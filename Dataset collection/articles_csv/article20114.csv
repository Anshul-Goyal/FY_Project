"'11-04-01,'1','Two billionaire brothers from Texas, Charles and Samuel Wyly, lost a bid to have claims of fraud and insider trading dismissed from a lawsuit brought against them by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The S.E.C., in a complaint filed July 29 after a six-year investigation, accused the brothers of using “an elaborate sham system of trusts and subsidiary companies” in the Isle of Man and Cayman Islands in a 13-year plot to hide their stock ownership in four public companies on whose boards they sat.Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday rejected arguments from the Wyly brothers to dismiss the charges and held that the S.E.C. had met deadlines for filing. The agency is seeking to impose penalties and to force the Wylys to turn over $550 million the S.E.C. says the brothers made.“Although we are disappointed in today’s decision, it was not entirely unexpected at this early stage of the legal process,” William A. Brewer III, lead counsel for the Wylys, said in an e-mailed statement. “The Wylys will continue to vigorously defend themselves — and they remain confident they will be fully vindicated.”The S.E.C has accused the Wylys, with help from their lawyer Michael C. French and a stockbroker, Louis J. Schaufele III, of transferring hundreds of millions of shares to the offshore entities to keep their holdings secret and to evade laws limiting stock transactions by corporate insiders.Mr. French and Mr. Schaufele are also defendants in the suit.Martin Auerbach, a lawyer for Mr. Schaufele, and Danny Ashby, who represents Mr. French, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the ruling.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','But the Haight has already felt the impact. Many believe that months of relentless, negative news coverage that painted the neighborhood as a war zone where gangs of young street thugs preyed on innocent pedestrians was a public relations debacle.“The publicity definitely hurt us,” said Jimmy Siegel, owner of Distractions, a Victorian steampunk clothing and head shop, which has operated on Haight Street for 35 years. “My business went down $100,000 last year.”Mr. Siegel said longtime customers from Bay Area suburbs “have been reading horrible things in the media” and staying away out of fear.The new ordinance, a device for thwarting vagrancy and street crime that bans sitting or lying on sidewalks, applies citywide. But the grass-roots effort for it began in the Haight, which made the neighborhood the primary focus of news coverage.“We became the poster child,” said Elisabeth Rix, a partner in several local businesses, including the Red Vic Movie House. “I had phone calls from friends who asked if it was safe to come to the Haight.”Ms. Rix agreed that there had been issues with intimidating teenage vagrants, but said, “I don’t think it’s as bad as it’s been portrayed at all.”Ted Loewenberg, president of the Haight Ashbury Improvement Association and a main proponent of sit/lie, disagreed with the notion that news media coverage surrounding the ordinance had caused damage. Any declines in business, he said, “were for other reasons,” including the recession.Mr. Loewenberg said he had no regrets for pushing sit/lie, believing instead that it will eventually make the street safer and more welcoming.“No one thought it was a light switch and with a flick things would instantly change,” he said. “It’s going to take time.”But the depiction of the Haight as dangerous has taken hold, especially online.On the social network Yelp, the majority of reviews (13 of 17) of Haight-Ashbury posted since March 2010 mention young street “punks.” In the preceding 12 months, only 1 of 14 reviews mentioned the issue.On the Web site Virtual Tourist, a posting in January said a woman had been “sexually assaulted” on Haight Street “by a young junkie, with several friends. He put his hand right up my skirt.” When the group confronted the man, she wrote, “in two seconds, there were like fifteen screaming junkies with dogs surrounding us.”They are accounts unlikely to attract tourists. In fact, 25 percent of visitors surveyed in a yearlong 2010 study released last week by the San Francisco Travel Association cited homelessness/panhandling as the top complaint.The study also showed that while tourism was up 3 percent citywide from 2009, the percentage of visitors that went to the Haight in 2010 dropped 19 percent from the first quarter to the fourth — the same time period as the sit/lie news coverage.Calvin Welch, a board member of Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council, a neighborhood group, said it had been an ill-fated decision by sit/lie proponents to associate the measure so intimately with the Haight. “It was commercial suicide,” Mr. Welch said, adding, “It was eerily out of whack with reality.”Mr. Welch, who has been in the neighborhood for four decades, said the Haight was actually better off now, having emerged from desperate times of drug dealing and violence in the 1980s and early 1990s.Many other longtime residents agree that over all the neighborhood is on an upswing.Nearly 70 businesses have joined a new group to get that message out. The Haight Ashbury Merchants Association, formed in January, has vowed to stay clear of politics and instead promote the streets’ attractions.David McLean, a restaurateur and the group’s board president, said the effort would counter the bad news coverage surrounding sit/lie. “If I check all these news stories with my day-to-day reality,” he said, “they don’t add up.”'"

On Wednesday, the school went into lockdown after a parent reported seeing a young man carrying a gun in his waistband on the school’s perimeter. Four people, including two Berkeley High students, were detained but no weapon was found.The issue appears to have divided many parents who are calling for more security and students who believe that their parents are overreacting.During a Berkeley school board meeting Wednesday night, Lias Djili, the board’s student representative, cautioned against making drastic changes.'"

"'11-04-01,'1','A judge on Thursday halted Gov. Scott Walker’s plans — at least temporarily — to cut most public workers’ pay and strip them of most of their union rights. Judge Maryann Sumi of Dane County Circuit Court issued a declaration stating in no uncertain terms that the collective bargaining law that led to weeks of protests had not taken effect, contradicting Republican arguments that it had because a state office published it online. Governor Walker, a Republican, said his administration would comply, despite misgivings. Democrats and union leaders said Judge Sumi’s declaration showed the arrogance that the governor and his allies, including a top aide, Secretary Mike Huebsch of the Department of Administration, have shown in trying to push through the law. Judge Sumi had issued an earlier order meant to stop the law’s implementation while she considered a challenge to its legitimacy. But her declaration put the governor and his legislative allies on the defensive, leaving them to decide between waiting for the legal challenge to be resolved and trying to pass the measure again.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Citing concerns about the national debt, a handful of conservative state legislators have blocked a vote to accept federal money to extend unemployment benefits, effectively cutting financial assistance for more than 10,000 out-of-work residents next week.The move, which came despite widespread bipartisan support for extending the benefits, puts Missouri at the center of a growing national discussion about reining in unemployment benefits at a time when both the job market and government coffers remain weakened.In recent weeks, Republican leaders in Michigan, Arkansas and Florida have taken steps to limit their states’ contributions by cutting the duration of unemployment benefits.But for now Missouri, with an unemployment rate above 9 percent, is the only state that has stopped accepting dedicated federal money to extend payments to 99 weeks from 79. (A number of states never joined when the program was initially offered.)“This is about sending a message to the federal government from the state of Missouri that enough is enough,” said Jim Lembke, the state senator who, with three other Republicans, is filibustering the legislation. “The federal government is sending us money they don’t have.”Mr. Lembke said he also plans to block a vote needed to accept nearly $190 million in federal education money.'"

He legged it out, beating a throw from Jayson Werth, the Washington Nationals’ new right fielder.“I was busting it out of the box,” Jones said. “Didn’t necessarily want to slide, but I had to.”He went on to score the season’s first run, Jason Heyward added a solo shot, and Derek Lowe allowed three singles in five and two-thirds innings on a chilly, damp opening day, helping the Braves beat the host Nationals to make Fredi Gonzalez a winner in his debut as Atlanta’s manager.The Braves played their first regular-season game since Bobby Cox retired at the end of 2010 after two decades — and 15 playoff appearances — as their skipper.“It doesn’t feel any different,” said Gonzalez, who previously managed the Florida Marlins. “A win’s a win.

"'11-04-01,'1','But the House proposal in Florida — in a high-unemployment state that already has some of the lowest benefits — takes it one step further by tying benefits to the unemployment rate. If the rate falls, so do the number of weeks of benefits. If the rate dips below 5 percent, the jobless would collect only 12 weeks of benefits, the lowest level.This has workers worried in Florida, where the unemployment rate, while continuing to inch down, is 11.5 percent, considerably higher than the nation’s rate of 8.9 percent. Michigan’s rate is 10.4 percent.The Senate is taking a less stringent approach in its bill, choosing not to reduce the number of weeks or tie benefits to the unemployment rate. The two chambers are expected to resolve their differences within the next few weeks.The House version, which would take effect Aug. 1 if signed into law and affect people who apply after that date, would also make it easier for businesses to fire employees, who would then not be eligible for unemployment benefits.The bill’s sponsor, Representative Doug Holder, a Sarasota Republican, said creating jobs is pivotal to keeping Floridians off the unemployment rolls. Businesses need the state’s help in doing that, Mr. Holder said. The average number of weeks people remain on unemployment compensation is 17.7 weeks, he added, and that means most people would be unaffected, at least in terms of how long they would collect benefits. More than 535,000 Floridians were receiving benefits as of March 26.“Florida is positioning itself to be the most business-friendly state in the country,” said Representative Holder, whose bill would also help weed out those who do not have legitimate claims. “Our unemployment compensation trust fund has gone broke. We have to replenish it. The best way to do that and to right a capsized economy is to provide more jobs.”“To talk about cutting the maximum number of weeks down to as low as 12 is basically accepting as a certainty that lots more people will run out of benefits before they find employment and that they will go many weeks without any income,” said George Wentworth, senior staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for workers. “It’s cruel as a matter of public policy, and it’s really kind of wrongheaded in terms of the local economy.”But the business community, led by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, has made passing the House version of the bill a priority, contending that businesses would benefit greatly from relief from the escalating tax to pay for jobless compensation. This year the tax on business owners jumped to $72.10 a year for each employee from $25.20, still relatively low, but it is expected to climb steeply because Florida’s unemployment fund is running a $2.1 billion deficit. Thirty other states are facing deficits in their unemployment programs.“This is our thorniest problem this year,” said Bill Herrle, Florida executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business. “There is no happy solution. It’s intractable. We have an enormous problem. Our take is that big problems require solutions from all the participants.”Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who has made job creation a cornerstone of his tenure, supports the House approach.But to some here in Flagler County, where the economy rose higher but fell harder than in any other in Florida in the past decade, the idea of creating jobs by taking away meager benefits from people whose lives have been upended does not seem just. From 2000 to 2010, this slice of Florida, just north of Daytona Beach, had the highest population growth in the state, spurred by construction as houses multiplied along vast stretches of open land. The collapse here was equally drastic. Construction jobs disappeared practically overnight, and the county now has the state’s highest unemployment rate, 14.9 percent.Jobs make news here. A few weeks ago word spread that new Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants in town were ready to hire. Hundreds lined up in the sun to file their applications. Only a few dozen were accepted.Standing outside the employment center here, Leslie Stultz, a trim 62-year-old man with a Jamaican lilt, said politicians were too quick to dismiss how difficult it was for some people to find jobs in this region of Florida, particularly for workers in their 50s and 60s. Relocating is out of the question when there is no money in the bank, Mr. Stultz said.He said he recently lost his temporary job performing quality control for a company that manufactures sunscreen. It was his second layoff in two years, he said. His wife, a home health care worker, has seen her income drop sharply. Now he is fighting with the bank to arrange affordable payments so he can keep his tidy white stucco house, decorated with Egyptian artwork and mirrors and with a pool out back, in one of Palm Coast’s many walled-off developments.“People aren’t sitting back relaxing and collecting $275 a week,” Mr. Stultz said. “There are no jobs here, and there are so many unemployed people.”Mr. Dudenhoeffer, whose kind eyes grow weary as he retells his journey from small-business owner to perpetual job seeker, said he could hear the clock ticking. He explained that he had exhausted his state benefits and was now collecting emergency federal benefits. He said he tried to be optimistic. And despite his grim situation, there are occasional moments of happiness. On his birthday recently, friends collected money to buy him a gift card for Red Lobster.Still, watching his online job applications simply fall into a void again and again, Mr. Dudenhoeffer said he could not help growing despondent.“When the benefits run out,” he said, “I’ll just give up.”'"
"'11-04-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The federal government should systematically collect demographic data on gay, lesbian and transgender people and should conduct biomedical research to understand why they are more likely to have certain chronic conditions, the National Academy of Sciences said Thursday.In a report requested by the National Institutes of Health, the academy proposed an ambitious research agenda to investigate the prevalence and causes of obesity, depression, cancer, heart disease and other conditions among gay people.Federal officials had asked the academy’s Institute of Medicine to identify gaps in research on the health of gay Americans. Dr. Robert O. Graham, the chairman of the panel that did the study, said that was impossible.“The available evidence on the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people is sparse,” said Dr. Graham, a professor of family medicine at the University of Cincinnati. “Researchers need to do much more than simply filling gaps.”The panel, appointed by the Institute of Medicine, said the government should finance research to develop standardized measures of sexual orientation and gender identity — “one’s basic sense of being a man, woman or other gender, such as transgender.”'"
"'11-04-01,'1','“It was inevitable, wasn’t it?” Mr. Naftali said. “This was a private institution with a particular point of view. It was accustomed to presenting the president in a certain light. I was coming in as a professional historian who was committed to making sure the facts were known.”Mr. Naftali said he had no interest in prolonging the disagreement with the Nixon Foundation, and declined to discuss negotiations with them.“I would actually like the healing to start,” he said. “I’m sure they are as tired of this fight as I am.”The archivist of the United States, David S. Ferriero, flew in for the ribbon-cutting, reflecting the national significance of the project. None of the foundation’s board members attended. The chairman, Ronald H. Walker, posted a statement on the foundation’s Web site that also appeared to take pains to end the battle.“Nearly 40 years after President Nixon left office, Watergate remains a controversial and much-studied subject,” he said. “It is, however, just one chapter in the enormously consequential life and career of the 37th president of the United States. The new Watergate exhibit at the Nixon Library represents one interpretation of the events that led to President Nixon’s resignation in 1974.”Sharon Fawcett, the assistant archivist for presidential libraries, said that other presidential libraries were making increased efforts to deal with difficult chapters of a presidency: Iran-contra is reflected in the Ronald Reagan library, and the library for Franklin D. Roosevelt notes his failure to respond to the Holocaust.This one, though, is, by any measure, far more harsh. The Watergate gallery is the largest one in the museum. In tone and substance, it is nothing like what one finds in presidential libraries devoted to Truman and Hoover, for example.The sections within the gallery have titles ranging from “Dirty Tricks and Political Espionage” to “Road to Resignation” to “The Coverup.” Panels on the wall invoke famous quotations, like “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” and one from a Time magazine editorial urging Nixon to resign, reading: “Richard Nixon and the nation have passed a tragic point of no return.”But the Watergate exhibition is particularly evocative because the curators were able to draw on two resources not available to most presidential libraries. For one thing, it draws on some of the 2,700 hours of secret tapes Nixon recorded in the Oval Office. With the push of a button, in a technology that Mr. Naftali likened to an iPad, a visitor can hear Nixon in incriminating conversations with associates in the Oval Office. His words scrawl along in text to help listeners decipher the often scratchy recordings.For another, the curators drew on 131 oral interviews they did with critical figures in the Nixon presidency and the scandal, in which they reflect on what happened. “We used the oral histories and the tapes to substantiate the claims that we express in these panels,” Mr. Naftali said.In one, Alexander M. Haig, who served as a Nixon chief of staff, told Mr. Naftali that Nixon had asked him to burn the tapes and that Mr. Haig had refused. At the same time, Mr. Haig has also said that Nixon’s biggest mistake was failing to destroy the tapes. In another, George P. Shultz, who was Treasury secretary under Nixon, said he had refused Nixon’s request to help him gather information for the president’s infamous enemies list.“I was being asked to do something improper, and I wouldn’t do it,” he said.At one point, responding to an early version of the exhibition, the foundation filed a 150-page report requesting significant alterations. The foundation said the exhibition failed to point out, for instance, that other presidents had also surreptitiously recorded people in the White House or gone after political enemies.Almost none of the requests made by the foundation was reflected in the final exhibition.A steady stream of visitors walked through after the opening, among them George A. Summerhill, 73, a retired paper manufacturer from Reno, Nev.“It’s devastating,” Mr. Summerhill said as he emerged from the end. “I mean, so many people felt Nixon betrayed his country.”Mr. Summerhill, who said he voted for Nixon, said the exhibition was fair and belonged in any presentation devoted to Nixon’s life. “I am looking at this and watching it with mixed emotions,” he said. “I have great respect for Richard Nixon. I can look past this.”'"
"'11-04-01,'1','Paralleling the death throes of a marriage and a 100-year-old tradition, “Circo” takes to the earthen roads of rural Mexico to document one of the Ponce family’s many traveling circuses.Known as the Gran Circo Mexico, this struggling caravan of lions, llamas, clowns and contortionists is constantly on the move. Stopping for only one or two days at a time, the 10-person outfit (5 adults and 5 children) toils in an endless cycle of loading and offloading, erecting and disassembling. For Tino Ponce, the ringmaster and jack of all trades, there is no other possible life, and his fierce love for the business is ample consolation for his lack of literacy.But his wife, Ivonne — who married into the circus — feels differently. “They give us too much,” she says, watching her young children juggle, contort and swing from silk streamers. The daily grind of chores, rehearsals and performances leaves little time for school, and Ivonne resents their unrelentingly laborious life and her father-in-law’s monopoly on their earnings. And though her children seem mostly content — while marveling that their peers in the towns they pass through do nothing but “go to school and play”— it soon becomes clear that the animals are not the only ones who are caged.The first feature from Aaron Schock (who also shot the film’s soft, smudged images), “Circo” offers a touching chronicle of a dying culture harnessed to ambitions that remain very much alive. Never mind the declining attendance, collapsing economy, backbreaking debt and intra-familial tensions; to Tino his circus is still the greatest show on earth.Produced and directed by Aaron Schock; written by Mr. Schock and Mark Becker; director of photography, Mr. Schock; edited by Mr. Becker; music by Calexico; produced by Jannat Gargi, Hecho a Mano Films and the Independent Television Service; released by First Run Features.

"'11-04-01,'1','Major outsourcing companies from India have been the biggest recipients of visas in recent years under a program intended to allow American companies to bring highly skilled foreign workers temporarily to the United States, an immigration scholar testified Thursday before a House of Representatives judiciary panel.Loopholes in the visa program have made it easy for the outsourcers “to bring in cheaper foreign workers, with ordinary skills, who directly substitute for, rather than complement, workers in America,” the scholar, Ronil Hira, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology who has studied the program, told the House Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement.Four of the five biggest users of the program from 2007 to 2009 were Indian outsourcing companies: Infosys, Wipro, Mahindra Satyam and Tata, Mr. Hira said. Microsoft was the only company with headquarters in the United States among the top five users, he said. Among them, the Indian companies sent 22,766 workers to the United States on temporary visas during the two deepest years of the recession.The hearing marked a new round in a rancorous tug of war over the visas, known as H-1B visas. Granted to foreign workers with at least a bachelor’s degree to work in the United States for up to three years, they have been used by computer companies to bring in technology experts.American companies are requesting an increase in the annual national limit of 65,000 temporary visas, saying it is too low and inflexible to meet their needs for engineers and scientists during unpredictable variations in the economy. But numerous cases have come to light of American workers who were ousted from jobs and replaced by workers from Indian outsourcing companies, often at lower wages.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','“Who Will Rescue Financial Reform?” (editorial, March 28) accurately exposes the House Republican majority’s “death by a thousand cuts” line of attack to eviscerate the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.While Republicans claim that their proposals to change Dodd-Frank encourage economic growth, if enacted, they would simply return us to the same reckless, self-destructive pre-financial crisis way of doing business that led to this mess in the first place.One of the thousand cuts is a misguided Republican initiative that would reopen a dangerous statutory gap now closed by the law. Before Dodd-Frank, credit rating agencies had no legal liability under federal law if they omitted or misstated material facts in securities registration statements.This legal “get out of jail free card” all but invited credit rating agencies to bestow “AAA” ratings on trillions of dollars of dubious debt despite deficient credit quality. And they did it with immunity. Investors viewed these ratings as authoritative statements when they were nothing more than well-informed “opinions.”Without holding the credit rating agencies to a standard of responsibility, as Dodd-Frank now does, the Republican proposal would put investors and the economy at risk again. Any Republican attempt to excuse credit rating agencies from accountability should be viewed with the deepest of skepticism.The writer, a New York Democrat, is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','I understand the motivation of food producers in reducing the amount of product inside the packaging, but I resent their assumption that I won’t notice. I do notice, and expect them to label packages accordingly.I look forward to the day when toilet paper is more accurately called toilet ribbon, tissue boxes specify that they are for single-nostril use, and a can of tuna, which once contained enough fish to make two sandwiches, will be labeled “tuna garnish.”I was not the first in my home to face the repercussions of shrinking food content in same-size packages. After feeding my cat what I thought was her usual 6.5-ounce can of food (half a can, twice a day), she began to protest. Nothing organized, of course, but she kept letting me know that she was hungry, although she had just been fed.Eventually, I read the can and saw that it had dropped to 5.5 ounces. Not only was there no notification, but the instructions for feeding, one can a day, were still the same.I wondered how many others who could not be heard — babies, young children or the elderly — have been given less when they expected and even needed more.Why not take the repackaging of food to hide increased costs in a different direction, and similar to stock splits to make purchases seemingly more affordable, apply this “revaluation” to some of the most pressing and controversial problems of the day?'"
"'11-04-01,'1','“The Pale King” is less inventive and exuberantly imagined than Wallace’s previous novels: no herds of feral hamsters roaming the land, no artificially created deserts in Ohio, no ad-bearing Statue of Liberty. But like “Infinite Jest” it depicts an America in thrall to myopic consumerism, and like his first novel, “The Broom of the System,” it grapples with corrugated questions of identity and the difficulties of communication.By turns breathtakingly brilliant and stupefying dull — funny, maddening and elegiac — “The Pale King” will be minutely examined by longtime fans for the reflexive light it sheds on Wallace’s oeuvre and his life. But it may also snag the attention of newcomers, giving them a window — albeit a flawed window — into this immensely gifted writer’s vision of the human condition as lived out in the middle of the middle of America, toward the end of the 20th century, by worker bees employed as number crunchers for the federal government, worried that they are going to be replaced by computers.Told in fragmented, strobe-lighted chapters that depict an assortment of misfits, outsiders and eccentrics, the novel sometimes feels like the TV show “The Office” as rewritten with a magnifying glass by Nicholson Baker. Sometimes it feels like a hallucinatory variation on Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio,” giving the reader a choral portrait of a Midwestern community — though in this case, that community is not a town, but the I.R.S. Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Ill., in 1985.Little happens dramatically in real time in this novel; rather, the graphic deaths and accidents chronicled in its pages are almost always part of its characters’ back stories. In fact “The Pale King” is in some ways an ode to stasis and perseverance, to the human ability to endure all the slings and arrows of monotony and everyday misfortune.Among those characters is a fictional version of the author himself — he claims that this novel is really a memoir — who says he took a year off from college to work at the I.R.S., “in exile from anything I even remotely cared about or was interested in” and who is mistaken there for a higher ranking employee also named David Wallace.This narrator named David Wallace says he “dreamed of becoming an ‘artist,’ i.e., somebody whose adult job was original and creative instead of tedious and dronelike,” and at times this narrator feels like a might-have-been version of the real author had he not become a writer — much the way that Harry Rabbit Angstrom feels like a might-have-been version of John Updike.The other characters include a sad sack named Sylvanshine, who regards himself as “a dithering ninny”; a colleague by the name of Cusk, who is embarrassed by his own heavy sweating; an executive named Stecyk, who was an “insufferable do-gooder” as a child; a beautiful woman named Meredith, who did a stint in a psych hospital; and a young man named Lane A. Dean Jr., who married his pregnant girlfriend even though he didn’t love her and now needs to support his new family.Wallace is focused on how various characters came to work at the I.R.S. — what combination of psychological tics, childhood trauma, financial circumstance and random luck propelled them into the rat race and tossed them onto the hamster wheel that is life as accountants there, pushing paper and numbers in a deadeningly generic office fitted with fluorescent lights, modular shelving and the ceaseless “whisper of sourceless ventilation.”Though at least one character argues that being an accountant is heroic — providing order in a chaotic world, corralling and organizing a torrential flow of information — Lane Dean, for one, feels that the work is “boredom beyond any boredom he’d ever felt,” and he begins thinking suicidal thoughts.“He felt in a position to say he knew now that hell had nothing to do with fires or frozen troops. Lock a fellow in a windowless room to perform rote tasks just tricky enough to make him have to think, but still rote, tasks involving numbers that connected to nothing he’d ever see or care about, a stack of tasks that never went down, and nail a clock to the wall where he can see it, and just leave the man there to his mind’s own devices.”Not surprisingly, a novel about boredom is, more than occasionally, boring. It’s impossible to know whether Wallace, had he finished the book, might have decided to pare away such passages, or whether he truly wanted to test the reader’s tolerance for tedium — to make us share the misery of his office workers, who come to remind us of the unhappy hero of Joseph Heller’s “Something Happened,” or some of Beckett’s bone-weary characters, stuck in a limbo of never-ending waiting and routine.The big clash in the novel pits old-school I.R.S. employees, “driven by self-righteousness,” against newer ones with a corporate desire “to maximize revenue.” We have to slog through stultifying technical talk about “the distinctions between §162 and §212(2) deductions related to rental properties,” and inside-baseball accounts of obscure battles within the I.R.S. hierarchy. There is even one chapter that consists of little but a series of I.R.S. workers turning page after page after page.Yet at the same time there are some wonderfully evocative sections here that capture the exhausting annoyances of everyday life with digital precision. The sticky, nauseating feeling of traveling on a small, crowded commuter plane, crammed up against “paunched and blotchy men in double-knit brown suits and tan suits with attaché cases ordered from in-flight catalogs.” Or the suffocating feeling of being stuck on a filthy bus, with ashtrays spilling over with gum and cigarette butts, the air-conditioning “more like a vague gesture toward the abstract idea of air-conditioning” than the real thing.In this, his most emotionally immediate work, Wallace is on intimate terms with the difficulty of navigating daily life, and he conjures states of mind with the same sorcery he brings to pictorial description. He conveys the gut deep sadness people experience when “the wing of despair” passes over their lives, and the panic of being a fish “thrashing in the nets” of one’s own obligations, stuck in a miserable job and needing to “cover the monthly nut.”Along the way he gives us chilling, Grand Guignol scenes involving a ghastly subway accident and a grotesque industrial-arts class accident. And he makes us see, with gorgeous sleight of hand, the “very old land” in a Middle America that exists somewhere between Grandma Moses and “Blue Velvet”: the “flannel plains” and “the tobacco-brown river overhung with weeping trees and coins of sunlight,” an “arrow of starlings fired from the windbreak’s thatch,” a “sunflower, four more, one bowed, and horses in the distance standing rigid and still as toys. All nodding.”This novel reminds us what a remarkable observer Wallace was — a first-class “noticer,” to use a Saul Bellow term, of the muchness of the world around him, chronicling the overwhelming data and demands that we are pelted with, second by second, minute by minute, and the protean, overstuffed landscape we dwell in.It was in trying to capture that hectic, chaotic reality — and the nuanced, conflicted, ever-mutating thoughts of his characters — that Wallace’s synesthetic prose waxed so prolix, his sentences unspooling into tangled skeins of words, replete with qualifying phrases and garrulous footnotes. And this is why his novels, stories and articles so often defied closure and grew and grew and grew, sprouting tendrils and digressions and asides — because in almost everything Wallace wrote, including “The Pale King,” he aimed to use words to lasso and somehow subdue the staggering, multifarious, cacophonous predicament that is modern American life.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','ASTANA, Kazakhstan — On the eve of an election in which Kazakhstan’s strongman leader hopes to improve his democratic credentials, a prominent opposition newspaper announced on Thursday that its publisher had suffered a severe beating and that his whereabouts were unknown.The paper, Golos Respublika, which has been highly critical of President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s government, called a news conference in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital, to express concern about its publisher, Danyar O. Moldashev.“The single thing we know is that he is alive,” said Oksana Makushina, a deputy editor of the paper.On Saturday, Mr. Moldashev suffered a concussion and a broken arm when he was beaten outside his apartment by assailants who took a camera and documents, Ms. Makushina said. After being released from the hospital, he abruptly left the country, telling his brother that he was going to Ukraine. Instead, he called on Wednesday night to say he was in Belarus, and he has not been reachable since, said his brother, Akhsar.A police spokesman would not respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but authorities released a statement saying that Mr. Moldashev had traveled to Kiev on personal business, and that a “supplementary investigation did not confirm information about Mr. Moldashev’s supposed robbery and abduction.”The episode was notable because it took place before Sunday’s election, just the third since the fall of Communism in which multiple candidates had vied for the presidency.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','Ernie Paragallo, a thoroughbred breeder and owner, lost his appeal of his conviction for animal cruelty charges on Thursday. He was convicted on 33 counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and sentenced to two years in prison last year for starving his horses at his Center Brook Farm in Greene County, N.Y.Paragallo, 52, of Long Island, maintained that a report issued before his sentencing last May was prejudicial and asked that his sentence be overturned. But the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court said that Judge George J. Pulver Jr. of Greene County Court did not consider that information in handing down his two-year sentence.Paragallo was convicted after a nonjury trial in March after Pulver heard testimony from veterinarians and horse rescue workers about the condition of many of the 177 horses on Paragallo’s farm in Climax, N.Y., about 20 miles south of Albany.Also Thursday, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board permanently barred Paragallo from entering any New York racetracks and prohibited him from ever acquiring a racing license again in New York.“The actions today by my board send a strong signal that there is no place for anyone in the racing industry who mistreats horses and obfuscates his connection to horses that run on our tracks,” said John D. Sabini, chairman of the state Racing and Wagering Board.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','So they added Soriano against the wishes of General Manager Brian Cashman, whose vocal stance at the introductory news conference reached Soriano’s friends and family back home in the Dominican Republic.Early in spring training Soriano sought Cashman out for an explanation. Satisfied, he said he was “comfortable so far” with his new job after closing last season for Tampa Bay, and on Thursday he came in for a superb Chamberlain and retired two of the Tigers’ lethal hitters, Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez, as part of his handiwork.“We’re going to need that,” Manager Joe Girardi said.The ending, as overpowering as it was orderly, fulfilled a prediction offered before the game by Derek Jeter, who quipped, “Don’t expect too much from the hitters today.”They combined for 11 hits, as Sabathia and the Tigers’ ace right-hander, Justin Verlander, each worked six innings, departing with the score tied at 3-3.Opening days had not been kind to Sabathia, at least not with the Yankees — a 10.24 earned run average in two starts. But he said he had a better feel for his pitches Thursday, especially of his two-seam fastball and slider, which he threw early to get ahead.Sabathia bemoaned his failure to put away hitters, allowing four of his six hits with two strikes — including Brandon Inge’s two-out, run-scoring single in the fourth. But he could have escaped with a lead had it not been for an fifth-inning error by Robinson Cano, which led to an unearned run.Sabathia’s last five starts against Detroit have come opposite Verlander, whose dominant spring training — 0.96 earned run average in 28 innings — prepared him for a lineup that approached him with a definite strategy.Facing him in miserable weather — a wind-chill of 31 degrees — is unappealing, and so the Yankees focused on driving up his pitch count. None of the five players who batted in the first inning took a swing before the fourth pitch of the at-bat, forcing Verlander to throw 31 over all.In drawing a walk, Teixeira saw seven pitches, and he came up in the third with a more aggressive plan. He drilled a 1-1 fastball deep into the second deck in right field, only his second hit in 18 at-bats against Verlander.A notoriously slow starter, Teixeira did not his first homer last year until his 12th game. But he addressed those struggles in a January tutorial with the hitting coach Kevin Long, who focused on improving his mechanics while batting from the left side. Teixeira could often be found hitting alone in the batting cages beneath Steinbrenner Field in spring training, taking swing after swing, and on Thursday he saw results.“I’ve been petitioning the league to start in March for years now,” Teixeira said, laughing. “Finally they let us start in March because everyone knows about my Aprils.”People who pay close attention to April statistics may also know about Granderson’s unusual success, a streak that was jeopardized by an injury March 22 to his right oblique muscle. When he left Tampa, Fla., on Wednesday night after playing in a minor league game, Granderson was hopeful, though unsure, that he would play Thursday.In the first inning, he made a diving catch. In the seventh, after the left-hander Phil Coke replaced Verlander, Granderson, a left-handed hitter, mashed a ball into the second deck in right field, his third consecutive opening day with a home run.His homer last April 4 in Boston could not offset what became a challenging season, marked by injury and ineffectiveness, but Granderson said he was much more comfortable in his second year with the Yankees.“All of the firsts are out of the way, you know,” Granderson said, adding: “I knew of the city and the fans, and now I know how it is. So all those question marks are gone, versus looking forward to it, like I am now.”His final highlight came in the ninth, when, playing shallow to account for the wind, he raced down Inge’s fly to deep center.As the replay was shown on the high-definition video screen, fans roared and clapped (their gloved hands), and Rivera gawked in appreciation.One out later, the crowd applauded Rivera and the blueprint victory — and the chance to go home happy and warm.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','BRUSSELS — Google played down the significance of an antitrust complaint filed by one of its main rivals, Microsoft, on Thursday and said its discussions were continuing with European Union regulators.“We’re not surprised that Microsoft has done this, since one of their subsidiaries was one of the original complainants,” said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels.Google was “happy to explain to anyone how our business works,” Mr. Verney said.Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for E.U. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said Google would be given “an opportunity to comment and to give its own version of the facts” following the complaint.Ms. Torres emphasized that the E.U. investigation of Google was still at a “preliminary stage.”Even so, the complaint significantly raises the stakes in Europe for Google, which is already the subject of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation opened by Mr. Almunia in November.Google controls more than 90 percent of the market for Internet search in some parts of Europe and is well ahead of Bing, a rival search engine developed by Microsoft. Google’s search engine and its other sites have become hubs for advertisers and generate huge revenue for the company.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','PARIS — Although France has avoided most of the global anti-nuclear backlash prompted by the Fukushima reactor crisis, there is a serious, if quiet, reassessing of the risks here in a country that obtains nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power.Even though there is little talk about shifting away from the industry, comments this week by top French officials made it clear that there would be changes here that were likely to have an effect on the worldwide reckoning with nuclear power, given France’s long history with the industry.The head of France’s Nuclear Safety Authority, André-Claude Lacoste, made some of that process public on Wednesday when he told members of Parliament that the country would draw the necessary lessons from the Japanese experience and upgrade safety procedures. The most urgent task — and one that Mr. Lacoste acknowledged had been neglected — is a re-evaluation of the potential effects of natural disasters on nuclear safety.“Nobody can guarantee that there will never be a nuclear accident in France,” he warned.President Nicolas Sarkozy underscored the point on Thursday, when he traveled to Japan and called for new nuclear safety guidelines for all countries in the Group of 20, over which he currently presides.“Japan is not alone,” said Mr. Sarkozy, who was the first foreign leader to visit Japan since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami devastated the coast north of Tokyo and set off the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station.'"
"'11-04-01,'1','GENEVA — A letter bomb exploded at the office of a Swiss nuclear industry lobbying group on Thursday, slightly injuring two employees, a police spokesman said.The letter bomb exploded at the fourth floor office of Swissnuclear in the northern town of Olten at 7.:45 local time as personnel were opening the mail, Andreas Mock, a spokesman for the local police said. Mr. Mock said that a woman employee suffered injuries to her hands and arms and another employee complained of hearing problems as a result of the explosion.No group has claimed responsibility for the blast, Mr. Mock said.Controversy in Switzerland over nuclear power has increased since the crisis at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station resulting from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Switzerland operates five nuclear power stations but Japan’s nuclear disaster prompted Swiss Energy Minister Doris Leuthard to suspend requests to build two new plants and to order a review of safety at the existing Swiss plants.'"

"'11-04-02,'0','The only opening day no-hitter remains the one thrown by Bob Feller in 1940, 22 years before the birth of the Mets, and Harris said he had no fear the Mets would become the second such victims.“I knew the entire time that we weren’t going to get no-hit,” said Harris, who compared Johnson to another National League ace, Ubaldo Jimenez of the Colorado Rockies.Johnson lasted six and two-thirds innings and gave up two runs, three hits and two walks. The Mets’ only base runner through six innings was Ike Davis, who drew a walk in the second. Johnson set down the next 13 Mets in a row.While Johnson was dominating, Mike Pelfrey fell victim to a case of overthrowing, perhaps from the adrenaline of his first opening day start.Standing in as the opening day starter for the injured Johan Santana, Pelfrey had a difficult time, surrendering five earned runs in four and a third innings. The biggest blow was a grand slam by John Buck, the Marlins’ catcher, in the fourth inning. It provided all the runs the Marlins would need.Pelfrey loaded the bases by sandwiching a pair of walks around a double by Gaby Sanchez. The walk to Logan Morrison to load the bases was semi-intentional. The hope was to induce a ground-ball double play from Buck.But in an eight-pitch at-bat, Buck worked the count to 2-2 and fouled off three consecutive pitches before ripping the final offering to right-center field, where the ball landed in the first row of the stands as Carlos Beltran, newly installed in right field, looked up in vain.“It’s not the way I wanted to start the year,” Pelfrey said. “I’ve definitely got to do better than that.”The Mets did score two runs off Johnson, and had pinch-hitter Scott Hairston at the plate as the potential trying run with two outs in the seventh. But reliever Michael Dunn struck him out to end the threat.Johnson came into the game with a 7-1 record and 2.74 earned run average in 12 career starts against the Mets, with his only loss coming in last year’s opening day game at Citi Field, when the Mets tagged him for four runs in five innings. This year, in a different ballpark, there was an entirely different outcome.The first pitch of the season came at 7:21 p.m. with Jose Reyes looking at a ball from Johnson. He eventually grounded out, and Johnson got Harris to fly out before striking out David Wright looking at a front-door breaking ball. It was the first time Wright had seen that particular pitch from Johnson, whom he has been facing since 2006.Johnson throws a fastball in the upper 90s, a vicious slider and a terrific changeup. Now the Mets hitters must also be aware of the pitch that struck out Wright.Over the next 161 games, the Mets hope to shed their reputation as chaotic losers. Trying to start the transformation by beating one of the best pitchers in baseball was a difficult assignment.“We ran up against one of the best pitchers in the league,” said Wright, who went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts, “and he had his best stuff tonight.”'"
"'11-04-02,'0','PHOENIX — Arizona’s Medicaid program, criticized last year when it halted some organ transplants to save money, has come up with another cost-saving measure that has people talking.Following the lead of some private health plans, which charge premiums to members who smoke or engage in other unhealthy behavior, Arizona’s Health Care Cost Containment System has proposed charging smokers $50 a year and applying a similar fee to diabetes patients who do not follow their doctor’s orders to lose weight, said Monica Coury, a spokeswoman for the state Medicaid agency.“This is an annual fee that says to consumers, ‘Hey, we’re not going to prevent you from smoking, but you have to put a little bit more into the system because it costs us more,’ ” Ms. Coury said, citing a 2006 survey that showed that 46 percent of the patients in the state’s Medicaid program were smokers.As for being overweight, Ms. Coury said the cash-strapped agency would not be weighing people and slapping a fine on those carrying extra pounds. Rather, the $50 would be charged to those who were specifically urged by doctors to lose weight for health reasons, like diabetes, but failed to do so, she said.“We don’t care how much you weigh,” she said. “We care if you are doing something you should be doing to manage your disease.”The proposal was mentioned in a letter that Gov. Jan Brewer wrote Thursday to Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, seeking federal approval for a variety of cost-saving moves.'"
"'11-04-02,'0','Still, the novelty of organizations going out of business once their work is done has attracted attention.“I don’t think it’s going to be a widespread phenomenon because there are a lot of groups taking on problems like alcoholism and domestic violence that aren’t problems that go away,” said Jan Masaoka, editor in chief of Blue Avocado, a blog for nonprofits. “But I do see that in some cases there is an opportunity for organizations to wind down gracefully and with their job done.”Out2Play, an organization started by Andrea Wenner in 2005, plans to close its doors next year. The group has put up roughly 120 playgrounds used by about 80,000 children in public elementary schools around New York City and is fast running out of locations, in part because the Bloomberg administration liked the idea so much that it took on some schools itself.“When I first wrote the business plan, I thought about expanding it to other cities or into other types of institutions, like housing projects or hospitals, and we talked about those ideas and others when the board began seeing the end in sight,” Ms. Wenner said.Ultimately, though, the board decided that the model worked best for the purpose it had served and that anything else would require more than a simple tweak.“For example, in a housing project, you would still need someone to take kids to the playground and supervise them,” Ms. Wenner said.In the end, said Robert Daum, chairman of Out2Play’s board, “we just decided to declare victory and go home. Money is a scarce resource, and there are lots of other good causes out there, so there is no point in hitting up our friends and contacts for gifts simply to perpetuate the organization.”Out2Play is working to complete roughly 40 more playgrounds before it closes. It plans to leave behind an endowment to cover some of the maintenance costs associated with the playgrounds, Ms. Wenner said.“Right now, I think of it as very exciting because there’s a great sense of accomplishment that goes along with it, but I’m sure on the final day, I’ll have a strange feeling, probably bittersweet,” she said.Executives who have closed nonprofits say a feeling of pride overcomes any potential regrets. “Knowing that we were going to close helped us work with extreme urgency and intensity and not slack off for a minute,” said David Douglas, a founder of Water Advocates, a charity that closed late last year.Over its five years, Water Advocates raised more than $100 million. Its goal was to increase awareness of water issues, as well as to pull together the efforts of a wide range of organizations. The open knowledge that Water Advocates was destined to go out of business helped it encourage greater collaboration among those various groups.“We weren’t trying to attract attention to ourselves, which allowed us to focus on the issue itself, and we were always looking at ways to hand off things to other nonprofit groups,” he said. “And we weren’t competing for money, which also helped us build relationships.”British philanthropy circles recently have been talking about the decision to close the Otto Schiff Housing Association, a nonprofit set up in 1933 to provide assistance to displaced Jews. In its latest incarnation, the organization operated a number of homes for victims of Nazi persecution.“Our client group was clearly diminishing by virtue of demographics, and the homes were increasingly unsuitable for use because they were aging,” said Ashley Mitchell, who was brought in to revamp the association. Otto Schiff identified two other nonprofit groups, Jewish Care and World Jewish Relief, to take on its operations and began selling off the homes.“We thought maybe those assets would sell for 8 to 10 million pounds,” Mr. Mitchell said, equivalent to $13 million to $16 million. “The last ones will be sold in a month, and I hope they will have raised a gross of £60 million,” or roughly $97 million, much more than expected.About 85 percent of that money is going to the organizations taking on Otto Schiff’s services, and the remainder will be left in a foundation and spent out over the next five years or so, Mr. Mitchell said.“We had an operational imperative to do this because of the maintenance requirements of the homes, but it also made sense because our client base was dwindling,” he said.In some ways, that is the argument Mr. Case makes for closing Malaria No More. Roughly 80 percent to 85 percent of the population at risk of contracting malaria had received bed nets and other interventions by the end of last year, he said, and there has been a significant drop in mortality caused by malaria over the last decade. “It’s not just Malaria No More’s work, of course, but it does mean we are getting close to our goal,” he said.He said operating with the knowledge that the group would close had shaped how it operated and perhaps made it more effective. “It meant that we worked to increase public awareness of malaria as an issue rather than promote our brand,” Mr. Case said. “And it meant we didn’t have to worry as much about protecting the brand, so we could be edgier and think outside the box more.”What will happen to Malaria No More’s employees is perhaps Mr. Case’s biggest concern.But Martin Edlund, who has worked for the organization since its founding in 2006, said that he was more excited about the significance of its ending. “We talk around here about malaria being the first great humanitarian success story of the 21st century, and I comfort myself at night knowing that if I have that accomplishment on my résumé, I’m not going to have any trouble finding another job,” he said.'"
"'11-04-02,'0','State officials announced an agreement on Friday that could delay cuts to the Long Island Bus service in Nassau County that would have meant the end of trips for 16,000 of 100,000 riders.Officials said the State Senate had come up with $8.6 million to keep the service running at its current levels until the end of the year. The action came a week after hundreds of angry bus riders packed a hearing at Hofstra University to protest the proposed cuts, which would eliminate more than half of the routes in Nassau County. The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the system, had been scheduled to vote on the changes at its meeting on April 21. They were scheduled to take effect at the beginning of July.“A number of communities in Nassau County would have lost bus service entirely, leaving riders who live and work in those communities with no alternative way to get to their homes or jobs,” Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., a Republican and chairman of the Transportation Committee, said in a statement. “Riders are tired of hearing about problems; they want to hear solutions and we were happy to finally achieve a solution.”The solution, if enacted, is likely to be temporary. The Nassau County executive, Edward P. Mangano, has said the county would find a private operator to run the system rather than come up with the $26 million the transportation authority was demanding as the county’s share. Traditionally Nassau has benefitted from a subsidy that other large suburbs have not received; the authority is ending that subsidy.What will happen at the end of the year is unclear. Mr. Mangano has proposed reducing the county’s contribution to $4.1 million for a private contractor from the $9.1 million it pays the transportation authority. Critics say the county cannot continue its current level of service even at the proposed level of support.'"
"'11-04-02,'0','Almost upon the announcement of the repeal law, a group of nine senators — four students and five faculty members — created the so-called Taskforce on Military Engagement, which held three town-hall-style meetings in February that occasionally turned bitter. At one of the meetings, a wounded military veteran was heckled briefly by the crowd.“What you had was a couple of groups who don’t normally talk to one another,” said James H. Applegate, an astronomy professor and member of the task force. “There was a large presence of veterans, but also of students whose perspective was that the U.S. was an imperial, war-monger, colonial oppressor.”Some opponents of the resolution criticized the process preceding the vote as rushed and ineffectual.Sean Udell, the senior class president, said a task force set up to debate a universitywide smoking ban, for instance, had taken almost two years to do its work, not the few months taken by the military engagement group. “Clearly there was a lot of pressure coming from the administration to get this done,” Mr. Udell said. “To me, what this says is that there’s an agenda here.”In early March, officials at Harvard announced that they would formally recognize the Naval R.O.T.C. 40 years after the program was banned. Since the signing of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” repeal law, other universities have publicly expressed a similar interest in bringing back the armed forces officers’ group, which has units at more than 300 campuses nationwide.For reasons both of history and institutional character, however, none has the importance of Columbia, which was home to a particularly vigorous chapter of Students for a Democratic Society — some of whose most militant members helped to form the left-wing radical group the Weathermen.One former Weatherman, Brian Flanagan, who still lives in the Columbia area, was unrepentantly critical of the military and the R.O.T.C. in a brief interview on Friday.“The U.S. armed forces are a blight on the planet,” Mr. Flanagan said. “I don’t support soldiers — I think they’re war criminals. So obviously, I’m against R.O.T.C. coming back.”Before the Vietnam War, Columbia had a long and mostly cordial rapport with the armed forces. Dwight D. Eisenhower once served as its president, and crucial research for the Manhattan Project was conducted in Pupin Hall. Columbia provided more young officers during World War II than the Naval Academy did, said N. Rudy Rickner, a former Marine Corps pilot and the departing president of a campus veterans group.“The conversation between the military and the university has traveled through an arc,” said Mr. Rickner, a business school student. “Veterans and people who come here to study have not always had the kind of interaction they should have had for the last 30 years. Now they will.”At least, they might. It remains unclear if the armed forces will accept an invitation to return to campus. Officials from the Army and Navy could not be reached on Friday evening for comment.At the very least, the Senate vote has “taken the military out of the realm of the taboo,” said Ron Mazor, a member of the task force and a second-year law school student who voted for the resolution.Professor Applegate said: “This is a culmination of something going back several years. Back in the ’60s, students kicked R.O.T.C. off campus. But in 2011, students brought them back.”'"

"'11-04-02,'0','A FEW years ago, the Federal Reserve remained complacent about inflation even as a housing bubble inflated. The Fed did not take the kind of action that would have seemed reasonable if it had been alarmed by rising prices.Now the inflation rate is starting to turn up, and there are warnings that the Fed may need to tighten monetary policy even if the stumbling economic recovery does not accelerate. But home prices, which had seemed to be stabilizing a year ago, are falling again.Until 1983, the Consumer Price Index included housing costs. But then the index was changed. No longer would home prices directly affect the index. Instead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes a calculation of “owners’ equivalent rent,” which is based on the trend of costs to rent a home, not to buy one. The current approach, the B.L.S. says, “measures the value of shelter to owner-occupants as the amount they forgo by not renting out their homes.” The C.P.I. is not supposed to include investments, and owning a house has aspects of both investment and consumption.Whatever the reasonableness of that approach, the practical effect of the change was to keep the housing bubble from affecting reported inflation rates in the years leading up to the peak in home prices. It is at least possible that the Federal Reserve would have acted differently had the change never been made.The accompanying charts represent an effort to put together an alternate index of inflation, one that includes home prices rather than the owner’s equivalent rate. The effort is far from precise, in large part because the old index was based not just on purchase prices but also on changing mortgage interest rates and on changing property taxes, while this one is based solely on an index of home prices. But it nonetheless gives an approximation of what inflation would have looked like had home prices remained in the index.The effect is particularly notable in the core index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, and which the Fed monitors closely. In 2004, when home prices were climbing at a rate of almost 10 percent a year — more than four times the increase in rents — the core index would have been over 5 percent had home prices been included. Instead, the reported core rate was just 2.2 percent.'"
"'11-04-02,'0','The investigation was prompted by the 2004 sale of the Dolce & Gabbana and D&G brands to a Luxembourg holding company that prosecutors claimed was merely a front to let the fashion house pay lower taxes. Prosecutors also charged that the brands had been sold for a fraction of their actual value to minimize taxes. The brands were sold for 360 million euros, but investigators calculated that their true worth was closer to 1.2 billion euros.Prosecutors had accused all seven defendants of fraud, a charge that defense lawyers rejected.The two designers were also charged with not paying taxes on undeclared income of more than 400 million euros each.For the defense, Mr. Dinoia had presented the judge with a 150-page rebuttal of the charges, arguing that the prosecutors based their assumptions on a hypothetical value.“They were accused of not paying taxes on money they had never received,” Mr. Dinoia said after Friday’s hearing. “This is an excellent decision that guarantees the rights of all citizens.”Mr. Dinoia confirmed that a case was open with the tax authorities, but said he was confident that the judge in the fiscal action “would arrive at the same conclusion.”The designers, he said, had paid all the taxes they owed “down to the last penny.” Through the fashion house, the designers declined to comment.“The fraud charge was unusual” for a fiscal case, “and unsustainable,” as the decision showed Friday, said Giuseppe Bana, the defense lawyer for Luciano Patelli, the tax consultant to the fashion house. “This case should have never gone before a judge at all.”Laura Pedio, the prosecutor who oversaw the investigation, said she had not expected the exoneration and would wait for Judge Luerti to file his opinion before deciding whether to appeal the ruling. The judge has 30 days to file.“I have no idea how this will end from a fiscal point of view,” she said.'"

"'11-04-03,'0','“There’s always enough room for a few superstars,” Stoudemire said. “It’s just a matter of us continuing to win and continuing to play together as a team. That’s the most important thing. I can give a little of the spotlight and take some of the light off of me.”In his last three games, Anthony is averaging 38 points. The Knicks required all of them to squeeze out victories against Orlando and the Nets in the past two games and halt a tailspin. The Knicks (37-38) can clinch their first playoff berth in seven seasons Sunday if they beat Cleveland (for the first time in 12) games and if Charlotte loses to Washington.Anthony’s hot streak must seem familiar to Stoudemire, who set a franchise record with nine consecutive games with 30 or more points this season. In three of the past six games, however, he has 16 or fewer.“I think he’s kind of tired of trying to go out there and score 30 or 40 points,” Anthony said. “He’s been doing that this whole season. He’s been carrying the team on his back this whole season and having an M.V.P. year, having one of the best seasons of his career so far. So for him to have somebody else on his team and a couple of guys who can help him out, that’s perfect for him. He doesn’t have to go out there and score 30 to 35 points in order for us to win.”But if Stoudemire does not score that many, Anthony usually has to for the Knicks to win. Lately, Anthony has taken on more of that responsibility, especially late in games.Both players have adapted since becoming teammates, according to an analysis by Synergy Sports Technology. In the fourth quarter of games with the Knicks, the number of times that Anthony has gone one-on-one with a defender has accounted for 33 percent of his total plays, as opposed to 45 percent with Denver. Stoudemire is being used less in the post and in pick-and-rolls and more in isolation (which may have less to do with Anthony and more to do with the departure of point guard Raymond Felton, now with Denver). His field-goal percentage in the post has also dipped from 62.5 percent in the fourth quarter before the trade to 44.4 percent.Both are shooting more jumpers — 8.4 percent more for Stoudemire and 5.2 percent for Anthony, according to Synergy, which logs and tracks each N.B.A. game.“They added an isolation specialist in Carmelo that really neutralizes Amar’e, and when Amar’e does get touches, it turns him into an isolation player, too,” said an Eastern Conference scout who has seen the Knicks play several games since the trade. “When you have isolation players and not flow players, the defense gets set easier. When one of them makes a great one-on-one move, the defense is set and they know where you want to go, and then the help comes. You take more difficult shots with less time on the shot clock. They have to win games off sheer talent, and that’s tough.”The scout said that Stoudemire and his teammates were still trying to settle into a rhythm.“Everybody is a Monday morning quarterback in figuring out what needs to happen after it happens,” the scout said of Stoudemire and Anthony’s adapting to each other, adding, “It takes time.”'"
"'11-04-03,'0','ABUJA, Nigeria (Reuters) — After polls opened in Nigeria on Saturday, parliamentary elections were suddenly postponed for a week because, officials said, many areas had yet to receive voting materials.Parliamentary elections, which had been rescheduled to start Monday, will now take place on April 9, while the presidential vote is set for April 16, Attahiru Jega, head of the Independent National Electoral Commission, said Sunday in Abuja, the capital. The following week, voters will choose the governors and legislatures of Nigeria's 36 states, he said.The problems were a major blow to hopes of a break with a history here of electoral chaos and fraud. Failed elections could raise questions about how well-entrenched democracy is, more than a decade after the end of military rule.In a televised address on Saturday, Mr. Jega said, “The decision we have taken is weighty indeed, but it is an important step in further ensuring the credibility of the 2011 elections.”But the opposition questioned the legitimacy of the postponement.“Our initial reaction is that we suspect there is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the elections and undermine the electoral commission,” said Yinka Odumakin, a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler and the main rival to President Goodluck Jonathan in presidential elections. Mr. Buhari said Mr. Jonathan’s party “is afraid to let people come out and vote.”The voting materials had not arrived in the capital, Abuja, and other regions, including Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom States in the southern oil-producing Niger Delta, Plateau State in the central “Middle Belt” and Borno in the remote northeast.'"

"'11-04-03,'0','Across sub-Saharan Africa, an extreme shortage of health workers remains a critical barrier to fighting illness. The region bears a quarter of the world’s burden of disease, but has only 3 percent of its health care workers, according to the World Health Organization.Public health experts say efforts like the one involving Dr. Young have proved particularly useful on a continent that sorely needs pediatricians, surgeons and other specialists to train African doctors and nurses in the field.And demand for such opportunities is rising. More than 70 universities in the United States and Canada now offer formal academic programs in global health, most of them developed in just the past five years, according to the Consortium of Universities for Global Health.“Today’s students really want to make a difference in the world,” said Michael H. Merson, director of Duke University’s Global Health Institute. “They have a passion for sacrifice and service. It reminds me of the ’60s.”The children of powerful politicians are part of this new generation of global health enthusiasts. Vanessa Kerry, 34, a Harvard-trained doctor and the daughter of Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is advocating a Peace Corps-like federal program that would send American doctors and nurses to work and train health workers in developing countries.And Barbara Bush, 29, a daughter of former President George W. Bush, co-founded the nonprofit Global Health Corps, which this year sent 36 college graduates from eight countries to work with nonprofit groups, mostly in Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and Uganda. More than 1,000 people applied for the yearlong fellowships.The Pediatric AIDS Corps that sent Dr. Young here, largely financed by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation and the Baylor College of Medicine, never advertised for applicants after the first class of doctors was recruited in 2005. Word of mouth produced far more highly qualified physicians from universities all over the United States than the project could ever hire.In addition to the salary, the program paid down as much as $40,000 of the doctors’ educational debt for each year of service — making it possible for Dr. Young to join, though he owed $170,000 after his undergraduate and medical studies. His mother was an assembly-line worker, and in hard times the family relied on Medicaid. Dr. Young himself never had a steady pediatrician as a child.With a laugh, he said that his friends back home asked him if he had running water or used an outhouse in Africa. “We’re not roughing it here by any means,” he tells them. He drives a 10-year-old Opel Corsa, but lives in a pleasant town house in the sleepy capital, Maseru, with wireless Internet and a housekeeper who comes twice a week. For the first time in his life, he has gone skiing — in Lesotho’s breathtaking mountains.But it is the work that gives the job its meaning, the doctors say. Lineo Thahane attended Princeton University and got her medical degree at Washington University in St. Louis. It was a 2003 rotation in Lesotho’s main public hospital during her residency — when children were still dying of AIDS for lack of antiretroviral treatment — that made her want to return to Africa. Her parents were both from Lesotho, but she was born and raised in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.Dr. Thahane, 35, joined the first crop of Pediatric AIDS Corps doctors in Lesotho, and now helps her mother, Dr. Edith Mohapi, 64, who for 20 years managed pediatric outpatient services at Arlington Hospital in Virginia, to run Baylor’s pediatric H.I.V. programs in Lesotho.“I felt, ‘This is where the need is,’ ” Dr. Thahane said.Over the past five years, the corps has had 50 to 60 doctors working in Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi and Botswana. The hospitals and clinics they supervise now care for more than 50,000 H.I.V.-positive children, Baylor estimates.The project’s impact should also last beyond its financing, which ends in June. The 128 doctors who served in the corps in the past five years trained about 3,000 African professionals, who will carry on. And in July, Baylor will start another project with 32 pediatricians to work on a broader array of diseases.Dr. Grace Phiri, an overworked Malawian who has been the only pediatrician in Lesotho’s government service for most of the past 17 years, said the arrival of 10 AIDS Corps doctors in 2006 — just as AIDS drugs for children were becoming more widely available — drastically improved the survival chances of H.I.V.-positive children.Until 2005, not a single child with AIDS was on publicly financed antiretroviral therapy in Lesotho.“Every morning, I had to check on who is alive and who is not alive,” she recalled. “So many passed away. Most of those dying were under the age of 2. It went on for years. You see, in the ’90s we didn’t even have enough kits for H.I.V. testing.”Dr. Phiri, who spent every weekend on call for years, said the help from the corps doctors on the ward had lightened her load and improved care. She dreads their departure. “They have shared the weekends and covered me when I’m on holiday,” she said. “I’ve learned a lot from them.”More than 6,500 children in Lesotho, a country with a population of two million people and the world’s third-highest rate of H.I.V. infection, now receive the lifesaving medications. While that is progress, it is still only about a quarter of those in need of treatment, according to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS agency.Dr. Mphu Ramatlapeng, Lesotho’s minister of health, said the country could not have reached as many children without the corps.“These were serious professionals willing to dirty their hands,” she said.Dr. Young set off one recent morning for a village clinic he visits one day a month. He drove into the lush green mountains, past men draped in traditional blankets, through hamlets of mud huts crowned with conical thatched roofs, over crystalline streams flowing down from the peaks.“They know me here in the mountains,” he said.When he arrived at the clinic, families were already waiting on wooden benches to see him. Relebohile Mosehle, 27, an energetic nursing assistant he has trained, sat at his side in a small examination room. She lives at the clinic, which has neither running water nor electricity. She and a Kenyan nurse are the backbone of medical care in this area.Tsiu Lerotholi, 49, and his grandson Mojalefa, 9, had come that morning, having hiked through the mountains for another month’s supply of antiretroviral medicines. Mojalefa’s parents had died of AIDS — and he and his grandparents have the disease.The man and the boy took their almost empty bottles of pills from their backpacks. Dr. Young and Mrs. Mosehle quietly calculated, by how many were left, whether they were taking them properly. The pair’s adherence was nearly perfect.Mrs. Mosehle said the soft-spoken American doctor treated her like an equal and had taught her much. “He is a brother,” she said.But she did not yet know that his three-year stint in Lesotho would end in June. When told, she could not speak for some minutes, pressing her fingers to her eyes to hold back the tears.“We knew that he would go back home,” she said, “but our hearts are not ready.”'"
"'11-04-03,'0','Such a Darwinian ability to evolve grew out of the party’s near-death experience in 1989, when students and intellectuals occupied Tiananmen Square for seven weeks to demand free elections and an end to press restrictions, corruption and nepotism. In the years since it violently crushed those protests, the regime has found a way to satisfy many people much of the time — enough so that it has dissuaded most citizens from rolling the uncertain dice of pro-democracy street demonstrations.Until recently, China’s leadership also held out the promise of incremental political reform, although the recent Arab unrest, combined with preparations for a change in leadership next year, has effectively killed such prospects. Still, any way you run the numbers, life has undoubtedly improved for most Chinese. Over the past two decades, annual per capita urban incomes have more than tripled, to $3,100 a year; life expectancy has jumped by more than six years, to an average age of 75; and the ranks of illiterate adults have dropped by 46 million. Chinese cities, with their heady, mercantile buzz and acres of gleaming residential high-rises, embody the nation’s optimism. “Ten percent growth solves a lot of problems,” Professor O’Brien said.But economic growth alone does not explain the widespread aversion to political change one hears among intellectuals and professionals. For the country’s 70 million party members and the growing business class, the current arrangement delivers enormous advantages to those who play by the rules. The benefits can include low-interest loans from state banks and the forbearance of an all-powerful bureaucracy that could quash a company trying to start up outside the privileged club of state-owned behemoths.The current setup fosters allegiance to the party, even if it is based on the survival instinct and not a small dollop of greed. Li Fan, director of the World and China Institute, a nongovernmental group in Beijing that studies political reform, said electoral democracy would threaten the benefits entrepreneurial elites enjoy under the current system. “Those who have prospered from economic reform have no interest in sharing power or the spoils of prosperity with those beneath them,” he said.The same can be said of the 300 million members of China’s growing middle class, many of whom subscribe to the belief that universal suffrage would overempower their impoverished rural brethren. It has become an article of faith, even among idealistic college students, that Chinese peasants are too unschooled to intelligently select the nation’s leaders. As Jiang Zemin, then the Chinese president, told Mike Wallace in a 2000 interview, “The quality of our people is too low.”The demonization of democracy emanates from top leaders like Wu Bangguo, the party’s top legislator, who last month warned the nation that electoral democracy would drive China “into the abyss of internal disorder.” Chiming in are celebrities like Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong actor who has denounced democratic societies like Taiwan as “chaotic,” saying the Chinese require authoritarian governance. “If we’re not being controlled, we’ll just do what we want,” he said at a gathering of Chinese executives two years ago, prompting a round of hearty applause.Although most upwardly mobile Chinese are not eager to talk about it, there is another compelling disincentive against agitating for the kind of Western-style democracy they admit to admiring so much — when it is practiced in places like the United States. Liu Xiaobo, the last Chinese citizen of note to call for an end to single-party rule, found himself in jail for 11 years on charges of subversion. Even his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded last October, did nothing to ease his predicament, nor has it sapped the government’s zeal for repression: In recent weeks, more than four dozen public intellectuals, rights lawyers and bloggers have been detained or “disappeared” by the authorities as part of an ominous new campaign against dissent.“It is true that people have seen a significant improvement in living standards and they are optimistic about the future,” said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong. “But they also know there is nothing to be gained by sticking their neck out.”'"
"'11-04-03,'0','Researchers at HSBC, working with scholars at Oxford University, have used statistical techniques to document that correlations rose across asset classes in the years before the crisis and surged in response to shocks like the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Various events during the financial crisis triggered the birth of the risk-on, risk-off paradigm,” an HSBC paper declared last August. Risk and the market’s response to it are the main factors explaining the rising correlations, the researchers found.The implications are considerable, the report said: “In current market conditions, there is little point trying to understand the nuances between different asset classes, or the relative value within asset classes. Commodities behave like bonds, which behave like equities. They are no longer easily identifiable, uncorrelated trades.”Furthermore, Mr. Williams said, close correlation of seemingly disparate assets implies that many portfolios may not be as diversified as we may think.Other strategists have found similar patterns. UBS, the giant Swiss bank, for example, has developed its own Equity Risk Appetite Indicator, combining data from “credit, foreign exchange and equity markets,“ according to a recent report.The risk appetite of global investors has swung dramatically of late, said Christopher Ferrarone, a UBS global equity strategist based in Stamford, Conn. In response to “geopolitical events and disasters” — the turmoil in the Middle East, a flare-up of the debt crisis in Europe, as well as the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan — risk aversion leapt during much of March, he said. But the appetite for risk revived in the week of March 21, and surged again last week.The risk-on, risk-off mantra may help explain some other anomalies, said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and co-author of the book “Emerging Markets: Resilience and Growth Amid Global Turmoil.” While the economies of emerging-market nations have grown more independent, their financial markets have been tightly synchronized with those of more developed nations, he said in a telephone interview from Nanjing, China, where he participated in a seminar on the international monetary system.“Financial markets are supposed to be very helpful in diversifying risk, but the whole point is you want uncorrelated returns across markets,” he said. “If markets are more correlated now, it may be because people are trying to diversify by investing globally, but when there is a trigger event — when something nasty happens in the world — they sell assets across markets, and the usefulness of this entire diversification strategy must come into question.”In a heavily annotated March market letter, James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, scribbled “WOW” on a chart showing that correlations between commodity and stock prices had become “remarkably elevated.” Another chart showed similar links between those two asset classes and bonds.In an interview, Mr. Paulsen said that while the current synchronization of disparate markets “is of greater magnitude and has been going on longer than in any period I’ve seen,” there were precedents.“ ‘Risk on, risk off,’ it’s a new phrase,” he said, “but when you look back at, say, the period right after the ’87 stock market crash — that was risk on, risk off, baby. Risk was all anyone was thinking about.”At the moment, he said, markets are still grappling with the “total obliteration of economic confidence in this country and in the world during the financial crisis.” He said we’ve gone from confidence levels “we’ve never registered before to levels you’d normally see in a recession.” How long it will take for fear to subside fully, he added, is anyone’s guess.BUT Mr. Paulsen says he believes that an economic recovery is already well under way, and that the perception that this is a high-risk environment is mistaken. He advises a contrarian view: “People are already pricing things for a potential depression, so there’s a tremendous amount of protection in prices, and a tremendous upside,” he said. In fact, he added, it will be clear in hindsight that this was a time to embrace risk.Investors can find many bargains in risk assets like stocks, he said, because their prices are still modest relative to the strong corporate earnings in the United States and abroad. “The dysfunction in the market — the high correlations — all of that is offering investors an opportunity rather than something to avoid,” he said. “Eventually this will all go away and that will be kind of sad, because it will mean these opportunities will be over.”'"
"'11-04-03,'0','Despite its recent worries, Nokia remains the largest phone manufacturer in the world, and it has no equal in building handsets inexpensively. Last year, it sold more than 452 million phones, including 100 million smartphones.“The average price paid for smartphones is going to go down, and the total number of smartphones is going to go up,” says Andrew Lees, president of Microsoft’s mobile communications business.Microsoft introduced Windows Phone 7, a major overhaul, last fall. By year-end, Microsoft had 5,000 apps in its store, a milestone reached three times as fast as Google’s Android, says Al Hilwa, an IDC analyst.Mr. Lees says that there are now more than 11,500 apps. It’s not close to the more than 350,000 apps that Apple boasts for iOS. But the difference may not be significant.“What is often missed is the diminishing returns after 1,000 applications,” says Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “If a platform attracts the thousand-most-popular apps, then it provides almost anything a reasonable person would want to do with a smartphone.”I sought out iPhone software developers who have done well with iPhone apps to see what they make of Windows Phone. I was surprised that many are already adding titles for Windows Phone, despite the tiny market share.“Microsoft has a perception problem. Everyone thinks of them as a distant third, but they’ve got a good product,” says David Roberts, chief executive of PopCap, a games developer whose Plants vs. Zombies game is among the iPhone’s top-grossing apps. The company just introduced its first Windows Phone game, Bejeweled Live.Halfbrick, based in Brisbane, Australia, is another successful iPhone software developer. Last week, its Fruit Ninja game was No. 5 in the App Store’s list of top paid apps. It, too, has introduced its first title for Windows Phone.Shainiel Deo, Halfbrick’s C.E.O., says that while games were not a major attraction on past Microsoft phones, games will be a differentiator that will favor Microsoft this time. For example, the Marketplace store of Windows Phone employs the same user accounts used for Xbox Live.Mr. Deo says he, too, is susceptible to iPhone-centrism. “In Australia, almost everyone I see has an iPhone,” he said. But “the next phone for a lot of the Xbox gamers will probably be a Windows Phone,” he remarked. “And there are 30 million Xbox Live subscribers.”Jeffrey R. Williams, a professor of business strategy at Carnegie Mellon, predicts that Microsoft will become a major player in mobile devices for one overriding reason: “They’re willing to spend billions of dollars, just as they did with Xbox,” he says. “And this is even more strategic.”There is also little need to focus on tight integration with Microsoft Office, a keystone of the company’s marketing campaigns for its earlier phones. The Office integration pitch was aimed at corporate I.T. departments, which also made the purchasing decisions that shaped the personal computer industry.The world has changed since then, Professor Eisenmann points out. “In PCs, it was business leading consumers.” he said. “This is a different game: consumers leading business.”SMARTPHONES are a different case for another reason. In the industry’s formative period, Windows and Macs didn’t mix well on the same network, but different brands of smartphones share the same voice and data networks just fine. “I don’t think the network effects in smartphones are as strong,” Professor Williams says.Nokia is in Microsoft’s camp. Good reviews of the software are coming in. Some leading iPhone developers are taking it seriously, and the company has plenty of capital to help it form alliances. Unexpectedly, Microsoft is well positioned to leap into the top ranks of smartphone players. A story to hearten latecomers everywhere.'"
"'11-04-03,'0','LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Republican National Committee has asked the party’s likely presidential candidates if they would be willing to participate in debates in which it picked the format, the content and even the moderators in exchange for their help digging the party out of its $21 million debt.In a letter, two committee officials proposed seven debates that would essentially give the party’s stamp of approval to monthly meetings from August to February. The process would give the candidates an excuse to skip any potentially hostile debates.In the 2008 election cycle, the sizable number of debates and forums prompted many of the candidates to adopt a similar strategy.“We think we all agree the objective of the R.N.C.-sanctioned debates would be to provide a fair and impartial forum for the Republican candidates to educate and inform voters about their candidates in a series of candidate forums which are party and grassroots-driven rather than media driven,” James Bopp, a committee member, and Jeff Larson, the committee’s chief of staff, wrote in a one-page memorandum that was released on Friday.In exchange for reducing the power of news organizations, which traditionally sponsor primary debates, to select the moderator, the candidates would have to contribute toward paying down the sizeable debt left behind by the former committee chairman, Michael Steele. Although Republicans made great gains in November’s midterm elections, the debt leaves the central party at a disadvantage heading into the 2012 presidential race.The Republican National Committee, which traditionally hands a national campaign over to its eventual presidential nominee, is trying to erase the debt before the party chooses a challenger to President Obama. Republican fund-raisers have considered other options; one member even suggested selling broadcast rights to the debates.'"
"'11-04-03,'0','Now, two and a half years later, no dirt has been moved at Punta Brava and Mr. Woods has not visited in some time. His two other designs, in Dubai and near Asheville, N.C., are also troubled; the Dubai course, according to people familiar with the project, has been shelved permanently. The desert sands have started to reclaim the strips of green from the six holes that have been completed. The Asheville project is searching for new financing, and construction has halted until at least this summer. In the nearly five years since Tiger Woods Design was founded, none of the courses have been completed.It’s a trajectory that mirrors just about every element of Mr. Woods’s life these days: As he enters the Masters tournament beginning on Thursday, his golf game has fallen apart and he is overhauling his swing for the fourth time in his career. The string of affairs that made him tabloid fodder in 2009 and 2010 cost him his marriage, custody of his two young children and the loss of endorsement deals with Accenture, AT&T and Gatorade.Brian Tucker, the founder and developer of Punta Brava, said the delay there had nothing to do with Mr. Woods’s personal scandal. His group had to redo the environmental impact study, he said, and groundbreaking is set for later this year. What remains to be seen is how much the developers will use Mr. Woods’s image to sell the course. Mr. Tucker suggested that Punta Brava would be marketed mostly on its exotic locale.“This project is not about Tiger Woods,” Mr. Tucker said last month, emphasizing that the course is surrounded on three sides by the ocean and has 12 holes requiring a player to hit the ball over water.Punta Brava’s location allows it to play down Mr. Woods’s involvement, but the two other courses he designed do not have this luxury. His allure as one of the world’s great champions was a crucial pillar of the sales plan.Bryon Bell, president of Tiger Wood Design, said the firm would not be looking for new partners in Dubai. “As the course designer, it is not our role to secure financing for the projects,” he wrote in an e-mail.When asked about the Asheville project, he said: “Our role beyond design work can vary depending on the client. Some request additional promotional or marketing opportunities, others just ask for our patience during these economic times.”For now, the only golf project that Tiger Woods Design has completed is behind Mr. Woods’s newly finished mansion on Jupiter Island, Fla. With four greens, seven sand traps and different cuts of grass, the 3.5-acre pitch-and-putt course would delight any golfer.While Mr. Woods could surprise the golf world and win this week at the Masters, it will take more than a major championship to rehabilitate his business career. And that raises some questions: What will become of the two remaining courses that bear his name, and can Tiger Woods Design re-emerge as a viable enterprise?WHEN Tiger Woods started his golf design business in 2006, few doubted that he could deliver a course that everyone would want to play. That confidence didn’t vanish when the global economy began to fracture in 2008. Real estate values — so vital to any golf development — were dropping but were not yet considered at crisis levels. There were signs of a financial reckoning on the horizon, but not in the world inhabited by millionaire investors looking for a spot in golf’s most exclusive clubs. The Tiger market remained bullish.Investors had compelling reasons to hope that Mr. Woods was recession-proof. Dubai had ponied up an estimated $55 million, according to widely circulated reports, for the privilege of owning Mr. Woods’s first-ever course design. The Asheville project, at a gated community called the Cliffs at High Carolina, had reportedly paid him $10 million. The usual fee for course design by a top architect runs $2 million to $3 million.It didn’t matter that Mr. Woods had never designed a course. Who more than Tiger Woods knew his way around bentgrass and bunkers? With his practical experience, he would learn the details of the business on the job.And so he set about to do so. “The amount of meetings I’ve been in — people would be shocked,” he said in an interview in 2008. “But that’s how you gain experience, how you can gain knowledge, being in meetings and participating. You learn and grow.”In the beginning, Mr. Woods was hands-on. To the delight of his backers, he visited the sites often. He reworked the layout of the courses until they met his standards. At Punta Brava, he made 27 routing maps, when most top architects do three or four. At High Carolina, he changed the layout so that that the ninth hole would not be northern-facing and unplayable in the winter.He also made time for the publicity events that were part of the deal. He traveled to Dubai in December 2006 to announce that his first course design would be built in the desert, surrounded by mansions costing tens of millions of dollars. In 2007, he strolled into a packed room at one of the Cliffs’ other communities, in South Carolina, to unveil his plans for High Carolina, his first course in the United States.A year later, after his victory at Torrey Pines, he made his trip to Punta Brava to approve the final layout.Actions like this only burnished his image with investors: he was a great golfer, and also a man of his word. What was selling these projects, of course, was Tiger Woods the champion, not Tiger Woods the course designer. Jack Nicklaus, who has operated a successful design business since 1969, was one of the few who added a sobering voice when asked about Mr. Woods’s precociousness in course design: “Yes, but he hasn’t done any yet,” Mr. Nicklaus said soon after the Cliffs broke ground. “He’s on his third golf-course contract.”His comment proved prescient, though no one wanted to hear it any more than they wanted to hear that housing prices wouldn’t always go up. Mr. Woods’s aura was evident at the gala in Beverly Hills that officially announced Punta Brava. In a scene more like a film premiere, Mr. Woods met with hundreds of the world’s wealthiest golfers, many of whom had made their money through shrewd business dealings.“I introduced him to every single person that night, 250 people,” said Brady Oman, who was then part of the development group but has since left. “It went past midnight. He stayed way past the end.”The prospect of working with Mr. Woods caused even the savviest among them to drop their normal skepticism. At the unveiling of the project in 2008, Red McCombs, the major financial backer of Punta Brava, said that initially, “I wasn’t turned on by the whole thing. Then they said, ‘I think we can get Tiger involved in designing this.’ I said, ‘Forget it, it’s over, I’m in.’ ”Mr. McCombs, a lifelong real estate investor, added: “It was the idea of Tiger coming in as a partner and designing the course, not just in name but in total involvement in the course. He has such an impeccable background and he added to the property.”Now, two and a half years later, with the business seemingly stymied, it is hard to sort out all the contributing factors. The economic crisis was certainly one of them. Credit dried up, and real estate prices plunged. It was a bad time for any development, and the golf industry suffered. According to the National Golf Foundation, only 46 new courses opened in the United States in 2010, the fewest in 25 years.There is evidence, too, that all three developments significantly overestimated the prices they could charge for surrounding real estate, with lavish mansions in Dubai and homes at Punta Brava priced as high as $12 million.The tarnishing of Mr. Woods’s image has presumably hurt as well. Its impact is harder to quantify, though it probably has been more of a factor for the Cliffs, which based its initial sales pitch as much on Mr. Woods’s personality and reputation as on his athletic accomplishments. Jim Anthony, the project’s founder, does not even play golf. He likes to fish and take long walks with his pedometer ticking off the miles. His vision of the Cliffs was to sell the communities based on a lifestyle of health and wellness and a family-friendly image.So when the string of affairs that ended Mr. Woods’s marriage was revealed, the Cliffs had to scramble; now, the marketing is affected by the fact that the company doesn’t want to plaster Mr. Woods’s image over all of its promotional materials.Mr. Anthony said he harbored no animosity toward Mr. Woods. “I don’t know of any of us who hasn’t made a mistake,” he said. “I had some conversations with Tiger when he was here. I think he’s genuinely working hard.”He said he does not blame Mr. Woods’s travails for the sluggish sales at High Carolina. “I think it’s very minimally Tiger,” he said.Regardless, Mr. Woods’s work with these projects is largely done. He has been paid the bulk of his contract fees. “Traditionally, a course designer’s job begins and ends with designing a great course,” said Mr. Bell, the head of the company.In the meantime, there have not been any new projects announced by Tiger Woods Design. “We are evaluating opportunities from all over the world,” Mr. Bell said. “We’re staying focused on our original mission of finding great sites, great partners, and creating spectacular designs. I’m very confident about our future.”FOR the investors who backed Tiger Woods’s designs, time is running short, or has run out altogether. The Dubai project appears all but dead. Mr. Woods’s Web site says completion of the course is pending and that he might revive it. But an official at Golf in Dubai, which promotes the sport in the emirate said the project was “as good as dead and buried.” He said the chief executive had left and that the second in command was back in Canada.“Basically it was an exorbitant project,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid contradicting his organization’s role. “The $100 million mansions were too expensive even during the years of real estate boom in Dubai.”Punta Brava, the hardest-to-reach of Mr. Woods’s courses, is the one in the best financial position. It, too, started with grand plans of 8,000-square-foot mansions and a gigantic clubhouse.But as the economy cratered, the developers found themselves battling local groups over the environmental impact study it had submitted. Even after they redid the study, they faced hurdles to getting the proper permits to build along the Pacific.Mr. Tucker, the founder, said this delay, however frustrating, turned out to be a blessing. He was able to go back to prospective buyers who had toured the site and ask if they were still interested.“We said, ‘Let’s talk about prices.’ Before, we were looking at the $3 million-$12 million ranges; now based on all of this we’re looking at $800,000 to $3.9 million,” he said. “We took advantage of a difficult, stressful, frustrating situation that allowed us to refine the land plan for Punta Brava and give not what the market wants but what our people want.”The project has also benefited from financial backing from Mr. McCombs and Ruben Gonzalez Pena, a businessman in the Baja area, so it has not had to rely on bank financing. They have also appealed to a crowd of wealthy golf purists who have access to the private jets they will need to land at the local airport. (The club provides members helicopter transportation from the airport to their homes — that is, if they don’t have their own helicopter.)AS for the Cliffs, it seems to be caught between success and failure. It seemed to be the safest choice — a string of seven golf communities with a proven record of success. But its ability to pay for the course, and its constant operation, was contingent on the ability to sell homes.After the groundbreaking in November 2008, with Mr. Woods attending in specially designed Nike clothing, the Cliffs said that it had sold 40 lots at High Carolina, starting at $500,000. That number has not changed since then.After struggling through 2009, the Cliffs realized that it needed financial help. It borrowed $64 million from a group of residents in April 2010, and, in January this year, a Dallas-based property developer made an investment to help restructure its debt. Mr. Anthony said that this helped reduce the debt burden by $50 million, and that he continues to work with other lenders.“We make no bones about it: cash flow is still tough,” he said. “We feel fortunate that our property owners are supporting us.”Don Tucker, a lawyer who serves on the advisory board for the group that lent the club $64 million, said his group had recommended that work be halted on the Tiger Woods course — and that other improvements at the Cliffs be postponed — so it could first finish the development’s seventh course, one designed by Gary Player.But this has created a chicken-or-egg scenario: Mr. Woods’s course can’t be completed until more homes are sold, but buyers won’t commit until the course is finished.“That’s the conundrum for every golf course designer,” Mr. Tucker said.Mr. Anthony, who began his career as a telephone lineman, remains optimistic. He noted that Southwest Airlines is going to start flying into Asheville, which he hopes will help with sales.In many ways, living on a Tiger Woods course was always based more on allure than financial calculation — the seductive combination of natural beauty, exclusivity and Mr. Woods’s platinum image. “I want to get to know them, and they should get to know me,” Mr. Woods said in the 2008 interview, of the people he would work with. “It’s not just going out there and designing golf courses. I consider it a partnership. We’re in this together through thick and thin.”While Mr. Woods’s early forays into course design have stumbled — and have definitely come at great cost to the projects’ financial backers — no one is accusing him of doing his job poorly or failing to keep his commitments. Like his golf game, the business is simply stuck, beyond even his power to lift it up, bend it to his will and defy natural forces the way so many of his superhuman golf shots did when he sent them soaring.Still, it seems likely that Mr. Woods will get the opportunity to build other courses in the future. At some point, his personal scandal will have faded, the real estate market may pick up and he could even start winning golf tournaments again.Until then, Mr. Woods at least has the practice course in his backyard. That is more than his partners can say.'"
"'11-04-03,'0','According to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, there have been 56 arrests for some kind of theft over the past three years at four of the most upscale sports clubs in Manhattan; of those arrested, 17 had no prior criminal records. That, law enforcement officials say, suggests that about one-third of gym crimes were inside jobs committed by fitness club members.“Some people just like to steal for the thrill of it,” said John Ryan, the chief assistant district attorney of Queens, bringing to mind kleptomaniac Hollywood starlets who pocket designer clothes. “They don’t do it for the money, but for the thrill of getting away with it.”Scott Rosen, the chief operating officer of Equinox, said in an interview that the staff members at his clubs were trained to be vigilant spotters of sticky-fingered athletes and other petty thieves. Just in case, he said, Equinox was adding more security cameras in its 51 fitness centers across the country (including 18 in New York) — though not in locker rooms, where Equinox says it is illegal to film gymgoers, toned or otherwise, in various states of undress.Then last week, I got an e-mail from Equinox warning me to be on high alert after a recent spate of locker-room thefts at health clubs across New York. A spokeswoman explained, when I inquired, that the note routinely went out to all new male members, but not to women, because “almost all known gym thieves are male.”None of which helped me that day in the locker room. I ran around, opening every cubby in search of my jeans, as onlookers — including, I was certain, the wily pants fancier   — gawked at the frantic man in Calvin Klein boxer briefs. I burrowed fruitlessly in the eucalyptus-scented towel fridge, but the jeans weren’t there, either.  Defeated, I put on my long, dark blue wool coat over my gym shorts and rushed into the bone-chilling, 37-degree New York night looking like a deranged flasher.After braving more than a few looks, I arrived panting at my apartment and rang my new super’s bell to get a replacement key and to call the police. He opened the door a few inches and stared at me with barely concealed horror. “Sorry, you can’t use our phone,” he said. He pushed his two young daughters farther inside the apartment, then slammed the door in my face.“Welcome to New York,” my neighbor said when I told him about my ordeal. Colleagues stared at me with “I told you so” incredulity, insinuating ever so delicately that if, as I admitted was ever-so-remotely possible, I had accidentally left the jeans on a bench in a New York gym, however upscale, it was equivalent to leaving your BMW convertible purring outside a crack den.  In other words, I had it coming.After filing a police report, along with other traumatized victims, including an Australian tourist who had his phone swiped in Times Square, I joined Equinox anyway, paying $178 a month for access to any of its gyms, and I have been back three or four times each week. Now, like a seasoned New Yorker, I make sure to lock my locker, and tug several times at the lock to make sure it’s closed. I also can’t help scouring the gym in search of some investment banker wearing my favorite jeans.'"

"'11-04-03,'0','IN just a few days, Mark Chatterley will drive from his home in Williamston, Mich., to the Clay Art Center in Port Chester, his black Ford extension van filled with larger-than-life ceramic human forms packed, he said, “like cordwood.” Upon his arrival, Mr. Chatterley, an award-winning sculptor who has exhibited nationally and internationally, will arrange those pieces, along with some smaller wall works, in the center’s gallery, where his solo exhibition, “Mark Chatterley: Clay Dreams,” is set to open on Saturday.The contrast between the pockmarked, concretelike surfaces of the larger figures, some of which are nearly nine feet high, and their elegant, contemplative poses defines a body of work that, Mr. Chatterley said, “combines creation and destruction, the beautiful and the malformed, with everything in flux.”In “Dirty Dancing,” for instance, an elongated, craggy couple embrace in a graceful sway. In “Building Blocks,” three women rest simultaneously against and atop one another. In “Human Column,” five stacked seated figures, each leaning forward, form an interplay of triangles, elbows on knees, buttocks on backs.It was the surface textures of Mr. Chatterley’s works that struck Leigh Taylor Mickelson, the Clay Art Center’s program director, when she first saw them at the Chicago International Exposition of Sculpture Objects and Functional Art, known as SOFA, in 2008. “I remember thinking, ‘Is this ceramics?’ ” she said. “They looked like they were carved out of some otherworldly medium.”In fact, Mr. Chatterley, 53, whose pieces will be part of SOFA New York in April, uses slabs of clay, shaping his hollow structures from the bottom up. “I work on a dozen pieces at a time,” he said, “maybe eight inches a day on each one.”Most of his figures are women (“I like the female form,” he said); all are naked and bald (“I don’t want them to be dated with hair or clothes”). He said he worked from sketches rather than models, adding, “I’m not interested in making realistic forms.”'"
"'11-04-03,'0','Still, this final testament probably isn’t the best place to begin with this gifted director, who has been too frequently overwhelmed by the image he created for himself. As Scott Eyman writes in “Empire of Dreams” (Simon & Schuster), a fascinating new biography of DeMille, he was a major form giver of the silent era who worked long enough to see his style eclipsed by later developments.Despite the 44 days that he and his company spent in the deserts of Egypt “The Ten Commandments” remains largely a studio-bound film at a time when Hollywood was moving toward location shooting as a way of achieving greater realism (and as a way of appeasing the gods of widescreen and color, which could make the studio sets, no matter how beautifully designed and lighted, look fake).A new kind of performance style was afoot in the land as well. In the context of the work that Method acolytes like James Dean and Marlon Brando were doing at the time, “The Ten Commandments” can look like a Museum of Jurassic Acting, with performers locked into wooden poses declaiming their lines to the last row of the balcony. Instinctively DeMille was preserving the turn-of-the-century acting style in which he had literally been raised. (His father was a playwright who frequently worked with David Belasco, the leading theatrical impresario of his day.) Heston’s Moses may seem stiff and bombastic today, but to DeMille those qualities represented stature and authority, a man who was not like other men.Except, of course, when he was. At its dramatic heart “The Ten Commandments” is less a story of religious belief or national awakening than a barn-burning melodrama, constructed along the same lines as DeMille’s secular films of the ’20s. It is the timeless story of two men in love with the same woman.In the silent “Ten Commandments,” the biblical scenes serve as a 50-minute prologue to a modern story, in which two brothers, one righteous and pious (Richard Dix), the other venal and charming (Rod La Rocque) compete for the affections of a poor young woman (Leatrice Joy) whom their religious mother has rescued from the streets.The 1956 film essentially incorporates this plot — with further complications — into the biblical tale. As much as DeMille and his screenwriters claimed authority for their extra-scriptural interpolations in the Midrash (rabbinical commentaries on Scripture) and the histories of Josephus and Eusebius, their inspiration undoubtedly lies in DeMille’s impeccable audience-pleasing instincts: the righteous brother becomes Heston’s Moses, the slippery one Rameses II (Yul Brynner) and the woman in dispute Nefretiri, the Throne Princess (Anne Baxter).DeMille, for whom the complications of modern marriage were always Topic A, uses the sexually charged conflict of these scenes to link the movie’s major set pieces, which regain a measure of their original VistaVision grandeur in the new Blu-ray edition. The parting of the Red Sea is justly famous as the costliest, most complex special-effects sequence attempted up to its time; more impressive artistically, perhaps, is the 10th plague, in which the Angel of Death is imagined as a thick, green mist that creeps through the streets of the royal city, claiming the lives of Egypt’s firstborn sons.If DeMille’s direction of individual actors often seems quaint in “The Ten Commandments,” his epic choreography of his fabled thousands of extras remains dazzling. In the Exodus sequence each tiny figure seems to have been individually positioned, to maximize effects of color and contrast. And these are not static images, but whirlpools of movement, every square inch of the screen filled with a constant buzz of coordinated activity.Digital processes have made it cheaper and easier to assemble such multitudes in films like “Gladiator” and “300,” but pixels are pixels, no matter how artfully deployed. Only DeMille and his army of assistants could have captured the spectacle of “The Ten Commandments,” a human spectacle, with weight, warmth and life.

"'11-04-03,'0','“Please Look After Mom,” by the South Korean writer Kyung-sook Shin, opens with a family in disarray. Mom is missing, separated from Father by the closing doors of a subway car in a busy train station in Seoul. A day, a week, then nearly a month goes by. Mom’s husband and adult children are not only worried, but crippled with guilt and regret, fumbling “in confusion, as if they had all injured a part of their brains.” Are you punishing me? each privately wonders.The eldest daughter, Chi-hon, is the writer of her family, and she is persuaded to draft the missing-person fliers. “Appearance: Short, salt-and-pepper permed hair, prominent cheekbones,” she writes, “last seen wearing a sky-blue shirt, a white jacket and a beige pleated skirt.” When Chi-hon thinks back on the Mom of her childhood, she sees a woman who “strode through the sea of people in a way that would intimidate even the authoritative buildings looking on from above.” The strangers who respond to her ads paint a different picture: “They saw an old woman walking very slowly, sometimes sitting . . . or standing vacantly.” Could it be the same woman?Shin’s novel, her first to be translated into English, embraces multiplicity. It is told from the perspectives of four members of the family, and from their memories emerges a portrait of a heroically selfless and industrious woman. She runs their rural home “like a factory.” She sews and knits and tills the fields, and raises puppies, piglets, ducklings and chickens. The family is poor, but she sees to it that her children’s bellies are filled, their tuition fees paid.Only after her children grow up and leave their home in Chongup does Mom’s strength and purposefulness begin to flag. When Chi-hon visits unannounced, she finds the house in shambles and Mom suffering private anguish. The daughter is stunned: “Mom got headaches? So severe that she couldn’t even cry?” These are some of the many questions that punctuate her narrative and lead to a cascade of revelations. Mom’s debilitating headaches are the byproduct of a stroke she told no one about. Other discoveries come gradually. After one of Chi-hon’s older brothers leaves the village for Seoul, she is responsible for writing letters to him, dictated by Mom. For years, Chi-hon assumes this is just an additional chore. The reality is revealed in another question she asks of herself: “When was it you realized that Mom didn’t know how to read?”Shin’s prose, intimate and hauntingly spare in this translation by Chi-Young Kim, moves from first to second and third person, and powerfully conveys grief’s bewildering immediacy. Chi-hon’s voice is the novel’s most distinct, but Father’s is the most devastating. Returning to the house in Chongup, he is “bludgeoned” with Mom’s absence as he realizes that he never fully appreciated her, this “steadfast tree” at the center of his life — and that all this time he had been in denial over her health’s deterioration.“The word ‘Mom’ is familiar,” Chi-hon observes, “and it hides a plea: Please look after me.” Passages of the novel may cause the grown children among Shin’s readers to cringe. (“You were the one who always hung up first,” Chi-hon mournfully remembers of her own behavior. “You would say, ‘Mom, I’ll call you back,’ and then you didn’t.”) And yet this book isn’t as interested in emotional manipulation as it is in the invisible chasms that open up between people who know one another best. Who is the missing woman? In this raw tribute to the mysteries of motherhood, only Mom knows.'"
"'11-04-03,'0','The signature quality of a Les Murray poem is anger — a visceral smoldering that freshly lights up the tired old landscape and turns conventional pieties inside out. A lifelong outsider and champion of the underdog, Murray grew up among impoverished farmers in rural Australia, where, as an overweight “redneck” teenager, he was mercilessly tormented at school. Today he is the closest thing Australia has to a national poet. A sui generis autodidact (he now suspects he has Asperger’s syndrome) equipped with a fierce moral vision and a sensuous musicality, he writes subtly about post­colonialism, urban sprawl and poverty and, in his most intimate poems, reminds us of the power of literature to transubstantiate grievance into insight. (His admirers have argued he ought to be considered for a Nobel.) But he is equally capable of writing emotionally simplistic and strangely soured poems in which the enraged adolescent emerges all but unmediated. This mercurial doubleness can make his work hard to categorize or describe: this is a mind at once revolutionary and reactionary. Or maybe just a poet who’s willing to show more id than most.Now comes a book that offers a powerfully candid view of Murray’s struggles with depression — one that will speak even to readers unfamiliar with his work. “Killing the Black Dog: A Memoir of Depression” is an unusual book. One half is a prose memoir (first written as a 1997 lecture, with an afterword composed in 2009) about his long struggle with serious depression. The second half comprises what Murray calls the “Black Dog” poems (the phrase is Churchill’s term for depression, and has a long history) — 24 poems written over the course of his life that deal squarely either with his depression or with the subterranean anger that he believes led to it. It’s a pungent, forthright primer in what depression can look like — and surely will make many suffering from the disease feel less alone with it. It also lifts the curtain on the stagecraft of poetry and offers a fascinating behind-the-scenes tour, elucidating just what the special abilities of poetry are.Murray was at the height of his career when he “went acute.” In 1985, he returned to the New South Wales farming valley where he’d grown up to care for his ailing father. “What I didn’t know was that I was heading home in order to go mad,” he writes. Two years later, approaching 50, he fell into a deep depression, occasioned, he believes, by the chance comment of an old high school tormenter who came to a local reading given by Murray and who “cheerfully recalled to me one of the nicknames she had bestowed on me 30-odd years previously.” (Murray had experienced a less severe depressive episode at the end of the 1950s.) Within days, his fingers started tingling painfully, and he later developed a sudden aversion to nicotine. He landed in an emergency room with what turned out to be a panic attack. A doctor sent him to the psychiatric ward, where his depression was diagnosed.Like most depressives, Murray entered a kind of living purgatory, captured well in this evocative if at times overly simplified account. For years he had panic attacks three to four times a day. His thoughts were “shredded mental kelp marinaded in pure pain.” He spent whole mornings “raising the energy to walk to the next room for a book.” He cut back on writing prose and says that many of his poems during this time were “knotted” and “unclear.” He suffered regularly from “the 4 a.m. Show” in which you find “your troubles and terrors ripping into you with a gusto allowed them by fatigue and the disappearance of proportion.” Xanax took the edge off, but no other drugs worked. “What did help were work, family, routine and talks with other sufferers.” So, funnily enough, did the character Hannibal Lecter in “The Silence of the Lambs,” who reminded Murray that “for self-examination to work, you must tell the exact truth, suppressing nothing.” Murray endeavors to do just what Lecter commands, confronting his past and his own shortcomings without special pleading — for example, revealing that having been flogged by his angry, frustrated father he in turn flogged his own children until one day he felt a “sudden revulsion” and stopped.Depression is hardly the hidden illness it was some 20 years ago when William Styron wrote “Darkness Visible,” his now classic account, and a reader might well ask, Why add to the heap of stories? After all, one of the most challenging aspects of depression is the way it resists narrative — evading our attempts to “make sense” of its predations. But “Killing the Black Dog” raises powerful questions that are usually theoretical. Is art useful? In Murray’s view it has literally helped save his life. The discovery of both God and poetry in his teens, he tells us, kept him from becoming a darker version of himself, the sort of raging lad who might have tormented animals or, as he puts it in the moving poem “A Torturer’s Apprenticeship”: “But for the blood-starred barefoot spoor / he found, this one might have made dark news.” Here we see the difference between the frontal approach of his prose — with its power to connect — and the memorable sidling-up of his poetry, which haunts and upsets, like a thorn.'"

"'11-04-04,'1','Mandi Schwartz, the Yale player who confronted her leukemia with support from hockey fans from Connecticut to western Canada, died Sunday in Regina, Saskatchewan. She was 23. Her death was confirmed by the university.Schwartz learned in December 2008 that she had acute myeloid leukemia, and her teammates organized drives to find a bone-marrow donor on the Yale campus and across North America. In January 2010, she regained enough strength to return to practice, but in April her cancer returned. She had a stem-cell transplant in September, but in December, a biopsy showed that her cancer had returned.Schwartz’s brother Jaden was a first-round draft pick of the St. Louis Blues last year and played for Canada in the world junior championships.When her cancer was in remission, she had grown healthy enough that she was able to help coach a girls youth hockey team in the Seattle area, where she had her transplant, and even return to the ice to skate with them in December.But only days after she returned to the ice for the first time since her transplant, a biopsy showed that her cancer had returned. Schwartz returned to her native Saskatchewan shortly thereafter. She is survived by her parents, Rick and Carol Schwartz, and two brothers, Jaden and Rylan, a sophomore center for Colorado College.'"
"'11-04-04,'1','¶The United States Army decided after a required review to keep the McCann Worldgroup, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as its lead advertising agency. The account, with annual spending estimated at $184 million to $200 million, has been handled by the McCann Worldgroup since 2005. The Army awarded the McCann Worldgroup a new one-year contract, to begin on Thursday, with four one-year option periods, for a maximum of five years. Eleven agencies work on the account, including units of the McCann Worldgroup like McCann Erickson Worldwide and MRM Worldwide; other Interpublic agencies like Weber Shandwick; and independent agencies like Carol H. Williams Advertising.¶Ally Financial, Detroit, consolidated its account, previously handled by 10 to 15 agencies, and awarded it to Grey New York, part of the Grey unit of the Grey Group, a division of WPP. The assignment, with spending for 2011 estimated at $200 million, includes Ally Bank as well as automotive finance and mortgage operations. The Ally Bank creative assignment had been handled by the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Grey New York described the account win as its largest in five years. The G2 unit of the Grey Group will also work on the account.¶Office Depot, Boca Raton, Fla., named Zimmerman Advertising, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., part of the Omnicom Group, to handle its account, which had been led by Y&R New York, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of WPP, since September 2008. Spending was estimated at $60 million.¶International Dairy Queen, Edina, Minn., part of Berkshire Hathaway, selected Spark Communications, Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe, to handle its media planning and buying. The account, with spending estimated at $100 million, had been handled by MediaCom, New York, part of the GroupM unit of WPP.¶Jean-Yves Naouri, chief operating officer at the Publicis Groupe, Paris, will also serve in a new post, executive chairman of the company’s flagship agency, Publicis Worldwide. The change is being made after Richard Pinder, chief operating officer at Publicis Worldwide, said he would leave to “turn to fresh challenges,” according to the agency.¶Stephanie Nerlich joined Grey Canada, Toronto, as president and chief executive. She succeeds Ann Nurock, who “has decided to leave the agency,” Grey Canada said, for opportunities outside advertising in Canada.

"'11-04-04,'1','Life after Haiti’s earthquake has been especially difficult and dangerous for displaced women and girls. In addition to the ongoing crises of homelessness and cholera, a chronic emergency of sexual violence prevails in the settlements where hundreds of thousands still live, well over a year after the disaster.Groups of Haitian women have been struggling to defend themselves, banding together to prevent assaults and now taking their case to a wider world. At a hearing March 25 in Washington before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a grass-roots group, Kofaviv, joined other human-rights advocates in pressing for an end to what they called a rape epidemic. The police, they said, rarely patrol inside unlighted camps or investigate attacks. Victims live in constant fear and shame while attackers go unpunished.Their evidence, compiled in a wrenching petition delivered to the commission last fall, led the commission to demand urgent action by Haiti to protect its women and girls. The Haitian government, beset by political and other crises, has failed to do its job. But others, including the United Nations, the United States and other international donors and aid agencies, can and must do more.The camps need more police and better lighting. Community groups need training and resources to protect victims and identify predators. Women’s groups must be drawn fully into relief and reconstruction planning.While the world’s attention has turned elsewhere, Haiti’s misery remains. The U.N. reported in March that contributions to its ongoing emergency appeal are lagging and funds are running out for even such basics as clean-water delivery and sewage removal. This month’s meeting of Haiti’s recovery commission and the selection of a new president may begin to put the recovery back on track. Women and girls in Haiti’s camps must not be forced to live in constant fear.'"
"'11-04-04,'1','While Butler is often cast as a scrappy bunch of overachievers, Mack been one of the most dominating players in this N.C.A.A. tournament. He has averaged 21.8 points a game, lighting up top-seeded Pittsburgh for 30 points.If Mack were to enter the N.B.A. draft after this season, he would probably be a fringe first-round pick. His stock has risen during the tournament. He has showcased 3-point range, a polished midrange game and craftiness in driving to the basket. He also made the biggest play of Butler’s victory over Virginia Commonwealth in the national semifinal, a skip pass to Shawn Vanzant for a 3-pointer from the corner that pushed the Butler lead to 7 points with about three minutes remaining.V.C.U. Coach Shaka Smart called Mack a “killer,” one of the highest basketball compliments.“Some of the guys from UConn and Kentucky, they talk about their pro projections and all that stuff,” Smart said. “I’m not an N.B.A. guy. I don’t know how all that works. But I would take Shelvin Mack on my team just as quickly as I would take any of the other guards that played in this tournament.”Mack has the talent to be playing in a more glamorous conference. He chose Butler over higher-profile programs like Miami of the Atlantic Coast Conference and stuck with his commitment when Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi State and Georgia from the Southeastern Conference made late overtures.Resisting Kentucky was especially tough; Mack grew up as a Wildcats fan. But Mack has been loyal his whole life. When Bryan Station High School tried to fire its coach, Champ Ligon, before Mack’s senior year, he said he would transfer if that happened. He helped organize a petition to keep Ligon, and the school listened.Mack says he has no regrets coming to Butler. “It’s been one of the best decisions of my life to come to Butler University,” Mack said.Brandon Miller, a former Butler assistant who was the lead recruiter for Mack, said Mack recognized what Butler had been building.“With Kentucky being in there and Shelvin being from Lexington, I think it speaks volumes of Shelvin seeing the vision of where Butler was headed,” Miller said.Oreese Ivery, one of Mack’s youth and assistant high school coaches, said Kentucky initially thought Mack was not quick enough to run the point and did not shoot the ball well enough to play shooting guard. Billy Gillispie, then the Kentucky coach, came in late with an offer, but Mack stuck to Butler.Ivery said he was not surprised. “It’s been a beautiful marriage,” he said of Mack and Butler.Like any marriage, it takes work. Mack’s body did not exactly make Greek statues jealous when he arrived at Butler. The associate head coach Matthew Graves said that Mack had always had a great work ethic, but not the best diet.“Our guys joked to him about how many times he eats at McDonald’s and Buffalo Wild Wings,” Graves said.Mack has improved, with his experience playing against Team USA last summer in Las Vegas giving him exposure to how N.B.A. players take care of their bodies. Mack said his conditioning had improved more than any other part of his game at Butler.He has also worked hard with the team trainer, Ryan Galloy, to eliminate cramping, which has bedeviled Mack throughout his Butler career. In the 2010 national semifinals against Michigan State and against Louisville and Duke this season, Mack missed long stretches at key times with cramps.Galloy said he had converted the refrigerator in his office to Mack’s personal Gatorade stash, where after trial-and-error they have seemingly found a way to halt Mack’s cramping.They have an intricate hydration process that begins two days before a game with careful monitoring of what, how much and when he drinks during games.One reason Mack chose Butler was that he could play right away (Kentucky was loaded at off-guard). He has appeared to pick the perfect place for his game to flourish.His scoring average has risen from 11.9 to 14.1 to 16.1 in his three years. His field-goal percentage dipped this season to 41 percent from 45 percent, but Coach Brad Stevens said Mack had fought through peaks and valleys to give his coaches and teammates the ultimate confidence in him.“I always feel like the next one’s going in when he shoots it,” Stevens said.Mack ran off 10 straight points against V.C.U. with the game in the balance in the second half. Against Pittsburgh, he hit 7 of 12 from 3-point range. Against Florida, he scored 8 consecutive points to open the game.“You can’t argue with his mental toughness and his ability to make and take big shots, and he can score in bunches,” Graves said.Butler will need that type of performance Monday night. UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said Mack was a star who can “match up with anybody.”But rest assured that if the title comes down to the final possession, Butler will not be running the picket fence from “Hoosiers” for Mack. While he may fall asleep during the film, his game has opened eyes across the country during his splendid N.C.A.A. tournament.'"
"'11-04-04,'1','Re “Where the Bailout Went Wrong,” by Neil M. Barofsky (Op-Ed, March 30):It doesn’t matter whether the government is controlled by Democrats or Republicans, or whether the Treasury secretary is Timothy F. Geithner or Henry M. Paulson Jr. Programs are implemented to benefit the masters of our paper economy, not the actual producers of tangible goods and services.The Troubled Asset Relief Program illustrates the distressing state of American politics. Wall Street won, Main Street lost. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties, and their leaders, are financed by the wealthy and the corporations they control. Thus there is no political incentive to challenge the privileged position of business.Little wonder, then, that average citizens are driven to espouse the Tea Party movement (if they are social conservatives) or a Michael Moore-style populism (if they are progressives). Meanwhile, our elitist political system creates an ever-widening income disparity between the superrich and the rest of society.The writer is professor emeritus of political science at the University at Albany-SUNY.'"
"'11-04-04,'1','By contrast, Mr. Meledandri’s latest film, “Hop,” cost $63 million. A hybrid of animation and live-action, “Hop,” billed as the story of “candy, chicks and rock ’n’ roll,” was a strong No. 1 over the weekend, selling an estimated $38 million at the North American box office.Already, Mr. Meledandri’s fiscally cautious approach and track record — “Despicable Me” sold over $544 million at the global box office last summer — is re-ordering power on the Universal Pictures lot. For years, that studio’s dominant suppliers have been Imagine Entertainment, owned by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, and Working Title Films, whose movies include “Nanny McPhee.” Now Illumination at the very least stands on equal footing.Universal, which must keep all the egos in its producer ranks from colliding, plays down any rivalry. Mr. Meledandri’s ascension “should not make other producers feel competitive,” said Adam Fogelson, Universal’s chairman. While the animation giants are feeling some pressure from Illumination’s low-cost model, those competitors are also playing nice. For now.“It’s not an accident that Chris has done great,” Mr. Katzenberg said. “He’s one of the true talents in the animation field.”The rise of Illumination offers clues about the filmmaking priorities of Comcast, which took control of Universal in January. So far, the cable company has said almost nothing about its plans for the studio, and Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBC Universal, declined to comment for this article.But Hollywood is reading the tea leaves. Universal has urged Illumination to hire more executives and double output to two pictures a year by 2013. Mr. Burke is “a huge, huge fan” of Mr. Meledandri, according to one NBC Universal executive who asked for anonymity to avoid conflicts with his boss. In particular, this person said, Mr. Burke likes Mr. Meledandri’s unflashy personal style, low-cost approach and eagerness to use NBC Universal’s other divisions for marketing purposes; with “Hop,” for instance, Easter eggs were hidden in the backgrounds of NBC’s Thursday night comedies.“Our taste is in alignment,” Mr. Meledandri said of Mr. Burke, adding that he has had conversations with the NBC Universal chief about adding to Illumination’s presence at Universal theme parks.Movies in Illumination’s pipeline are animated, live-action and a combination of both. Projects include a Tim Burton adaptation of “The Addams Family,” “Despicable Me 2,” a new take on “Curious George” and a “Where’s Waldo” movie. Mr. Meledandri’s 30 or so employees in Santa Monica are working to adapt “Flanimals,” the children’s book series by Ricky Gervais.Mr. Meledandri also has close ties to the estate of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. Illumination’s version of “The Lorax” is scheduled for release next year.Audrey Geisel, the author’s widow, was soured by her experience in 2003 with “The Cat in the Hat,” which was distributed by Universal, complaining about the casting of Mike Myers and sophomoric humor in the script. But Mr. Meledandri won her trust with his work on the 2008 movie adaptation of “Horton Hears a Who!”“The quality of Chris’s work looks far beyond the means,” said Donna Langley, Universal’s co-chairwoman. “Watching him is quite a marvel to behold.”Just who is this new Hollywood heavyweight?The soft-spoken, somewhat chilly Mr. Meledandri, 51, grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where his father, Roland Meledandri, operated an exclusive men’s clothing store frequented by entertainment power figures like the producer Robert Evans, a young David Geffen and Robert Redford.After the young Mr. Meledandri graduated from Dartmouth, another customer of his father’s shop, a producer named Daniel Melnick, hired him to work as an assistant on “Footloose.” A few years later, after helping produce a string of minor films, Mr. Meledandri found himself running a production company that hit it big with “Cool Runnings,” a family comedy about the Jamaican bobsled team. That experience, combined with the birth of his first child, sent Mr. Meledandri on a path toward animation.At 20th Century Fox Mr. Meledandri made a name for himself in that field, starting with “Ice Age” in 2003. The three “Ice Age” movies attracted more than $2 billion at the global box office. His credits also include “Alvin and the Chipmunks.”“It is rare to find people whose business sense is as strong as their creative sense,” said Peter Chernin, the former president of the News Corporation, which owns Fox. “Chris probably exemplifies that combination better than anyone I know.” Although Mr. Meledandri has undoubtedly made enemies in Hollywood — everyone who succeeds here does — Mr. Chernin said he was “beloved” at Fox.Universal nabbed Mr. Meledandri in late 2007. Universal’s management at the time, in particular David Linde, who was the studio’s co-chairman, saw an opportunity to put Universal into the thick of the family entertainment chase. NBC Universal agreed to fully finance Illumination’s films. Whereas DreamWorks and Pixar do their animation in house, Illumination largely relies on an overseas rendering shop (which accounts for the spare headquarters in Santa Monica). Mr. Meledandri, who is Illumination’s chief executive, has an undisclosed equity stake, and his deal gives him a portion of box-office sales.Universal has since extended Mr. Meledandri’s contract through 2017.For all his accomplishments, Mr. Meledandri still has a lot to prove. Winning at animation is getting harder as competition grows, and DreamWorks and Pixar may be better positioned to continue leading the market because they do spend heavily on new computer technology, operate bigger development pipelines and employ their own artists. Illumination’s momentum could falter overnight with one big flop.And for all of Mr. Meledandri’s talk about lean and mean, it is difficult to stop fat from accumulating at a company over time. Asked about how he will address that challenge, Mr. Meledandri clasped his hands behind his head and stared into space for a moment. “A lot of it is about a mindset and adhering to that mindset,” he finally said. “You can’t become intoxicated with success.”'"
"'11-04-04,'1','Acción, said the chief executive, Paul Quintero, considers factors like projected cash flow and how applicants have handled credit in the past — both the highs and lows — but not collateral. And in working with Boston Beer, the lender hopes to double the proportion of its loans that go to the hospitality sector, to 30 percent from 15 percent.The program, called Brewing the American Dream and started in New England in 2008, is now expanding to New York City, as well as to Pennsylvania and Ohio.Thus far, 53 businesses have received a total of $540,000, and officials hope to lend at least $250,000 throughout the five boroughs by the end of this year. The loans generally range from $700 to $25,000, and are to be paid back between seven months and five years at an interest rate of 8.99 to 15.99 percent.“In today’s world, people know one thing about banks: They say, O.K., they’re not lending, so they assume that no one’s lending, and that’s false,” Mr. Quintero said. “What’s coming to New York is a program that we know has been effective, it’s had success, it resonates with entrepreneurs, and we’d like to have the New York City entrepreneurs be as competitive and have just the same access to capital as what we’ve been doing in New England.”Mr. Koch was inspired both by his difficulties raising capital for a craft beer company 27 years ago — back when the idea of a microbrewery “was a little bit crazy, and you just could not get a loan” — and his frustration with standard corporate philanthropic activities, like spending a day painting a community center near his offices.Given the expenditure of resources, he said — maybe $1,000 worth of painting and $5,000 worth of time and expertise — the result did not seem worth it.“I’m supposed to be creating value,” he said. “I’m a business, I’m supposed to make two and two equal eight, not two and two equal one.”So in addition to lending money, the program offers seminars that are open to recipients as well as other small businesses needing advice on the nuts and bolts of operating their companies, like where to find specialty grains or how to develop a marketing plan. Staff members from Boston Beer, including Mr. Koch, plan to begin holding the “speed-coaching” sessions in June.In the meantime, Mr. Romero, the first business owner in New York to receive a loan under the program, has big plans.He celebrated the grand opening of his new Arepas Cafe space on Friday, which will add 15 or 20 seats to the 35 he already has. He hopes that will increase his revenue by 40 percent and allow him to open a cafe in Manhattan.The loans are important, Mr. Romero said, but so is the coaching and advice that come along with them.“I didn’t know exactly how to put the money or where to put the money correctly,” he said of when he started out. “But now I feel more comfortable putting the money in expansion and making a better place for my customers.”'"
"'11-04-04,'1','Finally, in June, the 16 finalists will be flown to Savannah, Ga., where Ms. Deen lives, for a live cook-off, with four final winners receiving $25,000 and a six-month contract to star in new cooking videos on the site.In its first season, the series, which is handled by Digitas and EQAL, drew more than 5,000 video submissions, with more than 40,000 people registering on the Web site, a prerequisite for submitting videos and interacting on chat boards.Women who cook are most likely to find recipes on Web sites, followed by cookbooks and televised cooking shows, according to Mintel, a market research firm. (While some men participate on the recipe video site, representatives of the brand say it directs its marketing, as the series name makes clear, to women.)Ms. Deen’s Web site, PaulaDeen.com, which hosts the contest site, drew 299,000 unique visitors in February, according to comScore. The most popular food site, AllRecipes.com, had 17.3 million unique visitors, followed by FoodNetwork.com, with 14.2 million.“We had to figure out how to stop talking at our consumers and to have a conversation with them,” said Adam Butler, a brand manager for Philadelphia, who said the effort helped spur revenues for the brand, which had been flat for several years but in 2010 were up 5.6 percent over the year before.“We could have gone down the road of just developing a bunch of recipes ourselves, but the idea instead was to launch a community,” Mr. Butler said.New ads, by the Chicago office of McGarryBowen, part of Dentsu, show bagels only in a montage of uses, if at all, focusing instead on food preparation, like one featuring a couple preparing a romantic dinner who stir cream cheese into a tomato sauce.Philadelphia spent $28.9 million on advertising in 2010, up from $20.3 million in 2009 and $8 million in 2008, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.Bricks of cream cheese are claimed by Kraft and others to be an invention by William Lawrence, a dairy owner from Chester, N.Y., who in 1880 began distributing it in foil packets under the label Philadelphia, a brand eventually bought by Kraft in 1928. (There is no geographic connection to Philadelphia; the dairyman chose the name because the city was associated with high-quality food at the time, according to Kraft.)In the United States cream cheese market, Philadelphia dominates with a market share of more than 60 percent, followed by private label brands, with about 25 percent, according to Euromonitor International, a market data firm.Reinforcing efforts to be more of a cooking brand, Philadelphia recently introduced Cooking Creme, a refrigerated product with a consistency like sour cream that combines milk and cheese ingredients and makes cream sauces simpler to prepare.An online-only video, “Cooking With Emeril Lagasse’s Attorney,” features Mark S. Stein, who has represented the celebrity chef for two decades. In the video, by Escape Pod, Mr. Stein, seated in a law office, confesses he wishes he were a famous television chef, then tears away his suit to reveal a chef’s coat underneath, opens a door and trots onto the kitchen set of a television studio. In front of a cheering audience, Mr. Stein uses the new product to make a simplified version of Chicken Florentine.Uploaded to YouTube in February, the video has been viewed more than a million times, while another, “Cooking With a Guy Who Looks a Bit Like Emeril Lagasse,” has more than 115,000 views.The humor is meant to underscore the primary selling point for the product, which in the words of Mr. Butler, the brand manager, answers the question: “How do you get a chef-inspired, creamy, rich texture on a weeknight in less than 30 minutes?”In a March 12 promotion with yet another celebrity chef, Todd English, the brand hosted concurrent house parties at more than 10,000 homes, each with about 16 guests and samples of both the new Cooking Creme product and a line of cookware by Mr. English. Through Skype, Mr. English interacted with participants, while simultaneously hosting his cooking show live on HSN.“Our brand proponents were way out ahead of everyone else,” Jill Baskin, senior director of advertising for the cheese and dairy division at Kraft, said of the consumers who have participated in the house parties and online. “What we discovered is that for many of them we needed to sort of give them permission to make these things — and to go beyond bagels and cream cheese.”'"
"'11-04-04,'1','“It’s not clear what they are looking for, but we’re all really terrified,” said the employee, who asked not to be named for fear of drawing the attention of the police. She said the police had visited the studio three times last week to check on the documents of non-Chinese employees.By singling out Mr. Ai, the authorities are expanding a campaign against dissent that has roiled ’s embattled community of liberal and reform-minded intellectuals. In recent weeks dozens of people have been detained, including some of the country’s best-known writers and rights advocates. At least 11 of them have simply vanished into police custody. Two weeks ago, Liu Xianbin, a veteran dissident in Sichuan Province, was sentenced to 10 years on subversion charges.Last week Yang Hengjun, a Chinese-Australian novelist and democracy advocate whose blog postings are avidly followed on the mainland, disappeared in southern China as he tried to leave the country. Mr. Yang reappeared four days later, claiming he had been ill, but many friends interpreted his cryptic explanation as a roundabout acknowledgment that he had been detained by the police.Mr. Ai has run afoul of the authorities before. In 2009, he said he was beaten by officers who crashed though the door of his hotel room in the middle of the night while he was preparing to testify at the trial of a fellow dissident in , the capital of Sichuan. A month later, while attending an exhibition in , he was rushed to a hospital, where surgeons drained a pool of blood from his brain. Doctors said he would have died without the emergency surgery.Last November he was briefly confined to his home in Beijing by police officers, who he said were instructed to prevent him from attending a party in he had organized to commemorate the destruction of a million-dollar art studio that had been built at the behest of the local government. Although he never found out who ordered the demolition, he said he suspected powerful figures in Shanghai who were most likely angered by his freewheeling criticism of the government.Until now, Mr. Ai’s stature has given him wide latitude in leveling public critiques against corruption and the strictures of Communist Party rule. Last year he created an Internet audio project in which volunteers read the names of nearly 5,000 children who were killed during the earthquake in Sichuan Province in 2008. The project and a haunting art installation in composed of thousands of children’s backpacks were aimed at drawing attention to substandard construction that some experts say led to the collapse of many schools.The most recent wave of detentions was set off in February by an anonymous bulletin that originated on an American Web site, urging Chinese citizens to publicly demand political change. The protest calls, inspired by the unrest in the Arab world, were effectively quashed by the authorities, who detained or questioned dozens of prominent reformers, lawyers as well as unknown bloggers who simply forwarded news of the protests via . At the time, Mr. Ai sent out a message that sought to dissuade people from taking to the streets.Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher at in Hong Kong, described the continuing crackdown as an attempt by the country’s public security apparatus to roll back the modest civil society advances that have taken root in recent years. “It’s an attempt to redefine the limits of what kind of criticism is tolerable,” he said. “The government is moving the goalposts and a lot of people are finding themselves targeted.”After his beating at the hands of the police in 2009, Mr. Ai said he had no illusions about the consequences for those who refused to toe the line set down by the country’s leaders.“They put you under house arrest, or they make you disappear,” he said in an interview. “That’s all they can do. There’s no facing the issue and discussing it; it’s all a very simple treatment. Every dirty job has to be done by the police. Then you become a police state, because they have to deal with every problem.”'"
"'11-04-04,'1','A number of officials said that while the blow to Israel’s name had been great, the renunciation of the harshest conclusion would help in the future.“The one point of light regards future actions,” Gabriela Shalev, a law professor and most recently Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said on Israel Radio. “If we have to defend ourselves against terror organizations again, we will be able to say there is no way to deal with this terror other than the same way we did in Cast Lead.”Cast Lead is the name Israel gave to its three-week invasion of Gaza in 2008-9 aimed at stopping Hamas rockets fired from there into Israeli communities. Israel killed up to 1,400 Palestinians in that operation and lost 13 of its own. The Goldstone report accused both Israel and Hamas of war crimes because of harm to civilians.In his essay, Mr. Goldstone said that as a result of Israeli military investigations of soldiers’ wrongdoings and errors, he no longer believed that the harm done to Palestinian civilians had been intentional. He also commended Israel for carrying out the investigations while condemning Hamas for not doing so.Gen. Avi Benayahu, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, said on Israel Radio that he would like to invite Mr. Goldstone to Israel, show him around and enlist him in the state’s future public relations needs.“If there is another Lebanon war, something that cannot be dismissed out of hand, and if we are required to face another military conflict and challenge in Gaza, we will meet the same reality,” he said.General Benayahu recently revealed that he traveled to London in 2010 under an assumed identity because of fear of attracting anti-Israel protests outside his hotel and of being arrested for alleged war crimes.For others, the damage to Israel’s reputation by the Goldstone report left little room for forgiveness.“The despicable and shameful act that he perpetrated is contrary to the most fundamental moral values, natural justice and common sense to the extent that it negates his right to absolution,” the columnist Ben Caspit wrote in the Hebrew newspaper Maariv.In an e-mail response to a request for elaboration, Mr. Goldstone declined to comment beyond his article.Some on the left said they were worried that legitimate concerns about Israel’s conduct in the war had been buried under the extreme accusations of the Goldstone document.“By raising a completely false accusation, he masked in some ways the real complex issues of such a struggle,” said Moshe Halbertal, a professor of Jewish thought at Hebrew University and co-author of the army’s ethics code.Speaking by telephone from Cambridge, Mass., where he is a visiting professor at Harvard Law School this semester, Professor Halbertal added: “These have to do with to what degree soldiers assume risks in order to minimize collateral harm to civilians. This is where the moral challenge lies. And his retraction could now force the international community to look at these problems in a more serious way rather than by propaganda.”In late 2009, Mr. Halbertal wrote a highly critical article about the Goldstone report, saying that it was credulous about Hamas and wildly off base about Israel.Much about the Goldstone report has been misrepresented by those with agendas both for and against Israel. Running to more than 500 pages and including extensive and detailed testimony from Palestinians in Gaza, the report was essentially dismissed in Israel, and by its supporters, because of its harshest accusations.But human rights organizations say that much of it remains valid.“Many things that were originally part of the report are still out there as nagging questions for Israel to answer,” said Sarit Michaeli, spokeswoman for B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group. “Most Israelis don’t know about what happened in Cast Lead. There is still the need for an independent and effective inquiry into our conduct there.”Others, even among harsh critics of the report, acknowledge that the report did push the Israeli military into more rigorous investigations. “Clearly, the Goldstone report was the catalyst,” Gerald Steinberg, a political science professor and director of NGO Monitor, a pro-Israel advocacy group that tracks the work of nongovernmental organizations critical of Israel, said of the military investigations.“Before, the army high command did not understand the centrality of such accusations and the damage they could cause,” Professor Steinberg said. “Now they do, and that is a good thing.” Nonetheless, he added, the damage wrought by the report far outstripped any benefits.In Gaza, the Hamas justice minister, Mohammad al-Ghoul, said in an interview that there was nothing to investigate because shooting rockets was “a right of self-defense of the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli invasion and mass killing of Palestinians.”'"

"'11-04-05,'0','HOUSTON — Butler arrived at the national championship stage because of its scrappy identity built on rebounding, defense and hard work. The Bulldogs were never that pretty. But they were never uglier than on Monday in the national championship game.The final score — Connecticut 53, Butler 41 — might have made for an exciting football game. But it was an unsightly evening of basketball. If Butler’s play here is remembered years from now, it will be for all the wrong reasons.The Bulldogs saw layups rim out. They missed runners. They bricked jumpers. They made nine 3-pointers — on 33 attempts. The Bulldogs shot 18.8 percent.“We just didn’t make shots,” Butler Coach Brad Stevens said. “They had a lot to do with it, too.”The question at Reliant Stadium for much of the second half was whether Butler would score again. The Bulldogs went scoreless for more than six minutes in the second half.'"
"'11-04-05,'0','BEIJING — The United States, France, Britain and Germany on Monday called on China to release Ai Weiwei, an internationally known artist and increasingly vocal government critic. Mr. Ai was led away by police officers as he tried to board a plane at Beijing International Airport on Sunday morning and he has not been heard from since.A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said the United States was “deeply concerned by the trend of forced disappearances, extralegal detentions, arrests and convictions of human rights activists for exercising their internationally recognized human right for freedom of expression.”The German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said, “I appeal to the Chinese government to urgently provide clarification, and I expect Ai Weiwei to be released immediately.” Britain and France issued similar statements.Mr. Ai, 53, is the most high-profile person to be detained in a spreading Chinese government campaign against its critics. Dozens of people have been rounded up, several have been formally arrested on charges of incitement for subversion and nearly a dozen have vanished into police custody.Mr. Ai has suffered a number of recriminations in recent months as authorities have grown less and less tolerant of his criticisms of abuses of government power. Still, the authorities had seemed to give him more latitude than other critics, presumably because of his family’s status. The son of one of the country’s most beloved poets, Mr. Ai is also an architect who helped design Beijing’s Olympic stadium, the Bird’s Nest.'"
"'11-04-05,'0','The deal would make Texas Instruments the world’s third-largest semiconductor maker, after Intel and Samsung Electronics.Richard K. Templeton, the chief executive of Texas Instruments, said he believed that the deal would repay shareholders in three to four years by creating accelerated sales growth.And while such multibillion-dollar mergers are often justified on the grounds of cost savings that may come through layoffs or other consolidation, Mr. Templeton said the bigger emphasis in this case was to use a combined sales force to push the product portfolios of both companies.“This acquisition is about strength and growth,” Mr. Templeton said in a press release announcing the deal. He also said the companies could save around $100 million a year in administrative costs.In a conference call with investors, executives from the two companies faced immediate questions on two fronts: whether the companies have too much overlap in their product lines and whether the deal might face antitrust issues.Texas Instruments now sells about 14 percent of the chip industry’s analog chips, while National sells about 3 percent of that market. Texas Instruments has around 30,000 analog products, while National has around 12,000.“There is a certain amount of, how do I say this gently, duplication of products,” said Will Strauss, a chip industry analyst with the Forward Concepts Company, which follows the analog chip market. He said that, in light of such redundancies, he and other analysts he talked to were shocked by the deal.Mr. Templeton deflected such concerns by telling analysts that the product lines differ more than it may appear at first glance. For instance, he said that both companies have strength in analog communications chips but that National’s focus is on making such chips for industrial applications, while Texas Instruments has focused on the consumer market.In the conference call with investors, Mr. Templeton was asked how many of the product lines were redundant and he answered: “The intent is none.”He argued that National Semiconductor’s engineers would continue to be able to work independently in coming up with new product lines but would enjoy the benefits of having them sold by the much-larger combined sales force. “The combined sales team will be 10 times larger than National’s is today,” he said in a statement.Steve Ohr, a chip industry analyst with Gartner, said he did not accept that the two companies had no or few redundant product lines. “I don’t buy it. I simply don’t,” he said. But he said he did not doubt that the combination of the companies would lead to increased sales.“If you take T.I.’s sales staff and give them more products to sell, obviously you’re going to see more revenue.”Mr. Templeton also said that the companies were not likely to face antitrust problems in part because of what he said were the differences in their product lines. Still, the companies said they expected it could take six to nine months for the deal to close because they must obtain regulatory approval not just in the United States but in several overseas markets.'"
"'11-04-05,'0','But a senior American military officer with access to classified intelligence reports discounted those doubts on Monday: “This is a reflection of the turmoil in the country, not some political decision to stop.”Mr. Saleh’s son and three nephews are in charge of four of Yemen’s main security and counterterrorism agencies, including the Republican Guard and the Central Security Forces, which are trained and equipped by the United States. If they were forced to step down as part of any deal to remove Mr. Saleh, American officials acknowledge that the country’s counterterrorism efforts would be left in the hands of untested lieutenants.“We have had a lot of counterterrorism cooperation from President Saleh and Yemeni security services,” Defense Secretary said March 27 on ABC’s “This Week.” “So if that government collapses or is replaced by one that is dramatically more weak, then I think we’ll face some additional challenges out of Yemen. There’s no question about it. It’s a real problem.”Perhaps most worrisome, American intelligence officials have collected information from informants and electronic intercepts that Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen has increased planning discussions about another attack. This increased threat “chatter,” as intelligence officials call the reports, was first reported by The Washington Post late last month, but officials say the trend has continued since then.The Qaeda group in Yemen is responsible for failed plots to blow up a commercial airliner as it approached on Dec. 25, 2009, and for planting printer cartridges packed with explosives on cargo planes bound for last October.The United States now has about 75 Special Forces trainers and support personnel in Yemen, as well as an unspecified number of operatives. The Americans in Yemen are working closely with dozens of British special forces and intelligence officers, as well as operatives from ’s spy agencies. While the Americans largely provide intelligence, the Yemeni counterterrorism troops have conducted raids and attacks on suspected terrorists in recent months.The suspension of these Yemeni counterterrorism operations and the heightened Al Qaeda activity have prompted the United States Central Command to dust off plans to resume airstrikes against top Qaeda targets if the United States receives solid intelligence about the location of senior militants, a senior military official said.The United States has not carried out such airstrikes in Yemen since last May, when an attack accidentally killed a deputy governor and set off a huge political dispute with Mr. Saleh. Last year, the United States quietly began patrolling Yemen with armed .One top insurgent on the American target list is , the Yemeni-American cleric who is a top propagandist for Al Qaeda. Last Wednesday, Mr. Awlaki broke his silence on the uprisings in the Arab world to speak glowingly in a new issue of the English-language Qaeda magazine Inspire about the toppling of autocratic governments.Pentagon officials said that the chaotic security conditions in the country might embolden senior Qaeda officials in Yemen to come out of hiding. “If we have Awlaki in our sights, we’ll take a shot,” the senior American military officer said on Monday.Over the past year, however, the American Special Forces in Yemen have shifted their focus to help the Yemeni security forces carrying out the counterterrorism missions. But those programs to train and assist the Yemenis have also been suspended in the wake of the political tumult. The American Special Forces soldiers are keeping a low profile but are maintaining ties with midlevel and senior Yemeni officers, and provide information on how the military is reacting to the upheaval.American officials privately concede they have only a marginal influence on Mr. Saleh’s fight for his political survival and exit from power. At best, these officials say, the Americans are looking to identify and carefully support competent lower-ranking officers and civilian officials who could take over the security agencies if Mr. Saleh’s relatives are forced to flee.Gregory Johnsen, a scholar who closely tracks militants in Yemen, said the United States’ narrow focus on combating Al Qaeda through military operations overseen by Mr. Saleh and his family means its position could be precarious in a post-Saleh Yemen.“The U.S. idea of tying counterterrorism to this one family has not been the best way to approach the Al Qaeda problem,” said Mr. Johnsen, who has argued for greater focus on development aid for the impoverished country.The Yemeni government’s already weak reach is withering by the day, as violent rack several parts of the impoverished country. American officials said they were watching unrest in Shabwa Province, a Qaeda stronghold, as well as in Jaar, a city in the southern province of Abyan where Al Qaeda is known to have set up a base.An officer in Yemen’s counterterrorism forces said his unit had not been deployed and was on standby, even though much of the south was apparently outside government control and jihadists had apparently declared a separate emirate in Abyan. Yemeni counterterrorism officers would like to respond, but “we are only door-kickers,” he said. “We need support from the army, and the army is busy splitting.”'"
"'11-04-05,'0','The administration of Mayor has outlawed in restaurants, bars and playgrounds, and outside hospital entrances. Even city parks, and pedestrian plazas will soon be off limits to smokers. Then there have been successive rounds of — the most recent one, a $1.60 rise in the state tax in July — that raised the price of a pack of cigarettes to $12.50 at many Midtown newsstands.“The tax went up, and we started selling 10 times as much,” Mr. Warner said. “Bloomberg thinks he’s stopping people from smoking. He’s just turning them onto loosies.”Mr. Warner and his partners patrol the east side of Eighth Avenue, from 35th to 36th Street. He started out on Seventh Avenue, but eventually moved a block west, in front of Staples at 35th. “You look for the crowd,” he said.Mr. Warner said he believed that the official price was above what many people were willing or able to pay. As evidence, he noted that his customers included office workers from as far south as 32nd Street and as far north as 40th Street — people with good-paying jobs, as far as he can discern.Mr. Warner said he bought his cigarettes — almost always Newports — for a bit over $50 a carton from smugglers who get them in states like , where the state tax is well under a dollar a pack. He then resells them for 75 cents each, two for $1 or $8 for a pack ($7 for friends).Mr. Warner said he and each of his two partners took home $120 to $150 a day, profit made from selling about 2,000 cigarettes, mostly two at a time. Each transaction is a misdemeanor offense.Among all of Midtown’s cigarette vendors, Mr. Warner stands out, partly because he seems to get arrested more frequently than others. That may be because his style of salesmanship is hardly furtive.“The cops call me a fish — that’s my nickname, cause I’m easy to catch,” Mr. Warner said during a series of recent interviews. “When they need a body to arrest, they come pick me up.”In the four years since he began selling cigarettes, Mr. Warner recalls being arrested 15 times, generally on the charge of selling untaxed tobacco. He has been arrested so often that he can recognize 10 different plainclothes police officers, he claims. The ever-present risk of arrest makes working with partners valuable — “we have six eyes on this block,” he explained.Over many court appearances, Mr. Warner has made a favorable impression on the lawyers in Midtown Community Court, who know him as Lonnie Loosie and consider him better company than the typical misdemeanor defendant.“There are people who are known bad guys, and then there’s him,” said Russell S. Novack, the Legal Aid lawyer who represents many of Midtown’s hustlers, prostitutes, shoplifters and public drunks. “He’s like the goodwill ambassador of Eighth Avenue. And when he comes into court, he says hello to everybody.”For Mr. Warner, punishment usually means a few days in jail on , or a week of community service, some of it spent sweeping cigarette butts.Mr. Warner asserts that the block is safer and less unruly because of him.“We don’t allow people to sell drugs on this block,” he said. “We just don’t allow it.”Mr. Warner grew up in Jersey City and spent about two decades in prisons for a series of armed robberies. Those crimes date from a time when he says he was addicted to crack cocaine.After his release from a 13-year sentence in 2006, Mr. Warner tried to find steady work in New York, but was invariably rebuffed — because of his felony status, he suspects. When he considers his options for making a living, he sees few besides selling loosies.“I’m sorry that it’s come to this, but this is what it’s come to,” he said.He said he would like to work someday as a barker for tour buses, selling ’s attractions to wandering tourists.“I love the streets,” he said. “I love the people in the streets.”In his time, Mr. Warner has learned a lot about smokers’ habits. He sometimes hears from customers who explain to him they are quitting as they buy two final loosies.“A lot of them believe they are quitting,” he said, “but they come back every day.”For the moment, business is good enough that Mr. Warner said he intended to buy for the first time. He currently relies on his periodic stays on Rikers Island — an occupational hazard — for medical attention. “When they screen me, I ask for all the blood tests,” he said.Mr. Warner knows few customers by name, but dozens by face. He often tells female customers that they are too pretty to smoke, just before completing the sale. What he will not do is light a cigarette for anybody. Start offering customers a light and “you’ll have a crowd of four or five smokers around you in no time,” Mr. Warner explained. That could attract the police.When he is on the move, as he often is, Mr. Warner walks exceptionally fast. Covering tremendous stretches of sidewalk each day keeps him fit. He is often pulled away from his Eighth Avenue post on business.Mr. Warner carries only one or two cartons of cigarettes in his backpack, because that is the most he cares to lose should he be arrested. So each time he and his two partners run out, Mr. Warner takes the train up to , or walks a few blocks east to meet one of his half-dozen suppliers, mostly immigrants from West Africa.There are also deliveries to make. Mr. Warner is constantly on his cellphone scheduling meetings in the lobbies of office buildings, where he will drop off a pack. “A lot of customers, especially women, don’t like coming out to the block,” he explained. “They think it’s too hot.”At the end of the day, Mr. Warner returns to Harlem, where he often stays with his girlfriend. But even in bed, he is unable to put his day entirely behind him. His girlfriend sometimes complains, he said, that he mutters the word “Newports” again and again in his sleep.'"
"'11-04-05,'0','With the Iraq and Afghanistan wars still under way, in addition to military action in Libya and uncertainty across the Middle East, the president heads toward re-election in a far different position from when he started his first race four years ago as an antiwar candidate favored by many liberal Democrats. A slow economic recovery also complicates his path to a second term.“We’ll start by doing something unprecedented: coordinating millions of one-on-one conversations between supporters across every single state, reconnecting old friends, inspiring new ones to join the cause, and readying ourselves for next year’s fight,” Mr. Obama said ’in a message to supporters.While it may seem early to begin planning for an election in which he most likely will not face a Democratic primary challenger, the timeline for Mr. Obama is only slightly earlier than those of his two recent predecessors. President Bill Clinton filed his re-election papers on April 14, 1995, and George W. Bush formally opened his campaign on May 16, 2003.“We also need to begin mobilizing for 2012,” Mr. Obama wrote, “long before the time comes for me to begin campaigning in earnest.”Like all incumbent presidents before him, Mr. Obama will seek to balance the daily demands of the Oval Office with the realities of campaigning over the next 19 months. He is scheduled to headline fund-raising events for the Democratic National Committee this month in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.The president filed papers Monday with the Federal Election Commission, a step that allows him to begin raising money and running a campaign organization, but he was not seen in public. He had a series of calls with party leaders, key Democratic constituencies and an evening conference call with a few thousand activists from the last campaign.The president and his advisers sought to focus attention on the re-election bid on Monday to reinvigorate the army of volunteers and coalition of supporters who were central to the 2008 victory. Yet behind the scenes, an aggressive fund-raising campaign also began, with top donors asked to contribute $5,000 — $2,500 for the primary season and another $2,500 for the general election.“We’re doing this now because the politics we believe in does not start with expensive TV ads or extravaganzas, but with you, with people organizing block-by-block, talking to neighbors, co-workers, and friends,” Mr. Obama wrote. “And that kind of campaign takes time to build.”Much of his domestic travel has involved visits to battleground states, featuring topics like education and the economy that are of top concern to voters. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama is heading to Pennsylvania, which he carried in 2008, to discuss energy policy, a pressing topic for many voters at a time when gasoline is averaging $4 a gallon. And on Friday he travels to Indiana, which went Democratic in 2008 for the first time in four decades, to tour a manufacturing plant.Last week, Mr. Obama gave a widely covered speech on energy policy before an audience of about 1,000 enthusiastic students at Georgetown University — just the sort of potential first-time voters that Mr. Obama attracted in 2008 and hopes to again. He departed from his script several times with remarks tailored directly to the students.The president and his wife, Michelle, also recently participated in a White House conference on bullying in schools, a topic that polls indicate to be of great interest to women. While the event was not a big draw with many Washington reporters, it was prominently covered by local newspapers and television stations, including those in swing-voting states like Florida, Colorado and Ohio, according to an administration official who monitors news coverage.That suggests the emphasis that the Obama team is putting on local communities. The president has invited reporters from several local television stations in battleground states — Iowa, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, to name a few — to the White House for interviews.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is a key surrogate. On Monday, Mr. Biden was at the University of New Hampshire to discuss with students and local residents the administration’s efforts to reduce sex crimes on campuses, an issue that resonates with younger and female voters.'"
"'11-04-05,'0','The company has already paid a price for choosing the road less traveled. While its engines have been in development, its share of the United States market for the heaviest trucks fell to 20.2 percent this year, down from 28.5 percent in 2009, according to researchers at JPMorgan.Many of Navistar’s fellow truck makers and some environmental groups have dismissed the company’s complaints as the desperate grumblings of a truck builder that painted itself into a corner with a system that some have written off as impractical — the Betamax of pollution control technology.Navistar says its approach to NOx reduction will ultimately be justified.“We didn’t make this decision lightly,” said Jack Allen, the president of the company’s North American Truck Group. “We’ve been making diesel engines for 75-plus years, and we evaluated every alternative that was out there. We’re confident that our solution is what customers will want.”Operators of truck fleets say they are keeping an open mind.But so far, the add-on systems made by other truck companies offer the best combination of “fuel performance, upfront purchase price and running costs,” said Art Vallely, senior vice president of rental and vehicle management for Penske Truck Leasing, which operates 200,000 vehicles.Diesel engines in the nation’s 18-wheelers, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles power less than 10 percent of all vehicle traffic in the United States, but they account for an outsize portion of the haze of pollution that hangs over many American cities — as much as 25 percent by some estimates.Reducing those emissions is an engineering challenge in which every tweak has consequences. Reducing the temperature of combustion, for example, is an easy way to reduce NOx emissions. But it also generates more soot — the black smoke coming out of a diesel engine. The soot levels can be reduced by altering the timing of combustion, but that raises fuel consumption.Standing on the floor of Navistar’s engine facility here, Luis C. Cattani, a chief engineer with the company, recalled that he was discouraged by colleagues from joining Navistar after a career designing high-performance engines in Detroit. “They said, ‘Oh, you’ll be so bored,’ ” Mr. Cattani said. “But as an engineer, you really love this sort of challenge.”Recognizing the complexity of the issue, the E.P.A. gave truck makers a decade to engineer a solution when it issued new NOx limits in 2001. Navistar was an early proponent of a technique called exhaust gas recirculation, or E.G.R., a well-established process in which burned gases from the engine exhaust are routed back to the cylinder, diluting the mixture and lowering the temperature of combustion, which in turn reduces the amount of NOx formed.Most other heavy-duty truck makers in the United States — along with makers of diesel passenger cars like BMW and Mercedes-Benz — elected to primarily control NOx with a different technology, called selective catalytic reduction, or S.C.R. This method uses liquid urea, a chemical compound commonly synthesized for a variety of industrial uses, which is injected into the exhaust to effectively break down the pollutant.Though the E.P.A. does not prescribe technologies for meeting its standards, it did suggest, back in 2001, that liquid urea would be an unlikely candidate. The system would require a whole new infrastructure for making urea available at truck stops across the country and would rely on drivers monitoring and refilling an on-board urea tank.Still, as the 2010 deadline approached, the industry had failed to come up with any alternative to the urea technology that could meet the emission standards. So the E.P.A. allowed truck makers to use it as long as other components, like warning lights on the dashboard, audible alarms and even engine slowing, were included to alert drivers that the urea supply was low and nudge them to refill it.Meanwhile, when the deadline hit, Navistar was still trying to develop a compliant engine using its technology. Its engines were producing NOx levels at almost double the limit, although the company continued to sell them, offsetting the extra emissions with credits they’d earned from engines in other classes that performed better than E.P.A.’s standards.Even as it struggled to refine its technology, Navistar attacked its rivals’ approach. The company argued that the urea-based technology was ineffective in some circumstances, such as stop-and-go traffic — precisely when control of emissions is most needed. In addition, the company claimed that the urea system could be easily bypassed with simple tricks like putting water into the urea storage tank.Navistar sued the E.P.A. and the California Air Resources Board, accusing them of relaxing the legal standards. The suits were settled last summer after both agencies agreed to conduct a public review of their policies regarding the urea technology.Rich Kassel, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said there was no evidence that drivers were actually bypassing trucks’ urea systems.“And the reason why there’s no evidence that they’re doing it is if you run the truck with low levels of urea, you start getting a series of signals, both lights and audible signals,” he said. If the signals are ignored, the engine slows down. “For a driver who is carrying a full load for any length of time, they’re not going to risk losing the power,” Mr. Kassel said. “It’s a trucker I.Q. test.”Cummins, an engine maker that had planned to emulate Navistar’s technology but used the urea technology instead, said the safeguards worked as designed. “Our engines are programmed to ‘de-rate’ in these cases, which would result in drivers not being able to maintain highway speeds,” said Mark Land, a Cummins spokesman.Still, as part of the legal settlement, the E.P.A. agreed to revisit its guidance on the NOx limits. In an e-mail, Karl Simon, a compliance official in the E.P.A.’s transportation and air quality office, said the agency was “continuing to evaluate information from all manufacturers and looks to identify areas where manufacturers can continue to improve their S.C.R. systems in order to provide additional assurances that emission controls are properly working.”Caterpillar, a vehicle maker that recently unveiled a short-haul truck that uses a Navistar engine, said the Navistar approach would ultimately prove to be a winner. “The customer is looking for simplicity,” said George Taylor, general manager of Caterpillar’s on-highway truck group, “not technology.”'"
"'11-04-05,'0','Tex Winter, an innovator of the triangle offense; Chris Mullin, who led St. John’s to the Final Four in 1985; and Dennis Rodman, a colorful player known for his rebounding, were selected for the Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday.The announcement came at the Final Four in Houston.The 10 members of the class of 2011 also include Tara VanDerveer, the women’s coach at Stanford; Herb Magee, the men’s coach at Philadelphia University; the former European star Arvydas Sabonis; the former A.B.A. and N.B.A. player Artis Gilmore; the former Boston Celtics player Tom Sanders, who was known as Satch; the Olympic medalist Teresa Edwards; and the Harlem Globetrotter Reece Tatum, who was known as Goose.The selection of Winter, 89, is considered long overdue. He helped tweak the offense of Sam Barry, his coach at Southern California. Known as the triangle offense, it has benefited from gifted players like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. Coach Phil Jackson is attempting to win a 12th N.B.A. title while primarily using the offense, which is based on spacing and cutting.Mullin played for the Golden State Warriors and the Indiana Pacers. He helped establish the Big East as a top conference and was part of the original Olympic Dream Team in 1992.Rodman will join his former Chicago Bulls teammates Jordan and Scottie Pippen in the Hall. Rodman started his N.B.A. career with the Detroit Pistons before reinventing himself, being known as much for his erratic behavior, tattoos, changing hair colors and body piercings as for his rebounding and other on-court achievements. He was named to the league’s all-defensive first team seven times and collected five championships.The induction ceremony is in Springfield, Mass., in August.This year’s selection process became controversial when noteworthy candidates like Reggie Miller, who held the N.B.A. record for most 3-pointers until it was broken by Ray Allen this season, and Don Nelson, who last year set the record for N.B.A. career coaching victories, failed to make the cut.Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of the Hall, defended voting members’ anonymity to prevent politicking.

One of Mr. Vu’s lawyers was ejected from the court after making procedural objections, and his three other lawyers walked out in protest.Mr. Vu, who holds a law degree from the Sorbonne, is not licensed to practice in Vietnam but runs a law firm in Hanoi with his wife and has spoken out on a variety of sensitive issues.He was arrested in November and charged with antistate propaganda for posting critical articles on the Web and giving interviews “maligning party and state institutions and policies,” according to the government.In calling for a multiparty system he said the Communist Party serves only “the illegal benefits of a small group” and he criticized the jailing of “hundreds of thousands” of former South Vietnamese soldiers and officials after the Communists won the Vietnam War in 1975.In 2009 he sued Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung for approving a controversial Chinese-run bauxite mining operation in the Central Highlands and last year he sued him again for signing a decree that prohibited class-action lawsuits.Mr. Vu is the latest of dozens of Vietnamese lawyers and activists arrested over the past five years for challenging the government. He had faced up to 12 years in prison on the charge, which is often used against political dissidents.“The authorities were determined to make an example of him,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, “and I’m sure they are doing this with one eye to try to tamp down and push back into the corner many of these organizations and activist groups that have come out in support of him.”Mr. Robertson said he had received reports that a number of people who had gathered around the courthouse had been arrested. He said it appeared that the authorities had tried to call in bloggers for appointments to keep them from reporting on the trial.He said he had seen nothing to indicate that the government’s hard line against dissent was related to the current uprisings in the Middle East.A clandestine video distributed on the Internet Monday showed police officers in dark green uniforms diverting traffic and blocking the crowd from approaching the courthouse. Much of the crowd was drawn by calls on the Internet that included maps of the streets around the courthouse that went to far as to indicate the location of public toilets. Vigils at Catholic churches were inspired by Mr. Vu’s support last year for Catholics embroiled in a land dispute with the authorities.The vigorous support on the streets and the Internet probably worked against Mr. Vu as the government seeks to demonstrate its control, said Carlyle A. Thayer, a Vietnam specialist at the University of New South Wales. “The question is why they can’t do a better job of controlling the Internet,” he said. “The answer is they can’t, it’s out of control.”As in other high-profile political trials, the outcome was probably decided ahead of time at a high level, Mr. Thayer said. “The prime minister may be a liberal economic reformer but he’s not liberal politically,” he said. “Someone who launched repeated attempts to undermine his decisions is likely to have incurred his wrath.”'"

"'11-04-06,'1','Man has very little to do with the well-being of dogs in two new, very funny books about our pets and the company they keep. “Say Hello to Zorro!,” by Carter Goodrich, observes the relationship between old dog and new, while “Scritch-Scratch a Perfect Match,” by Kimberly Marcus, considers the relationship between dog and flea. Neither twosome forms a fast or easy friendship.In “Zorro,” Mister Bud, a sloppy-nosed dog of indeterminate breed, lives a life of fixed ease. “It went like this: (1) Wake-up time. (2) Biscuit, then a walk time.” And so forth — a sly comment, perhaps, on today’s overscheduled kids and their overcommitted parents. (If so, “Zorro” joins some other recent books that touch on the perils of too much routine. Tammi Sauer and Jeff Mack’s “Mr. Duck Means Business,” to name one, likewise shows the chaos that life and the lives of others can inflict on the iCalendar.)And so it is that Mister Bud is ill prepared to contend with a new household member, Zorro, a growly pug who can be bossy and insulting. It’s said that dogs believe they are human until confronted with the reality of another dog. Soon enough, Mister Bud and Zorro discover that despite their differences, they share a similar agenda.Goodrich, who has illustrated multiple New Yorker covers and has also designed characters for animated films like “Monsters, Inc.” and “Despicable Me,” here creates animals that are emotionally expressive, humorous and recognizably individual. Somewhere, someone knows these dogs – and has learned to laugh at their foibles.“Scritch-Scratch,” too, is illustrated with a great deal of humor, in this case by an editorial cartoonist, Mike Lester (“A Is for Salad,”). Marcus’s story, her debut, is written in playful rhyming couplets with a this-leads-to-that storyline recalling “Because a Little Bug Went Ka-Choo!,” by Dr. Seuss (writing as Rosetta Stone) and Michael Frith.But it is the cartoon drawings that snap the ideas into action: “Awoomph was the sound as he dropped like a sack, landing Thud! ‘Oh crud!’ on an old man’s back.” Lester’s pictures of a flea-ridden dog convey the itchy torture that today’s louse- and bedbug-infested readers will easily identify with. In this particular story, which ends mostly happily, the bug has the last bite.'"

"'11-04-06,'1','The Republican plan would also slash individual and corporate income taxes by more than $4 trillion below current projections, somewhat offsetting the spending cuts and limiting the overall reduction in the deficit.Under the Ryan plan, military spending would not be cut any more than the $78 billion in cuts Mr. Obama has proposed.“Washington has not been telling you the truth,” Mr. Ryan said in a short video making the case for bold action. “If we don’t reform spending on government health and retirement programs, we have zero hope of getting our spending — and as a result our debt crisis — under control.”His plan would go beyond the bold packages recommended in December by bipartisan majorities of two separate debt-reduction panels — Mr. Obama’s 2010 fiscal commission, which was headed by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and former White House chief of staff, and former Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and the commission headed by the former longtime Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete V. Domenici, and Alice Rivlin, former director of the Congressional and White House budget offices.It also would go further in shrinking government and cutting taxes than the changes that Congressional Republicans proposed in the mid-1990s after they last took control of the House — a showdown that ended to the advantage of Democrats.The House Republicans’ proposal poses challenges for Mr. Obama as well. Many Democratic strategists, including some inside the White House and the president’s re-election campaign, see mostly opportunity: pleasantly surprised that Republicans have defined themselves so far to the right, they see a chance for Mr. Obama to stake out a middle ground.But with Republicans describing their move as a bold leadership stroke, their boast has the potential to feed a budding narrative — that Mr. Obama has declined to lead in proposing the steps needed to rein in a federal debt that is growing unsustainably as the population ages and health care costs keep rising.Mr. Obama, in an unexpected appearance before reporters Tuesday at the White House, said the Ryan plan ensured that Republicans and Democrats would have “very sharply contrasting visions in terms of where we should move the country.”“I’m looking forward to having that conversation,” he added.The White House later issued a harsher statement from the press secretary Jay Carney.The Ryan plan, it said, “cuts taxes for millionaires and special interests while placing a greater burden on seniors who depend on Medicare or live in nursing homes, families struggling with a child who has serious disabilities, workers who have lost their health care coverage, and students and their families who rely on Pell grants.”“The president believes there is a more balanced way to put America on a path to prosperity,” the statement said.Administration officials gave no hint that Mr. Obama planned to spell out that balanced approach. The 10-year budget he outlined in February did not tackle the fast-growing entitlement costs — for Medicare, Medicaid and, to a far lesser extent, Social Security — that are driving long-term projections of the debt. While proposing major changes to Medicaid and Medicare, Mr. Ryan also declined to propose changes to Social Security, reflecting Republicans’ wariness of alienating older voters.Deficit hawks in both parties praised Mr. Ryan for the breadth of the plan. But they criticized him for not proposing to cut military spending more or to raise tax revenues.Like the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission and other bipartisan groups, Mr. Ryan would eliminate many, though unspecified, income tax breaks to generate greater federal income. But unlike the other groups, he would use the new revenues only to lower tax rates to a maximum 25 percent for individuals and corporations, down from 35 percent. Again, details would be left to the appropriate legislative committees. The other deficit study groups would devote some revenues to reducing deficits.“Because Ryan decided to basically ignore defense and not use any of the reduction in tax expenditures to reduce the deficit, it does place a disproportionately adverse effect on other parts of the budget,” Mr. Bowles said in an interview, including “the things that I think are important to protect the truly disadvantaged.”Mr. Ryan was a member of the Bowles-Simpson panel but, like the other two House Republicans in the group, he opposed its recommendations for more than $4 trillion in 10-year savings for not going far enough in reducing health care spending.His plan underscores just how much the influx of Republican newcomers to the House, many of them Tea Party adherents, have hardened conservatism there.In the past two years, House Republicans distanced themselves from a similar plan that Mr. Ryan proposed. Even after the midterm elections in November, when he was in line to become the Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Ryan said in an interview that he probably would have to moderate his proposals to win other Republicans’ backing.'"
"'11-04-06,'1','CAIRO — Human rights groups on Tuesday raised their estimates of the death toll from unrest in Syria, as protest organizers there continued their call for more demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.The tally has risen steadily in recent days as rights groups have struggled to document the number of dead from a government crackdown on dissent that began more than two weeks ago.Wissam Tarif, the executive director of Insan, a Syrian rights group, said that at least 173 people had died in the unrest, including 15 in Douma, a working-class suburb northwest of Damascus, and 143 in and around Dara’a, the southern area where the protests began.The Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, working with the Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies, said it had documented 123 deaths, including 22 in Douma. It said it did not have a number of dead in Dara’a.Both groups said their figures were based on testimony from doctors, families of the dead and witnesses. It was impossible to verify their numbers.Pro-democracy advocates have called for a week of renewed protests in honor of those who have died, labeling it “a week of martyrs.” The advocates are part of a Facebook group called The Syrian Revolution 2011, which has more than 100,000 members.Documenting the dead in Syria is complicated by the omnipresence of security forces and the government’s refusal to release the bodies of many of those killed at demonstrations, said Mr. Tarif and Radwan Ziadeh, the director of the Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies. The authorities in Douma have released 15 bodies, Mr. Ziadeh said, but families of seven more men have been told by witnesses that they were killed at protests.'"

"'11-04-06,'1','In case customers need convincing, the Harry & David team has been busy hooking a camera up to the Internet so people can eventually watch the sweet bounty of Medford as it ripens.Debt may be a serious threat on the financial front, but Harry & David’s orchard cam illustrates a different sort of peril for anyone who makes or sells a food product that has long been viewed as an established emblem of luxury. When there is a profusion of new choices, the allure of earlier choices can begin to dim. Sometimes it’s hard to stay smitten with a care package shipped from the Pacific Northwest in the belly of a jet when you can pick your own heirloom fruit right off the branches at a nearby orchard that supposedly provided sustenance to soldiers during the Revolutionary War.Think of this as Brie Syndrome. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, it was de rigueur, when guests came over, to haul out a cold wheel of Brie.“It was the first imported cheese that we knew and we could pronounce,” said Jason Tesauro, an author of the book “The Modern Gentleman: A Guide to Essential Manners, Savvy & Vice,” who curates high-end parties and tasting events from his headquarters in Richmond, Va.Over time, though, Americans began to learn about manchego and Humboldt Fog and mimolette and Époisses. “Everybody just started getting more and more sophisticated about cheese,” said Susan Holland, a New York event producer. “There’s fabulous Brie, but Brie got pushed aside in the rush to learn new things, and it became not chic. It became the opposite of chic.”These days, as the American gourmand becomes increasingly obsessed with the origins and purity of every organic nibble that might appear on, say, a cheese and fruit platter, it takes extra effort to fend off the vogue for shaggy, independent upstarts.“The new fancy is knowing the provenance of your food,” Mr. Tesauro said. “Fancy is that muddy boot-print on the kitchen floor from where Farmer Clark brought in the first asparagus of the season.”More than ever, in this craft-fixated era, what’s ordered in a restaurant, sent as a gift or served at a cocktail party acts as a subtle gesture about one’s level of culinary sophistication. Which means people have to stay alert to the shifts.“What you see with Harry & David is that they really didn’t adapt,” said Pamela N. Danziger, a consultant and author who has focused, in books like “Let Them Eat Cake,” on the fine points of luxury marketing. “We are really evolving toward more of a connoisseur culture. Why would you buy a Harry & David pear when you can go to Whole Foods and get the same quality pear?”Brie Syndrome afflicts a wide range of foods and drinks that have had a challenging time holding onto their Fancy Champion of the World status. Chowhounds who are old enough to remember the days when Whitney Houston and Phil Collins dominated the pop charts can attest that, yes, there was a time when a plate of cold pasta salad with sun-dried tomatoes, accompanied by a glass of Perrier and followed by a handful of Famous Amos cookies, was considered a lunch fit for a duchess.If tiramisù could speak, it would surely tell us that nothing lasts forever. (Watch your back, pork belly.)Nowhere is Brie Syndrome more striking than in the realm of chocolate. Around the time that Brie was fastening its moldy grip on the American consciousness, the go-to brand for cocoa-bean luxury was, indisputably, Godiva. Back then, even though the chocolatier was owned by the Campbell’s Soup conglomerate, which later sold it to a giant Turkish company called Yildiz Holding, Godiva was often portrayed with the kind of lingo that we might now use to describe some small-batch chocolate ambrosia made by elves stirring medieval bronze caldrons in a monastically temperature-controlled loft in Seattle.“Our positioning is clearly as a super-premium chocolate in the Belgian tradition,” James A. Goldman, Godiva’s president and chief executive, said in a phone interview last week. “We’re very much true to that.”On the other hand, “one of the big challenges we’ve had is, yes, we’re super-premium, yes, we’re luxury and prestige, but we don’t want to be viewed as unapproachable,” he said. “We were kind of putting ourselves into a corner by being so up on a pedestal.”To that end, boxes of Godiva sweets can now be bought in malls and corner drugstores. There are American-palate-friendly flavor combinations, such as mint-chocolate chip, red-velvet cake and chocolate lava cake, whose terroir probably has more in common with T.G.I. Friday’s than with Brussels. There are nods, too, to the current jones for provenance and all things handmade.“That has been a trend, and I think it actually has made all of us better,” Mr. Goldman said. “We have a line of artisanal barks. These are kind of lumpy, bumpy, crunchy slabs of chocolate and other ingredients. We even have a cookies & cream one. That sort of links to the artisanal desires out there.“One of the best products we’ve got for Easter is this sort of beaded egg, which is very artisanal-looking,” he added.As a $600-million colossus, Godiva doesn’t have to worry much about a $1.2-million-a-year pipsqueak like Madécasse, a chocolate start-up, with a main office in Brooklyn, that prides itself on a bean-to-bar ethos. Its ingredients are grown and harvested in Madagascar, and the bars of chocolate are made there, too, putting more money in local hands. For customers, that story is a selling point.“It’s why they pick us up,” said Tim McCollum, 33, a founder of the company. “The education of the chocolate consumer has evolved pretty considerably.”Madécasse may be small, but the threat to mainstream dominance isn’t always a new product. In this case, it’s a new idea. “For anyone who’s into chocolate, Godiva is a weird concept,” Mr. McCollum said. “If you go back 10 years, high-end chocolate was Lindt, Ghirardelli and Godiva. Now that’s what you’d buy at CVS, at Duane Reade, at a rest stop on the Jersey Turnpike.”All of that class-to-mass growth may lead to a frothier revenue stream, but it changes the way formerly fancy entities like Godiva and Harry & David are perceived.Then again, it would be a mistake to rule out the power of nostalgia — or at least dug-in habits.Rob Kaufelt, the owner of Murray’s Cheese Shop, points out that in the 20 years he’s been introducing New Yorkers to an endless variety of cheeses, Brie has remained among his top 10 sellers.“Brie is still popular,” Mr. Kaufelt said. “Things may go out of fashion, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not popular. And like all of fashion, if you wait long enough, it’ll come back around again.”He could be right. On the phone, Ms. Holland started mulling over the idea of a theme party at which the formerly fancy wheel of cheese could act as a curveball pièce de résistance.“If you wanted something retro and ironic, then we could serve baked Brie,” she said. “And it would be delicious.”'"
"'11-04-06,'1','Yet why is it so important to Barack Obama (a champion of community colleges) and those doing America’s hiring, he asks, that “our bank tellers be college educated, and our medical billing techs, our county tax clerks”? College — even community college — drives many young people into debt. Many others lack rudimentary study skills or any scholarly inclination. They want to get on with their lives, not be forced to analyze the meter in “King Lear” in night school in order to become a cop or a nurse’s aide.“No one is thinking about the larger implications, or even the morality,” Professor X says, “of admitting so many students to classes they cannot possibly pass.”In marshaling his persuasive arguments, Professor X draws on the work of scholars and sociologists and demographers, and clearly he’s picking up on sentiments floating in the air. Matthew B. Crawford’s best-selling book “Shop Class as Soulcraft,” published in 2009, was an ode to vocational training and dignified blue-collar work.Yet many reacted angrily to Professor X’s article (he prints some of the nastier letters he received here) as if he were proposing — to paraphrase Paul Fussell in his book “Class” — the beating to death of baby whales using the dead bodies of baby seals.Professor X is unruffled. One thing adjunct professors are good at, he notes, is delivering bad news.“We may look mild-mannered, we adjunct professors, in our eyeglasses and our corduroy jackets, our bald heads and trimmed beards,” he declares, in his calmly invigorating style, “but we are nothing less than academic hit men. We are paid by the college to perform the dirty work that no one else wants to do, the wrenching, draining, sorrowful business of teaching and failing the unprepared who often don’t even know they are unprepared.”He adds, in a flamenco flourish: “We are not characters out of great academic novels such as ‘Pnin’ or ‘Lucky Jim.’ We have more in common with Anton Chigurh from ‘No Country for Old Men.’ I am John Travolta in ‘Pulp Fiction’ but in a corduroy jacket and bow tie. I feel evil and soiled.”On its trip from essay to book “In the Basement of the Ivory Tower” has taken some odd detours. It’s morphed into something new. The author hasn’t greatly expanded his argument, but he’s turned the book into more of a memoir. It’s a sad, haunted tale that zeroes in on all the things that send people into therapy (or memoir writing): money, class, failure and real estate.Professor X, a thwarted novelist who long ago took a day job working for the government, was driven into adjunct work because he and his wife bought the wrong house at the wrong time. They couldn’t meet their monthly nut. It was, he writes, “a cataclysmic financial decision.” Their dreams begin to clot.As it clips along, “In the Basement of the Ivory Tower” begins to read like the miserable, neurotic flip side of Norman Podhoretz’s book “Making It.” Its title could have been “Not Making It.” Professor X drives a car with a leaking radiator and one headlight; he is too strapped to buy summer clothes. “Such is the smallness of my spirit,” he writes, “that I rank my position in the universe against everyone I encounter.”When he spies a tenured professor, he’s awestruck, as if he’s seen an egret in the DMV: “He exuded calm. What must be the state of his arteries? How unobstructed must they be?”About himself and his students, he offers this: “We reek of coffee and tuna oil.” He looks around and declares, “Our presence in these evening classes is evidence that something in our lives has gone awry.” Sections of this book read like a midnight cri de coeur, a grasping after dignity and gravitas.This is meaty and oddly moving stuff, right out of Arthur Miller or David Mamet, and I wish I could say that Professor X’s prose retains its poise and elastic snap throughout. It doesn’t. By the end, like one of his students, he’s padding things out. Repetitions and infelicities pile up.Mild banalities do, too. (“There are many wonderful aspects to teaching English in college. I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.”) When he talks about teaching writing, he likes to use the word “craft” as a verb. That’s a flogging offense, professor.Yet I admired much of “In the Basement of the Ivory Tower.” It’s a clear-eyed report from what the author calls “the college of last resort.” It’s the work of a compassionate man who longs for academia to be crueler to be kinder.“Sink or swim,” he writes. “When was the last time you heard that in contemporary America?”'"
"'11-04-06,'1','Southwest has been buffeted by questions about how intensely it operates its planes. But in describing how surprised Boeing was by the accident, Mr. Richter came to the defense of the airline, Boeing’s largest customer.Noting that Southwest operates more 737s than any other airline, Mr. Richter said he thought its involvement in the accident “was just a statistical event far more than anything to do with Southwest and how they operate the aircraft.”But the new information about how soon the fatigue set in raised concerns among aviation safety experts about how much progress the industry had made on such issues, which burst into view when a large section of the roof of a 737 flown by Aloha Airlines ripped open in 1988 and a flight attendant was sucked out of the plane.John J. Goglia a member of the from 1995 to 2004, said the Southwest incident once again highlighted a problem with older aircraft that endured tens of thousands of pressurization cycles.“We’re talking about the same issues today, and we’re proposing the same fixes,” he said. “We need to take a few of these high-cycle airplanes and run them through a very vigorous inspection program and see where we can identify deficiencies, and see whether there is anything different than what the manufacturer thought there would be. But I don’t see that happening because it is expensive.”Mr. Richter, the chief engineer for Boeing’s older 737 models, told reporters that Boeing had felt so confident about the joints that it had not planned to tell airlines to inspect that part of the plane until it reached 60,000 cycles.He also said Boeing had redesigned the joints — where overlapping pieces of the outer skin are riveted together — in 1993 after weaknesses appeared in an earlier version.After the Aloha accident in 1988, Boeing introduced hundreds of modifications to several of its 737 models. It also recommended that airlines replace joints after 50,000 cycles for the more than 2,000 737s it had already produced.Mr. Richter said the changes in 1993 were expected to make a row of rivets that fasten the flaps of skin together — also known as lap joints — hold up better against the tensions caused by repeated pressurization and depressurization.When the joints are stressed by that pressure, “you get a slight rotation of the material that causes a bending in the skin, right at or adjacent to where this row of fasteners is located,” he said. “And it’s a combination of the pressure loads in flight and the bending that promotes fatigue growth at a faster rate.”Aviation experts said that Boeing might have been too confident about the durability of the new design. “When you model something you make assumptions,” Mr. Goglia said, “and if your assumptions are weak, your outcome is compromised.”Mr. Richter said that the newest generations of 737s — starting with the 600 series that entered service in 1998 and known as the Next-Generation 737 — incorporated significant design changes intended to reduce the chance of lap joint cracking. These changes reduce the amount of bending.Large cracks are rare, though they seem to be appearing with more frequency in recent years, including an incident involving a larger Boeing 757 last October in which a 1-foot by 2-foot hole opened up as the plane was flying at 31,000 feet. The F.A.A. issued an airworthiness directive in January mandating that airlines inspect their Boeing 757-200s and 300s, after it received several reports of cracking in the fuselage skin of roof panels.In July 2009, another Southwest flight between and , also a Boeing 737-300, experienced a rapid decompression when an 18-inch hole opened up while the plane was flying at 35,000 feet. The N.T.S.B., in its report on the incident, said the hole was caused by “continuous fatigue cracks initiated from multiple origins on the inner surface of the skin.” Those occurred near a step formed at the edge of aluminum panels that had been chemically milled.Mr. Richter said this was fundamentally different from the latest incident on the Southwest flight. In the latest event, the cracks apparently formed inside the holes that fastened two pieces of metal together, he said.Under an emergency directive issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday, all of the planes with more than 35,000 flight cycles must be inspected within five days. Those with 30,000 to 35,000 cycles must be examined within 20 days, and Mr. Richter said that a total of 570 planes, including 737-300s, 400s and 500s built from 1993 and 2000 — could eventually require the inspections as they reached those milestones.'"
"'11-04-06,'1','LONDON — Scotland Yard said Tuesday that two journalists had been arrested, questioned and released on bail in the renewed inquiry into a five-year-old case involving illegal hacking of celebrity voice mail by The News of the World, the gossip-driven tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch that is one of Britain’s most widely circulated newspapers.The two were “arrested on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile phone voice-mail messages,” according to a police statement, which did not name the reporters because they had not been charged. A person familiar with the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to discuss the matter, identified them as Ian Edmondson, who was fired as the tabloid’s news editor this year; and Neville Thurlbeck, the paper’s chief reporter. Scotland Yard investigators searched the paper’s newsroom while the two were being questioned, he said.The moves marked a potentially decisive turning point in an investigation that has been under way, often fitfully, since 2006, when a Scotland Yard inquiry into complaints by three members of Britain’s royal household, including Prince William and Prince Harry, uncovered a pattern of illegal hacking into the princes’ cellphone messages. Only two men have been jailed in the case, both in 2007: Clive Goodman, formerly the tabloid’s royalty reporter; and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator.A list recovered from Mr. Mulcaire’s home appeared to be a phone book of potential hacking targets, including figures from politics, entertainment and sports, but the police alerted only a handful.Criticism of the inquiry, led by Assistant Commissioner John Yates, was sharp. Last year, the Crown Prosecution Service, the agency responsible for reviewing police evidence and laying criminal charges, concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any new prosecutions. But in January, Scotland Yard entrusted the case to a new team, and the inquiry’s momentum grew.'"

In state court, Mr. Foster’s lawyers are also challenging the legality of his execution based on one of the drugs that is to be used in the lethal injection.“I’m thrilled that the Supreme Court stayed Mr. Foster’s execution, and we hope they will be looking at the issues raised, including effective habeas counsel and Mr. Foster’s claims of innocence,” Ms. Levin said. “I am also relieved that — at least today — that we will not be seeing an execution in the midst of the chaos surrounding questions about lethal injection.”Ms. Levin said she suspected that there was a link between the court’s decision to stay Mr. Foster’s execution and two other decisions the court made recently involving death row inmates.'"

"'11-04-07,'0','Mr. Abate said G.E. had completed its purchase of PrimeStar Solar, the Arvada, Colo., company that made the thin-film photovoltaic panels. G.E. said the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory recently certified that a PrimeStar solar panels manufactured at its factory in Colorado had set a 12.8 percent efficiency record for cadmium telluride technology. Conventional solar panels typically are 16 to 20 percent efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.“We believe we’ll be a cost leader, a technology leader and we’re excited about our position in a 75-gigawatt solar market over next five years,” said Mr. Abate.The global conglomerate’s entry into the highly competitive photovoltaic market is likely to prove a significant challenge to First Solar, the thin-film market leader and the dominant manufacturer of cadmium telluride panels.Also at risk are start-ups like Abound Solar, a Colorado company that in December obtained a $400 million federal loan guarantee to build factories to manufacture cadmium telluride panels.G.E.’s initial panel manufacturing capacity will be a fraction of the more than 2,300 megawatts of capacity that First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., plans to have online by the end of 2011.But Mr. Abate said that G.E.’s solar effort would parallel the rise of its wind energy business.“It’s a $6 billion platform and it was a couple of hundred million dollars in ’02,” he said of the company’s wind division. “When you look at G.E., we’re very good at scale. In ’05, we were building 10 turbines a week. By ’08, we were doing 13 a day.”But as with its wind business, G.E. will face competition from low-cost, government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers.The United States government has offered a range of subsidies to help American solar panel makers, including loan guarantees for new factories. G.E. said it was not applying for a loan guarantee but was exploring applying for state and federal manufacturing tax credits.Prices for conventional silicon-based solar modules have plummeted 50 percent in recent years and are expected to continue to fall, in large part because of the rapid expansion of Chinese manufacturing capacity. That has put particular pressure on thin-film companies to increase the efficiency of their panels and maintain a technological edge.Mr. Abate said G.E. would focus on improving the 12.8 percent efficiency of its panels as well as lowering costs.“We see our way to much higher efficiencies than that,” he said. “We probably can cut costs 50 percent over the next several years.”'"
"'11-04-07,'0','“I was awful,” Pelfrey said. “Anytime the team scores seven runs, I’ve got to win. This is the second time. I was bad last week, and I was even worse tonight. I let them down again.”In two starts, Pelfrey is 0-1 with a 15.63 earned run average. Although he pitched through pain in his shoulder last season, he said he was fine now, and he blamed his pitch selection for Wednesday’s debacle.He faced 16 batters in two-plus innings and retired only six. He gave up seven runs and eight hits, including a home run to Ryan Howard, who tied a career high with four hits and went 4 for 4 with the homer and two doubles, and also walked. Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino had a triple and a double, and Placido Polanco had three hits and three runs batted in.Phillies reliever Jose Contreras pitched the ninth for his first save in place of the injured Brad Lidge.Philadelphia scored in each of the first three innings and led, 7-0, but what started as a rout turned into something much more interesting. The Mets tied the score, 7-7, after Pelfrey left, getting two runs in the fourth and five in the fifth, but the Phillies then battered reliever Blaine Boyer the way they hammered Pelfrey.Boyer, a right-hander with a distinctive red beard, gave up two runs in the fifth and another in the sixth on a Ben Francisco home run that landed 10 rows into the left-field bleachers.After he was done pitching, Boyer went into the clubhouse and, in an act born more of pragmatism than anger, shaved off his beard, leaving just a small goatee. Although not normally superstitious, Boyer had allowed the beard to fill out and lengthen as he continued to pitch well in spring training and earned a spot in the bullpen, and his wife convinced him to keep it.“I finally had a reason to get rid of it,” he said. “I hated it.”Pelfrey’s issues may not be as easy to solve. He was not awful in the first game, but he appeared completely ill at ease Wednesday. He said he relied too much on his second-best pitches, the slider and curveball, instead of going with his strengths, his two-seam fastball and split-finger fastball, all of which are called for by catcher Josh Thole.“It’s on me,” Pelfrey said. “I went along with everything. I didn’t shake, and that’s totally on me for going along.”When Collins came out to remove Pelfrey with the bases loaded and no outs in the third inning, he stood on the mound and said that if the Mets got out of that situation, they would come back in the game.Collins was half right. The Mets did not get out of the situation; Taylor Buchholz gave up two hits that scored the three runners Pelfrey left on base.But the Mets did come back. They scored twice in the fourth inning on Angel Pagan’s two-run homer, then got five in the fifth.But Boyer faltered in the bottom of the fifth, and instead of the theme of the game being about how the scrappy Mets had refused to quit and overcame a daunting deficit, it was about how their nominal ace had once again performed poorly.“It’s only two starts,” Collins said. “You can’t overreact right now. I know he’ll do better.”'"
"'11-04-07,'0','A state-supported school for disabled students on Long Island overbilled taxpayers by $835,074 over two years, with some of the money going toward an executive’s salary and the lease on his Lexus, the state comptroller’s office said in an audit released on Wednesday.The school, the Henry Viscardi School in Albertson, Nassau County, receives about $14 million in state aid yearly, as well as charitable donations, to educate about 185 severely disabled students in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Some of the students are unable to move or speak, and many are in need of constant medical care.The school’s parent organization, Abilities!, also offers job-training, counseling and social services for the handicapped. In the period covered by the audit, the 2007-8 and 2008-9 fiscal years, Edmund L. Cortez, president of Abilities!, earned about $1.2 million in salary, bonuses, deferred compensation and benefits, and was given the use of a home on the organization’s campus, according to its tax returns for those years. Mr. Cortez, who has since retired, also accumulated about $1.36 million in deferred compensation over 12 years.The audit did not take issue with Mr. Cortez’s compensation but said Abilities! should not have billed the state for $560,407 that went to “a portion of the salary, fringe benefits, and other miscellaneous expenses” for Mr. Cortez and his secretary, since the state was already paying Viscardi’s four-person administration team to run the school.The audit also faulted Viscardi for billing the state for Mr. Cortez’s Lexus lease, which cost $550 a month; $18,913 for gas for three of Viscardi’s yellow school buses, because the state could not determine if the fill-ups had been for official school trips; $3,532 to rent a catering hall for a retirement party; and $420 worth of flowers for what was called Administrative Professional Day.The State Education Department said it would recover the money by deducting it from future payments to the school. A number of students from New York City attend Viscardi, one of 11 taxpayer-supported private schools for special education students in New York State. The annual tuition per child at Viscardi is $72,000, mostly paid for by the state and charitable donations.The school disputed the audit, saying it was proper to seek reimbursement for Mr. Cortez’s salary, and other Abilities! expenses, since the parent organization is involved in managing the school.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','A late infusion of cash from Albany has postponed the plan of the Nassau County executive, Edward Mangano, to cripple his county’s bus service, but only until the end of the year.The State Senate came up with an $8.6 million bailout for Long Island Bus. That will allow the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the system, to put off cuts on more than half of the system’s 48 routes. At least 16,000 riders would have lost service, and 200 disabled riders would have lost their paratransit service. All bets are off in January because the system still faces a financing shortfall that Mr. Mangano doesn’t want to fill.The transportation authority and Nassau County have long squabbled over financing for this essential service. Last year the county contributed $9.1 million of Long Island Bus’s $134 million operating budget. The transportation authority, which has long subsidized the money-losing bus system, wanted Nassau to kick in $24 million more to close a chronic $33 million shortfall. (It said the county has avoided paying its fair share for its own bus system the way Suffolk and Westchester Counties do. Westchester, whose bus system is as big as Nassau’s, paid almost $33 million last year for its buses.)Mr. Mangano is going in the opposite direction. He wants to cut the county’s contribution to $4.1 million, sever Long Island Bus from the transportation authority and hand it over to a private operator. Buses limit traffic congestion and keep the economy moving. They are a means of survival for thousands of riders. Instead of protecting that vital service, Mr. Mangano says a privatized system would run better for significantly less money. That’s ludicrous, as anyone will tell you who remembers the 1970s, when the failures of Nassau’s jumble of badly run private bus lines prompted the state to rescue the system.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','Golf historians may still be checking their archives, but so far the consensus is that Hogan and Nelson, Palmer and Nicklaus and Woods and Mickelson never had an exchange like this for millions around the world to instantly read, retweet and snicker.But golf may never have seen a group of players as verbose, Internet-extroverted and media savvy as the handful of Europeans charging into the top of the world rankings. While their growing eminence may or may not presage a new era of European dominance, their swelling popularity reveals the power of their thumb-twitching pastime — and how eager golf fans are for vivid personalities.Is it any surprise that Poulter, McIlroy and contemporaries Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell are fashionable picks to win the 2011 Masters that begins Thursday?To be fair, their appeal originates from more than just the use of social media. The group has also set trends in golf apparel (is there an all-orange Rickie Fowler outfit without Poulter’s all-pink duds several years earlier?). They willingly engage fans at tournaments, and generally, charm reporters with insightful interviews.Individually or collectively, they talk freely about their off-the-course lives and interests, inviting the public in for the gabfest. Compare that approach with the public bearing of the No. 1-ranked players from 1998 to 2010: Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and David Duval. Or even the stoic top Europeans of another era: Nick Faldo, Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard Langer.There was not a lot of communal repartee between those guys for all the world to see and follow.The current crop of young American PGA Tour pros are no strangers to social media or Internet exposure. Most have Web sites and/or Twitter accounts. Stewart Cink has more than a million Twitter followers. But for sheer entertainment value, the young Europeans seem to know how to be naturally affable and unceremonious.“It might be a cultural thing,” said Donald, an Englishman and the world’s fourth-ranked player. “Some of the banter that goes on between us is part of our culture. It’s the dry sense of humor.”Donald, who was educated at Northwestern University outside Chicago and now lives in Florida, added, “I don’t know if it’s the American way but it’s certainly our way.”Justin Rose, another Englishman ranked in the top 25 worldwide, said it was an outgrowth of the structure of the European golf tour.“It stems from how tough it is logistically to get around on the European tour,” Rose said Wednesday. “When you’re going from Dubai to India to China, you can’t drag the family along with you. We tend to travel on our own. As golfers we’re like this traveling band.“Twitter is an extension of the locker room.”On Monday, Poulter said he liked reaching out to his fans in every available format. That included talks with reporters until a comment he made about Woods’s chances this week was repeated to Woods a bit inaccurately and caused a minor dustup.On Wednesday, Poulter wasn’t talking. He said his Twitter account would now provide his news conference answers. A first-round lead would most likely terminate that media embargo.Woods himself on Tuesday went out of his way to say he enjoys Twitter because it lets him connect with his followers personally. But McDowell, the reigning United States Open champ and one of Woods’s more than 721,000 followers, noted on Tuesday that Woods “doesn’t put too much out there to follow.”On Wednesday evening, in one of the biggest weeks of the season, Woods’s last Twitter post was from March 31.Peter Jacobsen was one of the most charismatic and engaging pros on the PGA Tour in the 1980s and 1990s. Standing alongside the Augusta National clubhouse Wednesday afternoon, Jacobsen said he wished more golfers would emulate the carefree Europeans.“Everyone in golf is in danger of taking themselves too seriously,” he said. “I think players tend to take on the traits of the top player or top players. We had Arnold Palmer, who obviously connected with the fans. And we had Lee Trevino and Fuzzy Zoeller. It was fun.“Tiger has been more like Ben Hogan. He internalized more. But I think we’re entering a really good phase where the golfers will be more open. Hopefully, that includes the Americans.”Not far from where Jacobsen stood, Faldo was also holding court. He commended his English golfing descendants for being personable and creative. But he had another thought, too.“You know, they’re going to be playing for the very top prizes now,” Faldo said. “It might be time to stop tweeting each other and go play championship golf.“I’m joking, but it is true that it’s going to be interesting as one or the other start moving forward. When some of those majors start to be decided, we’ll have to see. That might test their sense of humor.”'"
"'11-04-07,'0','The White House welcomed the Senate votes in a statement, saying, “The administration is encouraged by the Senate’s actions today to defend the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to protect public health under the Clean Air Act.”It continued: “By rejecting efforts to roll back E.P.A.’s common-sense steps to safeguard Americans from harmful pollution, the Senate also rejected an approach that would have increased the nation’s dependence on oil, contradicted the scientific consensus on global warming, and jeopardized America’s ability to lead the world in the clean energy economy. The Clean Air Act is a vital tool in protecting our families — particularly children — from a wide variety of harmful pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease, and the administration remains committed to protecting this important law.”Congress thus remains deadlocked on the E.P.A.’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant. But efforts to handcuff the environmental agency are not likely to end here. Republican leaders are pushing to attach similar measures to the budget bill that is now being negotiated by administration and Congressional officials. If that fails, they can be expected to try again on debt ceiling or fiscal year 2012 budget bills.Mr. McConnell said that the 50 votes for his bill and the Democratic votes for the less draconian alternatives demonstrated a bipartisan majority in favor of thwarting the E.P.A.’s plans to regulate greenhouse gases.“Altogether, more than 60 senators voted in favor of four amendments that, to one degree or another, would restrain the E.P.A.’s power to regulate carbon emissions from farmers, manufacturers and power plants,” Mr. McConnell said after the vote. “We in the Senate will continue to fight for legislation that will give the certainty that no unelected bureaucrat at the E.P.A. is going to make efforts to create jobs even more difficult than the administration already has.”Wednesday’s votes came less than two years after the House passed the most ambitious climate change and energy bill ever considered in Congress, a measure that would have created a nationwide trading system to curb carbon emissions. That bill died in the Senate, and opposition to cap and trade became a successful 2010 political platform point for Tea Party groups and their financers in fossil fuel industries. Nearly all Republicans elected in the midterm election expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases.The E.P.A. has begun a program of regulating carbon dioxide emissions that will unfold over the next several years, beginning with the largest stationary emitters like power plants, factories and oil refineries.The agency is already regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks to be sold over the next five years under an agreement negotiated with states and automakers. The House bill would allow that program to proceed but bars any future regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','Soaring food prices have caused riots or contributed to political turmoil in a host of poor countries in recent months, including , and , where palm oil, a common biofuel ingredient, provides crucial nutrition to a desperately poor populace. During the second half of 2010, the price of corn rose steeply — 73 percent in the — an increase that the United Nations attributed in part to the greater use of American corn for bioethanol.“The fact that cassava is being used for biofuel in China, rapeseed is being used in , and sugar cane elsewhere is definitely creating a shift in demand curves,” said Timothy D. Searchinger, a research scholar at who studies the topic. “Biofuels are contributing to higher prices and tighter markets.”In the United States, Congress has mandated that biofuel use must reach 36 billion gallons annually by 2022. The European Union stipulates that 10 percent of transportation fuel must come from renewable sources like biofuel or wind power by 2020. Countries like China, , and have adopted biofuel targets as well.To be sure, many factors help drive up the price of food, including bad weather that ruins crop yields and high oil prices that make transportation costly. Last year, for example, unusually severe weather destroyed wheat harvests in , and China, and an infestation of the mealy bug reduced Thailand’s cassava output.Olivier Dubois, a bioenergy expert at the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said it was hard to quantify the extent to which the diversions for biofuels had driven up food prices.“The problem is complex, so it is hard to come up with sweeping statements like biofuels are good or bad,” he said. “But what is certain is that biofuels are playing a role. Is it 20 or 30 or 40 percent? That depends on your modeling.”While no one is suggesting that countries abandon biofuels, Mr. Dubois and other food experts suggest that they should revise their policies so that rigid fuel mandates can be suspended when food get low or prices become too high.“The policy really has to be food first,” said Hans Timmer, director of the Development Prospects Group of the . “The problems occur when you set targets for biofuels irrespective of the prices of other commodities.”Mr. Timmer said that the recent rise in oil prices was likely to increase the demand for biofuels.It can be tricky predicting how new demand from the biofuel sector will affect the supply and price of food. Sometimes, as with corn or cassava, direct competition between purchasers drives up the prices of biofuel ingredients. In other instances, shortages and price inflation occur because farmers who formerly grew crops like vegetables for consumption plant different crops that can be used for fuel.China learned this the hard way nearly a decade ago when it set out to make bioethanol from corn, only to discover that the plan caused alarming shortages and a rise in food prices. In 2007 the government banned the use of grains to make biofuel.Chinese scientists then perfected the process of making fuel from cassava, a root that yielded good energy returns, leading to the opening of the first commercial cassava ethanol plant several years ago.“They’re moving very aggressively in this new direction; cassava seems to be the go-to crop,” said Greg Harris, an analyst with Commodore Research and Consultancy in New York who has studied the trade.In addition to expanding cassava cultivation at home, China is buying from and as well as Thailand.Although a mainstay of diets in much of , cassava is not central to Asian diets, even though the Chinese once called it “the underground food store” because it provided crucial backup nutrition in lean harvest years. So the Chinese reasoned that making fuel with cassava would not directly affect food prices or create food shortages, at least at home. The proportion of Chinese cassava going to ethanol leapt to 52 percent last year from 10 percent in 2008.More distant or indirect impacts are considered to be likely, however. Because cassava chips have been commonly used as animal feed, new demand from the biofuels industry might affect the availability and cost of meat. In Southeast Asian countries where China is paying generously for stockpiles of cassava, farmers may be tempted to grow the crop instead of, for example, other vegetables or rice.And if China turned to Africa as a source, one of that continent’s staple food crops could be in jeopardy, although experts note that exporting cassava could also become a business opportunity.“This is becoming a more valuable cash crop,” Mr. Harris said. “The farmland is limited, so the more that is devoted to fuel, the less is devoted to food.”The Chinese demand for cassava could also dent planned biofuel production in poorer Asian nations: in the and Cambodia, developers were recently forced to suspend the construction of cassava bioethanol plants because the tuber had become too expensive.Thailand’s own nascent biofuel industry may have trouble getting the homegrown cassava it needs because it may not be able to match the prices offered by Chinese buyers, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.Biofuels development in wealthier nations has already proved to have a powerful effect on the prices and the cultivation of crops. Encouraged by national biofuel subsidies, nearly 40 percent of the corn grown in the United States now goes to make fuel, with prices of corn on the rising 73 percent from June to December 2010.Such price rises also have distant ripple effects, food security experts say. “How much does the price of corn in influence the price of corn in ? It turns out there is a correlation,” said Marie Brill, senior policy analyst at ActionAid, an international development group. The price of corn in Rwanda rose 19 percent last year.“For Americans it may mean a few extra cents for a box of cereal,” she said. “But that kind of increase puts corn out of the range of impoverished people.”Higher prices also mean that groups like the World Food Program can buy less food to feed the world’s hungry.European biofuels developers are buying large tracts of what they call “marginal land” in Africa with the aim of cultivating biofuel crops, particularly the woody bush known as jatropha. Advocates say that promoting jatropha for biofuels production has little impact on food supplies. But some of that land is used by poor people for subsistence farming or for gathering food like wild nuts.“We have to move away from the thinking that producing an energy crop doesn’t compete with food,” said Mr. Dubois of the Food and Agriculture Organization. “It almost inevitably does.”'"
"'11-04-07,'0','Mickelson does not just have confidence, he is bursting with it. And when he gets this way, he is fully capable of running the table. But before betting on Mickelson to go back to back, which has been done only by Tiger Woods (2000-1) and Jack Nicklaus (1965-66), it helps to know that there are other golfers among the field of 99 — the largest since 1965 — capable of slowing the Mickelson express.Start with Woods, who is relentlessly searching for a return to form. Woods was pounding ball after ball on the range Wednesday, alternating draws and fades and high and low ball flights. True, the longest yards in golf are those between the range and the first tee — and the distance from the new practice facility at Augusta to the first tee is about one-third of a mile — but sooner or later, Woods is likely to bring his practice game with him.He thinks it will occur this week. He smiled and nodded when asked if he was ready to win, kept smiling and nodding when asked why, and replied, when asked what part of his game was ready, “Everything.”Then there is Dustin Johnson, whose two close calls in major tournaments last year seemed to presage something big, assuming he is as impervious to mental scarring as he has said.“I know what it takes,” he said Wednesday. “I know what it’s like to be in the position.”His position in the first round will be in the 8:40 a.m. threesome along with Nick Watney, a friend and, along with Mickelson, a fellow disciple of the celebrated swing coach Butch Harmon. As Watney demonstrated in his victory at Doral in the W.G.C.-Cadillac Championship, he is not just a long hitter. He can really putt and has worked on his pitching and chipping.Also like Johnson, Watney took a fall at the P.G.A. Championship at Whistling Straits, shooting 81 in the final round, which he had entered with the tournament lead. Did he learn anything?“Whistling Straits was a very bad day on the scorecard.,” he said. “But I learned a lot that day just about how I handle situations, and I think that helped me in Doral. To beat that field, and I think I heard that everybody in the top 50 was there; so to beat that field was an honor and it kind of validated what I feel I need to address.”The winner may emerge from the European contingent, led by Martin Kaymer, the No. 1-ranked player, and Lee Westwood, last year’s Masters runner-up and the No. 2 player in the world. Luke Donald, the No. 4 player, and Paul Casey, No. 6, are also highly rated.Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, No. 5 in the rankings, is not getting much attention, probably because he said earlier this year that he does not like his chances at Augusta.As well as Mickelson is playing, he knows how many challengers he will have to overcome. He can probably rule out the 20 first-time Masters competitors, which include the six amateurs. Only one player — Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 — won in his first Masters. No amateurs have. Neither has an Australian, and there are six of them here.But beyond that? How many people figured the off-form Mickelson to win last year? Or Angel Cabrera the year before, when he prevailed in a playoff over the long shots Kenny Perry and Chad Campbell? Or Trevor Immelman in 2008 or Zach Johnson in 2007?Somewhere among the overlooked — maybe in the creative Bubba Watson or the flamboyant and motivated Ian Poulter — the next Masters champion could emerge. This Masters is wide open, and the proof will be in the playing, which replaces the talking, starting now.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','KAMPALA, Uganda — The government of Sudan accused Israel on Wednesday of carrying out a fatal airstrike on a car traveling from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.Sudan is considered a transit point in the weapons route to Hamas, the Palestinian faction that runs Gaza. Israel has not yet responded to the accusation.Sudanese officials said a missile struck the car around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, obliterating the vehicle and killing two people who were inside.The Sudanese government said Wednesday that it was sure Israel was behind the attack and that it was prepared to take the issue to the United Nations Security Council, but officials did not specify what evidence they had.A Sudanese government spokesperson, Rabie Atti, called the missile strike an attack on sovereignty. “This is piracy and should be stopped by the international community,” he said.Israel has been suspected of launching an attack on Sudanese soil before. In 2009, American officials said Israeli warplanes had bombed a convoy of trucks near Port Sudan that was believed to be carrying arms to be smuggled into Gaza. At the time, Sudanese officials said that more than 100 people were killed.'"

It was not exactly red-carpet attire, but then again this was not a splashy premiere. “Henry’s Crime” is a small indie film by Malcolm Venville. And the screening, which took place at the Landmark Sunshine Theater on the Lower East Side, was jolly and casual.Still, it drew a smattering of big names, thanks to his estimable co-stars, Vera Farmiga and James Caan, and one of the evening’s hosts, Andrew Saffir, whose intimate Cinema Society gatherings are attended by socialites and celebrities.“I’m a tremendous fan of Keanu’s,” said Stephen Baldwin, who arrived at the theater with a Bluetooth headset tucked into his left ear. “I ran into him in L.A., and we started talking cars, and he invited me to the movie.”A Baldwin aside, the crowd was long on lithe, pretty young things like the model Genevieve Morton and the actress Tika Sumpter, with a smattering of more seasoned New Yorkers like Candice Bergen and the restaurateur Drew Nieporent.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','Several Republican state senators who have been blocking a vote on extending federally funded jobless benefits said Wednesday they would relent only if the governor agreed to eliminate $300 million in federal stimulus spending. Earlier Wednesday, a senator leading the filibuster said he would allow a vote on the unemployment bill and instead try to block up to $400 million of stimulus spending. The senators later said that they wanted Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, to share responsibility for rejecting federal money — even though they could do so on their own. Mr. Nixon did not directly respond to the offer, but he said he would keep working with the Senate leadership. About 10,000 residents lost eligibility for extended jobless benefits because of the filibuster.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','Taking advantage of precious shade in the high desert is an evolutionary strategy of the chili pepper, which originated in the Sierras of northern Mexico. As summers have become hotter over the years, farmers and gardeners have begun to plant their chilies in the shade of fruit trees, which also offer protection in a sudden freeze.Mr. Nabhan, a world traveler who has written some 20 books on the culture of food and plants, is rooting himself here with perennial crops that sequester carbon and help reduce greenhouse gases. He has terraced this land, in the manner of his Middle Eastern ancestors, molding low walls out of the heavy clay soil and digging catchment basins, to slow and catch rainwater as it rushes downhill during downpours. And he has put in drip lines, fed by rainwater collected from the roof, as well as an artesian spring, to reach every plant.He is also improving the soil with organic materials like goat manure and biochar, or charcoal, locally burned, from the deadwood of his mesquite trees, which shed branches in the recent eight-year drought. (His fruit trees, near-indestructible prickly pear and agaves, survived the drought but succumbed to the freeze in February.)“The worst possible thing we can do with that sense of being overwhelmed by the severity of climate change is to just resign ourselves to being victims,” Mr. Nabhan said, setting a chile de árbol under the canopy of a desert willow. “Planting in the face of all this uncertainty is probably the most important ethical choice that we could make.”And chilies have a heat and flavor that many of us connect to in the same way we do to music, literature and our first dogs.“None of us is eating chili peppers for their protein, calories or good or bad carbohydrates,” he said. “They’re giving us pleasure and something vibrant and vital in our lives.”MR. NABHAN, 59, has worn many hats over the years, but his work, as he says, “isn’t just about conserving things.” It’s about “conserving relationships.”The grandson of a fruit peddler from Lebanon, near the Syrian border, he grew up in the Indiana sand dunes, with the spicy cooking and fresh fruits and vegetables adored by his family. Mr. Nabhan, a high school dropout, ended up with a doctorate in arid-land resources, as well as a handful of awards, including a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant.He learned to eat chilies and speak Spanish as a teenager, when he had manual-labor jobs and worked with Mexicans and Cubans. (His favorite dive served paella, and the owner had a pet European hare that would stand on its back legs and beg for jalapeños.)He went on to co-found Native Seeds Search (“search” stands for Southwestern Endangered Aridland Resource Clearinghouse), one of the first groups in the country to save and distribute the seeds of rare food crops. Its growing fields spread out in the valley below his homestead.More recently, he founded Renewing America’s Food Traditions, an alliance of groups, including the Chefs Collaborative. It is devoted to collecting and raising near-forgotten plants and animals, like heirloom apple trees or Navajo-Churro sheep. Be it chilies or lamb, “these place-based foods that have deep roots in our cultures and that are attached to particular landscapes are the essence of how people locate themselves in relation to the earth,” Mr. Nabhan said.“Chasing Chiles” captures the essence of why people continue, against all odds, to grow the food that they love: from the famous datil peppers of St. Augustine, Fla., steeped in vinegar in old whiskey bottles, to the habaneros that give pollo pibil, the Yucatán chicken dish, its kick.And though the book is an ode to the atomic, addictive flavors “that some of us need more than others,” Mr. Nabhan said, it isn’t exactly “Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in ‘Road to Zanzibar.’ ”Referring to farmers who survived Hurricane Jimena, which dumped 27 inches of rain in 24 hours along the coast north of Guaymas, a port in northern Mexico, in August 2009, he said, “It was fairly cathartic going into some of these places, where people had spent 16 hours up in a tree, or were suffering post-traumatic stress.”The travelers passed tilted powerlines and uprooted trees, finding no trace of the chiltepins that usually flourish beneath the shade of hackberry bushes on the banks of dry washes. But they did find Oscar Gonzalez, a citrus grower, and his young farmworker, Chano, who were still reeling from a night spent clinging to the branches of a palo verde tree as floodwaters ripped out fruit trees, smashed the irrigation system and carried off Chano’s house.In the Yucatán, Hurricane Gilbert not only flooded the habanero fields outside the village of Muna, but blew in viruses from Africa, which spotted and curled leaves and decreased plant yields. On the southern edge of Sonora, the wild chili crop failed almost completely during the fierce drought in 2009.And down in San Ignacio, about 60 miles from Mr. Nabhan’s house, Jesús and Casimiro Sanchez, brothers who have farmed since they could walk into the fields, were dealing with the same long drought that killed the chilies and fruit trees in Patagonia.Visiting them again, two weeks ago, Mr. Nabhan surveyed the destruction in the nursery behind their house. The February freeze had damaged a grapefruit tree, which had shed its fruit on the ground but was blooming again. A chili bush at its feet looked almost dead, but was sprouting some new leaves.“Limes and lemons were hurt the most,” Jesús Sanchez said in Spanish, as Mr. Nabhan interpreted.The tropical fruits — mangoes, avocados, guavas, papayas — that the brothers had planted in recent years in response to warmer temperatures had all died.“But the grapefruits will survive, and the figs and pomegranates were fine,” Mr. Sanchez said.Leading the way to his orchard, where stream water flows through a 350-year-old acequia, or irrigation ditch, to fruit trees and trenched rows of onions and greens, he pointed out the leaves sprouting on apple trees defoliated by the freeze that destroyed this year’s crop.The sound of the water flowing into the fields, and the dappled light, evoked a feeling of paradise as ancient as the first Persian gardeners who created rills, or water channels, in the desert.Mr. Sanchez offered his visitors dried chiltepins, smiling as their eyes watered and they croaked, “Muy picante, muy sabroso.”Then he gave them some seeds.CHILIES evolved in hot, dry climates, so they are drought-tolerant and can take high temperatures. They are also ideal for pots, so these shrubby plants can spend the winter in a sunny room or greenhouse.A few of Gary Paul Nabhan’s favorites are listed below, but many more — and their stories — can be found in “Chasing Chiles,” which he co-wrote.The chiltepin, or wild chili of the Sonoran Desert, is hard to start from seed and will die if overwatered. Its pea-size red fruit are packed with heat. “And yet its fire quickly burns out,” the book says. “You are left with a lingering taste of minerals, the thirsty desert earth itself.”If growing from seed, start chiltepins indoors, setting pots or trays on a heat mat or warm surface (like the top of your refrigerator) until they germinate. Then give them plenty of sun and move them into bigger pots, after the seedlings develop their first true leaves. Wait until night temperatures warm to 55 degrees before moving the pots outdoors or planting in the ground. Chilies also appreciate being watered from below, with drip lines or soaker hoses. If watering by hand, do not douse them with cold water from the hose; let it warm up a bit in a barrel or bucket.The chile de árbol, which thrives in the semi-shade of a tree or shrub, is a red, pungent chili about two to four inches long. It’s terrific for salsa.Seeds for both chilies are available through Native Seeds Search, (866) 622-5561 or nativeseeds.org.The fish pepper, which is thought to have been brought to this country from the Caribbean by African slaves, is a favorite with Chesapeake Bay folk, who use it in fish, crab and shrimp dishes. The two-foot plants have striking variegated foliage and medium-hot green fruit that turn bright red as they ripen. Seeds are sold through the Seed Savers Exchange, (563) 382-5990 or seedsavers.org.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','When is a rug a work of art? Maybe when it’s priced at more than $35,000.That’s what the manufacturer of the Circus rug, designed by Fernando and Humberto Campana, recently concluded.The $35,575 hemp rug, which is six and a half feet in diameter and covered in dolls handmade in Brazil, was introduced a year ago at the furniture fair in Milan. It was produced in an edition of 10, by Nodus, an Italian company.But it wasn’t until last month, when the company shipped the rugs to Perimeter Art & Design, a gallery in Paris, that the first one sold.“It was so new, it took time to be understood,” said Andrea Galimberti, the company’s president. “At the beginning it is a rug — and now it’s an art piece.”For the Campana brothers, however, it’s more of a time capsule. The rug was inspired by childhood memories of growing up in the small Brazilian town of Brotas, said Fernando Campana, where “we used to play circus in the backyard.”The remaining nine rugs are available at Perimeter Art & Design, in Paris.

"'11-04-07,'0','Take, for instance, At Bat’s anchor feature, the field view, where you can watch an animated, pitch-by-pitch version of every game as it progresses.Like last year, the screen shows the action from the home-plate umpire’s point of view. This year, though, MLB.com used images from the Sony PlayStation 3 game, MLB 11 The Show, to display a much more realistic view of the stadium. Later this season, an MLB.com spokesman, Matthew Gould, said, that realism will extend to the batting stances of individual players.The improvements are not limited to eye candy, though. One of my favorite elements of last year’s At Bat for iPad was the animated pitch-location feature, which gets a boost this year.Each pitch still arcs toward viewers in the same path, and with the same termination point, of the on-field pitch. Likewise, the ball’s path is color-coded to denote the pitch type, and when the pitch reaches the plate, a label appears. (“91 MPH Four-Seam Fastball,” for instance.)But this year, if you click on that label, the screen shows a side view of the pitch, along with the pitcher’s release point, where the pitch broke and how many inches it broke. It’s a baseball geek’s dream, and it exemplifies a level of software showboating that At Bat pulls off consistently on the iPad.Avid baseball fans who own an iPad, and who skip this app, are making a mistake.That’s especially true this month, since At Bat is giving away live video of every out-of-market game. On Apple devices, the video is bolstered by optional on-screen graphics showing information about every player on the field.Those who use the app on the phone will notice some shortcomings though.The fancy pitch-path feature, for instance, is only on the iPad, and the stadium graphics are much more rudimentary on smaller devices.Still, smartphone users can take solace in the fact that they can still hear game coverage from either team’s broadcast service.Those who attend live games with an iPhone or iPod Touch or Android phone get a bonus, in the form of the app’s At the Ballpark feature. Apple users receive detailed maps of the site, video highlights and, depending on the ballpark, discounts on concessions. (Android users will see the interactive maps later this season, Mr. Gould said. As is the case with live video, BlackBerry users do not receive the At the Ballpark feature.)If such amenities aren’t worth $15 to you, MLB.com also offers At Bat Lite free. Unfortunately, unlike other free, advertising-supported versions of paid apps, this one includes few features from the paid version.Users see a league scoreboard, video highlights and team-specific information, for instance, but not much more. A better choice might be a popular all-purpose app like ESPN ScoreCenter (free on Android and Apple). Unlike MLB.com’s At Bat Lite, ScoreCenter will notify you of your favorite team’s results, and that includes sports other than baseball.Fantasy-baseball participants may buy At Bat as an accessory to their league contests, but the app won’t do much for fans who are following a long list of players from various teams. Good, and free, alternatives are Fantasy News Center and ESPN Fantasy Baseball 2011, both on Android and Apple, while Apple users should also consider Fantasy Baseball Monster ’11 ($3 on iPhone and $5 on iPad $5).Fantasy baseball contestants are accustomed to spending much bigger sums to support their habit. Many casual fans will have a hard time spending $15 on an app like At Bat. If they do, though, they should consider one last impulse buy — Pennant.This iPad-only app offers a batter-by-batter recap of every Major League Baseball game played from 1952 to 2010, along with great graphics. If you vaguely recall a game you attended in your youth, in which your hero homered, you can scan through the season and recount the circumstances surrounding his big hit.Pennant’s developer said an iPhone version of the app would most likely appear before the all-star break, followed by an Android version.So if your favorite team is out of the running by then and you can’t bear to follow their late-summer demise, Pennant will offer some retrospective solace.The newest version of Zillow now lets BlackBerry users deepen their real estate voyeurism activities, with quick property value lookups. Previously available only to iPhone and Android users, Zillow is free. ... Room 77, free for iPhone, offers information on specific hotel rooms in 18 cities, so you can find a spot suited to your preferences. ...

"'11-04-07,'0','SHANGHAI — The departing American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., criticized China’s human rights record on Wednesday in some of the sharpest public comments here yet by a United States official since the Chinese government began a crackdown on dissent this year.Using a high-profile annual lecture on Chinese-American relations to make his final public address as ambassador, Mr. Huntsman said bluntly that prominent Chinese activists had been unfairly detained or jailed, naming Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence for “subversion,” and Ai Weiwei, the Beijing artist who was taken into custody on Sunday.Mr. Huntsman also accused China of wrongly imprisoning Xue Feng, an American geologist who was gathering information on the oil industry and accused of stealing state secrets.“The United States will never stop supporting human rights because we believe in the fundamental struggle for human dignity and justice wherever it may occur,” said Mr. Huntsman, who leaves his diplomatic post this month amid speculation he may seek the Republican nomination for president.Foreign diplomats normally avoid such open criticism of Chinese policies and actions here, to avoid complicating relations and embarrassing top officials. Usually, that restraint is especially in play in forums drawing an elite domestic audience or major media attention.But Mr. Huntsman’s speech, made one day after the State Department called for Mr. Ai’s immediate release, praised the artist and other prominent activists, saying they “challenged the Chinese government to serve the public in all cases at all times.”'"

"'11-04-07,'0','“We are still looking for at the least 150 people in the sea, but we fear there could be even more than that,” said Cmdr. Valerio Alessandro, a spokesman for the Italian port authorities. He later revised that number to 250, and he said about 20 bodies had been seen in the water.According to the International Organization for Migration, the boat left Libya carrying migrants and asylum seekers from Somalia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Chad and Sudan. The organization said that an estimated 40 women and 5 children had been on board, and that only 2 women had been rescued so far.Early Wednesday morning, an Italian Coast Guard patrol boat reached the stricken vessel after those aboard, using a satellite phone, had sought help from the Maltese maritime authorities, Commander Alessandro said.Just as the coast guard boat reached the vessel, which was taking on water, its engine stalled. Strong waves and panicking passengers caused the vessel to rock, people began falling overboard and it capsized.Italian Coast Guard officials were using aircraft and boats to search for possible survivors, with help from the financial police, Commander Alessandro said.Lying in a clinic in Lampedusa, Peter Hougot, 29, from Cameroon, recounted the crossing from Libya. “My 24-year-old girlfriend died, and I lost her and my friend who was traveling with us,” Mr. Hougot said.He said he had been working as a house painter in Libya for the past two years and had paid $400 to a middleman to cross the Mediterranean to Italy.He said that he had refused to join a militia fighting for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and that in response he was told “to go out to go to Italy.”In a television interview, one survivor said he had paid a Somali group for passage to Italy from Libya.“The survivors are all in a state of shock,” said Simona Moscarelli, an official for the International Organization for Migration who was acting as an interpreter for the rescued migrants and the police in Lampedusa on Wednesday.“One man told me he had lost his 1-year-old son. One of the two surviving women told me how she had lost her husband,” Ms. Moscarelli added in a statement.The boat capsized about 39 miles from Lampedusa, which since January has attracted thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing unrest in North Africa. Some of the migrants from the boat said in Italian television interviews that they had come from the western port city of Zuwarah, near the Tunisian border.Last week, Lampedusa was on the brink of collapse, running low on food and water, with thousands of migrants sleeping in the open air. In response, Italy transferred many of them to makeshift tent camps on the Italian mainland, from which a number of them easily escaped and tried to make their way to other parts of Italy and Europe to seek work.The spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, Laura Boldrini, said the shipwreck underscored the need for better coordination in identifying the migrants arriving in Italy from North Africa.So far, most have been Tunisians seeking work, Ms. Boldrini said, but in recent days more boats have been coming from Libya and could contain refugees. “At the moment, this has been very limited, but we have to be ready for the possibility they will come,” she said.On Tuesday, the Italian interior minister, Roberto Maroni, signed an agreement with the Tunisian government to try to block the flow of migrants from that country. The Tunisian authorities will accept the repatriation of new arrivals, and Italy will provide Tunisia with boats and off-road vehicles to put into effect the border controls that have almost ceased since Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted from the Tunisian presidency in a popular revolt in January.Italy said it would also grant some Tunisian arrivals six-month temporary residence permits.Critics have objected that the agreement does not set any dates or provide practical details on how the repatriation would take place. In a statement on Wednesday on the Italian Interior Ministry’s Web site, Mr. Maroni expressed satisfaction with the renewed cooperation between Italy and Tunisia, but he also said the agreement “will now have to be implemented.”'"
"'11-04-07,'0','In a statement the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, said Portugal’s request “will be processed in the swiftest possible manner, according to the rules applicable.”If the pattern of previous bailouts is repeated, a team of officials will be sent to Lisbon to discuss the conditions of a bailout, which will then need to be agreed upon by European finance ministers. That, however, will probably not happen for several weeks.Caught in a political crisis and facing tough refinancing hurdles, Portugal has also been hit by repeated downgrades by credit-rating agencies, sending yields this week on Portuguese government debt to their highest levels since the introduction of the euro.Mr. Sócrates, who had been governing without a parliamentary majority, resigned last month after lawmakers rejected his latest austerity package. To break the political deadlock, Portugal is set to hold a general election on June 5.In a separate televised address, Pedro Passos Coelho, the leader of the main Social Democratic opposition party, said that he backed the decision to seek outside help.Adding to the pressure on the government, Portuguese banking executives warned this week that they did not want to take on more sovereign debt, urging the government to negotiate a bridge loan with its European partners.Alongside that of Portuguese banks and companies, “the rating of the country has fallen like never before,” Mr. Sócrates said. “This is a particularly serious situation for our country.”European ministers agreed last May to provide 80 billion euros in loans to Greece over three years as part of a package in which the International Monetary Fund provided an additional 30 billion euros. In November, they also agreed to a rescue package worth up to 85 billion euros for the Irish government.Last month, leaders of the euro zone countries agreed to cut the interest rate charged Greece to help ease its debt burden. No such agreement was made with Ireland because of Dublin’s refusal to accede to French and German requests to raise its low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent.For Portugal, the emergency financing will ensure that it can meet its 20 billion euros of borrowing requirements for the year. But it is likely to set off debate over what conditions will be tied to any rescue package, at a time when Portugal struggles with record unemployment and an economy that is likely to contract 1.3 percent this year, according to a recent forecast from the Bank of Portugal.Further, the government’s recent effort to push through an austerity package combining more spending cuts and tax increases prompted Portuguese residents to take to the streets last month in a sign of rising social unrest.“Outside intervention will be positive for our treasury but could be a disaster for our economy,” said Diogo Ortigão Ramos, a specialist on fiscal legislation at a law firm, Cuatrecasas, Gonçalves Pereira. “Whoever forms the next government, our creditors will have the final word.”Mr. Sócrates said that the decision to seek help was taken amid expectations that market conditions would continue to worsen for Portugal.Analysts suggested that markets would respond cautiously on Thursday given the uncertainty surrounding the terms of any bailout.“I expect that the news will bring only limited relief” to the yield spread between Portuguese bonds and those of Germany, the reference securities in the euro zone, said Tullia Bucco, economist at UniCredit, adding that “it will not refrain the European Central Bank from delivering a 25 basis point interest rate hike” this week.Earlier on Wednesday, Portugal sold Treasury bills at a much higher cost than last month. It sold 455 million euros (about $646 million) in one-year Treasury bills at an average yield of 5.9 percent, compared with 4.33 percent yield when Portugal last sold such bills on March 16.The national debt agency also sold 550 million euros of six-month bills at an average yield of 5.12 percent, compared with a yield of 2.98 percent at a previous auction on March 2. The Treasury bill sale came after Moody’s on Tuesday cut the sovereign rating of Portugal for the second time in a month. On Wednesday, Moody’s also downgraded by one or more notches the senior debt and deposit ratings of seven Portuguese banks.'"
"'11-04-07,'0','RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — After a rebuff last month from King Abdullah, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates met privately with him for an hour and a half on Wednesday in an attempt to thaw ice-cold relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States.Mr. Gates described the one-on-one session with the Saudi ruler to reporters as an “extremely cordial, warm meeting,” but his comments lasted barely a minute before he was whisked away by aides. Mr. Gates did say that he declined to raise with the king one of the most contentious issues separating the two countries: the Saudi decision to ignore President Obama last month and send in troops to crush an uprising in neighboring Bahrain.No one from the American side was in the meeting, and King Abdullah was accompanied only by the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, who served as the interpreter. Mr. Gates’s aides had said they expected the meeting to be long and tense, but Mr. Gates, a former director of the C.I.A., had not briefed them on any particulars as of Wednesday night in Riyadh.Relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia are in their worst state since the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, but the Obama administration is trying to quietly manage the rupture. To that end, Mr. Gates and his aides spoke publicly before and after the meeting of the countries’ common ground: the fear of an ascendant Iran and the United States’ recent $60 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia.“I think the relationship is in a good place,” Mr. Gates told reporters. “We talked about developments all over the region. Obviously we talked about Iran.”The United States and Saudi Arabia say they are concerned that Iran’s Shiite rulers will take advantage of the revolts sweeping the Middle East to foment Shiite movements against Sunni rulers, as the Saudi royal family fears may happen in Bahrain. “We already have evidence that the Iranians are trying to exploit the situation in Bahrain,” Mr. Gates said, repeating earlier assertions without providing details. “And we also have evidence that they are talking about what they can do to try and create problems elsewhere as well.”'"

Mr. Walcott began exerting more influence on school administration while she struggled to conquer a steep learning curve.He stood by her side in her first televised interview, pitching in when she had trouble with policy questions. He came out to defend the ’s efforts to mobilize families around political issues. And he started attending meetings, a rarity in Mr. Klein’s tenure, at times emerging from behind the curtains to talk to her senior aides on the stage.“It was no secret he was running the show,” said James Devor, president of the community education council in ’s District 15. “I just don’t know if he can be independent enough to run the schools.”Apart from official responsibilities, Mr. Walcott, the highest-ranking African-American official at City Hall, has been a sort of ambassador for Mayor . When the mayor abolished community school boards, it was Mr. Walcott who set out to convince angry parents that the move was not meant to shut them out. When a young bridegroom, , was shot dead by a group of police officers outside a Queens strip club in 2006, he consoled Mr. Bell’s mother at the hospital.In a hard-charging administration focused on measuring progress through numbers in virtually everything it does, he has been a mellow presence, largely accessible to parents and politicians, though not necessarily always responsive.“My experience has been that he does call back and will say, ‘Yes, yes, yes,’ but follow-up is wanting,” said one City Council member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to rile the administration.He has close ties to Councilman Robert Jackson, chairman of the Council’s Education Committee, and to Ernest A. Logan, president of the principals’ union.The relationships are bound to be tested under his new post.“He will have to convince principals, parents and teachers that he’s there to support them and not necessarily to defer to certain political interests,” said Eric Nadelstern, a former deputy chancellor who is now a professor of educational leadership at Teachers College.Mr. Walcott still lives in the same neighborhood where he grew up, Cambria Heights, a black middle-class enclave in southeastern Queens. His four children graduated from city public schools, and one of his two grandsons attends them. (The other is still too young.)Mr. Walcott graduated from Francis Lewis High School in Queens, and has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in education from the University of Bridgeport in , and a master’s in social work from .He spent two years as a kindergarten teacher in Queens, and eventually joined the New York Urban League, where he was president and chief executive for 12 years. Arva Rice, the current chief executive, said that Mr. Bloomberg met Mr. Walcott during his first mayoral campaign, and took a liking to him and the apple-shaped pin on his lapel, bearing an equals sign.She relayed a story she said she had heard from Mr. Bloomberg: “Bloomberg asked Dennis, what is that pin? Dennis told him it represents equality for all New Yorkers.” Mr. Bloomberg then inquired if he could wear the pin, and they made a wager. If Bloomberg won the election, “he’d get to keep the pin, but if he lost, he’d have to give it back,” she said. “He ended up not only taking the pin but also the C.E.O. as well.”On Thursday, in a brief address to Education Department staff members, Mr. Walcott reiterated his support of the mayor’s education agenda, including the push to close low-performing schools.“We have a collective responsibility to continue the reforms we’ve started over the last nine years,” he said.'"

If the show could be said to be about anything, it’s about improvising and vamping your way out of a tight corner.Consider some of the dramatis personae who assemble in New York on the deck of a London-bound luxury liner: Reno Sweeney, the onetime evangelist who has become a naughty nightclub star (imagine Aimee Semple McPherson transformed into Texas Guinan); Moonface Martin (Mr. Grey), a gangster fleeing the law by pretending to be a priest; and Billy Crocker (Colin Donnell) a young stockbroker who winds up pretending to be a sailor (and later a gangster) to pursue a lovely debutante.That would be Hope Harcourt (Laura Osnes) whose nouveau pauvre mother, Evangeline (Ms. Walter), has betrothed her daughter to the wealthy Lord Evelyn Oakleigh (Mr. Godley), in a bid to restore the family fortunes. In the meantime the ship’s Captain (Walter Charles) is desperately looking for a few famous names to parade before his celebrity-hungry passengers. (The first line of the show’s title song is “Times have changed,” but in some ways they obviously haven’t.)How these mixed nuts collaborate with and fool one another involves much strutting of assorted, sometimes tedious, comic styles. As a nearsighted Wall Street tycoon (and Crocker’s boss), Mr. McMartin, that invaluable Broadway veteran, brings a delicious giddiness to elderly lust and Ivy League juvenility. Playing an English aristo in love with American slang, a very game Mr. Godley (“Private Lives” on Broadway) makes merry with malapropisms. Jessica Stone is a salty treat as a sailor-chasing gangster’s moll. And Mr. Grey does his time-tested combination of music-hall shtick and “little ol’ me” puckishness that became his post-“Cabaret” signature when he appeared in “George M!” 43 years ago.The jokes and double entendres tend to be of the collegiate variety show ilk. But even when they misfired, I kept grinning because I knew that they were pointing the way to yet another knockout production number. For that is where this revival comes into its glory.Ms. Marshall, whose career as a director-cum-choreographer has included sky-scraping highs (“The Pajama Game”) and bottom-scraping lows (“Grease”), is on top again here. She has clearly made a close study of 1930s film musicals and rings diverse variations on styles made famous by Astaire, Hermes Pan and Busby Berkeley. But whereas earlier Broadway evocations of the same period, including “42nd Street” (1980 and 2001) and “Never Gonna Dance” (2003), had a bottled, artificial quality, this “Anything Goes” exudes the effervescence of a freshly poured gin fizz.For the pas de deux between the young lovers, Billy and Hope, Ms. Marshall reinvents the supple chemistry of Astaire and Rogers. When they’re only talking or even singing, Billy and (especially) Hope are about as exciting as most moony musical ingénues are. But when Mr. Donnell and Ms. Osnes go cheek to cheek, it’s with a yearning, melting elegance that makes you believe in love as a state of grace.Of course it doesn’t hurt that what they’re dancing to are “Easy to Love” and “It’s De-Lovely.” There’s no underestimating the abiding infectiousness of Porter’s best songs. (You may recall some from other shows; Porter wrote numbers that could fit comfortably into many different productions.)And when Ms. Marshall turns up the heat for big ensemble interpretations of “Blow, Gabriel, Blow” and “Anything Goes,” watch out. Tapping, shimmying, twirling and writhing, the dancers combine military discipline with white-hot sensuality, and the dopey promise of all those insinuating one-liners is more than fulfilled.It’s Ms. Foster who leads these numbers, both as a singer and as a dancer. And her triple mastery of words, music and moves is unmatched by any performer on Broadway at the moment. It’s not just that she nails every step, note and joke. It’s the attitude with which she does so — an aw-shucks kind of casualness coupled with a dizzy exhibitionist’s delight.Her pleasure in her material creates a sheen that illuminates everyone around her. Mr. Donnell, Mr. Grey and Mr. Godley are never better than in their duets with Ms. Foster, energetic competitions in putting over some of Porter’s cleverest lyrics.Even tapping frenziedly with a chorus line, she seems to be conducting a happy, quippy dialogue with her fellow dancers, an implicit call-and-response between a perfectly in-sync star and a great ensemble. (“Can you top this?” “Oh, yes I can.”) At such moments Ms. Foster’s Reno becomes an evangelist of musical-comedy joy. When she turns her toothy, triumphant smile on the audience there’s no doubt that she’s made many converts.Music and lyrics by Cole Porter; original book by P. G.

"'11-04-08,'0','Though they may say their development efforts are designed to help them compete with the two coasts for companies, they often end up fighting over companies already in the region.South Dakota, for example, has long run radio and print advertisements in Minnesota boasting of its far lower tax burden, recruiting businesses with names like Twin City Fan. Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota argued that it was usually more effective to recruit businesses from neighboring states because they already knew the region.“Rather than swim upstream with someone who has negative connotations because of a lack of knowledge, it’s easier,” he said.This approach is often criticized by economists like Timothy J. Bartik, who studies state and local economic development policies for the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.“It’s a little bit of a zero sum game,” Mr. Bartik said. “Because one part gains and the other part loses. And the gains are much more modest than the losses.”Leaders in some Midwestern border cities like Omaha, Sioux City and Fargo insist that they have found ways to work together. But the battle over jobs continues with particular intensity in Kansas City, where decades of rapid growth have transformed the Kansas suburbs into successful economic rivals of the Missouri downtown.AMC, which is being wooed by both sides, has grown into one of this city’s largest companies since it started with a single theater downtown in 1920, just blocks from its current headquarters. But a troublesome air-conditioning system prompted the company to search for a newer base.Kansas has offered a package of incentives that includes a 10-year tax rebate of more than $40 million. Missouri, unable to match it, hopes AMC’s deep roots will keep the company where it is out of loyalty. Both Kansas’ governor, Sam Brownback, and Missouri’s, Jay Nixon, have lobbied personally in recent weeks.Mr. Lopez has not decided on his next move, but he noted that lavish incentives from Kansas could not be easily brushed aside. He was skeptical, too, about any broader benefit to an area where the lives of most of his employees already extend comfortably to both sides of the border.“Will there be any net improvement to the region?” he asked. “Probably not.”Mark Funkhouser, Kansas City’s mayor, is a vocal critic of what he calls “this recent jobs poaching expedition,” complaining that the efforts drain time and money that could be spent on services like education and infrastructure that should be used to attract residents and businesses from outside the region.“What politicians are doing is creating the illusion that they are creating jobs by short-term fixes that actually weaken the region’s ability to compete,” he said.But Brent Miles, president of the economic development council in bordering Wyandotte County, which includes the much smaller Kansas City, Kan., said he did not recruit from across state lines unless companies or their representatives initiated the contact. Indeed, Nick Jordan, the Kansas secretary of revenue, said there was a “nonpoaching agreement” signed by the two states’ governors (though the document could not be located).Those claims are widely dismissed by people who say that a single exploratory call by a company can set off a full-court-press recruiting drive.Though the flow of companies has gone both ways over the years, there is no dispute that Kansas has been far more successful of late.Of the 53 companies that have received state tax incentives to move into Kansas since the 2009 fiscal year, 45 have been from Missouri, according to a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce. During that period, just one company moved from Kansas to Missouri, according to Missouri figures.In Wyandotte County, Mr. Miles said, 133 of the 156 “new jobs” from out of state last year were from Missouri, using a phrase that has rankled those who say the same employees usually just alter their commutes.“Our definition is new to us,” Mr. Miles explained. “It is a new job, obviously, to the State of Kansas. When you’re tax driven, that’s important. Now the State of Kansas gets the tax instead of the State of Missouri.”Art Hall, director of the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business, said the debate over such programs was difficult to referee because much of the information about the incentives was not public. He was doubtful that such programs made economic sense. “What you’ve really done is set up a situation to be abused by businesses,” Mr. Hall said.That has been the experience of David Frantze, a prominent real estate lawyer in Kansas City, who said that when he had a client looking for office space in the metro area, he immediately sent requests to both states asking about potential packages.“It’s horrible public policy,” he said. “But as long as it’s the law of the land, as a lawyer you have the responsibility to get the best deal for your client.”A growing number of prominent community members on both sides favor a border zone, in which states would be allowed to offer incentives only for new jobs, rather than those that are simply being relocated within it.Such plans have been often floated without success. But an informal group of civic leaders, including Don Hall Jr., the chief executive of Hallmark, based in Kansas City, has been pushing more aggressively for a détente.“Our success as a regional city is not based on one side or the other, but so many of our mechanisms for competing are really aimed at each other,” Mr. Hall said.John Vratil, a state senator who represents the Kansas side of the metro area, agreed that the efforts were a distraction but had a more fatalist attitude. “It’s just an inherent aspect of the free market,” he said.That is why Jeff Kaczmarek, head of the Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City, is urging the Missouri Legislature to expand tax incentives to make it easier to compete.“From a philosophical perspective it makes no sense, but the question is: Is the State of Kansas going to unilaterally disarm, and until that happens why would Missouri unilaterally disarm?” he asked.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','It’s not a backstage comedy, exactly, since the setting is Frankie & Johnnie’s, the well-known theater-district steakhouse, but “Meeting Spencer” is all about showbiz machinations, cogitations and aspirations. The film, though, directed by Malcolm Mowbray, isn’t quite savvy enough to compete with the slyest entries in that genre or madcap enough to run with the zaniest.Jeffrey Tambor does good work as Harris Chappell, the once-noted director at the center of the story, who is hoping that the final work from a now-dead writer will turn into his Broadway comeback. But he needs financing. He is meeting his friend Didi (Melinda McGraw) for dinner and is expecting her to bring along a deep-pocketed boyfriend, but things don’t go remotely according to plan. Also invited to the dinner is Spencer (Jesse Plemons of “Friday Night Lights”), the son of a friend to whom Harris owes a favor.The screenplay is credited to three writers (Andrew Kole, Andrew Delaplaine and Scott Kasdin), which may account for the inconsistencies in tone. Harris is refreshingly not the high-strung-director stereotype, but some of the secondary roles have been rendered as annoying caricatures, especially Nikki (Jill Marie Jones), a reporter who missed the class about journalistic ethics.

"'11-04-08,'0','PARIS — Bernard Arnault, the man who runs LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, usually gets what he wants, including, most recently, the Italian jewelry company Bulgari, which he purchased for an estimated $5.3 billion.But a neighborhood group in Paris has put a stop to Mr. Arnault’s major vanity project — a Frank Gehry-designed museum to sit on the northern edge of the Bois de Boulogne and house Mr. Arnault’s lavish collection of contemporary art.This being France, and Mr. Arnault being a sort of Ozymandias, he is likely to get his pyramid anyway — even if it requires Parliament to pass a special law overriding the courts.The $143 million museum project, run by the Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation, a legally separate entity from LVMH, would be Mr. Gehry’s second project in Paris. The first, built more than 15 years ago, sat empty for 9 years and then was turned into the Cinémathèque Française. While that building is considered tame in its urban setting, this newer one will stand out in the park, inescapable — with a bent glass roof, like an enormous 150,000-square-foot dress flowing over the simple walls beneath. Much of the art, which belongs to Mr. Arnault and LVMH, is worthy; the museum itself, being built with no public funds on concessionary land from the city of Paris, will revert to the city in 55 years.The group that seeks to block the museum — and that received a court order on Jan. 20 annulling the museum’s 2007 building permit — is hardly representative of Paris’s huddled poor. It is a neighborhood association in a wealthy neighborhood, bordering one of the city’s loveliest parks and playgrounds.The group, known as the Coordination for the Protection of the Bois de Boulogne and its Surroundings, has a simple argument: the park is intended for the public, the museum is next to a children’s playground, and the building itself violates the rules governing the park by blocking a paved roadway that should be open to the public. In addition, they say, the 150-foot-high building violates height requirements by cleverly using an architectural subterfuge, creating split-level mezzanines inside that are not formally “floors,” to get around a legal restriction banning buildings higher than two floors.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','Mr. Wall said the board, as part of a complete financial review, was also examining ways to reduce costs, including possible staff cuts and salary reductions.Contracts with the chorus and orchestra expire this spring, and although there have been preliminary discussions, formal negotiations have yet to begin, said George Steel, the company’s general manager and artistic director.Mr. Wall said, “Everything is going to be discussed and is on the table, and everybody is going to have to participate.”He said ticket sales fell “considerably short” of projections for last fall, when City Opera presented Leonard Bernstein’s “A Quiet Place” and Strauss’s “Intermezzo.” Expectations were lowered, he said, for the three spring productions: “L’Elisir d’Amore” by Donizetti; “Monodramas,” one-acts by John Zorn, Morton Feldman and Schoenberg; and “Séance on a Wet Afternoon” by Stephen Schwartz. Company officials declined to provide attendance figures.Mr. Wall suggested that the company could have done a better job of marketing, given the disparity between the high quality of performances and the disappointing audiences. “It’s our job to sell our wonderful company,” he said. “If we’re not doing it, shame on us. It’s a question I ask around here: How can this be?”Mr. Wall, a former vice chairman of Philip Morris International in Switzerland, was a City Opera board member from 2001 to 2008, and he returned as chairman at the beginning of this year.City Opera’s latest struggles, compounded by the weak economy, which has hurt most cultural institutions, began after the appointment of Gerard Mortier as general manager. Mr. Mortier resigned in 2008, even before officially taking over. The company halted operations except for concerts for the 2008-9 season, when its home, the Koch Theater, underwent renovation, pushing down revenue to $6 million (from $33 million the year before) while fixed costs remained. Last season’s budget was about $31 million and had a $4.6 million shortfall.Revenues this season were about $22 million, Mr. Wall said. “I’m looking at a balanced budget on the order of that area,” he added.Endowment money was used to make up the deficits, pushing the fund down to around $9 million or $10 million. Mr. Wall said he hoped to raise that figure up to about $200 million. “It’s a lot to do,” he said, “but it is something that can be done.”In an interview in February, Mr. Wall also said he hoped to bring the number of board members, now 34, to 60, and to double the annual donation each trustee makes to $100,000. He said on Thursday that he had not yet addressed the donation issue.Mr. Steel, who succeeded Mr. Mortier, said he was gratified by the “tremendous artistic success” of the last two seasons. He said he had proceeded with some planning but declined to give details.“The parameters for next season will be set by the board when they finish their work,” said Mr. Steel, who has long said that the right range of productions is 8 to 10. When asked for a ballpark number of operas he hoped to put on in 2011-12, he said, “Between one and a thousand.”'"
"'11-04-08,'0','That is, it should be noted, not the same as saying the financial statements were wrong. It is possible that the audit firm did not do enough work to know if the statements were accurate but that they would have been acceptable even to a proper audit.Moreover, as Mr. Doty noted, “Auditors were not charged with enforcing good risk management practices at financial institutions.” But they were supposed to make sure the statements reflected the conditions at the time. That appears not to have happened at Lehman Brothers, at least when it came to leverage, and it might not have happened at other banks.What’s worse, the problems seem to be continuing.In the wake of the financial crisis, no accounting issue has been more critical than the valuation of financial assets. In some cases, banks are now required to report the fair value — normally the market value — of securities they own. That is not easy for securities that rarely trade, and it was made all the harder by the complexity of some securities that Wall Street invented during the boom years. Banks claim, with some justification, that markets became unduly fearful at the height of the crisis, and that market values fell too low.Investors and regulators could, if they chose, make allowances for depressed markets. But they need to be able to compare banks with one another, and to do that they need to have confidence that financial statements are comparable.But the accounting oversight board does not think that has happened. In the board’s report of its 2009 inspection of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which concerns 2008 audits conducted at the height of the financial crisis, the board wrote that “in four audits, due to deficiencies in its testing of fair values of investment securities and/or derivatives, the firm failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its audit opinion.”It had similar complaints about each of the other members of the Big Four — KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.Unfortunately for investors, the board has not revealed the names of any clients involved.Nor do the auditors appear to have gotten everything right in later audits, at least in Mr. Doty’s view.“Although the 2010 reporting cycle is not yet complete, so far P.C.A.O.B. inspectors have continued to identify significant issues related to the valuation of complex financial instruments, among other areas,” he said, adding that the “inspectors have also identified more issues than in prior years.”In 2002, when the auditing firms had been humiliated by audit failures, their efforts to prevent any regulation failed, but they did win one crucial victory in the details of the Sarbanes-Oxley law. The oversight board must keep secret its most critical assessments of audits unless a firm fails to respond to the criticism. And the board’s disciplinary actions remain secret until they are resolved by the board and the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled on any appeal.It is as if the fact a man was suspected of robbing a bank had to be kept secret until after he was not only convicted but failed in his appeal.That secrecy was justified as necessary to protect reputations that could be tarnished by charges that might later be disproved. In practice, board officials complain, it has led to stalling tactics by firms that figure they can avoid negative publicity indefinitely. The board has asked Congress to change the law, but that seems unlikely.In his speech this week, Mr. Doty said that several precrisis audits were “the subject of pending P.C.A.O.B. investigations and may lead to disciplinary actions against firms or individuals,” but he of course gave no details. As a result, all firms are tarred, not just those the board thinks acted irresponsibly.To be fair, the accounting rules give the firms a difficult job in evaluating a bank’s estimate of fair value of securities that rarely trade. Banks have some flexibility in determining how to make those estimates, and the auditor is supposed to satisfy itself that the methods used are reasonable. The board makes it clear in the publicly released sections of inspection reports that banks use varying methods.As a result, even if every audit were done properly, there would be no assurance that the results would be comparable.One reason the board exists is that investors were shocked by disclosures in the Enron scandal that local auditors for Arthur Andersen — the fifth member, now defunct, of what was then the Big Five — had felt free to ignore advice on accounting standards from the firm’s technical experts, who worked in what is known in the industry as the national office.Other firms assured me at the time that nothing comparable could happen in their operations.But perhaps it can.In his speech, Mr. Doty quoted from two assurances given by auditors to clients, and discovered by board inspectors. He did not name either firm involved.One firm promised that the auditors on the scene would “support the desired outcome where the audit team may be confronted with an issue that merits consultation with our national office.”At least that firm seemed to leave open the possibility that the national office would prevail. Another pitch for audit work went further. It promised, Mr. Doty said, that audit decisions would be “made by the global engagement partner with no second guessing or national office reversals.”Abraham Briloff, a longtime professor of accounting at Baruch College and a critic of misleading accounting practices — and a man whose articles I had the honor of editing many years ago when I worked at Barron’s — used to tell a joke about a chief executive interviewing prospective auditors and asking, “What is two plus two?”The winner, he said, responded, “What number were you looking for?”Now it is board audit committees, not chief executives, who are supposed to hire auditors. But the fact that accounting firms thought such promises would help — and were willing to put the pitches in writing — is evidence that too little has changed since the accounting oversight board was established.One can hope most firms would never stoop that low to win business, and that most audit committees would summarily reject any firm that pursued such a course. But because board disciplinary actions can remain secret for years, we have no way of knowing which firm or firms have partners willing to make such offers, or which companies accepted them.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','“Our thoughtful, bipartisan solution reins in an E.P.A. gone wild whose bureaucrats are oblivious to the nation’s economic woes and soaring unemployment,” said Mr. Upton, who co-sponsored the bill with Representative Edward Whitfield, Republican of Kentucky.On Wednesday, the Senate defeated four amendments that would have permanently or temporarily prevented the environmental agency from policing greenhouse gas emissions, including one measure that was virtually identical to the House bill. That amendment, sponsored by Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, both Republicans, drew four Democratic votes but remained well short of a filibuster-proof majority.The votes leave Congress deadlocked for now on an issue that has stirred heated scientific, economic and political debate for years.Republican leaders are pushing to attach similar anti-E.P.A. measures to the current-year budget bill that is now being negotiated. If that fails, they will most likely try again on future spending bills.Thursday’s vote was in sharp contrast to action two years ago, when a Democratic-controlled House passed a comprehensive climate change and energy bill that would have created a nationwide trading system to rein in carbon dioxide emissions. That legislation died last year in the Senate.The debate in the House has unfolded along familiar lines this week, with well-rehearsed arguments about the science of global warming and the effects of new environmental regulations on domestic energy prices and jobs.Republicans said they were trying to stay the heavy hand of officials at the E.P.A. who were imposing costly “job killing” regulations on business. Democrats argued that the Clean Air Act’s limits on air pollutants save tens of thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of illnesses every year, and that extending those rules to greenhouse gases would slow dangerous climate change.Mr. Upton said that his bill would allow the E.P.A. to continue to regulate most air pollutants, but that the Clean Air Act never envisioned limits on carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gases produced by thousands of sources around the country.Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, took the argument further. “E.P.A. is on a mission to destroy American industry,” he said on Wednesday in defending the bill. “When regulators, especially regulators at the E.P.A., go to work, they get in a big room and sit around a conference table drinking their lattes and say, ‘Who can we regulate today?’ because that’s what regulators do. Regulators regulate, all on the so-called premise of protecting us from ourselves.”Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, was a co-author of the 2009 climate bill and the most outspoken opponent of the Upton-Whitfield measure. He called the bill “a divisive, partisan measure that takes us in exactly the wrong direction.”He said the bill had no chance of becoming law and was merely a time-consuming distraction from the urgent task of reducing fossil fuel use and developing clean-burning alternatives.  “Americans want clean air to breathe and sensible limits on carbon pollution,” Mr. Waxman said.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','Spyker is hoping to make an announcement about financing for Saab on Friday, according to a person briefed on the plans who was not permitted to speak publicly. He declined to elaborate.Spyker’s chief executive, Victor R. Muller, who is also in temporary control of Saab, insisted this week that Saab was not on the verge of collapse but was merely suffering from “a small glitch.” Those words have not reassured investors. The company’s shares fell 3.5 percent on Thursday, to 3.85 euros ($5.50), in Amsterdam, and are down 11 percent this year, giving it a market capitalization of 77 million euros ($110 million).The problem threatens to exacerbate difficulties across a swath of Saab suppliers, which have delivered millions of dollars in parts but have yet to be paid, said Svenake Berglie, chief executive of FKG, a suppliers’ association.Many are just now emerging from the global recession and have not been able to strengthen their balance sheets, he said. “This has to be solved by next week; otherwise it will be really troublesome for our members.”Mr. Berglie described Saab as the lifeblood for local engineering jobs. “We need Saab in Scandinavia,” he said.The Swedish automaker built up a strong brand reputation, particularly from the 1970s onward, for its stylish designs and powerful sedans, although the reliability of its cars was often questioned. It employs 3,800 people, mostly at the Trollhattan plant, in which G.M. invested 750 million euros, ($1.1 billion). Several thousand more supply jobs depend on Saab. Saabs are also produced at a G.M. plant in Mexico.“The situation is certainly not very good,” said Peter Cooke, a professor at the Center for Automotive Management at the University of Buckingham in England. “My concern from day one was that Spyker might have bitten off more than it could chew.”Spyker, which made only several dozen luxury cars in 2009, bought Saab in February 2010, after G.M. had threatened to shut it down as part of a restructuring.Mr. Antonov, chairman of the Convers Group in Moscow, had owned a big stake in Spyker before the purchase, but G.M. compelled him to sell his holding before it would negotiate the sale because news reports had linked him to organized crime.Spyker has recently applied to allow Mr. Antonov back as a shareholder, but the Swedish government has a potential veto because, as part of the original sale, it guaranteed a 400 million euro ($571 million) loan to Saab from the European Investment Bank. The Swedish authorities are investigating claims of impropriety involving Mr. Antonov, who has denied wrongdoing.If cleared, Mr. Antonov is expected to take a stake of nearly 30 percent. The Swedish Debt Office is expected to make an announcement in coming weeks. Jonas Froberg, a Swedish journalist who wrote a book about Saab last year, said the inquiry would have to find “something severe” on Mr. Antonov or risk criticism, because there are few other interested bidders.Last year, Mr. Antonov said the accusations, including economic crimes and money laundering, had been fabricated because of his nationality. “Maybe national prejudices can be abandoned for good,” he wrote in an op-ed article in The New York Times. “Otherwise European countries and brands will become victims of their own narrow-mindedness as Russian capital finds new, more progressive markets.”His interest in Saab, though, is something of a mystery to analysts. Elena Sakhnova, a transportation analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, noted that Russian car companies were seeking partnerships to bring in better management and technologies. But Mr. Antonov does not own a Russian car company.Tomas Jermalavicius, a Baltic expert at the International Center for Defense Studies in Tallinn, Estonia, who was familiar with Mr. Antonov’s business activities in the region, said Russian executives were often interested in diversifying their assets and bolstering their reputations.“Russian businessmen are adamant to burnish their reputations as owners of prestigious brands,” Mr. Jermalavicius said. “This could be one motivation. It might also make some business sense.”In an analogy with the failed effort by Sberbank, the Russian state bank, to buy Opel from G.M., he said Mr. Antonov could be interested in acquiring Saab’s inventory of patents and technologies, which could then be sold to Russia’s outdated automotive industry.Spyker announced plans in February to sell its sports car business, based in Coventry, England, to Mr. Antonov for 32 million euros ($45.7 million) to allow it to focus solely on Saab. Spyker also issued new shares last month to help pay down its debt.“Without Spyker we would not have been able to acquire Saab Automobile last year, but the Spyker business soon became a small fish in a large pond,” Mr. Muller, the chief, said at the timeSaab retains supply and some distribution deals with G.M., which declined to comment. Saab also announced agreements last month with Chinese and Russia companies to sell cars and parts in those markets.But Mr. Cooke, the University of Buckingham professor, said Saab still needed major investment, and its location in high-cost Sweden made it unattractive for most large automobile groups.“It’s too big to be a niche player and too small to be mainstream,” he said. “It has a strong brand, but why did G.M. want to get rid of it?”Saab sold 31,696 cars wholesale in 2010, compared with 27,482 in 2009. That modest increase was not enough to prevent a net loss of 218 million euros ($311 million) in 2010 on sales of 819 million euros ($1.17 billion). Mr. Froberg, the author, said Saab’s new owners “totally misjudged the time, effort and money” needed to resume production and reopen sales channels.Spyker is sticking to a goal of selling 80,000 cars this year and turning a profit in 2012, and will add the new 9-4X crossover and update its mainstay 9-3 and 9-5 models later this year.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','Minutes later, with an ammunition belt strapped to his waist and a .38-caliber pistol in one hand and a .32-caliber gun in the other, he opened fire wildly in two first-floor classrooms. The classroom walls are covered with bullet holes from the shots that missed, the police said.The children began running and trying to hide. A boy who was wounded fled the school and found a police officer nearby, officials said.The officer, Sgt. Marcio Alves, saw Mr. Oliveira leaving a classroom and ordered him to drop the guns. Mr. Oliveira ignored the order and began climbing a staircase to more classrooms, Sergeant Alves recounted later. Sergeant Alves shot, hitting the gunman in the leg.Mr. Oliveira then shot himself in the head.During the attack, having stopped to reload twice, Mr. Oliveira killed 10 girls and 2 boys, ages 12 to 14. They died from bullet wounds mostly to the head and chest, said Martha Rocha, the chief of Rio’s Civil Police.A letter found in Mr. Oliveira’s pocket made it clear that the attack was premeditated, and that he intended to die, but it offered no motive for the shootings.Instead, he left explicit instructions for his burial — he wanted to be near his adopted mother, who died in 2009 — and the disposition of his house, which he wanted to donate to an animal shelter. He asked to be buried in a way that reflected some aspects of Islamic tradition, including in a white sheet he said he left in a bag on the first floor of the school, but he also asked Jesus for eternal life.In the only reference to his deed, he sought “God’s forgiveness for what I have done.”A longtime neighbor and former member of Mr. Oliveira’s church said Mr. Oliveira had been a lifelong Jehovah’s Witness before turning to Islam two years ago. Other neighbors on the street where he grew up said he had few friends and spent many hours in front of his computer on social networking sites. In the past year, several said, he had taken to wearing black clothing.“People thought it was strange when he began wearing black, but we could never imagine he was going to do something like this,” said Fabio Santos, 27, who said he knew him for more than 10 years. “Maybe it was because his mother and grandmother had died.”After his mother died, he and his father moved away. It was around that time that he left his job as a warehouse manager for a food exporter, Mr. Santos said. Mr. Oliveira came back to the Realengo house alone now and again, neighbors said.“He was a very lonely person,” said Elda Lira, 55, a neighbor who said she had known him since he was a baby. “He was always isolated and in his own world.”Sérgio Cabral, Rio’s governor, called him an “animal and psychopath.”Mr. Cabral has been at the heart of efforts to reduce gun violence in Rio ahead of the city’s twin billing on the world stage — the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. But those efforts have been focused on clearing out violent drug gangs from some of Rio’s most dangerous slums, not on securing schools from armed former students.Brazil has also been struggling to contain the flow of arms that feed the violence.With students and family members in a state of shock, Eduardo Paes, Rio’s mayor, said the school would remain closed on Friday.But family members of the victims questioned whether the school should ever reopen.“I heard there was blood splattered all over the school,” said Bianca Assis, 24, whose cousin Edson Clayton, 14, was among the wounded. “What mother will allow her child to ever go back there?” As a minimum, she said, the state needed to provide more security in the schools.“If the school continues to be open” to unchecked visitors, “these kinds of things will continue to happen,” Ms. Assis said. “Today we had dead people, tomorrow we will have rapes.”Friends and family members huddled outside the Albert Schweitzer Hospital on Thursday, waiting anxiously for news, as surgeons inside treated wounded students.By early afternoon, news of the shooting had spread throughout the country, shocking officials. President Dilma Rousseff became visibly emotional at an event in Brasília when she asked those present to observe a minute of silence for the “defenseless children” in Realengo.“This type of crime is not characteristic of our country,” she said. “All of us here, men and women, are united to repudiate this type of violence.”'"
"'11-04-08,'0','Three Palestinian civilians, ages 18, 23 and 25, and one Hamas militant were killed in the Israeli bombing of Rafah in southern Gaza. Another Palestinian man, 50, was killed when a tank shell hit his house east of Gaza City, according to a spokesman for the Hamas government medical services.Hamas later announced a cease-fire for all of its factions in the Gaza Strip, the newspaper Haaretz reported.Violence along the Israel-Gaza border has ebbed and flowed in the past few weeks. Last month was marked by 10 days of heavy rocket and mortar fire from Gaza against southern Israel, repeated Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and fears of escalation into all-out confrontation.Still, neither side appeared keen to allow the violence to spiral out of control. In late March, Hamas met with the smaller Gaza groups that carried out much of the rocket fire and persuaded them to reinstate an unofficial cease-fire with Israel. The cease-fire has largely held since Israel ended its three-week offensive in Gaza in January 2009.Israel seemed to want to restore deterrence on Thursday, but also to contain the situation.Israel’s defense minister, Ehud Barak, emphasized that the Israeli actions were meant as a response to the attack on the bus.“They will continue as long as necessary to make it clear that such things cannot happen again,” he told soldiers of the Gaza division, according to a statement from his office.Short-range, inaccurate rockets and mortar shells frequently fall in Israeli territory along the border with Gaza, occasionally hitting houses but more often landing on open ground.But Israeli security officials said that the Kornet antitank missile fired on Thursday was an advanced and accurate weapon deliberately aimed at the bus. The missile, which is laser guided, has a range of about three miles, and in this case, according to initial findings, it hit its target from a distance of nearly two miles, the officials said.Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, a spokeswoman for the Israeli military, said it would be impossible to mistake the large, yellow school bus for a military vehicle.Mr. Barak described the missile strike as a terrorist attack.In another first on Thursday, Israel’s Iron Dome antirocket missile defense system successfully intercepted a longer-range, Katyusha-type rocket that was fired out of Gaza at the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, 10 miles north of Gaza, according to the Israeli military.The first mobile battery of the system was deployed near the southern city of Beersheba in late March, and a second battery was placed near Ashkelon a few days ago as part of an evaluation.Thursday’s interception, which destroyed the incoming rocket midair, was the first time that the system was put to the test in battlefield conditions.But Israeli officials have emphasized that the Iron Dome system is still in an experimental stage and cannot provide full protection for residents of the south.The school bus was carrying only the driver and the youth when it was hit at a junction near Saad, an Israeli communal farm near the border. The driver was slightly wounded. More than 30 other children who were on the bus had been dropped off at their homes shortly before the attack.There was a gaping hole in the back of the bus, which was badly damaged, its windows blown out. Roads in the area were closed, and area residents were told to take cover and enter bomb shelters.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','“Emboldened by the legitimacy that they believe a law gives to abusive behavior, the government is likely to use the N.G.O. law to silence its people and to tighten its control on their daily lives,” he said. “The international community needs to act now, or Cambodia will continue in its march away from democracy and toward autocracy.”Simon Taylor, director of Global Witness, an independent rights monitoring group, said the proposed law was a test of the commitment of donor nations and international agencies to the future of the civil society they had worked for two decades to foster.“If the donors stand by while the government adopts this law, they cannot in good conscience claim to be working in the interests of Cambodia’s development objectives,” he said.Despite Cambodia’s continuing pressures on human rights and its failure to control corruption, illegal logging and an epidemic of sometimes violent land seizures by powerful interests, international financial support for Mr. Hun Sen’s government has continued to increase.At their most recent annual conference last June, donor nations and international agencies pledged $1.1 billion in aid for this year, a record amount, up from $950 million last year, despite widespread criticism that much of the money was misspent or diverted.The aid is equal to roughly half the country’s official budget. In principle, it gives the international community leverage to maintain or strengthen basic freedoms and democratic institutions.The amount has risen even as Cambodia’s economy has steadied itself and begun to grow, and even as China has matched Western donors with its own financial support, which comes unencumbered by the human rights conditions imposed by the West.In December 2009, China awarded Cambodia $1.2 billion in aid and soft loans. That pledge came immediately after Cambodia deported 20 ethnic Uighur refugees to China over the strong objections of the United States and the United Nations, which called the deportation a violation of human rights.“It must be remembered that the freedoms of association, expression and assembly in Cambodia are already heavily restricted, particularly at the community level,” said one of Cambodia’s oldest human rights groups, Licadho, in a separate report last week on the proposed law.In their statement on Thursday, the international human rights agencies said that the strict financial conditions of the proposed law would disproportionately affect small groups with limited resources operating at the local level, “making them vulnerable to prosecution for carrying out legitimate activities without the proper legal status.”The agencies voiced concern over what they called a lack of safeguards and meaningful judicial review mechanisms and pointed to the vague wording regarding a right of appeal of government sanctions.Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, “Cambodia’s proposed law could too easily be used to refuse registration or close down organizations that serve the public interest.”“Over the past 20 years, the development of civil society has been one of Cambodia’s few enduring achievements,” he said. “This law threatens to reverse that progress.”In the early 1990s, Cambodia emerged from two decades of civil war and mass killings by the Khmer Rouge, which left the country brutalized, without an educated class or civic institutions.As part of a $2 billion nation-building effort, the United Nations established democratic forms of government and introduced standards of human rights that soon became a part of political discourse.The concept and practice of human rights and political freedoms grew hand in hand with the introduction of the nongovernmental organizations that are now under threat.'"
"'11-04-08,'0','“From the point of view of being able to negotiate good terms for the Portuguese economy and display a firm commitment that might make the European Commission and the I.M.F. less demanding, this could not have happened at a worse time,” said Pedro C. Magalhães, a professor of politics at the University of Lisbon.Lisbon’s request for aid also puts additional pressure on other ailing European economies, in particular Spain, which has undertaken austerity measures, a pension overhaul and a cleanup of its banking sector to stay out of danger. Any rescue request from Spain — with an economy larger than that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined — could put the European common currency project at risk.On Thursday, Spain held a successful bond auction, raising 4.1 billion euros ($5.8 billion) at a yield that was little changed from three months ago. Separately, France sold 9.49 billion euros in bonds Thursday, drawing strong demand.The Spanish sale “confirms that there are no signs of a contagion spreading to Spain at present,” said Chiara Cremonesi, a fixed-income strategist in London for UniCredit. “Spain continues to be perceived by investors as part of the safer periphery countries group.”In Lisbon, politicians from both sides are expected to meet in the coming days to work out details of their bailout package request.  On Friday, Europe's monetary affairs commissioner said that preliminary estimates indicated that Portugal would need about 80 billion euros, or $114 billion, though some analysts have suggested that the amount could be as much as 110 billion euros.  The commissioner, Olli Rehn, said, according to The Associated Press,  that talks over a strict reforms program would start immediately with all major political parties and that it was essential for Portugal to reach a ""cross-party"" agreement.The A.P. quoted Mr.  Rehn as saying that  he hoped a final deal will be in place by mid-May.The cabinet minister in the caretaker government, Pedro Silva Pereira, confirmed the formal rescue request, but would not comment on the amount of aid requested, saying that the next steps would be defined by the European Commission. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the bank had “encouraged Portuguese authorities to ask for support.”If the pattern of previous bailouts is repeated, it could take several weeks for a team of Brussels officials to discuss the conditions of a bailout with Lisbon, which will ultimately need the approval of European finance ministers.The negotiations will occur in the midst of an election campaign that will probably be dominated by the question of who is to blame for Portugal’s predicament. The Social Democratic leader, Pedro Passos Coelho, supported the decision to seek outside help, but he and Mr. Sócrates are blaming each other for putting Portugal in a desperate situation.“What the election campaign is now about is who should assume the responsibility for inviting international creditors into Portugal,” said Diogo Ortigão Ramos, a partner at the law firm Cuatrecasas, Gonçalves Pereira. Mr. Silva Pereira said Portugal’s caretaker government had asked President Aníbal Cavaco Silva to talk to the opposition parties. On Thursday, Mr. Cavaco Silva, in a Facebook message, called for “responsible cooperation” on the part of the opposition parties to help negotiate an acceptable deal.António Nogueira Leite, an economic adviser to the Social Democratic Party and a professor at the Nova School of Economics and Business in Lisbon, said, “We have to learn from the mistakes in Greece and Ireland and be able to argue for a different treatment, but obviously our room to maneuver has been diminished because we have postponed our call for help for much longer than we should have.”Portugal’s muddled political situation also raises “problems of legal uncertainty,” notably over whether a dissolved Parliament could approve a rescue agreement, Mr. Magalhães, the politics professor, said. A new government is unlikely to take office before the end of June, with Portugal’s most recent opinion polls suggesting that the June vote could result in a hung Parliament.Short-term needs must also be resolved. Portugal faces a bond redemption of 4.3 billion euros on April 15.Some officials suspect Portugal might need to seek bilateral loans from other countries to tide it over. Others say the announcement of the aid request on Wednesday might drive down the cost of short-term borrowing for Portugal and avert a problem.Portugal is now embarking on what will be its third international bailout since returning to democracy in the 1970s, with previous interventions by the I.M.F. in 1978 and 1983. This time, however, “the sense of punishment will be much stronger because the expectations of citizens are much higher than three decades ago, when Portugal was not even in the E.U.,” said António Vitorino, who was in the Portuguese government that negotiated the 1983 rescue and a former European commissioner.In 1983, Mr. Vitorino noted, Portugal was able to revive an export-led recovery by significantly devaluing its currency — no longer an option under euro membership. “The money injection that we received had a much stronger short-term effect on our economy than it could have this time,” he said.'"

The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.56 percent.In the oil markets, crude prices rose $1.47 to close at $110.30 amid the continued turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East and a report that supply growth was slowing at a time that demand was increasing.An analysis by the International Monetary Fund, which was released as part of its World Economic Outlook, said that oil demand in developing countries was rapidly catching up with that of developed countries at a time when production constraints were beginning to restrain major oil exporters.In addition, “Japan has spooked the market with the idea that Japan may need more oil to replace the lost nuclear generation,” Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said.Wall Street was able to brush off other developments from abroad. As expected, the European Central Bank raised interest rates and Portugal requested a bailout.“From the E.C.B. perspective, Trichet really did not rock the boat,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said, referring to the central bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet. “I think that is creating some stability in the market. I would not call it a bullish factor, but it is not bearish. He did not come out and pound the table.”Richard Ross, the global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson & Company, noted that the S.& P. has rallied more than 6 percent since the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on March 11.“What is interesting is the markets are holding up extremely well,” he said, despite global events and the rising crude prices.“All of those factors are telling you people are willing to look past the headlines for the time being,” Mr. Ross said. “There is an undercurrent of demand.”The equipment maker, Caterpillar, declined more than 1 percent on the Dow, closing at $109.85.Chesapeake Energy was up 2.4 percent at $34.49.Retail stocks inched up after the March sales report.

"'11-04-09,'0','ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — The government’s case against a former Central Intelligence Agency officer charged with leaking classified documents to a reporter may not make it to trial because of potential issues with a witness, a federal prosecutor said Friday.Jeffrey Sterling of O’Fallon, Mo., who worked for the C.I.A. from 1993 to 2002, is accused of leaking secrets about Iran to James Risen, a reporter for The New York Times. A 2006 book by Mr. Risen, “State of War,” revealed details about the C.I.A.’s covert spy war with Iran.But many details of the government’s case remain classified. While it is clear from the indictment, for instance, that Mr. Risen is accused of being the recipient of Mr. Sterling’s disclosures, the indictment refers to Mr. Risen as “Author A.” Iran is referred to as “Country A.”At a pretrial hearing Friday in United States District Court, the prosecutor, William Welch, told the judge that “potential witness issues” would determine whether the case goes to trial. He did not elaborate.Neither the judge nor Mr. Welch divulged which witness posed a problem, talking around the issue in open court because it has apparently been addressed to some extent in proceedings that remain under seal. But it seems clear that testimony from Mr. Risen, who has not cooperated with the investigation, is key to the government’s case.Judge Leonie M. Brinkema had quashed a pre-indictment subpoena demanding Mr. Risen’s testimony. And the Justice Department has stringent rules for seeking subpoenas from journalists, who have some protection under the First Amendment.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','“The missionary experience offers several things from a storytelling point of view,” said Steven D. Greydanus, a film critic for the National Catholic Register and Christianity Today, a magazine geared to evangelical Protestants. “There is the cross-cultural experience, an element of exoticism. There’s a chance to see characters display heroism, possibly even martyrdom. But at the same time, in some of the work, the missionary experience has been problematized with concerns about imperialism, condescension to natives, the religious arrogance of claiming to know the truth.”Rosalie Beck, a professor of religion at Baylor University in Waco, Tex., spent the early 1970s in South Vietnam providing support services to Baptist missionaries. For both academic and personal reasons since then, she has kept an informed eye on missionary film and fiction.“Many works get it right and wrong at the same time,” she wrote in an e-mail. “More thoughtful representations, like Chinua Achebe’s ‘Things Fall Apart,’ have several missionary characters. One is always the stereotypical, Bible-thumping, intolerant and insensitive person. This image is often balanced by a person who is culturally aware, caring, approachable and open to the culture in which they work.”The creators of “The Book of Mormon” — Trey Parker and Matt Stone of the satiric cartoon series “South Park” and Robert Lopez of the Broadway musical “Avenue Q” — began mulling the Mormon religion as subject matter when they met seven years ago.They considered and discarded the ideas of building a show around the biography of the faith’s founder, Joseph Smith, or the epic battles between the Nephites and Lamanites in the actual Book of Mormon. Instead, they felt drawn to the missionaries. Mr. Parker had first heard their stories from Mormon classmates in high school; as an adult traveling abroad, he habitually chatted with missionaries he spotted in their trademark suits and nametags.Mr. Lopez was taken with the built-in dramatic potential. “It’s a coming-of-age story and a buddy story,” he said. “They’re 19, coming from a sheltered and naïve place, being sent into the real world. Hilarity is built in.”So, as the creators came to discover, was risk and challenge, in both physical and spiritual senses. While interviewing returned missionaries in Salt Lake City, the three writers heard one recount seeing a villager stoned to death in Cambodia. He was so shaken that he left Asia entirely for an assignment elsewhere.The young man’s recollection now has been transmuted into the shooting in Act I. And a detail that theatergoers take as a laugh line — the warlord calls himself Gen. Butt Naked, with a profane adjective not suitable here — is more like a grim hyperlink. As the show’s creators knew, there was an actual Gen. Butt Naked (given name: Milton Blahyi) whose troops killed as many as 20,000 people in Liberia’s civil war.Viewed only in their vanilla innocence, Mormon missionaries can be “an easy bunch to laugh at, especially to a cynical adult audience,” Mr. Stone wrote in an e-mail.He continued, “We thought if we could tell the story from inside their experience, then those cynical laughs could be harnessed for greater power.”In its wiggy way, “The Book of Mormon” also depicts the faith crisis that strikes missionaries when their theological commonplaces prove irrelevant to the problems at hand: civil war, AIDS, poverty, genital disfigurement of women. Elder Price’s partner, Elder Cunningham, winds up improvising a version of Mormon text that addresses the issues, and, coincidentally, leads a visiting Mormon supervisor to fire him.Where “The Book of Mormon” went genially, other artists have delved in a more critical way. Both the novel and the film versions of “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” by Peter Matthiessen have missionaries bringing ruin onto the indigenous people they purport to help. In Ms. Kingsolver’s “Poisonwood Bible,” a missionary in Congo embodies what she called “the arrogance and misunderstanding that have characterized Western interventions in postcolonial Africa.”But perhaps because she spent time there as a doctor’s daughter, and perhaps because her novel drew in part on missionary memoirs, Ms. Kingsolver was able to come to a complicated view of her protagonist and the variations on his type in other art and literature.“It’s probably safe to say artists are intrigued by evangelical people of all kinds,” she put it. “Passion is the ultimate subject, isn’t it? And extremes are irresistible. It’s a great challenge to create a character who is simultaneously charismatic and repellent.”'"
"'11-04-09,'0','In the case of Bahrain, a close ally and home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, it cited the Bahraini government’s move last September to take over a prominent advocacy group, the Bahrain Human Rights Society, and the arrests a month later of more than 200 Shiites. Those were among a series of repressive measures that led to popular protests that the government violently crushed last month, with the help of troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Those troops remain in the country, amid a broad campaign of arrests, intimidation and violence against protesters, journalists and others.“There are a range of very real issues that need to be addressed,” Michael H. Posner, the assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, said of the demands of protesters in Bahrain, mostly Shiites who have long bristled under the rule of Bahrain’s Sunni king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. “They’re not going to be addressed only by security measures.”In contrast with Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, however, the Obama administration has not called for a change of government in Bahrain.The report highlighted a rise in extrajudicial killings, torture and rape by security forces in Pakistan, whose relations with the United States have been deeply strained in recent months. Mrs. Clinton also cited the country as an example of a “disturbing trend” worldwide in violence against racial, ethnic and religious minority groups.“In Pakistan, for example, blasphemy remains a crime punishable by death,” she said. “And the blasphemy law has been enforced against Muslims who do not share the beliefs of other Muslims, and also against non-Muslims, who worship differently.”The report is an exhaustive yearly exercise in cataloging rights abuses in 194 countries, and includes both friends and foes of the United States government. It includes more than two million words and, if printed, more than 7,000 pages.Mrs. Clinton said that the United States was “particularly concerned” by what she called “growing trends” in restricting civic organizations and blocking access to the Internet. More than 40 countries now restrict online access to varying degrees, while more than 90 countries have laws controlling organizations, according to the report.“Some censored Web sites for political reasons,” she said. “And in a number of countries, democracy and human rights activists and independent bloggers found their e-mails hacked or their computers infected with spyware that reported back on their every keystroke. Digital activists have been tortured so they would reveal their passwords and implicate their colleagues.”Mrs. Clinton also singled out several countries that have long been at odds with the United States over human rights and other matters, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Russia and Myanmar. Her most forceful remarks, though, focused on China, a striking departure from her previous statements and one that reflected what she called “negative trends” that had worsened in recent weeks. She strongly criticized dozens of arbitrary arrests, including the detention last Sunday of the artist Ai Weiwei.“Such detention is contrary to the rule of law,” she said.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','That might not be the case for at least some of the fans, who were heard booing at several key junctures, as when the Mets twice put runners at third base with one out and could not score.The first time came in the sixth, with the Mets trailing, 3-2. Ike Davis and Willie Harris struck out to end the threat. In the seventh, with the score the same, Reyes struck out and Angel Pagan bounced back to the pitcher.David Wright, who doubled and scored a run, said some of the players might be a tad anxious, looking to slug home the winning runs when a more modest approach would serve just as well.“Sometimes you take that R.B.I. groundout, that sac fly,” he said. “Right now we’ve got a bunch of guys trying to get that big hit and that’s a good thing, but also that can hurt you a little bit.”The day began with Wright and starting pitcher R. A. Dickey receiving the loudest ovations during pregame introductions, while Mike Pelfrey and Francisco Rodriguez were the only players to hear boos when their names were called.Although the Mets announced the attendance as 41,075 and said it was a sellout, there were many empty seats. As the game progressed and the cold air began to impose its bite, those empty seats increased with each run the Nationals scored.Wright, who has at least one hit in all seven of his home openers, noted the cold weather. But he declined to assess whether the conditions contributed to the empty seats, especially late in the game when he was batting against reliever Drew Storen.“I don’t know, man,” Wright said. “I was worried about Drew Storen, not who was there and who wasn’t.”Perhaps the most frustrated Met was Dickey, who had been given the honor of starting the home opener, but lasted only five innings because of a split fingernail on his index finger. As a knuckleballer, Dickey digs the nails on his index and middle fingers into the ball.But after he split the nail in the first inning, he had to file it down, and that meant he could not get the feel he normally has. As a result, he tied his career high by walking five batters, including one that forced in a run.“It’s not often that you have to come out of a game because of a broken nail,” he said. “That’s just the nature of the beast with a knuckleball.”Dickey allowed three runs, six hits and the five walks. He struck out three, including Ryan Zimmerman on a 62-mile-per-hour knuckler that moved so slowly it seemed to defy gravity as it drifted toward home plate.But after that it was a struggle. Dickey walked five batters in a game for the first time since 2008, when he was a member of the Seattle Mariners. He said he expected the nail to grow back quickly enough that it would not be an issue for his next scheduled start on Wednesday.That game will not be anticipated the same way this one was, but perhaps the outcome will be better for Dickey. Motivated by the fan reaction as he warmed up before the game, Dickey had so looked forward to the warmth of a happy day. Instead, he was left to ponder the cold reality.“You don’t often go from such highs to such lows,” he said. “But that’s the nature of the game we play.”'"
"'11-04-09,'0','It did not rule out additional closures, saying it would determine future production schedules later. The shutdowns affect 25,000 workers, who can report for training or plant improvement activities or take vacation time, Toyota said.“The situation in Japan affects many automakers and many other industries. Extraordinary efforts are under way to help suppliers recover,” Steve St. Angelo, Toyota’s executive vice president for engineering and manufacturing in North America, said in a statement. “We are slowing down to conserve parts yet maintain production as much as possible.”Toyota said about 85 percent of the parts and materials for the 12 models it assembles in North America came from within the continent.Other automakers are also feeling the pinch of supply chain disruptions.Ford Motor said a Kentucky truck plant that was closed this week to conserve parts would reopen on Monday. A Ford plant in Belgium that was shut also is scheduled to resume work next week.Ford is still dealing with a shortage of a metallic pigment that comes from a plant in the evacuation zone around Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Ford, which has stopped taking orders for vehicles to be painted “tuxedo black” and is building fewer models in several red hues, is studying whether it can get a substitute from another supplier, according to a company spokesman, Todd Nissen.But making such a switch is not simple, Mr. Nissen explained, because each component on a vehicle undergoes complex testing, and swapping in a new paint could result in mismatched portions or a less durable finish. In addition, finding replacement parts in the proper color later on could be impossible.“We’re working on potential replacements, but I’m guessing that the supplier itself is looking into ways into being able to make it somewhere else,” he said.At General Motors, a sport utility vehicle plant in Texas was shut Friday when workers were to report for an overtime shift. A G.M. spokeswoman, Sherrie Childers-Arb, said the overtime would be rescheduled.Toyota and Subaru have canceled overtime shifts at their North American plants, and Honda is running some of its American and Canadian plants for fewer hours.Nissan’s plants in Tennessee and Mississippi were closed Friday and will be shut again on Monday and three more days later this month.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','Back in January, Mr. Stern predicted as much, saying that stocks would have to rise more before most investors would buy equities again.To one contrarian, waiting on equities is not a bad thing with the prospect of inflation still low. “Domestically, you don’t have the source of factors to create inflation,” said Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank. “You have broad monetary policy crawling along. You have a situation where unemployment or underemployment is extremely high. You don’t have the ability for employees to gouge more from their employers.”So with the second quarter under way, let’s see what our group sees for the rest of the year.CONSENSUS The big debate when I spoke to this group in January was over whether the time was right to move money from bonds to stocks. With the exception of Mr. Cookson, the consensus was that it was.Those beliefs are even firmer now. “It is important to point out that stocks have not been this cheap to bonds since 1980,” said Niall Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “We see a global equity strategy focused on where the earnings are produced.”To that end, he treats Japanese equities like American companies because the United States consumes so many Japanese products, while he considers Nike a non-American company because only 25 percent of its earnings come from sales here.Some suggestions for variations on stocks have not fared as well.Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth, said he favored dividend-paying stocks in January but admitted that they performed better in February when the stock market lost some value than they did when the market was strong.Still, he said he believed that Cisco Systems announcing its first dividend ever in March was a sign that such stocks could come back in vogue. “It’s still a nice play in risk-reward terms,” he said. “I think we’re at the very beginning of the reallocation into equities, and that makes it attractive.”Mr. Stern said he continued to believe that convertible bonds were right for people who want more return but were still hesitant about putting a lot of money into equities. “If the stock went up 25 percent, the convertible bond could go up 12 to 15 percent,” he said. “If the stock went down 25 percent, the convertible bond would roughly break even.”SURPRISES Beyond the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the unrest in the Middle East, there were other unexpected changes.On the positive side, the unemployment rate has dropped to 8.8 percent. Mr. Madigan had predicted that it would hover around 9 to 10 percent for the foreseeable future. “I’m thrilled that I was wrong,” he said. But he said he did not think there would be real economic growth until employees were paid more.The worries about a wave of municipal bond defaults seem to have been overdone — or at least premature. Mr. Gannon said his group created a model with a 2 to 3 percent default rate for the year, but he now sees that as too high. And even if that default rate occurs, he said it would not have a huge impact on portfolios with higher-grade municipal bonds.He noted that the rate at which investors recovered money from defaults of general obligation bonds has historically been high. Plus, he estimated that even with a few defaults, you would still do better than if you left your money in cash.On the negative side, oil prices are far higher than anyone imagined because of the turmoil in the Middle East. Yet Mr. Cookson argued that higher oil prices were ultimately going to affect growth, not cause inflation.“In the U.S., it’s costing you 30 percent more to fill up your gas tank,” he said. “If you can’t get more money to offset that, it’s a growth question, not an inflation question. People look in generic terms at inflation, but you can’t look at it that way.”Mr. Cookson’s one seeming error was to advocate buying Japanese equities. Of course, he could not have foreseen the events in Japan. But he said he remained just as bullish on Japan over the long term. “We went even more overweight,” he said.The one conundrum is the continuing rise in the price of gold. Mr. Stern had predicted it would drop in value, but except for a dip, it has continued to rise. “Even the gold bulls would acknowledge that they cannot tell you using pen and paper that it’s going to be worth $1,486 on a particular day,” he said. “It’s a feeling that it is going higher.” He still advocates cutting gold allocations.NEW RISKS The rest of 2011 is certainly not clear sailing. Three areas concern these strategists: Saudi Arabian stability, Chinese inflation and politicians in the United States.After the 30-year reign of Hosni Mubarak came to an end in Egypt, there is concern about the stability of the regime in Saudi Arabia. If that government fell, oil prices would rise stratospherically and send the economy into a global recession. “You can’t put a risk rating on it,” Mr. Cookson said. “People do, but it’s a meaningless exercise.”Inflation in China seems to be more predictable. Mr. Stern noted that real estate development increased 35 percent last year from the previous year, a sign of a bubble. But he said he thought it was a good sign that Chinese policy makers raised interest rates this week.As to the budget battle in Washington, “We’re not interested in whether Republicans or Democrats win,” Mr. Stern said. “We want some policies that restrain the debt level. We think grown-ups need to make grown-up decisions.”Whether the group’s latest predictions will fare as well as their earlier ones is hard to say. We’ll check in on them next quarter to see how they did.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','News International proposed that cases other than the eight it hoped to settle might be overseen by an independent adjudicator. It said it planned to set up “a compensation scheme with a view to dealing with justifiable claims fairly and efficiently,” a plan that could cost it millions of pounds.But, it added, it would contest those cases that “we believe are without merit or where we are not responsible.”Two weeks ago, a High Court judge, Geoffrey Vos, ordered the “rolling disclosure” of tens of thousands of potentially damning News of the World e-mails to potential hacking victims. He has also ordered the police to release pertinent information to potential victims. It is unclear how many people were made targets by News of the World, but some estimates have put the figure in the thousands.Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament who has been a vocal critic of News International, said that the company had little choice but to try to settle. But the offer was “hardly the end of it,” he said.“There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other victims involved,” he said in an interview. “And they’ve just got a lot of unanswered questions hanging in the air, and we are going to keep going until we get those questions answered.”Mark Lewis, a lawyer for several of the people suing the company, said some plaintiffs were likely to accept “reasonable” offers from the company.“The difficulty will be that without the full truth, it’s difficult to assess the offer,” he said in an interview. “If you don’t know how many times your phone was hacked, it’s hard to know whether an offer is acceptable.”Speaking of News of the World, Mr. Lewis said that some of the hacking cases that the paper was offering to settle were so blatant that “the only people who didn’t know were their readers.”The case dates back to 2006, when two men — the News of the World’s royal reporter, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator working for the paper named Glenn Mulcaire — were charged with illegally intercepting voice-mail messages from the cellphones of aides to members of the royal family.The two were jailed the following year, and that seemed to be that. But in 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported that several people, including the former chief executive of the Football Association, had been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by News International to settle claims that their voice-mail messages, too, had been hacked.An article in The New York Times Magazine last summer quoted current and former employees of News of the World as saying that hacking had been endemic at the paper, describing a culture where reporters were encouraged to use any means possible to get stories. Since then, more and more possible victims have come forward, many after being alerted to possible hacking by their cellphone companies.In January, News of the World dismissed its assistant editor for news, Ian Edmondson, after court papers showed that the name “Ian” had been written in the phone-hacking notes of Mr. Mulcaire, the formerly jailed investigator. Soon after, Andy Coulson, who was editor of News of the World during the period that the hacking is said to have occurred, resigned from his new job, as Prime Minister David Cameron’s chief spokesman, saying that the case was proving too much of a distraction.He has not been directly linked to any wrongdoing.Until recently, News of the World seemed reluctant to pursue the matter. But that has changed in the last few months. In March, for example, executives at the newspaper said they had suddenly unearthed millions of employee e-mails that they had claimed were somehow lost by their Internet provider en route to storage in India.They vowed to pass any relevant material to the police.Meanwhile, the police have been embarrassed by the case, facing accusations that they dragged their feet and failed to conduct a thorough investigation.They have since reopened the investigation, led by new officers who have promised to robustly identify any wrongdoers. At the same time, prosecutors are conducting an inquiry into what went wrong in the initial police operation. News International’s statement today relates only to the civil litigation.Earlier this week, two News of the World journalists — Mr. Edmondson, the former assistant editor, and Neville Thurlbeck, the paper’s chief reporter — were arrested on suspicion of phone hacking. They were questioned, released and ordered to present themselves to the police for further questioning in the fall.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','The case is the latest in a string of criminal investigations into illegal marketing practices by drug and device makers. Companies have repeatedly settled allegations that they paid kickbacks to doctors in the United States to induce them to prescribe drugs for, or implant medical devices in, patients who are unaware of their doctors’ financial incentives.With the settlement agreement from Johnson & Johnson, prosecutors have now begun penalizing companies in foreign bribery cases as well. Some top executives in the drug industry have suggested in recent months that the industry’s marketing practices may need to undergo wholesale changes.According to statements by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribes paid to foreign government officials, because doctors in many other countries are government employees.For Johnson & Johnson, the settlement comes at a difficult time. The company has issued more than 50 product recalls since the start of last year involving such household brands as Tylenol, Motrin, Rolaids and Benadryl. Last year, it recalled two popular hip implants that a recent study suggested might fail soon after surgery in close to half of the patients who received them.Mr. Weldon has denied that the company’s many missteps suggest broader problems in management or in the company’s structure as a set of loosely affiliated subsidiaries.Also on Friday, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $7.9 million to settle bribery allegations with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. And it admitted as part of its deferred prosecution agreement with the United States government to having paid kickbacks to the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein under a United Nations oil-for-food program that investigations have since found was rife with fraud.According to a criminal complaint here and a case summary in Britain, Johnson & Johnson undertook an elaborate scheme to pay about 20 percent of the price of the company’s devices to Greek surgeons.Such bribes were so routine in Greece, according to the document, that an accountant for the company’s Greek sales agent had trouble understanding why he had to disguise the purpose of the money in his statements to Johnson & Johnson.A December 2001 e-mail from a top Johnson & Johnson executive stated that he was “very disappointed to read in your proposal references” to bribes “which cannot be mentioned in written correspondence.” Executives debated how to bring its bribes into compliance with the law, with one executive writing, “when we abandon the consultancy, we might as well abandon the business.”The company also paid bribes to Polish doctors and administrators who served on hospital committees that made purchasing decisions for medical equipment. Some of the bribes included paying for travel arrangements for doctors to attend medical conferences, a common practice throughout the industry. The company also bribed doctors in Romania who prescribed the company’s drugs.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','BERLIN — After breaking ranks with its allies by refusing last month to support the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing military action in Libya, Germany is now prepared to let its troops take part if the United Nations asks the European Union to help provide humanitarian aid to Libyan civilians.The policy shift, announced by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on Thursday night, reflects disarray in Germany’s strategy but an awareness that its standing among its allies was damaged when Mr. Westerwelle told the country’s ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from the vote.Germany later withdrew ships from NATO command in the Mediterranean because Mr. Westerwelle did not want the country’s forces caught up in the fighting.The decisions were viewed with immense disappointment by the United States and other NATO allies and criticized by leading conservative lawmakers belonging to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party.And while German opposition parties supported Mr. Westerwelle’s decision not to involve any troops in the Libyan military operation, there were also many dissenting voices among their ranks.'"
"'11-04-09,'0','Blake Hutchinson, an oil field services analyst at Howard Weil, said that the markets had “written off” Libyan production. Reports of damage to oil fields have heightened fears that output could be disrupted for longer than initially forecast, possibly for years.“When you kill an oil field, sometimes you kill it for good,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “You have gone from production offline” to production that might never exist again.Mr. Routt of KBC said that “until we get a technical assessment of the damage, we are not going to know what the impact is going to be, and until we get that knowledge the markets are running ahead of themselves.”Since the beginning of the turmoil in Libya, Saudi Arabia, along with its gulf neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have raised production to offset the loss of Libyan oil exports.But the increase has done nothing to dampen oil prices, the KBC analysis said, because traders are worried about the political stability of many Middle Eastern states, which are among the largest producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Stock prices closed moderately lower on Friday as investors monitored energy and currency markets.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.44 points, or 0.24 percent, at 12,380.05, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 5.34 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,328.17.

"'11-04-09,'0','Mr. Rehn said that he was “confident that Portugal will match its refinancing needs in April and May, while June will be more challenging.”For that reason he hoped to have agreement on the new bailout package in time for E.U. finance ministers to consider it at their next regular meeting, on May 16.The starting point will be the austerity measures on which Mr. Socrates failed to secure an agreement in the Portuguese Parliament before he was forced to ask for a bailout. “It is essential that we will also talk with the parties of opposition,” Mr. Rehn added.Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who chairs the group of euro-zone finance ministers, said there were assurances from the caretaker government and the main opposition party that they remain committed to agreed deficit reduction targets. These would cut the Portuguese budget deficit — which hit 8.6 percent of gross domestic product last year — to 4.6 percent in 2011, 3 percent in 2012 and 2 percent in 2013.While Mr. Rehn said that the total finance that will be made available by the E.U. and the I.M.F. would be “in the magnitude of around €80 billion,” he said it was too early to specify how much of that would be set aside for repairing Portugual’s financial sector.If confirmed at €80 billion, the aid would be smaller on a per capita basis than the total size of similar packages negotiated with Ireland and Greece.Klaus Regling, who heads the eurozone’s €440 billion rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, said that the Portuguese bailout request had helped to reduce the risk of contagion to other countries, most notably Spain, by ring-fencing the euro’s three weaker economies.“In general the markets today understand much better the economic fundamentals in the different member states in the euro area and that is the reason why the risk of contagion is much less than six or nine months ago,” he said at the news conference with Mr. Rehn.The Dutch finance minister Jan Kees de Jager said at the meeting that the assistance for Portugal would represent the last bailout in the region. “The other countries are on the safe side,” he said, according to Bloomberg News.News of the bailout this week helped Portuguese banking stocks, but has done nothing to lower Portugal’s borrowing costs. Yields on Portuguese bonds pushed higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield up 5 basis points at 8.43 percent on Friday, although yields on equivalent German bonds rose by a similar amount.The euro pushed higher Friday. It was quoted at $1.4435 in late London trading, from $1.4308 late Thursday. The currency has benefited from the European Central Bank’s decision Thursday to lift interest rates in the region.'"

"'11-04-10,'0','SANA, Yemen — Clashes broke out late Saturday evening between security forces and demonstrators here, killing one protester and wounding 15, doctors said at a field hospital at the site.Security forces opened fire, said witnesses, in the first direct assault on protesters in the capital since snipers killed 52 protesters more than three weeks ago. The shooting follows a week of violence in a central city, Taiz, where security forces and men in plain clothes have fatally shot about 20 protesters.Saturday’s violence began after a group of about 400 protesters tried to march to the presidential palace late in the evening. They were stopped at a major intersection by security forces about a half-mile away from their main sit-in area.After an hour of a tense standoff, gunfire started. Plainclothesmen, wielding guns, were standing around the police, and had surrounded the area where the protesters had broken off from the main protest site. Two water cannons also pounded the area.The demonstrators had wandered out of an area where soldiers under Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsin al-Ahmar, a top military leader who broke with the government last month, guarded the protesters.After the gunfire started, the protesters temporarily scattered, though some returned, chanting “Peaceful, Peaceful” and “There is no God but Allah.”“At first they shot into the air, and then they shot at us,” said Mustafa Amrany, a 14-year-old boy, who was lying on the floor of a nearby mechanic’s shop after being exposed to tear gas. He said: “I am not young. I am here with the protest,” while Ismael Mohamed, the mechanic, poured water over his burning eyes. Before the violence erupted Saturday, the atmosphere was tense, and periodically the protesters yelled out taunts at the security forces.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','The couple has since expanded to four bays in the south building, and with expansion has come collaboration. A photographer upstairs shoots all of the chocolatiers’ pictures, and a graphic designer next door helps create marketing materials.“You’ve got a neighbor,” said Jacky Recchiuti, joking that she could knock on someone’s door to ask for a cup of sugar. “People are willing to help each other out.”On a late winter afternoon, the south building resembles a dorm hall, with giggling tenants running from unit to unit, brushing against posters promoting art shows. The dense scent of the Recchiutis’ baking chocolate creeps down the concrete halls.Since the Recchiutis moved into the A.I.C. nearly 15 years ago, several other notable food ventures have joined them: the New American restaurant Serpentine, the high-end sandwich and catering company Kitchenette, and the ice cream shop Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, to name a few. It’s where Kika’s Treats produces artisanal baked goods. It’s where Sutton Cellars has set up an appointment-only wine business, and where the next Magnolia Brewery will be opening later this year.Startup-friendly environments are nothing new to San Francisco, and collective workspaces including Kicklabs, Dogpatch Labs and i/o Ventures are thriving. While most are dominated by Internet-related businesses, others have branched out into other industries, notably food, in the case of La Cocina, based in the Mission district, and social entrepreneurship, in the case of the Hub in SoMa.Some provide business services and formal support arrangements — the traditional business incubator model — that are not offered at A.I.C. Common among all, however, is the notion that new businesses can benefit from a physical community of like-minded ventures.James Monsees, 31, started Ploom, a company that manufactures devices to vaporize tobacco, five years ago with a Stanford classmate. As he sucked on one of his devices and blew vapor doughnuts one recent afternoon, Mr. Monsees gestured toward the exposed H.V.A.C. system bisecting the ceiling of his lofted office. He described how Ploom split its heating and cooling bills with other tenants.Neighboring Revision3, for example, an Internet video production company started by Kevin Rose, the founder of the social site Digg.com, requires a lot of energy to cool its servers, despite the normally low temperatures of the former industrial space, Mr. Monsees said. Ploom needs only to heat its space and thanks to a water pump system installed on the roof, the heat generated by powering the air-conditioners at Revision3 can be recycled to keep the workers at Ploom warm.Dave McLean, the owner of Magnolia Gastropub and Brewery and the Alembic Bar on Haight Street, is also excited about working with his neighbors.“We already have some fun things planned with Sutton Cellars,” Mr. McLean, 41, said, adding, “Collaboration is one of the really exciting aspects of the food and beverage communities right now.”""I particularly love the way great cities re-imagine and reinvent themselves, or parts of themselves, while retaining the character that makes them unique,"" Mr. McLean said. ""To me, that is a spirit that is very evident in the Dogpatch and the A.I.C., and I’d like to be part of that.”'"
"'11-04-10,'0','In the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 ruling about a school-choice program in Arizona, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s opinion leaves intact a program that has disbursed almost $350 million of state funds, most of it to schools choosing students on the basis of religion.The holding all but overrules a landmark decision of the Warren court, Flast v. Cohen. As Justice Elena Kagan says powerfully in her first dissent, “by ravaging Flast in this way,” the majority “damages one of this nation’s defining constitutional commitments.”The First Amendment’s establishment clause — “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion” — is meant to protect citizens even when they are not harmed. Before, under Flast, a taxpayer could ask a court to enforce this central right. Now, under this ruling, a taxpayer all but can’t, and any government can use the tax system to avoid challenges to financing of religion.The only difference between cases considered under Flast since 1968 and the current one is the means of government spending. In past cases, it has come through appropriations. In this case, the money comes through a tax credit: any taxpayer can redirect up to $500 of what he or she owes the state to a nonprofit that uses the money for scholarships. What the court calls a tax credit and Arizona calls a voluntary cash contribution is, concretely, a redirected tax payment.Justice Kennedy, in an opinion clearly intended to overturn legal precedent, says that the program’s financing comes from taxpayers taking advantage of this credit, not from the state, so the taxpayers bringing the lawsuit can claim no harm from the state and lacked standing to sue. To Justice Kagan, “this novel distinction,” has “as little basis in principle as it has in our precedent.” Whether a state finances a program with cash grants or targeted tax breaks, the effect is the same. Taxpayers bear the cost.Since the Flast case, she writes, “no court — not one — has differentiated between these sources of financing in deciding about standing.” In five cases where taxpayers challenged tax expenditures, the court has dealt with the merits “without questioning the plaintiffs’ standing.” The court has relied on some of these decisions as “exemplars of jurisdiction” in other cases. (“Pause on that for a moment,” the justice entreats.)'"
"'11-04-10,'0','In “Who Could Blame G.E.?” (column, April 5), Joe Nocera says America’s corporations have a fiduciary duty to maximize profit for their shareholders. Who says so? This has become the modern mantra of business-school professors and chief executives. But the corporation is not chartered by the shareholders. It is chartered by the state. The state charters corporations because it believes they may provide benefits to the society and not just to the shareholders.It is interesting to note that as recently as the 1980s, the Business Roundtable’s chief executive mission statement asserted that the chief executive had a duty to care for customers, employees, communities and the nation (the stakeholders, in other words) as well as the shareholders.This mission statement was changed in the mid-1990s to conform to the present shareholder value fetish. General Electric and other corporations that practice this fetish do so at their own and the country’s long-term peril.The writer, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, was counselor to the secretary of commerce in the Reagan administration.Joe Nocera’s column demonstrates a mentality that America’s large budget deficit is someone else’s problem. Surely, executives at General Electric like Jeffrey R. Immelt, who now serves in the Obama administration, would happily lecture about the need to reduce the deficit on the backs of someone else.Mr. Nocera asks how can you blame G.E. for creatively reducing its tax bill to almost zero thanks to extensive lobbying and its 1,000-person tax department. He suggests that avoiding taxes is as American as apple pie, but isn’t doing the right thing supposed to be American as well?Saying you are for deficit reduction is easy, but making the personal sacrifice required to actually do something about the problem is a lot harder. G.E. could be a role model of civic responsibility instead of a model of what not to do. As we ask the poorest among us to make sacrifices to balance the budget, it’s only fair that the biggest among us, like corporations and hedge fund managers, pay their fair share of taxes.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','LISBON — Portugal’s political feuding continued to play a role in the nation’s efforts to seek relief from mounting debt. The caretaker Socialist government dismissed a European Union request that all of the country’s main political parties take part in negotiating the terms of a bailout package.Speaking at a meeting of European finance ministers in Hungary, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs, said Friday that international creditors expected Portugal’s government to take the lead in negotiating the conditions for a bailout, but that “it is essential that we also speak to the opposition parties.” He emphasized on Saturday that bringing debt under control was essential to European growth.The European Union wants to ensure that Portugal’s main factions have signed off on the terms being negotiated now, so that it does not have to renegotiate after a new government is chosen in the general elections June 5.However, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, Portugal’s finance minister, separately insisted to reporters that “it is not for the government to negotiate with the opposition.”José Sócrates, the Socialist prime minister, is at the helm of a caretaker government after resigning last month when center-right opposition lawmakers rejected his austerity package. As the election approaches, with politicians on both sides of the political divide now blaming the others for forcing the country to seek international assistance. It is expected that Portugal will need about 80 billion euros, or $116 billion, in aid.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','My father-in-law picked me up for the interview from the Miami airport and drove me to the hotel. But when we found that it was an hourly rental, he refused to leave me there. I later found there were two hotels with the same name, and we’d gone to the wrong one.I was hired and sent to set up trim-a-tree shops at store locations, where I made my share of mistakes. I began to realize that spending my days in stockrooms wasn’t for me. So, 11 months later, we moved to Atlanta, where I found a job at the Atlanta Merchandise Mart as a secretary for a firm representing major household brands.At 26, I teamed up with another female representative, and we combined our last names to form Judd Miller & Company, to represent manufacturers. When we started in 1982, there were almost no women in this business. No bank would lend us money to get started, so we borrowed $15,000 from my father.We were successful, but I wanted a new challenge. So in 1988, I started a business with a small pottery-making shop. I named it “Mud Pie” because the pottery was painted brown to resemble terra cotta.Mud Pie soon became a top-selling giftware line for Macy’s. We started with a dozen items, including ducks, rabbits and chicks. In 1991, I acquired my business partner’s share, and five years later was introduced to manufacturing in China, where the factories could make whatever I could dream up. We now design and make more than 4,000 baby, tabletop and fashion gifts.With my husband as C.F.O., we have grown to 85 employees in the United States and 100 in our overseas office. Last year, we partnered with Lineage Capital, which took a minority stake in Mud Pie, and have begun selling directly to customers through a new Web site.I suffered a major setback in a 2007 accident, when a dump truck backed up and struck me while I was crossing the street near the Atlanta Merchandise Mart. For a year, my caregiver drove me to work and my husband took me home. Some five surgeries later — including a partial elbow replacement — and with a spinal cord stimulator to ease the pain, I am doing well.Work was a great impetus to get better, but the accident made me realize that life is short and I needed to accelerate my interest in giving back to the community. So, my husband and I set up a family foundation to help meet urgent needs, like housing and food, of families here and abroad.'"

No. No organization is,” Mr. Cox went on. “Are we always trying to improve? Every organization is.”The Haggler noted that for years, members of the Better Business Bureau were not allowed to publicize their membership, for fear that it would tempt the organization into pay-to-play shenanigans. Why not go back to those old-school rules?Mr. Cox did not exactly leap at this suggestion. Instead, he noted that a survey of people who used the Web site had found that 85 percent of respondents felt that the organization’s ratings were helpful, and that 88 percent felt that they were fair. Yes, he added, the survey was paid for by the Better Business Bureau.“Can you go out and find other issues that are head-scratching?” he asked, referring to previous Haggler columns. “I guarantee you can do that. On the whole, though, I think we’re doing pretty well. But I’m not satisfied with pretty good. We’ve got to do better.”One theory about the Better Business Bureau’s current rash of troubles — it’s been criticized on “20/20” and in other newspapers — is that the organization is facing a serious threat from opinion Web sites, like Yelp, where consumers can post their own ratings and positive and negative reviews.The Haggler related to Mr. Cox a recent Yelp experience of his own. A company, which for the sake of mercy shall not be named here, recently installed some window shades in the Haggler’s Cave of Justice — a k a, his home — and after some confusion about price, a rather stunning conversation with a salesman at the company ensued. We’ll skip the details, but the Haggler opened with a benign, “I think we have a disagreement about cost,” to which the salesman responded, “You misled me!” and promptly hung up the phone.A withering review was posted on Yelp. The next day, the owner of the company e-mailed to ask what it would take to have that review taken down. The Haggler asked the owner to double-check the cost of the shades, and for an apology from the salesman.The next day, a partial refund and remorseful e-mail from Mr. You Misled Me! were both issued. Down came the review.CONTRAST this with the experience of readers who’ve been e-mailing the Haggler to report their lengthy and ultimately futile attempts to agitate through the Better Business Bureau. How, the Haggler asked, can Mr. Cox and the 120 bureaus across the country compete?“We fully recognize that our complaint system needs to be simplified and it needs to be streamlined,” Mr. Cox said. He noted that the bureau provides ratings of its own, which is quite a different service than a free-for-all of opinions. Mr. Cox was conciliatory at other moments, but politely stood firm on the basics of the bureau’s  economic model. Which, the Haggler would argue, makes “head-scratchers” totally inevitable.And so we wrap up this four-column series with a solemn vow. In the past, the Haggler has cited Better Business Bureau ratings to suggest that a given company is either beloved or despised by the public.Oopsy daisy. That will never happen again.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','But Disney is giving another chance to Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Dr. Teeth, the Swedish Chef, Beaker and those balcony blowhards, Statler and Waldorf. This time, there is no talk of new tie-in theme park rides, TV specials, elaborate lines of related merchandise or the other trappings of a companywide franchise. This time, it all boils down to making a hit movie.Scheduled for release at Thanksgiving, a marquee position on Hollywood’s calendar, “The Muppets” hopes to reboot the property by doubling down on signature attributes: irreverent, even biting humor; catchy song-and-dance numbers; and chaotic, unexpected story lines that can ricochet from dancing chickens to stand-up comedians to pigs in space. (The film will be up against “Arthur Christmas,” an animated movie from Sony about Santa’s high-tech operations at the North Pole.)“You have to walk a careful line between respectful and reverential,” said Leslie B. Stern, a Disney stalwart who has been given oversight for rejuvenating the Muppets characters. “Make it feel contemporary, but do it in a way that preserves what made these characters so engaging and endearing in the first place.”CERTAIN rules of Muppetdom were forgotten or bent too often over time, people behind the new film say. One is that the characters play best when they are playing themselves. Flops like “The Muppet Christmas Carol” and “Muppet Treasure Island” put the critters into classic tales, losing the verve that came from the TV series and the first movie — in which Rowlf the piano-playing dog was just a piano-playing dog, and audiences loved it.By Henson’s design, the Muppets are supposed to live in the real world, steadfastly believe that they are alive and — this is a biggie — play to an adult audience. He was so insistent that his non-“Sesame Street” stars embody a grown-up personality and tone that he gave this title to the 1975 pilot that would introduce them: “The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence.”“People started to forget that the Muppets were never designed as children’s entertainment,” said Todd Lieberman, a producer of the new film. (Kermit, created in 1955, is the only character who appeared regularly on both “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show.”)Keeping all that in mind, Disney, which has owned the Muppets since 2004, assembled an unusual creative team known for cheeky, offbeat humor. Nick Stoller and Jason Segel, whose experience largely comes from R-rated comedies like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Get Him to the Greek,” wrote the screenplay. The director is James Bobin, a movie first-timer whose television writing and directing credits include the HBO series “Flight of the Conchords” and “Da Ali G Show.”The film, with a budget of just under $50 million, follows a small-town couple (Amy Adams and Mr. Segel) as they take a young Muppet named Walter — a new creation — to Los Angeles. They are on a hunt for the famous Muppet Studios, largely because the iPhone-toting Walter hasn’t quite sorted out his identity.After finding the studio, they go on a tour — Alan Arkin plays the cranky guide — and find the place “run-down and for the most part abandoned,” Mr. Lieberman said. (Sound familiar?) But Kermit & Company decide to fix all that by reuniting the gang, Blues Brothers-style, for an old-fashioned variety show fund-raiser that saves the studio from a villain named Tex Richman, played by Chris Cooper, who thinks he can smell oil under the famous Muppet Theater.The filming of a big song-and-dance number shut down Hollywood Boulevard for two days. The movie eventually involves at least 100 Muppet characters and as many hip cameos as Mr. Stoller and Mr. Segel could fit into the script.In an outpouring of good will, some of Hollywood’s brightest young stars have lined up behind reviving the Muppets with a film that is, appropriately, about reviving the Muppets. Over the last several months, Ricky Gervais, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis, Jack Black and two dozen or so peers have flocked to rented stages on the Universal Studios lot for roles.“Pretty much the best day of my entire life,” said Ms. Blunt, who, in a reprisal of her character in “The Devil Wears Prada,” plays an assistant to Miss Piggy, who is the editrix of Vogue Paris.  “Everyone who was on that set just walked away giddy,” Ms. Blunt added. “It was like touching your childhood.”Like a lot of aging people in Hollywood, the Muppets were pretty much sitting on a shelf at Disney when Mr. Segel visited the studio in 2008 to talk about projects after his full-frontal moment in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” Mr. Segel suggested a Muppet movie, and Disney was open-minded.Mr. Stoller signed on to a team that includes Mr. Lieberman and his business partner David Hoberman, perhaps best known lately as producers behind “The Fighter.” Ms. Adams, a star of that film, joined “The Muppets” one night over dinner, Mr. Lieberman said.“As it turned out, nostalgia for the brand went way beyond our little circle,” he said of the unusual wave of interest that eventually swept celebrity after celebrity into the project. In a single scene, Whoopi Goldberg, James Carville, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch and Selena Gomez all make cameos, according to producers.“This is the first Muppet production of any size that is really being spearheaded by fans instead of hard-core Muppet professionals,” said Lisa Henson, Jim Henson’s daughter and chief executive of the Henson Company.Her father, who died in 1990, often worked with stars of less wattage. For human accompaniment, his creations sometimes made do with Ruth Buzzi’s mugging or Charles Aznavour’s whispering in French the phone number of a Paris garbage dump to an adoring Miss Piggy.But the musical numbers, sight gags and very unexpected moments — what to make of Rita Moreno and a dancing Muppet brutally slamming each other around the stage? — worked its way into the psyche of a generation. By Mr. Stoller’s reckoning, the Muppets stand alongside Woody Allen, “Saturday Night Live” and “The Simpsons” as pillars of contemporary comic style.“Muppets are the gateway drug for comedy writers,” said Mr. Stoller, who is in his mid-30s and recalls becoming addicted at an early age to the random capers, the vaudevillian flair and the mean old men who, from a perch in the balcony, were the show’s interlocutors.Given that generational influence, it is all the more puzzling that the Muppets became a diminishing presence even as newly invented creatures who seemed to share their spirit — like Shrek, from DreamWorks Animation — took center stage. At a time when prebranded characters are Hollywood’s treasured assets, how were the Muppets allowed to slip into such a state?Kermit’s fortunes started to fade with a bungled sale after Henson’s death. Disney had been on the verge of buying the Jim Henson Company. But Henson’s heirs — after a period of trying, with mixed success, to run the Muppets themselves — ultimately made a richer deal with the German media company EM.TV and Merchandising.EM.TV, which paid $680 million for the characters, would later have financial problems, and in 2003 sold the Muppets back to the Henson children for $78 million. The family later sold the Muppets to Disney while retaining the rights to other Henson creations like the Fraggles. (Sesame Workshop owns “Sesame Street” and related characters.)At that point, Disney started its cycle of on-again-off-again efforts to put the Muppets back to work.Speaking by telephone in February, Ms. Henson noted that the Muppets had been handled well enough to get them through a half-dozen films — no mean feat. Disney declined to discuss its previous labors, but Ms. Stern said it was pleased with the success of several viral videos made in recent years to keep a pilot light on for the franchise, particularly one where the characters perform Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.”Indeed, the popularity of that video, which has been viewed almost 20 million times on YouTube since late 2009, was a reason that Disney had confidence that the Muppets — half marionettes, half puppets — hadn’t lost relevance in an age of computer animation.MS. HENSON has no connection to the new film, though many old Muppet hands are working on it. (After being reminded that Muppets believe they are living beings, not puppets, Mr. Segel decided to delete a scene in which Walter, yearning to become a Muppet, practices as a ventriloquist’s dummy.) But Ms. Henson said the family, at long last, likes the direction Disney is going.“We hoped they would be willing to make a really expensive, major-movie-star Muppet movie,” she said.Mr. Hoberman, the producer, is likely to disagree with “expensive,” but he does concede that “The Muppets” has been made to have the kind of big, sprawling vibe that can create new fans and draw back older ones. “We are aware of the responsibility here,” he said. “We are appealing to everyone, young and old.”'"
"'11-04-10,'0','“The shooting went on for almost two hours; it was frightening,” said one resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. There was no immediate word on casualties.Latakia is significant because it lies in a province that has strong historic ties to the minority Alawite sect of President Bashar al-Assad.As the wave of protests gathers steam, Mr. Assad has offered some concessions, like firing local officials and forming committees to look into replacing the country’s despised emergency laws.On Saturday, he asked a court to investigate the former governor of the Dara’a region, Faisal Kalthoum, and a former security officer, Atef Najib, for their role in handling protests in the city, a security official said. Mr. Assad fired Mr. Kalthoum last month.Those gestures have failed to appease a growing movement that is raising its demands for concrete reforms and free elections in a country that has been ruled by Mr. Assad’s family for more than 40 years.On Friday, witnesses said security forces opened fire on tens of thousands of protesters in Dara’a, killing 25 people and wounding hundreds. The government said that 19 police officers and members of the security forces were killed when gunmen opened fire.Neither account could be independently verified. But the government’s claim of casualties could signal plans for a stronger crackdown. State television showed what it said were vandals setting fire to the radio and television building in Dara’a and gunmen shooting randomly in the central city of Homs.Also on Saturday, the editor of the state-run newspaper Tishrin was fired after giving an interview to the satellite station Al Jazeera in which she held the security forces responsible for the violence in Dara’a on Friday.An official at the newspaper confirmed Saturday that the editor, Samira Masalmeh, was fired because of the interview.More than 170 people have been killed since the protests began in earnest last month, human rights groups say.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','“The industry stinks,” says Robert L. Rodriguez, the chief executive of First Pacific Advisors, whose FPA Capital fund declined 34 percent in 2008, but rebounded by 53 percent in 2009 and 24 percent last year.Disillusioned investors are leaving some fund families that were once considered paragons of lifetime investing. Investors have withdrawn billions of dollars from domestic stock market mutual funds for four consecutive years. And they have shifted hundreds of billions of dollars out of actively managed stock funds, which last year charged fees averaging 97 cents for every $100 invested on an asset-weighted basis, and put more into index funds, which charged an average of just 16 cents per $100.Index funds, of course, don’t try to beat the market. They basically are the market, as defined by a certain index, like the S.& P. 500 or some sector benchmark. These funds, which are known as passive, rather than active, investments, today account for 23 percent of the $6.3 trillion invested in stock mutual funds. That is up from 10.5 percent a decade ago, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade group.“People have been let down by their heroes.” said Don Phillips, president for fund research at Morningstar. “They don’t believe any more.” Yet even as people embrace index funds, many are also experimenting with riskier — but potentially more lucrative — active funds, he said.CONSIDER Jerry Verseput, a former engineer at Intel who is now an independent financial adviser in Eldorado Hills, Calif. He had worried for years that many equity funds seemed to move in lock step. He was shocked when his own mutual fund investments plunged in 2007 and 2008, when the financial crisis struck. He figured that the pros would have seen the trouble coming and protected his nest egg. Wrong. So he took control by putting $500,000 of his personal fund investments into exchange-traded funds, a fast-growing breed of index funds that can be bought and sold like stocks.As Mr. Verseput altered his own investing strategy, he also shifted the $22 million of investments that he manages for 70 clients, many of them Intel employees, to exchange-traded funds from active funds. “I was able to sleep better at night,” he said.Despite its often lackluster performance, the mutual fund industry remains lucrative and powerful. It is the bedrock of many people’s retirement plans: individual retirement accounts or employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans provide nearly $4.5 trillion of the industry’s $12.1 trillion in assets under management.And the industry’s reach may soon grow if lawmakers and regulators in several states facing shortfalls in public employee pension funds move into 401(k)-type retirement savings plans.The industry has given investors a dizzying array of more than 7,600 mutual funds from which to choose. But by last July, about half of the investors who put money into United States equity funds over the preceding 10 years were sitting on losses of more than 20 percent, according to an analysis of market performance and investor flows by Trim Tabs, a research company.Since last August, as the stock market has rallied, many funds have moved back into positive territory. That gain can be explained by dividend income from shares held in funds and has little to do with stock appreciation, Trim Tabs says.The Investment Company Institute challenges Trim Tabs’ conclusions and aspects of the method behind its calculations, saying it makes assumptions that do not accurately reflect the behavior of the average investor.The losses over the years, of course, are not all the funds’ fault. Investors are often their own worst enemies. Many people tend to jump in and out of funds at precisely the wrong moments.But the industry has enabled this behavior by minting new funds to attract investor dollars.Critics of the industry argue that many fund companies are more focused on gathering assets than on managing them. For funds, one incentive is clear: more assets mean more fees. Fund managers charge investors a percentage of the assets they have under management.Critics point to the industry’s penchant for introducing funds that attract investors chasing red-hot markets — though often just before these markets turn down. In 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom, mutual fund companies created 84 funds focused on technology stocks. Subsequently, the tech bubble burst.Throughout 2010, the mutual fund industry marketed bond funds and attracted about $251 billion into them. But that inflow occurred even as interest rates had already fallen close to zero and many economists were forecasting a decline in the bond market. In fact, prices have fallen since late last year.Similarly last year, American investors plowed $57 billion into mutual funds investing in overseas equity markets. Since November, however, those markets have been volatile.And after eight consecutive months of withdrawals from United States equity funds, investors jumped back in recently, adding about $21 billion in January and February. Of course, by then, the market had been rallying for months.Investors’ moves out of active funds have had startling effects on the industry. Several once-dominant fund companies have lost billions of dollars in assets under management.Putnam Investments, the fourth-largest mutual fund company in 2000, has lost nearly three-quarters of its assets, or about $200 billion, in the past decade, through weak market performance and investor withdrawals. Janus Capital, another firm that enjoyed a high profile a decade ago, has lost nearly half of its assets, or $100 billion.Even the giant Fidelity Investments was unseated last year for the first time in two decades as the nation’s largest mutual fund family. It was surpassed by Vanguard, which is known for index funds and had $1.4 trillion in assets under management.“People gave up on beating the market,” said Loren Fox, a senior analyst at Strategic Insight, a research and data company in New York. “Investors said to themselves, ‘It’s so hard to beat the S.& P. 500, so I am just going to own the S.& P. 500.’ ”James Aber, a spokesman for Janus, said Janus learned valuable lessons in the bear market in the start of the past decade. “We believe we’ve become a better firm because of it,” he said. “We’ve enhanced our valuation discipline, implemented better risk controls, and we now have a larger and more experienced research team.”Like Janus, Putnam grew quickly during the tech stock boom, roughly doubling in size between 1999 and 2000, according to Putnam’s chief executive, Robert L. Reynolds. When the collapse came, fund companies that were heavily invested in technology and telecommunications stocks were hit hard, he said.Mr. Reynolds said investors haven’t abandoned actively managed funds. “Everything we see from clients says there’s still tremendous demand for actively managed funds, which give investors the ability to outperform the markets,” he said.Brian Reid, the Investment Company Institute’s chief economist, said that while some money had left United States stock market mutual funds, outflows from August 2007 to December 2010 amounted to only 7 percent of total assets in them. That means 93 percent of assets remained.Mr. Reid said that there was a growing preference among investors for index funds, but that this shift probably had more to do with low costs than with other funds’ poor performance.He said that while index funds were cheaper than active funds, that fact overlooked extra charges passed on by financial advisers to clients for actively managing the mix of the various index funds in their portfolios.“I don’t believe that most people today believe in true passive management,” he said. “They want active management, just active management of index funds. That is an important shift.”Nevertheless, it is a steep fall from grace for the mutual fund industry, which was once the darling of investors and introduced many people to the markets and the idea of investing in stocks.Although the first mutual funds were created in the mid-1920s, the industry heyday began in the 1970s with the introduction of I.R.A.’s and employer-sponsored 401(k) defined-contribution retirement plans. By 1980, about 4.6 million United States households invested in mutual funds; today, some 51 million households do, or nearly 44 percent of the country.FOR much of the 1980s and 1990s, as the market boomed, so did investor flows into mutual funds. It was the era of the star stock picker, as Peter Lynch of Fidelity and Michael Price of the Mutual Series posted eye-popping returns and developed rock-star cult status among investors.As the tech boom turbo-charged stocks in the mid-1990s, a new generation of aggressive stock celebrities and fund companies emerged, and investors flocked to them.“ ‘Hot’ managers were treated like Hollywood stars and marketed in the same fashion,” said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, in a speech in January at the American Museum of Finance on Wall Street.Mr. Bogle, long a critic of active fund management, used the speech to chide the industry. “As the inevitable reversion to the mean in fund performance came into play,” he said, “these stars proved more akin to comets.”'"
"'11-04-10,'0','Still, while Africa and the Middle East have lately drawn greater interest from mutual fund investors, they represent only a sliver of overall investment, said Gregg Wolper, an analyst at Morningstar. “Frontier funds get a lot of attention but not that much money,” he said. “And the emerging-market funds don’t have that much money in Egypt for the most part.” The country’s companies account for only about 1 percent of MSCI’s Emerging Markets Index.Some portfolio managers who follow emerging and frontier markets have watched the recent events with cautious optimism. The consensus is that less-experienced investors will shun Africa and the Middle East in the short term, depressing stock values, but that this may present longer-term opportunities for more patient prospectors.“Some people are going to sell indiscriminately,” said Larry Seruma, manager of the Nile Pan Africa fund. “And I don’t think the uncertainty will be resolved in the next six months.”When fear dissipates, the potential for good returns should rebound. “I’ve been doing emerging-markets investing for 20 years,” said Donald E. Elefson, co-lead portfolio manager of the Harding Loevner Frontier Emerging Markets fund. “I’ve seen the Brazilian crisis, the Mexican crisis, the Russian crisis and the Asian crisis. They all pass. If you seek out quality companies — strong balance sheets, good management — those companies will survive. The only issue is how much underperformance you’ll have while waiting.”At least a few fund managers see the crisis as evidence that South Africa, not Egypt, should be central to any investing strategy that emphasizes Africa and the Middle East. Until the recent upheaval, Egypt’s economic promise may have overshadowed its risks.“It’s always tempting when you see good growth, a big population and apparent stability,” said Wim-Hein Pals, head of emerging markets equities at Robeco, a money management and mutual fund company in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that oversees more than $200 billion. “You were tempted to jump on the Egypt bandwagon in 2008 or 2009. Egypt was attractively valued then. But the political angle could always be a reason for that valuation discount.”“Russia is very cheap in terms of stock prices, but the Kremlin is a black box for an outsider,” he said. “We’ve looked at Russia for decades, and still the Kremlin is a great mystery to us. So Russia deserves a discount. And Egypt is the same — it deserves its discount.”South Africa, by contrast, is sometimes overlooked because of problems like a high incidence of AIDS and crime. But from an investing perspective, those may be dwarfed by its advantages. “It’s the largest economy on the continent and a vibrant democracy, unusual for Africa,” said David A. Nadel, a manager of the Royce Global Value fund. “You have independent corporate boards, Anglo-Saxon legal standards and good dividend policies.”It is home to dozens of public companies, many with long histories and operations reaching throughout sub-Saharan Africa. “It’s a deep market with a lot of liquidity,” said Mr. Pals of Robeco. “The companies are very well managed — you have first-tier management in a developing country.”South African stocks accounted for about 14 percent of the T. Rowe Price Africa and Middle East fund at the end of February, and the fund’s manager, Joseph Rohm, was lately stocking up on shares of Shoprite Holdings, a retailer based on the Western Cape that has stores in 16 African countries. The fund also holds a stake in Naspers, a media conglomerate based in Cape Town with properties in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.“South Africa is a political miracle, and it’s been interesting for me to see how the problems in North Africa have heightened the government’s focus on the need to create jobs,” Mr. Rohm said, adding that there is huge spending on job creation in its new budget.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','“That’s how you determine what activities are critical, what can be dropped and whether some pieces can be delegated,” he says. “It will also help you decide if there are any activities you are doing more for your own satisfaction than for meeting organizational needs. People often produce reports no one looks at.”When you meet with your manager, have some options ready for dealing with your workload and frame the discussion in terms of how you can do a better job, Mr. Cohen says.Q. Is it possible you could damage your career by asking for help?A. You risk negative fallout only if you complain to your boss that you can’t handle your job. “Don’t go in there saying, ‘I have too much work’ because your boss has too much work, too,” says Joanna Broussard, president of the BizMark Group, a business development consulting firm in Chicago. “It’s much more politically astute to offer some solutions and ask for support.”And, as Ms. Zeidman says, “If you cannot complete your work and meet deadlines, you’re much more likely to suffer consequences.”Q. Is there anything you can do to lighten the load on your own, like delegating some work to colleagues?A. If you have a collaborative relationship with co-workers who do similar work, you can ask if they can help you with certain tasks, but generally it’s better to go through the chain of command, Ms. Latham says.Let your supervisor decide whether work should be delegated and to whom, because it’s possible co-workers may be busier than they seem. “You can always suggest someone else on your team that might be able to handle some of the work, but I wouldn’t directly delegate to others unless you’re specifically given that authority,” Ms. Broussard says.Q. Could it be that the way you work, rather than your workload, is to blame?A. It is possible that your problem isn’t too much work, but a lack of efficiency. Ms. Zeidman suggests keeping an interruption log to see if constant distractions — whether from people, e-mail or Facebook updates — might be why you aren’t meeting your obligations.“Let’s say you’ve planned your day but people come into your office and sit down and talk about their vacation while you need to do your budget report, or there are always crises calling you away,” she says. “It might be that it takes you an hour to settle into work in the morning.” Once you identify the things that are eating away at your time, you can tackle them by trying to stop the interruptions or getting down to work faster.It may seem paradoxical, but you can raise your efficiency by taking breaks during the day — a quick walk, a few stretches, a visit to a colleague down the hall. Just don’t use the breaks to procrastinate, Ms. Broussard says.You may also need more training or better tools to improve your efficiency, Mr. Cohen says. “Look at colleagues that do the same sorts of things you do,” he says. “Are they faster? And, if so, what tools are they using?”Q. Is there a way to prioritize tasks so the workload feels more manageable?A. Yes, by prioritizing work so you perform the toughest tasks first, Ms. Broussard says. “We tend to do the easiest and simplest things first, because we don’t want to deal with the hard stuff,” she says, “but the harder stuff is what we need to do.”To make the big projects less daunting, break them down into smaller pieces. “Sometimes,” she says, “we feel overwhelmed simply because we don’t know where to start.”'"
"'11-04-10,'0','But some strategists are bracing for an inflation jump. Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, a consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif., said he expected the numbers to rise in a little more than a year from now. “We’re talking about inflation hovering in the 4 percent area,” he said, with a risk of it moving even higher. He pointed to the flood of stimulus that’s been pumped into the economy by governments throughout the world. Some central banks overseas have already reversed course and are raising rates to keep a lid on prices. The European Central Bank made such a move last week, citing worrisome levels of inflation in food and energy costs. Even if Mr. Hsu is right, though, there is still the question of how effective stocks will be in protecting portfolios amid rising consumer prices.Historically, stocks have been regarded as a decent inflation hedge — at least relative to bonds and cash — because stock returns have outpaced inflation for most of the past century.Yet it’s not always the case. Ned Davis Research, based in Venice, Fla., recently analyzed how the market performed in different inflationary environments over the past four decades. While the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index posted double-digit gains, on average, when inflation has been between 1 percent and 4 percent, stocks fell at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent when inflation jumped to between 4 percent and 9 percent.What’s more, in periods when the inflation rate is accelerating, not all types of stocks perform the same way. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, looked at periods since 1970 when the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index was accelerating. He found eight such sustained periods, and saw that half of the 10 market sectors, on average, gained ground during those times; the others declined or were flat.Which types of equities are likely to outperform if inflation starts to heat up this time?Mr. Hsu says he thinks large, domestically based multinational companies would look attractive if inflation really took off and the dollar continued to weaken against other major currencies. Although a weaker dollar would effectively raise the cost of goods imported from overseas, it would lower prices for exports, thus benefiting the American multinationals.Another promising area is dividend-paying stocks, said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Since 1947, payouts issued by the S.& P. 500 companies have grown at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, she said, outpacing the 3.7 percent inflation rate during the period.BUT there is another reason to favor dividend payers, she said. Businesses that stand to thrive during inflationary periods are those that have the power to pass along price increases to their customers. And companies with growing dividends often have that ability. “When you think about it,” she said, “companies that have pricing power — and are thus able to maintain their profit margins — will be able to continue to raise their dividends.”Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab, said pricing power might be focused in certain sectors. Historically, “energy companies have proven they can raise prices pretty quickly at the pump if oil climbs,” he said. “On the other end of the spectrum, consumer companies have a hard time passing along price increases on things like clothes because there’s so much competition.”If inflation spikes, energy has proved to be a good place to hide. But if the discussion moves from rising inflation to hyperinflation, other defensive areas of the market like health care and utilities would seem to make sense, Mr. Stovall said. After all, no matter how expensive things become, people still need to see the doctor and turn on the lights.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','What does it mean, in the 21st century, for a Western artist to borrow heavily from aesthetic traditions of the East? It’s a question that hovers around the career retrospective “Rebecca Salter: Into the Light of Things” at the Yale Center for British Art and the pendant show “Rebecca Salter and Japan” at the Yale University Art Gallery.Ms. Salter is a British artist who spent six years, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in Kyoto, Japan, working first in ceramics before switching to two dimensions. Her canvases and works on paper — many objects here combine the two mediums — draw upon centuries-old traditions in ceramics, as well as Japanese calligraphy and woodblock prints. They also sync up, however, with Western abstraction, monochrome painting and midcentury Minimalism.“Untitled RR31” from 2009, a mixed-media work on linen, is a dark-neutral field flecked with calligraphic marks. It looks a bit like a rain-stained window, or the surface of a dark, weathered stone. Ms. Salter is interested in the Japanese concept of “wabi,” which might be translated as “simple” or “austere,” as well as “imperfect” and “transient,” and you see that idea applied throughout the show in paintings whose surfaces have been scraped and systematically worn down by the artist.Other works reveal the influence of “shibui” (“subtle,” “subdued” or “understated”) and “ma,” a notion of time and space that emphasizes the pause, or the concept of an interval. Evidence of this is both in her muted palette and compositions (more like anti-compositions), which favor extreme subtlety over any overt showiness. “Untitled K20” might be compared to a slab of lightly veined marble, and “Untitled K78” is like an animal hide with muted variations and striations occurring at careful, yet seemingly accidental intervals.Ms. Salter’s oeuvre calls to mind the work of fellow travelers like Mark Tobey, Brion Gysin, Brice Marden — and particularly Agnes Martin. At the Yale University Art Gallery, a modest installation makes this explicit. Two works, one like an abstract calligraphy, the other a near-monochrome canvas by Ms. Salter, are shown alongside modest works by Mr. Tobey and Mr. Marden and a drawing by the artist-composer John Cage that could almost double as one of his experimental music scores.Ms. Salter’s use of the grid, a staple of midcentury American and European painting, parallels Ms. Martin’s paradoxically stripped-down and visually rich canvases. “Untitled J1” is a work made by cutting up pieces of prepared paper and affixing them to a canvas in a grid formation, a technique that parallels the “cut-up” writing techniques of the Beat poets, who were also inspired by Eastern formal techniques and spiritual traditions.Western artists’ interest in all things Asian harks back to the late 17th century, with the French craze for chinoiserie, and 19th-century japonisme. The catalog stresses, however, that Ms. Salter is a proper post-Colonial: Her work demonstrates, not an Orientalist “encounter with the exotic,” but, in her words, an attempt to “finesse the bridging of the two cultures.”One area in which Ms. Salter’s retrospective seems particularly Western, however, is the installation. While her work feels designed for thoughtful meditation on singular objects, “Into the Light of Things” follows the unfortunate model of the career retrospective, in which as much work as possible is included. The result is a bit of cognitive dissonance: you feel hurried to make it through the show and see all of the work — and yet compelled to linger in front of each painting or drawing, giving it your full attention. This is particularly true when you learn that Ms. Salter spent two to three months on some of the canvases.'"

Although companies disclose grant-date values for these awards, executives have no guarantee of actually realizing these amounts. They may earn more or less, depending on stock price movements.Equilar’s analysis reports equity awards in the fiscal year they were granted. In some cases, especially in the financial sector, companies grant equity awards at the beginning of each fiscal year based on performance in the previous fiscal year. As such, the equity awards granted in a fiscal year should not necessarily be viewed as indicative of corporate performance in that year.Percentage change in pay for each executive is calculated using compensation data from the previous fiscal year. For some executives, particularly recent hires or newly promoted chief executives, their change in pay is listed as n/a, not available. Their compensation, however, is included in averages and medians for other columns.The section under the heading “Accumulated C.E.O. Wealth” includes supplemental information on equity gains and retirement plans. Stock option gains represent the value realized by an executive by exercising option awards. Stock award gains represent the market value of stock awards that vested during the year. These gains are usually based on equity awards granted in previous fiscal years. Lump-sum pension balance values represent the accumulated value of an executive’s pension plan if it was paid out all at once. Deferred-compensation balances represent the year-end balance of an executive’s deferred-compensation accounts.Following are definitions for the terms atop each column in the table:BASE SALARY Annual pay that does not depend on the company’s results.CASH BONUS The sum of discretionary and performance-based cash payments made in addition to base salary.PERKS/OTHER Miscellaneous pay, not linked to performance, that includes such disparate items as moving expenses, personal use of corporate aircraft, and the value of assorted other benefits, including contributions to 401(k) plans and company-paid premiums for supplemental life insurance.CASH PAY The sum of the base salary, cash bonus and perks/other categories.STOCK AWARDS The aggregate grant-date value of incentive plan or service-based stock and/or unit awards, as reported by the company. Incentive plan stock awards are earned for attaining predetermined goals. Service-based stock awards vest if the executive stays with the company for a set period.OPTION AWARDS The aggregate grant-date value of incentive plan or service-based awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights, as reported by the company. Incentive plan option awards are earned for attaining predetermined goals. Service-based option awards vest if the executive stays with the company for a set period.TOTAL COMPENSATION AMOUNT The sum of the cash pay, stock awards and option awards categories.TOTAL COMPENSATION CHANGE The percentage change in total compensation from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. This figure is calculated only for companies where the chief executive held the position for two full years. For executives who were not the C.E.O. for at least two years, change in pay is not calculated and an n/a symbol is used.REVENUE The percentage change in company revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. The figures are not adjusted to reflect spinoffs or restatements. For most financial institutions, only interest income is taken into account.NET INCOME The percentage change in the company’s net income from continuing operations, before accounting changes and extraordinary items, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 The figures are not adjusted to reflect spinoffs or restatements. The symbol -/+ designates companies that reported a loss in 2009 and showed a profit in 2010. The symbol +/- indicates companies that posted a profit in 2009 but reported a loss in 2010. A company with losses in both years is designated as -/-.TOTAL RETURN The percentage change in shareholder value from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2010, assuming that dividends were reinvested.STOCK OPTION GAINS The pretax gain received during fiscal 2010 by exercising vested options granted in previous years. This gain is the difference between the stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option. It does not take into account whether the executive sold the shares that were gained when the option was exercised.STOCK AWARD GAINS The pretax gain received during fiscal 2010 from the vesting of previously granted stock awards. It does not take into account whether the executive sold the shares that were gained upon vesting.TOTAL VALUE OF EQUITY HOLDINGS The value of shares owned plus the value of previously awarded options that have not yet been exercised. Both values are based on the stock price at the end of the company’s fiscal year.LUMP-SUM PENSION The present value, at the end of the fiscal year, of an executive’s accumulated pension benefits.DEFERRED COMPENSATION BALANCE The aggregate value at the end of the fiscal year of the amount in an executive’s deferred compensation plans. In cases where deferred compensation is invested in company stock, amounts listed here may also be included in the total value of equity holdings.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','Lake Bell, 32, the actress known for roles in “How to Make It in America,” “Boston Legal” and “Childrens Hospital,” is at work directing her first feature film, “In a World,” which she also wrote. A native Upper East Sider, the actress this month introduces the Lake satchel, a design collaboration with Botkier, proceeds from which will benefit Oxfam.Spent most of the morning trying to figure out how to look chic in a hailstorm. I resorted to mismatched sweats and ratty but still-wearable-albeit-irrelevant Ugg boots. But wait, it gets sexier. Headed to work in my oversize Army jacket by Comptoir des Cotonniers, which sounds fancy, but I got it secondhand at Tokio 7 in the East Village, and if styled properly makes me look like a pregnant tent.Just because it’s April Fool’s Day does not mean everything’s funny. It rained again, and I’m not laughing. Despite my bad attitude and my pit bull Margaret’s general discontent, I did manage to lighten the mood with my Decades Denim washed black Angelique jean leggings, a bisque-colored Joie silk shell (a savvy Loehmann’s acquisition), a TSE cashmere cardigan, a reprise of the Comptoir Army jacket, and my navy VPL motorcycle boots. Achieved in this outfit: an audition for a big, fancy movie I’ll never get, a meeting with a fashion house to pick my dress for Monday and a vegan dinner with my dad and brother in the East Village. For the end of the night dog walk, I retired to Lucky Brand sweats and burgundy New Balances only to be hit on by Austrian tourists who invited me and the rain-soggy Comptoir to a “nightclub.”Mustard yellow tights. You heard me. I was feeling dangerous and alive; it seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I accompanied these with a black wool A-line Jussara Lee tunic that, hyperbole aside, I’ve had since I was 15; a black cashmere Lyn Devon capelet over a dark heather gray Marni overcoat; coffee brown flat Repetto ankle boots; and a burgundy Hermès Evelyne messenger bag, a gift from my mother. So, really, I was gunning for a look that might get me stopped by a Danish fashion blogger. That did not happen.For some reason, Sundays feel inherently collegiate to me, and therefore require classic or, dare I say, “preppy” vêtements. Nothing achieves that better than Levi’s. I opt for my 524s coupled with a T-shirt that I revere and love: a cream and yellow striped Shipley and Halmos cotton T-shirt that represents the one and only time I have caved in and paid more than $100 for a T-shirt. To cover this vision of cotton is a sin, but alas, the weather is acting like an insolent child, so layer I must. I chose a navy oversize button-down Les Copains sweater with chunky Charlie Brown stripes, a deep emerald green vintage cross-body mini satchel that I scooped up from the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show last year, and my new favorite outfit-makers: zigzag pony hair and desert boots by 80%20.The clouds shall not be trusted: Unleash the wellies. These particular Army green tweed-covered rain boots are from J. Crew that I nabbed from the set of a show I did ages ago called “Surface.” Thanks, NBC. Because of the finicky weather I had to cobble together an outfit that was compatible for potential downpour or sudden spring sunshine. This meant a gray vintage pouf-sleeved sweater over a Rebecca Taylor cowl-neck knit tunic, olive green Hue opaque tights and, the cashmere cherry on top, a slate pompom hat from Tory Burch that I wore religiously at Sundance this year. (By the way, pompom hats make you look 10 years younger. Why get Restylane when you can just wear a pompom hat?)I had a bunch of writing to do, so wanted to be sure to wear something that would allow me to hunch over and aggressively tense my shoulders for five hours. I chose brown Bishop of Seventh slacks, a pale gray Moth cropped cardigan, Philosophy multicolor canvas tie shoes, and a Carven chartreuse mohair oversize vest. Two coffees and three iced green teas later, I realized I may have had a minor heart attack.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','A critical and commercial disaster when it was released in 1970, John Huston’s chilly spy thriller “The Kremlin Letter” has since acquired the kind of cult reputation that seems to attach itself sooner or later to many works of unusual hardness and cruelty. The film, which stars Patrick O’Neal as a novice American operative caught up in a battle between master spies in Soviet Russia, has become the first release of a new company, Twilight Time, that will be issuing limited editions of frequently requested titles from 20th Century Fox, through Amazon and the company’s Web site, screenarchives.com.Based on a novel by Noel Behn, “The Kremlin Letter” was one of several revisionist spy movies of the late ’60s and early ’70s that used the genre to deplore the decline of the heroic idealism of World War II into the squalid cynicism of the cold war. Huston tellingly appears as a senior naval officer who chews out O’Neal’s operative for resigning his military commission in favor of freelance work, which in this case involves a bafflingly complex attempt to recover an inflammatory anti-Chinese communiqué sent by an American official to a high ranking figure in the Kremlin.As adapted by Huston and his longtime assistant, Gladys Hill, the plot becomes another variation on Huston’s favorite theme, the failed quest. The letter of the title proves as illusory and elusive as the bejeweled statuette in “The Maltese Falcon,” Huston’s first film.The spies, who include Richard Boone, Nigel Green, Dean Jagger and George Sanders on the American side, and Max von Sydow, Orson Welles and Ronald Radd on the Russian, seem mainly concerned with inflicting pain and degradation on one another. Caught in the middle are two women who suffer most of the physical consequences of the film’s ruling metaphor of sadomasochism: Barbara Parkins, as an American safecracker (she can open a combination lock with her toes), and Bibi Andersson, as a German prostitute now married to von Sydow’s conscienceless spymaster. Huston’s easy embrace of cliché and casual approach to storytelling at times brings “The Kremlin Letter” close to the campy incomprehensibility of his 1953 “Beat the Devil,” but this time the joke is short-circuited by an insistently nasty, judgmental tone.The Soviets may execute women and children without compunction, but the Americans — more artful in their evil — blackmail a Russian official into cooperating with them by threatening to turn his teenage daughter into a lesbian, a fate the filmmakers clearly regard as something much worse than death. Huston seems transfixed by this and several other instances of what the characters describe as “perverted” behavior — a continuum that ranges from cross-dressing and pot smoking to rape and mutilation. Huston dwells on each juicy detail as he recoils in carefully underlined horror.

"'11-04-10,'0','Giving the McLaren some supercar bona fides is a distinction that the MP4-12C shares only with card-carrying supercars: a chassis made of carbon-fiber composites. Long proven on the Formula One circuit and widely accepted in aerospace roles, the carbon cloth, formed of bundled black strands and used instead of stamped metal panels, imbues the McLaren not only with high strength at low weight but also the allure of the exotic.Still, what really makes the McLaren important to the broader automaking industry is its price: at about half the cost of any previous effort, it is the cheapest car yet with a carbon chassis.Indeed, the advances McLaren has made toward democratizing carbon fiber could well trickle down into the family sedans of the future.As a structural material, it is carbon fiber’s tortuous production process that has sequestered it in the vehicular stratosphere. Yet its potential to revolutionize passenger cars both for safety (it is incredibly strong) and for fuel efficiency (its strength enables reduced weight) has made it a subject of research at carmakers around the world.McLaren surely has the credentials to make this leap. In 1981 its racing team was the first to use a carbon-fiber monocoque in Formula One. The first road car to use a carbon fiber structure was the three-seat McLaren F1 of 1992, and a decade later the company began a run that produced some 2,150 Mercedes SLR McLarens over a half-dozen years.The advances in carbon-fiber fabrication, improving from the 3,000 hours needed to make the million-dollar F1 road car’s chassis to the 400 hours required for each SLR, were remarkable. But the process needed further streamlining to make possible higher volume production of less expensive cars like the 12C.Such a course of technology development is a handy wink-wink long used by automakers to justify spending millions on racing. Advances like paddle shifters and the dual clutch transmission have migrated to the streets from Ferrari’s Formula One cars and Porsche’s endurance racers, and we are better off for it.McLaren’s racing team, of course, really had no recipient for its innovations, at least until McLaren Automotive was formed and the MP4-12C came along.Formula One teams are forever in search of an edge; that part of McLaren’s tradition figured strongly into the development of a method to produce the 12C’s chassis more efficiently. Racecar structures — the “tub” that encloses the driver, with attachment points front and rear for the suspension and powertrain — are built up from sheets of woven carbon-fiber cloth. The cloth, impregnated with epoxy resin, is laid by hand into a mold and cured in a special oven, called an autoclave, for hours.The process used to make the 12C chassis, which the company calls a MonoCell, has been radically abbreviated. Working with Carbo Tech of Austria, the engineers adapted a technology known as resin transfer molding to speed production. The carbon-fiber cloth is loaded into a mold, where both heat and pressure are applied and an epoxy resin is injected.Claudio Santoni, McLaren’s group manager in charge of the car’s body, said that the finished tub took four hours to make, including curing time in the mold — a vast reduction from the 3,000 hours it took to produce a McLaren F1 chassis in the 1990s. Moreover, the new process makes possible large hollow sections in the chassis (the rocker panels, for example), something that previously required a time-intensive bonding process. The 12C’s tub weighs a mere 165 pounds.Among the traits that have made carbon-fiber materials attractive to consumers is its visual appeal: the handsome weave of a premium fabric, encased in a transparent resin that showcases the fine texture under a smooth, glossy surface. It simply looks expensive in the way a fine silk suit whispers luxury.In the McLaren 12C, where form follows miles behind function, decorative displays of structural carbon are found nowhere (though an interior package of cosmetic carbon trim will be offered). There’s a good reason for this: the carbon cloth chosen by McLaren is a non-crimp fabric made of parallel strands that are stitched together — think of bamboo window shades — rather than woven. Each strand is a bundle of 24,000 filaments.“To make a structural piece cosmetic makes the process slow, makes it expensive,” Mr. Santoni said. That function-first reasoning was the argument used to turn back those at McLaren who prodded him to make an exception and showcase the carbon fabric as some cars in the supercar class do.If the 12C is a waypoint, what are the coming attractions? A cycle time of minutes rather than hours is one goal, Mr. Santoni said, as is a shift from thermoset materials to thermoplastics, which would help to overcome the challenges of recycling carbon fiber.Looking beyond the chassis structure, Mr. Santoni sees plenty of room for expansion — cars’ crash structures and engines are candidates for a high-fiber diet. But highly visible exterior body panels like the roof, hood and fenders, which are aluminum on the 12C, are not as likely to make the transition, Mr. Santoni said, “because they need a Class A surface.”So while McLaren’s new baby may be the end of an era in which supercars are defined by their carbon-fiber skeletons, it is also the beginning of a movement toward mainstream applications.How far downmarket might carbon fiber eventually go? “I keep thinking in 30 years that the VW Golf would be possible,” Mr. Santoni said.'"

"'11-04-10,'0','His taste gravitated toward nonfiction. “My first inclination was always to pick a film if it said it was based on a true story. All too often then I would go and find out that only thing that was true was the name of the main character, and that the rest was fabricated. I hated that. It made me feel like I was part of scheme that made me feel kind of dirty. It didn’t seem like the people who were making the picture were treating me like an adult.”Mr. Ricketts and his crew narrowed their focus to films about American history because, in his words, “there are so many fascinating stories that lent themselves to movies for grown-ups.” Once the decision was made to focus on historical events, the producers began looking at screenplays. “I think they looked at about 300 scripts,” Mr. Ricketts said. “ ‘The Conspirator’ really piqued our interest. It was well researched and well done.”It was also nearly old enough to vote. James Solomon began working on it after leaving film school in 1993, drawn to the relationship between the characters and to a dramatic event that had been dwarfed by the enormity of the assassination. “Producers liked it,” he said, “but they kept saying, ’What’s it got to do with today?’ I didn’t hear that anymore after 9/11.” Though the screenplay was optioned a couple of times, the stars never aligned. “If you had told me at the beginning that I’d have to wait 18 years for my screenplay to be produced, but that Robert Redford would direct, I’d have taken that deal,” Mr. Solomon said.What drew Mr. Redford to the story were the same things that initially attracted Mr. Solomon: the relationship between Mrs. Surratt and Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), her inexperienced lawyer, and the opportunity to tell a little-known side of a story that everyone already thinks he knows. “Besides,” Mr. Redford, the founder of the Sundance Institute and film festival, said with a laugh, “after being a champion of independent films for all these years, it was time for me to put my money where my mouth was and direct one myself.”Mr. Redford was also impressed by Mr. Ricketts. “He’s a big, strong guy from Omaha, straightforward, like a fullback,” Mr. Redford said. “Nothing fancy, very solid, but a great supporter of the film. He only came to the set once, made no presumptions, didn’t interfere. He told me he trusted us to make the film. The only thing was, when we discussed me taking the job, he said: ‘O.K., great, but you have to let me know by this afternoon. I want to leave here knowing whether or not you’re on board.’ He was all business.”“The Conspirator” was shot in Savannah, Ga., and much effort was expended on getting the period details just so: The set designer stained wallpaper with tobacco to make it look sufficiently aged. The costumer sandpapered Mary Surratt’s dress in later scenes to simulate the appropriate wear and tear. The production designer researched municipal records to establish the correct street number for the Surratt boardinghouse.All this effort, in Mr. Ricketts’s opinion, establishes the company’s brand. “When I was a child and saw the Disney logo,” Mr. Ricketts said, “I knew that movie was made for me. I want people to see our logo and to know that they’re going to see a story that is good theater, thought provoking, fascinating, and authentic.”He was not oblivious to the risks involved, especially as the big studios have shied away from tackling adult dramas with mid-sized budgets. “People who work for large companies are always reluctant to take the chance of being wrong,” he said. “They see hoop skirts, and they think the movie won’t appeal to a young demographic or to audiences overseas, and they say no. Or they see a story that doesn’t have an orderly three-act structure with a nice beginning, middle and end, as many historical stories do not, and they say no. Or they say it’s downbeat or disturbing, and therefore audiences won’t like it, so couldn’t we change the end? The stories are great, but what you need is somebody willing to say, ‘I’ll put up the money.’ “Of course Hollywood has long been known as a transfer point where people who have made a fortune in one business can be disencumbered of their wealth. But Mr. Ricketts does not plan to treat this investment any differently than his other moneymaking efforts.“I told the fellows when we got started, if we don’t make a profit on the first one, there won’t be a second,” he said. “But I’m so pleased with the outcome of the first that I’m quite sure I will get my money back. I’m so comfortable that we’re looking for a director for the second one,” a film based on the David Hackett Fischer book “Paul Revere’s Ride.” “That one is going to be more of a swashbuckler,” Mr. Ricketts said.'"
"'11-04-10,'0','JOHN STREET, a narrow sliver that runs just eight blocks from Broadway to the South Street Seaport, has been the site of a large number of the office-to-residential conversions in the financial district. Now, one of its last remaining office towers has been tapped to become a rental building.The circa-1930 high-rise at 116 John Street, at the corner of Pearl Street, will become 418 new rental apartments that are expected to start leasing next year. Metro Loft Management, which acquired the building through a joint venture with the current owner, Hacienda Intercontinental Realty, will renovate the building in phases.About 40 percent of the 350,000-square-foot 35-story building still has office tenants, although the developer is hoping that most of them will leave over the next six months. Some of the occupants have leases that do not expire until 2017, “but with minor incentives from us,” said Nathan Berman, a principal at Metro Loft, “most tenants are finding that now is an opportune time to seek out new office space, since the market is still soft and they can get a good deal and enter into long-term leases.” For those tenants who do not vacate, the developer will renovate around them.Avinash K. Malhotra Architects, which was behind the nearby rental project at 2 Gold Street, will oversee the roughly $100 million renovation, which will be evenly divided among studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, with a handful of three-bedrooms mixed in. Amenities will include full-time doormen, a concierge, a rooftop recreation area, a lounge and two gyms.The pricing will be in line with that of other luxury rentals in the area. Jeremiah LoRusso, a managing director of New York Living Solutions, a residential brokerage that has an office at 90 John Street, says monthly rents in the area average $2,000 for a studio; $2,575 for a one-bedroom; $3,600 for a two-bedroom and upwards of $5,500 for a three-bedroom.Along John Street, once known as Insurance Row, many of the older office buildings have been converted to rentals and condominiums over the last 15 years.'"

Mr. Blankfein talks about himself humorously and well. But the book digs up minutiae like Mr. Blankfein’s ability to sing sitcom theme songs from the 1970s and a rabbi’s comment that Mr. Blankfein “was brilliant as a 12-year-old boy.”Despite this level of detail, “Money and Power” remains relatively impersonal about the people it profiles, even when Mr. Cohan has interviewed the participants in bitter he said/he said Goldman Sachs disputes. (Jon Corzine versus Henry Paulson is the book’s most heated bout.) Its many thumbnail biographies tend to concentrate on educational background and favorite sports.Interviewees range from Mr. Paulson, who is said to have a “heavily book-filled” office, to Robert Freeman, who speaks angrily about the insider trading scandal in which he was embroiled and vehemently accuses the writer James B. Stewart of unfair reporting in The Wall Street Journal. (“I think he’s absolutely dishonest,” Mr. Freeman says.) But this book does its hardest hitting when the interviewees are allowed to remain anonymous. Their candor is conspicuously different from the schmoozy yet careful information provided by those with clear Goldman Sachs connections.About Goldman Sachs’s present-day business practices, one “private equity investor” says this: “They view information gathered from their client businesses as free for them to trade on ... it’s as simple as that. If they are in a client situation, working on a deal, and they’re learning everything there is to know about that business, they take all that information, pass it up through their organization, and use that information to trade against the client, against other clients, et cetera, et cetera.” The speaker stops short of labeling this as insider trading, but only barely, saying, “I don’t understand how that’s legal.”Mr. Cohan raises the same question as he writes that the firm’s onetime dedication to its clients has evolved into something more ruthlessly self-serving. “Its primary source of profit has shifted from banking to trading,” he writes, “and the firm is intentionally quite vague about how, and precisely where, those trades are made or, equally relevant, from whom the profits are coming.” When “Money and Power” can boil down its arguments that clearly, it has welcome moments of toughness and precision.But the explication of intricate financial and legal issues is an art form not easily mastered. Mr. Cohan has done a better job of reporting and gathering information than he has of relaying it to the reader. Over the span of 600 pages, “Money and Power” includes an exhausting load of reasonable but clumsy observations like this, about the refinancing of mortgages by homeowners when interest rates fell in 1985 and 1986:“This caused Goldman’s portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, which contained mortgages with higher interest rates, to be paid off early (through refinancings) and to lose value rather than increase in value as would be expected when interest rates fell, since the value of a bond with a higher interest rate increases when relative interest rates fall.”There’s a better way to say this. And there is a better raison d’être for a new Goldman Sachs book than this one provides. Here are three central questions: “Why is Goldman Sachs so very powerful on so many dimensions? How did the firm achieve its present leadership and acknowledged excellence? Will Goldman Sachs continue to excel?”Those were asked in 2008, by Mr. Ellis. Their meaning has changed startlingly over the last three years. Somewhere within “Money and Power” there should be new answers.'"

The agency losing the account is Euro RSCG Worldwide, New York, part of the Havas Worldwide unit of Havas, which had handled those brands since 2009; spending was estimated at $60 million. Euro RSCG will continue as the creative agency in the United States for an allied brand, Dos Equis. The New York offices of two agencies that work for Heineken in other markets will compete for the Heineken USA account; they are Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, and Wieden & Kennedy. Some Heineken commercials created by the Amsterdam office of Wieden & Kennedy, carrying the theme “Open your world,” have been running on American television.¶Steve Shannon joined Hyundai Motor America, Fountain Valley, Calif., as vice president for marketing, succeeding Chris Perry, who left to join General Motors, Detroit, as vice president for marketing at the Chevrolet division. Mr. Shannon had most recently been executive director for marketing at the Cadillac division of General Motors. Hyundai is part of the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea.¶Chris Capossela, senior vice president for the Office division at the Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., was named senior vice president for consumer channels and the central marketing group. The consumer-channels assignment is new; at the marketing group, Mr. Capossela will succeed Mich Mathews, who said she would leave in the summer.¶Jay Bertram, president of TBWA Canada, Toronto, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, will also serve as president of TBWA Latin America, succeeding Gerard Govaerts, who is leaving.¶ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, revised downward its estimate for growth this year in worldwide advertising spending, citing the effects of the natural disasters in Japan and the turmoil in the Middle East. Instead of an increase of 4.6 percent compared with 2010, according to a report to be released on Monday, the increase will be 4.2 percent. But “the underlying recovery remains healthy,” the report declares, and the estimate for growth in worldwide ad spending in 2012 is being raised to a gain of 5.8 percent compared with 2011; the previous forecast was for a gain of 5.2 percent. Looking further ahead, the report predicted that the Internet would supplant newspapers as the second-largest ad medium, behind television, in 2013.¶Strategy Farm, New York, was acquired by Euro RSCG Worldwide, New York, part of the Havas Worldwide unit of Havas.

"'11-04-11,'1','What have they done with ? What happened to the inspirational figure his supporters thought they elected? Who is this bland, timid guy who doesn’t seem to stand for anything in particular?I realize that with hostile Republicans controlling the House, there’s not much Mr. Obama can get done in the way of concrete policy. Arguably, all he has left is the bully pulpit. But he isn’t even using that — or, rather, he’s using it to reinforce his enemies’ narrative.His remarks after last week’s budget deal were a case in point.Maybe that terrible deal, in which Republicans ended up getting more than their opening bid, was the best he could achieve — although it looks from here as if the president’s idea of how to bargain is to start by negotiating with himself, making pre-emptive concessions, then pursue a second round of negotiation with the , leading to further concessions.And bear in mind that this was just the first of several chances for Republicans to hold the budget hostage and threaten a government shutdown; by in so completely on the first round, Mr. Obama set a baseline for even bigger concessions over the next few months.But let’s give the president the benefit of the doubt, and suppose that $38 billion in spending cuts — and a much larger cut relative to his own budget proposals — was the best deal available. Even so, did Mr. Obama have to celebrate his defeat? Did he have to praise Congress for enacting “the largest annual spending cut in our history,” as if shortsighted budget cuts in the face of high unemployment — cuts that will slow growth and increase unemployment — are actually a good idea?Among other things, the latest budget deal more than wipes out any positive economic effects of the big prize Mr. Obama supposedly won from last December’s deal, a temporary extension of his 2009 cuts for working Americans. And the price of that deal, let’s remember, was a two-year extension of the , at an immediate cost of $363 billion, and a potential cost that’s much larger — because it’s now looking increasingly likely that those irresponsible tax cuts will be made permanent.'"
"'11-04-11,'1','Monica Inzer, the dean of admission at Hamilton College in upstate New York, called the practice “borderline unethical,” saying it had the effect of recruiting students from other colleges. “We would allow a student to defer for a year, but never to matriculate full time at another college,” Ms. Inzer said.No one tracks how many colleges use this admissions option, and some are reluctant to reveal that they do. In , they include , Medaille College in and several campuses in the system, including the ones in and Geneseo. Many others around the country, like the and Middlebury College in , have long had variations on the practice, accepting students if they agree to start a semester later.Though deferred admission is not entirely new, admissions officers say the number of colleges offering it has increased in recent years, and they expect that to continue as baby boomers’ children, who created their own demographic bulge, move into adulthood.“Throughout the Northeast in particular, the number of traditional freshmen will continue to go down, so schools that aren’t already doing something like this are talking about it,” said Gregroy P. Florczak, vice president for enrollment management and undergraduate admissions at Medaille. “You’re going to need to pick up in transfers what you are losing in incoming freshmen.”Some admissions officers suggested in interviews that deferred admission had also provided an edge in college rankings. Because the rankings are based in part on the SAT scores and high school grade-point averages of freshmen entering in the fall, the scores — presumably lower — of students who are to begin later are not included. Deferring the admission of some students also lowers the college’s admissions rate, making it appear more selective.William Caren, associate vice president for enrollment services at SUNY Geneseo, said the effect on rankings was not a motivation for his campus’s offering deferred admission, but “a collateral benefit.”Each college with deferred admissions does them a little differently. Usually, the offers are put in writing, and prospective students are asked to submit a form demonstrating interest. But while the college promises delayed admission, students are typically not required to commit themselves or pay a deposit. Colleges often provide academic advisers to help students choose compatible courses at the institution they will attend first.Such arrangements are different from the traditional “articulation agreements” that four-year public colleges make with . In those, the institutions work together to ensure the smooth transferring of credits.When Evi Nam applied to Cornell two years ago after graduating from high school in Concord, N.H., the first word she got from the university’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations was a rejection. “I was heartbroken,” she said.A few days later, she received another message from the school: the offer of a spot the next fall as a transfer student, as long as she earned at least a 3.3 grade-point average at another accredited institution.“It felt like a gift from heaven,” said Ms. Nam, who attended for a year, earned a 3.8, and started at Cornell last fall. “It’s an . I was singing when they gave me the option.”But life was not easy at N.Y.U., where, as fate would have it, she also missed the cut for standard admission. Instead, she was admitted to the university’s Liberal Studies Program, a two-year track for slightly weaker applicants, who are guaranteed enrollment in a bachelor’s program their third year.Ms. Nam held off notifying N.Y.U. about her intention to leave until the end of her year there — and held herself aloof from campus life.“I knew that I was going to be leaving in a year, so I didn’t want to make any BFF’s,” she said. “It put me in an awkward position. I had no connections with N.Y.U. — it was just a steppingstone for Cornell. A lot of people at N.Y.U. got jealous and cut me out of their lives. It was messy.”The dean of the Liberal Studies Program at N.Y.U., Fred Schwarzbach, was critical of students who enter knowing their stay will be temporary. Without commenting specifically on Ms. Nam, he said, “In general, we would not admit a student unless that student were committed to a four-year undergraduate experience.”Still, the benefits of deferred admission can be attractive for both students and colleges.For years, SUNY Geneseo was on the receiving end of the phenomenon, losing sophomores to Cornell year after year. “A lot of students who apply here also apply to Cornell,” Mr. Caren said. “When Cornell says it will defer their admission, they enroll here for a year. Then they come to the dean’s office and say, ‘Well, I’m leaving.’ We picked up on this, and we decided to do it ourselves.”Two years ago, Geneseo, the most selective liberal arts college in the state system, began offering students a guaranteed-transfer admission for the following fall. Those students must receive a 3.0 grade-point average from any accredited institution. Geneseo sent out 200 such offers, but only about 15 students accepted.A more popular program delays admission until the spring semester for hundreds of applicants who are academically stronger than the first group. Mr. Caren said Geneseo last year offered 500 students the option of arriving in the spring, or the following fall; 178 ended up enrolling, up from 50 seven years ago. Though not required to study elsewhere, virtually all do, and more than a third enroll in a four-year college for a single semester.“We have a number of students who graduate midyear for a variety of reasons,” Mr. Caren said. “So the spring semester balances out very nicely and we can maintain the residence halls at fuller capacity.”There are many other variations on the theme of finding room in the future for marginal candidates. Middlebury College asks applicants to indicate their willingness to arrive in February instead of September; about 100 students enroll in the spring, most voluntarily. The University of Maryland has offered 4,400 applicants admission for spring 2012 on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.Fairleigh Dickinson, in Teaneck and Madison, N.J., promises eventual admission to a few hundred applicants each year if they perform well at one of 16 community colleges in the state.And next fall, , one of SUNY’s four research universities, will begin a program that puts another spin on the community college route. It has just offered about 600 applicants spots in its freshman dormitories. But those students will enroll at Broome Community College a few miles away, becoming eligible for admission to Binghamton in a year or two.Asked if housing a subset of community college students on campus could make them feel second-class, Sandra Starke, vice provost for enrollment management at Binghamton, said: “We’re hoping that’s not the case. We believe all students will be inspiring one another to do better.”'"
"'11-04-11,'1','In an e-mail statement, Mrs. Obama said she welcomed General McChrystal’s return to public life because it would allow him to “continue to serve our country through this critical effort to support our nation’s military families.”“He will be a unique and powerful advocate for the millions of Americans who serve our country selflessly,” Mrs. Obama said. “This program will build upon our nation’s great patriotism by asking all Americans to take action and ensure our military families have the support they have earned.”General McChrystal, in a telephone interview on Sunday, noted that a decade of combat carried out by a relatively small military force “has required a lot of sacrifice by families.”“This program will be a chance to focus people’s attention on ways they can help, and on the importance of helping, and provide opportunities for people to find practical things to do to support military families,” he said.After the publication of the controversial profile, which appeared in Rolling Stone in June 2010, General McChrystal accepted responsibility for the comments made by his subordinates and resigned.Since leaving the military, he has been teaching at Yale University and making the rounds on the lecture circuit. He said Sunday that the Obama administration’s invitation to return to public service should be seen as proof to those in uniform, and to the American public, that there were no hard feelings on either side of the civilian-military divide.“We can prove it’s about something bigger,” he said. “It sends a strong, positive message that this is about taking care of our people.”The Joining Forces program will be guided and coordinated by the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan policy institute. The center, which is led by two military veterans, has published a series of reports analyzing stress on service members an part of its study of “military wellness.”Joining General McChrystal on the board of advisers will be Patricia Shinseki, the wife of Gen. Eric K. Shinseki.During the last year of his tenure as the Army chief of staff, General Shinseki was criticized and then ostracized by senior Bush administration officials for his public assessment that a larger military force was needed to bring stability to post-invasion Iraq — comments that proved accurate. After President Obama’s election, General Shinseki was invited out of retirement to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.The new initiative is designed to prod businesses and community and charitable groups to connect with military families as an act of public service, without being prompted to do so by federal money or tax incentives, officials said. Companies will be urged to take extra measures to help military family members find jobs when they move from one community to another, and schools will be urged to adopt programs to help children adjust to the pressure of having a parent in combat.In addition, entertainment and media companies will be asked to produce programs and public awareness spots that spotlight the needs of active-duty families, reservists and veterans. And medical groups will be encouraged to adopt programs that are suited to the health care needs of military personnel, veterans and their families.'"
"'11-04-11,'1','It is clear, however, that Uncle Mo’s immediate future remains fluid. Will he really show up on the first Saturday in May? His camp has left plenty of wiggle room.“Uncle Mo is physically sound today,” Pletcher said. “He walked the shed row this morning. He did grab his quarter at the start of the race, but it is very minor and insignificant. We plan on pulling blood work on Tuesday after giving him a couple of days after the race, which is our standard when we have a horse that doesn’t perform to our expectations.”Even before Uncle Mo spun his wheels, the Derby picture was muddled. Last Thursday, Premier Pegasus, perhaps the best colt in the West, was scratched from the Santa Anita Derby and declared out of the Triple Crown with a hairline fracture of his left front cannon bone.The next day, another promising West Coast contender, Jaycito, trained by the Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, was scratched from the Santa Anita Derby because of a foot abscess. Back East, To Honor and Serve, who was third in the Florida Derby, was sidelined with a strained suspensory ligament.But Uncle Mo’s poorperformance was a confounding development in the buildup to a Kentucky Derby.“It was a puzzler,” Baffert said via e-mail. “He didn’t put up much of a fight, so maybe he was short. Probably move way up if he was. Todd is a great trainer. He will figure him out.”Now, the white-hot lights shift to Baffert, who, with three Derby victories, can not only handle the pressure but also enjoys it. He won the Santa Anita Derby on Saturday with Midnight Interlude, a colt that stepped up to win a $1 million Grade I race after breaking his maiden last month.But even better than him or Jaycito, Baffert has a colt named The Factor looking for his fourth victory this Saturday in the Arkansas Derby. “Very fast horse,” Baffert said. “He has to pass the test.”The test is carrying his speed a mile and an eighth in Arkansas. Like Uncle Mo, The Factor — a son of War Front — has a pedigree ideal for running a fast mile.Neither Pletcher nor Repole want to believe that Uncle Mo cannot outrun his pedigree; he is a son of the distance-challenged Indian Charlie. They also do not want to believe that their 2-year-old champion, a horse they thought was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, has not developed into a better 3-year-old.It is hard to blame them. It happens, however, much the way some teenagers grow faster and dominate for a while until their peers catch up.“With 27 days to the Derby, I have total faith in Todd and total confidence in Uncle Mo,” Repole said.He acknowledged, however, that he was at a loss to explain what happened and was eager to have Uncle Mo’s blood work examined. Pletcher, too, has been turned upside down. He has always chosen his words carefully and kept a lid on the enthusiasm he has for his horses. But he has been crowing about Uncle Mo.Asked about the 3-year-olds and the Derby picture, Pletcher put words to what many were thinking.“I went into yesterday thinking Uncle Mo was a standout,” he said. “Today, it is a very wide-open crop.”'"
"'11-04-11,'1','The difficulty for Intel, say analysts, has been to get its chips’ power consumption down to a level reasonable for a phone. Still, Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, vowed recently that Intel-powered smartphones would be on the market before the year is out. With those phones, Intel hopes to rebuild credibility in a business some customers had thought it would never get right.But meanwhile, the company has just recently lost its mobile champion, Anand Chandrasekher, the 24-year Intel stalwart who has long headed up the company’s mobile processor development, including the wildly successful Centrino product that made Wi-Fi a household name.While industry analysts were divided on whether Mr. Chandrasekher had resigned or had been pushed out, they were in agreement on one thing: The company has a lot of catching up to do in the mobile market. “It’s clear that Intel’s mobile business is not going as well has they had hoped,” said Linley Gwennap, an industry analyst and head of the Linley Group in Mountain View, Calif. “But this is not an indication of a change of strategy, just of leadership.”Intel executives quickly assured the industry that the company remained committed to smartphones, despite the sudden departure of Mr. Chandrasekher.Competitors say they will be ready for Intel when it arrives. “I always assume they’ll show up,” said Michael Rayfield, general manager of Nvidia’s mobile group. “All I can do is innovate rapidly to stay ahead.”Intel’s competitors are also hoping that a recent decision by Nokia, the largest phone maker, to use Windows Phone 7 rather than the Symbian operating system, will help them fend off Intel, given that the Microsoft program is currently optimized for ARM-based cellphones. “Nokia used to be a nonopportunity for us,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. “Our market opportunity just got 33 percent bigger.”Qualcomm has the same idea. Anything that expands the “Microsoft phone ecosystem,” said Steven M. Mollenkopf, executive vice president and group president at Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is a “positive thing for Qualcomm.”In contrast to the PC market, in which Intel and Advanced Micro Devices slugged it out through the 1980s and 1990s, the list of companies supplying chips for smartphones is long. Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Samsung lead the market with a combined market share of 87 percent — with the biggest share of that belonging to Qualcomm. Nvidia, Broadcom, Samsung, Marvell and others are vying for the remainder, according to the market researcher Strategy Analytics.While most PCs have long run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on an Intel chip, the smartphone business is increasingly mix-and-match when it comes to chips and operating systems. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip, for example, powers Google’s Nexus One phone, which runs Google’s Android operating system. The LG Optimus 7 has a Qualcomm chip but runs Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7.Likewise, Samsung’s Focus uses the Qualcomm chip and Windows, while Dell’s Streak, a tablet, uses a Qualcomm chip and runs Android. Motorola chose a Texas Instrument chip for its Droid smartphone and the Tegra 2 for its Atrix smartphone, yet both run Android.The Apple iPhone 4 uses a chip, called the A4, which was designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung. That phone’s operating system, and that of the iPad, is Apple’s own.But given how fast the mobile market is growing, the market landscape could change at any time. “Over the next year or so, there’s going to be a lot of innovation in the industry,” said Mr. Mollenkopf. “It’s not clear who is going to be the winners of that.”The stakes are enormous. In 2010, smartphone shipments increased 74 percent over the prior year, according to the market researcher IDC. In contrast, the PC market grew only 14 percent. That means a lot of chips. IDC forecasts cellphone makers will sell 330 million devices in 2011. Strong smartphone sales drove revenue in the communications chip sector to $80 billion in 2010.Qualcomm’s advantage may lie in its ability to integrate an application processor with communications and graphics functions, and in its long history in the communications chip market. “In the long term, the industry favors those who have significant volume,” Mr. Mollenkopf said.Nvidia, a maker of graphics chips, entered the ARM-based smartphone market in January and has already scored numerous commitments from handset makers. Motorola chose Nvidia’s Tegra 2 for its Atrix smartphone, which when docked with a laptop serves as the laptop’s processor. Motorola also chose the Tegra 2 for its Xoom tablet. Samsung is using the Nvidia chip for its Galaxy phone.Nvidia executives say the company’s experience and reputation in the graphics chip market have made its move into mobile computing a smooth one.“The shift to these devices turning into computers is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us,” Mr. Rayfield said. “They’re moving to a space where Nvidia has grown up.”'"
"'11-04-11,'1','It was no wonder that some people thought Mr. McCracken had designed the monolith featured in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” He did not do it, although he sometimes said that his work might have influenced whoever did.Mr. McCracken’s signature work was a lustrous, intensely colored monochrome plank that leaned simply and provocatively against the wall. It was inspired in part by the West Coast’s car culture — he once described cars as “mobile color chips.”In interviews he usually cited his greatest influences as the color fields of the Abstract Expressionist Barnett Newman and Minimalists like Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Carl Andre. Mr. McCracken hit on the plank idea in 1966, in a period when artists across the stylistic spectrum and on both coasts were combining aspects of painting and sculpture in their work and many were experimenting with sleek, impersonal surfaces.Roughly the size of a plank of lumber, the leaning pieces were so casual as to seem like jokes, except that their intense hues and flawless surfaces projected dignity and beauty; they often seemed to be made of solid color, but also had a totemic presence. Mr. McCracken saw the leaning pieces as existing “between worlds,” not only linking floor (the realm of sculpture) and wall (painting), but also matter and spirit, and body and mind.John Harvey McCracken was born on Dec. 9, 1934, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of an engineer, inventor and cattle-rancher. He grew up in Northern California.After graduating from high school, he served in the Navy for four years before enrolling in the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, earning a B.F.A. in 1962 and completing most of the work for an M.F.A.Like many artists of his generation, Mr. McCracken began as a painter, working in a gestural Abstract Expressionist manner and moving toward a more simplified style, inspired by painters like Stuart Davis and Fernand Léger. By the early 1960s, he developed a genre of abstract Pop centered on geometric emblems and signs that he started fashioning into painted reliefs.Mr. McCracken had his first exhibition at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles in 1965 and his first in New York at the Robert Elkon Gallery in 1966, and was included in every important exhibition of Minimalist sculpture in both the United States and Europe, starting with “Primary Structures” at the Jewish Museum in 1966.Although he remained best known for his colored leaning planks, he also made sculptures in the shape of pyramids, ziggurats, tetrahedrons and occasionally crystals. He worked in highly polished stainless steel and bronze and occasionally made work that in effect sliced the planks into thin, repeating elements that leaned against the wall in rows.And he sometimes returned to painting, making glossy surfaces strewn with small colored shapes as well as small paintings based on Buddhist and Hindu mandalas that he described as “maximalist.” Those works, made in the early 1970s, were not exhibited until much later. They made an especially strong impression in “Documenta 12” in Kassel, Germany, in 2007, in which a small survey of his art, woven throughout the larger show, gave his achievement a sense of continually unfolding mystery and mutlifacetedness.Mr. McCracken’s first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Gail Barringer, of Santa Fe; two sons from his first marriage, David and Patrick, both of Oakland; a stepdaughter, Suzanne Leblanc, of Houston; two sisters, Margaret Eibert of Ridgewood, N.J. and Pamela Rose, of Sacramento, Calif.; and three step-grandchildren.'"
"'11-04-11,'1','In the article Mr. Klein describes Mr. Culhane, who was credited in his work then as James Culhane, as a devotee of the avant-garde. He was influenced by the writings of Russian theorists like Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin, Mr. Klein writes, and spent evenings at the American Contemporary Gallery in Hollywood. There, he watched films by Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir, might have seen paintings by Oskar Fischinger and definitely “was inclined to wear a beret.”In an interview in his office at Loyola’s School of Film and Television, Mr. Klein described Mr. Culhane as having had art training but no college degree; as being a sophisticated reader who painted in his off hours. He said the experimental minifilms “were really a journey of the man” who directed them.Mr. Klein writes that one of those experiments was a two-second piece of an explosion in “Woody Dines Out,” from 1945. He finds the frames “improvised like visual music” in what Mr. Culhane acknowledged in his autobiography, “Talking Animals and Other People,” was an Eisenstein-inspired moment.The longest such experimental sequence was in the seven-second steamroller smash-up in “The Loose Nut,” also from 1945. And, later in that cartoon, Woody is blown into an abstract configuration that Mr. Klein, in his article, calls “the convergence of animation and Soviet montage.”According to the obituary of Mr. Culhane in The New York Times, Mr. Culhane’s family moved to Manhattan from Massachusetts when he was a small child, and later a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art inspired his career as an artist. He first worked with Mr. Lantz when Mr. Lantz got him a job as an office boy at the studio of J. R. Bray, where Mr. Lantz was head of animation. Mr. Culhane animated his first scene there in 1925. It was of a monkey with a hot towel.Throughout the mid-1940s Mr. Culhane made cartoons, briefly at Warner Brothers, then at Mr. Lantz’s studio, where he was a director of some shorts that are remembered for more than their surface humor. In 1944 he collaborated with the layout artist Art Heinemann on “The Greatest Man in Siam.” In it the Fastest Man in Siam bolts past doorways that are distinctly phallic in shape and peers at another that mimics a vagina.“We were just trying to put one over on them,” Mr. Culhane years later told Mr. Klein, who had asked him about the bawdy imagery in the course of a visit and correspondence shortly before Mr. Culhane died.Visual pranks have been common in the animation world, where artists often find ways — occasionally, in frames that pass without actually being seen — to plant jokes on bosses and a largely unsuspecting audience. A favorite trick has been to hide caricatures of real people in crowd scenes, like those in the Walt Disney films “Aladdin” and “The Princess and the Frog,” which contain images of their directors, John Musker and Ron Clements, according to Charles Solomon, an animation critic and historian.“Even I appear in a crowd,” said Mr. Solomon, whose hidden image, he said, is tucked in the “Rhapsody in Blue” sequence of “Fantasia/2000.”It was clues in “Talking Animals and Other People” and in letters Mr. Culhane wrote to Mr. Klein — who had become a Woody Woodpecker expert through his archival work for Universal Studios, which distributed the cartoons — that pointed Mr. Klein toward something more. In one letter Mr. Culhane, talking of his fascination with Russian film theory, said nothing he picked up from his studies ever caused trouble with Mr. Lantz, who was known for giving his directors a free hand.As for much of the contemporary audience, Mr. Klein said, “Maybe they were seeing their first glimpse of modern art.”'"
"'11-04-11,'1','The New York City Opera, struggling to close a $5 million deficit, has postponed its announcement of its next season, which is troubling news for opera buffs and supporters of this essential company.But the audience that packed the David H. Koch Theater on Saturday afternoon for a special Family Opera in Concert event seemed anything but troubled. After all, most of them were children, who had come with parents and adults galore to see the British composer Oliver Knussen’s “Where the Wild Things Are,” adapted from Maurice Sendak’s story, with a libretto by Mr. Sendak.Though billed as a concert, this was really a quasi-production imaginatively staged by the choreographer Seán Curran and starring an appealing young soprano, Danya Katok, as the rambunctious young Max. In his City Opera debut Julian Kuerti, a rising Canadian conductor who was an assistant to James Levine at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, drew a bustling, moody and colorful performance of Mr. Knussen’s 50-minute score from the impressive City Opera Orchestra.This presentation was the highlight of the company’s Opera Is Elementary educational program this season. Earlier in the week 5,000 children from New York City public schools had attended two special performances of “Where the Wild Things Are,” prepped by company members who worked with teachers to introduce students to the basics of music and drama. Also, in partnership with the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, visual artists worked with schoolchildren to help them make their own interpretations of the story. The images that illustrated the opera during the performance, projected on a screen behind the performers, were taken from the drawings and paintings of the youngsters.On Saturday, looking out into the house filled with parents and eager children, George Steel, the City Opera’s general manager and artistic director, said, “You are my favorite kind of audience.” He introduced a 10-minute video that documented the process of preparing the elementary school students for the opera.Mr. Knussen’s inventive adaptation of “Where the Wild Things Are” has had considerable success since he introduced the final version in London in 1984. An important modernist composer, Mr. Knussen did not write down to children in this score. The musical language, while often gritty and thick-textured, abounds in energy, atmosphere, alluring sounds and visceral drama. As the orchestra began the piece, with ominous stirrings in the low strings, rumbling in the percussion and quietly piercing harmonies, a little girl seated near me turned to her father and said, “That sound must mean a lot of things.”Of course Mr. Knussen had a sure-fire subject to work with. Is there any child (or adult) who does not know this story? When we meet the misbehaving Max, dressed in a wolf suit, he is tearing up his room and destroying his toys. His exasperated mother sends him to bed without supper. But he escapes in a dream to a forest, the place of the Wild Things, who, overcoming their initial wariness, crown him king. In the midst of a frenzied dance, Max realizes that he misses home. When he wakes up, his good mother has left him some dinner after all.'"
"'11-04-11,'1','Sitting in her corner office in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, Ms. Ganeless said the celebrations for the 20th anniversary were subdued. “Next year, we’ll be 21, we’ll be legal, maybe we’ll have a party then,” she said. “That’s more in the spirit of Comedy Central.”Besides, the channel is still savoring its last big party, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert’s “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” in Washington last fall. An aerial photo of the hundreds of thousands of attendees hangs above Ms. Ganeless’s desk. Of that day, she said, “I’ve never been prouder.”To date, almost every one of the channel’s successes has been the equivalent of a stand-up act: what Ms. Ganeless calls “singular point-of-view comedy.”“It’s taking a talent like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert or Daniel Tosh or Sarah Silverman, and giving them a platform to do their thing,” she said. The animated show “South Park” is similar, she said, because it comes from two best friends, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. (Comedy Central is a small investor in their Broadway show “The Book of Mormon,” which opened last month.) Even “Onion SportsDome,” the new satiric sports newscast from The Onion, “comes from a very specific point of view,” she said.Comedy Central’s forays into other formats, like sitcoms and reality shows, have mostly failed, with the notable exceptions of “Reno 911!,” a satire of “COPS” that ended in 2009, and “The Sarah Silverman Program,” a scripted take on the comedian’s life, which ended last year. Ms. Ganeless said, “We’ll continue to try to find the right narrative shows for us, and if we find a reality show that’s the right fit, we’ll do that.”Last week, the channel introduced “Workaholics,” a scripted narrative about three twenty-something men who work at a telemarketing company. This week “Sports Show With Norm MacDonald,” begins and Ms. Ganeless likens it to “Weekend Update” for sports, recorded just two days before each air date.Mr. Herzog has his eye on the midnight time slot, which directly follows the one-two current events punch of “The Daily Show” and “The Colbert Report.” But first, he said, “we’d like a couple more keepers in prime time.” Last week, the channel ordered another full season of one such prime-time show, “Futurama,” which had been canceled by Fox in 2003 only to find a new life in reruns on Adult Swim, the nighttime version of Cartoon Network.By far the channel’s most important prime-time show right now is “Tosh.0,” a collection of Internet video clips stitched together by Mr. Tosh, a 35-year-old comedian who attracted as many as 4.7 million viewers to new episodes of his show last winter. To date this year, he is responsible for all 10 of the channel’s top-rated telecasts.A slide in a recent PowerPoint presentation for Viacom executives called “Tosh.0” “the template for future success stories” for two reasons. First, Mr. Tosh is a product of Comedy Central’s development pipeline. He appeared on the channel’s stand-up specials as early as 1999, and last fall its live events division helped to produce his nationwide tour, complete with $3 million in advertising.Second, Mr. Tosh’s audience flocks to his Web site and his Twitter feed between episodes, making “Tosh.0” “our first truly multiplatform show,” said Erik Flannigan, the channel’s head of digital media. Perhaps most important, Mr. Tosh talks back, thanks to Twitter. “The millennials that are our audience now fully expect to be able to interact with talent,” Mr. Flannigan said.For Comedy Central, “Tosh.0” is now the fourth wall of the house, alongside “The Daily Show,” “The Colbert Report” and “South Park.” And that’s critical because both “The Daily Show” and “South Park” were conceived in the 1990s, making them almost as old as some of the channel’s viewers. Mr. Stewart is signed through mid-2013, but Comedy Central executives already dread the day that he decides to step down.“If I were the guy who owned the Chicago Bulls, I’d be dreading the day Michael Jordan decided to retire, too,” Mr. Herzog said.That may be where the development pipeline proves itself again. The pipeline starts with stand-up acts, like the ones that are now being featured on “John Oliver’s New York Stand-Up Show,” a six-episode spotlight on young comedians. From there, the channel sometimes signs talent deals, books half-hour and one-hour specials with comedians, and contemplates possible stand-alone shows.“You can never have enough,” Mr. Herzog said. “You can never be funny enough.”'"

"'11-04-12,'0','Despite the political wrangling in Lisbon, analysts suggested that Portugal could not afford to delay a bailout deal beyond mid-May, the deadline set by European Union finance ministers last week.“Political divisions are likely to keep weighing on the drafting of the program,” Tullia Bucco, an economist at UniCredit, wrote in a research report. “But the involvement of I.M.F. and E.U. officials should help ease potential tensions and forge a consensus on the needed measures.”The bailout talks in Lisbon this week are expected to start with a technical assessment of Portugal’s finances, including the accounts of its banking sector.To add to the uncertainty, the election might not produce a clear-cut outcome. The main opposition Social Democratic Party is expected to win, but without an absolute majority. The most recent opinion poll, released last week and carried out by the Catholic University of Portugal, showed Mr. Sócrates and his Socialist party narrowing the gap — an outcome that raised the possibility of a hung Parliament.“Nobody looking at Portugal’s economic and political prospects should rule out Sócrates at this stage, because he has certainly not lost as much support as one might expect in this crisis and is at his strongest when campaigning,” said Cristina Casalinho, chief economist of BPI, a Portuguese bank.Tough conditions set by international creditors could set off more social unrest and raise protectionist sentiment, playing into the hands of far-left politicians, led by the Communists, who arguably remain more powerful in Portugal than anywhere else in Western Europe.This week, leftist groups started erecting billboards around Lisbon condemning an anticipated demand by creditors for more privatizations, under the slogan that “With the I.M.F., the one who pays is you.”Portugal is following Greece and Ireland in requiring international assistance. The concern in Portugal is that tough bailout terms will leave the country with crippling repayment obligations that the country cannot count on economic growth to help it meet. The monetary fund projects that Portugal will remain in recession until 2012.Political feuding in Lisbon has kept Portugal’s debt yields close to record highs since the rescue request last week. The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds rose one basis point, or one hundredth of a percentage point, to 8.411 percent on Tuesday.Portugal’s woes are being watched in Spain, a much larger euro zone economy that has also been in investors’ firing line because of its budget deficit and troubled banking sector. Spain’s borrowing terms have improved in recent weeks, however, after the central government met its 2010 deficit target. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds fell 5 basis points Tuesday to 5.165 percent.In a further vote of confidence, the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said Tuesday that China would continue buying Spanish bonds, after recently buying about 6 billion euros. His comments followed a meeting in Beijing with Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.Having resisted for months the idea of a bailout, the Portuguese authorities now insist some of the rescue financing must be delivered by June. The Portuguese Treasury had a cash balance of 3.3 billion euros at the end of March, which it subsequently strengthened by selling some additional debt — although at high interest rates — to meet 4.5 billion euros in repayments due Friday.Portugal next faces repayment obligations of about 7 billion euros in June, its toughest refinancing hurdle of the year.'"

"'11-04-12,'0','“When we asked to have a farmers’ market, we were told that farmers don’t want to come to the Bronx because it’s dangerous, or poor people can’t afford organic products,” said Karen Washington of La Familia Verde, a community garden organization active in Crotona, East Tremont and West Farms in the Bronx that started its markets with the help of Just Food, which promotes local and urban agriculture and coordinates 17 markets in the city. “But instead of listening to the naysayers, we figured: since we grow it, we know our community; let’s form our own farmers’ market.”According to the report, the demand is clear: the city’s 60 community markets took in almost $500,000 in government nutrition coupons in 2009 and 2010.But organizers must follow different permitting processes depending on where they seek to operate — in, say, a community garden or a park or on a street corner — and the income level of the area. Fees, which must be paid in advance of the selling season, can exceed $1,600 annually, a level that can strain the resources of a small organization. And even after the permits are obtained, vendors can have parking problems, since their permits are not always recognized by city ticket agents.Mr. Stringer’s report recommends creating a single entity to oversee the markets, a uniform application process, a guide to operations and standard procedures for parking. It also suggests eliminating some fees.Responding to the issues raised by the report, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s office did not acknowledge a problem and had little to say about whether change could be on the way. Asked why the process was so complicated and if the city could do anything to make it easier, a spokeswoman said in an e-mail, “New Yorkers who apply for a street permit to hold a farmers’ market receive a detailed outline of all the necessary steps to make the process as clear as possible.” A follow-up question about those applying for permits for other locations — like parks or community gardens — went unanswered.The executive director of GrowNYC, Marcel Van Ooyen, acknowledged that the system was complex. “It’s just complicated to work through New York City in anything you do; you have multiple agencies” involved in the regulations, he said, adding that his group had routinely tried to help others negotiate the bureaucracy. He said he was considering creating an online tutorial for anyone thinking about starting a market, to provide all the information in one place.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','But economists are still trying to determine the longer-term economic impact.“Once we cross the $4 threshold, the pain will become more palpable, and it is going to show up more noticeably in the reduction in future consumer spending,” said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group. He predicted that “spending on discretionary goods will be diminishing as the price of gasoline keeps moving higher.”He also pointed out that the government’s retail sales figures for March, a broader measure that also takes into account more sectors and categories, will be released on Wednesday. “I would not be at all surprised that non-gasoline purchases are beginning to suffer,” he said.John Gamel, the director of gasoline research for , noted the good jobs report last month. “It has been a tug of war,” he said, between the improved labor market and any drag of higher gas prices.He said that a MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse report showed that gasoline consumption fell 3.6 percent in the week ending April 1, year on year, the fifth consecutive decline.“Even with the better labor market, consumers are cutting back on their driving,” Mr. Gamel said. “That is something we will have to watch.”The decline may also be caused by Americans’ switch to more cars since 2008.“As bad as it is to see $4 pump prices,” the economy is in better shape now than it was three years ago, said James W. Paulsen, the chief strategist for Wells Capital Management.“The recent surge in energy prices may well slow the pace of economic recovery in the next few quarters,” he wrote in a research note on Monday. “However, the different position and tenure of the U.S. job market could be the reason why the contemporary energy crisis may prove more a consumer irritant at the pump than a cycle-ending risk.”Economists are also saying that industries that depend on travel revenue, like recreation and hotel businesses, could feel the pinch over the Memorial Day weekend and during the summer.The rise in gasoline prices began to gain steam after political turmoil surged in the in February. Commodity prices soared amid heightened concerns over supply disruptions, especially from , even though other producers offered to make up for any shortfall. Crude prices climbed to their highest level in more than two years last Thursday, closing higher than $110.“Money has been pouring into all commodities at an incredible pace for the last four months,” said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst with the Oil Price Information Service.“I think we have hit the tipping point,” he said of gasoline prices. “The sweet spot this year for economic growth without damaging demand was probably $3.25 to $3.75.The surge in commodity prices has been so pronounced that officials have commented on gasoline prices. On Monday, in fact, , the vice chairwoman of the board of governors of the Fed, said that rising energy and were creating “significant hardships” for many people and that the Fed was watching the effect on inflation.Economists said they expected that Americans would make fewer nonessential trips by car, particularly over Memorial Day or for summer vacation, or would consolidate more trips for work with errands.“People just don’t have the elasticity in their budgets,” said Robert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman for AAA New York.Still, many Americans are like Jon Wood, a 49-year-old mechanic who, after the run-up in gas prices in 2008, reluctantly bought a for his 80-mile round-trip commute to his job in Greenwich, Conn.Now, with the price for a gallon of gas at $4.19 at the station where he works, he is glad he did.“I drive something very economical,” Mr. Wood said of his car, a 1993 model that gives him 30 miles to the gallon on the highway. “Normally, it would not be my first choice.”'"
"'11-04-12,'0','The Bulls? ESPN pegged them as the fourth-best team in the East. Sports Illustrated had them sixth. Four ESPN writers and six for Sports Illustrated picked Miami or Boston to win the conference. None put Derrick Rose in the most valuable player discussion. The general managers, in an N.B.A.com poll, ignored Chicago too.Next weekend, the Bulls will open the playoffs as the East’s top seed, defying expectations and bringing a little cheer to the masses who cringed over Miami’s star-stacking and preening last summer.They were built without (alleged) superstar conspiracies or sports agency power plays and without a silly rally to celebrate themselves. They are the people’s choice, a populist antidote to the overheated Miami fascination.Chicago’s roster was built organically over a half-decade, not slapped together in a week.Rose, a leading M.V.P. candidate, was drafted with the No. 1 pick in 2008. Two other starters, Joakim Noah (2007) and Luol Deng (2004), were acquired on draft day (Deng via trade). Chicago’s flashiest signing of the last five years was Carlos Boozer, who ranked no better than seventh in the 2010 free-agent market.When the chance came to obtain a marquee name — Denver’s Carmelo Anthony — the Bulls stuck to their principles and refused to trade Noah, a gritty role player whom they deemed more vital. Implicit in the decision: chemistry and roster balance trump talent.Presiding over the Bulls’ rise is a rookie coach, Tom Thibodeau, a workaholic career assistant who had been passed over numerous times before landing in Chicago.Despite their superior record, the Bulls are as understated and steady as their modest star guard. Rose is among the league leaders in scoring (25.1 points per game), assists (7.8) and free throws, but never leads with his ego.“What Derrick showed his first year or two is humility,” John Paxson, the Bulls’ executive vice president, said in an interview with WSCR-AM in Chicago on Monday. “He respected the pecking order of things. He’s not a look-at-me type of guy, full of bravado. He came in and observed the climate, and he has grown into this role.”The Bulls have come this far because of their defensive tenacity and Rose’s leadership and playmaking. Making the next leap will prove tougher.The Celtics, despite their recent struggles, remain the logical favorites to win the East because of their talent, depth, longevity and championship experience. Miami has the best front-line talent in James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, and a defense that on its best nights rivals those of Chicago and Boston.But the Heat and the Celtics are on a collision course to meet in the second round, while the Bulls’ path to the conference finals has much smaller speed bumps: the Indiana Pacers, followed by the Orlando Magic or the Atlanta Hawks.The more daunting obstacle may be history, and an unwritten law of N.B.A. physics: that teams do not, in general, leap from mediocrity to title contention in a single year. The Bulls went 41-41 last season and were bounced in the first round by James’s Cleveland Cavaliers.Tradition holds that the Bulls should win a playoff series or two and endure some spring heartbreak before winning a title (see: late-’80s Pistons, early-’90s Bulls, late-’90s Lakers). But the Bulls are young and sturdy, reasonably priced and with room to grow.As the Celtics age and fade, as the Heat and the Knicks try to replicate Boston’s success compiling stars, the resurgent Bulls provide a welcome counterpoint — an alternate model for a league of anxious general managers.Last fall, Commissioner David Stern brushed aside concerns about superstar consolidation, citing the rejuvenating power of the draft, the influx of high-level foreign talent and the promise of Oklahoma City. “I think your doom scenario is overstated,” Stern said in October.A Bulls championship would do nothing to calm the fears of small-market teams and fans who fear the tyranny of the glamour markets. But it could bring some sanity back to the discussion.'"

"'11-04-12,'0','Two former University of San Diego basketball players and a former assistant were among 10 people indicted as part of a conspiracy to commit sports bribery, federal authorities said Monday. The conspiracy included the operation of an illegal sports bookmaking service and the distribution of marijuana.According to the grand jury’s indictment, which was handed up Friday and unsealed Monday by the United States attorney’s office, the former San Diego star Brandon Johnson “attempted to influence and influenced the outcome of a U.S.D. basketball game for a monetary bribe” in February 2010. Johnson is San Diego’s career leader in scoring and assists.Johnson, who exhausted his eligibility in the spring of 2010, is also accused of soliciting an individual in January to affect the outcome of San Diego games. Johnson, 24, was arrested in his native Houston last weekend.The indictment also charges that Brandon Dowdy, 22, a San Diego player in 2006-7 who transferred to U.C. Riverside, and Thaddeus Brown, 32, an assistant at San Diego in 2006-7, approached a player at Riverside to fix a game this season.The defendants “enriched themselves by operating an illegal sports bookmaking business and distributing marijuana,” a news release from the United States attorney’s office said, and with their proceeds tried to alter the outcome of games, which they would then bet on at Las Vegas casinos.San Diego finished 6-24 this past season, its fourth under Coach Bill Grier.

"'11-04-12,'0','A Wall Street analyst, Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo Securities, said Infuse accounts for the vast majority of Medtronic’s sales of biologic products, which he projected would reach $897 million in the company’s current fiscal year.Mr. Biegelsen said the continuing federal investigation of Infuse, along with the F.D.A.’s rejection of Amplify, could lead to a slowdown of Infuse sales over the next year. He estimated that off-label use by doctors of the bone-growth protein made up 70 to 80 percent of Infuse sales.The extent of the federal criminal inquiry involving Infuse is not clear. But the doctor who was recently contacted by Justice Department officials also said that it was his understanding that prosecutors had contacted other physicians in recent months.One military surgeon testified before a federal grand jury in Boston investigating the Infuse issue about a year ago, said people with knowledge of the inquiry who also requested anonymity because it was continuing.Army officials have also provided the Justice Department with the results of a military investigation into the experimental use of Infuse on dozens of soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, said Col. Norvell V. Coots, commander of the Walter Reed Health Care System. The Army’s 2008 report on that investigation found that a former military doctor, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, had overstated Infuse’s benefit in a medical journal study that examined its use in the treatment of solders whose shin bones had been severely shattered by explosive devices in Iraq.Dr. Kuklo, who became a Medtronic consultant, also forged the signatures of that study’s co-authors in a journal submittal, the Army said. Medtronic later broke its ties to him, and the medical journal that published the article retracted it.Medtronic has previously disclosed both the existence of a federal inquiry into its marketing of Infuse as well as the Justice Department’s interest into research it underwrote at Walter Reed.In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, the company released a statement noting its previous disclosures. It declined to say whether federal officials were examining specific issues like company-sponsored research.“Medtronic does not comment on what precise topics the government may or may not be examining at any point in the investigation,” the company said.Henry J. Dane, who represented Dr. Kuklo in the Walter Reed investigation, said the Justice Department had subpoenaed the doctor’s records. Mr. Dane said he understood that prosecutors had also sought records from academic researchers and doctors outside the military who worked on other studies about Infuse that had been financed by Medtronic.“He’s far from the only one,” to get a subpoena, said Mr. Dane, referring to Dr. Kuklo.Mr. Dane said that a lawyer in Boston, Thomas C. Frongillo, has represented Dr. Kuklo and other physicians contacted by the Justice Department in the Infuse investigation. Reached by telephone, Mr. Frongillo declined comment. Several academic researchers involved in Medtronic-financed studies about Infuse did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment.A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Boston, Christina DiIorio-Sterling, cited Justice Department policy in declining to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Infuse for a certain type of spinal fusion procedure, in which problem spinal vertebrae are joined in an effort to stop severe back pain. Doctors are free to use an approved product in any way they choose, and many surgeons began using Infuse for other types of spinal fusion operations.Some of the doctors who performed research studies into such so-called off-label uses of Infuse received millions of dollars in consulting fees from Medtronic, Congressional investigations have found.In 2008, the F.D.A. issued a warning about the use of bone-growth proteins like Infuse in one off-label fusion procedure used to treat neck pain, citing reports of life-threatening injuries.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','The device, known as “Kindle with Special Offers,” will have the same hardware as the most recent, $139 Kindle, with Wi-Fi, a one-month battery life and an 8.5-ounce body. But instead of the typical Kindle screen savers, like images of authors, Amazon will show ads from brands like Buick, Procter & Gamble and Visa. The ads will also show up on the home screen, but they will not appear inside e-books.Amazon will give users a say in which ads they see, borrowing a page from the playbooks of Hulu and TED.com. People can vote, either online or on a Kindle app called AdMash, for their favorite of two ads, like a close-up of a model’s face versus a photo of a jar of cream for Olay. They can also tell Amazon whether they want to see more or fewer ads with landscapes or illustrations, for instance.Readers will also be able to get discounts through their Kindles. Amazon will open the offers to advertisers, but to start, the deals are all from its site, like $10 for a $20 Amazon.com gift card or 50 percent off a Roku streaming player from Amazon. By entering the daily deal business, Amazon is competing with Groupon and with LivingSocial, the group-buying service in which it is an investor. Mr. Marine said that Amazon’s service was separate from LivingSocial’s.The ads and offers appear to be another significant step toward Amazon building its own tablet and competing more directly with the iPad, said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research who studies digital media and consumer electronics. Amazon opened an Android app store last month and has been hiring Android software developers.An Amazon tablet could tie together the seemingly disparate parts of the company’s business, Mr. McQuivey said, including e-commerce, e-books, video and audio.“I can so easily see them selling a tablet in the future at a dramatically reduced price,” he said. “To me, this is a way for them to test that out and to start talking to advertisers.”When asked whether the new Kindle was a move toward a tablet, Mr. Marine said, “I don’t want to speculate.” He also declined to say when the Kindle would have a color or touch screen, both elements of the Apple iPad and Android tablets made by Motorola, Samsung and others.By incorporating ads in the Kindle operating system — as screen savers and in the menu, where readers will find the list of offers — Amazon is also creating a new kind of ad that could be used for new business models. Publishers, who have been searching for new ways to market e-books to replace intriguing covers and bookstore displays, could give away sponsored e-books. Amazon could also build a group-buying service among Kindle owners.Buick’s Kindle ads will show photographs of four of its cars and text that relates to reading, like a reference to a car owner’s manual, said Craig Bierley, director of advertising and promotions for General Motors’s Buick division. Because reading books is an intimate experience, he said he hoped people might pay more attention to the ads.“The Kindle for many people is really a centerpiece of their entertainment, so their level of engagement with the device, and hopefully with the advertisers on it, will be higher,” Mr. Bierley said.That type of engagement is the holy grail in advertising these days, said Bobby Calder, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. Still, books are one of the last ad-free zones, and by showing ads on an e-reader, Amazon risks alienating some users, he said.“There’s been research that shows that if you put an ad in an environment where people are highly engaged, that kind of intrusiveness can really backfire,” he said.People could buy the less expensive Kindle and then avoid the ads by turning off Wi-Fi. Mr. Marine said Amazon did not think customers would do that because they would value the offers on the new Kindle, which is now available for order and expected to ship May 3.“We think the response is going to be really positive because it doesn’t touch the reading experience,” he said.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','Rumbles, thunderclaps and a baleful reading from the Old Testament prophet Amos — “I will slay the last of them with my sword” — opened the set by Lustmord on Sunday night at the Abrons Arts Center, the finale of the Unsound Festival of electronic and contemporary music and video. It was an extraordinarily rare live performance by the British musician Brian Williams, who has been recording as Lustmord since 1980 but has given only a handful of public concerts during his career, emerging for the Unsound Festival in Krakow, Poland, last year.Lustmord has been a pioneer of what is generally called dark ambient music. It is textural rather than melodic, ultra-slow and submerged in bass and sub-bass frequencies, merging natural reverberations — Lustmord has recorded in crypts — with electronic ones. It opens abysses and lingers in them. When Lustmord got started it was associated with post-punk industrial music. Mr. Williams was a member in the 1980s of the Australian industrial group SPK and more recently has collaborated with the Melvins and Tool. While recording prolifically as Lustmord he has worked extensively as a sound designer in Hollywood, bringing ominous resonances to movie soundtracks.Now that equipment is portable enough to recreate and manipulate the sounds he assembled over the decades in the studio, a concert setting, free of distractions or interruptions and enveloped by the music, is ideal for Lustmord. Behind Mr. Williams and his laptop a screen showed images made by four video artists, changing in slow motion with computerized symmetries: smoke, clouds, flames, morphing three-dimensional white shapes, a circular kabbalah diagram. Subwoofers set the Henry Street auditorium shuddering.The music moved at a tectonic pace, with its elements gradually welling up from subterranean depths. Within the drone and throb were deep Tibetan chants, orchestral strings, wordless choruses, distant howls, sustained synthesizer tones, dissonant buzzes, emerging and disappearing chords, and what might have been icebergs cracking, winds rushing, planes flying overhead and volcanoes erupting.There was a pulse to the music, at first like the respiration of a sleeping leviathan and eventually with an established beat, created at first by a low repeating crash, like a tall tree falling. The music gradually accelerated to what would have been, in most concerts, the slowest dirge; a steady drumbeat surfaced, and eventually a syncopated one, only to disappear within a looming, buzzing drone. The last stretch of the music was marginally more conventional, with rushes of cymbals and hovering, Penderecki-like classical choirs. Another beat emerged, steady and industrial, with jackhammer sounds. But it, too, would be swallowed in rumble and drone, manmade music reverting to primordial sound.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','The architects, Platt Byard Dovell White, would have liked to go further — to make the ground-floor windows even bigger, for example. But they were forced to tread lightly, given the building’s landmark status.“We wanted to do more than what we ended up doing,” said Samuel G. White, one of the architects, “which is probably the basis of any negotiation.”Some preservationists still say the society went too far.“Most of what they did on the exterior was an unnecessary intrusion to the historic fabric,” said Roberta Brandes Gratz, who recently left the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. “The real issue with an institution like this is the quality of their program. I think they’ve compromised the spaces in which to provide that quality at an unnecessary, sizable expense.”Despite the restrictions, the society was able to push the building in new directions. It created a roomier theater for the auditorium, with a new mezzanine, a 73-foot-wide stage and 420 seats, up from 300. (The society is working with the filmmaker Donna Lawrence to develop a 17-minute orientation film for visitors.) There will be a new restaurant at the 77th Street entrance that will be run by Starr Restaurants group (of Buddakan and Morimoto fame), which will be decorated with pieces from the collection. And the new DiMenna Children’s History Museum and the Barbara K. Lipman Children’s History Library on the lower level will feature interactive exhibitions.Perhaps more important, the society is trying to send out a new vibe, one less stodgy and more hip. Thus touch-screen kiosks in the lobby; flat screens inserted in the great hall’s arches that will flash highlights from the collection, like Audubon’s painting of the extinct Carolina parakeet and what is reputedly the only surviving New York printing of the Declaration of Independence; and a ceiling from Keith Haring’s original Pop Shop — donated by the Keith Haring Foundation — that will float over the admissions desk.Ms. Mirrer said the hope was that the Haring would “unlock the imagination, particularly of young people.”“The ’80s is history,” she said, “and we want everyone to understand it doesn’t have to be the deep past to find its way into the New-York Historical Society.”The renovation also allowed the society to rediscover its own surroundings. When the dropped ceiling in the auditorium was removed, for example, the work revealed a Guastavino vaulted ceiling like the one in the Grand Central Terminal Oyster Bar.A dozen display cases will show artifacts found in the ground in New York, like arrowheads from the 16th century and a 17th-century wine bottle found in Pelham Bay Park. “History beneath your feet,” Ms. Mirrer said. The great hall will feature a permanent exhibition on the effects of 9/11, including a door from the first fire engine that reached ground zero and a clock that stopped when the second plane hit.To establish more of a street presence, the society will position life-size bronze sculptures outside the building — Lincoln on Central Park West, Frederick Douglass on West 77th Street. Although people don’t typically think of Lincoln or Douglass as New Yorkers, Ms. Mirrer said, each has a distinctive connection to the city.The well-known Lincoln photograph that makes him look so presidential was taken by Mathew Brady in his Broadway studio, soon after Lincoln’s famous Cooper Union speech, she noted. And Douglass, born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, described his first impressions of New York in his autobiography: “Less than a week after leaving Baltimore, I was walking amid the hurrying throng, and gazing upon the dazzling wonders of Broadway.”There will also be a giant head of Lincoln just inside the 77th Street entrance, part of Daniel Chester French’s study for the Lincoln Memorial. And the walls of the 77th Street rotunda will feature vertical murals by Richard Haas depicting images of Lower Manhattan.“They all resonate with what we hope visitors will understand this institution to be about, which is New York and beyond,” Ms. Mirrer said. “You understand New York as a lens through which you can see the nation.”'"
"'11-04-12,'0','Alcoa, the aluminum producer, reported a first-quarter profit that slightly beat estimates, but its revenue missed Wall Street’s estimates and its shares dropped 3 percent in after-hours trading on Monday.Revenue in the quarter rose 22 percent, to $5.96 billion from $4.89 billion, helped by rising aluminum prices, but it lagged the Wall Street forecast of $6.08 billion.“What’s really going to worry the market is top-line growth,” said Alan Lancz, president of the Alan B. Lancz & Associates investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio. “They’ve really improved margins as much as they can, and if you don’t get the top-line growth now or it doesn’t meet expectations, that leaves the market vulnerable.”Net income for the first quarter was $308 million, or 27 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $201 million, or 20 cents a share in the quarter last year, the company said.Income from continuing operations, which excludes special items, was 28 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates for 27 cents a share.“Our outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond remains very positive due to the world’s growing population” and increasing urbanization, the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in the earnings statement.Shares of Alcoa slipped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. They also declined 15 cents, or 0.84 percent, to $17.77, in regular trading.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','The findings are certain to stir debate. For much of the last decade, the natural gas industry has carefully cultivated a green reputation, often with the help of environmental groups that embrace the resource as a clean-burning “bridge fuel” to a renewable energy future. The industry argues that it has vastly reduced the amount of fugitive methane with new technologies and upgraded pipe fittings and other equipment.Mark D. Whitley, a senior vice president for engineering and technology with Range Resources, a gas drilling company with operations in several regions of the country, said the losses suggested by Mr. Howarth’s study were simply too high.“These are huge numbers,” he said. “That the industry would let what amounts to trillions of cubic feet of gas get away from us doesn’t make any sense. That’s not the business that we’re in.”Natural gas is already the principal source of heat in half of American households. Advocates like the former oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens have also long sought to promote it as a substitute for coal in electricity generation or gasoline in a new generation of natural gas cars. And the development of new ways to tap reserves of natural gas means production is likely to increase sharply.Two weeks ago, President Obama included natural gas in his vision for America. Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, said that the administration’s energy priorities were not about picking one energy source over another, but about diversifying the nation’s energy mix. “This process will continue to be based on the best science available to ensure our energy sources, including our nation’s natural gas reserves, are developed safely and responsibly,” Mr. Stevens said on Friday.The ability to pull natural gas economically from previously inaccessible formations deep underground has made huge quantities of the resource available in wide areas of the country, including Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Wyoming and Colorado.Such unconventional gas production accounts for nearly a quarter of total production in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. That is expected to reach 45 percent by 2035.But the cleanliness of natural gas is largely based on its lower carbon dioxide emissions when burned. It emits roughly half the amount of carbon dioxide as coal and about 30 percent less than oil.Less clear, largely because no one has bothered to look, are the emissions over its entire production life cycle — that is, from the moment a well is plumbed to the point at which the gas is used.Methane leaks have long been a concern because while methane dissipates in the atmosphere more quickly than carbon dioxide, it is far more efficient at trapping heat. Recent evidence has suggested that the amount of leakage has been underestimated. A report in January by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica, for example, noted that the Environmental Protection Agency had recently doubled its estimates for the amount of methane that is vented or lost from natural gas distribution lines.Chris Tucker, a spokesman for Energy in Depth, a coalition of independent oil and natural gas producers, dismissed Mr. Howarth as an advocate who is opposed to hydraulic-fracturing or “fracking,” a practice associated with unconventional gas development involving the high-pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to break up shale formations and release gas deposits. Mr. Howarth said his credentials as a scientist spoke for themselves.Mr. Howarth included methane losses associated with flow-back and drill-out processes in hydraulic fracturing and other unconventional gas drilling techniques.The study combined these emissions with studies of other methane losses along the processing and distribution cycle to arrive at an estimated total methane loss range from 3.6 to 7.9 percent for the shale gas industry.The researchers include a recent study from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA suggesting that an interaction of methane with certain aerosol particles significantly amplifies methane’s already potent greenhouse gas effects, particularly over a 20-year time horizon. When all is factored together, Mr. Howarth and his colleagues conclude that the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas can be as much as 20 percent greater than, and perhaps twice as high as, coal per unit of energy.David Hughes, a geoscientist and research fellow at the Post Carbon Institute, an energy and climate research organization in California, used Mr. Howarth’s research as part of a broader look at natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity generation and oil in transportation.Mr. Hughes’s full report is scheduled to be released in May, but in a draft version shared with The New York Times, Mr. Hughes suggested that while natural gas would play an important role in the nation’s energy mix, both cases were practical impossibilities.“I think it’s going to be very challenging, to put it mildly, to ramp up shale gas production by fourfold, which is the federal government’s projection for 2035,” Mr. Hughes said. “I’m not saying it can’t be done, but if it was done, the amount of drilling you’re looking at to make that happen is staggering.”Mr. Hughes, using Mr. Howarth’s calculations, also concludes that replacing coal with natural gas for base load electricity production will most likely make greenhouse gas emissions worse. It would be better, he argues, to improve energy efficiency, rely on natural gas in niche vehicle markets and balance continued construction of wind and solar power to produce electricity.David Hawkins, the director of climate programs with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that much could be done by regulators to nudge drillers to capture more of the fugitive methane, but that it is often more economical for industry to simply let it escape.Mr. Hawkins also said that too little was known about just how much methane was being lost and vented, and that studies like Mr. Howarth’s, while needed, relied on too slim a data set to be considered the final word.“This is a huge and growing industry, and we just don’t have the information we need to make sure that this resource is being developed as cleanly as it can be,” Mr. Hawkins said.“We view his shining a flashlight into this dark closet to be a service,” Mr. Hawkins added, “but the flashlight is still a dim one, and we still can’t see everything in the closet.”'"
"'11-04-12,'0','You could have learned some of this from the 1989 Harmonia Mundi recording of the work by Nicholas McGegan and the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, but not all of it. For Mr. Harnoncourt uses a new edition (by Terence Best, from 2010), based on “new insights and sources,” he writes in a performance note, that prove revelatory.In particular, he cites a more varied use of the viola da gamba and the deployment of a trombone. “In more than 50 years of performing,” he adds, “I’ve never encountered such a constellation.”The presence of the trombone makes all the difference, as the instrument tracks Lucifer in his misadventures with bloated arrogance or flatulence, as appropriate. Ruben Drole, a baritone, was delightful as the Devil, if that is not an oxymoron. And Dietmar Küblböck matched him beautifully on an antique trombone, playing with a power and bite that left the instrument’s immediate ancestor, the sackbut, a distant memory.The gambist’s duties were subtler and more diverse, and Christophe Coin handled them well, apart from a momentary lapse in concentration. Others played splendidly too, in an orchestration that gave even the bassoonist and the massed cellists and double-bassists opportunities to shine.As for the other vocalists, the soprano Christine Schäfer, as the Angel, provided a spark and a spunk that effectively offset Mr. Drole’s persona. Her slightly disembodied tone and a certain skittishness in her coloratura seemed appropriate to her incorporeal character.Another soprano, Roberta Invernizzi, supplied a more human quality as Mary Magdalene and impressed both in her grief, and in her rejoicing at Jesus’ resurrection. Wiebke Lehmkuhl, the contralto, as Mary Cleophas, was a fit partner in her duet with Ms. Invernizzi and really shone in her late aria questioning the little birds and brooklets in search of her redeemer.The tenor Toby Spence made the most of the colorless character of John, singing with solid, attractive tone and good agility.Mr. Harnoncourt presided over it all with a sure and flexible hand, allowing the singers rhythmic liberties and evidently encouraging them to add lavish embellishments in repeated material. All this imparted life to somewhat predictable alternations of recitatives and da capo arias that could have grown tedious.The performance was recorded for broadcast on Swiss radio on Easter Sunday and possible broadcast on American radio.The 23-year-old Lucerne Easter Festival is an offshoot of the Lucerne Festival in summer, which was founded by Arturo Toscanini in 1938 in opposition to the Nazi-controlled Salzburg Festival in Austria. Lucerne was never a serious rival to Salzburg in sheer quantity, but it has provided many worthy events over the decades.Blessed with the acoustical excellence of the KKL hall, which opened in 1998, and guided by Michael Haefliger, who became executive director in 1999, the festival has positively thrived. It is now home to the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, conducted by Claudio Abbado, and the Lucerne Festival Academy, directed by Pierre Boulez.And this year, especially, the Easter festival has come into its own. Three concerts of Brahms by Bernard Haitink and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe are part of a cycle that will conclude during the summer. Mr. Haitink will also present a master class in conducting from Friday through Sunday.In addition, the events this week include performances of Monteverdi’s 1610 Vespers, by Jordi Savall and the Concert des Nations and Capella Reial de Catalunya; Bach’s “St. John Passion,” by Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Choir and Orchestra; Liszt’s “Solemn Mass for the Dedication of the Basilica in Gran,” by Nicolás Pasquet and forces from Weimar, Bayreuth and Lucerne; and Tchaikovsky’s opera “Eugene Onegin” in a concert version, by Mariss Jansons and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. As if that weren’t enough, the mountains have — so far, at least, and to the evident astonishment of the local population, to say nothing of a New Yorker — served up a glorious feast of spring weather.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','Spring always brings a rash of sneezing, sniffling and stuffy noses. But can seasonal allergies be psychologically harmful?A wave of emerging research suggests that may be the case. While there’s no firm evidence that allergies cause depression, large studies show that allergy sufferers do seem to be at higher risk of depression.Severe allergies can bring sleeplessness, headaches, fatigue and a general feeling of physical depletion, all of which can worsen mood. Studies have found that allergic reactions release compounds in the body called cytokines, which play a role in inflammation and may reduce levels of the hormone serotonin, which helps maintain feelings of well-being. And it’s well known that some common allergy medications, like corticosteroids, can cause anxiety and mood swings.Several large studies have found that the risk of depression in people with severe allergies is about twice that of those without allergies. In 2008, researchers at the University of Maryland reported that this link may help explain a widely established — but poorly understood — increase in suicides during the spring every year. Analyzing medical records, the authors found that in some patients, changes in allergy symptoms during low- and high-pollen seasons corresponded to changes in their depression and anxiety scores.A Finnish population study in 2003 found a link between allergies and depression; however, women were much more likely to be affected. In 2000, a study of twins in Finland also showed a shared risk for depression and allergies, a result of genetic influences, the authors wrote.Severe seasonal allergies may be a risk factor for depression.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','TEHRAN — A member of the Iranian parliament has blamed Western “enemies” for a blast on Friday that hit a major gas pipeline near the holy city of Qom.The head of the parliament’s national security committee, Parviz Sorouri told reporters on Sunday that Western-backed “terrorists” were aiming to bring insecurity to Iran’s national energy transfer routes.“By issuing resolutions and organizing terrorist activities, Western countries are aiming to redirect the events in Bahrain and Libya toward Iran,” Sorouri said.Iranian officials continue to investigate the exact cause of the explosion, which struck a 56-inch diameter gas line near Qom early on Friday morning. No one was hurt in the blast.The apparent bomb attack was the second incident in two months. Earlier, simultaneous explosions hit three different points on a gas pipeline within about 60 miles of the location of Friday’s blast.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','The 11th Circuit is hearing a case filed in Pensacola, Fla., by Republican governors and attorneys general from 26 states. The federal district judge in that case, Roger Vinson, decreed that the entire health care act should be invalidated, but stayed his ruling until the Supreme Court settled the matter.In Missouri, a ballot referendum aimed at nullifying the law was approved by nearly three to one last year, and the legislature recently passed resolutions urging Mr. Koster to join the legal challenges. The state’s lieutenant governor, a Republican, filed a lawsuit last year seeking to block the law.In a letter to the Republican leaders of the legislature announcing his decision to oppose the law, Mr. Koster acknowledged that the legislative resolutions, though nonbinding, were “impactful, as they give voice to the political will of Missourians.”Although he supports an expansion of health coverage, he wrote, his duty is “to the law, and not to a political outcome.”Though Mr. Koster has been slow to weigh in, he did not mince words, arguing in the court brief that Congress had overstepped its authority by mandating that individuals buy health insurance, which he called “a substantial blow to federalism and personal freedom.”“If Congress can force activity under the Commerce Clause, then it could force individuals to receive vaccinations or annual checkups, undergo mammogram or prostate exams or maintain a specific body mass,” he wrote.He asked that the mandate be stripped from the law, and that the rest of it be allowed to remain in effect.His central argument echoed those made by plaintiffs in a number of the lawsuits, but it was noteworthy coming from a Democrat. The only Democratic state official who has joined the litigation as a plaintiff, Attorney General Buddy Caldwell of Louisiana, switched to the Republican Party in February.For Mr. Koster, who was elected in 2008, the decision to oppose his party on such a high-profile issue reflects the political challenges for Missouri Democrats in the coming election cycle.Though this state has long been viewed as a political bellwether, the politics of the electorate have grown more conservative in recent years, and Barack Obama narrowly lost the state in 2008.Mr. Koster, who is up for re-election next year along with the state’s two top Democrats, Gov. Jay Nixon and Senator Claire McCaskill, has already faced questions about his political loyalties.Known as a Republican moderate, he became a Democrat just months before announcing his candidacy for attorney general, succeeding despite criticism of the move from both parties, including being pinned with the nickname Koster the Imposter.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','Stocks mostly fell on Monday as energy shares sold off on lower oil prices and the onset of earnings season was clouded by concern that company outlooks may fall short of expectations.Worries increased over the costs of raw materials and the effects from Japan’s earthquake.“Companies are going to be trying to dampen expectations for the second quarter,” said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. “The market focus is more internal as to whether it’s gone up too fast.”After the bell, the aluminum maker Alcoa reported a first-quarter profit that beat estimates and said its outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond remained positive. But revenue of Alcoa, the first Dow component to report quarterly results, missed forecasts. Shares fell less than 1 percent in regular trading, to $17.77, then fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading.Shares of energy companies dropped as oil prices slid on profit-taking. Occidental Petroleum fell 3.2 percent, to $100.42, while the Standard & Poor’s energy index was down 1.9 percent.Profits for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index are likely to be up 11.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, but much of that may be priced into shares.'"
"'11-04-12,'0','Recent sudden cardiac deaths among high school athletes — including the death in March of a 16-year-old Michigan basketball player who had just scored a game-winning shot — have renewed questions about how common the risk is and whether athletes should be screened more carefully.A new study, published last week in the journal Circulation, offers a partial answer, finding that there is one sudden cardiac death for every 43,770 National Collegiate Athletic Association student-athletes each year. Earlier estimates, which relied almost exclusively on news reports, were as low as 1 in 300,000.The new study — which drew information from N.C.A.A. databases and insurance claims, as well as from news reports — examined sudden deaths from 2004 to 2008 among N.C.A.A. student-athletes ages 17 to 23.The study found that certain students were at higher risk, including black athletes and Division I basketball players. The incidence of sudden cardiac death among black athletes was one in 18,000, possibly because of a higher prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a leading cause of sudden cardiac death.Dr. Kimberly G. Harmon, a sports physician with the University of Washington and the study’s lead author, said athletes could be screened with electrocardiograms, a relatively inexpensive test for heart abnormalities.“Everyone else in the world does ECG screening as part of their sports screening,” she said.'"

"'11-04-13,'1','Mayor Vincent Gray of Washington was so angry that the budget deal prohibited his city from spending its own money on abortion that he blocked traffic outside the Capitol, getting arrested in the process.His rage was a sharp departure from the general self-congratulation of Democratic leaders and President Obama’s failure to tell the truth about the budget deal for this year: It ushers in a denuded era of loss to vital government services, mostly at the expense of the most vulnerable. If Mr. Obama and the Democrats believe in the promise of his campaign — that government must do what individuals cannot for themselves — they need to summon some new fighting strength.The bill contains enormous reductions in spending over the next six months — $38.5 billion over current spending, and another $40 billion below the amounts Mr. Obama had requested for the year. The withdrawal of that much money will cause significant damage to the economic recovery — neutralizing, in essence, much of the stimulative effect of last year’s payroll tax cut.But beyond that, the bill damages many of the government’s most important programs and will hurt those on the economy’s lowest rungs. Many of those cuts, in particular, satisfy ancient Republican ideological urges but have little or no effect on the long-term budget deficit.We do not advocate voting against the bill, unlike those on the right who are furious that the bill leaves standing federal agencies that they wanted to demolish. Doing so would cause another shutdown tailspin.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','Among the cuts were $49 million from programs relating to climate change, $438 million from programs supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy, $638 million from environmental cleanup efforts by the Defense Department and $997 million from revolving funds through which the Environmental Protection Agency provides money for local water treatment and pollution cleanup programs.The budget rider on the wolves, backed by two Western legislators — Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, and Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho — requires the Interior Department to adopt its earlier plan, removing wolves from the endangered list in those two states because it deemed that the states’ management plans, which include hunts of the animals, were acceptable.The rider also precluded judicial review of this provision.The wolf issue has great political resonance among the ranchers and hunters of Montana. The first group is concerned about livestock; the second about declines in elk and moose herds. Senator Tester is up for re-election in 2012.The fact that the department is being required to do what it had originally intended to do did not take the edge off arguments from environmental advocates that Congress had crossed a crucial line.Michael T. Leahy, the Rocky Mountain region director for the group Defenders of Wildlife, said in an interview Tuesday, “Now, anytime anybody has an issue with an endangered species, they are going to run to Congress and try to get the same treatment the anti-wolf people have gotten.”A spokeswoman for Interior Department said it would have no comment on the budget rider.State officials want the population culled because of the threat wolves pose to elk, moose and deer. Ron Aasheim, a spokesman for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said Tuesday, “We need to be able to manage them as a state to balance them with other wildlife and landowner impacts pertinent to livestock.”The two sides had recently reached a proposed settlement of a federal lawsuit brought by environmental groups against the Fish and Wildlife Service and Idaho and Montana officials. But the judge, Donald W. Molloy, rejected the settlement.Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, declined to comment on how all the proposed cuts would affect operations at his department. He did note that the agency responsible for regulating offshore oil and gas development would get an increase in money, allowing it to hire dozens of new inspectors, scientists and other officials.Interior Department officials would not discuss the bill’s elimination of a program to expand wilderness areas in the West, a program prized by Mr. Salazar but bitterly opposed by many lawmakers from the region who argue that it will limit development of natural resources, hunting and recreational uses of public lands.The National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service take relatively modest cuts.Conservation programs at the Department of Agriculture will be reduced by $800 million, while the agency’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program will be cut by $350 million, essentially ending its financing for the rest of the fiscal year, officials said.An E.P.A. spokesman, Brendan Gilfillan, said agency staff members were reviewing the spending measure. “We will have more details when that review is complete,” he said.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','Market contagion and rating downgrades, starting when the magnitude of Greece’s difficulties surfaced in early 2010, have become a self-fulfilling prophecy: by raising Portugal’s borrowing costs to unsustainable levels, the rating agencies forced it to seek a bailout. The bailout has empowered those “rescuing” Portugal to push for unpopular austerity policies affecting recipients of student loans, retirement pensions, poverty relief and public salaries of all kinds.The crisis is not of Portugal’s doing. Its accumulated debt is well below the level of nations like Italy that have not been subject to such devastating assessments. Its budget deficit is lower than that of several other European countries and has been falling quickly as a result of government efforts.And what of the country’s growth prospects, which analysts conventionally assume to be dismal? In the first quarter of 2010, before markets pushed the interest rates on Portuguese bonds upward, the country had one of the best rates of economic recovery in the European Union. On a number of measures — industrial orders, entrepreneurial innovation, high-school achievement and export growth — Portugal has matched or even outpaced its neighbors in Southern and even Western Europe.Why, then, has Portugal’s debt been downgraded and its economy pushed to the brink? There are two possible explanations. One is ideological skepticism of Portugal’s mixed-economy model, with its publicly supported loans to small businesses, alongside a few big state-owned companies and a robust welfare state. Market fundamentalists detest the Keynesian-style interventions in areas from Portugal’s housing policy — which averted a bubble and preserved the availability of low-cost urban rentals — to its income assistance for the poor.A lack of historical perspective is another explanation. Portuguese living standards increased greatly in the 25 years after the democratic revolution of April 1974. In the 1990s labor productivity increased rapidly, private enterprises deepened capital investment with help from the government, and parties from both the center-right and center-left supported increases in social spending. By the century’s end the country had one of Europe’s lowest unemployment rates.In fairness, the optimism of the 1990s gave rise to economic imbalances and excessive spending; skeptics of Portugal’s economic health point to its relative stagnation from 2000 to 2006. Even so, by the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, the economy was again growing and joblessness was falling. The recession ended that recovery, but growth resumed in the second quarter of 2009, earlier than in other countries.Domestic politics are not to blame. Prime Minister José Sócrates and the governing Socialists moved to cut the deficit while promoting competitiveness and maintaining social spending; the opposition insisted it could do better and forced out Mr. Sócrates this month, setting the stage for new elections in June. This is the stuff of normal politics, not a sign of disarray or incompetence as some critics of Portugal have portrayed it.Could Europe have averted this bailout? The European Central Bank could have bought Portuguese bonds aggressively and headed off the latest panic. Regulation by the European Union and the United States of the process used by credit rating agencies to assess the creditworthiness of a country’s debt is also essential. By distorting market perceptions of Portugal’s stability, the rating agencies — whose role in fostering the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States has been amply documented — have undermined both its economic recovery and its political freedom.In Portugal’s fate there lies a clear warning for other countries, the United States included. Portugal’s 1974 revolution inaugurated a wave of democratization that swept the globe. It is quite possible that 2011 will mark the start of a wave of encroachment on democracy by unregulated markets, with Spain, Italy or Belgium as the next potential victims.Americans wouldn’t much like it if international institutions tried to tell New York City, or any other American municipality, to jettison rent-control laws. But that is precisely the sort of interference now befalling Portugal — just as it has Ireland and Greece, though they bore more responsibility for their fate.Only elected governments and their leaders can ensure that this crisis does not end up undermining democratic processes. So far they seem to have left everything up to the vagaries of bond markets and rating agencies.'"

"'11-04-13,'1','The debate over the new language of the Mass is fundamentally a power struggle. All the linguistic, grammatical, stylistic, lexical, poetical and theological issues are really beside the point.It’s about power. The Catholic hierarchy suffered a blow when Vatican II opened windows and doors and, theoretically at least, gave lay Catholics a voice in their church that they had not had before. The conservative hierarchy didn’t like that one bit. Then came the sex abuse/cover-up scandal, an even greater blow to the authority and credibility of the hierarchy.The strategy of forcing languages to imitate Latin, even if it means disfiguring them, is an attempt to get back some lost power.Catholics will pray in the language we give you because we say so, and there is no reason you should expect to be consulted. Get back in line; Vatican II is over.The new translation of the Roman Missal will indeed cause some initial discomfort and confusion among the Catholic faithful, but a long-term result could well be a spiritual renewal.When I began working on my new book detailing the new language, I came with a feeling of trepidation. But the more I researched the reasons for the changes, and understood the scriptural underpinnings in many cases, the more I began to look forward to the revision.Now as I sit at Mass, I find myself quietly reciting the new language, even as the priest and those around me continue for now with the old.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','The Texas slugger Josh Hamilton is expected to miss six to eight weeks after breaking his upper right arm on a headfirst dive into home plate Tuesday, a dash he later called “stupid.”Hamilton, the reigning American League most valuable player, tried to score from third on a foul popup near the Detroit dugout in the first inning. Third baseman Brandon Inge and catcher Victor Martinez chased the ball, leaving the plate unprotected.Inge made the catch, then tossed the ball to Martinez, who scampered back in time to tag Hamilton.“It was a stupid play,” Hamilton said. “The whole time the ball was in the air, the coach was yelling, ‘Go, there’s no one at home,’ and I was thinking, ‘I don’t want to do this, something is going to happen.’ ”Hamilton slid headfirst earlier in the inning on a run-scoring triple. The Tigers won, 5-4, on Miguel Cabrera’s two-out single in the bottom of the ninth.Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels defended the decision by third-base coach Dave Anderson to send Hamilton.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','Wolfers’s conclusion comes in part from the statistical “smoking gun” he found in his study, that in games in which a team is favored by, say, 12 points, there is an excess of 10- and 11-point victories and too few 13- and 14-point wins. But he cautioned that the statistical evidence should not be mistaken for F.B.I. evidence.“There’s a smoking gun, but it shouldn’t be taken as more than a smoking gun,” Wolfers said.St. Joseph’s Coach Phil Martelli called the San Diego story a “punch in the gut,” but still has a hard time imagining that fixing games is commonplace. He said that in an era of instant communication, suspicions would be more frequent.“I think that there would be more mud flowing through the river with people making accusations,” he said. “People just aren’t quiet and discretionary.”Federal authorities did not specify which San Diego game or games were compromised, only saying in the indictment that the former San Diego star Brandon Johnson “attempted to influence and influenced the outcome of a U.S.D. basketball game for a monetary bribe” in February 2010. They also said that Thaddeus Brown, an assistant at San Diego in 2006-7, and Brandon Dowdy, who played at San Diego in 2006-7 and transferred to U.C.-Riverside, approached a player at Riverside this season.Jay Kornegay, the vice president for race and sports book operations at the Las Vegas Hilton, said that one San Diego game from the 2009-10 season raised slight suspicions, and that came on Dec. 4, 2009, when odds on San Diego’s game at U.C.-Riverside opened with San Diego as a 2 ½-point favorite and closed with San Diego as a 1-point underdog. Riverside won, 58-55. Johnson shot 2 for 10 for San Diego, and Dowdy shot 1 for 4.“We’re still looking into some other games,” Kornegay said. “We haven’t come up with anything. We haven’t had a chance to go through it thoroughly.”Gambling on sports has long had the attention of the N.C.A.A., but it has proved difficult to reduce. A 2008 study by the N.C.A.A., showed that 1.6 percent of men’s basketball players said they had been asked to influence the outcome of a game, 2 percent had bet on their own team and 1.4 percent had bet on another team at their own university.The N.C.A.A. pours hundreds of thousands of dollars each year into gambling prevention. F.B.I. agents speak to the teams in the men’s and women’s Round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament, and a consultant monitors point spreads in Las Vegas. But in a case like San Diego’s, enforcement can be difficult. The San Diego indictments, for example, grew out of an investigation into marijuana distribution.“I think you hit on a core issue when you’re talking about sports wagering, the fact is that it’s often connected to organized crime in some way,” Roe Lach said. “In trying to uncover a sports-wagering issue, it usually involves a much deeper ring that falls way outside the N.C.A.A.’s jurisdiction.”'"
"'11-04-13,'1','Erosion can do major damage to water quality, silting streams and lakes and dumping fertilizers and pesticides into the water supply. Fertilizer runoff is responsible for a vast “dead zone,” an oxygen-depleted region where little or no sea life can exist, in the Gulf of Mexico. And because it washes away rich topsoil, erosion can threaten crop yields. Significant gains were made in combating erosion in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the federal government began to require that farmers receiving agricultural subsidies carry out individually tailored soil conservation plans.Those plans often included measures such as terracing steep ground or sowing buffer strips with perennial grasses to stabilize areas prone to erosion, such as the edges of fields near streams or borders between crops.Many farmers, such as Mr. Hammitt, who is on the board of the Harrison County soil and water conservation district, also do little or no plowing and leave crop residues on harvested fields, techniques that reduce runoff.But environmentalists claim that enforcement of conservation plans by the United States Department of Agriculture is not as strict as it should be and that the gains in fighting erosion have stalled or are being undercut.U.S.D.A. data shows that the amount of farmland erosion nationwide from water fell substantially from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, then largely stagnated.Enforcement is needed more than ever, environmentalists say, because high crop prices provide a strong incentive for farmers to plant as much ground as possible and to take fewer protective measures like grass buffer strips.Other factors are also at work. Farmers increasingly rent the land they cultivate, which can mean they are less familiar with areas at risk for erosion or are less invested in caring for the land over the long run. In addition, farmers using modern supersize tractors, built to efficiently cover swaths of land, can find it inconvenient to break up land into smaller sections through buffer areas or terraces. Widely used herbicides can kill the grass in buffer strips, leaving them more vulnerable to erosion. And government biofuels policies that have increased the demand for corn have encouraged farmers to plant more. “You’ve got all these market forces and public policies and biofuel mandates and more severe storms,” said Craig Cox, senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that will release a report on erosion Wednesday. “It’s all coming together, and we’re asleep at the switch.”Mr. Cox said that he flew over parts of Iowa in a helicopter last spring after a severe storm and found that deep gullies had formed in unprotected farmland, becoming conduits for soil runoff. Farmers frequently level off such gullies after harvesting in the fall, he said, and then replant the same low-lying areas year after year, leaving them susceptible to further erosion.Thomas W. Christensen, an Agriculture Department regional conservationist, disagreed, saying, “Conservation compliance is working,” and adding that improvements to its enforcement program were in the works. Last year, however, the agency reviewed fewer than 1 percent of the tracts nationwide that it considered highly erodible to make sure that farmers were following conservation plans. About 1 percent of those reviewed were found to be in violation. But the new federal budget deal cuts 12 percent from the agency’s conservation spending, which could hamper soil efforts. Agency officials said they were still assessing the impact.The information from the Iowa Daily Erosion Project paints a grimmer picture than a recent assessment by federal officials. The U.S.D.A’s 2007 National Resources Inventory, released last year, estimated that erosion in Iowa averaged 5.2 tons an acre each year. That was slightly higher than the five tons per acre that the department estimated was a tolerable annual rate of erosion for most Iowa soils, meaning that it allowed a high level of crop productivity to be maintained indefinitely.Five tons of soil would fill a small dump truck; spread over an acre it would make a layer slightly less than the thickness of a dime, Mr. Cruse said.While the federal report estimates average rates of erosion for states and regions over a full year, the Erosion Project uses detailed information on rainfall and field conditions to estimate soil loss in 1,581 Iowa townships — nearly all of them — after each storm. Last year, according to Erosion Project data analyzed by the Environmental Working Group, the average estimated rate of erosion exceeded the sustainable level in 133 townships. In 2009, an estimated 641 townships exceeded the sustainable rate, including nearly 400 that had double or more that rate.The project also provides a picture of the erosion caused by severe storms, like the one that dumped more than seven inches of rain in parts of southwest Iowa in May 2007. In a single day, the figures show, 69 townships had average estimated soil losses of more than 10 tons an acre. Of those, 14 townships were estimated to have an average loss between 20 tons and nearly 40 tons per acre. The 2007 storm was exceptionally damaging, but severe storms are becoming more frequent, according to a state report on climate change submitted in January to the Iowa Legislature and governor.Despite the concerns, Iowa is not on the brink of becoming a new Dust Bowl. Many farmers use good conservation practices, and the state’s rich topsoil in many areas is deep enough to last decades with moderate amounts of erosion.But agronomists say that heavy erosion in unprotected areas can significantly diminish crop yields, and, over time, land that is not well cared for can become depleted. That means farmers must use more fertilizer to increase yields.Erosion also does major harm to water quality.More than anything else this year, farmers are making decisions based on how they can best take advantage of corn and soybean prices, which have soared in recent months.Dr. Cruse said that creates a paradox. When crop prices are low and farmers are scraping by, many say they cannot afford to take steps to protect their fields from erosion. Now, he said, they say they still cannot afford it because there is too much profit to be made from farming every bit of land.The same incentives have landowners clearing steep hillsides or converting pasture to cropland to cultivate or rent out.“The requests to farm the marginal areas and the pressure on our noncropped areas have really increased with these commodity prices,” said Todd G. Duncan, an Agriculture Department district conservationist in Winneshiek County in northeast Iowa, another area of the state with steep hills. “We have some people that are making bad land-use decisions right now.”'"
"'11-04-13,'1','To forestall that fate for other brands, Kraft executives are initiating a project called Operation Spark, meant to help consumers reconnect with products that are not part of what Kraft calls its roster of “power brands,” which includes behemoths like Planters, Oreo, Ritz and Trident.The brands the executives hope to keep from the ghostly ranks include the Athenos line of Greek-style dips, spreads and yogurt; dairy products that are sold in the East under the Breakstone’s name and in the West as Knudsen; and Stove Top stuffing.Those brands are getting new campaigns and other promotional support, including television commercials for Breakstone’s and Knudsen that began on Monday. The brands also all have new agencies.Kraft spent only $331,000 last year to advertise Breakstone’s and Knudsen, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, which tracks ad spending in major media, compared with $10.2 million in 2009.Stove Top, too, had a ghostly presence last year, Kantar reported, as spending totaled just $65,000, compared with $2.7 million in 2009.For those smaller brands, “we want to find ways to be entrepreneurial,” said Dana Anderson, senior vice president for marketing strategy and communications at the Kraft headquarters in Northfield, Ill.“We’ve been changing the conversation with our consumers because the marketing landscape has changed so much,” she added.A central element of Operation Spark is to pair the smaller brands with creative agencies that have outstanding reputations for effective, rule-breaking advertising — and have not previously worked for Kraft.“We all know there was much more we could be doing creatively,” said Howard Friedman, senior vice president of marketing for cheese and dairy products, based in the Kraft office in Glenview, Ill.“It’s part of liberating our smaller brands,” he added.So Athenos was assigned to Droga5 in New York, known for campaigns for the Tap Project, a Unicef water charity, and Reb’l Fleur by Rihanna, a Parlux Fragrances perfume. Droga5 created a campaign for Athenos infused with offbeat humor, featuring a salty yiayia, or Greek grandmother, who dislikes just about everything except, of course, Athenos.Breakstone’s, Knudsen and Stove Top were assigned to the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., perhaps best known for its ads for Geico.“It’s an open door,” said Noël Talluto, senior brand manager for Breakstone’s, “an opportunity to bring some fresh thinking to the brand.”“One thing we did differently was that we as a brand team came in open-minded and remained open-minded through the entire process,” she added, “allowing the creative juices to flow.”The campaign from Martin, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, presents the Breakstone’s and Knudsen dairy products as “the food your other food loves.” For example, in commercials cartons of sour cream serenade potatoes with “Keep on Loving You” by REO Speedwagon.“What voice do we want this brand to have?” asked Ty Harper, vice president and senior art director at Martin. “It should be fun, because it’s fun food; you can’t tell me anything bad that has sour cream in it.”Rob Robb, vice president and account director at Martin, said: “Kraft gave us a lot of creative freedom. We were not tied to the more rigid work that’s associated with packaged goods.”For Stove Top, Martin has brought out that brand’s most extensive campaign since 2007, when, according to Kantar, Kraft spent $9.5 million to advertise Stove Top in major media.The campaign, which includes digital and outdoor ads, social media, coupons and promotions in stores, presents Stove Top as “the un-potato,” an alternative to the usual side dishes. (Shades of the vintage campaign that proclaimed 7Up as “the uncola.”)Martin has also been named the creative agency for other smaller Kraft brands like Cool Whip and Polly-O cheese.Kraft is turning over some bigger brands to agencies with which it had not worked before, among them Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners, which is creating campaigns for Jell-O and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.“We are in the early stages of transformation,” Ms. Anderson said. “We’re going to learn, and even if we fall and skin our knees, we’ll get back up and stay committed.”'"
"'11-04-13,'1','It surprises no one that Cohen, with a net worth valued at $8 billion, might be interested in the Mets. It is of some surprise to people who know him that he might be seriously interested in a minority stake, one that would not give him control over the team’s operations and finances and performance. And it is completely in keeping with his custom to have zero interest in revealing his hand.Cohen, who was born in Great Neck, N.Y., and Katz have a charitable connection. Katz is a former chairman and current executive committee member of the board of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System — to which Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, donated $50 million last year to fund pediatric care.Cohen’s inclusion in the group of finalists bidding for the Mets would mean that he was persuaded to alter his insistence on some measure of control — or envisions a future route to control. Katz and Wilpon have told all bidders they will not sell more than 49 percent of the team and no part of their two-thirds stake in the SNY cable network for at least a year. Bidders have coveted a piece of SNY because its profits could offset team losses that rose to about $50 million last season.Cohen’s competitors include a group formed by Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, a hedge-fund firm, and James McCann, the founder of 1-800-Flowers.com, a Mets sponsor, according to a person briefed on the matter. The two visited Fred Wilpon in spring training last month at Port St. Lucie, Fla.Out of the bidding is an investment group formed by David Heller, a Goldman Sachs executive, and Marc Spilker, president of Apollo Global Management, and another comprised of Leo Hindery, a media investor, and Marc Utay, managing partner of Clarion Capital, a private equity firm. The status of a third syndicate, led by Steven Starker, a co-founder of BTIG, a global trading firm, could not be confirmed.Cohen runs SAC Capital Advisors, a powerful $12 billion hedge fund headquartered in Stamford, Conn. He has posted some of the best investment performances on Wall Street, generating annualized returns of about 30 percent over nearly two decades.Over the past two years, Cohen has elevated his former low profile, speaking at conferences and stepping up his philanthropy. He also frequently shows up at art shows, where he looks to add to a world-class collection of paintings by artists including Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns.SAC has been touched by the government’s widespread crackdown into insider trading at hedge funds. Last November, SAC received a subpoena as part of the investigation. In February, federal prosecutors announced insider trading charges against two former SAC portfolio managers. One has pleaded guilty to criminal charges and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for the firm, has said the firm is outraged by the alleged actions of the former employees.And, last month, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Cohen’s former wife, Patricia, that claimed he hid millions of dollars from her during their divorce 20 years earlier.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','And for producers, flash sites might turn out to be a sophisticated sales team, giving customers information about the wines — and winemakers information about the customers. Until recently, wineries rarely had problems selling their bottles to a public with mounting thirst. But as a result of the recession and a consolidation of distributors that has made it tougher for wineries to get their products into stores, some winemakers have watched entire vintages stack up.Enter the flash sites. A welcome pressure valve for the industry, flash sales have allowed wineries, particularly at the middle and higher end, to unload huge numbers of bottles in staggeringly short times, albeit at drastically reduced prices. Not long ago, WineAccess blew out the better part of 700 cases — 8,400 bottles — of 2006 Keenan Merlot in under 24 hours. The profits on such sales may be small or nonexistent, but at least they give the wineries cash to pay for the next vintage’s barrels and grapes.Even in the depths of the recession, though, many in the industry were powerfully averse to slashing prices.Jack Stuart, the winemaker for Benessere Vineyards in Napa Valley, recalled that, after he had sold some wine through a flash site, the owner of the site talked about establishing a long-term relationship.“I sort of laughed to myself, thinking ‘This is not a sustainable business model,’ ” he said. “There’s no way we could afford to sell a significant proportion of our production this way.”As the recovery creeps forward, resistance to slashing prices is apt to grow. Gary Vaynerchuk, the online wine marketing phenomenon behind Wine Library and Wine Library TV, predicts that the wine surplus will last longer than some producers expect, but that eventually “things will go back to normal.” When that happens, he said, flash sites will be forced to evolve, and some will probably not survive. Their style of doing business may make the difference.Most flash sites operate under one of two models. Some are retailers, negotiating tremendous discounts, buying the wines either directly from the winery or through wholesalers, and then fulfilling the orders themselves. Mr. Vaynerchuk’s Cinderella Wine is in this category, as is Wines Til Sold Out. These sites tend to feel like online analogues of stores like Costco — cavernous and devoid of personality, but exuding a no-nonsense, deep-discount vibe.The other model for a flash site is the marketing agent that sells wine but never takes possession of it, leaving the hassles of shipping legalities and order fulfillment to the wineries. These sites, like Wine.Woot and Lot18, specialize in “hand-selling” bottles, in part by educating consumers about the wineries.Many in the wine industry say that in the post-surplus world, these sites are better positioned to succeed because they can help wineries build their brands, communicate directly and creatively with customers, and create interactive communities of buyers.Wine.Woot, the first flash site, which made its debut in May 2006, offers literary narratives to accompany its daily 24-hour deals. (A recent sale of Riverbench pinot noir fronted a hard-boiled scenario that began, “It was a cold, gray night in Baghdad by the Bay. ... A thick fog hung on anything foolish enough to be outside, but I had more pressing worries. There, in the doorway to my office, stood the Riverbench Winery Estate Pinot Noir 4-Pack gang.”) Each sale is accompanied by a “vintner voice mail” with the winemaker talking about the bottle. Winemakers also chat online throughout the day with Wine.Woot’s highly active and engaged community.Matt Licklider, a founder of the Lioco winery in California, was skeptical about flash sites, but recently gave Wine.Woot a try. He liked the experience, particularly the time he spent interacting with consumers on the site’s chat board.“I had probably 25 different conversations going on simultaneously with a group of people I regarded to be quite savvy about wine,” Mr. Licklider said.The Wine.woot model, he said, might promise a cheaper and faster way of doing business. “If I have to sell wine at wholesale cost to Wine.Woot, that’s essentially the same price that I would sell to distributors in various states. Then I would have to buy a plane ticket, fly to visit the market, stay in a hotel, rent a car, take the distributor and his salespeople out to dinner and spend three days selling all that wine. You can see how inefficient and expensive all that is.”The Wine Spies has a hybrid model, offering both a marketing and retail component, as well as a gimmick. The site casts sales as “missions” in which two characters known as Agent Red and Agent White are charged with tracking down wines. Along the way, the site provides quite a bit of information, including lengthy winemaker interviews. Discounts of at least 20 percent are part of the business model, said Jason Seeber, a k a Agent Red, but are not the sole point of the site.“That discount is meant really to entice people who might otherwise hesitate to buy a wine they don’t know,” he said. “If we’re selling this wine at 25 percent off with a very detailed review and a comprehensive interview with the winemaker and we really tell the story of the wine in a very accurate way, all those things are going to lower the barrier to entry.” The Wine Spies has experienced annual double-digit growth since its debut in 2007, Mr. Seeber said.Besides helping to reach more customers in less time, flash sites that specialize in marketing can also provide the kind of direct connection that can be hard for winemakers to come by. “Outside of direct-to-consumer sales, wineries are pretty much ignorant as to who’s buying their wine,” said Paul Mabray, the chief strategy officer of VinTank. “They sell it to the wholesaler, retailer or restaurant instead of the actual consumer, so their guess is as good as any who’s actually buying it.”Other flash sites are evolving to build relationships with customers beyond their monitors. Eric Bolen, a marketing consultant for WineAccess, has recently started offering “private sales” of exclusive wines to their best customers. “We then deliver all the names to the winery, who then sends them a handwritten note inviting them in for a special private tasting,” he said.Likewise, Mr. Greenlee of Amedeo said that he is working with One King’s Lane, a discount home-décor site that recently added wine to its portfolio, to package wines with experiences like vineyard tours and meals at the winery.“The wineries are interested in keeping the relationship with customers beyond the sale,” he said. Mr. Greenlee added that such package deals might be a way to reach new customers beyond the hard-core consumers who are, he said, the primary users of sites like Wineaccess.com.Whatever the future holds, the fate of online wine retail will no doubt be dynamic. “It’ll be fun to see who’s got the chops to do different things off the platform they’ve created,” Mr. Vaynerchuk said. “To see who just ends up being a flash and who ends up being a flash in the pan.”'"
"'11-04-13,'1','PARIS — Saudi Arabia has maintained its role this year as the world’s oil producer of last resort, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.When output from Libya declined this year, Saudi Arabia opened the spigots. And when demand fell as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the country tightened them back down.The Saudis raised output an average of 310,000 barrels a day in the first three months of the year, to 8.88 million barrels a day, with expectations that production would hold at more than 9 million barrels in March. But the quake and tsunami that hit north of Tokyo changed the equation, cutting Japanese demand and leading to the diversion of Japan-bound Saudi oil tankers to other countries.“As a result, Saudi Aramco is thought to have throttled back production in mid-March,” the agency said, referring to the state-owned oil company.The agency estimated that the effects of the earthquake would cut second-quarter demand by 270,000 barrels a day, easing upward pressure on prices.But for the rest of the year, it said, increased Japanese oil use for power generation and reconstruction would make up the difference. The agency, therefore, left intact its 2011 demand forecast at 89.4 million barrels a day, up 1.6 percent from 2010.'"
"'11-04-13,'1','Stocks on Wall Street were dragged down by tumbling crude oil prices and weaker commodity markets on Tuesday as investors expected lower demand in Japan in the aftermath of the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear crisis.Some analysts said oil prices had been due for a correction, with the speculative nature of the markets one reason behind its recent rise. Prices had risen in recent weeks on a weaker dollar and heightened concern over the potential for oil supply disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa.On Tuesday, however, crude oil prices turned decidedly lower after weeks of hitting highs not seen since September 2008. Oil fell 3.3 percent, to $106.25 a barrel in New York trading, while Brent crude fell 1.6 percent, to $121.04 in London.Prices for other commodities were also lower, including gold, silver, copper, cotton and corn.Economists at Capital Economics said that Japan was just one factor in the overall weakness in commodity prices.“More generally, we have been arguing for some time that these prices would soon reach danger levels that would undermine demand and contribute, in time, to sharp falls,” Capital Economics said in a report.'"

"'11-04-14,'1','His worry, according to these people, sprang from a desire to calm markets, a goal that could be complicated by a hard-charging attorney general.Asked whether the unusual meeting had altered his approach, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, now New York’s governor, said Wednesday evening that “Mr. Geithner never suggested that there be any lack of diligence or any slowdown.” Mr. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary, said through a spokesman that he had been focused on A.I.G. “to protect taxpayers.”Whether prosecutors and regulators have been aggressive enough in pursuing wrongdoing is likely to long be a subject of debate. All say they have done the best they could under difficult circumstances.But several years after the financial crisis, which was caused in large part by reckless lending and excessive risk taking by major financial institutions, no senior executives have been charged or imprisoned, and a collective government effort has not emerged. This stands in stark contrast to the failure of many institutions in the late 1980s. In the wake of that debacle, special government task forces referred 1,100 cases to prosecutors, resulting in more than 800 bank officials going to jail. Among the best-known: Charles H. Keating Jr., of Lincoln Savings and Loan in , and David Paul, of Centrust Bank in .Former prosecutors, lawyers, bankers and employees say that investigators and regulators ignored past lessons about how to crack financial fraud.As the crisis was starting to deepen in the spring of 2008, the scaled back a plan to assign more field agents to investigate mortgage fraud. That summer, the Justice Department also rejected calls to create a task force devoted to mortgage-related investigations, leaving these complex cases understaffed and poorly funded, and only much later established a more general financial crimes task force.Leading up to the financial crisis, many officials said in interviews, regulators failed in their crucial duty to compile the information that traditionally has helped build criminal cases. In effect, the same dynamic that helped enable the crisis — weak regulation — also made it harder to pursue fraud in its aftermath.A more aggressive mind-set could have spurred far more prosecutions this time, officials involved in the S.&L. cleanup said.“This is not some evil conspiracy of two guys sitting in a room saying we should let people create crony capitalism and steal with impunity,” said William K. Black, a professor of law at , , and the federal government’s director of litigation during the savings and loan crisis. “But their policies have created an exceptional criminogenic environment. There were no criminal referrals from the regulators. No fraud working groups. No national task force. There has been no effective punishment of the elites here.”Even civil actions by the government have been limited. The adopted a broad guideline in 2009 — distributed within the agency but never made public — to be cautious about pushing for hefty penalties from banks that had received bailout money. The agency was concerned about taxpayer money in effect being used to pay for settlements, according to four people briefed on the policy but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.To be sure, Wall Street’s role in the crisis is complex, and cases related to mortgage securities are immensely technical. Criminal intent in particular is difficult to prove, and banks defend their actions with documents they say show they operated properly.But legal experts point to numerous questionable activities where criminal probes might have borne fruit and possibly still could.Investigators, they argue, could look more deeply at the failure of executives to fully disclose the scope of the risks on their books during the mortgage mania, or the amounts of questionable they bundled into securities sold to investors that soured.Prosecutors also could pursue evidence that executives knowingly awarded bonuses to themselves and colleagues based on overly optimistic valuations of mortgage assets — in effect, creating illusory profits that were wiped out by subsequent losses on the same assets. And they might also investigate whether executives cashed in shares based on inside information, or misled regulators and their own boards about looming problems., for example, understated its risky mortgage holdings by hundreds of billions of dollars. And public comments made by , the chief executive of , praising his mortgage company’s practices were at odds with derisive statements he made privately in e-mails as he sold shares; the stock subsequently fell sharply as the company’s losses became known.Executives at assured investors in the summer of 2008 that the company’s financial position was sound, even though they appeared to have counted as assets certain holdings pledged by Lehman to other companies, according to a person briefed on that case. At , the first major Wall Street player to collapse, a private litigant says evidence shows that the firm’s executives may have pocketed revenues that should have gone to investors to offset losses when complex mortgage securities soured.But the Justice Department has decided not to pursue some of these matters — including possible criminal cases against Mr. Mozilo of Countrywide and Joseph J. Cassano, head of Financial Products at A.I.G., the business at the epicenter of that company’s collapse. Mr. Cassano’s lawyers said that documents they had given to prosecutors refuted accusations that he had misled investors or the company’s board. Mr. Mozilo’s lawyers have said he denies any wrongdoing.Among the few exceptions so far in civil action against senior bankers is a lawsuit filed last month against top executives of , the failed bank now owned by . The sued Kerry K. Killinger, the company’s former chief executive, and two other officials, accusing them of piling on risky loans to grow faster and increase their compensation. The S.E.C. also extracted a $550 million settlement from for a mortgage security the bank built, though the S.E.C. did not name executives in that case.Representatives at the Justice Department and the S.E.C. say they are still pursuing financial crisis cases, but legal experts warn that they become more difficult as time passes.“If you look at the last couple of years and say, ‘This is the big-ticket prosecution that came out of the crisis,’ you realize we haven’t gotten very much,” said David A. Skeel, a law professor at the . “It’s consistent with what many people were worried about during the crisis, that different rules would be applied to different players. It goes to the whole perception that Wall Street was taken care of, and Main Street was not.”As nonprosecutions go, perhaps none is more puzzling to legal experts than the case of Countrywide, the nation’s largest mortgage lender. Last month, the office of the attorney for dropped its investigation of Mr. Mozilo after the S.E.C. extracted a settlement from him in a civil fraud case. Mr. Mozilo paid $22.5 million in penalties, without admitting or denying the accusations.White-collar crime lawyers contend that Countrywide exemplifies the difficulties of mounting a criminal case without assistance and documentation from regulators — the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Fed, in Countrywide’s case.“When regulators don’t believe in regulation and don’t get what is going on at the companies they oversee, there can be no major white-collar crime prosecutions,” said Henry N. Pontell, professor of criminology, law and society in the School of Social Ecology at the . “If they don’t understand what we call collective embezzlement, where people are literally looting their own firms, then it’s impossible to bring cases.”Financial crisis cases can be brought by many parties. Since the big banks’ mortgage machinery involved loans on properties across the country, attorneys general in most states have broad criminal authority over most of these institutions. The Justice Department can bring civil or criminal cases, while the S.E.C. can file only civil lawsuits.All of these enforcement agencies traditionally depend heavily on referrals from bank regulators, who are more savvy on complex financial matters.But data supplied by the Justice Department and compiled by a group at show that over the last decade, regulators have referred substantially fewer cases to criminal investigators than previously.The university’s ’Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse indicates that in 1995, bank regulators referred 1,837 cases to the Justice Department. In 2006, that number had fallen to 75. In the four subsequent years, a period encompassing the worst of the crisis, an average of only 72 a year have been referred for criminal prosecution.Law enforcement officials say financial case referrals began declining under President Clinton as his administration shifted its focus to health care fraud. The trend continued in the Bush administration, except for a spike in prosecutions for , WorldCom, Tyco and others for accounting fraud.The Office of Thrift Supervision was in a particularly good position to help guide possible prosecutions. From the summer of 2007 to the end of 2008, O.T.S.-overseen banks with $355 billion in assets failed.The thrift supervisor, however, has not referred a single case to the Justice Department since 2000, the data show. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a unit of the Treasury Department, has referred only three in the last decade.The comptroller’s office declined to comment on its referrals. But a spokesman, Kevin Mukri, noted that bank regulators can and do bring their own civil enforcement actions. But most are against small banks and do not involve the stiff penalties that accompany criminal charges.Historically, Countrywide’s bank subsidiary was overseen by the comptroller, while the supervised its home loans unit. But in March 2007, Countrywide switched oversight of both units to the thrift supervisor. That agency was overseen at the time by John M. Reich, a former banker and Senate staff member appointed in 2005 by President .Robert Gnaizda, former general counsel at the Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit consumer organization in , Calif., said he had spoken often with Mr. Reich about Countrywide’s reckless lending.“We saw that people were getting bad loans,” Mr. Gnaizda recalled. “We focused on Countrywide because they were the largest originator in and they were the ones with the most exotic mortgages.”Mr. Gnaizda suggested many times that the thrift supervisor tighten its oversight of the company, he said. He said he advised Mr. Reich to set up a hot line for whistle-blowers inside Countrywide to communicate with regulators.“I told John, ‘This is what any police chief does if he wants to solve a crime,’ ” Mr. Gnaizda said in an interview. “John was uninterested. He told me he was a good friend of Mozilo’s.”In an e-mail message, Mr. Reich said he did not recall the conversation with Mr. Gnaizda, and his relationships with the chief executives of banks overseen by his agency were strictly professional. “I met with Mr. Mozilo only a few times, always in a business environment, and any insinuation of a personal friendship is simply false,” he wrote.After the crisis had subsided, another opportunity to investigate Countrywide and its executives yielded little. The , created by Congress to investigate the origins of the disaster, decided not to make an in-depth examination of the company — though some staff members felt strongly that it should.In a January 2010 memo, Brad Bondi and Martin Biegelman, two assistant directors of the commission, outlined their recommendations for investigative targets and hearings, according to Tom Krebs, another assistant director of the commission. Countrywide and Mr. Mozilo were specifically named; the memo noted that subprime mortgage executives like Mr. Mozilo received hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation even though their companies collapsed.However, the two soon received a startling message: Countrywide was off limits. In a staff meeting, deputies to Phil Angelides, the commission’s chairman, said he had told them Countrywide should not be a target or featured at any hearing, said Mr. Krebs, who said he was briefed on that meeting by Mr. Bondi and Mr. Biegelman shortly after it occurred. His account has been confirmed by two other people with direct knowledge of the situation.Mr. Angelides denied that he had said Countrywide or Mr. Mozilo were off limits. Chris Seefer, the F.C.I.C. official responsible for the Countrywide investigation, also said Countrywide had not been given a pass. Mr. Angelides said a full investigation was done on the company, including 40 interviews, and that a hearing was planned for the fall of 2010 to feature Mr. Mozilo. It was canceled because Republican members of the commission did not want any more hearings, he said.“It got as full a scrub as A.I.G., Citi, anyone,” Mr. Angelides said of Countrywide. “If you look at the report, it’s extraordinarily condemnatory.”The Justice Department in Washington was abuzz in the spring of 2008. Bear Stearns had collapsed, and some law enforcement insiders were suggesting an in-depth search for fraud throughout the mortgage pipeline.The F.B.I. had expressed concerns about mortgage improprieties as early as 2004. But it was not until four years later that its officials recommended closing several investigative programs to free agents for financial fraud cases, according to two people briefed on a study by the bureau.The study identified about two dozen regions where mortgage fraud was believed rampant, and the bureau’s criminal division created a plan to investigate major banks and lenders. , the director of the F.B.I., approved the plan, which was described in a memo sent in spring 2008 to the bureau’s field offices.“We were focused on the whole gamut: the individuals, the mortgage brokers and the top of the industry,” said Kenneth W. Kaiser, the former assistant director of the criminal investigations unit. “We were looking at the corporate level.”Days after the memo was sent, however, prosecutors at some Justice Department offices began to complain that shifting agents to mortgage cases would hurt other investigations, he recalled. “We got told by the D.O.J. not to shift those resources,” he said. About a week later, he said, he was told to send another memo undoing many of the changes. Some of the extra agents were not deployed.A spokesman for the F.B.I., Michael Kortan, said that a second memo was sent out that allowed field offices to try to opt out of some of the changes in the first memo. Mr. Kaiser’s account of pushback from the Justice Department was confirmed by two other people who were at the F.B.I. in 2008.Around the same time, the Justice Department also considered setting up a financial fraud task force specifically to scrutinize the mortgage industry. Such task forces had been crucial to winning cases against Enron executives and those who looted savings and loans in the early 1990s., a former federal judge in New York who had been the head of the Justice Department less than a year when Bear Stearns fell, discussed the matter with deputies, three people briefed on the talks said. He decided against a task force and announced his decision in June 2008.Last year, officials of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission interviewed Mr. Mukasey. Asked if he was aware of requests for more resources to be dedicated to mortgage fraud, Mr. Mukasey said he did not recall internal requests.A spokesman for Mr. Mukasey, who is now at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, said he would not comment beyond his F.C.I.C. testimony. He had no knowledge of the F.B.I. memo, his spokesman added.A year later — with precious time lost — several lawmakers decided that the government needed more people tracking financial crimes. Congress passed a bill, providing a $165 million budget increase to the F.B.I. and Justice Department for investigations in this area. But when lawmakers got around to allocating the budget, only about $30 million in new money was provided.Subsequently, in late 2009, the Justice Department announced a task force to focus broadly on financial crimes. But it received no additional resources.In July 2008, the staff of the S.E.C. received a phone call from Scott G. Alvarez, general counsel at the Federal Reserve in Washington.The purpose: to discuss an S.E.C. investigation into improprieties by several of the nation’s largest brokerage firms. Their actions had hammered thousands of investors holding the short-term known as auction-rate securities.These investments carry interest rates that reset regularly, usually weekly, in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that sell them. They were popular among investors because the interest rates they received were slightly higher than what they could earn elsewhere.For years, companies like and Goldman Sachs operated auctions of these securities, promoting them as highly liquid investments. But by mid-February 2008, as the began to spread, investors holding hundreds of billions of dollars of these securities could no longer cash them in.As the S.E.C. investigated these events, several of its officials argued that the banks should make all investors whole on the securities, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations but who were not authorized to speak publicly, because banks had marketed them as safe investments.But Mr. Alvarez suggested that the S.E.C. soften the proposed terms of the auction-rate settlements. His staff followed up with more calls to the S.E.C., cautioning that banks might run short on capital if they had to pay the many billions of dollars needed to make all auction-rate clients whole, the people briefed on the conversations said. The S.E.C. wound up requiring eight banks to pay back only individual investors. For institutional investors — like pension funds — that bought the securities, the S.E.C. told the banks to make only their “best efforts.”This shift eased the pain significantly at some of the nation’s biggest banks. For , the new terms meant it had to redeem $7 billion in the securities for individual investors — but it was off the hook for about $12 billion owned by institutions. These institutions have subsequently recouped some but not all of their investments. Mr. Alvarez declined to comment, through a spokeswoman.An S.E.C. spokesman said: “The primary consideration was remedying the alleged wrongdoing and in fashioning that remedy, the emphasis was placed on retail investors because they were suffering the greatest hardship and had the fewest avenues for redress.”A similar caution emerged in other civil cases after the bank bailouts in the autumn of 2008. The S.E.C.’s investigations of financial institutions began to be questioned by its staff and the agency’s commissioners, who worried that the settlements might be paid using federal bailout money.Four people briefed on the discussions, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that in early 2009, the S.E.C. created a broad policy involving settlements with companies that had received taxpayer assistance. In discussions with the Treasury Department, the agency’s division of enforcement devised a guideline stating that the financial health of those banks should be taken into account when the agency negotiated settlements with them.“This wasn’t a political thing so much as, ‘We don’t know if it makes sense to bring a big penalty against a bank that just got a check from the government,’ ” said one of the people briefed on the discussions.The people briefed on the S.E.C.’s settlement policy said that, while it did not directly affect many settlements, it slowed down the investigative work on other cases. A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.The final chapter still hasn’t been written about the financial crisis and its aftermath. One thing has been especially challenging for regulators and law enforcement officials: balancing concerns for the state of the financial system even as they pursued immensely complicated cases.The conundrum was especially clear back in the fall of 2008 when Mr. Geithner visited Mr. Cuomo and discussed A.I.G. Asked for details about the meeting, a spokesman for Mr. Geithner said: “As A.I.G.’s largest creditor, the New York Federal Reserve installed new management at A.I.G. in the fall of 2008 and directed the new C.E.O. to take steps to end wasteful spending by the company in order to protect taxpayers.”Mr. Cuomo’s office said, “The attorney general went on to lead the most aggressive investigation of A.I.G. and other financial institutions in the nation.” After that meeting, and until he left to become governor, Mr. Cuomo focused on the financial crisis, with mixed success. In late 2010, Mr. Cuomo sued the accounting firm , accusing it of helping its client Lehman Brothers “engage in massive accounting fraud.”To date, however, no arm of government has sued Lehman or any of its executives on the same accounting tactic.Other targets have also avoided legal action. Mr. Cuomo investigated the 2008 bonuses that were paid out by giant banks just after the bailout, and he considered bringing a case to try to claw back some of that money, two people familiar with the matter said. But ultimately he chose to publicly shame the companies by releasing their bonus figures.Mr. Cuomo took a tough stance on . While the S.E.C. settled its case with Bank of America without charging any executives with wrongdoing, Mr. Cuomo filed a civil fraud lawsuit against , the former chief executive, and the bank’s former chief financial officer. The suit accuses them of understating the losses of Merrill Lynch to shareholders before the deal was approved; the case is still pending.Last spring, Mr. Cuomo issued new mortgage-related subpoenas to eight large banks. He was interested in whether the banks had misled the ratings agencies about the quality of the loans they were bundling and asked how many workers they had hired from the ratings agencies. But Mr. Cuomo did not bring a case on this matter before leaving office.'"

He decided against a task force and announced his decision in June 2008.Last year, officials of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission interviewed Mr. Mukasey. Asked if he was aware of requests for more resources to be dedicated to mortgage fraud, Mr. Mukasey said he did not recall internal requests.A spokesman for Mr. Mukasey, who is now at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, said he would not comment beyond his F.C.I.C. testimony. He had no knowledge of the F.B.I. memo, his spokesman added.A year later — with precious time lost — several lawmakers decided that the government needed more people tracking financial crimes. Congress passed a bill, providing a $165 million budget increase to the F.B.I. and Justice Department for investigations in this area. But when lawmakers got around to allocating the budget, only about $30 million in new money was provided.Subsequently, in late 2009, the Justice Department announced a task force to focus broadly on financial crimes. But it received no additional resources.In July 2008, the staff of the S.E.C. received a phone call from Scott G. Alvarez, general counsel at the Federal Reserve in Washington.The purpose: to discuss an S.E.C. investigation into improprieties by several of the nation’s largest brokerage firms. Their actions had hammered thousands of investors holding the short-term known as auction-rate securities.These investments carry interest rates that reset regularly, usually weekly, in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that sell them. They were popular among investors because the interest rates they received were slightly higher than what they could earn elsewhere.For years, companies like and Goldman Sachs operated auctions of these securities, promoting them as highly liquid investments. But by mid-February 2008, as the began to spread, investors holding hundreds of billions of dollars of these securities could no longer cash them in.As the S.E.C. investigated these events, several of its officials argued that the banks should make all investors whole on the securities, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations but who were not authorized to speak publicly, because banks had marketed them as safe investments.But Mr. Alvarez suggested that the S.E.C. soften the proposed terms of the auction-rate settlements. His staff followed up with more calls to the S.E.C., cautioning that banks might run short on capital if they had to pay the many billions of dollars needed to make all auction-rate clients whole, the people briefed on the conversations said. The S.E.C. wound up requiring eight banks to pay back only individual investors. For institutional investors — like pension funds — that bought the securities, the S.E.C. told the banks to make only their “best efforts.”This shift eased the pain significantly at some of the nation’s biggest banks. For , the new terms meant it had to redeem $7 billion in the securities for individual investors — but it was off the hook for about $12 billion owned by institutions. These institutions have subsequently recouped some but not all of their investments. Mr. Alvarez declined to comment, through a spokeswoman.An S.E.C. spokesman said: “The primary consideration was remedying the alleged wrongdoing and in fashioning that remedy, the emphasis was placed on retail investors because they were suffering the greatest hardship and had the fewest avenues for redress.”A similar caution emerged in other civil cases after the bank bailouts in the autumn of 2008. The S.E.C.’s investigations of financial institutions began to be questioned by its staff and the agency’s commissioners, who worried that the settlements might be paid using federal bailout money.Four people briefed on the discussions, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that in early 2009, the S.E.C. created a broad policy involving settlements with companies that had received taxpayer assistance. In discussions with the Treasury Department, the agency’s division of enforcement devised a guideline stating that the financial health of those banks should be taken into account when the agency negotiated settlements with them.“This wasn’t a political thing so much as, ‘We don’t know if it makes sense to bring a big penalty against a bank that just got a check from the government,’ ” said one of the people briefed on the discussions.The people briefed on the S.E.C.’s settlement policy said that, while it did not directly affect many settlements, it slowed down the investigative work on other cases. A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.The final chapter still hasn’t been written about the financial crisis and its aftermath. One thing has been especially challenging for regulators and law enforcement officials: balancing concerns for the state of the financial system even as they pursued immensely complicated cases.The conundrum was especially clear back in the fall of 2008 when Mr. Geithner visited Mr. Cuomo and discussed A.I.G. Asked for details about the meeting, a spokesman for Mr. Geithner said: “As A.I.G.’s largest creditor, the New York Federal Reserve installed new management at A.I.G. in the fall of 2008 and directed the new C.E.O. to take steps to end wasteful spending by the company in order to protect taxpayers.”Mr. Cuomo’s office said, “The attorney general went on to lead the most aggressive investigation of A.I.G. and other financial institutions in the nation.” After that meeting, and until he left to become governor, Mr. Cuomo focused on the financial crisis, with mixed success. In late 2010, Mr. Cuomo sued the accounting firm , accusing it of helping its client Lehman Brothers “engage in massive accounting fraud.”To date, however, no arm of government has sued Lehman or any of its executives on the same accounting tactic.Other targets have also avoided legal action. Mr. Cuomo investigated the 2008 bonuses that were paid out by giant banks just after the bailout, and he considered bringing a case to try to claw back some of that money, two people familiar with the matter said. But ultimately he chose to publicly shame the companies by releasing their bonus figures.Mr. Cuomo took a tough stance on . While the S.E.C. settled its case with Bank of America without charging any executives with wrongdoing, Mr. Cuomo filed a civil fraud lawsuit against , the former chief executive, and the bank’s former chief financial officer. The suit accuses them of understating the losses of Merrill Lynch to shareholders before the deal was approved; the case is still pending.Last spring, Mr. Cuomo issued new mortgage-related subpoenas to eight large banks. He was interested in whether the banks had misled the ratings agencies about the quality of the loans they were bundling and asked how many workers they had hired from the ratings agencies. But Mr. Cuomo did not bring a case on this matter before leaving office.'"

"'11-04-14,'1','It was the fourth straight playoff overtime game the Rangers have lost since 2007.The eighth-seeded Rangers took a 1-0 lead when defenseman Matt Gilroy scored at 1:56 into the third period when he one-timed Wojtek Wolski’s setup into the top corner.But Alex Ovechkin equaled the count with 6:16 left on a goal that seemed to result from a late whistle. Ovechkin shouldered Dan Girardi to the ice and shoveled the loose rebound of Semin’s shot underneath Henrik Lundqvist (31 saves) after a long scramble while Lundqvist was on his knees, trying to cover the puck. The net came off its moorings moments after the puck crossed the line.The goal was upheld after a video review and ignited the crowd.“It looks like the ref is looking to blow his whistle, but I’m not sure what his thinking was,” Rangers Coach John Tortorella said. “They called it a goal, I’m not going to whine about it.”Lundqvist regarded it as just a bad break.“I was hoping for a whistle — the puck was there for a long time — but they never blew the whistle,” Lundqvist said. “They kept knocking at it. I’m pretty much stuck there, hoping for a whistle or someone to clear the puck, but the whistle never came.”Semin was one of the players poking at the puck during the scrum.“Henrik Lundqvist is a great goalie, and it’s very difficult to score an easy one on him,” Semin said. “So we scored a junk goal — just pushed it in. Whatever worked.”The Capitals outshot the Rangers, 33-25, but that was only what got through to Lundqvist and Michael Neuvirth of Washington. The Rangers blocked an additional 28 shots. The Capitals blocked 32.Ovechkin, who entered the game with 20 goals and 20 assists in 48 playoff games, started out in runaway-locomotive mode, intent on putting Washington into an early lead. He started by firing a difficult laser from the face-off circle 4:44 into the game, but Lundqvist stopped it with his waffle pad.However, on a power play less than two minutes later, he tried three shots in a row, and none of them got through. The first was blocked by Brandon Dubinsky, the second by Girardi, and the third by Chris Drury.It was that kind of work that kept Ovechkin in check, at least until his late junk goal that evened the score.With Staal and Girardi watching him closely all night, Ovechkin finished with six shots in 26:46 of ice time, but he had another seven blocked.Ovechkin also led all players in hits, with six.“He’s a great player, everyone knows that,” Girardi said. “You’ve got to be physical on him and take his time and space away. He got that stuff-in goal there, but I didn’t really see what happened.”That was because Ovechkin had knocked Girardi down on the play.“It’s the playoffs and we don’t give up,” Ovechkin said. “We play hard and score some dirty goals, but it is what it is.”Neuvirth, a rookie, had his best moment eight minutes into the second period. Marian Gaborik was left alone in front and redirected Brian Boyle’s pass right on goal, but Neuvirth absorbed it in his chest without allowing a rebound.Neuvirth was making his Stanley Cup playoff debut, but he has plenty of postseason experience. He was the goalie for the Ontario Hockey League champion, Plymouth, in 2007 and won back-to-back A.H.L. championships with Hershey in 2009 and 2010.The teams meet again here Friday night.“I think we did a lot of good things,” Boyle said. “It’s going to be a tough series. We want to play stingy, frustrate them, play hard and play physical. We’re obviously not happy with the outcome, but we’re going to regroup and be positive for Game 2.”'"
"'11-04-14,'1','Representative of , the No. 3 House Republican, said: “We have cut spending. We know this is a long road up to that shiny city on the hill, and we just believe we’ve just got to one more peak. And we’ll continue to fight.”The resistance to the spending measure came after reviews of the proposal found that some significant cuts, including some involving health care, are not expected to produce real savings. This is because the money was not likely to be spent for years though it can be counted as a current reduction under budget rules.According to a comparison, the bill would produce only $350 million in tangible savings this year, partly because cuts in domestic programs were offset by an increase of about $5 billion for Pentagon programs.When projected emergency contingency spending overseas is figured in by the budget office, estimated outlays for this year actually increase by over $3 billion.The agreement does put the brakes on what had been a steady growth in spending by federal agencies. Future savings would be greater as the cuts took hold — a point Republican aides emphasized by noting that the plan is estimated to cut spending by $312 billion over the next decade.“Big stuff,” said Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican and leading conservative who said he intended to support the measure.At a closed-door party meeting Wednesday, lawmakers warned their leaders that they needed to defend the deal from attacks from the right if they hoped to hold most of their members together.Congressional officials were a bit rueful that a delay in getting the measure completed until early Tuesday morning meant they had to postpone the vote until Thursday, giving opposition an extra day to build. A test vote clearing the way for debate on the spending bill easily cleared the House on Wednesday.Several Democrats said they intended to vote for the proposal. Representative , Democrat of , said he believed the final deal cut by Mr. Boehner, and Senator , the Democratic majority leader, represented sensible cuts that protected crucial education programs.After the House acts, the Senate is expected to consider the plan. Republican opposition was emerging there as well, though approval seemed likely.Senator , a freshman Republican from , said Wednesday that he would join other conservatives expected to reject the plan. “We can do better; we must do better,” he said in a statement.After the spending vote Thursday that has been complicated by conservative criticism that the compromise does too little, the House leadership must turn around on Friday and sell a long-term budget plan that some Republicans worry goes too far.The spending blueprint written by Representative , the Wisconsin Republican who leads the Budget Committee, includes a politically charged proposal to fundamentally reconfigure . The vote is made dicier by the fact that the Medicare initiative is unlikely to reach the floor of the Senate this session, leaving House Republicans alone in their stance.While the budget has strong conservative support, some House Republicans in Democratic-leaning districts have said they remain undecided about how they will vote. Even Representative of , the majority leader, acknowledged on Wednesday that the Republican budget “defied all political convention” by focusing on such a popular program.Representative Steve Southerland II, a freshman Republican from , said he was still studying the budget proposal. “Medicare is the one entitlement of great concern,” he said.House Democrats were going to put forward their own budget plan, which they said would make serious reductions in the deficit without undermining social programs cut by the Republican plan.Since Republicans cannot count on any Democratic support for their budget, they can afford to lose only two dozen Republicans and still approve the measure, which the leadership has embraced as its signature statement on reducing the deficit.Speaker Boehner declared in no uncertain terms just where he stood.Mr. Ryan said he did not envision great difficulty in winning passage of his proposal.“We are excited and looking forward to bringing it to the floor,” Mr. Ryan said. “We are confident.”'"
"'11-04-14,'1','FINA has said it will issue its own report. The recommendations of the commission, which was appointed last fall by USA Swimming, include minimum and maximum temperature limits, the deployment of well-positioned rescue personnel, a system of communication between water-based personnel and those on land, and a means of keeping track of all the competitors during the races, which are held in oceans or lakes.“We hope this will dramatically reduce the kinds of risks that clearly led to Fran Crippen’s death,” Pound said.A statement released by the Crippens said, in part, “As a family, we know we cannot change the circumstances that led to the tragedy that occurred on October 23rd, but it is our goal to honor Fran and his legacy by looking to the future and advocating for” athletes’ safety.Diana Nyad, an open-water swimmer who has set several world records, including circling Manhattan in 7 hours 57 minutes in 1975, said by telephone: “All the proposals are fantastic. They will help.”Nyad is part of open-water swimming’s long and storied history. While open swimming fame can be traced to 1875, when Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim across the English Channel, it is new to the Olympic scene. The first Olympic medals in the sport were awarded at the 2008 Games in Beijing.The sport’s inclusion in the Summer Games has prompted many lap swimmers, used to competing in the controlled environment of pools, to cross over to open water, where the conditions are much less predictable.Crippen’s career arc was emblematic of this new wave of competitors. He was a finalist in the 400- and 1,500-meter freestyles at the 2004 United States Olympic trials and competed at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships in the 400 freestyle and the 800 freestyle relay before turning his attention to the open water.At the time of his death, Crippen was one of America’s more seasoned open-water swimmers. He had earned a gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in the 10K event and two years later won a bronze at the world championships.Educating the athletes in open-water events, Nyad said, is as important as safeguarding the courses. She said she had heard of open-water competitors employing the same race strategy in every race regardless of the conditions. She has heard of athletes being reluctant to hydrate when it is hot because they do not want to interrupt the rhythm of their stroke or because they believe they do not need to drink water since they are in the water.“It’s partly the newness of the sport,” Nyad said. “In the New York Marathon, the runners know that if they step to the starting line on an extremely hot day, they are going to have to adjust and adapt their strategy and their expectations accordingly. I don’t think a lot of the swimmers drawn to these open-water events are experienced enough to know this.”No member of the USA Swimming coaching staff or medical staff accompanied Crippen and other national team members to the competition in the United Arab Emirates, a lack of support Crippen addressed in an e-mail he sent to Chuck Wielgus, the executive director of USA Swimming, less than two weeks before the event.The coach of the United States open-water squad at last year’s Pan Pacific Championships was Bill Rose, whose background is only in pool swimming. On Wednesday, USA Swimming announced the hiring of Bryce Elser, a former collegiate swimmer and certified ocean lifeguard and lifeguard instructor, to the newly created post of open water program manager.Wielgus said USA Swimming would send a coach and support staff to World Cup events that featured a full United States contingent. At events the organization does not staff, Americans will be sent with a safety checklist.“The tragedy that occurred on Oct. 23,” Wielgus said during the teleconference, “has changed all our views toward open-water swimming dramatically.”'"
"'11-04-14,'1','ESPN announced a set of endorsement guidelines for its on-air announcers Wednesday that would have probably prohibited a deal made this year between Erin Andrews, one of its best-known reporters, and Reebok, and another one between Scott Van Pelt and Titleist.The Andrews-Reebok deal, which ESPN approved, would presumably violate a guideline against accepting endorsements tied to apparel, footwear and athletic equipment “used for training, playing or participating in any sport ESPN may cover, including the companies that manufacture” the products.Sandy Montag, who runs the broadcasting division of IMG, which represents numerous ESPN broadcasters, including Andrews and Van Pelt, said, “I have no problem with ESPN not allowing reporters and anchors to endorse products indigenous to the sports they cover.”Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman, said that because of Reebok’s and Titleist’s investments in their campaigns with Andrews and Van Pelt, the announcers can continue their associations for “a logical length of time.” Montag said they would finish their contracts, which each have a year or less remaining.The announcement of the Andrews-Reebok contract last January was followed by a report in The New York Times that Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso of ESPN’s “College GameDay” program have a joint deal to do speaking engagements for Nike. ESPN did not know about that deal and did not approve it.Fowler quickly dropped the deal, which would not have been approved under the new guidelines.But Corso and Herbstreit can maintain the arrangement because it comes under an exception in the guidelines that lets players and coaches who have become analysts keep such endorsements as “part of the sports coverage/reporting landscape.”ESPN underscored the importance of increasing its scrutiny of its broadcasters’ endorsements by saying it “will consider the potential for the company or product to become the subject of a sports news story or subject ESPN or the talent to a loss or the perceived loss of credibility or reputation.”'"
"'11-04-14,'1','FORT WORTH (AP) — American Airlines raised the stakes in its battle with ticket sellers by suing the travel Web site Orbitz and the distributor Travelport Ltd., accusing them of monopoly tactics.American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said the companies were trying to control the distribution of airline tickets to business travelers and were retaliating against it for objecting.Orbitz and Travelport denied American’s charges. Orbitz accused American of trying to limit customer choice and reduce competition.American’s antitrust lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Texas, is the latest twist in a battle that led American to remove its flight listings from Orbitz in December. American is trying to shift sales to its Web site to reduce the commissions it pays to online travel sites.In the lawsuit, American said most of its passenger revenue still came from tickets sold by travel agents who get information from so-called global distribution systems. Travelport owns three of the five big distribution systems, which handled $2.7 billion in American ticket sales last year.The airline wants to cut out the distribution systems by providing information about flights and fares directly to travel agents from its computer system.'"
"'11-04-14,'1','Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse'"
"'11-04-14,'1','Singled out for criticism is the Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversaw some of the nation’s most aggressive lenders, including Countrywide Financial, IndyMac and Washington Mutual, whose chief executive was Kerry Killinger. Noting that the agency’s officials viewed the institutions it regulated as “constituents,” the report said that the office relied on bank executives to correct identified problems and was reluctant to interfere with “even unsound lending and securitization practices” at Washington Mutual.The report describes how two risk managers at the bank were marginalized by its executives. One of them told the committee that executives began providing the regulator with outdated loss estimates as the mortgage crisis widened. After the risk manager told regulators that the estimates it had received were dated, Mr. Killinger fired him.From 2004 to 2008, for example, the regulatory office identified more than 500 serious deficiencies at Washington Mutual, yet did not force the bank to improve its lending operations, according to the report. And when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank’s backup regulator, moved to downgrade the bank’s safety and soundness rating in September 2008, John M. Reich, the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, wrote an angry e-mail to a colleague. Referring to Sheila Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, he wrote: “I cannot believe the continuing audacity of this woman.” Washington Mutual failed two weeks later.The office was abolished last year, and its operations were folded into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Reich declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Killinger did not respond to a request for comment.The report was produced by the same Senate committee that conducted an 11-hour hearing last April with Goldman executives and employees of its mortgage unit, who testified about their trading and securities underwriting practices.At the hearing, some lawmakers questioned Goldman’s assertion that it had not bet against the mortgage market as real estate prices collapsed. And on Wednesday, Senator Levin pointed out that his committee had found 3,400 places in Goldman documents where its officials used the phrase “net short,” a reference to negative bets.“Why would Goldman deny what was so obvious, that they were engaged in a huge short in the year 2007?” Senator Levin asked in a press briefing Wednesday morning. “Because they gained at the expense of their clients and they used abusive practices to do it.”The report uncovered a new aspect of Goldman’s mortgage activity during 2007. That year, as Goldman tried to build its bet against housing, the report says, it drove down the cost of shorting the mortgage market by squeezing those who had made negative bets. Goldman tried to put on the squeeze, the report noted, so that it could add to its negative bets more cheaply and protect itself against the housing collapse.Because Goldman was a large dealer in the marketplace, it had the power to drive prices in a certain direction. The report quotes from the self-evaluation of Deeb Salem, a mortgage trader, who wrote: “We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting very short again.” He added, “This strategy seemed do-able and brilliant.”Michael Swenson, head of trading in the structured product group at Goldman and Mr. Salem’s superior, also referred to the short squeeze, according to Senate investigators. In an e-mail, Mr. Swenson said that Goldman should “start killing” investors who were betting against mortgages. In testimony before the committee, however, he said he was simply trying to add balance to the market.Goldman abandoned its plan in June 2007 when two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed because of bad mortgage bets.A Goldman spokesman said in a statement: “While we disagree with many of the conclusions of the report, we take seriously the issues explored by the subcommittee. We recently issued the results of a comprehensive examination of our business standards and practices and committed to making significant changes that will strengthen relationships with clients, improve transparency and disclosure and enhance standards for the review, approval and suitability of complex instruments.”The report also sheds new light on the bundling and trading of mortgages at Deutsche Bank, which had also made negative bets in that market.Unlike Goldman, Deutsche Bank has not been accused of wrongdoing by government investigators. But the Senate report focuses on a trader named Greg Lippmann, who has since left the bank to join a hedge fund.Mr. Lippmann was vocally negative about housing as early as 2005 and brought his idea of shorting the market to professional investors on Wall Street. He described risky mortgage securities before the crisis as “pigs,” according to the report. When he was asked to buy one such mortgage security, he responded that he “would take it and try to dupe someone,” according to the report.Mr. Lippmann persuaded Deutsche to let him build a large short position, reaching $5 billion by 2007, the report says. The bank still lost money on other positive mortgage bets, but Mr. Lippmann’s trade helped reduce the company’s overall loss.The report focused on one Deutsche collateralized debt obligation from 2006, called Gemstone VII, and described how Deutsche and other banks made $5 million to $10 million for every deal like Gemstone they created. In 2006 and 2007, banks created about a trillion dollars of C.D.O. deals — the most complex type of mortgage security and the instruments that sent the lending craze to dizzying heights.In e-mails provided to the committee, Mr. Lippmann called the bank’s operation a “C.D.O. machine” and characterized such securities as a “Ponzi scheme.” But when the committee interviewed Mr. Lippmann, he backtracked, saying that his colorful descriptions were used to defend his negative view of the market.In the Senate interview, Mr. Lippmann also said that he thought he was the person who persuaded the American International Group to stop writing insurance on mortgage securities. He told the committee that the head of the Deutsche Bank group that put together C.D.O.’s was upset when Mr. Lippmann persuaded A.I.G. to exit the business in 2006. Without A.I.G. there to insure the instruments, it would be harder to keep these lucrative factories humming.Michele Allison, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said that the e-mails and other documents cited in the report indicated the divergent views within the bank about the housing market. “Despite the bearish views held by some, Deutsche Bank was long the housing market and endured significant losses,” she said in a statement.'"

"'11-04-14,'1','Mr. Zahedi, 50, who grew up mostly in Los Angeles and now teaches at the New School in Manhattan, said that he was fine with the first two prohibitions but that the third one bothered him — to the extent that it “kind of made me interested in actually saying yes to the proposal.”The hourlong film he eventually made after a short visit to Sharjah last winter with his wife, their toddler son and a small crew ended up chronicling how he went to Sharjah and, with no idea what to film there, essentially made a film about failing repeatedly to observe the third prohibition.“It is irreverent, but those are the kinds of films I make — I’m irreverent,” he said in a recent interview. He added, “I think because my parents are Iranian everyone thought that I would understand the Middle East, and they didn’t get that I was completely an American.” He said that he had never even heard of Sharjah before the invitation.Realizing that his approach would probably mean that none of the footage would be screened at the biennial, he edited the film into a kind of madcap meta-narrative, an open letter to the sheik asking him to allow the film to be shown, uncut and uncensored, thereby making it even more likely that it would be dropped from the biennial’s lineup — which is exactly what has happened.Mr. Zahedi is now locked in a battle with the Sharjah Art Foundation over whether the film, “Plot for a Biennial” (a wry play on the festival’s theme), will ever be screened anywhere. Last month the foundation’s lawyers sent him a letter demanding that all copies that made any reference to Sharjah, to the foundation or to the royal family — references that constitute the bulk of the film — be destroyed and that he never show the film in the form in which he made it.The principal offense cited in the letter is a brief scene — one that could run afoul of blasphemy laws in Sharjah and lead to jail time for anyone associated with it — showing a group of Indian children dancing in a public square; some of their movements, choreographed by Mr. Zahedi, mimic those of prayer, as a Bollywood soundtrack plays in the background.But Mr. Zahedi said he believed the demands for the destruction of the movie, and threats of legal action if he were to show it, have been prompted more by the royal family’s discomfort and by references that the film makes to Sharjah’s labor laws, which have been criticized for providing weak protections for the huge population of guest workers underpinning that emirate’s economy.The fight between Mr. Zahedi and the foundation over whether he can ever show the movie, being conducted by lawyers for both sides, is coming to light at probably the most difficult period for the biennial in its years of presenting art that often tiptoes along the boundaries of cultural and religious sensitivities. Last week the foundation’s director, Jack Persekian, was forced out of his position on orders from the sheik after a public outcry over an installation in the show, by Mustapha Benfodil, an Algerian writer and artist, that included explicit sexual references and mention of Allah. (Mr. Persekian was not involved in choosing that work; curators who did have defended the language used in it, which they say refers to the widespread use of rape by religious-extremist fighters during the decade-long civil war in Algeria.)Through a spokeswoman, officials at the foundation declined to comment on the dispute over the film, as did the curator who invited Mr. Zahedi to make it, Rasha Salti, and the biennial’s other lead curator, Suzanne Cotter, who is also developing exhibitions for the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, one of the region’s many enormous cultural projects, scheduled to open in 2013.In a letter that Mr. Persekian sent before he was fired, he wrote to Mr. Zahedi that he was personally shocked by the scene showing the children making prayer movements, and added that he thought any reasonable viewer would conclude it was “completely disrespectful of Islam.”Carol Solomon, an art historian at Haverford College who has focused on contemporary art in the Middle East and North Africa, said that while such sentiments have always been risky in the Middle Eastern art world, “right now everything that’s going on with the unrest in the region might be precipitating an environment where they’re saying, ‘No, we’re just not going to let things get pushed.’ ”But viewed another way, such conflicts could also be read as a sign of the biennial’s success, she added, proof at least of its willingness to allow curators and artists to test limits. “Sharjah has moved itself out into the wider international contemporary art world,” she said, “and in doing that it’s inevitable that it’s going to get people who are going to be provocative.”Mr. Zahedi, reflecting on the situation the other day back in Brooklyn — wearing a casual pinstriped jacket instead of the white kandura tunic and keffiyeh headdress he often wears in the movie, to comic effect — said that to settle his dispute with Sharjah, he would be willing to let anyone associated with the biennial go on camera and disassociate themselves completely from his work: in essence, to blame it all on him.“And I’d happily put it all in the finished film,” he said. “I mean, as long as it’s not boring or anything.”'"

Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, was fined 104 million euros. A German company, Henkel, escaped a fine in exchange for blowing the whistle on the cartel.The European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said that the companies had developed the cartel to make sure none gained a competitive advantage over the others while seeking to meet environmental goals.“They agreed to protect their respective market shares, they agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of the packages, and afterwards they even agreed on a price increase,” Mr. Almunia said.The companies formed the cartel after working on methods to reduce the weight of detergent powders and to reduce waste from boxes and bags through the Association for Soaps, Detergents and Maintenance Products, a trade association that includes other major home products companies.'"
"'11-04-14,'1','For March, sales of autos dropped 1.7 percent, the biggest decline since February 2010. However, some of the weakness was because General Motors scaled back incentive offers. Economists believe the outlook for auto sales for the rest of this year remains bright, given improving job prospects.Shoppers did spend 3.6 percent more at furniture stores. Sales were also rose at appliance stores and specialty clothing stores. Sales at general merchandise stores, the category that includes retailers like Wal-Mart, rose 0.4 percent.However, sales at department stores like Macy’s saw a 0.2 percent drop in March. A survey of major retailers last week from Costco to Victoria’s Secret had reported surprisingly good sales for March. Analysts said the gains would have been better but for the fact that Easter does not come until late April this year.In a related report, the Commerce Department said that businesses added to their stockpiles in February for a 14th consecutive month and sales increased for an eighth month. The gains suggest factory orders will rise in the coming months.Business inventories rose 0.5 percent in February, the agency reported. Combined sales by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers increased 0.2 percent during the month.Healthy gains in sales and inventory restocking should translate into strong orders placed with American factories.Manufacturing activity has increased in all but two months since the recession ended in June 2009, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Factories have benefited not only from increased demand in the United States but also from stronger export sales.The string of increases in inventories pushed stockpiles to $1.46 trillion in February. That is a level that economists consider to be normal for this stage of the recovery. It is 10.7 percent higher than the recent low of $1.32 trillion reached in September 2009.Businesses had slashed their stockpiles to control costs during the recession.For February, manufacturers increased their stocks by 0.8 percent and wholesale inventories rose 1 percent. Retailers reduced their inventories by 0.4 percent.Sales rose at the manufacturing and retail levels, but declined 0.8 percent at the wholesale level.'"
"'11-04-14,'1','This is not to say that the United States military has shied from trumpeting its sweeping aid operation, involving 18,000 people and 20 ships, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan. The Pentagon has dubbed it Operation Tomodachi, Japanese for “friend,” reflecting its goal of fostering good will in a nation that hosts 50,000 American troops .But this is a proud country that can grow touchy over the presence of the United States, which occupied Japan after World War II and helped configure its reborn military as a nonaggressive force limited to national security and self-defense. So American commanders have been careful to stress that they are in a supporting role, even in places like Sendai, where they were instrumental in fixing the airport.“We are used to doing this in third-world countries, where we have to come in and do it all,” said Col. James L. Rubino, commander of a Marine Corps logistics unit camped in tents on a Sendai Airport parking lot last week. “Here, we make sure the Japanese government and Self-Defense Force have the lead.”Colonel Rubino said that in a less developed nation, like Haiti or Indonesia, thousands of Marines would have been sent in with trucks, heavy equipment, their own engineers and medical staff. Here, he said, the Americans limited themselves to a skeleton crew of 260 Marines and soldiers who used two dozen trucks and construction vehicles to clear the airport and unload relief supplies.“There are concerns about us upstaging the Japanese Self-Defense Forces,” Colonel Rubino said.Near his unit’s tents, a small outfit of Japanese construction workers was at work washing away mud, rewiring lights and even using a small bulldozer to scoop debris from the baggage claim room.The situation was quite different after the Kobe earthquake in 1995. Then, Tokyo rejected assistance by the United States military, a decision that many Japanese criticized as possibly raising the death toll. This time, Tokyo accepted, and promptly.“It was amazing how quickly they could come in and move the debris and broken cars,” said Col. Makoto Kasamatsu of the Self-Defense Force.Colonel Kasamatsu leads a small group of Japanese soldiers who serve as coordinators between the Americans and the civilian airport authority, which is officially in charge of Sendai Airport and has also played a large role in the cleanup.Within minutes of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake on March 11, some 1,400 passengers and workers in the terminal suddenly found themselves surrounded by black, churning waves that crumpled parked aircraft like paper toys.The people were rescued, but the airport seemed a near total loss — until Col. Robert P. Toth, commander of the 353rd Special Operations Group, based in Okinawa, heard of the airport’s destruction. His unit specializes in turning ruined landing strips and patches of empty desert into forward supply bases for American aircraft, but usually in war-torn countries, like Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan.“It was clear that opening Sendai Airport was the No. 1 priority, but everyone had written it off,” Colonel Toth said. He approached his superiors with a plan to turn it into a hub for American relief.He said that when the unit made an initial helicopter survey the day after the earthquake, the airport was still under eight feet of water.When the unit arrived three days later, driving in on Humvees that been flown to a Japanese air base a few hours away, the first task was clearing enough of the runway for aircraft to land. In the following weeks, the Americans and Japanese moved more than 5,000 cars that had been washed onto the runway by the waves, lining them up in neat rows along the edge of airport.When they found bodies, they called over Japanese crews. They would not say how many bodies were found, out of respect for Japanese sensitivities.With the control tower damaged by the waves, the Americans ran the airport for weeks, guiding their military planes in and out from backpack radios. Ahead of Wednesday’s reopening, control was slowly restored to the Japanese.Since March 15, Colonel Toth said the Americans had used the airport to distribute more than two million tons of food, water and blankets.“This is what we do: look for a disaster, and set up a runway,” said Major Traxler of the Air Force. “But I have never seen this level of devastation, not even in combat.”'"
"'11-04-14,'1','According to Yipit, an aggregator of online daily deals, the number of sites offering health- and beauty-related services has nearly quintupled in the last year, to 341, while sales of these services (including spa treatments, dental whitening and hair salon services) reached $78 million for January to March of this year and are on track to reach $312 million for 2011, representing 31 percent of total daily deal sales.Shopping for beauty services online isn’t something Barbara Fisher, a sales associate for Coach in Manhattan, ever imagined doing, but since hearing about Lifebooker and a half-dozen deal sites through friends, she has bought vouchers for waxing and dental whitening trays and signed up for a free boot camp class.She is currently on the lookout for a deal on the keratin hair treatments that usually cost her $300 to $400 a few times a year. “I have a lot of upkeep,” said Ms. Fisher, 40. “I’m in the salon constantly. I will try to avoid paying full price if I can. It’s a recession.”But are beauty consumers really spending less or just buying more? Jessica Israel, a buyer of television commercial space for an advertising company in Westchester, recently purchased spray tanning, a haircut and a few massages for a discount online, all splurges she would not have tried otherwise.“I guess it’s the idea of getting a deal,” she said, adding that she wouldn’t get a spray tan again, or go back to one of the places where she had received a massage because she did not care for the ambience.From the merchants’ perspective, daily deal sites offer an opportunity to reach a large number of customers (Groupon, for example, has more than 70 million subscribers) without investing a great deal of money on advertising or marketing.Yvette Rose, the founder of the Kickstart Diet, said she had more than 5,000 views on her company Web site the day that her deal, 40 percent off a five-day food cleanse, was listed on Gilt City. “I’ve been in Town & Country and Vogue, and neither of them gave me the visibility that Gilt did,” said Ms. Rose, who sold 100 diet packages for $250 instead of the usual $425.Oscar Blandi, a Madison Avenue hairstylist, offered a highlight and blowout package ($145, down from $275) at his salon on Gilt City last December as part of what he called a marketing strategy to help his junior stylists and colorists build their business. “This gets them in the door,” he said. “It’s up to me to cultivate the client.”But merchants like Ms. Rose and Mr. Blandi are looking for more than just exposure. More crucial to them is that customers return, and pay full price.“You kind of take it as a loss leader because you hope people have a positive experience and translate into a lifelong patient,” said Dr. Jennifer Jablow, a cosmetic dentist in New York who sold 50 cleanings and 63 whitening treatments on Gilt City this year. So far, 13 of those new patients have returned for additional services at regular cost.But at what point does a business risk devaluing itself in the name of finding a few new customers? Dr. Steven Pearlman, a facial plastic surgeon who listed discounted prices for chemical peels, laser services, Botox and Juvederm on Gilt City last year, said he would not work with a deal site again for a very long time.“I don’t want to undercut patients who have been seeing me for years and paying full price, the majority of whom do,” Dr. Pearlman said. “I don’t want to cheapen the brand.”Indeed, some beauty professionals have decided to sit the trend out. Sharon Dorram, a hair colorist, said she did not need to offer her services at a discount.“These discount Web sites are best for businesses that are falling under the radar, or lagging in ‘word of mouth,’ ” Ms. Dorram wrote in an e-mail. Isabelle Bellis, a New York-based aesthetician with a celebrity following, said she would never consider discounting her prices. “I think I am totally fair,” she said.But it seems clear that these sites have begat a new breed of beauty bargain hunter.“I’d be silly to spend all the money I did in the past when I know I can get it at such a discount,” said Janna Schneider, 37, a program consultant for a private tutoring company in New York. Ms. Schneider estimates she has saved well over $500 by booking two keratin treatments and a package for 10 Zumba fitness classes through Lifebooker and Gilt City, respectively.Ms. Fisher, the Coach sales associate, said: “Now going to the salon is like getting on an airplane. You don’t know what someone in the seat next to you is paying.”'"

"'11-04-15,'1','Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, suggested on Thursday night that he would run for mayor of New York City in 2013 if his longtime nemesis, former Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer, entered the race and the city’s police commissioner sat it out.It was the first time that Mr. Grasso publicly addressed his interest in becoming a candidate, though the possibility that he might has been rumored in city political circles for months.Mr. Grasso told a crowd at Wagner College on Staten Island that he would relish the chance to take on Mr. Spitzer, who as attorney general in 2004 sued to try to recover much of Mr. Grasso’s $140 million in compensation from the stock exchange. That sum embroiled Mr. Grasso in a drawn-out controversy that eventually became a public feud with Mr. Spitzer, now a CNN host.But Mr. Grasso was emphatic about not challenging Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, who he has said possesses the skills and résumé to be mayor.“If the man who really should be the mayor, the next mayor of the city of New York, the great police commissioner Ray Kelly, chooses not to run, and if my former adversary does run as an independent in 2013, I will run for mayor of the City of New York,” he said to loud applause. Wagner’s media relations director, Lee Manchester, who attended the speech, called it a “conditional declaration.” While Mr. Grasso could not be reached for comment, it does not appear he has taken any additional steps to prepare for a campaign.The field of Democrats likely to weigh a run for mayor is crowded: the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn; Comptroller John C. Liu; the public advocate, Bill de Blasio; and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer. Mr. Grasso would probably run as a Republican or an independent.'"

"'11-04-15,'1','Cloud computing, though, is more than a hyper-efficient means of distributing digital services. The cloud model is animated by a set of Internet technologies for juggling computing workloads in data centers far more efficiently than in the past — potentially reducing costs by about half, analysts say.Yet to date, the large, established technology companies — and their businesses and government customers — have trailed in cloud computing. The marketing of the cloud, analysts say, is way ahead of real offerings by suppliers and its adoption by business customers.But there are some recent signs of change. Last week, I.B.M. introduced a range of cloud services, including paying for computing resources like processing and storage on a metered pay-for-use formula, almost as if modeled on an electric utility. I.B.M. will offer customers an à la carte menu, in which they pay for different levels of guaranteed security, support and availability.I.B.M., a bellwether in the corporate technology market, forecasts that it will have $7 billion in cloud revenue by 2015. Of the total, $4 billion will be customers shifting to cloud delivery from the company’s traditional software and services, and $3 billion is expected to be entirely new business.“We’re moving to where the puck is going in this industry,” said Steven A. Mills, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for software and hardware. “And we’re more than willing to make this transition.”In another industry move announced last week, Dell said that it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand customer support, largely for cloud offerings.The largest single customer for computing goods and services, the United States government, endorsed the cloud model this year. Vivek Kundra, the White House chief information officer, wrote a “Federal Cloud Computing Strategy” report, and identified $20 billion, or one quarter of the government’s total spending on information technology, as “a potential target” for migration to the cloud.That document has certainly caught the attention of the government’s technology suppliers, like Lockheed Martin, the largest. “We’re keenly focused on cloud computing,” said Melvin Greer, a senior fellow at Lockheed Martin.Still, the outlook is for an evolutionary shift toward the new technology spanning several years, even a decade or more, analysts say. People set the pace of technology adoption, and corporate data centers are filled with people whose skills and livelihoods are based on older technology and ways of doing things.But technology managers, surveys show, are also genuinely concerned about security, reliability and liability if confidential corporate data resides on another company’s computers — and getting locked into proprietary clouds, controlled by one company. Standards groups are moving to set technical rules for sharing data across different clouds, including a working group established last week by the IEEE, a professional electronic and computer engineering organization.“Cloud computing will become the new foundation for corporate information technology — it’s inevitable,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC, a technology research firm. “But there are a lot of concerns, challenges and inertia that will slow things down.”There are also insurgents, like Amazon, that could speed things up in corporate cloud computing. Five years ago, the online bookseller and retailer decided to start a side business, offering computing resources to businesses from its network of sophisticated data centers. It called the new unit Amazon Web Services. It is a pay-for-use utility model, with customers paying from pennies to millions of dollars a month, says Adam Selipsky, vice president for product management.Today, the customer ranks include Netflix, NASA, drug companies and major banks, which use Amazon’s data centers to remotely run Web applications that do tasks like tracking customer movie requests or running credit-risk simulations.The Amazon cloud strategy, Mr. Selipsky says, mirrors its tactics in online retailing: build scale and efficiency, then cut costs and prices to gain market share. Amazon Web Services, he said, has reduced prices a dozen times in the last three years. “Most of that has been in the absence of competition,” Mr. Selipsky said, “because competitors have been so slow to emerge.”Yet competition in the cloud market is intensifying. And that competition is taking shape across a number of fronts. It includes vendors offering basic computing resources like Amazon and Rackspace, joined by telecommunications giants like AT&T and Verizon that have entered the cloud business; companies offering ready-to-use applications tailored for businesses like Google’s online e-mail, document and collaboration services; Microsoft’s online version of its Office and collaboration tools; and Salesforce.com’s online customer management and collaboration tools.Several companies also have built development environments on which programmers can build cloud software applications. Google has App Engine, Amazon has BeanStalk, Microsoft has Azure, Salesforce.com has Force.com, and VMware has Cloud Foundry, which was introduced on Tuesday. By 2014, IDC estimates that 30 percent of total spending on software applications in the corporate market will be for cloud applications.Revenue from business cloud services — infrastructure resources, software applications and developer tools — was $22.2 billion last year, less than 2 percent of total technology spending, IDC estimates. But cloud revenue is growing at more than 25 percent a year, and will reach $55.5 billion by 2014, the research firm estimates.Salesforce.com, founded in 1999, began selling customer-relationship software to businesses as an Internet service long before the industry began talking of cloud computing. Things built slowly at first, but Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, says the turning point has come.“What’s being called the cloud now is the future of enterprise software, but when I started in 1999 no one believed that,” said Mr. Benioff, who recently raised the company’s revenue forecast by 25 percent. “Sometimes you do have to wait them out.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','In the case of the stolen tomatoes, the thieves seemed deeply versed in the ways of trucking companies and the produce industry. Transportation company executives and a law enforcement official said the criminals appeared to have set up a bogus trucking company with the intention of stealing loads of produce and other goods.The company, based in , was called E&A Transport Express, according to Master Cpl. David M. Vincent of the Florida Highway Patrol’s cargo theft task force. The company registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in late February, according to the agency’s online database. That was right around the time produce prices were soaring.“They were just sitting and waiting, watching the produce because they knew it was climbing,” said Clifford Holland, the owner of the transportation brokerage firm Old North State, which was a victim of the gang. “It was like a snake in the grass and they struck.”In the produce industry, buyers and sellers typically use freight brokers as middlemen to hire the trucking companies that carry goods from place to place.The thieves apparently began watching Web sites where brokers posted notices trying to connect trucking companies with loads they need carried.In late March, they contacted Allen Lund. The broker carried out a standard series of checks, including verifying the company’s federal registration and its insurance coverage. Then it assigned the company to pick up a load of tomatoes from a shipper in Miami on Monday, March 28.Over the next four days, working through Lund and three other freight brokers, E&A Transport picked up four more loads of tomatoes, a load of cucumbers and a load of frozen meat from shippers across Florida, including in the Miami area, Palmetto and Punta Gorda.At each pick-up, a driver working for E&A showed up at the wheel of a tractor with a refrigerated trailer. The shippers loaded the pallets of tomatoes or the other goods into the trucks and the driver drove off. None of the loads got to their destinations.The load of frozen meat, worth about $48,000, was picked up from a meatpacker north of Miami. It was bound for Salem, Ore. It is missing, too.“This was definitely a smart organization,” said Mr. Holland, who was the broker on the load of meat. “They were smooth as silk.”The thieves sought out loads headed for , , the Hunts Point market in New York, and . Mr. Holland said that gave them time to carry out multiple thefts before the alarm was sounded, since in each case it would be from two to four days before the loads were due at their destinations. Brokers and shippers suspect the thieves had a buyer for the produce.Tomato growers said that there had been occasional thefts in the past when prices were high, but the sophistication of this trucking ring was something new.“We’ve never seen anything like this,” said Bob Spencer, an owner of West Coast Tomato in Palmetto, Fla., which lost a load of about 40,000 pounds of tomatoes that he said was worth about $42,000.Interviews with several police departments in Florida revealed an investigation that might be lacking coordination.The thieves appear to have benefited by stealing loads in several jurisdictions, with the result that some police departments were slow to share information about the crimes.The Florida Highway Patrol said the cargo theft unit of the Miami Dade Police Department was leading the investigation. But Detective Roy Rutland, a spokesman for the Miami Dade police, initially denied that the department was aware of the thefts. He later said the department had been asked to assist in the investigation, but that it was not taking a lead role.“We’re trying to figure out who’s handling this,” Mr. Rutland said on Wednesday. “We just learned that most of this occurred outside of our jurisdiction.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','“A lot of moms have a hard time even talking to their own peers about this issue and have to get over their own embarrassment so they can have a candid, fun and supportive conversation with their daughters,” Dr. Rankin said in a phone interview.On another area of the site, intended for prospective users, UbyKotex.com/HelloPeriod, visitors share videos and written accounts of their first periods. One out of three females has no idea what is happening when her first period arrives, while four out of five mothers feel ill-prepared to educate their daughters about menstruation, according to surveys commissioned by Kotex.The sites for both mothers and their daughters are by Organic, part of the Omnicom Group.Susan Kim, co-author of “Flow: The Cultural Story of Menstruation,” was initially startled by the introduction of U by Kotex Tween.“What punched me in the gut is that the age of menarche had dropped so precipitously,” said Ms. Kim, using the term for first menstruation. “My first reaction was, ‘Oh my gosh, a period kit for an 8-year-old — eek!’ ”But she does not dispute the need for products that cater to girls that young, and lauded the brand’s approach.“It was not that long ago that girls used to pass around the Judy Blume book, ‘Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,’ ” because it addressed stigmatized topics including menstruation, Ms. Kim said. “It was such contraband material, so I liked that on the preteen site that it very much was a place for girls to share, with firsthand testimony.”From 1920 to 1984, the average age of menarche dropped from 13.3 to 12.4, according to a 2007 article in the Journal of Adolescent Health. A study published in Pediatrics last year found that in the United States, 15 percent of American girls begin puberty by age 7.The U by Kotex line was introduced in 2010 with a marketing campaign aimed at women 14 to 22 that skewers feminine care companies, including Kotex itself, for the typically euphemistic tone and dainty tropes of their ads.“The ads on TV are really helpful because they use that blue liquid,” says a woman in her early 20s in the first U by Kotex commercial, as blue liquid is poured on a pad. “And I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s what’s supposed to happen.’ ”The commercial, by JWT, which is a part of WPP, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times on YouTube.With the motto “Break the Cycle,” the brand uses humor to challenge the stigma around menstrual products in Web-only videos, also by Organic, including one in which a woman standing with her bike outside a drugstore asks men to go in and buy her tampons because she forgot her bike lock. While some offer to watch her bike, none will make the purchase.Over the 52 weeks that ended March 20, the share of all Kotex products in the $634 million tampon category increased 4.1 points, for a 15.9 percent share, while in the $893 million sanitary napkins and liners segment, the brand increased 1.7 points, for a 19.4 percent share, according to Symphony/IRI Group, a market data firm whose totals do not include Wal-Mart.U by Kotex spent $23.2 million on advertising in 2010, eclipsing the $4.1 million Kimberly-Clark spent on the older Kotex brand, according to the Kantar Media Unit of WPP. Tampax, by Procter & Gamble, which dominates the tampon segment with a 47.2 percent share, spent $49.9 million.U by Kotex recently began addressing the look of feminine care products, which have traditionally been plain white, by printing various designs on pads. With what the brand calls a “limited-edition designer series,” prints like “poptimistic” and “punk glam,” will be introduced for U by Kotex products in July.Meanwhile, an online pad design contest, Ban the Bland, began April 4 and has drawn more than 1,600 submissions. Three contestants with the most online votes will be flown in September to New York, where they will collaborate with Patricia Field, the costume designer for “Sex and the City.”“Why should we settle for feminine care being dull and white and boring?” said Ms. Sexton about the designs on both the U by Kotex and U by Kotex Tween pads. “Every day when we get dressed, we have a choice of what we wear, and when we have our periods we should still have that choice.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Portugal needs international help to meet its debt obligations. But the insistence by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that the caretaker Portuguese government commit to a long-term plan of fiscal austerity and economic reform in exchange for a rescue package is misguided.The government of Prime Minister José Sócrates fell in March after the opposition rejected its austerity plan to address the economic crisis and is holding on to office only until special elections, which are scheduled for June 5. Not only would any reform package from the outgoing government lack legitimacy, it would lack credibility with investors, who would suspect the next government might not live up to what will inevitably be very painful terms.Rather than try to hammer out a definitive package, the European Union and the I.M.F. should give Portugal a bridge loan and wait to negotiate a deal until there is a new government in place. This would give Portuguese voters a chance to vote on proposals by each party to address the emergency.In the meantime, Europe needs to rethink its all-pain-all-the-time approach to bailouts. The terms imposed on Greece and Ireland are stifling growth. On Wednesday, Germany acknowledged Greece may have to restructure its debts — rather than pay them in full.Representatives from the European Union and the I.M.F. landed in Lisbon on Tuesday to negotiate a bailout plan expected to be worth $115 billion. The formula, by now, is predictable: deep budget cuts, cuts to public-sector wages and tax increases. They are also likely to demand that Portugal privatize state-run enterprises and reform labor laws to make it cheaper to hire and fire workers.The approach assumes sharp fiscal tightening will right Portugal’s finances, ignoring how a precipitous drop in government spending will cripple growth and Portugal’s ability to repay its debts. And it is unjust, demanding outsize, lasting sacrifices from the Portuguese people in order to repay Portugal’s creditors 100 cents on the euro.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','The renewed feuding highlights the shaky foundations of a government, just 20 months into power, that has struggled in its response to Japan’s worst disaster in many decades. Mr. Kan’s Democratic Party came to power in August 2009 with much fanfare, sweeping aside a Liberal Democratic party that had governed Japan nearly uninterrupted for more than a half-century. But the Democrats’ relative inexperience has become a liability, especially since the earthquake and tsunami.The political infighting also raises fears that Japan will be left rudderless even as it embarks on the huge task of reconstruction. And it could prolong political paralysis in a country that has already produced five prime ministers in five years, weak leaders from both of the major parties.In another development, the police moved their search for bodies closer to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors on Thursday, while workers continued to remove radioactive water from the plant. Until now, rescuers had largely stayed out of a 12-mile evacuation zone around the power station.Police officials said that radiation levels had dropped enough to allow workers to safely comb the area closer to the plant for victims of the earthquake and tsunami.Mr. Kan was already in political trouble before the disaster, weighed down by a gridlocked Parliament that had blocked important budget bills and by accusations that he had accepted political donations from a foreigner in violation of local laws. Mr. Kan has said he did not know that the donor was a foreigner.Opposition lawmakers were in fact grilling Mr. Kan over the donation allegations when the earthquake struck, forcing a suspension of the Parliament session. Eager to avoid any semblance of political maneuvering at a time of crisis, opposition parties initially rallied around the leader.Mr. Kan’s popularity was at first buoyed somewhat in the aftermath, but it now appears to be sliding. He has increasingly avoided the public over the past month, appearing at only a handful of news conferences.In local elections last week, the Democrats lost two races for governor to candidates backed by the Liberal Democratic Party, while the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, an independent allied with the Liberal Democrats, was re-elected to a fourth term. In prefectural assembly elections, the Democrats won 346 seats, compared with the Liberal Democrats’ 1,119.“Can a government that has lost public support really handle a national crisis?” Nobuteru Ishihara, the Liberal Democrats’ No. 2 official and the Tokyo governor’s son, said on NHK, the public broadcaster, after the elections.On Tuesday, Mr. Kan defended his response to the crisis. “In this disaster, my priority lies in saving lives,” he said at a news conference. “I believe I have built a strong team and that we have deployed everything in our power.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','The school system has its own budget and taxing authority but has been intertwined with the mayor’s office since Mr. Daley seized control of the district in 1995. Like all schools chiefs since then, Mr. Mazany is a mayoral appointee.Mr. Emanuel has not yet indicated whom he will name as the schools’ chief executive or as members of the Board of Education, which governs the district and sets its tax rate.Mr. Mazany agreed in November to lead the district temporarily after Ron Huberman stepped down from the job following Mr. Daley’s announcement that he would not seek another term as mayor. Mr. Mazany has said that a priority will be addressing the district’s budget shortfall.Mr. Mazany did not reply to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the district, Monique Bond, said the district had not made a formal proposal to the Board of Education, which must approve a budget by August.“The budget process is a very fluid process,” Ms. Bond said, “and the numbers will fluctuate.”Tarrah Cooper, a spokeswoman for Mr. Emanuel, e-mailed a statement saying, “C.P.S.’s new leadership will review the department’s financial situation and will re-evaluate the budget to see how we can best serve Chicago’s children.”Addressing taxes in his victory speech in February, Mr. Emanuel said, “We need to confront the budget deficit that threatens our future, not by burdening Chicagoans and Chicago families with more taxes they cannot afford, but by reinventing city government so city government works for the taxpayers.”After Mr. Emanuel is sworn in on May 16, the Board of Education will have 30 days to vote on whether the district can afford the 4 percent salary increase.  If it were to reject the increase, the union would have the right to strike, though a bill introduced in Springfield this week would require support from  75 percent of membership before any walkout.The district estimated that a property tax increase would bring in almost enough money to pay for the teachers’ wage increase, which is projected to cost $100 million, according to the documents shared between Chicago Public Schools, the mayor’s office and Mr. Emanuel’s team.Jackson Potter, chief of staff to the Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, said the union would prefer that the district not raise taxes. “We’d be against it, because what ends up happening is all the residents of the city of Chicago are told: you’ll have to pay through the nose,” he said. Using money from the city’s tax-increment financing districts might help, Mr. Potter added.Laurence Msall, the president of the Civic Federation, a budget policy group that analyzes the district’s budgets, said Chicago Public Schools already received more than half the money collected in property taxes.Mr. Mazany needs to show that the district has taken other measures to trim the deficit before asking taxpayers for help, Mr. Msall said. “He’s going to have to present evidence that they have done everything necessary to balance the budget and that as a last resort, they’re raising the property tax,” he said.On the contractual wage increase for teachers, Mr. Msall said, “At a time of great financial distress for the city and all the surrounding governments, everything has to be on the table.”The school district has increased its levy eight times in the last decade. As a cost-saving measure, Mr. Mazany last month proposed closing eight schools and phasing out another. But the district backed off closing two of those schools after parents and elected officials objected.Much of the schools’ deficit arises because the district has not been able to replace federal stimulus money that helped it meet its budget last year. The state also owes Chicago Public Schools $291 million in back payments, Ms. Bond said.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Packages priced at $5,000, $10,000 and $25,000 are also available, according to a fund-raising flier.The contributions will pay for all of the festivities, and taxpayer money will not be used, aides to Mr. Emanuel said.In the flier, the committee said it would not accept contributions from City Hall lobbyists or from anyone who had “done over $10,000 of business within any 12 consecutive months during the preceding four years” with the city or any of its sister agencies, including the Chicago Board of Education and the Chicago Transit Authority.The inauguration reception will be at Venue 1, on the near West Side, on the same day as the concert. The dinner will also take place on May 14, but the flier did not say where.The inauguration committee has not yet announced where the swearing-in ceremony will take place. For his sixth and final term, Mayor Richard M. Daley, who is retiring after 22 years, was sworn in the City Council chamber, on the second floor at City Hall.Mr. Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff and Daley campaign fund-raiser, collected more than $12 million in campaign contributions on his way to winning the Feb. 22 election with 55 percent of the vote.Mayor Richard M. Daley’s administration has resisted disciplining many high-ranking city officials implicated in patronage hiring at City Hall, the federal hiring monitor said in court documents filed recently.The court-appointed monitor, Noelle Brennan, wants a federal judge to grant her the power to investigate and recommend disciplinary measures against administration officials said to have been involved in rigging city hiring to favor politically connected job applicants.Lawyers for the Daley administration have opposed the proposed court order.As of March 31, the city had paid Ms. Brennan more than $5 million, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Law Department said.Ms. Brennan was appointed in 2005 after federal authorities raided Mr. Daley’s office in an investigation that led to corruption convictions of several mayoral aides, including Robert A. Sorich, the former patronage chief, and Al Sanchez, the former Streets and Sanitation Department commissioner.In the past five years, Ms. Brennan has asked the city to investigate and possibly discipline more than 20 officials who were identified during the Sorich and Sanchez trials as participants in the hiring fraud, according to court records. She says that the Daley administration has been unwilling to punish offenders, and that it even promoted one aide who admitted involvement in fraudulent hiring to a cabinet-level position.“Since the Sorich trial, city employees have frequently called the monitor’s office to voice frustration and incredulity that employees who were directly implicated in the unlawful patronage practices were never reprimanded by the city,” Ms. Brennan wrote in the court documents.“Some of the complainants continue to be supervised by the same supervisors who passed them over for promotions in favor of politically clouted and less qualified candidates,” she added.Court testimony showed that the Daley administration secretly violated civil consent decrees restricting patronage for more than a decade, fueling a political machine that was deployed during election campaigns for the mayor and his allies. Michael Shakman, the lawyer who has fought for those measures for decades, said he supported Ms. Brennan’s request.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Before jumping on the natural gas bandwagon, Mr. Nocera might have consulted his colleagues. On the same day, there was an article in the business section about natural gas called “Poking Holes in a Green Image.”Mr. Nocera breezily claims that natural gas is cleaner than oil. Cleaner when burned, yes, but that’s just part of the story. As the other article says, new studies suggest that releases of unburned natural gas in production and distribution may pour enough methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere to more than offset the natural gas clean-burning advantage.Joe Nocera tells us that “of course, you can’t use solar or wind to power a vehicle, which is what most imported oil is used for.” On the contrary, we can use either solar or wind to power vehicles. Plug-in electric cars run on electricity from the grid, and that electricity can come from solar or wind generators.Another possibility comes from hydrogen as fuel. A “hydrogen economy” has been a longtime dream. Now comes Daniel G. Nocera (who is not related to Joe Nocera) and his group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with their dramatic improvements in the use of solar energy to split water into its components, making hydrogen fuel cells a realistic option for powering vehicles.Bio-based fuels are produced through photosynthesis. While corn-based ethanol is not a very good idea, other biofuels will doubtless play significant roles in transportation.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Association-initiated foreclosures are still a small fraction of the overall total in the Bay Area and elsewhere. But advocates for housing rights said the problem ran much deeper, as associations used the threat of foreclosure to intensify pressure on troubled homeowners. The associations often work with debt collectors who add fees and collection costs, causing the debt to skyrocket.“People come up with money through a painful process; their home is being held hostage and the debt collector knows it,” said Marjorie Murray, who directs the Center for California Homeowner Association Law, an Oakland advocacy group.Last week, the California Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill to curtail predatory practices by collection agencies that can lead to ballooning debt and foreclosure proceedings. It would close a loophole that enables collection agencies to apply payments to their own fees and collection costs before paying down the original debt to homeowners associations. Current law forbids this, but debt collectors exploit vagueness in it to get homeowners to waive their rights.Senator Ellen M. Corbett, Democrat of San Leandro, who co-sponsored the bill with the Center for California Homeowner Association Law, said the legislation was designed to give struggling homeowners a chance to catch up on payments to homeowners associations.“Unscrupulous debt collectors are increasing the amount owed based on penalties and fees, and foreclosing on people’s homes,” Ms. Corbett said in an interview. “It’s a terrible practice. The penalties are just way too harsh.”But Bay Area homeowners associations say they are feeling the same squeeze as the homeowners. Ken Johnson, president of the Eden Shores Homeowners Association in Hayward, said most homeowner associations were run by volunteers, who have neither the time nor the expertise to chase down delinquent homeowners.Mr. Johnson said roughly half of his development’s 500 tract homes are in some stage of foreclosure, primarily because of mortgage defaults. Many of those homeowners are also delinquent on their assessments, he said. That means Eden Shores has less money to provide services, including maintenance of common areas like streets, swimming pools and parks.Mr. Johnson said associations were not interested in taking over distressed properties. “They don’t want to be liable for it; they just want the funds,” he said.Andrew Fortin, a spokesman for the Community Associations Institute, an organization that supports homeowners associations nationwide, said the ability to collect dues was essential to ensure that associations were able to provide crucial services.“You can understand why an association would want to be on top of collecting assessments, or everyone’s property value becomes zero,” Mr. Fortin said.For homeowners, however, that process can be painful.Ms. Bryant said she got into trouble when her bookkeeping assignments started to dwindle in the depressed economy. She began to pay her assessments every other month and fell two months behind. She said she had no idea her home was at risk until she received a notice from a collection agency.By then, the agency, Association Lien Services, had applied an additional $1,000 in fees, documents show. To stave off foreclosure, Ms. Bryant said, she was desperate to work out a payment plan, but the agency’s offer required her to sign an agreement to allow her payments to go toward collection costs before being applied to her delinquent dues, circumventing a state law requiring that payments go toward the original debt before being applied to fees.Instead of signing the document, Ms. Bryant obtained a pro bono lawyer. She recently paid the full amount she owed the association and worked out a deal to pay a fifth of the nearly $2,500 in collection costs.Jane Fay, president of the Parkview Heights Homeowners Association, said that she sympathized with Ms. Bryant but that she believed the board acted responsibly in trying to collect the overdue assessments.She did not agree with all of her debt collector’s practices, Ms. Fay said, but homeowners associations have few options besides pursuing the debt. Delinquents must shoulder part of the blame, she said.“You’re an adult,” she said. “You haven’t paid, and you know you haven’t paid. There are repercussions.”Ms. Fay said she was named president of the association in the middle of Ms. Bryant’s dispute and did not have enough information to know “right or wrong.” She said the association waived some late charges and interest.“We don’t want the association to be making money off of homeowners who are in dire financial straits,” Ms. Fay said.For collection agencies, however, the foreclosure process can be profitable.David Swedelson is a partner in Swedelson & Gottlieb, a Southern California law firm that is an affiliate of Association Lien Services. Mr. Swedelson said homeowners associations contracted with collection agencies because the latter could cut through “government red tape and requirements” and resolve cases “a lot faster.”Mr. Swedelson’s law firm boasts on its Web site that it can collect delinquent assessments, costs and fees in “90 percent of cases,” and said it believed that “foreclosure is the fastest and most effective way to collect overdue assessments.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Borrowing short and lending long is the essence of banking. But the business model has some serious flaws when big banks dive too deeply into short-term debt, as they did before the 2008 financial crisis. Bad habits have not yet returned, but recent data indicates some banks may be flirting with temptation.Banks, in the United States and Britain in particular, have made serious headway in reducing their reliance on debt markets in the last two years. They have also worked to stretch out the time they have to pay back creditors. Moody’s calls the progress significant, with debt profiles heading back toward a more normal six to seven years rather than the alarming 4.7 years on average globally in 2009.Banks will still need to roll over or pay back $3.6 trillion over the next two years, however, according to the I.M.F. As long as credit markets remain on cruise control this shouldn’t be a problem. Even if turbulence strikes, United States banks, for example, count on a fat cushion of deposits to soften the blow.But quiescent capital markets may be emboldening a creep back into shorter-term debt. In the first three months of this year, a third of the $51 billion borrowed by America’s biggest, and systemically important, banks in the corporate debt market matured in three years or less, according to Thomson Reuters, up from 15 percent a year ago. Commercial paper borrowing is also on the rise, up 11 percent in 2011.Some of the change could be the result of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s efforts to curb borrowing in the repo market, where financing can be as short as one day. Maturing bonds issued during the crisis, and guaranteed by the F.D.I.C., could also be causing a spike as banks refinance them with bonds of maturities below three years.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','In the analysts’ eyes, Google’s spending played a big role in the stumble on Thursday. The company had gone on a hiring spree — it added nearly 1,900 new workers during the quarter — and made good on a previous promise to give all its employees a 10 percent raise. Operating costs including salaries were $2.84 billion in the first quarter, up 55 percent from a year earlier.Asked repeatedly about the spending in a call with analysts, the Google executives who did stick around stressed that the hiring was necessary to help build emerging products like mobile and YouTube that will pay off in the long run. Patrick Pichette, Google’s chief financial officer, emphasized that Google was disciplined and that all units had to justify their costs.“Everybody that has a cost center has to demonstrate productivity,” he said.That response got a cool reception from analysts. “They can’t continue to invest at this rate because the law of diminishing returns will kick in at some point,” said Ross Sandler, an analyst with RBS Capital Markets.The big question before the call was whether Mr. Page would speak. He is not particularly talkative and, previously, while co-president, often missed such meetings with the analysts. Mr. Pichette described Mr. Page’s appearance as “a surprise,” signaling that he will likely be an infrequent participant in the future.Mr. Gillis, BGC Financial analyst, said that Mr. Page should have made more of an effort. “The reality of running a public company is that that are some of obligations of outreach to the financial community and shareholders,” Mr. Gillis said. “The concern is that he is going to run the company without concern for shareholders and there was nothing here to placate that.”Mr. Page led Google after co-founding the company in 1998 with Sergey Brin, but then gave up the reins three years later to Eric E. Schmidt, a more experienced technology executive who was hired to balance the offbeat founders who stayed very involved in decision making.Under Mr. Schmidt, Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., thrived. But with the growth came increasingly slow decision making and a feeling inside the company that other companies, notably Facebook, were perhaps innovating more quickly.Mr. Page is determined to push back the bureaucracy. During his short tenure, he has already reorganized top management to increase “velocity,” as he put it on Thursday, and revamped the employee bonus program to reward workers for the company’s success with social networking products.Google executives are concerned about the rise of Facebook. Executives promised more social features from Google, particularly using cues from its users’ behavior to personalize their results.Google’s first-quarter earnings are the first reported with Mr. Page at the helm. However, they reflect the company’s performance for the first three months of the year, when Mr. Schmidt, was still in charge. Mr. Schmidt is now the company’s chairman.Google reported that net income in the quarter rose 17 percent to $2.3 billion, or $7.04 cents a share, from $1.96 billion, or $6.06 a share in the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue climbed to $8.58 billion from $6.77 billion.Google’s adjusted income of $8.08 was just below the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had forecast $8.11 cents a share on that basis, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Revenue excluding payments to partner Web sites, a measure commonly used by analysts following the company, was $6.54 billion, Google said. Analysts had expected $6.32 billion in revenue on that basis.Paid clicks, the number of times users clicked on ads on Google and those of its partner sites, increased 18 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier, Google said. The price advertisers paid for Google’s ads grew 8 percent.Online advertising is by far Google’s biggest business, but the company is pushing into advertising on mobile phones where people are spending an increasing amount of time.Google said on Thursday that 350,000 mobile devices using its Android operating system were activated daily. Android led all other mobile operating systems with 33 percent of the phone market in the United States for the three months ending in February, according to comScore’s MobiLens report. Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, had a 28.9 percent share, while Apple’s share was 25.2 percent.Mr. Pichette indicated that Google would remain a technology company looking for new users and “billion dollar businesses.”The company’s position has not changed,” Mr. Pichette said.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Uncle Mo has a gastrointestinal infection and may not run in the Kentucky Derby on May 7. The colt was the undefeated 2-year-old champion and the prohibitive 1-to-10 favorite in Saturday’s Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, but he ran poorly and finished third behind Toby’s Corner and Arthur’s Tale.On Tuesday, the infection was discovered after a number of tests, according to his trainer, Todd Pletcher. Uncle Mo was immediately treated with medicine. Veterinarians told Pletcher and Uncle Mo’s owner, Mike Repole, that the colt could continue full training.“He will ship to Churchill Downs on April 18 and will have two works before May 7,” Pletcher said in a statement. “If I do not feel that Uncle Mo is 100 percent for the Kentucky Derby, both Mike and I agree that he will not run. My main focus is to return Uncle Mo to optimum health in the next 23 days, and I am optimistic that we can accomplish this goal.”Repole acknowledged that it was his “lifelong dream to run and win the Kentucky Derby,” but said that if Uncle Mo was not sound, he would skip the Derby and go right to the Preakness on May 21 at Pimlico.“I am relieved that the vets were able to find a reason why we got a disappointing performance from Uncle Mo in the Wood Memorial,” he said. “I, like all racing fans, hope that Uncle Mo will be 100 percent on May 7 and in the starting gate at Churchill Downs.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','There have been many undesirable repercussions of China’s unrelenting real estate boom, which has driven prices up by 140 percent nationwide since 2007, and by as much as 800 percent in Beijing over the past eight years. Working-class buyers have been frozen out of the market while an estimated 65 million apartments across the country bought as speculative investments sit empty.The frenzy starts with the local governments that sell off land at steep prices, and is frothed up by overeager developers who force residents out of old neighborhoods, sometimes prompting self-immolations among the dispossessed. But largely overlooked is the collateral damage to urban young professionals, especially men, who increasingly find themselves lovelorn and despairing as a growing number of women hold out for a mate with a deed.Although there are few concrete ways to measure the scope of involuntary bachelorhood, more than 70 percent of single women in a recent survey said they would tie the knot only with a prospective husband who owned a home.Among the qualities they seek in a mate, 50 percent said that financial considerations ranked above all else, with good morals and personality falling beneath the top three requirements. (Not surprisingly, 54 percent of single men ranked beauty first, according to the report, which surveyed 32,000 people and was jointly issued by the Chinese Research Association of Marriage and Family and the All-China Women’s Federation.)The marriage competition is fierce, and statistically, women hold the cards. Given the nation’s gender imbalance, an outgrowth of a cultural preference for boys and China’s stringent family-planning policies, as many as 24 million men could be perpetual bachelors by 2020, according to the report.Zhang Yanhong, a matchmaking consultant at Baihe, one of the country’s most popular dating sites, said many disheartened men had simply dropped out of the marriage market.“This fixation on real estate has twisted the popular notion of love and marriage,” she said. “Women are putting economic factors above everything else when looking for a mate, and this is not a good thing for relationships or for society.”The nation’s real-estate obsession is especially noteworthy given China’s relatively recent embrace of home ownership.The sale of residential property was not allowed until the late 1980s, and even then under a leasehold system that gives buyers 70 years of ownership. Today, about two-thirds of all Chinese under 40 own their own homes, slightly higher than the average for Americans of the same age group.With few other outlets for investment (those who park their money in a Chinese bank effectively lose money, given low interest rates and high inflation), many families have been plowing their savings into apartments, spurring what some economists describe as a bubble.Han Han, one of China’s most widely read bloggers, frequently assails the government policies that he and many economists say have contributed to rapidly rising prices.In an interview, he said one consequence of the single-minded focus on real estate, or on earning the money to make mortgage payments and repay family loans, is that young people have little time for anything else. “We’ve created a generation of young people whose sole ambition is to have a piece of property under their name,” he said.Like many anxious bachelors, Yang Xuning, 29, a sportswriter from Beijing, said much of the pressure comes from parents who feel taunted by the wealth around them.He recalls his first meeting with his girlfriend’s parents in Shanghai last winter, when he was asked about his salary and his nesting plans. “I tried to reason with her mother, explaining that it’s not practical to buy something at this stage in our lives but she wouldn’t hear it,” he said.He stood his ground, she stood hers, and a few months later, on the second anniversary of their relationship, Mr. Yang’s girlfriend called it quits.“A lot of girls, encouraged by their parents, see marriage as a way of instantly changing their status without the hard work,” he said bitterly.Many women are unapologetic about their priorities, citing the age-old tradition in which men provided a home for their brides, even if that home came with a mother-in-law.There are also other concerns, including the instability of starting a family in rented premises and the endless badgering of parents.Status also plays a role, but so, too, do fears that those who put off buying will be priced out of the market indefinitely.Gao Yanan, a 27-year-old accountant with a fondness for Ray-Bans and Zara pantsuits, said the matter was not up for debate. “It’s the guy’s responsibility to tell a girl right away whether he owns an apartment,” she said. “It gives her a chance not to fall in love.”With such women on the prowl, even men who do have their own homes have come up with techniques to weed out the covetous and the inordinately materialistic.Liu Binbin, 30, an editor at a publishing house in Beijing, said he often arrived at first dates by bus, even though he owned a car. “If they ask me questions like ‘Do you live with your parents?’ I know what they’re after,” he said.Mr. Liu said he went on 20 unfulfilling blind dates until finding a suitable girlfriend last year. He said he knew she was the one after passing the three-month mark.“The whole time she thought I didn’t own an apartment and she still wanted me,” he said. “Someone like that is rare.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','Producer prices rose 0.7 percent in March, propelled by higher energy costs, in the third consecutive monthly increase of prices before they reach the consumer.The Labor Department said in its monthly report that the Producer Price Index was up 0.7 percent in March, compared with increases of 1.6 percent in February and 0.8 percent in January. Analysts had forecast an increase of 1 percent.The index offered a hint of higher inflation in the months ahead as those costs are passed to consumers. March’s Consumer Price Index, which will be released Friday, is expected to rise 0.5 percent, while the core index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to climb 0.2 percent.Nearly 90 percent of the increase in producer prices in March can be traced to the 2.6 percent climb in energy prices, mostly for gasoline, the department’s report said. It was the sixth consecutive monthly increase in energy prices, with gasoline prices alone rising 5.7 percent. Food prices declined 0.2 percent, a reversal from a 3.9 percent gain in February.Without volatile food and energy prices, the core index edged up 0.3 percent, the government report showed, slightly above analysts’ forecasts of 0.2 percent.In annualized figures, prices for all finished goods rose 5.7 percent in March. On an unadjusted annualized basis the index was up 5.8 percent in March, the largest such gain since a 5.9 percent increase in March 2010.'"
"'11-04-15,'1','JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks signing a consent agreement, said it would add as many as 3,000 employees to meet the new regulatory demands. Its shares were down 2.8 percent at $44.97. Among other major banks, Citigroup fell 1.6 percent to $4.43; Bank of America was down 1.1 percent to $13.13; Wells Fargo declined 1.7 percent to $30.15; and Goldman Sachs lost 2.7 percent to $155.79.Major indexes closed the day mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.16 points, or 0.12 percent, to 12,285.15, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added less than a point to close at 1,314.52. The Nasdaq composite slipped 1.3 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2.760.22.Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates, said indexes might have gotten late-day help from initial public offerings, like that of the car-sharing company Zipcar, which gained 56 percent.“As we headed into the last hour they were still showing significant gains,” Mr. Lancz said. “That maybe gave a spark to the buyers.”Google rose $2.23, to $578.51, in the regular session but lost more than 5 percent in after-hours trading after reporting a quarterly profit that missed forecasts.Shares of consumer staples were up 0.63 percent as a sector. Supervalu gained more than 16 percent, to $10.61, after forecasting fiscal-year earnings above Wall Street expectations. Kraft Foods closed at $32.95 and Coca-Cola at $68.31, each gaining more than 1 percent.While the banking sector’s responsibility for the mortgage crisis drew most of the attention, analysts said other factors also weighed on the sector.Nomura analysts said in a research note that a downward revision to gross domestic product, negative revenue and loan growth and an unpredictable regulatory backdrop have discouraged investors.“We have spent the past few weeks on the road visiting investors,” the analysts said. “The overwhelming feedback on banks has been ‘Why bother?’ ”“It’s just hard to get people to care about bank stocks right now,” Nomura said.An increase in unemployment filings last week also weighed on the markets, as well as a monthly index on producer prices that showed energy costs were responsible for almost all of the increase in March.Economists are concerned that increases in wholesales prices will be passed along and damp spending by consumers.Downward revisions to economic growth, like the recent cut by the International Monetary Fund in its United States growth estimate, may have discouraged investors, Mr. Valeri added.But the bond market has benefited. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was little changed Thursday at 3.5 percent.“We thought going into this week that it would be a tough week for Treasuries given the fresh supply,” Mr. Valeri said, referring to an auction of 10-year bonds. “A new theme emerging this week that seems to have trumped the data, and even the auctions, was the potential of a slowdown in the economy.”'"
"'11-04-15,'1','LONDON — Police officials said Thursday that they had arrested a third journalist in connection with an expanding case of phone-hacking by reporters at The News of the World, a British tabloid.The Metropolitan Police issued a statement announcing the arrest of a man early Thursday morning “on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile phone voice mail messages” but did not identify the suspect, who was questioned at a London police station and then released on bail without any charges being filed.A person with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the inquiry, said the suspect was James Weatherup, an assistant editor at The News of the World who has also worked as a reporter and news editor there. British news media also identified Mr. Weatherup as the suspect.A biographical entry on the professional social networking site LinkedIn lists “crisis management” as one of Mr. Weatherup’s areas of expertise.Last week, Scotland Yard arrested two journalists from the tabloid, which is one of Britain’s most widely circulated newspapers. The men — Ian Edmondson, who was fired as the tabloid’s news editor this year, and Neville Thurlbeck, the newspaper’s chief reporter — were questioned, like Mr. Weatherup, on suspicion of illegally intercepting voice mail messages.

"'11-04-16,'0','But others reject that argument. Mr. Gray may have stumbled out of the gate, they say, but the charges, which involve a handful of people, represent a simple staffing mistake, not endemic corruption. He is ultimately a man of integrity, they say, who bears little in common with Mr. Barry aside from race.“The fears that he was some type of modern-day Marion Barry were totally off-base,” said Tom Sherwood, co-author of “Dream City: Race, Power and the Decline of Washington, D.C.”“But these early stumbles have allowed that impression to set in,” said Mr. Sherwood, who is also a television news reporter for NBC4 here. “He has to fix that.”The trouble for Mr. Gray started in February with reports in The Washington Post and on the public radio station WAMU asserting that salaries of certain members of his administration were higher than those of their predecessors and exceeded city salary caps. Reports also surfaced of the children of staff members getting jobs with the city, some with little or no vetting.To make matters worse, a former competitor claimed he was paid by Mr. Gray’s campaign to remain a candidate in the mayor’s race last fall, a charge that few seem to believe and that Mr. Gray’s office has strongly denied.Criticism mounted, and by April the Council began holding public hearings.Mr. Gray’s supporters say that it is natural for elected officials to hire their allies, and Mr. Gray had a certain number of positions at his discretion. Most of the allegations concern a small group of people, including Gerri Mason Hall, Mr. Gray’s chief of staff, whom he has since dismissed.“Children of five people in relatively junior positions in a 35,000-person government doesn’t strike me as something to rerun the election over,” said Gregory McCarthy, deputy chief of staff under former Mayor Anthony A. Williams.Mary Cheh, the council member who has conducted the hearings, said that just one of the five children’s jobs appeared to have been an actual instance of nepotism. Still, she said, the administration’s attitude toward assigning jobs and salaries appeared cavalier and tone-deaf when the city is wrestling with a $400 million budget deficit.“These were not big violations, but in politics, appearances can be more important,” Ms. Cheh said. “It made it look like there was an irresponsible party going on.”At the heart of the criticism is the fear that Mr. Gray, a 68-year-old native Washingtonian who has worked with the poor and the disabled as a city administrator for most of his life, has brought with him the aging but powerful system of patronage that prevailed in this city for years.“It was about who you knew, not what you knew,” Mr. Catania said. He added: “I believe Gray to be honest. My quarrel is not with him. It’s with the individuals in which he places so much trust.”People on both sides of the debate say one problem is that Mr. Gray, a relative newcomer to elected politics, is not well known, so people jump to conclusions, including that he will not continue past reforms. In fact, he has kept several key officials from the previous administration, including Kaya Henderson, the deputy of Michelle Rhee, the polarizing former schools chancellor.The city has also changed demographically in recent decades. Blacks are now 50 percent of the population, down from 70 percent in the 1970s, as more Asians, Hispanics and whites have moved in.Marshall Brown, a longtime political operative who is black, was quoted in The Washington Post recently as saying that white newcomers “want doggie parks and bike lanes,” and threaten the identity of Washington as a black city. (He was fired from a political campaign for his remarks.)Mr. Gray, who is also black, prefers to emphasize the things that city residents have in common. In his inaugural address, for example, he acknowledged divisions, but said, “There is far more that brings us together than there is that drives us apart.”The real question, Mr. Sherwood said, is whether Mr. Gray will evolve from the council president he once was into the leader of a vast bureaucracy that is at once city, county and state.“People are waiting to see whether he can grab the reins of city government,” he said. “He has the capacity, but whether he will do it is an open question.”'"
"'11-04-16,'0','The sanctuary where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached in Atlanta is again open to the public. The King family was joined on Friday by members of the civil rights movement and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar in celebrating the reopening of Ebenezer Baptist Church, which is considered the cornerstone of the King legacy.

"'11-04-16,'0','“I hope certainly,” she added, “that there will be good will to take the matter to the end.”The examination will unfold in several steps. First, the Group of 20 will be winnowed down to a smaller group of countries with particularly unstable economies, either because they are bloated by borrowing or because they are overly dependent on exports.The winnowing will be based on a comparison of each country’s fiscal situation and balance of trade with the norms that would be predicted by economic models. Economists then will seek further evidence of distortions by comparing the present situation with the nation’s own history, with other nations at a similar stage of development, and finally with the other members of the Group of 20.The seven nations with the largest economies will be graded on a tougher curve, reflecting their greater importance to the global economy. That makes it much more likely that those countries, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France and Britain, will be selected.Proponents hope the new round of analysis will find a more receptive audience in part because it follows a financial crisis that was fed by the imbalances among nations.The United States and other developed economies are eager to revive growth by increasing exports, but they need help from the developing world, where the crisis was not nearly as painful, and there is little enthusiasm for sharing the pain of recovery.Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said the framework was meant to treat deficits and surpluses as issues of equal concern, placing equal responsibility for change on the developed countries that have borrowed too much and on the developing nations that have relied too much on exports.The developed nations have pushed the evaluation process in the hope that it will create what Ms. Lagarde described as a “very mechanical and very objective process” whose conclusions will be more palatable to developing nations.The initial discussion of the standards in February proved extremely contentious. The Group of 20 moves only by consensus, and nations including China withheld their approval until the last moment.This time, by contrast, the work was done before the finance ministers formally convened on Friday. The remaining details were resolved by staff members after a working dinner Thursday night.A senior Chinese official had grumbled in public earlier this week, describing the standards as a “political tool” intended to suppress China’s growth. But the Chinese delegation offered no public comments on Friday.“It was clear that everybody was really ready to move on to the next stage,” Ms. Brainard said. “Countries had really recognized that this process was going to move forward.”China already has won an important victory, however. The evaluations will not consider a nation’s reserves of foreign currency, but only the balance of imports and exports, a more narrow measure that does not reflect the accumulation of an imbalance over time.Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said there was some basis in research for establishing the appropriate level of foreign reserves, but very little consensus on a method for judging trade balances.He warned that the results therefore would be relatively easy for critics to attack and dismiss as lacking a sound and objective foundation.“It leaves a very effective opportunity for obfuscation and stonewalling,” Professor Prasad said. “And the lack of enforcement mechanism could result in this being just another grounds for squabbling and bickering.”But Professor Prasad added that there still was value in creating a new shared language for discussing imbalances. That point was echoed by George Osborne, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that its influence could well emerge over a longer time frame, and perhaps in unexpected ways.“These international processes do have a habit,” Mr. Osborne said, “of gaining momentum and a will of their own once they’ve started.”'"

"'11-04-16,'0','OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (Reuters) — Burkina Faso’s president dismissed his cabinet and his army chief on Friday, national radio reported, after disgruntled soldiers went on a rampage in the capital and fired their weapons, apparently in a mutiny.President Blaise Compaore also fired the head of his security regiment, national radio said, after the most serious in a string of protests over the past month by disgruntled soldiers, including members of the presidential guard.Mr. Compaore dissolved his government in a statement read over national radio. “The secretary generals of ministerial departments will ensure the execution of current business,” the statement said.Members of the presidential security regiment stationed near Mr. Compaore’s palace had fired into the air in protest late on Thursday, angry that promised benefits had not been paid, said a military official who asked not to be identified.Soldiers from three other barracks joined the protest, and the houses of some military chiefs responsible for the president’s security were attacked, the official said.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Some readers of are unimpressed with the idea of substituting for imported , even though such a move would help wean the country from its dependence on . Or so it appears after I made that argument in my column on Tuesday, noting that natural gas is a fossil fuel we have in abundance and is cleaner than oil to boot.After that column was published, I was buried under an avalanche of angry e-mails and comments, most of them complaining that I had ignored the environmental dangers of drilling for gas, particularly the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a technique that involves shooting water and chemicals into shale formations deep underground.“No mention of the disastrous consequences of fracking?” read one e-mail. Many readers pointed to a study by a Cornell scientist — reported in The Times the same day my column appeared — claiming that methane gas emissions posed a bigger threat to the environment than dirty . Another reader called my column “a disgrace.”Really? Let’s take a closer look. To begin with, fracking is hardly new. In and , it has been used for decades, with nobody complaining much about environmental degradation. It must be a coincidence that these worries surfaced when a natural gas field called the Marcellus Shale was discovered in the Northeast, primarily under and New York. Surely, East Coast residents wouldn’t object to having the country use more natural gas just because it’s going to be drilled in their own backyard instead of, say, downtown . Would they?As for the actual environmental questions, there are three main ones. First, fracking supposedly allows gas and dangerous chemicals to seep into the water supply. This is pretty implausible. Water tables are 1,000 feet or less from the surface; fracking usually takes place well under 7,000 feet. In Dimock, Pa., where methane appears to have leaked into the water supply, state environmental officials say that the problem was not fracking but rather sloppy gas producers who didn’t take proper care in cementing their wells.The second problem is the disposal of the chemical waste. In the , producers bury the waste in sealed containers deep underground. The geology of the Marcellus Shale, however, makes that much more difficult. Some of that waste is being sent to existing underground waste dumps, leading to the possibility of spills. Other waste is being buried in shallower ground, which creates a fear of contamination. Ultimately, producers in the Marcellus Shale will have to do a better job getting rid of the waste.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Re “Poetry for Everyday Life,” by David Brooks (column, April 12), about the “pervasiveness of metaphorical thinking”:Certainly, metaphor is a valuable literary device, and to recognize beauty and creativity in ordinary speech is laudable. But are not David Brooks and the experts he cites using the term “metaphor” metaphorically when they appeal to evidence from language to claim that metaphors are at the “very heart” of how we think?To know that “people use a metaphor every 10 to 25 words” or that a particular 28-word sentence “contains four metaphors” requires being able to identify a metaphor with some precision. Mr. Brooks identifies two metaphors in the sentence he cites, but I cannot figure out what the other two are.Is “recovery” a metaphor because it refers to economics not health? “High” because it describes magnitude of risk not of verticality? “In” because it relates to time not space?It is not immediately apparent which application, or sense, of a word — if any — is to be taken as central or prototypical. The most physical? The most cognitively salient? The most common in usage? Is one person’s metaphor another’s straightforward reference?Indeed, do words “refer” at all, or do they instead provide subjective commentary, a point of view?'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Orchestra officials said they were basically out of cash. Joseph Bondi, a financial consultant advising the management, said the orchestra could meet its bills for only about two more months. Mr. Bondi and the officials spoke in a joint telephone interview.A Chapter 11 filing would also presumably buy time with other business partners, including the orchestra’s landlord, the Kimmel Center. “It gives the company the opportunity to review all of its contracts,” Mr. Bondi said.According to figures provided by the orchestra, ticket sales and other revenue are expected to bring in $14.1 million this season. Annual fund-raising, gala proceeds and endowment income will bring in $18.9 million. The $33 million total compares with what the orchestra said was $46 million needed to run the orchestra. Even with additional, emergency fund-raising, the deficit is expected to be $5 million.A bankruptcy filing is “protection at a time when our cash is running very low, and it’s a path for us to get to our five-year plan,” said Allison Vulgamore, the orchestra’s president and chief executive. The plan envisions raising another $100 million for the endowment, which now stands at $140 million, and $60 million in operating money to invest in the orchestra’s artistic plans, she said. Deficits would continue but diminish.John Koen, a cellist in the orchestra and the head of the players’ union, condemned the bankruptcy filing.“The musicians are extremely opposed to this because it’s unnecessary and it would be damaging to the institution,” Mr. Koen said. “It’s absolutely the wrong decision.”In a tactic previously used by other musicians in labor disputes, the Philadelphia players briefly left the stage before their concert on Thursday night and passed out leaflets to the audience calling on people to oppose a bankruptcy filing. The leaflets said such a filing would make it hard to attract “the best new players” and hurt the orchestra’s ability to raise money.The musicians and orchestra executives have been negotiating to reach a new contract with the help of a mediator since the old pact expired last season. Terms — including salaries — have been frozen since 2008. The players gave up raises in an effort to help, and managers have taken pay cuts. The staff has also been reduced.The orchestra has long been in severe financial difficulties. Mr. Koen blamed high rent at the Kimmel Center and the diversion of revenues from shows at the Academy of Music, its old stage, partly for the problems. Money taken in from presentations there goes to the Kimmel under the orchestra’s arrangement with the hall, Mr. Koen said.Part of the orchestra’s woes stem from a leadership vacuum several years ago when it lacked a permanent board chairman, chief executive and music director. (The French-Canadian Yannick Nézet-Séguin will become music director in September 2012.) Mr. Koen also faulted what he called two decades of bad management, especially a “failure to market the orchestra appropriately and hire quality people for development.”The troubled economy has taken its toll on orchestras. The Detroit Symphony just finished a bruising six-month strike that ended with large pay cuts. The Louisville Symphony filed for bankruptcy reorganization last year, and the symphonies of Honolulu and Syracuse went out of business in recent months, although a group of backers is trying to reconstitute the orchestra in Honolulu.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','The fan, Bryan Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic and father of two from Santa Cruz, remains in a coma with a severely fractured skull and bruising to the frontal lobe of his brain. Witnesses said Stow, who was wearing Giants apparel, was punched and kicked by two unidentified men, one wearing a Dodgers jersey. A $150,000 reward has been offered for information about the assailants.The assault represented a worst-case outcome after mounting complaints about pockets of disorderly and violent behavior inside and outside the 49-year-old stadium. Fans had to wonder whether the cheapest big-time sports ticket in town continued to be worth it, even at $12.As sunset approached on a warm, slightly breezy Thursday evening, the slowly advancing tide of Dodger Blue outside the stadium was laced with currents of a darker shade, officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, ubiquitous on foot, horseback, mountain bicycles and motorcycle, with at least as many inside.This was the Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck’s promised “sea of blue” response to the assault and crowd aggravation, paid for by the Dodgers and possibly overkill for a stadium with an announced attendance of 34,288. While 46 citations were issued, no arrests were reported.The logic of so much protection was reinforced by the concerns of the protected. Mitch Prewett moved to Los Angeles from Oklahoma five years ago and brought his allegiance to the Cardinals with him, support expressed by his faded red cap with the washed-out St. Louis logo.He was “100 percent” set on attending Thursday night’s game before the assault on Stow.“Now I’m 90 percent,” Prewett said, standing outside the entrance to the left-field pavilion. “Like, if I come to this stadium and get beat up,” it’s my fault. Many of the concerns expressed about security at Dodger Stadium have focused on the vast parking lots, some of them better illuminated and, by perception, more secure than others.“After a game you feel alone,” said Scott Bobbitt, a Dodgers fan concerned about safety in the general admission parking lots. “If I park here, close by, I’m fine, but if you get to the G.A. parking, you start feeling like you’re a ways away from everything and there’s no one to ask any questions.”When asked about Stow on Thursday night, other Dodgers fans said they were appalled by what happened, then tried to explain it, or at least rationalize it. For some, the assault needed to be understood in the context of the Giants rivalry, with some using the word “hatred.” For others, like Rick Basaldua, the problems at Dodger Stadium are generational.Everyone, especially in Los Angeles, is different, he said. “The older generation, yeah, they understand that,” he added. “The younger generation, no. They didn’t grow up in a wholesome family environment, where everyone talks to their neighbors.”Basaldua, 29, said the assault was “just sad — no one deserves that.” Then he said: “How did that get started? Someone had to say something. Just keep your mouth shut.”In fact, there has been no indication that Stow and the two people he was with said anything to provoke their assailants. And a cousin of Stow’s has stated that Stow sent him a text message from the game saying he feared for his safety.Still, the code of the visiting sports fan was cited by others besides Basaldua. Gabriel Gallegos addressed it as he stood next to his truck in the parking lot after the game. His son, Asher — “just say anonymous 9-year-old,” the boy joked to a reporter — had been reprimanded by police officers for playing catch with two friends under the parking lot lights.“We’ve never had guys riding around on bikes, telling us what to do,” his father said about the police.The father, a Little League coach, spoke of making a three-hour drive from Tulare up to 10 times a year to watch the Dodgers. He also follows them to San Francisco.“You’ve just got to be a fan who closes your mouth and cheers,” Gallegos said. “When you are for another team in another stadium, you have just got to watch the way you act and the way you talk.”Circumstances and habit dictated Greg Baggerly would essentially adhere to this code Thursday night.As was his practice, Baggerly found his way to a better seat, a level down on the third-base side. Alternately absorbed in the game, a 9-5 Cardinals victory, and his cellphone, he sat alone in his St. Louis garb amid three rows of empty seats.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','The problem is that the industry has been marred by scandal. One of the bigger players, Ultimate Escapes, filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and others, including Exclusive Resorts, have long waiting periods for people who want to sell their shares.But that has not deterred aficionados from sticking with them.By his own estimate, Mark Tavill, a Sacramento entrepreneur who sold his check-cashing business in 2006, will probably lose all of the $300,000 he paid to be a member of Private Escapes, a company started by Mr. Keith that was acquired by Ultimate Escapes in 2009. But that has not stopped Mr. Tavill from being one of the first to buy into Mr. Keith’s new project.“It didn’t sour me on these types of vacation experiences, but I’m certainly not going to hand my money over to someone else to have them do what they want with it,” said Mr. Tavill, who also owns a second home near Lake Tahoe.Mr. Keith said that he was no longer involved with Ultimate Escapes when it went under and that Private Escapes was only 8 percent of the company. But he said the experience had taught him the value of owning the properties outright.The allure of any real estate purchase is a blend of financial sense and romance. So which one is winning out here?HISTORY The industry, according to David Disick, a lawyer and president of the Fractional Consultant, started with cabins in the 1940s.“You and a couple of buddies would buy a cabin in New Hampshire and you’d share everything,” Mr. Disick said. “That morphed into condos and that morphed into condo hotels. That morphed into timeshares to chop up the pieces more. And that morphed into fractionals because people wanted more than a week and the phrase timeshare got a bad name.”In their last iteration, he said, fractional properties become private residence clubs. These are different from destination clubs, where you have a membership but not an actual stake in the properties. Given the number of names, it is no wonder that consumers can get confused.“All of these things are timeshares in a legal sense,” Mr. Disick said, using a term the high-end industry shuns.UPSIDES The big upsides are the exotic locations, the size of the properties and the hotel-like amenities. Financially, the pitch has always been based on comparable costs.After the initial down payment, the maintenance costs or usage fees are less than the nightly rates at a luxury hotel. Equity Estates says its annual fee of $16,500 works out to about $550 a night for a full, 30-day package. The initial membership fee is $375,000.Mr. Keith said that members of the Lifestyle Asset Group had credits worth three to eight weeks a year, depending on when they used them. But the average person will travel 36 days a year, and that works out to $833 a day at a $30,000 annual maintenance charge.Exclusive Resorts bases its membership cost on the number of days people plan to stay each year. To get 30 days, for instance, a membership would cost $309,000. It also charges a daily maintenance cost of $1,000.The club operators argue that the distinguishing factor is that members stay in a 4,000-square-foot home with their friends, as opposed to a 400-square-foot suite. Aficionados agree.“You look at hotels — you’re too crowded, you’re too cramped in, you need something bigger and you hope the rooms are adjoining,” said Mr. Tavill, who has three children. “It’s all silly stuff, but it takes away from the overall experience. We need to be in a house and spread out.”Mr. Keith said that since members of the Lifestyle Asset Group would actually own the houses, they could make a profit when the properties were sold in seven or eight years.“If we’re fortunate, that $2.2 million home will be worth $3 million,” he said.DOWNSIDES There are two big disadvantages to buying into one of these groups. In most of them, you do not own the underlying assets. Ultimate Escapes was structured this way. The company also borrowed heavily to buy the real estate, so there was little underlying equity.But generally the big risk is that you don’t like what you bought into. It could be a long time before you could get your money back.Mr. Potter said that in the best possible situation, there was at least a two-year waiting list to leave Exclusive Resorts, and even then, the buyer would get back only 75 percent of the initial down payment.“For every member who would like to leave, we have to sell three new memberships,” he said.Exclusive, however, has some 370 homes for its 3,300 members. So as long as you or the group do not run out of money, there are plenty of places to go.The Lifestyle Asset Group encourages members to sell privately if they come under duress. But the group has what Mr. Keith concedes is a “draconian option” for people who need to get out immediately: the company will buy the share back at 50 cents on the dollar.Others have slightly less onerous exit terms. Equity Estates allows one person out for each one who comes in. While it brokers the deal, it also allows the exiting member to benefit from the appreciation, less a 7.5 percent transaction cost.“People do this because of the joy of traveling that they will have with us,” Philip Mekelburg, chief executive of Equity Estates, said. “Most of the people doing this could afford a multimillion-dollar home. They like the diversity.”Beyond that, you get a home that will accommodate your family, and you’ll never have to repair it. What is that worth?'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Like Dr. Pauling, who won the Nobel in chemistry in 1954 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962, Dr. Lipscomb was an admired teacher.  He was on the faculty at Harvard from 1959 until his retirement in 1990. Three of his doctoral students went on to win Nobel Prizes in chemistry.“He was always accessible; the door to his office was always open,” said Roald Hoffmann, professor emeritus of chemistry at Cornell University and one of Dr. Lipscomb’s Nobel protégés in 1981. He added, “He created a beautiful and coherent body of work on an important group of molecules that had eluded simple description.”A man of multiple talents known for his wry sense of humor and his signature string tie, Dr. Lipscomb was a classical clarinetist who performed in chamber groups and had been principal clarinetist with the Pasadena Civic Orchestra and the Minneapolis Civic Orchestra.He was not above dropping comical elements into his scientific publications. In one 1972 paper, he noted: “We admittedly made this observation with the benefit of hindsight. This science is known as retrospectroscopy.”William Nunn Lipscomb Jr. was born on Dec. 9, 1919, in Cleveland. When he was a year old, his family moved to Lexington, Ky. One of his early doctoral students gave him his nickname, Colonel, for his Kentucky roots. In 1973, the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels made him a member.Receiving the proverbial chemistry set as a birthday gift at age 11, Dr. Lipscomb became obsessed with science. He later recalled creating “evil smells” using hydrogen sulfide to drive his two sisters out of his room and nearly blowing up the house while concocting gunpowder for homemade fireworks.Despite his prowess, Dr. Lipscomb told his son, James, that he received a C in high school chemistry. His grade, based on just the final exam, demanded that he memorize the first 10 elements of the periodic table, but Dr. Lipscomb could not be bothered by such mundane tasks. “I could just look it up,” he said. “So I didn’t do it.”Dr. Lipscomb attended the University of Kentucky on a music scholarship but graduated with a degree in chemistry in 1941. He went on to work with Dr. Pauling and earned his doctorate in chemistry at Caltech in 1946. He joined Harvard after 13 years at the University of Minnesota. From 1982 to 1990 he was on the board of directors of Dow Chemical.Besides his son, James, and a daughter, Dorothy, from his marriage to the former Mary Adele Sargent, Dr. Lipscomb is survived by his second wife, Jean Evans; their daughter, Jenna; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.In his later years, Dr. Lipscomb was a regular participant in the annual Ig Nobel Prize awards in Cambridge, sponsored by the Annals of Improbable Research. “We have a bunch of Nobel Prize winners who hand out our prizes,” said Marc Abrahams, the founder of the Ig Nobels. “Bill ended up as our grand star. He played clarinet at the beginning and end of each show, and he narrated funny videos we post on our Web site. He just had great timing.”Dr. Lipscomb may also be the only Nobel laureate featured in a YouTube video offering instructions on how to tie a string tie.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','At least 12 other people have begun cases against the newspaper, and at the hearing a lawyer for the Metropolitan Police said that officers had discovered at least 91 possible victims, and potentially many more.The courtroom was crammed with lawyers: for phone-hacking victims like Ms. Miller and Mr. Andrew; for the News of the World’s parent company, News Group Newspapers; for the police department, which has assigned 40 officers to the criminal case; and for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired in the mid-2000s by News of the World.Along with the News of the World’s royalty reporter, Clive Goodman, Mr. Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for hacking into the phones of aides to members of the royal family. Information found in his notebooks, which have been seized by the police, has led in the past few weeks to the detention and questioning of three senior News of the World journalists on suspicion of engaging in phone hacking.At the hearing, Mr. Mulcaire’s lawyer, Alexandra Marzec, said he wanted to protect himself against possible criminal charges and was admitting to nothing.“The admissions which have been made by News Group in the past week are made solely on behalf of News Group, and Mr. Mulcaire does not admit doing anything, and does not associate himself with these admissions,” Ms. Marzec said.The police said that they were currently going through 9,200 pages of material seized from Mr. Mulcaire.Meanwhile, in a separate but related case, the police said they were considering opening an investigation into whether journalists had paid police officers for information. The move stems from remarks made in 2003 by Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor and now the chief executive of News International, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and is News Group’s parent company.Mrs. Brooks told the culture and media committee at the time that “we have paid the police for information in the past.” Asked this week about the remark, Mrs. Brooks said in a letter to a different parliamentary group, the home affairs committee, that she had been speaking generally.“I was responding to a specific line of questioning on how newspapers get information,” she wrote. “My intention was simply to comment on the widely held belief that payments had been made in the past to police officers. If, in doing so, I gave the impression that I had knowledge of any specific cases, I can assure you that this was not my intention.”In a letter to the home affairs committee, Assistant Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said that a senior officer had been assigned “to conduct a scoping exercise to establish whether there are now any grounds for beginning a criminal investigation resulting from the comments made by Rebekah Brooks” in 2003.A spokeswoman for News International said the company had no comment.'"
"'11-04-16,'0','There is no definitive proof that any of this will make a lasting impact. “It would be 20 years before we would know the results,” said Laura Levine, JumpStart’s executive director, who served on Sesame Street’s advisory panel.But the beauty of watching young children absorb these lessons and answering their questions is that it can make you more aware of the financial examples you set. Every shopping trip and holiday gift can become a teaching moment about hard choices, patience and generosity.So here are how the lessons break down:SAVE The title of Sesame Street’s package of videos also serves to sum up its component parts: “For Me, For You, For Later.” The literal representation of it are the three labels that come with the DVD in a kit that you can pick up free at any PNC Bank, which is Sesame Street’s partner in the project. You can also download the labels and other print materials on the Web; I’ve linked to the Sesame and PNC sites from the online version of this column.The three labels read “Spending,” “Saving” and “Sharing.” Children are supposed to affix them to three clear plastic jars where they can drop their coins and bills.None of this is particularly new. In fact, a company called Snigglezoo Entertainment has been using puppets called the Money Mammals for years. They sing about the virtues of saving, sharing and spending, the very same terms that Sesame Street uses.John Lanza, Snigglezoo’s self-described chief mammal, said he was still processing the similarities and declined to comment further. Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop’s senior vice president for outreach and educational practices, said it had been aware of Snigglezoo’s (and many other) trademarks around the terms and noted that the words were in wide use. Nevertheless, she added that Sesame used the words in a unique way for its own specific purposes.But only Sesame has Elmo, and millions of children are very likely to try to mimic his behavior. In the video, he’s trying to save $5 to buy a “stupendous” ball from a street vendor. At one point, he turns down ice cream so he doesn’t lose ground on reaching his ultimate goal.This moment goes by in a flash, but it is a crucial one. It isn’t easy for a child (Elmo is perpetually 3 1/2 years old) to give up something pleasurable in the moment in exchange for something bigger and better later on.If you need evidence of this, pop some corn, grab the family, flip on YouTube and search for the (absolutely hysterical) marshmallow tests. Researchers put the confection in front of small children and tell them they can have one now if they’d like, though if they leave it on the table they can have two later on. Then, they leave the room and flip the switch on the camera to see what the children do.Many devour the marshmallow before the tester even leaves the room, but that doesn’t have to be a permanent condition.“I think there is a lot about this process that is a learned skill,” said Russell N. James III, who teaches in the financial planning division at Texas Tech University. “It’s like soccer or other physical skills, where you can coach them. And you want to give them opportunities where they can exercise those skills.”That’s where the piggy banks and the jars come in. And when Mr. James’s 6-year-old daughter coveted the Nook e-reader that her older sister got for Christmas, he told her that if she did not touch the holiday money she had received from her grandparents for 30 days he would give her the rest of the money she needed for the Nook.“A year would be too long,” he said. “Because you want them to practice a lot and do it several times under different circumstances.”SPEND This is the easy part for children, at least at first glance. What’s much harder, however, is determining what different things are worth.Sesame Street takes a couple of stabs at this in the public service announcements that accompany its main video, where Beth Kobliner, author of “Get a Financial Life” (Fireside, 2009) and an occasional contributor to The New York Times, appears alongside Elmo. In one segment, Elmo has to decide between two apples and one mango for the same price.In another, various children decide between larger sizes of six paints and smaller sizes of 12 for the same price or bigger packages of plain pencils and smaller packages of colored ones.The “Pretty Penny” book has a slightly more sophisticated take on this. Penny must decide how much to sell her various items for in the mall, and she manages to do it without any help from grown-ups.No preschooler I know could pull this off, but the book’s author, Devon Kinch, said the actual prices were less important than the idea of relative value. “The prices are just talking points for parents to jump in and talk about these ideas,” she said. “Some things can be fixed, and others are slightly damaged or new. It’s a conversation-starter.”SHARE Designating one jar or part of the piggy bank for “sharing” instead of “giving,” is a smart twist, as it builds on play date and preschool skills that many children are already learning.Some parents may worry about teaching charity so soon, lest their offspring be frightened by exposure to deprivation and poverty before they are ready to place it all in context.It’s not such a leap to share money with those in your community, however, whether it’s donating to the local zoo or passing it along to your house of worship. In one of the Sesame Street segments, a child buys food for cats that a local animal rescue service is caring for.Sharing with friends in need is a fine idea, too, though Sesame’s depiction of this is rather odd. Cookie Monster, who even in 2011 still has trouble with impulse control, ends up eating the dollar he was planning to spend on cookies. So Elmo hands over a dollar.Cookie hardly seems like the most worthy recipient of a disciplined saver’s largess, though the Sesame staff seem to think that young viewers will treat this as some kind of inside joke. “He plays the role of a typical preschooler who may be having a really hard time with the question of why he can’t have something right now,” said Gary Knell, Sesame Workshop’s president and chief executive. “They sort of get the message that, ‘Gee, I don’t really want to be like him. But I can laugh at him.’ ”EARN The Sesame video package introduces the idea that there are lots of ways to make a little bit of money on the side if you’re industrious. Elmo earns a few bucks by folding clothes and helping Luis fix a broken ice cream machine.The “Pretty Penny” book ties all these themes together in a particularly linear package. With no money saved, Penny must earn the money she needs to spend on a special occasion to share with her grandmother. This was no accident, said Ms. Kinch, the author, who has struggled with debt in the past and carefully picked the topic for what will be a four-book series.“They are constant themes in everyone’s life: Do you have it? Do you need it? How do you get it and what do you do with it?” she said. “It is impossible to teach one of the money themes without overlapping another one.”'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Open war between the Gulf Cartel and its former enforcers, the Zetas, means that the roads here are still filled with gang lookouts on motorcycles, who report back to cartel leaders, residents say.Gunmen believed to be tied to the Zetas assassinated the lead candidate for governor last year and later forced a mass exodus from a small town near the Texas border. Extortion payments have become more regular than , security analysts say, while many of the authorities are either terrorized or bought off: 16 municipal police officers have been arrested so far in connection with kidnappings and killings.“It is one of the places where clearly state, federal and local authorities are not in control,” said Eric Olson, a security expert at the International Center. “It’s tragic, it’s unfortunate, but it’s a reality.”For the Mexican government, few things are as sensitive as an American pointing out lost territory. When Secretary of State likened Mexico’s drug trafficking last year to an insurgency, “where the narco-traffickers control certain parts of the country,” Mexican lawmakers responded with fierce condemnation.The tensions only worsened after Carlos Pascual, the American ambassador, questioned Mexico’s crime-fighting abilities in diplomatic cables, quoting a former high-ranking Mexican official who “expressed a real concern with ‘losing’ certain regions” of the country to cartels. Mexico’s president, , was so infuriated by that cable and others that he insisted on pushing out Mr. Pascual, who resigned last month.And yet, despite promises of help, the families and residents here say they have seen little progress in Tamaulipas. Instead, they have witnessed squabbling between top officials — Tamaulipas is governed by political rivals to the president’s party — and lackluster enforcement.Mr. Román, the father of two missing sons, complained that government checkpoints were always in the same place and easy for criminals to avoid. Alfonso Ortega, whose brother Martín disappeared a year ago on his way to Matamoros, described a galling lack of urgency.“The government is not moving,” Mr. Ortega said. “It’s not doing anything.”The authorities believe the Zetas are behind the murders in San Fernando, though they have only theories about the motives: kidnappings for ransom, perhaps, or attempts at forced recruitment.Regardless, experts say the trouble in Tamaulipas stems partly from the gang’s history. Its leaders started out as enforcers, so when they split with their former patrons in the Gulf Cartel a few years ago, the Zetas could not rely on historic ties with drug suppliers or traffickers. To thrive and expand, they branched out to other crimes, including extortion, migrant smuggling and the siphoning of oil and gas from pipelines in the area.Many of the gang’s early leaders served in the Mexican military, and they have used their experience to create a level of intimidation that outmatches most rivals’. No local newspaper dares to print the photos the government has issued for the 17 suspects in the latest San Fernando killings.Mr. Román, a burly man in rubber sandals who has driven back and forth countless times from his home in to prod the authorities, is just one of many here with once hidden tales of fear, a sullen bureaucracy and overwhelmed investigators.He said that all the official attention now focused on identifying the dead here has made his sons’ loss even more painful. “They don’t help you look for your sons when they are alive,” he said.Indeed, the morgue and the prosecutor’s office next door are now the area’s main hubs of activity. This week, dozens of people shifted uncomfortably on chairs in tiled hallways, their sadness subdued as they waited to give statements.Next door, bodies came and went. At one point, a refrigerated truck with dozens of corpses wrapped in black plastic left for Mexico City, where additional investigators would continue the process.Those waiting here looked exhausted beyond grief or anger. “I just ask God to bring him back, even if he’s dead,” said Ana María López, whose husband disappeared in the border city of Reynosa on March 11.Nicolasa Carvajal López said she had come from , where she lives, because she feared the worst for her brother Bolívar Santamaría López. He boarded a bus in his home state, Guerrero, on March 29 along with five friends bound for Reynosa, where they planned to cross into Texas.The men promised to call when they arrived at the border. When they did not, Mr. Santamaría’s wife and the other relatives forced the news out of the bus company: the bus had been stopped by gunmen in San Fernando and all the men and boys had been forced off.“We were pooling our money,” said Ms. Carvajal, covering her face with her hand as she explained that all 10 of her brother’s siblings in the had paid for his trip. “He was coming to make a living.”She pointed to several photos of her missing brother. He was 45, strong, with a sandy-colored mustache. “I still have hope that he will call me and say, ‘Hey there, Sis, here I am,’ ” she said.The authorities have told the families to be patient, that many people are missing. And once again, they have pledged to make the area safe.On Tuesday, José Francisco Blake Mora, Mexico’s interior minister, promised to secure all the roads around San Fernando and to prosecute the killers.But few of those who are arrested in Mexico are ever convicted. And Msgr. Faustino Armendáriz, the bishop of Matamoros, doubted that the government was doing enough. “By their fruits, you shall know what is being done,” he responded with biblical flourish. Then, he ticked off the towns of his diocese. “When you pass through,” he said, “there is a great sense of vulnerability.”He added that drug gangs had sown fear into the people of his diocese for more than a year. Now, he prays for change — and demands that the government keep its promises.“We have to hope that this time they act on all their declarations,” he said, referring to the state and federal governments. “We have to demand that there are conditions to live in security.”'"
"'11-04-16,'0','Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.5 percent in the broader index and a 0.2 percent rise in the core index.But underlying pressures as reflected in the core index are low. Mr. Hoffman and other economists said that the index was within the “comfort zone” of the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making board meets on April 26. As such, they said they did not expect the Fed to take any action on rates or its quantitative easing program, known as QE2, which is purchasing $600 billion in government securities.“I think they will say the economy is on firmer footing,” Mr. Hoffman said. “At the end of the day they will reaffirm they are going to finish QE2.”But he emphasized that the central bank would remain concerned about inflation expectations of consumers, who could demand higher wages, and businesses, which could raise prices and perhaps cut spending.The relatively slow increase of prices in the services sector, and the decline in apparel prices, were helping to offset price rises elsewhere, Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said in a research note.Friday’s report showed that prices for all types of gasoline rose 5.6 percent in March, after a 4.7 percent increase in February. It was the ninth consecutive increase in the gas index. Food costs increased 0.8 percent in March, after climbing 0.6 percent in February, the biggest jump since September 2008.Economists have been concerned that higher energy costs will constrain consumer spending, even though they expect oil prices to decline in the second half of the year. Consumers have also been coping with a trend of higher food costs, as bad weather has hit some agricultural commodities, including corn and wheat, while vegetable prices have risen because of cold weather in parts of the South. Cotton prices have also soared.Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and a senior vice president for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, said the Fed would be watching commodity prices over the coming months but would most likely remain on the sidelines until 2012 as it gauged the sustainability of the recovery.“You will start to see them talk about their exit strategy going forward,” he said.Higher prices were also in focus in global economies. Higher consumer prices were reported Friday in India, Europe and China. In China, figures showed consumer prices rose 5.4 percent in March, up from February’s 4.9 percent. Inflation in the 17-nation euro region increased to an annualized rate of 2.7 percent, from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s statistics office reported Friday.Japan was highlighted in another economic report in the United States on Friday. A Federal Reserve report said industrial production grew 0.8 percent in March, above analysts’ forecasts of 0.6 percent and compared with a slight 0.1 percent rise in February. The report included a 0.7 percent rise in manufacturing output, especially for durables, and motor vehicles and parts. But in the coming months, the sector could start to feel disruptions in supply caused by the March 11 earthquake in Japan, economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report. In the United States, the report on consumer prices came after one on prices for wholesalers on Thursday. In that report, the Labor Department said higher energy costs accounted for almost all of the increase in the Producer Price Index, which was up 0.7 percent in March, when prices for a barrel of crude oil reached levels not seen since September 2008, partly as turmoil in the Middle East heightened perceptions that supplies could be disrupted.'"

"'11-04-17,'0','“I think that he, for the first time, thinks that this is his team, and he was responsible for getting us to the playoffs,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said Saturday, adding, “He took it on his shoulders in good times and bad times, going, ‘It’s me.’ ”If the Knicks have any chance of upsetting the Celtics in this first-round series, it will begin once more with Stoudemire, their fantastically skilled power forward, who averaged 25.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks this season.And if matters grow tense, if the Knicks’ resolve wavers, it will probably be Stoudemire who pulls the group together and steadies them — “the one constant voice,” as D’Antoni said, who keeps pushing them forward.D’Antoni has long admired Stoudemire’s skills and athleticism, but he was not always so enamored of his demeanor. Nor, it should be said, was Stoudemire always so enamored of D’Antoni’s coaching style.They spent four mostly glorious seasons together with the Phoenix Suns, lighting up scoreboards and making deep playoff runs. But as expectations rose, so did the tensions. Stoudemire was never fully dedicated to defense. D’Antoni did not always connect with Stoudemire, who other than Steve Nash was the Suns’ most important player.There were concerns about Stoudemire’s maturity and his commitment while recovering from a knee injury — issues that were detailed in “Seven Seconds or Less,” the book that chronicled the Suns’ 2005-6 season.As the book’s author, Jack McCallum, recalled in an interview last week, Stoudemire “was just an immature kid who didn’t do his rehab as assiduously as he should, wasn’t a great teammate, was sometimes selfish and did lock horns with Mike over that, no question about it.”Some of those who worked with D’Antoni and Stoudemire played down the issues between them. But McCallum, who had unlimited access that season, said the tension was real.“I’m pleasantly — and emphasis on pleasantly — surprised by what’s happened,” he said of the successful reunion.Stoudemire was just 22 when D’Antoni began his first full season as the Suns’ coach in 2004. D’Antoni was somewhat of a rookie himself, having spent nearly a decade working in Italy. Both are headstrong.But they have evolved since their bitter parting in 2008, when each took veiled shots at the other after a shocking first-round loss to San Antonio. D’Antoni was forced out and joined the Knicks for a painful overhaul. Stoudemire and the Suns struggled under a new coach, Terry Porter.“I’m much more appreciative of what he brings,” D’Antoni said, adding, “I always had him, so I didn’t know what it was without him.“You get a little jaded,” D’Antoni continued, “and the pressure’s on you to win a championship and you don’t appreciate all the things that he’s done. I also think that he’s gone to a level that makes you appreciative of it. So it’s a little give-and-take on both our parts. I think the guy’s terrific, and he’s doing an unbelievable job.”D’Antoni’s private evaluations of Stoudemire have been just as effusive. He told one friend that Stoudemire has become just as strong a leader as Nash is.Cynics viewed this reunion as a marriage of convenience: the Knicks needed a franchise player after being snubbed by LeBron James. Stoudemire needed a team that could afford to pay him $100 million.All of that is true, but it obscures the personal connections that — despite their earlier battles — drew D’Antoni and Stoudemire together again. Months before free agency opened last year, D’Antoni began enthusiastically floating Stoudemire’s name in discussions with friends.D’Antoni was the first person to call Stoudemire when the free-agent period began at 12:01 a.m. July 1. Whatever differences they had were settled in an air-clearing session over breakfast a few days later.“I think Amar’e grew up, matured a lot, became a leader,” Stoudemire’s longtime agent, Happy Walters, said. “Mike matured as a coach and learned to control things with his players and involve them, especially his stars. That was key for both of them.”After years of deferring to Nash, Stoudemire “wanted a team that he could call his own,” said Suns Coach Alvin Gentry, a former member of D’Antoni’s staff. “I think that was important to Amar’e.”Stoudemire won the affection of Knicks fans with one signature and one declaration: “The Knicks are back.” He delivered by leading the Knicks to their first winning record in 10 years.A younger Stoudemire might have felt threatened by the arrival of another marquee star. But Stoudemire welcomed Anthony, made room for him in the offense and patiently rode out Anthony’s erratic first month. When Anthony strayed, it was Stoudemire who publicly but diplomatically called on his teammate to “buy into Mike D’Antoni’s system.”On Saturday, Stoudemire praised D’Antoni for becoming “more of a player’s coach” who does “a phenomenal job of communicating with everybody.” There is no longer any doubt about the bond between them.“It had to be something positive for me to want to sign here,” Stoudemire said. “He was the coach. So it was a great, great opportunity for me to team back up with him. Ever since then, we’ve been on the same page, from the start.”'"
"'11-04-17,'0','“My grandkids will lose their college fund,” he added, “so I have to dance around it.”Elton Brand, who finished with 17 points for Philadelphia — and made the only free throw he tried — expressed surprise at not getting to the line more. “It’s kind of discouraging,” he said. “At the same time, we know we have to keep going.”James, Wade and Bosh gained a degree of notoriety last July for their preening debut after the decisions by James and Bosh to join Wade on the Heat. They exuded confidence then, and after 58 regular-season victories earned the Heat the second seed in the Eastern Conference, they had every reason to go into the series against the 76ers, who finished 41-41, with a certain amount of swagger.The postseason debuts of James and Bosh for the Heat attracted an AmericanAirlines Arena sellout crowd of 19,600. And just in case anybody in the Miami locker room needed reassuring, blue paper strips the length of a child’s ruler were placed on each player’s cushioned cubicle before the game. On each was the saying “With confidence you have won before you have started.”In the other locker room, the underdogs from Philadelphia could point to their 30-19 record since the start of 2011 to bolster their belief in themselves. The 76ers played the first quarter as if they expected every shot to fall, and nearly all of them did. They converted 11 of their first 14 field-goal attempts to race to a 25-11 lead after 8:02.“They were playing at a different speed than us,” Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said, adding, “They’re relentless with that athleticism, that quickness and the way they play.”Collins says that confidence is leaked, not lost. “I don’t think anybody ever takes your confidence,” he has said. “I think you give it away.”As the second quarter wore on and the 76ers’ shots stopped falling and the fouls started piling up, they sputtered, as if they were running low on nerve. Behind James’s 12 points in the quarter, the Heat took a 54-49 lead into halftime. Miami extended its advantage to 78-62 near the end of the third quarter.Bosh, appearing in his first playoff game in three years, scored 15 of his game-high 25 points in the second half. He was 8 of 17 from the field, and after the game he lamented those nine missed shots.“The plus is that after the first quarter, we settled down and did a good job on the defensive side,” he said.A free throw by Bosh in the third minute of the fourth quarter gave the Heat an 11-point lead. Could the 76ers patch the leak in their confidence?“How would we respond when they punched us in the mouth?” Collins said. “I thought we did very well.”Led by Thaddeus Young (20 points), Philadelphia’s sixth man in title only, the 76ers whittled the Heat’s advantage to 88-87 with 2:03 left. Wade, who had picked up his fifth foul with 7:20 left, returned with 3:58 left and carried the Heat. He had 6 of his 17 points in the final two minutes and 2 of his 7 rebounds in the final 20 seconds to hold off the 76ers.“He has the intelligence and he is savvy enough to play with five fouls,” Spoelstra said.After leading the Heat to the N.B.A. title in 2006, Wade has the savvy, but also the confidence, to take his team the distance.'"

"'11-04-17,'0','The inquiry over hydrofracking, which was initiated by the House Energy and Commerce Committee when Mr. Waxman led it last year, also found that 14 of the nation’s most active hydraulic fracturing companies used 866 million gallons of hydraulic fracturing products — not including water. More than 650 of these products contained chemicals that are known or possible human carcinogens, regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, or are listed as hazardous air pollutants, the report said.A request for comment from the American Petroleum Institute about the report received no reply.Matt Armstrong, an energy attorney from Bracewell & Giuliani that represents several companies involved in natural gas drilling, faulted the methodology of the congressional report released Saturday and an earlier report by the same lawmakers.""This report uses the same sleight of hand deployed in the last report on diesel use -- it compiles overall product volumes, not the volumes of the hazardous chemicals contained within those products,"" he said. ""This generates big numbers but provides no context for the use of these chemicals over the many thousands of frac jobs that were conducted within the timeframe of the report.""Some ingredients mixed into the hydraulic fracturing fluids were common and generally harmless, like salt and citric acid. Others were unexpected, like instant coffee and walnut hulls, the report said. Many ingredients were “extremely toxic,” including benzene, a known human carcinogen, and lead.Companies injected large amounts of other hazardous chemicals, including 11.4 million gallons of fluids containing at least one of the toxic or carcinogenic B.T.E.X. chemicals — benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene. The companies used the highest volume of fluids containing one or more carcinogens in Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas.The report comes two and a half months after an initial report by the same three lawmakers that found that 32.2 millions of gallons of fluids containing diesel, considered an especially hazardous pollutant because it contains benzene, were injected into the ground during hydrofracking by a dozen companies from 2005 to 2009, in possible violation of the drinking water act.A 2010 report by Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, found that benzene levels in other hydrofracking ingredients were as much as 93 times higher than those found in diesel.The use of these chemicals has been a source of concern to regulators and environmentalists who worry that some of them could find their way out of a well bore — because of above-ground spills, underground failures of well casing or migration through layers of rock — and into nearby sources of drinking water.These contaminants also remain in the fluid that returns to the surface after a well is hydrofracked. A recent investigation by The New York Times found high levels of contaminants, including benzene and radioactive materials, in wastewater that is being sent to treatment plants not designed to fully treat the waste before it is discharged into rivers. At one plant in Pennsylvania, documents from the Environmental Protection Agency revealed levels of benzene roughly 28 times the federal drinking water standard in wastewater as it was discharged, after treatment, into the Allegheny River in May 2008.The E.P.A. is conducting a national study on the drinking water risks associated with hydrofracking, but assessing these risks has been made more difficult by companies’ unwillingness to publicly disclose which chemicals and in what concentrations they are used, according to internal e-mails and draft notes of the study plan.Some companies are moving toward more disclosure, and the industry will soon start a public database of these chemicals. But the Congressional report said that reporting to this database is strictly voluntary, that disclosure will not include the chemical identity of products labeled as proprietary, and that there is no way to determine if companies are accurately reporting information for all wells. In Pennsylvania, the lack of disclosure of drilling ingredients has also incited a heated debate among E.P.A. lawyers about the threat and legality of treatment plants accepting the wastewater and discharging it into rivers.'"

"'11-04-17,'0','The inventory of homes priced over $2.5 million amounted to slightly under five years’ worth last year at this time; now it is slightly over five years.In general, it still takes less time to sell lower-priced homes than more expensive ones, said Jeffrey G. Otteau, the president of the New Brunswick-based company that did the research.The inventory of homes on the market for under $400,000 — a total of 44,288 houses, condominiums and co-ops in that category as of March 1 — would take an estimated 13.6 months to sell if no additional homes were to be listed, according to the Otteau report.This is vastly less time than it would take to sell the 3,442 houses with asking prices of $1 million or more.But the sales picture for lower-priced homes has worsened significantly in the last year. Part of that shift can be ascribed to the vanished tax credit, part to the now-prevalent mortgage lenders’ requirement of a 20 percent down payment — a hurdle that many first-time buyers cannot leap.At the same point in 2010, there was a 10.9-month supply of lower-priced homes on the market, and sales were 13 percent higher than they are now.Mr. Otteau described the overall market as having a faint pulse, sapped by weakness in the entry-level housing category — the largest price category by far, and the most important factor in a healthy market since it generates “move-up” buyers in other categories.For houses ranging from $400,000 to $599,999, the report showed, the situation has also deteriorated since last year. Supply has increased 17 percent statewide, to 14.9 months’ worth. In some parts of the state, this price category fared even worse in comparison to last year than did the price niche below it.In Bergen County in January and February there was actually a slight increase over last year in the number of homes that sold for less than $400,000. But there were 22 percent fewer sales of homes priced from $400,000 to $599,999.In Essex County there were fewer sales in both ranges, though in the lower niche the dip was 9 percent, whereas in the above-$400,000 it was 43 percent. Only 34 homes in the second-tier price range were sold in the first two months, versus 60 last year.In Morris County, sales were off by 27 percent in the lowest price range and 37 percent for the next price range (although the number of homes being marketed for $400,000 to $600,000 remained the same as the year before).In Morris County so far this year, there have been more sales than last year in the range from $600,000 to $1 million, reflecting the overall picture in the state.And in Bergen County there were more sales of homes priced above $1 million than in the previous year, which was also true statewide.In the 21 counties monitored by the Otteau Group, which issues monthly reports to subscribers in the real estate business, there were 4 percent more houses for sale and 13 percent fewer sales as of March 2011 than as of March 2010.That is 14.3 months’ worth of inventory sitting on the market this year, versus one year’s worth in March 2010.'"
"'11-04-17,'0','Recently a car backed into my parked car and drove off, leaving my bumper damaged. I was able to track down the culprit thanks to a surveillance camera, and he agreed to compensate me for the cost of the bumper at the lowest estimate I got, which was $576. He provided me with a check for that amount. The mechanic later said that he could probably bang the dent out and repaint it, making it look “almost” new, for just $100. My wife says that I have an obligation to return the balance of $476 to the offending driver. I’m not sure. What says the Ethicist? ARI WALISEVER, WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.The guy sounds like a jerk, and you might have told him to give you $576 just for ruining your day. If you had tried that, and he agreed, you could have used the money for whatever you wanted, even if you had been planning to junk your car later that afternoon and give up driving forever. But that’s not what happened: you got him to agree, specifically, to cover the very precise cost of auto-body work — repairs, not reparations.That means you can take (or keep) only as much money as the repair will cost — not as much as you think you deserve. If you want an “almost” repair, get that and return the difference. If you want the full museum-quality restoration, go for it. He broke it; he bought it.You didn’t have to conduct these negotiations yourself, of course; that’s what is for. But because you chose to, you ought to stay true to your word. And to your mechanic! Who has ever heard of an estimate being revised downward?I am a high-school student. Recently my school came up for review. Members of an accreditation board walked around the school for a few days, observing classes and asking students questions. Accreditation reviewers pulled students out of the crowd to speak at length. This was a huge deal for the administration. To prepare, many of my teachers began coaching us. They told us what to say if one of the accreditation reviewers asked us about certain education standards and asked us not to say anything negative about our school.I felt uncomfortable during all of this. By coaching us, aren’t our teachers subverting the inspection? Or is it expected that preparations should be made? NAME WITHHELD, , CALIF.'"
"'11-04-17,'0','We seem to be in one of those periodic revivals of the American missionary spirit, which manifests itself in everything from quiet kindness to patronizing advice to armored divisions. These days the spirit is most evident, of course, in our yearning to embrace the aspiring democrats across North Africa and the Middle East.The urge to intervene is not uniquely American, but it is one strong fiber in our national character, woven of optimism, generosity and chutzpah. The idea of saving souls was embedded in the Charter of Massachusetts Bay, putting a gloss of missionary purpose on the original Colonial project.The impulse both does us proud and gets us into trouble. Sometimes the result is commendable (the Marshall Plan, the Dayton accords) and sometimes not so much (our arming of the anti-Soviet mujahedeen in Afghanistan). We have big hearts but short attention spans.In foreign-policy journals, students of America’s role have long argued about which deserves priority: our ideals or our interests — the desire to share the freedoms we have or the obligation to protect our security and husband our resources. In practice, that’s often a false choice; the imperatives overlap. One reason we proselytize for democracy and human rights is that we believe a world that’s more like ours is less threatening. The war in Iraq had multiple pretexts, both idealistic and pragmatic: containing an ostensible threat, rescuing Iraqis from a monster, sowing seeds of freedom in an oppressed region.The American missionary impulse crosses boundaries of party and ideology. Paul Wolfowitz, the Bush defense deputy who argued that invading Iraq would catalyze new freedom across the region, and Samantha Power, the Obama adviser whose passion for humanitarian intervention has helped drive our involvement in Libya, are more alike than either would probably admit. Although Power opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003, she would have used force in 1988 to stop Saddam Hussein from gassing the Kurds. And on stopping the bloodletting in Libya, Wolfowitz and Power are singing from the same hymnal.Eight years ago, when I was an Op-Ed columnist for this paper, I aligned myself with something I called the I-Can’t-Believe-I’m-a-Hawk Club — baby boomers whose distrust of foreign intervention, forged during the bloody mess of Vietnam, was tempered by the noble rescue of Bosnia and Kosovo, leading to a grudging sympathy for the invasion of Iraq. I’m sure the Bush administration did not need permission from the East Coast pundit chorus to go to war, but it was a high-water mark of the missionary impulse.Some members of that club have since repudiated their support for the Iraq invasion. Others have not. It’s intriguing to watch them variously extrapolating from Baghdad to Benghazi.Joe Klein of Time, who spoke hawkishly on television before the Iraq invasion and became increasingly critical of the enterprise, is now a Libya skeptic: “If there’s one thing that we’ve learned in the last decade about invading Islamic countries,” it “is that there are always vast unintended consequences.”The fearless Christopher Hitchens, who has not wavered in his support for the Iraq war, argued on Slate that the uprising in Libya vindicates the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. “Can anyone imagine how the Arab spring would have played out if a keystone Arab state, oil-rich and heavily armed with a track record of intervention in its neighbors’ affairs and a history of all-out mass-repression against its own civilians, were still the private property of a sadistic crime family?” Hitchens wrote.George Packer, who eloquently agonized over his early support for the Iraq war in “The Assassins’ Gate,” has somewhat reluctantly saddled up again for Libya, although he has little faith in the motley rebel alliance. He argues that the strategic stakes are high and the threat of massacre was imminent, but you can almost hear him sighing in resignation: “Any fixed abstract guidelines will perish against the reality of new circumstances,” he wrote on The New Yorker’s Web site.As editor of The Times, I don’t take stands for or against wars, old ones in Iraq or new ones in Libya, lest my opinions be mistaken for the guiding doctrine of our news coverage. But it’s fair to say the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan underscores the value of a certain humility about our ability to shape history.President Obama’s first major venture into the Middle East, his remarkable June 2009 speech at Cairo University, had a robust missionary flavor, promoting reconciliation, tolerance, human rights and freedom long before anyone seriously imagined an Arab spring.But it’s understandable that throughout these recent months, torn between clamorous certainties — the cheerleaders for intervention and the alarmists about the threat of turmoil in the Arab world — the president has projected a wary ambivalence. He has tossed aside allied autocrats in Egypt and Yemen, urged reform and restraint on others and backed an armed intervention in Libya that seems to be creeping inexorably from atrocity prevention to regime change. Yet he has moved more slowly and sounded more equivocal than democracy hawks would like. His March speech on Libya, describing it as a limited, one-of-a-kind intervention, seemed to elevate the absence of doctrine to a doctrine.For taking the long view, India is not a bad vantage point from which to watch the serial eruptions in the Arab world. India is 64 years into its own democratic experiment, which began with the partition of this former imperial colony into India and Pakistan. Liberation begat a bloody breakdown of law and order, followed by — in addition to economic growth and pockets of immense wealth — wars, sectarian atrocities and nuclear saber-rattling, grand and petty corruption, enduring poverty and disillusionment.India is a caution that, from the on-ramp, it’s hard to see your destination.'"
"'11-04-17,'0','It seems to me there are two ways of understanding the document assembled from a jumble of boxes, disks and printed or handwritten papers that, at the time of David Foster Wallace’s suicide in 2008, ran into the high hundreds of pages — a document that, conscientiously and intelligently whittled down by Wallace’s editor Michael Pietsch to 500-odd pages, is now being published under the title “The Pale King,” and, just as significantly, the subtitle “An Unfinished Novel.”The first is as a coherent, if incomplete, portrayal of our age unfolding on an epic scale: a grand parable of postindustrial culture or “late capitalism,” and an anguished examination of the lot of the poor (that is, white-collar) individual who finds himself caught in this system’s mesh. The setting that Wallace has chosen as his background (and foreground, and pretty much everything in between) could not be more systematic: the innards of the Internal Revenue Service — the sheer, overwhelming heft of its protocols and procedures. If, as one of Wallace’s characters asserts, “the world of men as it exists today is a bureaucracy,” then the I.R.S., “a system composed of many systems,” not only represents that world but also furnishes the ultimate stage on which its moral dramas are enacted. In the words of Midwest Regional Examination Center Director DeWitt Glendenning Jr., one of the more shadowy (or pale) presences in this ­multicharactered and multivoiced book, “The tax code, once you get to know it, embodies all the essence of [human] life: greed, politics, power, goodness, charity.”To its own agents and enforcers, the I.R.S. even offers a role and status akin to that of the lone, righteous gunslinger in the Wild West or the caped crusader in Gotham. “Enduring tedium over real time in a confined space is what real courage is,” accounting students are informed with evangelical zeal by their instructor. “To retain care and scrupulosity about each detail from within the teeming wormball of data and rule and exception and contingency which constitutes real-world accounting — this is heroism.” The proposition is comic (one of the novel’s would-be heroes practices saying “Freeze! Treasury!” in front of his mirror) but sincere as well: the instructor is a Jesuit priest, and the scene is redacted with a genuinely epiphanic air. In a universe of veiled and veiling numbers, the task of drawing the true ones out into the light and holding them up for inspection, clear and remainder-­less, really is a sacred one. “Gentlemen,” the instructor rounds off his sermon by saying, “you are called to account.”The problem, as I.R.S. recruits soon discover, is that neither moral nor heroic codes hold true anymore. The bulk of “The Pale King” takes place in the mid-1980s, as the Spackman Initiative is being implemented. Pure invention (as far as I can tell) on Wallace’s part, the initiative nonetheless describes an all too recognizable shift in administrative culture, with the supplanting of a public service ethos (tax enforcement is an affirmation of all citizens’ duties toward others) by a free-­market one: the I.R.S. is a revenue-­generating business and, as such, should audit only those returns that promise the highest yield-to-man-hour-spent-­investigating ratio. Post-Spackman, the tax agency is a godless space whose commandments are simply those of the profit motive, and whose driving logic is being automated at an alarming pace thanks to emerging software. “It was frightening,” writes David Wallace (a character who shares his name not only with the author but also with another David Wallace at the I.R.S., causing yet further blurring of identities and voices), “like watching an enormous machine come to consciousness and start trying to think and feel like a real human.” Machines will never feel, of course; nor do they allow for human agency and its offshoots (free will, ethics, compassion, love) to unfold and blossom in their arid data fields. By the time the software’s up and running, those high up in the I.R.S. are questioning the very need for humans to administer its programs at all.Thus, by backtracking to the “Flint­stonianly remote” era of mainframe computers, tape-and-card-based data storage and so on, Wallace identifies a watershed moment, a kind of base layer in the archaeology of the present — rather like Thomas Pynchon tracing the origins of the 1970s to 1945 in “Gravity’s Rainbow.” There’s a lot of Pynchon in “The Pale King,” in fact: the I.R.S.’s deployment of agents gifted with psychic powers, its harnessing of the occult for political ends, surely owe something to the White Visitation research facility in “Gravity’s Rainbow.” That ghosts roam the audit booths surprises none of Wallace’s characters; they even sit through lectures on the etymology of the word “boredom” given by spirits whose voices slip into and out of audibility against the Examination Center’s monotonous background hum. Like Wallace’s breakthrough novel, “Infinite Jest,” “The Pale King” is pervaded by an air of melancholia, an acute sense of loss. Nostalgic images of childhood lakes and ponds, since algaed or cemented over, crop up repeatedly. There’s a dead father, who, like James Incandenza in “Infinite Jest,” met a baroque end before the novel’s outset (dragged to his death along a subway platform through a jumble of Christmas shopping bags, the clutter and paraphernalia of consumerism). There’s lingering teenage depression everywhere. Wallace could be called an “adolescent” writer: one whose characters, like the worlds they inhabit, find themselves in states of transition, prone to all the awkwardness this entails. David Wallace (the character) is cursed with awful acne; another figure has a propensity to sweat profusely. I don’t use the term pejoratively here — far from it: adolescence is about being trapped in bodies, in between, half-formed. It’s Gregor Samsa’s state.And then, perhaps, there’s a MacGuffin, peeping through this networked novel like James Incandenza’s lethally seductive film through “Infinite Jest.” Agent Chris Fogle, it is rumored, has concocted an algorithm that bequeaths to those who intone it a state of pure, impenetrable concentration — and the I.R.S.’s chiefs, for obvious reasons, want to prize this from him. But the formula, rather than accelerating the system’s ends, might instead allow the semi-enslaved worker to slip his shackles even as he dons them, to achieve a kind of mystical, if beleaguered, enlightenment. The novel’s final image sends us back to a 19th-century factory, in which a woman counting loops of twine is shown enjoying Zen-like immersion in her task. A transcendent ergonomics of the assembly line is, perhaps, the best that we can hope for, Wallace seems to conclude.'"
"'11-04-17,'0','Tom McCarthy, whose brainy, high-concept novels include “Remainder” and “C,” was among the corps of early readers who seized on “Infinite Jest,” David Foster Wallace’s postmodern masterpiece.“I was completely seduced,” McCarthy told us in an e-mail exchange, “both conceptually and in a rawer, more 19th-century kind of way. The networked, systems-novel structure of the book was exhilarating and brilliantly realized, but I also found myself living with the people at the Enfield Tennis Academy for weeks on end. I’d have the weirdest dreams where I was hanging with a Hal and James Incandenza who were also Bart and Homer Simpson, and we were all the best of friends, coevals in this strange and correspondence-buzzing institutional space.”Reading Wallace’s unfinished posthumous novel, “The Pale King,” which he reviews on our cover this week, McCarthy remembered Borges’s observation that every writer is cursed to become his own worst imitator. “I think Wallace desperately wanted to avoid that,” he said, “while at the same time to advance a project he’d set in motion, to see it along its way, if not to its destination. And I think those are the terms on which you have to judge ‘The Pale King’: not on how it reads as a finished work (it doesn’t, it’s not) but rather on its fidelity to the trajectory of a huge imaginative enterprise that set itself vast and, ultimately, impossible goals — the only type worth having.”'"
"'11-04-17,'0','Indeed, they are so tightly clustered because the prospective students and their families who are their customers consider all four institution to be tops, and equal in prestige and quality.If my argument holds, then prices should reflect perceived quality, with emphasis on “perceived.” They do.Consider the pricing decision at universities just below the super-elites. To charge well below the acknowledged leaders might signal lower quality, not at all the message they wish to convey. So Duke ($40,575), Emory ($39,158), University of Southern California ($41,022), Notre Dame ($39,919), Cornell ($39,666) and Washington University in St. Louis ($40,374) price themselves right with or even slightly above the leaders.Tuition and fees at top liberal arts colleges — Pomona ($39,394), Amherst ($40,862) and Swarthmore ($39,600) — are similarly grouped.“Prestige” and “quality” are in the eyes of the beholder. Wannabes price themselves accordingly. Ursinus College acknowledged, when it sharply raised tuition, that it did so to build the perception of quality. Claremont McKenna, neighbor to Harvey Mudd College, where I served as president, raised its tuition when it realized it was gaining nothing by being priced below its competition.The fact that tuitions are set to five significant figures implies precise calculation. But pricing is a marketing, not a cost accounting, decision.My lunch companions protested: these are nonprofit colleges, not for-profit enterprises.But neither, said I, are they expense-minimizing enterprises.Administrators strive to avoid losing money, while achieving only a small excess of revenue over expenses. Once tuition is set, costs are controlled — or permitted to grow — to match the maximum revenues each institution believes it can get. One assumption is safe: colleges spend all they can get their hands on. No administrator or faculty member I know is short of ideas on how to spend more.Consider the cost of educating students at two liberal arts colleges with similar missions, Pomona and Earlham.For 2009-10, Earlham reports having spent about $40,650 for each of 1,113 full-time equivalent students. Pomona spent just under $77,420 per student, with 1,540 full-time equivalencies. Though its tuition is less than 10 percent higher than Earlham’s, Pomona manages to spend almost twice as much.Now, Earlham’s rural Indiana location is unlike Pomona’s suburban Southern California location, but geography doesn’t begin to explain the difference.Could Earlham — current tuition and fees: $36,694 — charge a lot more? Probably not. For all its fine qualities, it is not perceived as a top-tier college, and the market likely would not bear it. Could Pomona charge more? Yes. But it could also charge less — and spend less.Interestingly, if Pomona’s per-student spending were the same as Earlham’s, it could charge zero tuition and not even have to draw 5 percent from its endowment (a typical annual payout rate).But why should Pomona spend less as long as the market continues to bear the current rate?Well-endowed institutions lament that even their high tuitions cover only half the cost of educating undergraduates.Here’s a question for another luncheon engagement: Institutions may be able to spend twice the amount of tuition, but do they need to spend so much? If Ponoma spent the same as Earlham, faculty members might have to teach more than two courses a semester, and dorms and recreational centers would be less luxurious. Of course, not all of this spending is trivial. Spending less means financial aid policies would be less generous and the student body therefore less diverse and stellar.As sticker prices have increased, so has scholarship aid offered. In effect, prices are discounted just sufficiently to “clear the market” — match supply and demand — for the students the college wishes to enroll. Many of these scholarships are financed through tuitions paid by wealthier students. To date, parents don’t seem to be rebelling against these Robin Hood activities.But those responsible for setting tuitions at prestigious universities have for years worried that they might soon hit the wall — that is, price themselves out of the market. Perhaps there isn’t an upper limit, or wall, or perhaps that worry has less to do with what a family can afford than with perceptions of price gouging and frivolous spending.With the demand for top-end colleges and universities only growing, and a finite supply of slots, my bet is that tuitions will continue for some time to rise at a pace well above inflation.Rich institutions will get richer, dishing out more financial aid, hiring the best teachers, receiving more gifts, amassing bigger endowments and building more fancy rec centers.The rate of increase in the number of applications in recent years has been more than double that of tuition increases. Obviously, the “buyers” believe that the extra investment in tuition has a positive return on investment.Thus: Who is to blame for escalating tuitions, the “suppliers” of higher education or the “demanders”? Check, please.'"

"'11-04-18,'0','BOSTON — Despite all the miscues, Carmelo Anthony still had the chance to go from goat to hero with a flick of his wrist. Anthony’s reputation is of a basketball closer, one who takes the last shot with no conscience, regardless of whether he made his previous few shots.He needed that mentality with the way the Knicks’ playoff series opener against the Celtics was going. Anthony gathered, steadied and squared after Ray Allen’s 3-pointer gave the Celtics a 2-point lead in the closing seconds of Boston’s 87-85 victory on Sunday. His final shot from 25 feet clanged off the rim as the game ended, completing his dismal Knicks playoff debut and cementing a lost opportunity for the Knicks to win their first playoff game in a decade.Anthony’s demeanor after the game reflected his confidence and not his final statistics.“I had a chance to make a 3, I missed it,” Anthony said in a demeanor that suggested the shot and the game were already behind him. “They didn’t do nothing special. They won Game 1 here on their home court. They did what they’re supposed to do, and now we have another shot at it.”Still, the Knicks will need better from Anthony to even the series when Game 2 is played Tuesday in Boston. Anthony has often been the one to take the Knicks’ final shot (as well as their first), and he came through with game-winners against Indiana and Memphis in the regular season. Boston is already trained on defending the league’s best isolation players, a trait left over from the former assistant Tom Thibodeau’s tenure and gained from meeting Kobe Bryant in the N.B.A. finals two of the last three years.The Celtics loaded whichever side Anthony was roaming, limiting him to 5-for-18 shooting for 15 points in a sporadic 34 minutes. It was Anthony’s lowest point output in the playoffs since he scored 15 points and took 16 shots in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers two years ago. In the next game, Anthony rebounded with 31 points.'"

"'11-04-18,'0','In the book, Mr. Allen quotes from a letter he wrote to Mr. Gates in June 1982, explaining why he planned to leave Microsoft. “Over the years,” Mr. Allen wrote in the letter, “the result of these and other incidents has been the gradual destruction of both our friendship and our ability to work together.”Later that year, Mr. Allen was told that he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and while he was successfully treated, Mr. Allen resigned as a Microsoft employee in February 1983. That was less than eight years after the company was founded, and three years before Microsoft became a public company in 1986. Still, by 1983, Microsoft was well on its way to becoming a powerhouse company in the PC era.“We had an amazing friendship and an amazing partnership,” Mr. Allen said in the interview on Friday. “That unraveled at Microsoft.”Yet, as the book makes clear, the friendship was mended over time. When Mr. Allen was again struck with cancer in 2009, Mr. Gates was one of his most frequent visitors. “He was everything you’d want from a friend, caring and concerned,” Mr. Allen writes.Their friendship was forged over many years, beginning at Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, where they met and first encountered computing, on a time-sharing terminal there linked to a mainframe miles away.The book is filled with admiring observations about Mr. Gates, his intelligence, his intensity, even his sense of humor. The two men, Mr. Allen writes, have seen about 500 movies together. At Lakeside, Mr. Allen recounts a senior-year assignment to write essays about those “near and dear to me.” In the book, Mr. Allen quotes from the essay he wrote about Mr. Gates. It ends, “We fit together very well.”Indeed, Mr. Allen describes his years at Microsoft as being “like a failed romance. Parts of the relationship had been wonderful, but I remembered the negatives, too.”But bonds, if loosened, remained. Mr. Allen was a member of the Microsoft board until 2000, and Mr. Gates invited Mr. Allen to his wedding in 1994. Mr. Allen’s stake in the company made him immensely wealthy, worth an estimated $13.5 billion, enabling him to own two professional sports teams, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks, and finance ambitious research projects on artificial intelligence and mapping the brain.Mr. Allen said he still owned a “substantial,” though undisclosed, holding of Microsoft shares.Of his bitter feelings years ago, Mr. Allen said, “I got over it. And then we went on. I think we’ve both mellowed.”Mr. Allen sent Mr. Gates, and several others from the early Microsoft days, copies of his book. Mr. Gates issued a statement when the excerpt appeared in Vanity Fair, saying his recollection of incidents described in the book differed from Mr. Allen’s, but that he still valued Mr. Allen’s friendship and his contributions to Microsoft.The book’s title, “Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-Founder of Microsoft” (Portfolio/Penguin), captures Mr. Allen’s view of his role. His ideas, according to the book, included recognizing that the early microprocessors of the 1970s could run software for a general-purpose PC, naming the company and creating the two-button mouse (Apple’s had a single button; the Xerox PARC Alto used a three-button model).Steve Wood, employee No. 6 at Microsoft, said Mr. Allen’s contributions had probably not been widely recognized, largely because he left so early and Microsoft became huge and powerful later, when Mr. Gates personified Microsoft. The precise role of each man is “a very subjective thing” and “very context-dependent,” said Mr. Wood, who has read the book.“But clearly, Microsoft would never have happened without both of them,” Mr. Wood said.Another early employee who read the book said he thought the “Batman and Robin” portrayal was “particularly unfair to Bill.” The person, who asked not to be named because of his friendship with both men, said Mr. Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to found Microsoft, is a self-trained computer scientist, who wrote most of the company’s first product, Microsoft Basic (Mr. Allen wrote the programming development tools).“Time and again, Bill was the one who made it happen,” the person said.'"
"'11-04-18,'0','Several of those involved with negotiating for the show suggested that NBC could order an additional cycle of “The Apprentice” to begin in September. But that would be immediately threatened if Mr. Trump entered the race. He said in an interview last week that he might use the show’s live finale on May 22 to announce a news conference a few days later, at which he would reveal his intentions.Many political commentators have dismissed Mr. Trump’s chances and have chalked up recent favorable poll results mainly to name recognition — and to his aggressive insistence that he doubts President Obama’s eligibility to be president. Still, doubts of another kind persist.“Anyone assuming that the reality show host’s interest in running for president is just another one of his publicity stunts would not likely be wrong,” wrote Charlie Cook, the political analyst, who in a column last week wondered whether a “Jersey Shore” cast member would try to run for president next.Mr. Trump’s statements that he is considering a presidential run have presented a more immediate issue for the news division of NBC. He has remained in the news by giving seemingly daily television interviews and making incendiary statements, many of which have been challenged and contradicted.One such interview by NBC News came under scrutiny by television critics because Mr. Trump made several statements that had previously been debunked (about Mr. Obama’s birth certificate) without being corrected by the interviewer, Meredith Vieira, though she did challenge him on some points.Mr. Trump said in the interview that Mr. Obama’s “grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, O.K.?” That is a favorite talking point among people who doubt whether Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii, but it has been widely discredited; the full version of the audiotape of that conversation makes clear that the grandmother says the president was born in Hawaii.“NBC Nightly News” and “Today” subsequently broadcast a fact-checking segment about several of Mr. Trump’s claims in the interview. Asked via e-mail whether Mr. Trump’s employment by NBC Entertainment affects news coverage, as some critics have questioned, the “Today” show’s executive producer, Jim Bell, said that “Mr. Trump’s work on a show that airs on NBC does not affect NBC News coverage of him, and it’s silly to suggest otherwise.”Mr. Bell noted that in a recent poll of likely Republican primary voters by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump came in second, behind Mitt Romney. “He’s a potential candidate,” Mr. Bell said. In other polls, Mr. Trump has been first.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s “Apprentice” continues to perform well on NBC, drawing more than eight million viewers each week, making it one of the network’s most-watched shows. If he decides to formally seek the nomination, NBC would be compelled to rethink any plans for a fall season of the program.Networks do their best to avoid the thicket of the equal-time rule, which obligates television and radio stations to offer equivalent time to competing candidates if one gets free airtime.In recent years, the provision has affected cable news channels when they have had potential candidates on their staffs as commentators. But entertainers have also been caught up in equal time incidents in the past.Notably, when Fred D. Thompson entered the race for the Republican nomination in 2008, he quit his role on the NBC series “Law & Order,” and just to be safe, NBC stopped broadcasting re-runs in which Mr. Thompson appeared.The three executives who would be involved in talks to renew “The Apprentice” said several possibilities had been discussed.One said a new season of the series could be taped this summer, then held until Mr. Trump’s fate in the primaries — or the general election — was decided.Or NBC and the show could substitute a different host for Mr. Trump. It was once the long-term plan to introduce new bosses to run the game. But Mr. Trump proved to have more star appeal than any other likely contender, a fact he has taken glee in noting.One option would place three of Mr. Trump’s children, all of whom already act as his seconds on the show, at the center of “The Apprentice” in his absence. But executives at NBC worry that even a solution that puts noncandidate Trumps on the air for three months might lead to a demand for equivalent time from another candidate, or his or her children.'"
"'11-04-18,'0','HELSINKI, Finland (AP) — Finnish voters on Sunday dealt a blow to Europe’s plans to rescue Portugal and other debt-ridden economies, ousting the pro-bailout government and giving a major lift to a nationalist party skeptical of bailouts and the euro zone.With all ballots counted, the biggest winner was the conservative National Coalition Party, part of the outgoing center-right government and a strong advocate for European integration.But its main ally, the Center Party, led by Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi, said it would drop out of the government after falling behind two opposition parties that have challenged bailouts of euro zone countries: The anti-immigration True Finns do not believe Finland should rescue Europe’s “squanderers,” while the Social Democrats have called for changes to how those countries are financed.The outcome means that the National Coalition leader, Jyrki Katainen, will have to invite at least one of the parties to coalition talks, raising questions about Finland’s support for rescue packages that need unanimous approval in the 17-member euro zone.“This result will give Europe gray hairs,” said Olavi Borg, a political analyst. “It will cause them problems over the bailout funds.”If any country pulled out, the system would crash, leading to a worsening of the debt crisis at a time when the group is deciding whether bailouts will end with Portugal or will also be needed for larger economies like Spain’s or Italy’s.'"
"'11-04-18,'0','Ten sets of human remains have turned up in the thick brush off Ocean Parkway on the South Shore of Long Island since December. All of them have been discovered by the police. Five of them were found by the same officer and his partner.The officer, John Mallia, a 31-year veteran of the Suffolk County Police Department and a former private investigator, is good at finding the things and people that are the hardest to find, like inmates who have escaped from the county jail. His partner is even better at it: Blue, a German shepherd, has worked with Officer Mallia since 2005.Through some combination of tenacity, luck, canine sensory skill and mathematical probabilities, Officer Mallia and his police dog have played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in the search for a serial killer and perhaps other killers, discovering the remains along the same remote stretch of road.At least two of the searches of a nearby beach community were done on their own time.Blue has gotten scratched up in the overgrown terrain north of the parkway near Oak Beach, and so has his handler, who has gotten poison ivy from the work.“When he’s tracking, he’s relentless,” Inspector Stuart K. Cameron, commander of the Suffolk department’s special patrol bureau, said of Officer Mallia. “He’ll work and work and work. That’s what happened at Oak Beach. His persistence is what led to the discovery of that first body.”'"
"'11-04-18,'0','Cisco came as ready for the challenge as any predecessor. It dominates the complex and demanding world of digital networking; in under 30 years, it has grown to be one of the largest companies in the world, with a market capitalization larger than Goldman Sachs, McDonald’s or Ford. At the time it acquired Flip, Cisco was said to have cash reserves of more than $29 billion.But surely Cisco must have seen that the road to the consumer market is paved with the corpses of the fallen.In 1995, for instance, the computer modem maker U.S. Robotics bought Palm, the maker of personal digital assistants. In the ensuing years, Palm was passed from U.S. Robotics to its new parent, 3Com, and then to its current owner, Hewlett-Packard. In the meantime, Palm, once a market leader, watched competitors like Apple, Google and Research In Motion carve up the smartphone market.As Cisco hoped in its acquisition of Flip, each of Palm’s parents hoped that the smaller company’s innovations would bring fame and fortune to the entire organization. The parent company would no longer just be a business — it would be a brand. Its executives would be minor (or even major) celebrities. Perhaps the stock price would get a healthy bump.“It’s a little tough when all the money and energy is over in the consumer space,” said an industry analyst, Mark Anderson. “If you’re on the enterprise side of things, you want some of that.”I.B.M. was perhaps the most successful crossover artist, moving from mainframe to personal computing with the PC in the early 1980s.But even that success was the exception that proves the rule. I.B.M. had to set up an autonomous division in Florida, far from corporate headquarters in New York, to give the PC room to grow. “The only way the PC was going to be developed was if it got out from under I.B.M.’s bureaucracy,” said the business historian John Steele Gordon. “That the PC succeeded at all was not because of I.B.M.’s corporate culture, but in spite of it.” (It is worth noting that Microsoft’s Xbox was developed in a similar fashion.)Even I.B.M.’s move into the consumer space came to an end. The computing giant sold its PC group to Lenovo in 2005.Acquiring or building a consumer business and successfully integrating it into the larger, existing enterprise company is challenging, says Mr. Zolli, the consultant. “Companies acquire consumer businesses for perceived synergies,” he said. “But the synergies are almost always illusory. These corporate marriages bring all the emotional baggage of a shotgun wedding.”In 2008, Microsoft bought Danger, a small company that made a cellphone called the Sidekick. The Sidekick had already attained an enviable level of popularity in the much sought-after youth market. Microsoft integrated the Danger team into the group developing the Kin, a Sidekick-like device that Microsoft was hoping would have the same appeal to teenagers and young adults. The Kin was released in May of last year; 48 days later, Microsoft removed it from the market, a remarkably public admission of failure.Companies with a long history of leading a double life — one selling to consumers, one selling to other businesses — sometimes come to the conclusion that the charade is no longer worth sustaining. In January, after 82 years selling to consumers as well as businesses, Motorola split in two. Motorola Solutions would continue making and selling commercial-grade telecommunications systems, while Motorola Mobility would work on consumer-focused products like the Xoom tablet and Atrix smartphone.“We recognized that we had strong businesses that could better achieve their full potential as separate entities,” said Marc Rothman, Motorola Mobility’s chief financial officer. “We’ve streamlined our business to focus on our core consumer base.”Susan Fournier, a business professor at Boston University, says it is important for companies to realize what they are good at and what they are not. She points to Procter & Gamble’s sale earlier this month of Pringles, the company’s sole remaining food brand, as an example of that clarity. “P.& G. is as good a consumer company as there has ever been,” Professor Fournier said, “and part of that is because they are relentlessly focused. When Pringles no longer fit into their strategy, they got rid of it.”Changing a company’s direction midstream — or adding a new direction — is a challenge of the highest order. “You have to take your pick before you start your company,” said Mr. Anderson, the analyst. “You don’t do it later.”And yet companies are likely to continue to charge into the consumer market, even if they have no experience there. Part of the impulse may be market-driven. “The stock market covets growth,” Professor Fournier said. “So you build a company to grow it. To grow it, you eventually have to go outside your boundaries.”Then there is the matter of personal glory. “I think hubris may have a lot to do with it,” said Mr. Gordon, the historian. Many chief executives give an order that sounds simple but is anything but: “Go out and buy me the next iPhone.”'"
"'11-04-18,'0','The decision to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy has sent ripples through the country’s major orchestras, many of which are struggling with money. Several, like Philadelphia, are also facing contract negotiations with their musicians. Allison Vulgamore, the Philadelphia Orchestra’s president and chief executive, sent a memo last week to executives of other major orchestras alerting them to Saturday’s vote.While orchestras have resorted to bankruptcy court in the past, none have been of the caliber of the Fabulous Philadelphians — an internationally famous ensemble that was the first American orchestra to visit China and counts Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy as past music directors. It is as much a national treasure as a local one.The orchestra said that it had cash to pay the bills for only two more months and that the gap this season between what it has to pay to operate and what it earns is $13 million. Emergency fund-raising is expected to bring that down to $5 million, management officials said, but that would cover only this season.The trustees voted overwhelmingly in favor of a filing, with only the five musicians on the board opposing. The musicians contend that management is exaggerating the situation and that filing for bankruptcy will undermine the orchestra’s quality and discourage donors.After the vote, Ms. Vulgamore said the board felt heavily the weight of tradition. “But we also talked about wanting to see our future and taking the necessary steps to get there to it.”She said the musicians would still be paid and concerts would continue, but the orchestra would review all contracts with its business partners — especially the Kimmel Center, where it pays rent. It will come up with a reorganization plan to be approved by a bankruptcy judge and will continue to negotiate with the musicians over a new contract.Richard Worley, the board’s chairman, said in an interview that the orchestra hoped to emerge from Chapter 11 “by later this year.” He said the atmosphere during the vote was emotional. “Not every eye was dry throughout the morning.”John Koen, a cellist and chairman of the players committee, spoke from the stage on Saturday, thanking the audience members for their support and announcing that the musicians would offer a special expression of gratitude: the heart-warming “Nimrod” movement from Elgar’s “Enigma” Variations. Its mood reflected a more hopeful outcome than another work on the program — music from Berg’s opera “Lulu,” in which the protagonist dies a tawdry death at the hands of Jack the Ripper.'"

"'11-04-19,'1','It first drew attention and criticism by creating and selling preparation materials for the exams used for private school admission and for public schools’ gifted programs. Widespread test preparation, aided by Aristotle Circle and its competitors, has been cited as the reason for a rapid improvement in student scores on certain intelligence tests.George Davison, head of school at Grace Church School in Greenwich Village, said he saw the test scores of applicants to his school this year rise 15 percent from the year before, which he attributed to preparation services. As a result, the school now gives less weight to the test.He is skeptical about the business of offering insider advice at high prices.“For some people, if you get 1 percent marginally better information, and you pay 2,000 percent more for it, it’s worth it,” he said. “I don’t think you get value for your money.”Suzanne Rheault, one of Aristotle Circle’s founders, said she saw no difference between the materials she sells for up to $499 and the expensive preschools that spend months shaping up 4-year-olds for the tests. “It’s being gamed all over the city,” Ms. Rheault said. “We wanted to demystify it.”She has gone beyond those test-prep books to build what she calls an “expert network” of more than 200 admissions consultants who can advise students or parents applying to preschool, prep school, college and graduate school. Aristotle takes a 20 to 50 percent commission on the fees, which range from $150 to $500 an hour.Similar services can be found with a few keystrokes, and a parent can always seek out a consultant without using an intermediary. But Ms. Rheault also advertises a handful of consultants, like the one the Manhattan mother hired, who are current employees or officials of private schools and colleges and who are moonlighting to help parents navigate the process.These consultants are required to sign contracts stating that they will avoid conflicts of interest, and must not lobby or advocate for a client. Ms. Rheault said she would not match a current employee of a school with a parent of a child applying to that school; the board member she connected to the mother is not an employee.But she also allows them to remain anonymous, even to the clients hiring them, and it is up to the consultant to abide by the restrictions on advocacy.On its Web site, the company boasts that it has insiders at some of the city’s most prestigious schools, including Horace Mann, Dalton, Chapin and Collegiate. Patricia T. Hayot, head of school at Chapin, said, “I could not imagine that that’s happening in our school.” Officials of the other schools either declined to comment or did not respond.At schools including Grace Church and Trinity, any outside admissions consulting is prohibited. “We have rules about outside income: You have to declare it and it has to reach a smell test,” said Mr. Davison, of Grace Church. “I wouldn’t allow it,” he said.It is up to the consultants to decide whether to disclose their activities to their schools. Murr LeBey, an Aristotle consultant who is a former associate director of admissions at the Little Red School House, said that most would not.“For people currently working for a school,” Ms. LeBey said, “it probably wouldn’t be optimal for the school for them to be talking about the school or the admissions process for the school.”'"
"'11-04-19,'1','But the fireworks on the pages of “Idea Man” are relatively minimal. And Mr. Gates is barely even mentioned in the book’s second half. The major part of this memoir is about how the until now very mysterious Mr. Allen, whose important childhood memories include the time when “Willard Libby, the inventor of carbon dating, poured liquid nitrogen over my hand,” found himself in a position to indulge his inner teenage boy throughout his adult life. Space ships, science fiction, movies, sports and guitars have been among the many, many formative passions that he has indulged to the max.“Idea Man” is unusually selective about the parts of Mr. Allen’s story that it chooses to tell. Not for nothing has he managed to finance so many high-profile enterprises yet avoid public exposure. One example of a redacted realm: women in his life, if there were any. Mr. Allen describes watching the launching of one of his pet rockets with Richard Branson, who has also had a financial interest in space tourism.“Paul,” Mr. Branson asked, “isn’t this better than the best sex you ever had?” The answer, which Mr. Allen thought but did not say aloud: “If I was this anxious during any kind of interpersonal activity, I couldn’t enjoy it very much.”The inclusion of that anecdote in “Idea Man” is of course a deliberate choice. (So is the exclusion of the 1998 lawsuit filed against Mr. Allen for sexual harassment. It was dismissed by a judge in Los Angeles in 1999.) But other parts of his story are weirdly, revealingly un-self-conscious. Anything having to do with the effect of his fortune on celebrities is eyebrow-raising, like Mr. Allen’s story about how he played “Satisfaction” with Ronnie Wood at a birthday party for Mick Jagger’s 56th birthday at the Cannes Film Festival. Mr. Jagger, he says, could not resist singing along.Incidentally, Mr. Allen says that the first question Mr. Jagger ever asked him was about garden design. “He was landscaping his place in France,” Mr. Allen explains, “and wanted to do it right.”“Idea Man” includes many such moments. But it is primarily a book about the advance of technology, and about Mr. Allen’s truly forward-thinking, sometimes staggeringly important innovations. He and Mr. Gates were present for the birth of the desktop personal computer. And when such computers were strictly for hobbyists (who, according to Mr. Allen, had to make more than 1,000 solder connections to assemble the kit for an Altair 8800, which arrived in 1975 as the Ford Model T of the Internet Age), Mr. Allen was there to answer phone questions from befuddled customers.Now, he says, “here’s what the death knell for the personal computer will sound like: ‘Mainly I use my phone/pad, but I still use my PC to write long e-mails and documents.’ Most people aren’t there yet, but that’s where we’re headed.”In light of that sense of doom, Mr. Allen has criticism for the way Microsoft and Google, among other Internet giants, conduct their business. And, once again selectively, he mentions that Interval Research, one of the many companies he founded, “developed several potentially groundbreaking ideas and registered about 300 patents (some of which may turn out to be quite valuable).” He does not mention that he sued Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix and eBay, among others, for patent infringement last year.“Idea Man” is long overdue. It turns out to be as remote, yet as surpassingly strange, as its author, whose receipt of a diagnosis of Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2009 has made it that much more important for him to tell his story. Though it is written in the smoothly proficient style of many a collaborator-assisted memoir, it is a book filled with wild extremes: breakthrough, breakup, power, indulgence, blue-sky innovation. And it winds up offering Mr. Allen’s guarded, partial answer to a universal question: what if you could make your wildest dreams come true?'"
"'11-04-19,'1','Each of these works blooms with a spirit of invention nurtured by limited means and an improvisational readiness to make a stage wherever you find it. And while they are all, to different degrees, examples of documentary theater, their style is hardly confined to representational realism. This is a troupe, after all, that makes firecrackers out of shoelaces. Imagine what they do with a crate of oranges, or two balloons, or a chalkboard, or a bag of potatoes.The spirit is also that of youthful rebellion, an instinct traced virtually to the cradle in “Childhood Legends,” the first of the three parts of “Zone.” Partly adapted from the experiences of troupe members, and directed by Vladimir Shcherban, “Legends” portrays a series of young lives flickering, guttering and occasionally rising into flame. The stories told are on one level universal: tales of humiliation and punishment by stern teachers, of unrequited early loves, of bewildering visits to sick grown-ups in hospitals.From these mostly first-person accounts there emerges a particular, fine-grained sense of a gray world of deprivation within an imprisoning infrastructure inconceivable to most Americans. Suicide, which figures in two of these stories, is an understandable choice.The telling, though, is never merely solemn or pious. Robust satire is in evidence, particularly in the portrayal of a teacher leading her charges in the national anthem. So is a deep love of craft, never so striking as in a vignette in which a doomed little girl (the real-life subject of a widely reported attempted adoption by an Italian couple) is shaped into physical existence by the artisanal skill and empathy of four actors with four newspapers.Empathy, and its power to transform, infuses “Diversity,” the second act of “Zone,” a vibrant collage of portraits of Belarusians on the margins of society. Based on interviews with the people embodied here, they include a guitarist (and onetime Russian mafia member) with no arms, a mentally ill gay man of mixed race, an anachronistic worshiper of the Communist Party (who believes she speaks the language of birds and dogs) and a ranting street performer, who says he is the best dancer in the universe.At the end of each segment, photographs or video footage of the real people behind the stories are shown. Contrary to what often occurs with such juxtapositions, you don’t feel that the live performances have been caricatures. And when the entire ensemble dances in sync with the filmed image of the street busker, it’s an act of strangely joyous spiritual communion.“Numbers,” the third part of “Zone,” is a succession of pantomime sketches linked to harrowing statistics about life in Belarus. And I think it’s safe to say that you have never seen grim, dry statistics illustrated with such a bright mixture of wit, anger and animation.The sections of “Zone” inform and enrich one another, creating a collective, layered portrait of a society. (Like much first-rate journalism, this show translates hard facts into fluid, mutable life, and vice versa.) “Discover Love,” written and directed by Nikolai Khalezin, is more conventional in that it traces the course of a single life within that society. Irina Krasovskaya is the widow of Anatoly Krasovsky, a pro-democracy businessman who disappeared, along with the opposition politician Viktor Gonchar, in 1999.The play includes direct statements (in voice-over and projected titles) that define “enforced disappearance” as a state-sanctioned crime (condemned by the United Nations), and video and photographic projections of protests against disappearances throughout the world. But its heart is the love story between Irina (played by the wonderful Marina Yurevich) and Tolia (Oleg Sidorchik).This is mostly Irina’s narrative, her sentimental education in what love is or could be. We hear of her relationship with the handsome father she meets only three times in her life, of her girlhood crushes at school, of the sense of never having a fixed home. These reminiscences are flavored with the taste of potential happiness, as in her accounts of the exotic wonder of going to the circus.And when Irina falls in love with Tolia, who had been her physics teacher, Ms. Yurevich and Mr. Sidorchik dance a tango that is truly happiness in motion. Such heights of pleasure are unsustainable, of course, and the early years of their marriage are a steady drone of merely subsisting. But as Tolia’s business grows, their relationship has room to breathe again. In a heart-clutching moment, Irina describes how, during a visit to Moscow to study, she calls her husband and starts crying, because she realizes that for the first time, she was able to call a place that she knew as home.So when Tolia disappears — and this production imagines what happened to him in merciless detail — it’s not just the enormity of the crime that strikes us. It is also the vastness of what has been lost. Darkness is always more intense when you have glimpsed the sun. Much of the force of this invaluable troupe lies in its awareness that the light beyond the dark may be unreachable, but that it exists, tragically tantalizing, nonetheless.'"
"'11-04-19,'1','Mr. Withiam added that travelers were expecting trip-related services to be available on the new platforms. PhoCusWright, a travel research firm, has found that 13 percent of social-network users now shop for travel on those Web sites and 35 percent of mobile-phone users expect to book travel on their phones in the next year.Axses Systems Caribbean, a company in Barbados, has helped about 30 small hotels and chains in Barbados and nearby make their reservations available on Facebook since early 2009. Ian Clayton, the chief executive of Axses, said he hoped that by offering reservations directly, while customers were excited by the property, his hotel clients would lose fewer bookings to online travel sites.The online agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline among them — increased their share of total online hotel bookings to 46 percent last year from 41 percent in 2008, according to PhoCusWright. Douglas Quinby, senior director at the firm, attributed most of that increase to travelers’ greater price awareness and decreased business travel during the recession.While those travel agencies can be great assets for hotels — allowing them to sell more rooms and to sell those rooms at a lower price without diminishing the hotel’s brand image — there are multiple drawbacks, Mr. Withiam said. Hotels make less money for rooms sold through an online travel agency than if customers had booked directly. Those customers may also start to think about meeting their travel needs through the online agency, rather than through the hotel, becoming in essence a customer with a relationship to the booking Web site and not the hotel.Trump Hotel Collection has been offering Facebook reservations for around six months, and Ivanka Trump, executive vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, even has a booking widget on her personal Facebook page. Ms. Trump said her company had an advantage in social media because “we are a personality-driven brand.” She added, “When I tweet out a hotel special, a million people see it.” Once guests have made reservations though Facebook, Ms. Trump said a hotel “attaché” contacted them to complete a “dossier” of their personal preferences, like the newspapers they wanted delivered, in-room amenities they required or particular room temperatures.Jillian Carroll, a Facebook spokeswoman, said that the travel industry was a natural partner. “Travel is inherently social,” she said. Travelers have long asked their friends for hotel and restaurant recommendations, and then shared their impressions afterwards. In addition to making reservations, Ms. Carroll said, some travel-related companies used Facebook to respond to customer complaints, notify users of travel reviews posted by their friends or run sweepstakes to win a free hotel stay.To help the companies refine their pages, Facebook offers analytics showing the aggregate demographic information of the people who “Like” a particular page. Companies can also discover the time of day that receives the most engagement and which actions spur more people to press the Like button.Hotels are trying different ways to use the new media. Hyatt guests with smartphones can check in and check out with them. That means travelers can check in during the taxi ride from the airport and simply pick up keys at the front desk.Hilton Worldwide estimates that about 615,000 customers have downloaded its mobile apps. Along with the ability to make or modify a reservation, it has offered new services like meals that are ready when guests arrive.While at-your-fingertips booking and personalized service may be important to business travelers, there is no denying the bottom line. “All too often, travelers will leave a hotel Web site and look for a better rate in an online travel agency,” Mr. Clayton said. To entice customers to book directly via Facebook, some hotels are offering a guaranteed lowest price.Using Facebook and smartphone apps, hotels hope to deepen or regain the relationships they had with customers and to raise the quality of their experiences when they check in. Attracting guests to book directly in new ways is a win for the hotel, said Mr. Withiam, from a financial, customer relationship and brand perspective.'"
"'11-04-19,'1','Thomas G. Hungar, a lawyer for Microsoft, said that was a mistake. The proper standard, he said, was proof by a “preponderance of the evidence,” meaning that Microsoft should have had to prove only that the patent’s invalidity was more likely than not. That is the usual standard in civil suits. Using the heightened standard “makes no sense,” Mr. Hungar said, and “ensures the enforcement of invalid patents.”Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed. “It would be hard to argue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made sense to Cardozo.”In a 1934 decision, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo wrote that the presumption that patents were valid was “not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.” Mr. Hungar responded that the decision should apply only in limited circumstances that were not present in Microsoft’s challenge.Now it was Justice Elena Kagan’s turn to disagree. “If you read that opinion, no one would gather from that opinion the kinds of limits that you’re suggesting,” she said of the 1934 decision.Mr. Hungar went on to say that the patent law at issue in the case was not enacted until 1952, and did not require the heightened standard even if the 1934 opinion had.Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he was open to considering the statute a blank slate. “I’ll assume that the language is open enough in the history so that we could make what would be a change,” he said.But Justice Breyer said he was unsure whether and what change was warranted given the competing interests.He suggested two other possible approaches. One would be to have the officials in charge of making patent determinations reconsider their decisions.His second proposal was to ask juries to determine only “brute facts,” and leave to judges the ultimate determination of whether a patent is invalid.Seth P. Waxman, representing the Canadian firm, said the 1952 law codified early decisions requiring clear and convincing proof. He added that Congress’s failure to modify the law after more recent decisions imposing that heightened standard was evidence that it had “actively acquiesced” in the interpretation.Justice Antonin Scalia, who was acting as presiding justice, questioned that formulation. “It’s like passive activity, right?” he asked.The justices let Mr. Waxman speak without interruption for extended stretches, generally a good sign for that lawyer’s side.Mr. Waxman said the heightened standard was warranted because it should not be easy to attack a government decision that bestowed a property right like a patent.Justice Breyer said he understood “how important patents are and what a disaster it is to the person once they’re invalidated.”But he said there was another side to the question.“In today’s world,” Justice Breyer said, “where nobody really understands this technology very well, a worse disaster for the country is to have protection given to things that don’t deserve it because they act as a block on trade, they act as monopolies and they will tie the country up in individual monopolies that will raise prices to consumers.”Near the end of the argument in the case, Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited Partnership, No. 10-290, Justice Breyer still sounded frustrated.“What we’re trying to do is we’re trying to get a better tool, if possible, to separate the sheep from the goats,” he said. “And so what is that better tool?”'"
"'11-04-19,'1','You’ve no doubt experienced a temporary disruption in smell and taste while suffering from a cold or sinus infection. Try to imagine your life if the problem lasted indefinitely and you could no longer enjoy the flavor of an orange or chocolate or taste the difference between chicken and steak.But smell and taste disorders can affect more than the ability to “smell the roses” in life and toenjoy food. Also affected is the ability to detect and correct unpleasant smells, like body odor or a dirty diaper in need of changing. For people like professional cooks and firefighters, the problem can force an occupational switch.Most important, smell disorders can be downright dangerous for those who cannot detect the odor of smoke, burning or spoiled food, natural gas or other noxious aromas.While reliable statistics are hard to come by, several million Americans are thought to suffer from the major smell disorders: hyposmia, a reduced ability to detect certain odors; anosmia, an inability to detect any odors at all; or dysosmia, in which pleasant odors can smell foul or vice versa.Most people who think they have a taste disorder, usually because food has lost its flavor, turn out to have a smell problem, according to Richard M. Costanzo, a neurophysiologist at Virginia Commonwealth University. The smell disorders clinic there receives regular inquiries from distressed patients; one of them said his inability to taste food flavors was “a very life-altering experience, and most normal people cannot understand the impact it has on one’s life.”There are many common causes. In addition to viral infections like colds and flu, they include disorders of the nose (for example, polyps) or sinuses; injuries to the nose or head; medications like blood pressure drugs, antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering drugs, antidepressants and cancer chemotherapy; radiation therapy of the head and neck; exposure to toxins like formaldehyde and pesticides; smoking and alcohol abuse; diseases of the thyroid, kidneys, liver or pancreas; and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body disease, multiple sclerosis and various kinds of dementia.Half of all people with diabetes have a diminished sense of smell and taste, and 90 percent of those with Alzheimer’s disease have impaired smell capacity, Dr. DeVere said.By far the leading cause — and the one least often recognized — is advancing age. Whereas only 1 percent to 2 percent of young people are affected, a quarter of those over 55 and nearly two-thirds of those over 80 have a diminished sense of smell.But unlike vision or hearing loss, which is often apparent to others, if not to the afflicted person, a loss of smell sensitivity with age is often undetected because it occurs gradually. The result can be a diminished interest in food and gradual weight loss, or a tendency to over-season foods with salt or sugar, which may impair control of high blood pressure or diabetes, common problems in the elderly.Depending on the cause of a smell disorder, therapeutic possibilities include treatment with nasal decongestants, antihistamines, or antibiotics; surgery to remove nasal polyps; use of a nasal saline solution; correction of hormonal or nutrient deficiencies; and stopping smoking.Dr. DeVere said that over time smell disorders may gradually diminish in intensity, as his did. Nonetheless, Dr. Costanzo said: “We have to be fair to patients. There’s no magic bullet. Some smell problems are treatable, most are not.”Especially challenging are those that result from head injuries, whether minor or severe, that disrupt the function of the body’s smell receptors — olfactory nerve cells that lie outside the brain. These cells pick up odor molecules high in the nose and transmit scent messages to the brain’s olfactory bulb, he explained.A head blow can injure or tear olfactory nerves. Damaged olfactory nerve cells can regenerate, but don’t always reconnect properly in the brain. Dr. Costanzo and colleagues are working on grafts and transplants that may one day overcome current treatment limitations.While everyone should have working smoke detectors in their homes, a person with a smell disorder should also have a detector for natural gas or propane, lest a leak go undetected and result in an explosion.Perishable foods should be dated and kept refrigerated, and discarded when they expire. It may be wise for a person with normal olfactory function to check these foods before someone with an impaired sense of smell eats them.Make sure all cleaning and garden products are properly labeled and stored separately from foods.When cooking or baking, check periodically to make sure nothing is burning, and set a timer to ring when the food will be done.Since you can’t rely on a “sniff test,” be sure to bathe and launder clothes regularly. Use underarm deodorant, and go easy with cologne. Regularly check diapers for visual signs that a change is needed.For more information, consult the Web site of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smelltaste.'"
"'11-04-19,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan — Driven by soaring opium prices, farmers are expected to plant poppies at a sharply higher rate in parts of Afghanistan that were previously poppy free, the United Nations said Monday in its annual winter survey of poppy cultivation patterns in this country, the world’s leading opium purveyor.Poppy planting is expected to be down slightly over all because of modest decreases in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, the country’s most productive opium regions. The provinces continue to produce, but officials expected significant increases in the north and northeast provinces of Badakhshan, Baghlan and Faryab, as well as the southern and western provinces of Herat, Kapisa and Ghor.Baghlan, Faryab, Kapisa and Ghor were all poppy free in 2010. Sixteen of the country’s 34 provinces are expected to remain poppy free, a decrease from 20 last year. The drop represents what United Nations officials called a disturbing reversal in efforts to reduce opium production, a major revenue source for the Taliban insurgency.Prices for dry opium jumped 306 percent this year, to $281 a kilogram from $69 last year. It was the second consecutive year of sharp increases, which the report attributed to a blight that destroyed nearly half of last year’s crop.“Today we have prices never seen before since 2004,” said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, representative in Afghanistan for the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. “This is not business as usual. There is no crop that can compete with those prices.”'"
"'11-04-19,'1','Wilfried Martens, a Belgian politician who is president of the largest grouping of European parties from the center-right, the European People’s Party, said it was “disheartening to see a populist party rise to third place in Finland.”In Berlin, officials played down fears that Finland would undermine efforts to help Portugal, also citing its traditionally pro-European stance.“Finland had always worked toward the success of Europe, regardless of what government was in power,” said Christoph Steegmans, the deputy government spokesman in Germany. “Any agreements were always kept, and we are betting that that way will continue.”The True Finns ran on a platform that was hostile to the recent financial bailouts of Ireland, Greece and the agreement reached this month to aid Portugal. Those bailouts were meant to put an end to a sovereign debt crisis that has threatened the future of the single currency zone and raised questions about whether the disparate economies in Europe could ever be successfully integrated.“Of course there will have to be changes,” the True Finns leader, Timo Soini, said Monday about the Portugal package, Reuters reported.The True Finns were also critical of immigration policy, and their election gains came in the wake of advances by populist parties on the right across the European Union, including in the Netherlands, France and Sweden.In Brussels, European Union officials on Monday rejected suggestions that their strategy for the euro zone was failing.The vote in Finland, protests against austerity across Europe and continued volatility in financial markets should not obscure how the union had taken “measures which will enable us to get the economy on a sustainable track,” Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said in Brussels.She also said the commission was “fully confident” that Finland would continue to honor its commitment to participate in contributing to the European Financial Stability Facility, set up last year to provide financial assistance to euro zone members in difficulty.The pro-Europe National Coalition in Finland, led by Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen, has strongly supported efforts to remedy problems in the euro zone. He still could lead a future government, while Mr. Soini of the True Finns could agree to a compromise on participating in bailouts in exchange for posts in the next government.If Finland were to balk at helping Portugal, that would force other countries to make up the balance of the loan guarantees, potentially raising hackles in Germany and other countries, where the cost of the bailouts has also become a source of political tension.'"
"'11-04-19,'1','The article did not directly quote the general as saying anything overtly insubordinate.Its author, Michael Hastings, and his editors have repeatedly defended the article’s accuracy. Eric Bates, the executive editor of Rolling Stone, said on Monday that the article was “accurate in every detail.”The Pentagon report disputed key incidents or comments as reported in the article.“Not all of the events at issue occurred as reported in the article,” it stated. “In some instances, we found no witness who acknowledged making or hearing the comments as reported. In other instances, we confirmed that the general substance of an incident at issue occurred, but not in the exact context described in the article.”In a statement later Monday on its Web site, Rolling Stone questioned the methods of the Pentagon inspectors, who interviewed 15 people but not General McChrystal or Mr. Hastings.“The report by the Pentagon’s inspector general offers no credible source — or indeed, any named source — contradicting the facts as reported in our story, ‘The Runaway General,’ ” the Rolling Stone statement said. “Much of the report, in fact, confirms our reporting, noting only that the Pentagon was unable to find witnesses ‘who acknowledged making or hearing the comments as reported.’ This is not surprising, given that the civilian and military advisers questioned by the Pentagon knew that their careers were on the line if they admitted to making such comments.”The inspectors did suggest that some version of a Biden slur may have occurred, although they said they were unable to establish the exact words and the speaker. “We consider credible a witness’ recollection that General McChrystal said, ‘Are you asking about Vice President Biden? Who’s that?’ and that a follow-on comment or rejoinder of some sort referring to Vice President Biden was made,” the report said. “Witness testimony led us to conclude that someone in the room made a rejoinder about Vice President Biden to General McChrystal’s comment, and that the rejoinder may have included the words ‘bite me.’ ”The White House and General McChrystal have taken steps recently to make amends.While the Defense Department inspector general’s report was only made public Monday, it was completed April 8. Four days later, the White House announced that General McChrystal had been invited back to public service to help oversee a high-profile administration initiative in support of military families.An administration spokesman said Monday that the invitation to help guide the new program was extended before the White House knew the results of the Pentagon investigation.'"
"'11-04-19,'1','“If the U.S. gets downgraded, the cost of issuing new debt will definitely increase,” said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Scott. “It is a question of how much.”Mr. LaBas’s firm estimated in a study this year that there could be a 6 to 6.5 percent decline in American over three months as a result of any downgrade. Russell T. Price, a senior economist with , said that any downgrade could also hurt perceptions of the dollar and perhaps trade.“Even a small increase in the interest rate being charged on that debt could add significantly to the U.S. deficit problem,” he said.On Monday, the markets turned sharply lower in reaction to the news. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 140.24 points, or 1.14 percent lower, at 12,201.59. It was the Dow’s biggest decline since March 16.The broader S.& P. 500-stock index declined 14.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,305.14. The technology-heavy Nasdaq lost 29.27 points, or 1.06 percent, at 2,735.38.Stocks also fell across the -Pacific region early Tuesday, with the Nikkei 225 index in down 1.5 percent by midmorning. ’s main index fell 0.6 percent and in , the S.& P./ASX 200 index fell 1.3 percent.In its decision, the Standard & Poor’s ratings unit issued a strong warning to government leaders to agree on how to address the medium- and long-term budget challenges by 2013.“More than two years after the beginning of the recent crisis, U.S. policy makers have still not agreed on how to reverse recent fiscal deterioration or address longer-term fiscal pressures,” said Nikola G. Swann, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s. The firm said that there was a one in three chance that it could lower its long-term rating on the United States in two years.The statement initially made investors in nervous, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond as high as 3.45 percent. By the end of the day, the yield fell to 3.37 percent, down from 3.41 percent on Friday. The price of the 10-year bond rose 9/32, to 102 2/32.Previously, on Jan. 14, the S.& P. and another major credit ratings agency, , warned that the United States might tarnish its triple-A credit rating if its national debt kept growing. At that time, the Obama administration was warning that the government could reach its legal borrowing limit within a few months and urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a default.Administration officials played down the S.& P.’s assessment on Monday while reiterating Washington’s determination to reach a compromise on the deficit.Treasury officials “believe S.& P.’s negative outlook underestimates the ability of America’s leaders to come together to address the difficult fiscal challenges facing the nation,” an assistant secretary for financial markets, Mary J. Miller, said in a statement., chairman of ’s , said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that President Obama in a recent speech had said that there would be actions taken to promote fiscal responsibility.He said that S.& P.’s “political judgment” should not be given “too much weight.”Both President Obama and Republican lawmakers have suggested plans to cut the federal deficit by at least $4 trillion over the next 10 to 12 years, but by different methods. And Mr. Obama plans to take his message on the road this week, traveling to the West Coast to promote his proposal, which combines spending cuts and revenue increases.The Republican blueprint championed by Representative , Republican of and chairman of the House Budget Committee, includes cutting nonmilitary spending, and a politically charged proposal to fundamentally reconfigure .“We face the most predictable economic crisis in our history — a crisis driven by the explosive growth of government spending and debt,” said Mr. Ryan in a statement.Congressional Republicans quickly seized on the Standard & Poor’s analysis as an argument for advancing the newly adopted House budget that would cut an estimated $5.8 trillion over a decade. They sought to increase the pressure on Democrats against increasing the federal debt limit without some significant new limits on federal spending.“Serious reforms are needed to ensure America’s fiscal health, and today S.& P. sent a wake-up call to those in Washington asking Congress to blindly increase the debt limit,” said Representative , Republican of and House majority leader.As Republicans claimed the report bolstered their case against increasing the debt limit without new spending limits, Representative of , leader of the Democrats, said she read the findings as an indication that the two parties must move carefully and cooperatively to show a united front in trying to tackle the nation’s fiscal woes.“Both Democrats and Republicans must participate in the process initiated by President Obama last week to demonstrate our commitment to reducing our deficit through shared responsibility,” she said.With many lawmakers back home beginning a two-week recess, the S.& P. warning could weigh on some voters as Republicans try to sell their new plan.Standard & Poor’s did not take sides on any of the political proposals, saying that they were a good starting point. But it cautioned that “we see the path to agreement as challenging because the gap between the parties remains wide.”Analysts said that there were not many immediate implications to the S.& P.’s action. But over time, other ratings agencies could reconsider their recommendations on the United States’ sovereign debt.The S.& P. statement could spur the administration and lawmakers to find a way to reduce the nearly $1.5 trillion budget deficit and give the fiscal austerity debate a greater sense of urgency, said Capital Economics economists in a research note.'"

"'11-04-20,'1','CAIRO -- A Tunisian court on Tuesday dismissed the case against a policewoman accused of slapping the Tunisian street vendor whose subsequent self-immolation set off a wave of revolts across Tunisia and the Arab world, Tunisia’s official news agency, TAP, reported.The street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, 26, set himself on fire after a confrontation with the police officer, Fedia Hamdi, who had confiscated his fruit and slapped him in the face, according to other vendors who witnessed the incident in December. Mr. Bouazizi’s act of desperation fueled public outrage and led to a month-long uprising that finally toppled the authoritarian president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, and forced him to flee the country on Jan. 14. It also turned Mr. Bouazizi into a symbol of defiance against state oppression and systematic police violations, which inspired similar acts of self-immolation in Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania.According to the Tunisian news agency, Mr. Bouazizi’s mother “withdrew her complaint, ” and Ms. Hamdi denied the charges. The court’s ruling comes at a time of uncertainty for Tunisia as the new government investigates accusations of corruption and the excessive use of force against protesters.'"
"'11-04-20,'1','Two of Bernard L. Madoff’s investors on Tuesday lost their bid to bring a $2.5 million suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission, blaming the agency for failing to detect and end the Ponzi scheme.United States District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in New York threw out the 2009 lawsuit by the investors, Phyllis Molchatsky and Steven Schneider.“The plaintiffs fail to identify any specific mandatory duty that the S.E.C. violated in its numerous instances of sloppy, uninformed, irresponsible behavior,” the judge wrote in a 28-page ruling. “There is no reason to believe that information concerning any such duties would not be publicly available.”Judge Swain has 27 similar cases, according to the court docket. Judge Swain issued a separate order addressing plaintiffs and their lawyers in the 27 similar suits, directing them to file with the court by May 31 a statement outlining their positions “as to what further proceedings are appropriate,” in light of her ruling on Tuesday.Mr. Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence for running the fraud through Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Investors lost about $17 billion of principal in the Ponzi scheme, according to the latest calculations of the trustee liquidating the Madoff firm, who reported the number in a court filing on Monday.“We are disappointed with the judge’s opinion and continue to believe that the court is well-suited to oversee the S.E.C.’s actions and inactions, which were inarguably negligent,” the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Howard R. Elisofon of Herrick, Feinstein, said in an e-mailed statement.'"
"'11-04-20,'1','The New York solicitor general, Barbara D. Underwood, acknowledged that “this is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to arrive in this court.” But she said the Supreme Court should not block the suit until promised regulations from the federal agency are actually in place.“A lot can happen to delay or derail the fulfillment of a promise,” Ms. Underwood said, perhaps referring to the political controversy surrounding such regulations.When the lawsuit was filed in 2004, the E.P.A. under the Bush administration took the view that the Clean Air Act did not permit it to issue regulations addressing climate change and that it would be unwise to do so in any event.The suit said the courts should step in to protect the states from a “public nuisance” created by the defendants, five power companies collectively responsible for a quarter of carbon-dioxide emissions by utilities in the nation. Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit, saying the “balancing of economic, environmental, foreign policy and national security interests involved” was a task “consigned to the political branches, not the judiciary.”In 2009, more than three years after an appeal from Judge Preska’s decision was argued, a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, reversed her decision and allowed the case to proceed.The panel originally included Judge Sonia Sotomayor, but the decision was not issued until after her elevation to the Supreme Court. Justice Sotomayor has recused herself from the case at the Supreme Court.Since the suit was filed, the legal and political landscapes have changed. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate some emissions and was required to do so unless it had a scientific basis for its refusal. In the wake of that decision and after a change in administrations, the agency has issued regulations concerning emissions from cars and is at work on others.Neal K. Katyal, the acting United States solicitor general, argued in support of the defendants.“In the 222 years that this court has been sitting, it has never heard a case with so many potential perpetrators and so many potential victims,” he said.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. later asked Ms. Underwood for a counterexample, but she could not supply one.Justice Elena Kagan questioned the plaintiff’s “public nuisance” theory, one sometimes used to stop, say, utilities from dumping pollution into rivers.“One factory emitting discharge into one stream,” Justice Kagan said of such suits. “They don’t involve these kinds of national, international policy issues of the kind that this case does. I mean, there’s a huge gap, a chasm between the precedents you have and this case, isn’t there?”Ms. Underwood resisted, but not very much. “I don’t know if I would call it a chasm,” she said, “but there’s a large distance between them.”Peter D. Keisler, representing the defendants, said the theory behind the lawsuit was flawed.“To classify climate change as a tort,” Mr. Keisler said, “would trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away from the politically accountable branches and to the courts, which we think would be inconsistent with separation of powers.”Ms. Underwood countered that at least one branch of the government had to be ready to act.“We urge this court,” she said, “to keep the federal courts open to states exercising their historic power to protect their land and their citizens from air pollution emitted in other states.”But Chief Justice Roberts seemed to capture his colleagues’ mood in sketching out his own hesitation about the suit.“The whole problem of dealing with global warming is that there are costs and benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how much you want to readjust the world economy,” he said. “That’s a pretty big burden to impose on a district court judge.”'"

"'11-04-20,'1','“Early demand has been outstanding,” said Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in a conference call with analysts.Quarterly profit rose 29 percent to $3.16 billion, or 56 cents a share, up from a profit of $2.44 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter was $12.8 billion, up 25 percent from $10.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in Intel’s data center group grew 32 percent.The report beat Wall Street’s forecasts handily. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $11.6 billion and earnings of 46 cents a share for the quarter. Intel’s profit margin was 61 percent for the quarter, in line with expectations.The company announced the results after the close of the markets on Tuesday. Shares of Intel rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading, after closing up 24 cents at $19.86.With the PC industry facing mounting pressure from low-price tablet computers and smartphones, Intel executives said that the company planned to pursue both those areas. “We remain committed to success in the smartphone market,” Mr. Otellini said.Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said the strong results showed that smaller devices had not hurt PC demand as much as some might have thought. “It shows there’s still a need for PCs in the world,” he said.During the quarter, Intel closed on the acquisitions of Infineon Wireless Solutions and McAfee. The combination of both acquisitions contributed revenue of $496 million. Mr. Otellini told analysts that the earthquake and tsunami in Japan had closed its offices in the area but that Intel’s supply chain was not seriously affected.Intel’s results come amid concerns about the overall health of the PC market. Just last week, the research company IDC released a report saying that the global PC market declined 3.2 percent during the first quarter, the first major contraction since the economic recession began. The company originally predicted quarterly growth of 1.5 percent over last year.In explaining its gloomier view, the report pointed to rising fuel and commodity prices, combined with supply constraints caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.The Intel executives assured analysts that the company was not experiencing such a contraction, but rather the opposite, particularly in emerging markets. However, demand in the United States market remained soft, the executives said.In the fourth quarter, Mr. Otellini said that he expected Intel’s revenue to grow about 10 percent for the full year. But in January, company executives said growth would probably be in the mid- to high teens. On Tuesday, Mr. Otellini adjusted that forecast yet again, projecting revenue growth of more than 20 percent.“All of our product segments are growing,” Mr. Otellini said. “Over all, we are beginning 2011 with great momentum.”'"
"'11-04-20,'1','DETROIT — Toyota Motor said on Tuesday that it would cut production at its North American plants by 75 percent in the next six weeks to conserve its limited supply of parts made in Japan.The plants involved build about 70 percent of the vehicles Toyota sells in North America. As a result, significantly fewer cars — including the Camry and Corolla sedans and the RAV4 crossover — will be available this spring, a prime selling season for the industry.Toyota said the plants would be closed on Mondays and Fridays through June 3 and would run at half of their normal capacity on Tuesday through Thursday. In addition, the plants will be closed for a week in May, in conjunction with Memorial Day in the United States and Victoria Day in Canada.“We are trying to continue production as much as possible and keep our work force intact in order to facilitate a smooth transition back to full production when all parts are available,” Steve St. Angelo, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, said in a statement.None of the 25,000 workers affected will be laid off, Toyota said. The downtime will be used for training and plant improvements.The cuts affect five assembly plants and eight other locations that build engines or other parts, as well as a line at Subaru’s plant in Indiana that builds Camry sedans.

"'11-04-21,'1','For the German and British governments, there now appears to be a basic calculation: better to have a predictable stream of tax revenue — exactly how much remains unclear — than a string of slow-moving lawsuits.Estimates in Switzerland suggest Berlin might reap about 50 billion euros, or $71.4 billion, in the first year. For London, the figure would be lower, but nonetheless welcome for a government wrestling with a budget deficit.The Swiss are seeking to avoid repetitions of the legal action that led to UBS, the country’s largest bank, paying a $780 million fine in 2009 for helping Americans evade taxes. Swiss officials also say they hope to end the practice, more common in recent years, of Swiss bank employees’ selling stolen client lists to foreign governments, as well as the threat of more Swiss bank employees being arrested while abroad.Mario Tuor, a Swiss government spokesman for international financial affairs, said the issue of undeclared money should be settled by June and that the Swiss expected to win improved market access in Germany and Britain for their companies.Much is at stake for the Swiss economy. According to the Swiss Bankers Association, the financial sector generates about 11 percent of gross domestic output and provides about 200,000 jobs.The British treasury declined to comment, except to say that the talks were “ongoing and are positive.” A spokesman for the German finance ministry said that Berlin hoped to reach an agreement by the summer.Under the proposal, nonresident Germans and Britons with Swiss bank accounts would pay a flat, one-time tax, expected to be around 20 percent, on retained income, including dividend and coupon payments, interest rate income and capital gains from assets held in Switzerland. Details like how retroactive a charge would be and how assets will be valued remain to be seen.Subsequently, a flat-rate withholding tax, also based on capital gains and income, would be levied each year. It would be deducted by the bank, transferred to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, and once a year passed to the tax authorities of the clients’ home countries.Once it has been paid, the individual’s tax obligation toward the home country would have been fulfilled and client anonymity preserved.In 2009, the Swiss brokerage firm Helvea gave an estimate of 725.8 billion Swiss francs, or about $808.5 billion today, in undeclared European Union assets, about 84 percent of all European assets held in the country. Germany had the most, followed by Italy, France and Britain.The shift will bring further change to the smaller private banks that have traditionally served as niche fund managers to global elites, who often want to keep their financial affairs secret. As the size of the undeclared funds that they manage ebbs, these banks will have to fight in the increasingly tough wealth management market on the basis of fiscally transparent services.Among the smaller, private banks are Lombard Odier, Pictet & Cie, Bank Sarasin, EFG International, Julius Bär and Vontobel, as well as lenders owned by local governments including Zürcher Kantonalbank and St. Galler Kantonalbank.Some are likely to merge, some may be bought by larger groups and others will have to reduce their services, according to Martin Naville, chief executive of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce in Zurich.Most realize that they can no longer base their models on receiving undeclared funds, and that has drawn some criticism in the Swiss news media. “Everybody’s pointing fingers at the other guys,” Mr. Naville said. “But it’s all rumors, no one really knows who holds what.”There might even be a rare window for acquisitions by foreign banks.One private bank, Bank Sarasin, has already tried to adjust to the new landscape. It will no longer handle undeclared funds by 2012 and has been expanding in emerging markets like Qatar, India, Singapore and Poland. It no longer accepts American clients because of the additional regulatory burden resulting from new American legislation.Joachim H. Strähle, Sarasin’s chief executive, said banking secrecy still had a place, arguing that the trend of Western governments’ mining personal data as a security tool had scared away many wealthy clients regardless of their tax status. “A lot of people just don’t like their government having all this data,” he said.Other Swiss bankers contend that client confidentiality can offer legitimate means of sheltering money from despotic regimes or keeping their finances private for personal reasons, like hiding unusual pastimes, or keeping money away from ex-spouses.In any case, Swiss banks say they have more to sell than secrecy, citing political and economic stability, strong currency and professionalism.'"

"'11-04-21,'1','That spike in customer spending “looked fantastic,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris Brendler. “That was much better than expected.”The company set aside $97 million to cover lending written off as uncollectible. That was down 90 percent from $943 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting improvement in customer payment habits. Mr. Henry said write-offs in the first quarter were $541 million, down about $500 million from the first quarter of 2010.Mr. Henry attributed part of the improvement to the nature of the customers American Express is taking on in the current climate. The company is not offering low temporary rates for balance transfers, which reduces the potential for attracting risky customers. New customers tend to be people who use their cards frequently but pay their balances off each month, rather than carrying a month-to-month balance. And overall, customers remain more likely to reduce debt.“How customer behavior will change over the next 24 months, we’ll have to wait and see,” he said.American Express runs its own network to process transactions in addition to issuing cards, unlike most competitors, which do one or the other. That allows the company to earn money both by charging fees to merchants for handling purchases and by charging interest and fees to consumers.The company, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, also has the lowest default and late payment rates in the card industry. That gives it the ability to reinvest in its business, Mr. Brendler said.Expenses rose 19 percent to $5.2 billion from $4.37 billion last year.The chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement that Amex’s stepped-up spending helped the company take advantage of opportunities in the early stages of the economic recovery. Among the moves the company made during the quarter was the introduction of a digital payments platform called Serve that is aimed at attracting customers beyond the affluent base that uses American Express cards.Chenault said the company plans to slow the growth of operating expenses toward the end of this year and into next.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','THE wave of uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa is of historic significance equal to that of the revolutions of 1848 and 1989 in Europe. The peoples of the region, without exception, revolted not only in the name of universal values but also to regain their long-suppressed national pride and dignity. But whether these uprisings lead to democracy and peace or to tyranny and conflict will depend on forging a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and a broader Israeli-Arab peace.The plight of the Palestinians has been a root cause of unrest and conflict in the region and is being used as a pretext for extremism in other corners of the world. Israel, more than any other country, will need to adapt to the new political climate in the region. But it need not fear; the emergence of a democratic neighborhood around Israel is the ultimate assurance of the country’s security.In these times of turmoil, two forces will shape the future: the people’s yearning for democracy and the region’s changing demographics. Sooner or later, the Middle East will become democratic, and by definition a democratic government should reflect the true wishes of its people. Such a government cannot afford to pursue foreign policies that are perceived as unjust, undignified and humiliating by the public. For years, most governments in the region did not consider the wishes of their people when conducting foreign policy. History has repeatedly shown that a true, fair and lasting peace can only be made between peoples, not ruling elites.I call upon the leaders of Israel to approach the peace process with a strategic mindset, rather than resorting to short-sighted tactical maneuvers. This will require seriously considering the Arab League’s 2002 peace initiative, which proposed a return to Israel’s pre-1967 borders and fully normalized diplomatic relations with Arab states.Sticking to the unsustainable status quo will only place Israel in greater danger. History has taught us that demographics is the most decisive factor in determining the fate of nations. In the coming 50 years, Arabs will constitute the overwhelming majority of people between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea. The new generation of Arabs is much more conscious of democracy, freedom and national dignity.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','The Fish and Wildlife Service declined to make officials available for comment. But Gary Frazer, the agency’s assistant director for endangered species, discussed the mass of filings in an interview last year.“These megapetitions are putting us in a difficult spot, and they’re basically going to shut down our ability to list any candidates for the foreseeable future,” Mr. Frazer said. “If all our resources are used responding to petitions, we don’t have resources to put species on the endangered species list. It’s not a happy situation.”Two environmental groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, have filed 90 percent of the listings petitions since 2007 and maintain that a bioblitz, as it is often called, is the best strategy for forcing the service to be more assertive in its wildlife protection mission.“We want to compel the Fish and Wildlife Service to look at the full extent of the extinction crisis in the United States,” said Nicole Rosmarino, wildlife program director for WildEarth Guardians, which is based in Santa Fe, N.M. “We would like a system where the service is actively looking for species that merit protection rather than the current system where groups like ours have to drive this process.”The wider environmental community appears divided on the mass-listing strategy.“It is undoubtedly the case that the resources and the staffing for the Fish and Wildlife Service are inadequate,” said Bob Irvin, senior vice president for conservation programs at Defenders of Wildlife in Washington. “The question is, is tying the service in knots the best way to save the web of life?”In its 2012 budget request, the service estimated that in 2011 it will be able to make final listing decisions on only 4 percent of warranted petitions within one year as required by law, down from 12 percent in 2010.Since Congress passed the Endangered Species Act 37 years ago, some 1,370 species have been listed, the last being the southern rockhopper penguin. Last month, the agency asked Congress to impose a cap on the amount of money the agency can spend on processing listing petitions, both to control its workload and as a defense against lawsuits. “We would essentially use that as our defense for not doing more,” Mr. Frazer, the agency’s assistant director for endangered species, testified, “so that we can balance among the various duties that we have.”This month, Congress intervened with the list for the first time, removing protections for wolves in Montana and Idaho, but it is unclear whether it will act on the wildlife service’s current request.Patrick Parenteau, a professor and endangered species expert at Vermont Law School who was special counsel to the Fish and Wildlife Service in the 1990s, said he could empathize with both sides. “The agency does seem to be reaching a political tipping point,” he said. “They feel overwhelmed, they feel politically vulnerable, they can’t handle the job, and all these petitions makes it harder and harder.”“But from an endangered species conservation perspective, the environmentalists are doing exactly what the science demands,” he added. “If you want to save these species, you have to list them, designate their critical habitat and spend money.”WildEarth Guardians and the Center for Biological Diversity have filed more than 100 lawsuits against the Interior Department over listing delays involving some 1,100 species since 2007, according to government records. Under the act, the Interior Department must determine if a petition to list a species warrants further investigation within 90 days of its receipt. Officials acknowledge that the Fish and Wildlife Service invariably misses that deadline.If the agency issues a finding that a listing may be warranted, it has 12 months to conduct a scientific investigation and make a final determination. That deadline is often missed as well, leading to more litigation.The Center for Biological Diversity is a particularly formidable adversary. The nonprofit group, based in Tucson, has 20 lawyers on its staff in more than a dozen offices across the country. The center raised $7.5 million in 2009, according to its annual report, including $4.8 million from membership donations and $1.2 million in what it calls “legal returns” from cases.The Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2012 budget request includes $24.6 million for the endangered-species listing program, including paying a staff of 141. That is an 11 percent increase from the previous fiscal year and a 28 percent rise since 2009.Daniel J. Rohlf, an associate professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore., who specializes in endangered species law, said that was nowhere near sufficient.“In an age of accelerating threats to biodiversity, not just from habitat loss but from invasive species and climate change, the budgets for Fish and Wildlife Service have not even been close to keeping up with the demands on the agency,” Mr. Rohlf said.Noah Greenwald, the endangered species program director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the government needed to streamline the listing process. “It’s more efficient to list species in batches by habitat or geography,” he said. “The petitions are also designed in part to pressure them to take that approach more often.”According to a 2004 review conducted by the center, 42 species went extinct in the first 21 years of the Endangered Species Act’s existence while waiting to be listed. The study found that 24 species — including the four-angled pelea, a Hawaiian flowering plant, and the honeyeater, a bird native to Guam — became extinct while on the candidate list.Last year, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition to list 404 plants and animals, including the Alabama hickory nut and the frecklebelly madtom, citing an “extinction crisis” for species dependent on waterways in the Southeast.WildEarth Guardians began its barrage in 2007 in reaction to a sharp decline in listing decisions under the Bush administration. In that administration, only eight species were listed a year on average, compared with 58 per year in the Clinton administration, according to the center.In a little over two years, the Obama administration has listed 59 species, Mr. Rohlf said. Of those, 48 were species of Hawaiian birds and plants listed as a group, in the kind of broad approach to habitat advocated by the most active petitioners.“We’re pushing species to extinction every day, and it’s an overwhelming job, frankly, that the Fish and Wildlife Service has,” Mr. Parenteau said. “But is the answer to put your head in the sand and say, We’re not going to do it?”'"
"'11-04-21,'1','In the days after a bus traveling from a Connecticut casino crashed last month in the Bronx, the bodies of 14 victims were laid to rest. But the body of the 15th and final victim, Wang Jianhua, has lain in a funeral home in Chinatown while his widow, in China, has sought permission to come to the United States for his funeral.On Wednesday, the widow, Lin Yaofang, said American consular officials had granted her a visitor’s visa. “There are so many emotions; I can’t describe them,” said Ms. Lin, reached by telephone at her home in Gui’an, a rural village in Fujian Province. “I am so relieved. I get to see his face one last time.”Ms. Lin said she hoped to fly to New York next week. It would be her first trip out of China; the farthest she has ever traveled from home, she said, was to Guangzhou, in Guangdong Province, for the visa interview at the American Consulate.The hard life of Mr. Wang, 40, was described last month in an article in The New York Times. He and Ms. Lin grew up poor in Fujian Province, and they met and married about 10 years ago.They had two children, a boy and a girl, though Mr. Wang struggled to support his family working odd jobs and driving a taxi. In January 2008, he left China and, with the aid of smugglers, was brought to New York, where he found work as a restaurant deliveryman and lived in small, crowded apartments on the Lower East Side and in the Bowery.'"

"'11-04-21,'1','“People realize more and more that what’s good for me, including massage, is probably good for my animal,” said Jean-Pierre Hourdebaigt, an animal massage therapist and teacher in Wellington, Fla., whose book “Canine Massage: A Complete Reference Manual” is considered the standard text.“Today, you also have the baby boomers whose kids are gone,” Mr. Hourdebaigt said. They “have more time and money, and it’s easy for them to spend a couple hundred bucks on a massage seminar for their dog. The animal benefits, the benevolent action makes them feel good. Everybody’s happy.”By most estimates, only a few of the nation’s pet dogs and cats — which the American Pet Products Association estimates at 78.2 million and 86.4 million, respectively — are fortunate enough to receive massages. But the numbers may be growing. The International Association of Animal Massage and Bodywork, a professional group in Toledo, Ohio, now has more than 500 members, up from just 200 in 2007. And a survey of more than 1,200 pet owners across the United States and Canada by the American Animal Hospital Association in Lakewood, Colo., found that the number who were pursuing alternative therapies for their animals — including acupuncture, massage, chiropractic and herbal medicine — rose to 21 percent from 6 percent between 1996 and 2003. (It may still be rising; the survey was discontinued after 2004.)Many pet owners interested in massage hire professionals to perform the treatment. But the D.I.Y. approach — in which pet owners like Ms. Lane learn the techniques themselves — also seems to be gaining in popularity, as Mr. Hourdebaigt maintains. At the Northwest School of Animal Massage in Fall City, Wash., 170 people took the basic amateur workshop last year; eight years ago, only 24 people enrolled. At the Boulder College of Massage Therapy in Colorado, enrollment in a similar class has jumped 30 percent in the last two years.Becky Brandenburg, an animal-massage practitioner and teacher in Martins Ferry, Ohio, said she started offering occasional workshops for pet owners last year, but now plans to offer them monthly. “Every time I announce a class, it’s filled within a day or two,” Ms. Brandenburg said. “It’s really taken off.”THE origins of pet massage can be traced to equine massage, a treatment popularized in the 1970s and ’80s by Jack Meagher, a massage therapist who worked with the United States equestrian team. By the early 1990s, a handful of people experienced in human or equine massage, or both, had begun adapting Mr. Meagher’s technique for use on dogs and cats.Sometimes, it is veterinarians who suggest the practice to pet owners. Nanci Sloan Cummings, a mortgage loan officer in Lake Oswego, Ore., said she was urged by her veterinarian to try massage for her 12-year-old arthritic collie, Baxter. Although in his sprightlier days the dog could trek several miles, by last year he was able to walk only a couple of blocks. To see if she could help him become more limber, Ms. Cummings took a three-hour massage workshop at a dog day-care center in January.Nearly every evening since then, she has put down a cushioned mat near the ficus tree and potted fern in the living room of her three-bedroom house, and performed the routine she learned: kneading, squeezing, stroking and tapping Baxter.“At night, when I watch ‘American Idol,’ I’ll sit on the floor and massage him to the music,” Ms. Cummings said. “It’s very distressing to see your aging animal suffer, and very rewarding to think that maybe you can help him feel better. I think just the attention and affection, if nothing else, is helpful.”But there are plenty of veterinarians who believe that massage offers little beyond the attention and affection. They note that few clinical studies of pet massage have been conducted, and that claims of its benefits are usually extrapolated from research on humans. At best, they say, pet massage fortifies the bond between human and animal in the same way that a good belly scratch does, and at worst, it may aggravate a serious medical condition or prevent owners from seeking veterinary help.“I have two dogs, and I pet them all the time,” said David W. Ramey, a veterinarian in the Chatsworth area of Los Angeles, and a co-author of “Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine Considered,” a book that looks at the science behind various alternative therapies for pets. “I think everybody should pet their dogs. But I don’t refer to that as ‘massage,’ and I certainly wouldn’t send anyone to a glorified school of dog petting.”Narda Robinson, a veterinarian at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, has a more benign view. Dr. Robinson, who established a canine medical massage course at the university in 2008, believes that massage, properly administered, can help dogs recover from illness, injuries and stress. And while massage classes for dog owners are largely unregulated and of varying quality, she said, they can be helpful as long as they are “based on actual science, rather than lost in mysterious energies.”FOR many pet owners, though, the goal is not therapeutic — it’s just to make their dogs feel good.One recent Sunday afternoon, several people showed up for an advanced canine massage class at My Dog’s Place, a training school in Mystic, Conn., along with their charges: a miniature dachshund, a Rhodesian Ridgeback, a cocker spaniel and a few others. The dogs sniffed their hellos, then settled on blankets on the floor, and Suzin Webb, who teaches about 15 such courses a year, began her instruction.For two hours, the students worked the muscles along their dogs’ spines, stretched their limbs, rolled the dogs’ skin between their fingers and gently tugged their tails. By the end of the class, none of the dogs seemed particularly eager to move.The miniature dachshund, 13-year-old Wylie Angelo, lay on his back, tongue out, limbs splayed. His owner, Cricket Murphy, a 67-year-old aesthetician, had taken Ms. Webb’s beginners’ class three years earlier to help Wylie Angelo heal from disk surgery. Since then, she has been massaging him every morning.Their ritual takes place in the bedroom of her house overlooking Long Island Sound in Niantic, Conn. Ms. Murphy fetches a dish of water and a homemade cranberry biscuit for the dog, and then the two sit on Ms. Murphy’s king-size bed, she with her back against the headboard and Wylie Angelo in front of her on a down pillow. She begins the massage by rubbing his belly with rose ointment.Ms. Murphy said she believes that this daily routine has improved Wylie Angelo’s mobility and bolstered his circulation. But she is more certain about other benefits.“He goes straight to la-la land,” Ms. Murphy said. “It’s a very quieting time for us. We’re in bed together, he’s propped up on a pillow, and pretty soon, he’s just in the zone.”Jean-Pierre Hourdebaigt, a teacher and practitioner of canine massage, recommends that pet owners interested in learning the technique enroll in a class, study a textbook like his “Canine Massage: A Practical Guide” or watch one of the many instructional DVDs on the topic. He also offered a few pointers.• Start with light pressure. “Most people have so much power in their hands, they don’t realize that it can be too much for some animals,” Mr. Hourdebaigt said. Only if the dog seems comfortable should the pressure be increased.• Maintain an even speed. “If you’re erratic — starting fast, slowing down, getting fast again — the animal worries too much,” he said. “If you maintain one stroke per second, whether you’re doing gentle kneading or friction, the animal can relax in the flow of the rhythm.”• Place the pet on a table to keep your own posture comfortable. “If you massage on the floor on your knees, you will get sore knees and a sore back, which makes you tense up and makes the whole experience more negative,” he said.• Avoid massaging the animal with other animals nearby. “If you have several dogs in your house, and take one particular dog aside and isolate him on the table while the others are having fun, he’ll feel like he’s missing out on something and won’t relax.”• Learn palpation, a technique of touching aimed at discovering abnormalities. “Any time you feel unusual heat, puffiness or swelling on the animal, back off,” Mr. Hourdebaigt said. And before doing any massage on the suspect spot, ask a veterinarian.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','Last week, a friend turned us on to a newish flower delivery service, H. Bloom. Open about a year, and serving Manhattan, Jersey City, Hoboken and parts of Brooklyn, for now, as well as Washington, H. Bloom follows the fruit-of-the-month-club model, delivering fresh flowers on a weekly, biweekly or monthly schedule for a range of fees, starting at about $30 for a bunch of loose blooms.In a place like Manhattan, where even the mingiest corner deli might offer tulips for, say, $6 a bunch, such a service does not feel like an intuitive market necessity, until you consider that those tulips have a shelf life of about 24 hours. H. Bloom’s value nugget is that it gets its flowers directly from growers, so they last longer.We sampled two assortments (and after five days both were still healthy): an “arrange your own,” for $31.57 with tax, and a “classic” arrangement, for $38.11. The former came wrapped in brown paper, stems clamped with tiny water-filled tubes, and its blooms — yellow hyacinths, orchids, solidago, aster and a huge aspidistra leaf — were nice enough. The “classic” however, was lovely: roses, white hyacinths, viburnum and heather.'"

"'11-04-21,'1','A declaration in the court filings by the orchestra’s chairman, Richard B. Worley, laid out its case for seeking protection from creditors. Mr. Worley said the orchestra’s annual payments to its home at the Kimmel Center, amount to $2.5 million — about $1.5 million more than the costs to play at its old home, the Academy of Music. The orchestra played its first concert in Verizon Hall in late 2001.Mr. Worley also blamed the “complex contractual structure” of the relationships between Kimmel, the orchestra and the Academy of Music (which the orchestra owns but that Kimmel now operates). As an example, he said, Kimmel handles customer service — critical to building ties with patrons — for the orchestra at Verizon Hall but “has no immediate stake” in the Philadelphia Orchestra’s success.Anne C. Ewers, Kimmel’s president and chief executive, gave a different set of numbers. She said the orchestra owed it $1.2 million for rent and labor, although Kimmel had “forborne” payments of $650,000 from this season, meaning it had put off any decision on whether or not to demand payment.“Already we have done a great deal,” Ms. Ewers said, emphasizing that Kimmel officials were willing to talk about doing more. She said the orchestra had not paid rent for April. “Once we miss the May payment, then it becomes a real detriment for the Kimmel Center,” she said.Ms. Ewers said she also wanted to make the point that the rent owed was a small amount, given the size of the deficit. She also took issue with the implication that the center ignored the orchestra’s interest at Verizon. “If ticket sales don’t go well with the orchestra, it’s an immediate hit to our bottom line,” she said. “Their health is very much our health.”The orchestra said half of its total annual costs “directly relate to musician expense.” It also faces at least $44.8 million in pension liabilities, it added, although the musicians say the number is much lower.Orchestra players and union officials have denounced the bankruptcy filing as unnecessary and a disaster for fund-raising and musician recruitment.Going to bankruptcy court was a “clumsy, flat-footed attempt by management to free itself” from its obligations to the musicians’ pension funds and to pry “unjustified contract concessions” from the players, according to a statement by Ray Hair, president of the American Federation of Musicians. The players and management are struggling to negotiate a new contract.Mr. Worley, in his declaration, said the purpose of the bankruptcy filing was “relief from pension obligations,” a new collective bargaining agreement, a renegotiated deal with the Kimmel Center and an end to its obligations to Mr. Nero and others. The orchestra, through its affiliate, Encore Series, presents Mr. Nero’s pops concerts, which it said would run an $800,000 deficit this season alone.The Philadelphia Orchestra board assigned the bankruptcy filing to the Philadelphia law firm of Dilworth Paxson, which has worked for the orchestra before. The firm’s chairman — Joseph H. Jacovini — is a member of the executive committee of the orchestra’s board.In a filing seeking approval to handle the case, a Dilworth lawyer, Lawrence G. McMichael, said Mr. Jacovini had no role in the preparation of the case, would not be privy to internal firm communications on the matter, and would receive no related fees. Mr. Jacovini also stayed aloof from the board’s decision to seek bankruptcy, Mr. McMichael said, and would continue to recuse himself from orchestra board discussions about the bankruptcy.The filing said the orchestra and its affiliates seeking bankruptcy protection had already paid the firm $319,306.63 for the bankruptcy work so far.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','But ever since a Democratic majority took control of the five-member board after Mr. Obama’s election, the board has signaled that it would seek to adopt a more liberal, pro-union tilt after years of pro-employer decisions under President Bush.Although the board has not yet issued many major decisions reversing Bush-era policies, it has proposed requiring private sector employers to post a notice about workers’ right to unionize, and Mr. Solomon has begun moving more aggressively to win reinstatement of union supporters fired illegally by management during unionization drives.In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Solomon said: “A worker’s right to strike is a fundamental right guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act. We also recognize the rights of employers to make business decisions based on their economic interests, but they must do so within the law.”South Carolina’s two senators, both Republicans, Lindsey Graham and Jim DeMint, denounced the board’s move. “This is nothing more than a political favor for the unions who are supporting President Obama’s re-election campaign,” Mr. DeMint said.The labor board said that in 2007, Boeing announced plans to create a second production line that would make three 787 Dreamliner planes a month in the Puget Sound area to address a growing backlog of orders. That was to be in addition to a line already making seven Dreamliners a month there. In October 2009, Boeing said it would locate its second line at a new, nonunion plant in South Carolina.The N.L.R.B. asserted that on numerous occasions Boeing officials had communicated an unlawful motive for transferring the production line, including an interview with The Seattle Times in which a Boeing executive said, “The overriding factor was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.”Mr. Solomon brought the complaint after a union representing many of Boeing’s Washington workers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, complained that Boeing had decided to move production to South Carolina largely in retaliation for a 58-day strike in 2008.“Boeing’s decision to build a 787 assembly line in South Carolina sent a message that Boeing workers would suffer financial harm for exercising their collective bargaining rights,” said the union’s vice president, Rich Michalski.Mr. Solomon said that if he failed to settle the dispute, an administrative judge would begin hearing the case on June 14 in Seattle. Mr. Solomon said he was not seeking to close the South Carolina factory or prohibit Boeing from assembling planes there.Boeing criticized the timing of the N.L.R.B.’s complaint, saying it came when construction of the factory in North Charleston, S.C., was nearly complete and after 1,000 employees had already been hired there.Boeing said on Wednesday that none of the production jobs in South Carolina had come at the expense of jobs in Washington. It noted that its unionized employment in the Puget Sound area had increased by 2,000 since it announced its decision to expand in South Carolina.The company also said it had decided to expand in South Carolina in part to protect business continuity and to reduce the damage to its finances and reputation from future work stoppages.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','The arrival of the iPad2, just before the quarter ended March 26, helped stoke tablet sales. Apple sold 4.69 million tablets in the quarter, including the iPad2 as well as the original version.Consumers bought so many, in fact, that Apple is having trouble keeping up with the demand, prompting analysts to ask when Apple could ramp up production, and by how much.Mr. Cook acknowledged the problem, calling it “the mother of all backlogs,” but he declined to be more specific about this quarter’s production. Apple’s Web site says there is a one- to two-week delay in shipping online orders.A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that while Apple’s overall results were extraordinary, the number of iPads sold was a disappointment. “Whether Apple somehow messed up or was unable to secure components is an open question,” he said, but added, “It does sound like production will increase dramatically in the current quarter.”To underscore his confidence, Mr. Cook reminded analysts that he approved Apple’s introduction of the iPad2 in 25 additional countries in late March and that the device will go on sale in 13 more countries next week.Even Apple’s MacBook laptop computers, an afterthought amid all the buzz around Apple’s phones and tablets, showed big gains after the introduction of updated versions during the quarter. Apple sold 2.75 million laptops, a 53 percent increase.Sales of Mac desktop computers, however, fell 12 percent, to one million.Apple’s computer sales defied an industrywide decline of 3.2 percent in computer shipments in the first quarter that was attributed to the disasters in Japan and a lack of better technology that would prompt consumers to upgrade, according to the research firm IDC.Apple said it did not expect any significant impact on its supplies from Japan, where it gets hundreds of components.The iPod, Apple’s music player, was among the few disappointments. Sales declined again, yet another indication of how smartphones, generally incorporating music players, are replacing single-function products. Sales of the iPod fell 17 percent, to 9.02 million.Apple reported that net income in the second quarter rose 95 percent, to $5.99 billion, or $6.40 a share, from $3.07 billion, or $3.33 a share, in the year-ago quarter.The results surpassed analysts’ expectations of $5.35 a share and revenue of $23.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Shares of Apple rose 3.1 percent, to $353.02 in after-hours trading after the announcement. In regular trading, shares had climbed 1.35 percent, to $342.41.Mr. Cook has been in charge of Apple’s day-to-day operations since early this year after Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive and co-founder, took a leave of absence. Mr. Jobs, who has battled pancreatic cancer, said he needed to deal with health issues.Asked about Mr. Jobs and his role at the company these days, Mr. Cook said: “He continues to be involved in major strategic decisions, and I know he wants to be back full time.”Apple said it expected third-quarter revenue of around $23 billion and $5.03 a share. That is below analysts’ forecasts of $23.82 billion in revenue and $5.25 a share in income.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','For the German and British governments, there now appears to be a basic calculation: better to have a predictable stream of tax revenue — exactly how much remains unclear — than a string of slow-moving lawsuits.Estimates in Switzerland suggest Berlin might reap about 50 billion euros, or $71.4 billion, in the first year. For London, the figure would be lower, but nonetheless welcome for a government wrestling with a budget deficit.The Swiss are seeking to avoid repetitions of the legal action that led to UBS, the country’s largest bank, paying a $780 million fine in 2009 for helping Americans evade taxes. Swiss officials also say they hope to end the practice, more common in recent years, of Swiss bank employees’ selling stolen client lists to foreign governments, as well as the threat of more Swiss bank employees being arrested while abroad.Mario Tuor, a Swiss government spokesman for international financial affairs, said the issue of undeclared money should be settled by June and that the Swiss expected to win improved market access in Germany and Britain for their companies.Much is at stake for the Swiss economy. According to the Swiss Bankers Association, the financial sector generates about 11 percent of gross domestic output and provides about 200,000 jobs.The British treasury declined to comment, except to say that the talks were “ongoing and are positive.” A spokesman for the German finance ministry said that Berlin hoped to reach an agreement by the summer.Under the proposal, nonresident Germans and Britons with Swiss bank accounts would pay a flat, one-time tax, expected to be around 20 percent, on retained income, including dividend and coupon payments, interest rate income and capital gains from assets held in Switzerland. Details like how retroactive a charge would be and how assets will be valued remain to be seen.Subsequently, a flat-rate withholding tax, also based on capital gains and income, would be levied each year. It would be deducted by the bank, transferred to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, and once a year passed to the tax authorities of the clients’ home countries.Once it has been paid, the individual’s tax obligation toward the home country would have been fulfilled and client anonymity preserved.In 2009, the Swiss brokerage firm Helvea gave an estimate of 725.8 billion Swiss francs, or about $808.5 billion today, in undeclared European Union assets, about 84 percent of all European assets held in the country. Germany had the most, followed by Italy, France and Britain.The shift will bring further change to the smaller private banks that have traditionally served as niche fund managers to global elites, who often want to keep their financial affairs secret. As the size of the undeclared funds that they manage ebbs, these banks will have to fight in the increasingly tough wealth management market on the basis of fiscally transparent services.Among the smaller, private banks are Lombard Odier, Pictet & Cie, Bank Sarasin, EFG International, Julius Bär and Vontobel, as well as lenders owned by local governments including Zürcher Kantonalbank and St. Galler Kantonalbank.Some are likely to merge, some may be bought by larger groups and others will have to reduce their services, according to Martin Naville, chief executive of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce in Zurich.Most realize that they can no longer base their models on receiving undeclared funds, and that has drawn some criticism in the Swiss news media. “Everybody’s pointing fingers at the other guys,” Mr. Naville said. “But it’s all rumors, no one really knows who holds what.”There might even be a rare window for acquisitions by foreign banks.One private bank, Bank Sarasin, has already tried to adjust to the new landscape. It will no longer handle undeclared funds by 2012 and has been expanding in emerging markets like Qatar, India, Singapore and Poland. It no longer accepts American clients because of the additional regulatory burden resulting from new American legislation.Joachim H. Strähle, Sarasin’s chief executive, said banking secrecy still had a place, arguing that the trend of Western governments’ mining personal data as a security tool had scared away many wealthy clients regardless of their tax status. “A lot of people just don’t like their government having all this data,” he said.Other Swiss bankers contend that client confidentiality can offer legitimate means of sheltering money from despotic regimes or keeping their finances private for personal reasons, like hiding unusual pastimes, or keeping money away from ex-spouses.In any case, Swiss banks say they have more to sell than secrecy, citing political and economic stability, strong currency and professionalism.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','“I think it’s best to avoid a race to the bottom,” he said. “It’s an easy race to win, but you won’t have a lot of profit to show for it.”This guide offers examples of small-business owners who decided to raise prices and the lessons they learned.DON’T ASSUME PRICE IS ALL About three years ago a computer error caused all of the prices on Headsets.com to be displayed at cost rather than retail. With the lower prices on display for a weekend, Mike Faith, the chief executive, expected sales to soar. Instead, the increase was marginal. “It was a big lesson for us,” Mr. Faith said.He realized that sales for his company, which is based in San Francisco, were far less dependent on price than on what he now says differentiates his business: customer service. “Every call we get is answered by a human being within four rings,” he said, “and our reps are well trained and know a lot about the headsets.”Since the incident, Mr. Faith has raised prices once, by 8 percent and without much fanfare, although regular customers were told in advance. The result? Revenue rose about 8 percent as well.“Over all, we didn’t notice any change in sales revenues, but all our sales were of the higher margin,” he said. “Did some customers not like the price? Yes, I’m sure. But that’s the case with any price you charge — there’s always somebody cheaper. The truth about pricing is it’s an art with a little bit of science, rather than a science with a little bit of art.”Melanie Downey, the owner of Wilava, which manufactures and sells natural skin care products, also assumed that her customers were motivated primarily by price. Over time, she realized she had set prices too low to sustain the business. Yet she hesitated to raise them because she wanted her products to be affordable for those who needed them, and many of her customers have cancer or severe skin problems, including children with eczema. Concerned about maintaining trust, she decided not to act until after the company’s spring busy season.The increase will range from 4 percent to 20 percent across Wilava’s line. Ms. Downey has been alerting customers in person and has gotten positive, even encouraging, feedback. In the next few weeks she will begin telling online customers. “I’m nervous about that,” she said, “since I won’t get immediate feedback.”Still, looking back at the last year, she said, “I wish I had done this months ago.”RIVALS’ PRICES MAY NOT MATTER A lot of small-business owners set prices just by looking at what their competitors charge. Naomi Poe, founder of Better Batter Gluten Free Flour near Altoona, Pa., learned that it is important to try to understand how your customers value your product.In the food industry, Ms. Poe said, customers generally look for the cheapest price, but because her flour and baking mixes contain no gluten, they cost more to manufacture. She initially tried to compete with products that contain gluten on price but lost money on every sale.To raise prices, she had to convince customers her products offered added value. “In blind taste tests on regular people — not just those who are gluten-free — we heard consistently that our cakes were superior,” she said. “We also offer an unconditional guarantee as well as education and counseling.”Her first year in business, 2008, she raised prices 20 percent, increasing her gross profit margin — the profit on each item she sells — about 11 percent and increasing sales revenue 25 percent, she said.“This helped us cover our expansion costs in 2008,” Ms. Poe said. After that, the business grew about 250 percent year to year.In January she raised prices an additional 10 percent, this time to cover broker and distributor fees as well as the rising cost of fuel and ingredients. Far from losing customers, she saw her revenue double and her gross margins leap to about 36 percent from 20 percent.Even so, because she was spending a lot on expansion and advertising, she was not making a profit.Ms. Poe recently raised prices again, this time 13 percent, to cover increases in merchant fees, to enable her company to offer volume discounts, and because she had underestimated how fast costs for fuel and ingredients would rise.Growth has slowed, but business is still up 159 percent from the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2011. Ms. Poe says she expects her company to be profitable by the end of the year.The owners of Footzyrolls, a Miami Beach company that sells flat shoes that roll up to fit in a handbag, learned a similar lesson when big retailers began selling knockoffs of their shoes. “We had to differentiate ourselves from the $10 version at Target, so we went to tiered pricing,” said Sarah Caplan, who founded the company with her sister.Last year, they changed their offerings, going to two tiers of products and pricing. The Everyday Collection sells for $20 a pair and a higher-end category, Lux, for $30 a pair. “We actually have had the most interest in our higher-priced shoes,” Ms. Caplan said.Because they brought one line down $5 and another up $5, the average price per unit remained about the same, but the impact was immediate. “We introduced the Lux line in summer 2010 and had a 100 percent increase in revenue,” she said. “We actually ran out of stock.”COVER YOUR COSTS Katie Danziger, founder of Nomie Baby in Manhattan, sells a removable, washable cover for infant and child car seats. When she set her prices, she considered only materials and manufacturing costs. It was Ms. Danziger’s first experience owning a business and she did not know better.“I didn’t have anyone I could ask, so I just looked at what I thought would be my biggest costs,” she said. It is a surprisingly common mistake. “I hadn’t taken into account the cost of shipping, storage, designing and printing marketing materials, packaging, liability insurance,” she said. “These wound up much more significant than I anticipated.”Her first year in business, Ms. Danziger raised the price of each cover to $36 from $34, a relatively small increase, but one that made her margins much less precarious. And the increase did not slow sales. They were up 150 percent in 2010 from 2009.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','Other factors that are helping precious metals include the buildup to the early autumn wedding season in India, during which families lavish gifts of gold on brides; the longstanding shortage of skilled labor and equipment at certain mines; and the increase in the number of mutual funds investing in gold.The recent popularity of gold-based exchange-traded funds has also propelled prices of the underlying metal by making it easier for more investors to trade in gold.Each share in a gold exchange-traded fund represents part of an ounce of bullion, but it comes without the inconvenience of holding the metal or the risk of buying futures and options. Before such funds became popular in the middle of the last decade, individuals who wanted to invest in gold had to buy gold jewelry, coins or bullion — and pay the high security and transaction costs. They could also invest in the shares of gold mining companies — more of an arm’s-length exercise — although the cost of investing in those companies has also risen recently.In addition to benefiting from increased demand for the underlying metal, gold and silver futures contracts are seen as attractive substitutes for paper investments, given that they can be redeemed for a physical commodity.“Gold is sometimes a currency, sometimes a commodity and sometimes a store of value,” analysts at Merrill Lynch wrote recently.Gold for June delivery rose as high as $1,506.50 a troy ounce during trading in New York on Wednesday before settling at $1,498.90, a gain of $3.80 on the day. It was the first time that gold had breached the $1,500 level.While that represented the highest level in nominal terms, the inflation-adjusted price was higher during the early 1980s, when it was well above $2,000 in current dollars.Silver prices also climbed on Wednesday. Silver for May delivery climbed 1.2 percent, to $44.46 a troy ounce in New York, after rising as high as $45.40, the highest price since 1980. A troy ounce is 31.1 grams, or 1.1 ounces.Although gold prices are likely to remain volatile and are vulnerable to retreat as investors take profits on their gains, few analysts are willing to bet on a sharp reversal in the near term. “As the purchasing power of workers in emerging markets increases, we see demand for gold as a commodity increasing over the next few years,” the Merrill Lynch report said.In a research note published Friday, Goldman Sachs forecast a gold futures price of $1,690 an ounce in 12 months’ time, driven primarily by the assumption that the Federal Reserve’s continued stimulus policy, known as quantitative easing, would keep interest rates low in the United States, bolstering demand for the metal as an investment.The market for silver, which Mr. Bhar of Crédit Agricole described as a “poor man’s gold,” is far more illiquid than gold. Mr. Bhar said several hedge funds appeared to have been “bullying” the price higher in recent sessions. Prices of palladium and platinum have also climbed.Less valuable base metals like copper, tin, aluminum and zinc, which are used in large quantities in construction and heavy industries, have also climbed since last year, after plummeting during the financial crisis.But among these commodities, there have been more divergences, according to Jim Lennon, head of commodity research in London for Macquarie Securities.Markets for commodities like coking coal, used to make steel, iron ore and copper have been tight, he said, driven by inventory accumulation from producers and concerns about output bottlenecks at mines in Africa, Australia, Brazil, Chile and China.For other base metals like aluminum, zinc and nickel, supply and demand appear better matched, he added.Overhanging many of these markets remained the question of China, and whether its roaring economy might soon cool down. Many metals’ traders and analysts have had to become China watchers, poring over the economic data issued by that country and studying accumulations of stocks in Chinese warehouses. During the first quarter, China’s economy expanded 9.7 percent from a year earlier.Investment and consumer spending in China have remained robust despite the government’s effort to temper growth through interest rate increases and curbs on bank lending.'"
"'11-04-21,'1','BEIJING — Two leading Chinese human rights lawyers have been released after disappearing during the country’s continuing crackdown on dissent.One of the lawyers, Jiang Tianyong, returned home on Tuesday after being detained two months ago, according to human rights groups in touch with his family.Mr. Jiang’s phones were either switched off or out of order, but China Aid, a Christian human rights group that has tracked the lawyer since his conversion to Christianity, said he was at home and in good spirits. His wife, Jin Bianling, told Reuters that he was in good health but that the couple could not speak to the media.Mr. Jiang was picked up twice in mid-February. After his first detention on Feb. 16, he said in an interview that he had been taken to a police station, where he was assaulted. Three days later, he was forced into an unmarked van and taken into custody again, his wife said. The couple’s home was searched, and his computer and briefcase were confiscated.Mr. Jiang’s case was raised by the State Department, which accused China of extralegal detentions.The second lawyer, Liu Xiaoyuan, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had been released Tuesday after having been held for five days. He said he had been bundled into a van on April 14 and did not know where he had been taken.'"

"'11-04-22,'0','WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled Thursday that a Congressional committee did not have to turn over documents to Roger Clemens for use in his perjury trial, but he delayed a decision on a related issue, about whether George J. Mitchell’s former law firm should be immune from producing records.Judge Reggie Walton of the United States District Court instead ordered lawyers for DLA Piper, the firm that assisted Mitchell in his 2007 report on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball, to allow him to view documents that the firm claims are protected work product. Walton will then decide at trial whether the documents should be given to Clemens’s lawyers.The day offered a preview of a major theme likely to arise at trial — the credibility of Brian McNamee, Clemens’s former trainer, who is expected to be a central witness in the government’s argument that Clemens lied to Congress.Lawyers for Clemens said they planned to argue at trial that McNamee’s word cannot be trusted because he told different versions of his story to federal officials, Mitchell’s investigators and Congress.“If Mr. McNamee’s mouth is moving, he’s making an inconsistent statement,” Rusty Hardin, Clemens’s lawyer, said.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','“People are so freaked out by what is happening in the world,” she said, before loading her groceries into a . Of green products, she said, “That’s something you buy and think about when things are going swimmingly.”Sales in most consumer-products categories dropped off during the recession. But according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, certain green products have fared worse.“You see disproportionately negative impact from products like Green Works, out of the big blue-chip companies that have tried to layer a green offering on top of their conventional offering, and a relatively better performance from the niche players who remain independent,” said Stephen Powers, an analyst at Bernstein. Using data from the Nielsen company, Bernstein looked at sales for nearly 4,300 items in 22 categories, like cleaning spray, liquid soap, bathroom cleaners and detergents. It studied monthly sales from March 2006 to March 2011, the most recent data available. (Nielsen’s data includes mass market, grocery stores and drugstores but excludes Wal-Mart.)Bernstein found that the market shares of green products generally were down from their peak — especially those offered by the big consumer-products companies. But the market share of the independent brands, like Method and Seventh Generation, is starting to increase relative to the shares of traditional brands’ green products in categories where they compete.“In terms of the big players like Clorox, there’s no doubt that they’ve de-emphasized the brands relative to their early aspirations, and that’s reflective of what they are seeing from the consumer,” Mr. Powers said.Green products are more expensive because the ingredients tend to cost more than their more conventional counterparts, and transportation costs are higher too because they are sold in smaller volumes than the big brands.Green household products took off in the 1980s, with brands like Seventh Generation and Simple Green, which have gained a loyal following. As retailers like Whole Foods expanded in the 1990s, interest in the environment increased and competitors joined the fray.Predicting that the market would continue to increase, mainstream manufacturers like S.C. Johnson, Clorox and Church & Dwight introduced eco-friendly versions of their products around 2008.But after an initial lift, sales largely dropped off, and the introduction of products slowed during the recession.The number of household cleaners with green claims introduced in 2008 was 144, up from 29 in 2007. By 2009 that had dropped to 105, according to Mintel, a research firm. Green dishwashing liquid followed a similar pattern, with 14 introductions in 2007, 85 in 2008, then 58 in 2009.Some of the manufacturers pulled back on advertising, too.Clorox spent more than $25 million advertising Green Works in both 2008 and 2009, but just $1.4 million in 2010, according to Kantar Media, which tracks advertising spending.Similarly, S.C. Johnson introduced Nature’s Source in 2009. That year, it spent $15.4 million advertising the products, more eco-friendly versions of its brands like Windex and Scrubbing Bubbles.In 2010, spending to advertise the line fell to zero, according to Kantar.Sales have gone south, too. In the 12 months through March, sales of Nature’s Source Scrubbing Bubbles all-purpose cleaner have dropped 71 percent, to $589,614, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, which tracks sales at mass-market stores, excluding Wal-Mart. Nature’s Source Windex dropped 35 percent, to $1.8 million. Nature’s Source Scrubbing Bubbles tub and tile cleaner dropped 61 percent, and Nature’s Source toilet bowl cleaner dropped 78 percent.And that was as prices on all of those items were reduced.Officials at S.C. Johnson did not return calls seeking comment. At Church & Dwight, its Arm & Hammer Essentials multisurface cleaner, glass cleaner and laundry detergent are no longer being produced for the United States market, less than three years after they were introduced.“Arm & Hammer Essentials cleaners may have been ahead of their time,” said the chief marketing officer, Bruce Fleming, in an e-mail. Its concentrated cleaners, for instance, were sold with an empty spray bottle, and consumers had to add their own water to make the cleaning sprays.“We haven’t given up on launching innovative, earth-friendly products, we’ve just taken a step back to think about how and when consumers will be ready,” he said.Heidi Dorosin, vice president for marketing for the cleaning division of Clorox, said Green Works’ sales had been battered by the recession and inconsistent pricing. The company has lowered its prices and made them more consistent, she said.Sales held up at smaller, and more expensive, brands like Method and Seventh Generation, Mr. Powers suggested, because those customers tended to be more affluent and more wedded to environmental causes. Both companies say they had double-digit growth in 2010 after a flat year in 2009.Back in Evanston, shoppers reflected the changing dynamics of the green marketplace. A handful said they continued to buy green products religiously while many others said the cost was prohibitive. Sarah Pooler, 55, said she did not normally buy green products but would pick them up if they were on sale.“Bottom line, if it’s green and it’s a good deal, I’ll buy it,” said Ms. Pooler, outside a Jewel-Osco store.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','Aside from the city’s efforts to curb smoking, Mr. Bloomberg said the heating oil regulations were “the single biggest step that we’ve taken to save lives.”Under the new rule, by 2015, existing boilers must switch from No. 6 oil to a low-sulfur version of the No. 4 heating oil or to an equivalent cleaner fuel. Any newly installed boiler would have to burn an even less polluting grade — low-sulfur No. 2 oil — or natural gas or an equivalent low-emission fuel, which would in effect eventually phase out No. 4 oil.Boilers not replaced by 2030 would need to be modified to meet the new regulations.Building owners said the biggest challenge in making the conversion was cost, particularly for smaller buildings in these tough economic times.In a statement, the Real Estate Board of New York said it would work with the Bloomberg administration “to identify and implement ways to achieve those goals in an expeditious and sensible manner.”The organization has previously noted that compliance costs will be borne by tenants in the form of higher rents or maintenance charges.It will cost about $10,000 or less to convert boilers to use No. 4 oil — and much more to switch to No. 2 oil or natural gas. City officials said buildings that demonstrated a severe financial hardship could seek an extended schedule for complying.More than 200 public schools are among the buildings that must make the switch.The phase-out, when fully in effect, will reduce the amount of fine particles emitted by heating buildings by at least 63 percent and lower the overall concentration of fine particles in the city’s air from all sources by 5 percent.“The health benefits will be dramatic,” said Andy Darrell, the New York regional director for the Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group that will work with the city to educate building owners about the conversions.In an address on the eve of Earth Day, Mr. Bloomberg presented the first update to PlaNYC, which calls for such revisions every four years.Speaking at Harlem Stage, a performing arts site inside Harlem’s Gatehouse, to an audience of city officials, environmental groups and others who helped update the plan, the mayor also announced the start of a new nonprofit corporation, the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation, that will use $37 million in federal money to make loans to building owners for energy-efficiency upgrades.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','SHANGHAI (AP) — The police on Thursday clamped down on a demonstration by hundreds of truck drivers upset over rising fees and fuel prices in Shanghai, China’s busiest port city, in the latest display of public resentment over surging inflation.The police acted after the drivers blocked a dock in the Pudong district of eastern Shanghai on Wednesday, according to an employee of a logistics company.Drivers gathered about 40 trucks on Thursday at a cargo-handling center in the Baoshan district on the city’s northeastern outskirts, but there was no repeat of the violence that broke out on Wednesday, when a trucking company owner said that eight or nine truckers were arrested when they tried to overturn a traffic patrol car.China’s leaders have been trying to defuse mounting public frustration over inflation, which reached 5.4 percent in March, a 32-month high, driven substantially by a nearly 12 percent increase in food costs.They have said that restraining inflation is their priority this year. Cities have raised minimum wages by 10 percent to 20 percent, but that has failed to keep pace with rising living costs in many areas.'"

"'11-04-22,'0','As the religiously conservative government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan prepares for nationwide elections in June, this newly assertive drive led by the B.D.P. is seen as a democratic litmus test for Mr. Erdogan.Arguably Turkey’s most powerful and regionally influential leader since Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the republic, Mr. Erdogan, who has transformed Turkey into an economic dynamo, has drawn increasing criticism at home and abroad for a recent crackdown on journalists, writers and other critics.Those concerns were amplified this week when Turkey’s electoral body disqualified 12 parliamentary candidates, seven of whom were from the B.D.P., from running in the June elections. The decision set off violent protests not just in traditional Kurdish hotbeds like this city, Van and Hakkari but in Istanbul as well. B.D.P. leaders threatened to boycott the elections. On Thursday,  the electoral body revised its decision, saying that eight of the barred candidates were now eligible, following appeals by the candidates. But it was unclear whether that would mollify Kurdish anger.All of which represents an awkward challenge for Mr. Erdogan — who had urged Egypt’s former leader, Hosni Mubarak, to listen to his own people during the Egyptian uprising — and to Turkey’s broader reputation as the region’s most advanced democracy.For a political party that has been closed down six times, the four demands that underpin the B.D.P.’s protest movement ask much of a state that has always been extremely sensitive to any perceived threat to its unity.The demands call for the right for Kurds to be educated in their own language and the freedom to use it in the political arena; the immediate cessation of military operations against Kurds by the Turkish Army; the release of all political prisoners, including Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurds’ illegal military wing, the P.K.K.; and the removal of the controversial 10 percent electoral threshold that bars any party that cannot attract that share of the national vote from gaining seats in Parliament.In its blend of the reasonable, like language and representation rights, and the more far-fetched, like the release of Mr. Ocalan, the Kurdish demands exemplify the tensions within the movement between those who want change through the ballot box and those who prefer to secure it by more violent means.Perhaps no one embodies this push and pull more so than Abdullah Demirbas, the Kurdish mayor of one of Diyarbakir’s larger municipalities. Jailed in 2009 for having used Kurdish in an official capacity as mayor, he was released last year and was recently re-elected.Over lunch at a local restaurant, where he was frequently interrupted by his constituents giving their best wishes, Mr. Demirbas recounted the story of his 18-year-old son who abandoned high school two years ago to join the P.K.K. and its armed struggle.“When I got my jail sentence he told me: ‘That is what you get for being a democrat — now it is time to fight,’ ” Mr. Demirbas said. Attempts to dissuade his son were unsuccessful, and Mr. Demirbas has not had any communication with him since then. In fact, he cannot be sure if he is alive.“As a father I was upset, but my son was fighting for freedom,” he said. “It’s the state I blame, not him. It is so important to solve these problems in a democratic way, but how do we do this if they put us in jail?”When Mr. Demirbas speaks of Mr. Ocalan, he uses the Turkish honorific “sayin,” loosely translated as esteemed, and he refers to him as “the representative for three million Kurds in Turkey.” Because Mr. Ocalan led a military uprising that resulted in the loss of more than 36,000 lives and is seen by most Turks as an unreconstructed terrorist, statements like Mr. Demirbas’s anger many and feed a suspicion that the party is a front for the P.K.K.“We have given them schools, TV channels and still they want more,” said Remzi Akin, the owner of a leather shop and a part-time taxi driver in Istanbul. “You extend your hand and then they take your whole body.”Mr. Akin, a supporter of Mr. Erdogan, fumes with anger that Mr. Ocalan has not yet been hanged.But his view, while perhaps on the extreme side, is one that the government, which has gone further than any other in ceding ground to the Kurds, is sensitive to because it can ill afford to alienate the large number of Turks who see any concession to the P.K.K. as traitorous.Still, the shift in attitude toward the Kurds under Mr. Erdogan has been significant. His government has removed the emergency law that covered the southeast in 2002, and it has established a Kurdish-language channel. This month, Turkey’s finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, who is Kurdish, delivered portions of a public speech in Kurd-dominated northern Iraq in Kurdish.For Kadri Yildirim, who operates a Kurdish-language institute at a state-run university in Mardin, a mountaintop town that overlooks northern Syria, those and other changes are, he said, “beyond my wildest dreams.”Opened a year ago, the four-year postgraduate program trains teachers in the Kurdish language and culture and is to be followed by a similar course for undergraduates — a baby step, but one that Mr. Yildirim said he saw as positive nonetheless.But as tensions increase before the elections, these small measures of progress have been overcome by the push for faster, bolder changes.“Why shouldn’t I be able to listen to my Friday sermon in Kurdish?” asked Resat Dalgic, a 56-year-old shoeshine man, as he prepared to attend the mass prayer protest. “It’s a basic right, is it not?”'"
"'11-04-22,'0','On Thursday, the former presidential candidate who is the protest leader, Kizza Besigye, was bundled into a police van and taken to court within minutes of stepping onto a Kampala street. But unlike his previous arrests during the protest movement, Mr. Besigye was not granted bail on Thursday, and was later whisked away to a prison far outside of the city.Norbert Mao, another jailed former presidential candidate who is leading protests, was transferred to the same prison outside of Kampala, indicating a growing sensitivity on the part of the government to the politicians’ provocations and influence.Until Thursday, the protesters in Kampala seemed only as bold as the senior politicians often at the front of the march. But with the leaders jailed, the demonstrations on Thursday grew on their own and evolved into a violent parade of protesters, some holding up banners attacking government corruption, and many with rocks.“The situation is pushing us,” said Jamo Luyombya, 24, a day laborer. “They are controlling us with the power of the gun, but not with their power of love.”In Kampala, heavily armed soldiers and police officers fought running street battles with stone-wielding protesters through a popular market as thousands stood on rooftops and balconies to watch.In the town of Masaka, far from journalists covering the protests in Kampala, a 2-year-old was killed after being shot in the chest and head when the police opened fire with live ammunition near a crowd of unarmed protesters, according to Ugandan news reports.Many more were reported wounded in Masaka, and two police officers were hospitalized after being severely beaten by protesters there, the police said. A news report said that the two officers had died on the way to the hospital.“The Ugandan government must immediately end the excessive use of force against protesters,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Thursday. “The police have a duty to protect themselves and uphold the law, but it is completely unacceptable to fire live ammunition at peaceful protesters.”The events could prove pivotal for a movement that so far has failed to gain the same momentum and social cohesion as protests over similar concerns in northern Africa.“The rioting shows that people need change of government,” said Annek Cabine, a bystander at the market where the protest came through. “Otherwise, this problem could become like Libya.”But many still see the protest movement as contrived, propped up by politicians bitter over brutal electoral losses. Others wonder whether it has a chance of displacing Mr. Museveni, who has been in power for a quarter-century.“The key to regime change is of course the army,” said Dr. Elliot Green, a Uganda specialist at the London School of Economics, who said that Mr. Museveni had “done well” in keeping the army “in his pocket.”But Dr. Green said Africa had a long history of urban food riots that brought down governments.“Obviously the current situation in Burkina Faso should also worry Museveni, where a riot by soldiers was sparked by a food riot,” said Dr. Green. “Museveni has a lot to be worried about.”'"
"'11-04-22,'0','SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal jury on Thursday rejected Mattel’s claims that it owns the copyright to the blockbuster billion-dollar Bratz dolls and instead awarded an upstart rival, MGA Entertainment, more than $88 million in damages for misappropriation of trade secrets.The jury, which deliberated for nearly two weeks after a three-month trial, also found that Mattel had acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating MGA’s trade secrets. MGA lawyers said that raised the possibility the judge could increase the damages by up to three times the jury’s award.The verdict will allow MGA to regain control of its flagship fashion doll, which was introduced in 2001, and to once again try to compete with Mattel’s Barbie doll.“If Mattel had won this lawsuit, MGA would have been wiped out, and that’s what Mattel wanted to do,” MGA’s lawyer, Jennifer L. Keller, said.Mattel’s chief executive, Robert A. Eckert, who was present for the verdict, said in a statement that the company was disappointed.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','While privacy advocates and many iPhone users were alarmed by the revelations, Mr. Levinson and other security experts said they suspected that Apple had been using the data to be able to pinpoint a phone’s location more quickly, saving bandwidth and battery life, when their owners used location-based services like maps and navigation.Still, the controversy has been magnified by Apple’s silence. For the second day, the company did not respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment.But in a letter sent by Apple in July to two congressmen — Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas — the company appeared to confirm that it has been storing and collecting location information for some time.In the letter, Apple said it collects the location data anonymously and only when consumers agree to use its location-based services like maps, or any apps that ask a user’s location, and for its advertising system, iAds. The company said that it has been offering location-based services since 2008, but that only in 2010, when it released iOS 3.2, did it begin relying on its own databases for those services. Explaining its need to collect data from its customers’ phones, Apple wrote, “These databases must be updated continuously.”Security experts say companies like Apple and Google collect the location of Wi-Fi networks and cell towers to pinpoint the location of phones without using GPS technology. Some suggested Apple was doing so through the users of its iPhones.Mark Seiden, an information security consultant in Silicon Valley, said that Apple’s letter to the congressmen suggests that it uses the location data from the previously hidden file “so a phone knows where it is quickly.” Mr. Seiden said that Apple did not appear to be using the data to track people, but that the company should probably be more diligent about deleting dated location information. “I don’t know why they would want to keep old data on the device,” he said.Mr. Markey on Thursday sent a follow-up letter to Apple asking it to explain why it was storing the information in the user’s device, and raising concern that its actions could violate the Communications Act.“Apple needs to safeguard the personal location information of its users to ensure that an iPhone doesn’t become an iTrack,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. On Wednesday, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, also sent a letter asking Apple for an explanation.The controversy erupted on Wednesday, when two computer programmers issued a report at a conference in San Francisco describing the files with the hidden data. The programmers also released a program that allowed users to see their stored location data on a map.Some privacy experts were particularly concerned that the files were not encrypted, and that they were backed up on users’ computers.The concerns quickly spread to Europe, where privacy laws are typically stricter than in the United States.The Bavarian Agency for the Supervision of Data Protection, in Germany, said it would examine whether — and if so, why — the iPhone and iPad were storing such user data. Thomas Kranig, the director of the agency, said his office had asked Apple whether geographic information was being stored and for what purpose.“If it’s true that this information is being collected, and it is being done without the approval and knowledge of the users, then it is definitely a violation of German privacy law,” Mr. Kranig said.The Italian Data Protection Authority also opened an investigation into Apple’s data collection, expanding one it had begun on how mobile applications process personal data, Reuters reported.France may follow suit. Yann Padova, the secretary general of CNIL, the French data protection authority, said the agency was trying to verify the report by the American programmers.The French agency plans to send Apple France a letter asking for an explanation next week, Mr. Padova said. A major concern will be whether the information remained on the device or whether it was transferred by Apple to one of its commercial partners.“In the first case, it is a matter of simply not obtaining the consent of  the consumer for the data to be collected,” Mr. Padova said. “In the second case, if the information is marketed without the knowledge of the consumer, it is much more serious.”'"

In one especially ridiculous scene in “Animals Distract Me,” Ms. Rossellini and André Leon Talley, the fashion editor, begin talking gibberish to illustrate how Sweety perceives their conversation.Two series of very short films that Ms. Rossellini made for the Sundance Channel, “Green Porno” and “Seduce Me,” about the sex lives of spiders, dolphins and assorted other creatures, border on the bizarre. They are droll and informational at the same time and, like some vignettes in “Animals Distract Me,” feature Ms. Rossellini in an array of outlandish costumes. For instance, the whale suit she dons to show the male half of that species in midreproduction leaves nothing to the imagination in terms of the animal’s appendages. Ms. Rossellini may have a highbrow pedigree — her father was the director Roberto Rossellini, her mother Ingrid Bergman — but she has a wicked, winking sense of humor.“She always has a point of view about the world that is a little off center,” said Laura Michalchyshyn, president of Planet Green, part of Discovery’s group of channels.In the new film “she’s making a big statement about how humans and our interactions influence the world, but she doesn’t do it with straight finger-pointing, she does it with humor,” added Ms. Michalchyshyn, who first worked with Ms Rossellini when she was an executive at the Sundance Channel. “She doesn’t take herself so seriously that she can’t talk dog-talk with André Leon Talley or can’t dress up as a cabbage.”She is serious, though, about the work she does for the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind in Smithtown, N.Y., on Long Island. Bau — the name is from the Italian equivalent of the sound of a dog’s bark, as in bow-wow — is the eighth dog she has trained. She also sometimes acts as a midwife to pregnant dogs being used by the foundation; she takes them into her home in the Long Island town of Bellport and oversees the birth and the first five weeks of the puppies’ lives.“Mostly they are Labs or golden retrievers,” Ms. Rossellini said, though efforts are being made to turn poodles into guide dogs because some people who are allergic to other breeds aren’t allergic to them. Another trend comes from war: “Now they’re breeding very big dogs that act like walking sticks” for veterans with head injuries that leave them with impaired balance, she said.On the stroll through Midtown, at 40th and Eighth, Bau was a bit distracted by a food cart. Crosswalks were still a problem. And so were obstacles like trash cans and lampposts.“The dog is always calculating so he doesn’t walk you into a pole,” Ms. Rossellini said, referring to fully trained dogs, not to Bau. She then demonstrated his need for work in this area by letting him walk near a lamppost. Sure enough, Bau — the dog is always on the human’s left side, by the way — didn’t have the calculation thing down yet; he left himself enough room to get past the pole, but Ms. Rossellini, had she been blind, would have clanged right into it.An amble down a sidewalk, though, is only the simplest thing a guide dog is asked to do; any old mutt can probably manage that. But it takes a dog with a certain kind of personality, Ms. Rossellini said, to make the command decisions that are sometimes needed.“The dog has to be obedient, but it has to be willing to overrule,” Ms. Rossellini said.

"'11-04-22,'0','Some employees will be able to move into other jobs with Nokia, Mr. Elop said, and Nokia may have openings as a result of its partnership with Microsoft. Because of those opportunities, Nokia said it could guarantee employment to its existing employees through this year.Nokia also confirmed that it had signed its agreement with Microsoft to obtain the Windows operating system for Nokia’s smartphones. The two companies announced the partnership on Feb. 11. Since then, Nokia’s stock price has fallen by about a third.The cost-cutting initiative came as Nokia lost its lead in cellphone revenue to Apple, the research firm Strategy Analytics said on Thursday, according to Reuters.Nokia’s phone revenue fell to $9.4 billion in the last quarter, while Apple’s revenue from the iPhone increased to $11.9 billion, the research firm said.“With strong volumes and high wholesale prices, the PC vendor has successfully captured revenue leadership of the total handset market in less than four years,” Alex Spektor, an analyst, said.Nokia also reported Thursday that its profit fell slightly, to 344 million euros ($497 million) in the first quarter from 349 million euros ($504 million) in the period a year earlier.Sales rose 9.2 percent, to 10.4 billion euros ($15.0 billion), in large part because of gains in Latin America and China, where Nokia’s sales rose 29 percent and 30 percent respectively. Sales in North America fell 36 percent, and sales in Europe fell 5 percent.Nokia said its sales of smartphones rose 13 percent in the quarter, to 24.2 million units from 21.5 million. The market grew 74 percent over all during the same time, Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with the International Data Corporation in London, said.On top of that, the average selling price fell 6 percent in the same period, to 147 euros from 155 euros a year earlier, Nokia said.The company said it had sold 108.5 million cellphones of all types during the quarter, 1 percent more than a year ago. Yet its global share of the cellphone market fell to 32 percent from 34 percent a year ago, according to I.D.C.Mikko Ervasti, an analyst at Evli Bank, a private bank in Helsinki, said the cuts in operating expenses were needed to bring Nokia in line with its cellphone peers, like Apple, which on average spend only half or even less on research and development than Nokia does.Mr. Ervasti said the cost-cutting could translate into 6,000 fewer jobs in its cellphone research and development work force, or roughly 38 percent of Nokia’s total staff for mobile phones. Those employees are now working in Finland, China, India, Germany, England, Denmark and San Diego.“These cuts were needed and are in line with what the market was expecting,” Mr. Ervasti said. “This is a direct consequence of the Microsoft agreement, and Nokia’s own need to trim expenses.”'"

"'11-04-22,'0','“G.E. health care, transportation and aviation delivered strong results,” Mr. Immelt said. “Strategic investments in high-growth segments have strengthened the company’s energy portfolio and position that business to return to growth in the second half of this year.”Over all, revenue rose 6 percent, to $38.45 billion in the first quarter, exceeding analysts forecasts of $34.64 billion. Revenue in the same quarter a year ago was $36.2 billion.The results and outlook reflected the company’s efforts to diversify and make acquisitions, while trying to build its businesses in crucial sectors like energy. On Thursday, the company described itself as “cautiously optimistic” about the gas turbine business, with strong orders from the Middle East and plans to help Japan meet its energy demands after its nuclear plant was damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.“Our teams are working diligently to support our customers in Japan,” Mr. Immelt said in a conference call.Early this month G.E. announced plans to build the nation’s largest photovoltaic panel factory, with the goal of becoming a major player in the market.G.E. also completed the sale of 51 percent of NBC Universal to the Comcast cable network in the quarter, which resulted in an after-tax gain of 4 cents a share. In the deal, Comcast paid General Electric nearly $6.2 billion in cash and contributed its pay television channels like E Entertainment Television and the Golf Channel, worth $7.25 billion, to NBC Universal.General Electric said when announcing its last results in January that it had a backlog of orders that positioned it for growth in 2011, with the transportation, health care and finance units expected to lead in earnings. On Thursday, Mr. Immelt said the backlog, a gauge of future results, was $177 billion.Richard Tortoriello, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said the orders numbers suggested growth in the global economy, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, China and India.“G.E. is a bellwether in the sense that they are one of the largest industrial companies out there, but they have a larger proportion of what you might call long cycle business than others,” Mr. Tortoriello said.“We are not taking off like a rocket ship,” he said, “especially with regard to the U.S. and Europe, but the growth is there.”The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny, to 15 cents, beginning in the third quarter, the report said. It increased its dividend twice in 2010. In July, the dividend was raised to 12 cents a share from 10 cents, and in December it was increased further, to 14 cents. The company paid 31 cents a share until February 2009, when, for the first time since the Great Depression, the board cut the dividend to conserve cash.Timothy A. Hoyle, a vice president at Haverford Investments, said the potential for a dividend increase was apparent in 2010 as the company’s capital unit returned to normal and as it finished a deal involving the sale of NBC Universal. “We saw plenty of excess capital generation,” Mr. Hoyle said. “That is happening.”But he also noted that G.E. had said it had a decline to 14.3 percent in industrial operating margins because of weakness in the energy sector, partly as a result of lower wind turbine pricing.The company’s shares fell 45 cents, or 2.21 percent, to close at $19.95 on Thursday.While G.E. is a household name as a manufacturer of common household products like lights bulbs and electric fans, it also has a diverse portfolio of finance and business units.Its lending division, GE Capital, the nation’s largest nonbank financial institution, has provided more than half of G.E.’s profit in some recent years. But the unit was struggling amid the fallout from the collapse of the real estate market, and Mr. Immelt has tried to refocus G.E. more toward the industrial sector.The company said GE Capital reported net income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up from $583 million in the period a year ago.“With losses having peaked, we are originating new business at attractive margins and our funding costs continue to be favorable,” Mr. Immelt said of GE Capital.'"

Mitchell’s former law firm should be immune from producing records.Judge Reggie Walton of the United States District Court instead ordered lawyers for DLA Piper, the firm that assisted Mitchell in his 2007 report on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball, to allow him to view documents that the firm claims are protected work product. Walton will then decide at trial whether the documents should be given to Clemens’s lawyers.The day offered a preview of a major theme likely to arise at trial — the credibility of Brian McNamee, Clemens’s former trainer, who is expected to be a central witness in the government’s argument that Clemens lied to Congress.Lawyers for Clemens said they planned to argue at trial that McNamee’s word cannot be trusted because he told different versions of his story to federal officials, Mitchell’s investigators and Congress.“If Mr. McNamee’s mouth is moving, he’s making an inconsistent statement,” Rusty Hardin, Clemens’s lawyer, said.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','While privacy advocates and many iPhone users were alarmed by the revelations, Mr. Levinson and other security experts said they suspected that Apple had been using the data to be able to pinpoint a phone’s location more quickly, saving bandwidth and battery life, when their owners used location-based services like maps and navigation.Still, the controversy has been magnified by Apple’s silence. For the second day, the company did not respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment.But in a letter sent by Apple in July to two congressmen — Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas — the company appeared to confirm that it has been storing and collecting location information for some time.In the letter, Apple said it collects the location data anonymously and only when consumers agree to use its location-based services like maps, or any apps that ask a user’s location, and for its advertising system, iAds. The company said that it has been offering location-based services since 2008, but that only in 2010, when it released iOS 3.2, did it begin relying on its own databases for those services. Explaining its need to collect data from its customers’ phones, Apple wrote, “These databases must be updated continuously.”Security experts say companies like Apple and Google collect the location of Wi-Fi networks and cell towers to pinpoint the location of phones without using GPS technology. Some suggested Apple was doing so through the users of its iPhones.Mark Seiden, an information security consultant in Silicon Valley, said that Apple’s letter to the congressmen suggests that it uses the location data from the previously hidden file “so a phone knows where it is quickly.” Mr. Seiden said that Apple did not appear to be using the data to track people, but that the company should probably be more diligent about deleting dated location information. “I don’t know why they would want to keep old data on the device,” he said.Mr. Markey on Thursday sent a follow-up letter to Apple asking it to explain why it was storing the information in the user’s device, and raising concern that its actions could violate the Communications Act.“Apple needs to safeguard the personal location information of its users to ensure that an iPhone doesn’t become an iTrack,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. On Wednesday, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, also sent a letter asking Apple for an explanation.The controversy erupted on Wednesday, when two computer programmers issued a report at a conference in San Francisco describing the files with the hidden data. The programmers also released a program that allowed users to see their stored location data on a map.Some privacy experts were particularly concerned that the files were not encrypted, and that they were backed up on users’ computers.The concerns quickly spread to Europe, where privacy laws are typically stricter than in the United States.The Bavarian Agency for the Supervision of Data Protection, in Germany, said it would examine whether — and if so, why — the iPhone and iPad were storing such user data. Thomas Kranig, the director of the agency, said his office had asked Apple whether geographic information was being stored and for what purpose.“If it’s true that this information is being collected, and it is being done without the approval and knowledge of the users, then it is definitely a violation of German privacy law,” Mr. Kranig said.The Italian Data Protection Authority also opened an investigation into Apple’s data collection, expanding one it had begun on how mobile applications process personal data, Reuters reported.France may follow suit. Yann Padova, the secretary general of CNIL, the French data protection authority, said the agency was trying to verify the report by the American programmers.The French agency plans to send Apple France a letter asking for an explanation next week, Mr. Padova said. A major concern will be whether the information remained on the device or whether it was transferred by Apple to one of its commercial partners.“In the first case, it is a matter of simply not obtaining the consent of  the consumer for the data to be collected,” Mr. Padova said. “In the second case, if the information is marketed without the knowledge of the consumer, it is much more serious.”'"

"'11-04-22,'0','As the religiously conservative government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan prepares for nationwide elections in June, this newly assertive drive led by the B.D.P. is seen as a democratic litmus test for Mr. Erdogan.Arguably Turkey’s most powerful and regionally influential leader since Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the republic, Mr. Erdogan, who has transformed Turkey into an economic dynamo, has drawn increasing criticism at home and abroad for a recent crackdown on journalists, writers and other critics.Those concerns were amplified this week when Turkey’s electoral body disqualified 12 parliamentary candidates, seven of whom were from the B.D.P., from running in the June elections. The decision set off violent protests not just in traditional Kurdish hotbeds like this city, Van and Hakkari but in Istanbul as well. B.D.P. leaders threatened to boycott the elections. On Thursday,  the electoral body revised its decision, saying that eight of the barred candidates were now eligible, following appeals by the candidates. But it was unclear whether that would mollify Kurdish anger.All of which represents an awkward challenge for Mr. Erdogan — who had urged Egypt’s former leader, Hosni Mubarak, to listen to his own people during the Egyptian uprising — and to Turkey’s broader reputation as the region’s most advanced democracy.For a political party that has been closed down six times, the four demands that underpin the B.D.P.’s protest movement ask much of a state that has always been extremely sensitive to any perceived threat to its unity.The demands call for the right for Kurds to be educated in their own language and the freedom to use it in the political arena; the immediate cessation of military operations against Kurds by the Turkish Army; the release of all political prisoners, including Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurds’ illegal military wing, the P.K.K.; and the removal of the controversial 10 percent electoral threshold that bars any party that cannot attract that share of the national vote from gaining seats in Parliament.In its blend of the reasonable, like language and representation rights, and the more far-fetched, like the release of Mr. Ocalan, the Kurdish demands exemplify the tensions within the movement between those who want change through the ballot box and those who prefer to secure it by more violent means.Perhaps no one embodies this push and pull more so than Abdullah Demirbas, the Kurdish mayor of one of Diyarbakir’s larger municipalities. Jailed in 2009 for having used Kurdish in an official capacity as mayor, he was released last year and was recently re-elected.Over lunch at a local restaurant, where he was frequently interrupted by his constituents giving their best wishes, Mr. Demirbas recounted the story of his 18-year-old son who abandoned high school two years ago to join the P.K.K. and its armed struggle.“When I got my jail sentence he told me: ‘That is what you get for being a democrat — now it is time to fight,’ ” Mr. Demirbas said. Attempts to dissuade his son were unsuccessful, and Mr. Demirbas has not had any communication with him since then. In fact, he cannot be sure if he is alive.“As a father I was upset, but my son was fighting for freedom,” he said. “It’s the state I blame, not him. It is so important to solve these problems in a democratic way, but how do we do this if they put us in jail?”When Mr. Demirbas speaks of Mr. Ocalan, he uses the Turkish honorific “sayin,” loosely translated as esteemed, and he refers to him as “the representative for three million Kurds in Turkey.” Because Mr. Ocalan led a military uprising that resulted in the loss of more than 36,000 lives and is seen by most Turks as an unreconstructed terrorist, statements like Mr. Demirbas’s anger many and feed a suspicion that the party is a front for the P.K.K.“We have given them schools, TV channels and still they want more,” said Remzi Akin, the owner of a leather shop and a part-time taxi driver in Istanbul. “You extend your hand and then they take your whole body.”Mr. Akin, a supporter of Mr. Erdogan, fumes with anger that Mr. Ocalan has not yet been hanged.But his view, while perhaps on the extreme side, is one that the government, which has gone further than any other in ceding ground to the Kurds, is sensitive to because it can ill afford to alienate the large number of Turks who see any concession to the P.K.K. as traitorous.Still, the shift in attitude toward the Kurds under Mr. Erdogan has been significant. His government has removed the emergency law that covered the southeast in 2002, and it has established a Kurdish-language channel. This month, Turkey’s finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, who is Kurdish, delivered portions of a public speech in Kurd-dominated northern Iraq in Kurdish.For Kadri Yildirim, who operates a Kurdish-language institute at a state-run university in Mardin, a mountaintop town that overlooks northern Syria, those and other changes are, he said, “beyond my wildest dreams.”Opened a year ago, the four-year postgraduate program trains teachers in the Kurdish language and culture and is to be followed by a similar course for undergraduates — a baby step, but one that Mr. Yildirim said he saw as positive nonetheless.But as tensions increase before the elections, these small measures of progress have been overcome by the push for faster, bolder changes.“Why shouldn’t I be able to listen to my Friday sermon in Kurdish?” asked Resat Dalgic, a 56-year-old shoeshine man, as he prepared to attend the mass prayer protest. “It’s a basic right, is it not?”'"
"'11-04-22,'0','Some employees will be able to move into other jobs with Nokia, Mr. Elop said, and Nokia may have openings as a result of its partnership with Microsoft. Because of those opportunities, Nokia said it could guarantee employment to its existing employees through this year.Nokia also confirmed that it had signed its agreement with Microsoft to obtain the Windows operating system for Nokia’s smartphones. The two companies announced the partnership on Feb. 11. Since then, Nokia’s stock price has fallen by about a third.The cost-cutting initiative came as Nokia lost its lead in cellphone revenue to Apple, the research firm Strategy Analytics said on Thursday, according to Reuters.Nokia’s phone revenue fell to $9.4 billion in the last quarter, while Apple’s revenue from the iPhone increased to $11.9 billion, the research firm said.“With strong volumes and high wholesale prices, the PC vendor has successfully captured revenue leadership of the total handset market in less than four years,” Alex Spektor, an analyst, said.Nokia also reported Thursday that its profit fell slightly, to 344 million euros ($497 million) in the first quarter from 349 million euros ($504 million) in the period a year earlier.Sales rose 9.2 percent, to 10.4 billion euros ($15.0 billion), in large part because of gains in Latin America and China, where Nokia’s sales rose 29 percent and 30 percent respectively. Sales in North America fell 36 percent, and sales in Europe fell 5 percent.Nokia said its sales of smartphones rose 13 percent in the quarter, to 24.2 million units from 21.5 million. The market grew 74 percent over all during the same time, Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with the International Data Corporation in London, said.On top of that, the average selling price fell 6 percent in the same period, to 147 euros from 155 euros a year earlier, Nokia said.The company said it had sold 108.5 million cellphones of all types during the quarter, 1 percent more than a year ago. Yet its global share of the cellphone market fell to 32 percent from 34 percent a year ago, according to I.D.C.Mikko Ervasti, an analyst at Evli Bank, a private bank in Helsinki, said the cuts in operating expenses were needed to bring Nokia in line with its cellphone peers, like Apple, which on average spend only half or even less on research and development than Nokia does.Mr. Ervasti said the cost-cutting could translate into 6,000 fewer jobs in its cellphone research and development work force, or roughly 38 percent of Nokia’s total staff for mobile phones. Those employees are now working in Finland, China, India, Germany, England, Denmark and San Diego.“These cuts were needed and are in line with what the market was expecting,” Mr. Ervasti said. “This is a direct consequence of the Microsoft agreement, and Nokia’s own need to trim expenses.”'"

"'11-04-22,'0','Aside from the city’s efforts to curb smoking, Mr. Bloomberg said the heating oil regulations were “the single biggest step that we’ve taken to save lives.”Under the new rule, by 2015, existing boilers must switch from No. 6 oil to a low-sulfur version of the No. 4 heating oil or to an equivalent cleaner fuel. Any newly installed boiler would have to burn an even less polluting grade — low-sulfur No. 2 oil — or natural gas or an equivalent low-emission fuel, which would in effect eventually phase out No. 4 oil.Boilers not replaced by 2030 would need to be modified to meet the new regulations.Building owners said the biggest challenge in making the conversion was cost, particularly for smaller buildings in these tough economic times.In a statement, the Real Estate Board of New York said it would work with the Bloomberg administration “to identify and implement ways to achieve those goals in an expeditious and sensible manner.”The organization has previously noted that compliance costs will be borne by tenants in the form of higher rents or maintenance charges.It will cost about $10,000 or less to convert boilers to use No. 4 oil — and much more to switch to No. 2 oil or natural gas. City officials said buildings that demonstrated a severe financial hardship could seek an extended schedule for complying.More than 200 public schools are among the buildings that must make the switch.The phase-out, when fully in effect, will reduce the amount of fine particles emitted by heating buildings by at least 63 percent and lower the overall concentration of fine particles in the city’s air from all sources by 5 percent.“The health benefits will be dramatic,” said Andy Darrell, the New York regional director for the Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group that will work with the city to educate building owners about the conversions.In an address on the eve of Earth Day, Mr. Bloomberg presented the first update to PlaNYC, which calls for such revisions every four years.Speaking at Harlem Stage, a performing arts site inside Harlem’s Gatehouse, to an audience of city officials, environmental groups and others who helped update the plan, the mayor also announced the start of a new nonprofit corporation, the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation, that will use $37 million in federal money to make loans to building owners for energy-efficiency upgrades.'"
"'11-04-22,'0','On Thursday, the former presidential candidate who is the protest leader, Kizza Besigye, was bundled into a police van and taken to court within minutes of stepping onto a Kampala street. But unlike his previous arrests during the protest movement, Mr. Besigye was not granted bail on Thursday, and was later whisked away to a prison far outside of the city.Norbert Mao, another jailed former presidential candidate who is leading protests, was transferred to the same prison outside of Kampala, indicating a growing sensitivity on the part of the government to the politicians’ provocations and influence.Until Thursday, the protesters in Kampala seemed only as bold as the senior politicians often at the front of the march. But with the leaders jailed, the demonstrations on Thursday grew on their own and evolved into a violent parade of protesters, some holding up banners attacking government corruption, and many with rocks.“The situation is pushing us,” said Jamo Luyombya, 24, a day laborer. “They are controlling us with the power of the gun, but not with their power of love.”In Kampala, heavily armed soldiers and police officers fought running street battles with stone-wielding protesters through a popular market as thousands stood on rooftops and balconies to watch.In the town of Masaka, far from journalists covering the protests in Kampala, a 2-year-old was killed after being shot in the chest and head when the police opened fire with live ammunition near a crowd of unarmed protesters, according to Ugandan news reports.Many more were reported wounded in Masaka, and two police officers were hospitalized after being severely beaten by protesters there, the police said. A news report said that the two officers had died on the way to the hospital.“The Ugandan government must immediately end the excessive use of force against protesters,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Thursday. “The police have a duty to protect themselves and uphold the law, but it is completely unacceptable to fire live ammunition at peaceful protesters.”The events could prove pivotal for a movement that so far has failed to gain the same momentum and social cohesion as protests over similar concerns in northern Africa.“The rioting shows that people need change of government,” said Annek Cabine, a bystander at the market where the protest came through. “Otherwise, this problem could become like Libya.”But many still see the protest movement as contrived, propped up by politicians bitter over brutal electoral losses. Others wonder whether it has a chance of displacing Mr. Museveni, who has been in power for a quarter-century.“The key to regime change is of course the army,” said Dr. Elliot Green, a Uganda specialist at the London School of Economics, who said that Mr. Museveni had “done well” in keeping the army “in his pocket.”But Dr. Green said Africa had a long history of urban food riots that brought down governments.“Obviously the current situation in Burkina Faso should also worry Museveni, where a riot by soldiers was sparked by a food riot,” said Dr. Green. “Museveni has a lot to be worried about.”'"
"'11-04-22,'0','“G.E. health care, transportation and aviation delivered strong results,” Mr. Immelt said. “Strategic investments in high-growth segments have strengthened the company’s energy portfolio and position that business to return to growth in the second half of this year.”Over all, revenue rose 6 percent, to $38.45 billion in the first quarter, exceeding analysts forecasts of $34.64 billion. Revenue in the same quarter a year ago was $36.2 billion.The results and outlook reflected the company’s efforts to diversify and make acquisitions, while trying to build its businesses in crucial sectors like energy. On Thursday, the company described itself as “cautiously optimistic” about the gas turbine business, with strong orders from the Middle East and plans to help Japan meet its energy demands after its nuclear plant was damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.“Our teams are working diligently to support our customers in Japan,” Mr. Immelt said in a conference call.Early this month G.E. announced plans to build the nation’s largest photovoltaic panel factory, with the goal of becoming a major player in the market.G.E. also completed the sale of 51 percent of NBC Universal to the Comcast cable network in the quarter, which resulted in an after-tax gain of 4 cents a share. In the deal, Comcast paid General Electric nearly $6.2 billion in cash and contributed its pay television channels like E Entertainment Television and the Golf Channel, worth $7.25 billion, to NBC Universal.General Electric said when announcing its last results in January that it had a backlog of orders that positioned it for growth in 2011, with the transportation, health care and finance units expected to lead in earnings. On Thursday, Mr. Immelt said the backlog, a gauge of future results, was $177 billion.Richard Tortoriello, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said the orders numbers suggested growth in the global economy, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, China and India.“G.E. is a bellwether in the sense that they are one of the largest industrial companies out there, but they have a larger proportion of what you might call long cycle business than others,” Mr. Tortoriello said.“We are not taking off like a rocket ship,” he said, “especially with regard to the U.S. and Europe, but the growth is there.”The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny, to 15 cents, beginning in the third quarter, the report said. It increased its dividend twice in 2010. In July, the dividend was raised to 12 cents a share from 10 cents, and in December it was increased further, to 14 cents. The company paid 31 cents a share until February 2009, when, for the first time since the Great Depression, the board cut the dividend to conserve cash.Timothy A. Hoyle, a vice president at Haverford Investments, said the potential for a dividend increase was apparent in 2010 as the company’s capital unit returned to normal and as it finished a deal involving the sale of NBC Universal. “We saw plenty of excess capital generation,” Mr. Hoyle said. “That is happening.”But he also noted that G.E. had said it had a decline to 14.3 percent in industrial operating margins because of weakness in the energy sector, partly as a result of lower wind turbine pricing.The company’s shares fell 45 cents, or 2.21 percent, to close at $19.95 on Thursday.While G.E. is a household name as a manufacturer of common household products like lights bulbs and electric fans, it also has a diverse portfolio of finance and business units.Its lending division, GE Capital, the nation’s largest nonbank financial institution, has provided more than half of G.E.’s profit in some recent years. But the unit was struggling amid the fallout from the collapse of the real estate market, and Mr. Immelt has tried to refocus G.E. more toward the industrial sector.The company said GE Capital reported net income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up from $583 million in the period a year ago.“With losses having peaked, we are originating new business at attractive margins and our funding costs continue to be favorable,” Mr. Immelt said of GE Capital.'"

"'11-04-23,'0','It further enshrines the destructive pop culture dogma that fame and fortune grant moral wiggle room to flout the rules and obscure the truth.And, yes, it further plays to the heavy racial undertones that have marked this presidency. (This was underscored in the ugliest of ways last week when Marilyn Davenport, a activist, sent an e-mail containing an Obama “family portrait,” portraying them as apes under the phrase, “Now you know why no birth certificate.”)I first met Donald Trump a couple of months ago at a cocktail party. Someone introduced us, and he immediately started in on a speech about how beloved he was among blacks. He said that everywhere he went, blacks were telling him to run for president and that some hip-hop stars had told him that he was the most popular white man among black people. (He reiterated this point last week, which was published in amNew York, claiming, “I’ve always had a great relationship with the blacks.”)I was stunned — a smirk frozen on my face. Why this speech? Why me?He had made a quick racial calculation and gone for it. And, in some ways, he was right.Yes, I am obviously black. Yes, I follow politics. And, yes, I am a fan of hip-hop — so much so that a line from Lauryn Hill’s seminal 1998 work sprang to mind: “Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves.” But the egalitarian intellectual in me chafed. These were exactly the kind of racial assumptions and panderings that I despise.Trump has made the same racial calculation about the right, and he’s again going for it. Only there aren’t enough of them chafing, and too many are cheering. It fits with and affirms their desire to delegitimize this president by any means necessary.In a way, Trump is simply doing what Trump does: recognizing a branding opportunity and playing the part to seize it while simultaneously basking in the glow of his own narcissistic neurosis.As the character Jack Driscoll says in the 2005 remake of “ ”: “Actors! They travel the world, all they ever see is a mirror.” Trump is worse still — a combination of the self-absorbed actor and the B-movie creature that some in the audience root for but most revile — a kind of King Combover.He’s a little man with little to lose. But the right is making itself smaller by applauding him, and, in so doing, forfeiting what little moral and intellectual standing that they have left.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','Just as he likes it, Jeter has played all but two of the Yankees’ 1442/3 innings this season, sitting out the final two innings of their second game, on April 2, because they were leading by seven runs. Jeter was one of four shortstops to start at least 150 games last season, when he hit a career-low .270. Jeter’s struggles have continued, with a .219 average and just 1 of his 14 hits going for extra bases, but he is hardly tired. Still, despite his competitiveness, Jeter says he understands that receiving days off during long stretches — or the hotter weather of summer — could help him.“It’s not like I get many days off,” Jeter said. “It’s not like I want them, either.”MIXED REACTION ON PLAYOFFS Commissioner Bud Selig’s acknowledgment Thursday that the playoffs would almost certainly expand next season from 8 teams to 10 drew a mixed reaction in the Yankees’ clubhouse, with players generally favoring the addition of an extra wild-card spot in each league while wondering how the new format would look.The expansion, subject to collective bargaining with the players union, would match the two wild-card teams against each other in a series whose length would be determined.“The more teams you keep involved in the races, the better for baseball,” said Joe Girardi, who also expressed concern that too many days off immediately after the season could be a disadvantage to the division winners. Girardi thought that adding another playoff team, and thus an extra series, would compel contending teams to pursue the division title instead of settling for the wild card.Curtis Granderson supported the plan but said he was leery about the postseason possibly extending into November, as it did in 2009 and could have last year. This year’s playoffs are assured of ending in October.“There’s a lot of potential, good and question marks, that can come from doing this,” Granderson said.In three of the last four seasons, one-game playoffs have been required to determine playoff spots, and Granderson, who played for Detroit in a one-game playoff against Minnesota in 2009, wondered how those games would be scheduled. From a competitive standpoint, Derek Jeter said he liked the concept, as long as division winners were rewarded, but he shared Girardi’s concern of having too long a layoff between playoff games.“In theory, it sounds like a good idea,” Jeter said, “but I think a lot of kinks would have to be worked out first.”HUGHES WAITS A DAY The steady rain Friday afternoon forced Phil Hughes to push back his scheduled bullpen session to Saturday, when he planned to throw three simulated 15-pitch innings. If the Yankees sense that his arm strength has sufficiently improved, Hughes could begin a minor-league rehabilitation assignment next week. ... C. C.

Robert M. Waterman, the pastor of Antioch. “The people who show up here know they have done something.

"'11-04-23,'0','Today, the county is broke; according to The Birmingham News, it may run out of cash by July. It is toying with a bankruptcy filing — which, if it happened, would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in history.Though the county no longer has to pay fees to JPMorgan — the bank agreed to void the swaps as part of a settlement with the — its bond debt for the sewers now totals almost $4 billion. The Birmingham News described Jefferson County as a “poster child” for all that can go wrong when municipalities start playing with unregulated derivatives peddled by Wall Street sharpies.Has Spencer Bachus, as the local congressman, decried this debacle? Of course — what local congressman wouldn’t? In a letter last year to Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., he said that the county’s financing schemes “magnified the inherent risks of the municipal finance market.” (He also blamed, among other things, “serious corruption,” of which there was plenty, including secret payments by JPMorgan to people who could influence the county commissioners.)Bachus is not just your garden variety local congressman, though. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, he is uniquely positioned to help make sure that similar disasters never happen again — not just in Jefferson County but anywhere. After all, the new Dodd-Frank financial reform law will, at long last, regulate derivatives. And the implementation of that law is being overseen by Bachus and his committee.Among its many provisions related to derivatives — all designed to lessen their systemic risk — is a series of rules that would make it close to impossible for the likes of JPMorgan to pawn risky derivatives off on municipalities. Dodd-Frank requires sellers of derivatives to take a near-fiduciary interest in the well-being of a municipality.You would think Bachus would want these regulations in place as quickly as possible, given the pain his constituents are suffering. Yet, last week, along with a handful of other House Republican bigwigs, he introduced legislation that would do just the opposite: It would delay derivative regulation until January 2013.It is hard not to see this move as an act of hostility toward any derivative regulation. After all, by 2013 a presidential election will have taken place, and if the Republicans take the White House and the Senate, one can expect that the next step would be to roll back derivative regulation entirely. Even if it is just about delay, rather than outright obstruction, that means the Republicans are asking for two more years during which the industry will add trillions of dollars worth of “financial weapons of mass destruction” (to use Warren Buffett’s famous description) to the $466.8 trillion of unregulated derivatives already in existence. How can this possibly be good?I tried to ask this question of Bachus, but I was told he was unavailable. I asked his staff if he believed, after the experience of Jefferson County, that derivatives should be regulated at all. I couldn’t get an answer.I’ll keep trying. It’s not just an answer his constituents deserve to hear. Given the risks derivatives still pose, it’s something the nation needs to know about Chairman Bachus. If he decides to tell me, I promise to pass it on.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','The increases have not been imposed from rack to rack. Retailers and analysts say stores are testing to see where customers will accept higher prices. Will shoppers accept more expensive jeans, but revolt if the price of T-shirts rises? Will they stop buying socks if the price goes up by 50 cents? What about $3?Gauging customers’ reactions could help retailers avoid errors in pricing when they make widespread changes in the autumn. At American Eagle, “there are areas within the categories that we do believe that we can take prices up,” said Roger S. Markfield, vice chairman and executive creative director, in the company’s March conference call. “In the right items, the customer responds as though there was no price increase.”“In the areas where we have tested and it is not possible, we will not do that,” he said.Aéropostale, too, has begun increasing prices selectively, executives said on its fourth-quarter conference call.“Like us, some of our peers are testing different things and testing higher prices, and primarily in preparation for the back half of the year,” Thomas P. Johnson, the chief executive of Aéropostale, said. “However, there is still uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment and the consumers’ response to higher prices.” Right now, a long-sleeved Ralph Lauren men’s shirt costs $95, up from $89, an increase of about 7 percent, while a women’s gingham oxford at J. Crew costs $72, up from $69.50 a year ago, an increase of nearly 4 percent.Janney Capital Markets follows prices and promotions at a group of specialty retailers. In mid-April of last year, it noted that Charlotte Russe was selling swimwear at $14.50 and up. Now, swimsuits sell for $16.50 and up.Flip-flops at The Children’s Place had been two for $5, and now are two for $6.Bullhead-brand jeans for girls at Pacific Sunwear were two for $55 last year, Janney said. Now, they are two for $59.And cotton underwear at Soma Intimates, once five for $25, now sell for five for $25.50.Like Soma, other retailers are hiding higher prices in complicated promotions. The teenage retailer Zumiez, for instance, went from an offer of three T-shirts and two pairs of jeans for $85, to two T-shirts and two pairs of jeans for $80. (Hopefully its customers have already taken algebra.)While virtually all retailers have said that prices will climb in 2011, across-the-board price increases have not yet been reflected in the Consumer Price Index. In March, apparel and jewelry prices were 0.5 percent below where they had been in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.Though retailers were expecting more outrage, shoppers so far do not seem put off by the increases.“A number of them seemed encouraged that customers weren’t backing away as of yet,” said John Long, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon. “They hadn’t encountered much in the way of resistance, which they found surprising.”At The Children’s Place, which recently changed the standard ending on its items from X.50 to X.95, customers “didn’t really even notice in these early rounds,” Mr. Morris of BMO Capital Markets said.Although shoppers are taking the hit on the higher prices for now, Mr. Morris said the tactic could be smart for the retailers.“In a way, that’s not a bad strategy because their customer is less likely to have sticker shock when they really have to ratchet up come the third quarter,” he said.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) — Samsung Electronics filed a patent lawsuit on Friday against Apple over the iPhone and iPad in a tit-for-tat case after Apple claimed Samsung’s smartphones and tablets “slavishly” copied its products.Apple filed a lawsuit last Friday accusing Samsung of violating patents and trademarks of its iPhone and iPad, as the popular gadgets are being threatened by the fast rise of rival devices based on Google’s free Android operating system.The legal battle could jeopardize business ties between the two technology companies. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., relies heavily on Samsung for components like chips and LCD displays.Operating systems have emerged as the crucial battlefield for dominance of the world’s smartphone market. Android became the most popular smartphone software in the United States in the three months ending in February, ahead of the software of Apple and Research In Motion, according to a recent survey by research firm comScore.Samsung is one of the fastest-growing smartphone makers on the back of the Android boom and has emerged as Apple’s strongest competitor in the tablet market, with models in three sizes.'"

To the contrary, in many ways sex discrimination in Yemen is sanctioned both by law and in practice.The Personal Status Law calls for wife obedience, allows marital rape, reinforces stereotypes about women’s roles as caretakers within the home and severely restricts women’s freedom of movement. The recent remarks made by President Ali Abdullah Saleh condemning women’s participation in public protests as being un-Islamic reflects the secondary status given to Yemeni women.The Yemeni government must not only repeal all discriminatory provisions in its law, but also take steps to end discrimination by enacting laws that will protect women and girls, like setting a minimum age for marriage and supporting women’s equal participation in public life.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','Democratic-dominated boards often tilt toward unions and reverse the decisions of Republican-leaning boards, which usually tilt toward management, and vice versa. The current board — made up of three Democrats and one Republican, with one vacancy — is expected to reverse a Bush-era decision that stripped graduate teaching assistants at private universities of their right to bargain collectively. Labor experts also predict that the board will adopt a policy that makes it easier to organize nursing home workers by allowing unions to go after smaller units of workers inside those homes.The biggest surprise has been the activist stance taken by Mr. Solomon, a career civil servant at the board for 39 years. He became acting general counsel in June 2010, and President Obama nominated him to be the permanent general counsel last January. The Senate has not yet confirmed him to the post.In the Boeing case, Mr. Solomon charged that the company had illegally moved some production work of the 787 Dreamliner passenger plane to South Carolina to punish workers for past strikes and to avoid future ones. The remedy proposed by Mr. Solomon has been denounced as extreme by many business leaders: that Boeing move the work back to its unionized Puget Sound facilities, after it made a $2 billion investment and hired 1,000 nonunion workers in South Carolina.Outraged, the National Association of Manufacturers warned that if the agency won this case, “no company will be safe from the N.L.R.B. stepping in to second-guess its business decisions on where to expand.”Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican, complained, “This is nothing more than a political favor for the unions who are supporting President Obama’s re-election campaign.”The Boeing case was not the first time that Mr. Solomon has riled the business community and its Republican allies. Saying it is the domain of the federal government, he recently threatened to sue four Republican-heavy states — Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah — in an effort to invalidate recent constitutional amendments that prohibit private sector workers from choosing a union by signing cards, a process known as card check.He has also sought to extend the labor board’s reach into the world of the Internet. He approved requests from regional labor board officials to bring complaints against businesses that punished employees for Facebook and Twitter posts, including one case against Reuters. Mr. Solomon has also proposed that electronic voting be used when workers decide whether they want to unionize their workplace — a proposal that business groups maintain will make it easier for unions to coerce workers.In an interview, Mr. Solomon, a 61-year-old Arkansas native, insisted that he was no radical.“My goal is to enforce the National Labor Relations Act,” he said. That law, enacted in 1935, governs private sector workers’ right to unionize as well as relations between tens of thousands of companies and employees.Mr. Solomon, who has worked for board members of both parties, said this case was straightforward: Boeing had retaliated against workers for exercising their federally protected right to strike. “They had a consistent message that they were doing this to punish their employees for having struck and having the power to strike in the future,” he said. “I can’t not issue a complaint in the face of such evidence.”While the spotlight is on Mr. Solomon at the moment, people inside the agency and out expect that attention will soon move to the five-member board, whose decisions often have broad effect, much like court precedents.Marshall Babson, a Democratic member of the board under President Reagan, said the board had “teed up a lot of important issues for consideration.” He said its behavior had been more moderate than the Reagan board, which, he recalls, reversed about two dozen pro-union decisions in one year.The Obama board is expected to reverse a Bush-era decision that lets workers petition to decertify a union within days of a company’s recognizing a union through card check. That new ruling would most likely restore the old requirement that workers had to wait a year before trying to oust their union.“The current majority views its role as promoting unionization in the private sector,” said Peter Schaumber, a Bush appointee who stepped down from the board in August.Lynn Rhinehart, the general counsel for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., applauds many of the board’s recent moves and wishes it would do far more. “A lot of what they’ve done is pretty routine,” she said. “I think the allegations of activism are pretty overblown.”Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said employers were expecting a series of unfavorable rulings. “Many decisions are still in the pipeline, and we think where those are going to wind up is clear,” he said.The chamber opposes a proposal that would require all private sector employers to post notices explaining workers’ rights to unionize. It also faulted the board for being more aggressive about reinstating pro-union workers who are illegally fired during unionization drives.Samuel Estreicher, a labor law professor at New York University, said that, so far, the Obama board’s actions had not been out of line. “I don’t buy into the accusations that they’re doing something crazy,” he said.Nonetheless, he criticized Mr. Solomon’s complaint against Boeing, saying that companies vulnerable to strikes — like the 56-day walkout against Boeing in 2008 — should be able to move operations while explaining to employees that strikes hurt profits and production.Boeing has called the case “legally frivolous” and “a radical departure from both N.L.R.B. and Supreme Court precedent.”Mr. Solomon dismissed accusations that he was following President Obama’s wishes in bringing the Boeing case, saying he had had no conversations with the White House about it.Mr. Solomon said he was just a “career person” enforcing the law. “I feel that I really had no choice,” he said.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','This year’s United States Chess Championships, which are being held in St. Louis, have produced some expected results, but there have also been surprises.The pretournament favorites, including the defending champions among the men and women, have qualified for the semifinals, which start Saturday. But two upstarts have also qualified and one top player was eliminated in tie-breaker games on Friday.Unlike last year, the men’s and women’s tournaments are being held concurrently. The men’s field had 16 players and was divided into two preliminary groups, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. The preliminaries were round robins, meaning each competitor faced all the others in his group once.In the A group, Gata Kamsky, the defending champion, was the top qualifier, winning three games and drawing four. Yuri Shulman, the 2008 champion and No. 2 seed, joined him in the semifinals by winning twice and drawing his other games.Ray Robson, a 16-year-old grandmaster, finished third. He also won twice, but a loss in Round 5 to Daniel Naroditsky, a 15-year-old international master, was the difference.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','Charlotte B. Beyer, founder and chief executive of the Institute for Private Investors, said her members were now screening eight to 10 advisers when they used to meet with two or three.“That’s an enormous difference and an enormous time commitment,” Ms. Beyer said.While wealthy investors may have made a lot of money and surely understand how complex the world is, they are just as afraid as anyone else of getting this choice wrong. So how do you pick the right adviser without being overwhelmed by the process?TYPICAL MISTAKES Regardless of wealth, people make the same mistakes in selecting advisers.Listening to family and friends for suggestions on money management — or, worse, picking family and friends to do it — can be a bad idea. First, there is no correlation between your sense about a person and that person’s ability to do a good job. Remember all the people who felt such affection for Bernard L. Madoff? And second, hiring a friend or relative makes firing that person tough.Rushing the process is another mistake. Picking a financial adviser can be as serious as selecting a doctor, and it certainly should require more time than picking a paint color. But for many investors, even those who had to make tough decisions in business, it is about as interesting as watching that paint dry.“People don’t interview enough people on the front end,” said Jim Grubman, owner of FamilyWealth Consulting, which works with advisers. “They’ll take someone else’s recommendations. What works for your friend or your colleague may not be the best fit for you.”Relying on a name brand firm can be just as bad as going with someone you know. But selecting a boutique firm in the belief that smaller size means more attention for clients can be equally problematic.“Our belief is there are exceptional advisers spread across all different types of platforms, but there are no great firms,” Mr. Black said.QUESTIONS TO ASK Picking an adviser is an awful lot like choosing a spouse: you really want the relationship to last forever, to be rewarding and fulfilling, but if it happens to fall apart, you don’t want that to destroy you.Mr. Black, whose firm is paid either a fixed fee or a percentage of assets for continuing monitoring, said he asked 18 questions of all firms and 17 of advisers. For firms, some of the major questions involve how the organization functions, its experience and risk-management practices and how it handles problems that arise.For advisers, the criteria are a mix of set standards and questions. He will not work with any adviser who has fewer than seven years’ experience. One thing he found when he worked at UBS was that it generally took at least seven years for any financial malfeasance to surface. He said he also wanted to make sure that the adviser’s firm had broad experience with clients whose wealth levels were similar to his own client’s.Yet, he said, the value his firm will bring to the selection process may be in the questions that do not have simple yes or no answers. The 17 criteria for advisers are listed on the firm’s Web site.One simple statistic he looks at is how much additional money an adviser’s existing clients are asking him or her to manage. Mr. Black said most very wealthy people had several advisers from various stages in their lives. But the one who is doing the best job — as opposed to the friend from high school — is the one who gets the new money they are making.Yet even lawyers and accountants who take the typical approach of making introductions to wealth advisers are aware that the complexity of both individual investments and the global economy requires more voices, not fewer.David Scott Sloan, co-chairman of private wealth services at the law firm Holland & Knight, said he encouraged clients with substantial wealth to set up committees of advisers. This helps with selecting new advisers but also makes pushing out an old one easier.“By putting the team of advisers together, the weak link will reveal itself,” he said. “Even though it might be a friend, this is where the team of advisers can work.”THE RIGHT CHOICE While experts can surely be wrong, individual investors often select advisers whom they like personally, whether or not those advisers have the best money management skills.You have to accept that this will happen. “What you’re searching for is someone who has similar convictions,” said G. Scott Budge, managing director at RayLign Advisory, a consultant to wealthy families. “We know from being skeptics of everything that moves that there are many ways to do this and they all don’t work at some point. This is not about finding perfection. This is about finding a good relationship.”This may sound akin to accepting that human nature will once again subject you to the vicissitudes of the market. Ms. Beyer of the Institute for Private Investors says that one way to reduce the effect of personality is to create a simple chart to weigh the pros and cons of everyone being interviewed.Others advise against the temptation to pit advisers against one another in a horse race, giving each a sum of money and seeing, after a period of time, who gets the best return.. “People put up with an amazing number of bad relationships because they think they have to get a few extra points of performance,” Mr. Grubman said. “What we found in the bear markets is as soon as that performance goes down, the relationship falls apart. Investment performance only works when it’s stellar, and that’s not sustainable.”One objective measure of an adviser is the difference between what is promised and what is delivered. Mr. Black calls this the “sales gap.” It allows clients to measure what they were promised when an adviser was courting them against how those promises have played out.Knowing some gap will always exist requires investors to remain vigilant — even if they’d rather be doing something else.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','Late Friday evening, D’Antoni looked to console Stoudemire after Game 3 ended in the same fashion as so many recent regular-season games: boos, a blowout loss and dire playoff hopes.“It’ll be tough, but he’ll be ready,” D’Antoni said. “It’s tough. The guy has been on a bed for two days and I just marvel that he gets out and he wanted to play.”Moments later, Stoudemire arrived at the postgame podium and sounded less optimistic about Sunday’s Game 4. He will most likely play; just as likely, the pain will still be there.“There’s no way I will be 100 percent by Sunday,” Stoudemire said. “Tonight, I knew I wasn’t 100 percent, but I also knew my teammates needed me out there.”He sat in a chair and answered questions, an improvement over Game 2, when the pain flared during warm-ups. After the game, Stoudemire answered questions while standing.On Friday, Stoudemire took eight shots, made two, and was a team-worst minus-32 on the court. As Allen swirled around screens like a sports car hugging a tight curve, Pierce found his sweet spots and Rajon Rondo handed out 20 assists, Stoudemire could not offer much help.He warmed up before the game, stretched and gave reporters a thumbs up as he went back to the locker room. The moment was less dramatic, important or impactful than Willis Reed’s return in Game 7 of the 1970 finals, but he still gave the Knicks an emotional lift when the game started.“I was very ginger; I didn’t really want to draw any contact,” he said. “Quick moves weren’t quite there. I couldn’t make any sharp, quick moves. It bothered my elevation and driving to the basket.”With just under nine minutes left, Stoudemire rose from his seat with an oversized cushion similar to the one used by Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, who has back problems, and reported for duty. For one of the few times this season, his presence had no impact. D’Antoni removed Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony with 3 minutes 45 seconds remaining and the Knicks trailing, 106-84.The series is presenting D’Antoni with plenty of second-guessing. Shawne Williams scored a team-high 17 points and will replace Stoudemire in the lineup if the pain is intolerable or if D’Antoni judges him ineffective. But as long as Stoudemire is willing to play, D’Antoni will probably be behind the player who is the largest reason for the end of the Knicks’ playoff drought.“His heart is in a great place,” D’Antoni said of Stoudemire and reiterated hopefully: “He gave us everything he’s got. His body is a little bit dead, but he’ll be ready on Sunday.”'"
"'11-04-23,'0','BEIJING — The United States and China will have their annual meeting on human rights next week, but there are signs that the session may be more tense than usual.According to a statement issued by the State Department, the two sides are to meet Wednesday and Thursday in Beijing for what has become a regular springtime meeting on human rights.But the statement was highly unusual for several reasons, not least because Washington made the announcement for a meeting to be held in Beijing — which runs counter to diplomatic protocol — and because it was made just days before the event.Indeed, the Chinese government confirmed the meeting late Friday only after repeated calls to the Foreign Ministry. A day earlier, a ministry spokesman said details still had to be “discussed and arranged.”“Objectively speaking, the announcement is being made at the last minute,” said Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua Foundation, a rights group in Hong Kong. “It’s also interesting that the U.S. is making it unilaterally and that they’re using this language.”'"
"'11-04-23,'0','He of the long beard and wire-rim glasses and Yiddish-inflected English, a man by all outward appearances belonging to the Old World, he was the person who by geographical coincidence and unexpected perspicacity adapted Coca-Cola’s secret formula to make the iconic soft drink kosher in one version for Passover and in another for the rest of the year. To this day, his 1935 rabbinical ruling, known in Hebrew as a teshuva, remains the standard.That ruling, in turn, did much more than solve a dietary problem. A generation after Frank’s lynching, a decade after Congress barred the Golden Door, amid the early stages of Hitler’s genocide, kosher Coke formed a powerful symbol of American Jewry’s place in the mainstream.“Rabbi Geffen really got the importance of it,” said Marcie Cohen Ferris, a professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina, who specializes in Jewish life in the South. “You couldn’t live in any better place than the South to get it. To not drink Coca-Cola was certainly to be considered un-American.”Or look at the interplay of Jews and America from another angle. Rabbi Geffen’s solution to the Coke problem was not to forget the kosher rules and melt into the melting pot. But neither was it to decry the spiritual pollution of modernity in the form of a fizzy drink. A half-century before the era of cultural pluralism, his answer was to have the majority address the distinct needs of a minority.As a contemporary Orthodox rabbi, Adam Mintz, has written in an essay on Geffen and Coke: “Struggling to find their place in a land that was often hostile to their religion, American Jews respected and appreciated rabbis who sought to include them within the Orthodox camp rather than simply condemn them as sinners. Of course his approach would not have been possible had he not felt confident in his powers of persuasion.”We can safely say, however, that this issue chose Rabbi Geffen rather than the other way around. As early as 1925, as the Orthodox authority in Coke’s home city, he was receiving inquiries from other rabbis about the drink’s kosher status. A few other rabbis had already given certification, without knowing the secret formula. And multitudes of American Jews were drinking Coke regardless.“Because it has become an insurmountable problem to induce the great majority of Jews to refrain from partaking of this drink,” Rabbi Geffen wrote in his teshuva, “I have tried earnestly to find a method of permitting its usage. With the help of God, I have been able to uncover a pragmatic solution.”Putting aside God’s props for a moment, we should note that Rabbi Geffen had some significant earthly help in the person of Harold Hirsch, a Jewish Atlantan who was Coca-Cola’s corporate lawyer. Through Hirsch, Rabbi Geffen was permitted to enter that industry’s Holy of Holies and receive Coke’s secret formula.With it, the rabbi was able to identify the elements that rendered Coke nonkosher during the bulk of the year (oil of glycerine derived from beef tallow) and specifically during Passover (a corn derivative). Hiding the exact ingredients behind Hebrew euphemisms in his teshuva, Rabbi Geffen explained the needed corrections. Glycerine could be replaced by coconut or cottonseed oils, and the corn derivative by cane or beet sugars.Kosher-for-Passover Coke is now produced under rabbinic supervision at bottling plants serving Jewish population centers in New York, Florida, Southern California and Houston, among other areas. A number of other major brands have followed Coke into the Passover market: Dannon, Lipton, Pepsi and Tropicana. There are tequila and blintzes made without forbidden grains.“It used to be that for Pesach you were limited to matza and hard-boiled eggs,” said Rabbi Menachem Genack, the head of the Orthodox Union’s kosher-certification program. “Now, I’ve got to tell you, I love those cheese blintzes.”And, whether devout or debauched, Coke fans anticipate Passover for their own cultish reason: the usual sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, is replaced by cane or beet sugar.Moshe Feder, an editor of science-fiction and fantasy books, traveled to six supermarkets from his home in Queens before finding four two-liter bottles of Passover Coke. The subject of his quest happened to come up at a seder the other night. The host, a Jewish man, had never heard about the difference between Coke and Passover Coke. But two Roman Catholic guests, Mr. Feder reported, “knew all about it.”Rabbi Geffen, of blessed memory, who’d have guessed you were so ecumenical?'"
"'11-04-23,'0','While the company does not break down earnings by brand, revenue in its main watch and jewelry division rose 28 percent last year at constant exchange rates, compared with an increase of 8 percent in revenue in its parts production business, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue.Still, Mr. Hayek is pushing to change the modus operandi in his sector, from tightening rules on what defines a watch as “made in Switzerland” to forcing rivals to make their own components. Swatch has been talking with competition regulators about how far it could cut back its supply business, without endangering manufacturers that rely on Swatch parts.“People assume that it’s a good business to sell components, but the only really attractive business is to sell finished products of our brands,” he said. “We are in a ridiculous situation that would be like having BMW supply all the engines for Audi and Mercedes. In no other industry do you have one company supply all the critical parts to the people who then compete directly with it.”Swatch’s withdrawal as a supplier would be a sea change for the sector. As a result, such a move “cannot happen overnight,” said Jean-Frédéric Dufour, chief executive of Zenith, which is owned by the French group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is one of the few Swiss brands that does not buy from Swatch.Still, Mr. Dufour said, by forcing rivals to invest more in production, Mr. Hayek “could help bring back the watch sector to how it was operating 100 years ago, when each brand really differentiated itself from others by the quality of its movements.”Swatch’s hegemony over watch production is part of the legacy of Mr. Hayek’s Lebanese-born father, Nicolas, who died last year.As a management consultant, Nicolas Hayek had been hired by banks to close two manufacturers in the early 1980s, at a time when Swiss watchmakers were getting crushed by less expensive Japanese competitors. Instead, he merged and acquired a stake in the struggling companies and revived the industry with the introduction of the inexpensive plastic Swatch watch.The fashion frenzy generated by the colorful Swatches in turn required the group to develop mass volume production, building its leadership by later acquiring more component manufacturers.In terms of volume, Swatch controls 70 to 80 percent of the sector’s watch movement production, according to a research study published last month by the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.The Hayeks own about 35 percent of the group’s equity, ensuring that Swatch remains essentially a family business. Mr. Hayek is joined by his elder sister Nayla as chairwoman, while the next Hayek generation is led by her son, Marc, who had a stint in the restaurant business but now oversees part of the group’s luxury watch business, including the Breguet and Blancpain brands, which Swatch acquired in 1999 and 2000.Nick Hayek, meanwhile, cut his teeth in movies before joining his father at Swatch in 1994, initially in a marketing role. Having studied filmmaking in Paris, he started a production company making documentaries, short movies and two feature films, including “Family Express,” which starred Peter Fonda.Nowadays, his movie-making is limited to occasional involvement in advertising campaigns, but he plays down the suggestion that he was pushed into making a U-turn in his career ambitions.“It might seem that I made a big change from making movies,” he said, “but I am still in the world of creation, and the only real difference between cinema and watches is that the U.S. is No. 1 in cinema, while for watches it is Switzerland.”In an industry where executives tend to emulate the polished look that features in their luxury watch ads, the cigar-puffing Mr. Hayek cuts a different figure, more in tune with the pirate flag that he keeps in his office. The top buttons of his shirt are undone, and one of the sleeves of his suit is rolled up almost to the elbow, revealing a bright turquoise Swatch. In keeping with his father’s habits, he wears a different watch on the other wrist — on that day, a sturdier and darker Omega timepiece.Mr. Hayek takes pride in not having responded to alarmist forecasts and cut back production at the onset of the financial crisis. He also says the United States and other Western nations too quickly abandoned manufacturing that formed the backbone of their economies.“Instead of crying and blaming China for producing goods at a lower cost for the whole world, countries like the U.S., for example, should realize that outsourcing most of the production is a big mistake,” he said.“The success of Switzerland and in particular of its watch industry — not just in the luxury segment — is the proof that entrepreneurship is likely to flourish in a country that believes in maintaining manufacturing and factories, even with a very high cost base. That is something that the U.S. used to understand, but the days of Henry Ford and others are sadly long gone.”Nick Hayek has yet to have as profound and broad an effect on the industrial landscape as his father, who is revered in Switzerland as the savior of the watch industry. Still, other executives suggest there is more to come, particularly given his determination to overhaul production practices.“Anybody who expected that Nick Hayek would disappoint or not manage to step out of his father’s shadow has been proven dead wrong,” said René Beyer, chief executive of Beyer, a watch retailer in Zurich. “He is a real entrepreneur, rather than just a manager, and for that reason I think that he will probably end up doing more for this industry than his father did.”With a cash pile of 1.8 billion francs, Swatch would seem to be in a good position to scoop up some more acquisitions. It is a time of consolidation in the industry: In March, LVMH acquired Bulgari, the Italian jeweler and watchmaker, in a deal worth 3.7 billion euros ( $5.4 billion).Yet Mr. Hayek said he was concentrating on developing the brands that his company already owned. “There might be some more takeover opportunities for us in this industry, but we are not hunting for takeovers,” he said. “We can reach 10 billion francs of sales just by internal growth, and that is our main objective.”Swatch may also buy back more shares, but it is not seeking to delist the company. Still, Mr. Hayek appears to have little time for financial markets, in particular for the scrutiny of analysts. A decade ago, Mr. Hayek abandoned his one and only investor road show after only two days, after meeting with a California pension fund manager who, according to Mr. Hayek, did not even know what brands Swatch owned.“Going on that one terrible road show was a good lesson for me and one that I really don’t want to learn again,” he said. “We sell watches and not shares.”'"
"'11-04-23,'0','LONDON —More than 30 medical workers are missing in Bahrain, an American rights group said Friday, in the latest indication that the country’s health care system is being drawn into Bahrain’s confrontation with pro-democracy campaigners.The group, Physicians for Human Rights, cited reports from Bahrain that “doctors are disappearing as part of a systematic attack on medical staff,” and that “many physicians are missing following interrogations by unknown security forces at Salmaniya Medical Complex” in Bahrain’s capital, Manama.In a Web posting, the group published a list of more than 30 medical personnel, from ambulance drivers to consultants and surgeons, who it said had been held.“Although families have tried to contact administration officials, the administration denies any knowledge of their whereabouts,” the posting said. “According to family members, the physicians are being held incommunicado in unknown locations.”There was no immediate response to the allegation from authorities in Bahrain, which enlisted military help from more than 2,000 troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to put down a pro-democracy uprising last month, and sent army and security forces to crush dissent.'"
"'11-04-23,'0','At a briefing for reporters here on Friday, Akio Toyoda, president and chief executive of Toyota, said he expected to ramp up production gradually in Japan, starting in July, as more parts makers came back on line.Toyota will raise production at its overseas plants a month later, in August, to allow for the parts to arrive from Japan, Mr. Toyoda said.Production at home and overseas will return to predisaster levels at all factory lines and across all vehicle models by November or December, Mr. Toyoda said.“The damage has been so widespread in this unprecedented calamity that its economic effect is being felt throughout Japan and in every industry,” Mr. Toyoda said. He added that the automaker had dispatched employees to help recovery work at some of its most vital parts makers.The severe disruptions come as a painful blow to Toyota just as it had appeared set to shake off the effects of a sharp slowdown in sales after the global economic crisis, as well as its handling of a spate of recalls. The reduced production also highlights a downside to Toyota’s insistence on making almost half of its cars in Japan and shipping them overseas. Also, its celebrated just-in-time production system, which reduces parts inventories to a minimum, may have made the disruptions worse.The automaker estimates that it faces shortages of about 150 critical parts, down from about 500 immediately after the March 11 quake. Atsushi Niimi, executive vice president in charge of production, said that Toyota had switched suppliers in some cases to speed the recovery.He said it had been a bitter revelation to Toyota that its cars, even those produced overseas, still relied so heavily on Japanese parts.“We need to procure more parts overseas, and we also urge our suppliers to make more forays outside Japan,” Mr. Niimi said. He added that Toyota would diversify its supplier base over all to make its supply chain more resilient.“It’s something we don’t want to think about, “ he said, “but it is something we cannot avoid if we are to continue to do business in a quake-prone country.”Mr. Toyoda, the company chief, said continuing aftershocks made the outlook uncertain. He declined to comment on the effect of the disruptions on the company’s earnings.“We just had an aftershock yesterday,” he said. “As these continue, the rapid recovery we’ve seen can come undone. The future is impossible to predict.”Another concern is the severe energy shortage brought by the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, 140 miles north of Tokyo, as well as damage to other power plants in the region.To avert a power supply collapse, the Japanese government initially instructed companies to reduce their energy use by as much as 25 percent. But frantic efforts by utilities to increase power generation at plants outside the worst-hit zones, as well as a public drive to conserve energy, has eased the energy shortfall, allowing the government to lower its directive to 15 percent.Mr. Niimi, the executive vice president for production, said that Toyota was discussing energy-saving measures with other automakers, like shutting production lines during the week and running them on weekends, when more electricity is available.Still, Mr. Toyoda said, the company was committed to keeping production — and jobs — in Japan.“Above all, we all love Japan,” he said. “As we face a national crisis, each company must do its part.”'"
"'11-04-23,'0','“I have met these brave fighters, and they are not Al Qaeda,” said Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona. “They are Libyan patriots who want to liberate their nation.” His comments came after a brief visit that included meetings with the members of the Transitional National Council, led by a former justice minister, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, and a former interior minister, Abdul Fateh Younes, who both defected when the uprising began in February.Mr. McCain’s visit, though coordinated with the White House and the State Department, nonetheless underscored a mounting sense of frustration among critics and even some supporters of the Obama administration that it was not acting aggressively enough to help the rebels overthrow Colonel Qaddafi.Although this week President Obama authorized the use of armed drones in Libya and a $25 million contribution of nonlethal military surplus for the rebel forces, the administration resists deepening the American military involvement. Asked on Thursday whether American soldiers or advisers should be sent to help improve the effectiveness of the rebel forces, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Mr. Obama had explicitly ruled that out. “And there is no wiggle room in that,” he said.Instead, administration officials have pleaded for patience. They said that while it could take weeks or months for the rebels to mature as fighters, they asserted that the operation continued to weaken Colonel Qaddafi’s military and that sanctions and an arms embargo allowed the United States “quite aggressively, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to put the squeeze on Qaddafi,” as the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, put it on Friday.“I think it’s important to remember that Qaddafi’s resources are limited,” Mr. Carney told reporters returning with the president to Washington from California. “And the arms embargo and the sanctions that have been put in place will, as each day goes by, make it harder and harder for him to function and for his regime to function.”Military officials said the greatest shortcoming among the ragtag rebel militias was not weapons but training, communications systems and a sensible command structure. The supplies the United States is sending — including uniforms, body armor and nonclassified communications gear — are suited to building a more effective fighting force. With the anticipated arrival in Libya of liaison officers from France, Italy and Britain, officials expressed hope that the rebels would become better organized and coordinate their battlefield movements more effectively.Even so, Admiral Mullen and other NATO officials acknowledged that an evolving tactic adopted by pro-Qaddafi forces — hiding among the population and moving about the battlefield in civilian vehicles — had vastly complicated NATO’s attempts to locate, identify and attack government troops, armor and artillery.The use of armed Predator drones is intended to counter that. Those drones, though, will operate only on the frontlines separating the rebels and the government forces, with the justification of protecting civilians in besieged cities like Misurata. As of late Friday, no Predators had yet attacked Libyan government forces, officials said.A senior administration official acknowledged that the fierce fighting in Misurata in particular called into question whether the NATO campaign was succeeding in protecting civilians. “There are constraints on doing that because of the stated desire to avoid civilian casualties, the technical limits of air power and even the weather,” the official said.Overall, though, the NATO campaign was never intended, by itself, to overthrow Colonel Qaddafi. The measure of success, the official added, is “not whether the rebels are marching on Tripoli.”The rebels there said they had driven Colonel Qaddafi’s men from buildings along Tripoli Avenue, a central artery, where snipers had been shooting at anyone who dared venture out. Shooting resumed later, though, near the main hospital, not far from Tripoli Avenue, according to a foreign journalist at the hospital, suggesting that whatever success the rebels had enjoyed was probably short-lived. The Libyan flag, which had been taken down the day before, was once again flying over the city’s tallest building.Libya’s deputy foreign minister, Khaled Kaim, said the army might stop fighting in Misurata because of NATO airstrikes, Reuters reported. Instead, he said, local tribes will try to negotiate with the rebels, and if that fails, the tribes will fight the rebels, the news agency reported.In Benghazi, the rebels seemed buoyed by the news from the front and from Mr. McCain’s visit. He stopped briefly at the courthouse that has been the headquarters of the uprising’s leaders. Only a few dozen Libyans were there, and they chanted pro-American and anti-Qaddafi slogans.“This,” Mr. McCain said, “was one of the most exciting and inspiring days of my life.”'"

"'11-04-24,'0','“The future here with the Knicks organization is very bright, and you don’t want to hinder that by doing too much right now on the back,” he said Saturday. “We did a phenomenal job this year so far with making the playoffs. Obviously, we wanted to have a better run in the postseason.”Stoudemire stopped short of declaring himself out of Game 4, but he gave every indication that he was leaning that way. He said his type of injury usually required three to four weeks to heal — a point he made several times.“It’s a strained back muscle,” he said. “So there’s a chance of straining it more, there’s a chance of overcompensating and having another injury. So there’s definitely some risks of playing with a strained back. And I’m not sure we want to take that risk right now when we have such a great future ahead of us.”If Stoudemire is out, the Knicks will plug in Shawne Williams, turn over the offense to Carmelo Anthony and hope for the best. They will again be without their starting point guard, Chauncey Billups, whose injured left knee has not improved.Anthony nearly saved the Knicks with a 42-point explosion in Game 2, the night Stoudemire was injured. But he was feeble in Game 3, scoring 15 points while going 4 for 16 from the field. His team-leading six assists were offset by a team-high five turnovers.The Knicks acquired Anthony for these moments, to save them from desperate situations, to score when no one else can. The Celtics’ swarming defense has made it difficult. But whatever hopes the Knicks have of extending the series now ride on Anthony.“It’s about us, man,” Anthony corrected. “I would love to sit and say, ‘It’s about me, I can do it all myself.’ But it’s about us. We got to go out there and fight.”The Celtics have higher aspirations and ample motivation to close out this series. Their core of older players — Ray Allen, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett — could use the extra rest before the second round. The Miami Heat, their probable opponent, has a 3-0 lead on the Philadelphia 76ers.“I don’t want to get swept,” Anthony said.The offense has generally sputtered since Billups went out in the final minute of Game 1. Toney Douglas was so ineffective on Friday that Coach Mike D’Antoni moved Anthony into the point-guard role in the second half.The move made sense, but it might have diminished Anthony’s scoring role.“I think that just took a lot of energy,” Anthony said.Douglas is more of a scorer than a playmaker, and this is his first playoff experience. His backcourt mate, Landry Fields, is a rookie. They have been thoroughly and predictably outplayed by the Celtics’ veteran backcourt of Rajon Rondo and Allen.Pierce has mostly outplayed Anthony as well, outscoring him slightly (25.3 points a game to 24), but with a far better shooting percentage (.528 to .359).D’Antoni said that Fields would remain in the starting lineup, despite averaging just 2 points and 25 percent shooting. Douglas has been quietly dealing with a sore right shoulder. Another starter, Ronny Turiaf, is playing on two sore knees.“It doesn’t matter what the situation is,” D’Antoni said. “We got to play with more energy, more urgency and get it done. And we can do this, we can beat these guys. We got to believe that and just try to do it Sunday.”The Knicks were always going to be underdogs against the deeper, more seasoned Celtics. But the series might have turned in the final minute of Game 1 — when Billups injured his knee — and the minutes before Game 2, when Stoudemire hurt his back in pregame warm-ups.Stoudemire had been spectacular in Game 1, with 28 points and 11 rebounds. As he prepared for Game 2, he recalled: “I was so ready to dominate. I was getting myself going.”He finished his routine the way he usually does, slapping the right side of the backboard with his left hand, then dunking across his body with his right. This time, “I felt something pull in my back,” he said.Stoudemire described the sequence a little sheepishly, realizing that one moment of pregame showmanship might have changed the series.The Knicks lost two close games in Boston despite everything. Now they are down by 3-0, possibly down two starters and perhaps hours from their season ending.Considering where the Knicks have been, Stoudemire considers this run a success.“Absolutely; there’s no doubt about it,” he said. “I think the fans of New York understand that we have a chance to do something special here now. As a team, the energy around us is a winning mentality now. That’s what you have to build on.”'"
"'11-04-24,'0','Now, a plan to turn Treasure Island into an ecometropolis for 19,000 residents with slender high-rises, sprawling parks, a 20-acre organic farm and a wind farm is inching toward approval. The planning commission voted, 4 to 3, on Thursday to certify the environmental impact report. The plan now goes to the Board of Supervisors.But questions that poked holes in previous plans persist. In particular, there is the matter of how to get thousands of people on and off the island without further snarling the congested Bay Bridge. And there is the issue of paying for the infrastructure needed to stabilize the island, which was made with fill dredged from the bay for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition.“The plans are inspirational and forward thinking, but there are some significant questions that I think are still hard to answer,” said Mr. Florin, who later worked for Lennar Urban, a developer of the current Treasure Island project, and who now works for Napa County.At the planning commission meeting, a toll, starting at $5, for anyone leaving the island in a car was presented as a way to keep traffic down. “We will be able to turn up that number until it is no longer appealing to drive off island,” said Andy Thornley, policy director for the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition.The development team — which includes Wilson Meany Sullivan, Lennar and Kenwood Investments — has proposed geotechnical fixes to firm up the island. More than a million cubic yards of fill would be crushed into the ground. The height of the island and a berm ringing the outer edge would be raised to guard against a rise in sea level.The infrastructure improvements would cost $1.5 billion, two-thirds of which would be paid for by the developers and by taxing the future residents.The final third was to be paid for with redevelopment money, but Gov. Jerry Brown intends to cut that. Now, that part would be paid for through infrastructure financing districts, a less powerful financing mechanism used to capture property taxes for street improvement and other projects.As a result, affordable housing in the project would be cut from 30 percent of the planned 8,000 units to 25 percent.Bill Sugaya, a planning commissioner, criticized that housing cut and said he had doubts about the financing tool. “We have no idea at this point how these districts are going to function and how much money they’re going to generate,” said Mr. Sugaya, who voted against the project.About 2,000 people live on Treasure Island. It has boarded-up Navy buildings, low-slung town houses, film sets and sports fields where traditional Irish games like hurling are regularly played.“At some point we just need to move forward,” said Mark Connors, who has lived on the island for six years. “Many of us have been waiting for years for the project to progress.”'"

"'11-04-24,'0','During last year’s health care reform debates, Republicans argued that the proposed reforms would result in a rationing of medical care (“death panels”) and threatened Medicare, a program they promised to protect — in spite of the fact that many Republicans opposed the enactment of Medicare and have fought to rescind or limit it for more than 45 years.As the budget proposal of Representative Paul D. Ryan makes crystal clear, however, the right wing’s idea of protecting Medicare is to shift the burden of rising health care costs “onto beneficiaries and their families,” as your editorial says.In much the same way that corporations have reneged on their promises to provide pension benefits to their employees, the Ryan plan would create a defined contribution plan in place of the existing defined benefit plan, with no provision for controlling the rise in health care costs.The inevitable consequence of the Ryan proposal would be the rationing of health care on the basis of ability to pay rather than on the basis of need. As you say, beneficiaries would be forced “to pay higher out-of-pocket costs or buy skimpier policies.”To his credit, President Obama has clarified the sharp differences between the Republican promises and the stark reality of their proposed budget reforms.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','BEIJING — A Tibet advocacy group based outside China said in a report released Friday that two Tibetans were killed Thursday night by Chinese paramilitary officers who were raiding a monastery in Sichuan Province to detain rebellious monks.The group, the International Campaign for Tibet, said security officers beat to death a man, Dongko, 60, and a woman, Sherkyi, 65, as they gathered with other people outside Kirti Monastery to try to prevent 300 monks from being taken away.Officers from the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary force usually deployed to quell riots, had put the monks in 10 trucks, the group said, citing as its source a monk from Kirti living in exile who remained in contact with the monastery. The officers then clashed with a large number of laypeople, many of them elderly, who tried to prevent the trucks from driving out the main entrance gate, the group said.The report could not be independently confirmed, though information from the International Campaign for Tibet has generally been accurate. Several human rights groups said this week that Chinese officials had begun barring foreigners from the area.One officer at a police station in the nearby county of Ganzi, known as Kardze in Tibetan, confirmed by telephone that violence had taken place in Aba (Ngaba in Tibetan). An officer answering the phone at a police station in Aba said that there was no violence and that foreign tourists could visit.'"

"'11-04-24,'0','PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (Reuters) — A second day of fighting between Thai and Cambodian troops on Saturday killed at least four soldiers, bringing the two-day death toll to 11, the worst bloodshed since the United Nations called for a cease-fire in February.Thousands of villagers have been evacuated from the disputed border area in jungles near the Ta Moan and Ta Krabey temples, about 90 miles west of the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, the site of a deadly four-day standoff in February.Lt. Gen. Thawatchai Samutsakorn of the Thai Army said one of his soldiers had been killed. A local hospital said 13 were wounded.Suos Sothea, deputy commander of Cambodia’s artillery unit in the area, said three Cambodian soldiers had been killed and 11 wounded, bringing the two-day toll of wounded on both sides to at least 43.The Cambodia Defense Ministry condemned “these repeated deliberate acts of aggression” and called on Thailand to cease “hostilities.” It accused Thailand of firing cluster munitions — weapons banned by many countries — as well as shells “loaded with poisonous gas.”The Thai foreign affairs minister, Kasit Piromya, denied those accusations as “groundless.”Sovereignty over the ancient, stone-walled Hindu temples — Preah Vihear, Ta Moan and Ta Krabey — and the jungle of the Dangrek Mountains surrounding them has been in dispute since the withdrawal of the French from Cambodia in the 1950s.Ta Moan and Ta Krabey, perched on an escarpment about seven miles apart in terrain riddled by land mines, were built in the 12th century when the Khmer empire stretched across parts of Thailand and Vietnam before shrinking to present-day Cambodia.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','“Hey, I’m not bragging about it,” Grieve said. “It’s a regret. I’m just saying times were different back then.”The paternity leave list is baseball’s latest common-sense roster rule; another new one provides for a seven-day disabled list for a player with a concussion. For several years, players have been allowed to spend three to seven days on a bereavement list for a sudden death or illness of a close relative.When Tom Wilhelmsen signed with the Milwaukee Brewers as a seventh-round pick in the 2002 draft, he expected to be in the majors within three years. With a 2.84 earned run average in 17 starts the next season, he was off to a good start.Then Wilhelmsen failed a test for marijuana. Twice. The Brewers suspended him for the 2004 season, and the next June, at 21, he quit.“I was wasting my coaches’ time,” said Wilhelmsen, a 6-foot-6 right-hander. “They could have been working with someone else who really wanted it.”For the next three years, Wilhelmsen never threw off a mound. He tended bar and stayed out late, and woke up in June 2008 with a sobering realization. His life was going nowhere. He quit smoking, and soon after, on Father’s Day, he called his dad and asked to play catch.“I wanted to get married and not come in at 4 or 5 in the morning, smelling like beer,” Wilhelmsen said. “I didn’t have a college degree. I didn’t know what else I could do.”Somehow, Wilhelmsen said, he still had life in his arm. He tried out for an independent team in Tucson and pitched 11 games in 2009, with more strikeouts than innings. The Brewers released his rights, and Wilhelmsen’s agent, Steve Canter, pitched him to Jack Zduriencik, the general manager of the Seattle Mariners.Zduriencik had been the Brewers’ scouting director when Wilhelmsen played there, and Wilhelmsen pitched well last season in 15 minor league games for Seattle. He made the Mariners’ opening day roster this spring, and has become a minor folk hero.“I get a crazy amount of texts I never got before,” Wilhelmsen said. “I’ll have my jacket on in the bullpen, so you can’t even see my number or name, and people will be yelling at me. They know who I am. It’s pretty nice.”Wilhelmsen, 27, pitched a scoreless inning in his debut in Oakland on April 3 but gave up five runs in the Mariners’ home opener five days later, including a home run by Travis Hafner that nearly reached the third deck at Safeco Field.After the homer, Wilhelmsen said he knew he had ascended to the highest level of baseball. An even more tangible sign arrived a week later. “The first paycheck,” he said.The Florida Marlins once fashioned their foul pole to look like a No. 2 pencil from Office Depot. In Houston, Chick-fil-A sponsors the Astros’ poles, with the slogan “Eat Mor Fowl.” In that, uh, tradition, the San Diego Padres unveiled their foul-pole sponsor last week.An 80-foot TaylorMade golf club is now attached to the right-field pole at Petco Park. The shaft and grip of the club run parallel to the yellow foul pole, on the fair side, with a 14-by-8-foot image of the head displayed on the outfield wall.During the Tampa Bay Rays’ first homestand of the season, Manny Ramirez told Johnny Damon that he would fly separately to Chicago for the first trip. Ramirez then left the team for two days, and Damon, who played with him in Boston, had a premonition.“I had a feeling he wasn’t coming back,” Damon said last week. “I thought maybe he’d say, ‘I want to spend time with my family; I have a 16-year-old son who’s getting big,’ or just say, ‘O.K., I don’t think I can withstand the baseball season.’ No way did I think it would be something on a drug test.”Damon now occupies the designated hitter role vacated by Ramirez, who was facing a 100-game ban for a second failed steroids test. He said he had not spoken to Ramirez since the April 8 announcement that he was retiring.“You know, I’ve never had Manny’s phone number all these years, even when we were in Boston,” Damon said. “I figure he probably never picks it up. I never saw him on the phone. He’s a little strange, but we always knew our place in here, we were best buds, we would talk about baseball. But off the field, he had his life, and my life was different.”Asked if the unseemly departure would change his perception of Ramirez, Damon said: “I wish he would have just walked away happy with it. But my thoughts will never change about him. I always thought he was a great player, great teammate. It’s just unfortunate, the tail end of his career. We don’t know everything about when he started, what he did, what he took.”And we probably never will.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','Syrian security forces fired their weapons into crowds of mourners in at least three towns on Saturday as tens of thousands of people buried protesters who were killed a day earlier in the worst bloodshed since the uprising began last month. Human rights activists and witnesses said at least 11 people were killed on Saturday.The death toll from the protests on Friday, one of the bloodiest days in the so-called Arab Spring, had risen by Saturday to 109 people, a number that activists said was likely to rise as more bodies were returned to their families. Another group said 114 people had been killed.The bloodshed on Saturday followed a pattern seen frequently in the tumult that has swept the Arab world. Funerals have often turned to demonstrations, where more have been killed by security forces bent on crushing dissent against authoritarian leaders. While Saturday’s death toll paled in comparison with the number killed on Friday, it suggested that the country might be entering a prolonged period of turmoil as protesters continue to press the greatest challenge to the Assad family’s four decades of rule.President ’s government has struggled to cope with the unrest, offering concessions that would have been startling at one time, while using violence against those who persist in demonstrations. Though the revolt has drawn large numbers into the streets since it started on March 15, it has yet to achieve the critical mass of revolutions in and . However, organizers say they believe the bloodshed may draw more people into the uprising’s fold.In a possible sign of cracks in the government’s facade, two members of ’s largely powerless Parliament resigned on Saturday. The two, Khalil al-Rifai and Nasser al-Hariri, both independent lawmakers from Dara’a, where the uprising started, told that they were resigning to protest the killing of demonstrators.Wissam Tarif, the executive director of Insan, a human rights group, said that security forces fired live ammunition at mourners after they buried their dead. The funerals soon became protests, with calls for the fall of Mr. Assad, who inherited power from his father, Hafez, in 2000. Such demands, uttered publicly, were once unheard of and serve as a marker of how outrage is overcoming fear in the repressive state.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','Mr. Deitch — trim, mild-mannered, a distance runner who favors custom-made suits from Caraceni and buffalo-horn eyeglasses he designed himself — gives little appearance of being the sort of person who might stage a dinner to celebrate the publication of a photographer’s new book and then invite the members of an all-male artist collective to entertain the 250 seated guests by clambering (wearing tuxedo jackets, stilettos and fishnets) across a wooden structure vaulting dinner table set with fine napery and silver candelabras and, once installed there, to urinate into one another’s bucket hats. Yet he is.“It was spectacular, perverse, uplifting, beautifully horrifying and deeply transgressive,” Mr. Deitch said of that particular evening, in a New Yorker profile. It was also, like many of Mr. Deitch’s seeming transgressions, professionally well judged.Among the unlikely-seeming reasons that the Museum of Contemporary Art's board bypassed more conventionally trained museum professionals for a man sometimes termed an heir to P. T. Barnum, Mr. Broad suggested, was his involvement in the Art Parade, an annual procession through downtown Manhattan in which the Dazzle Dancers and motley locals disport themselves in mainly Spandex and glitter.If, as Andy Warhol used to say, business art is the best art, the best business art in a town like this one may be the show business kind. Mr. Deitch is an avowed Warholian who considers obscure performance artists like the intellectual transvestite Vaginal Davis a celebrity, and celebrities like Kim Kardashian artists manqués.From the pool terrace of the 8,000-square-foot house that Mr. Deitch currently rents in the hills near Griffith Park (and that Cary Grant is said to have shared with Randolph Scott), a postcard panorama takes in his new city: terraced movie-star gardens, downtown skyscrapers, the far-off Pacific wreathed in haze. Above Mr. Deitch’s bed hangs an abstract Aaron Young painting that, when stared at, produces an after-image of Christ; in a nearby hall is a preparatory sketch for Warhol’s painting “Before and After.”“This is such an important, early, seminal work,” Mr. Deitch told a visitor one recent morning, referring to Warhol’s celebrated image, taken from an newspaper advertisement, depicting a woman before and after a nose job. It makes sense that, among the artworks Mr. Deitch has acquired, those he chose to show a guest depict a messianic prophet and radical metamorphosis.“We want to set the agenda” for the coming decade, Mr. Johnson, the museum co-chairman, had said, referring to the museum.That agenda became more plausible with the appointment last year of Mr. Deitch, following that of Michael Govan, the former director of the DIA Foundation, to head the Los Angeles County Museum; and of Ann Philbin, the well-regarded director of the Drawing Center, to run the Hammer Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles.The arrival of this troika, a seemingly unbeatable combination, and the decision of prominent New York galleries like Gagosian and Matthew Marks to establish outposts in Los Angeles (Mr. Marks’s gallery will open next winter), did much to bolster Mr. Broad’s grand assertion that “Los Angeles could become the contemporary art capital of the world.”If Mr. Deitch shares Mr. Broad’s ambitions, it’s in a played-down manner that can seem oddly like an asset in a town where hyperbole is the norm and personalities are often as bloated as floats in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. (See: Weintraub, Jerry.)“We’re acculturated to the fusion of media now,” and equally to the decades-old institutionalization of high/low aesthetics, Mr. Deitch said one day last week over lunch at the down-home Urth Caffe, his hangout, where patrons bus their own trays. “Art, film, fashion, music are all going on and interacting simultaneously,” he added. “And L.A. is very receptive to that fusion.”Critics of Mr. Deitch, and there are many, hold their noses at his apparent indifference to art-world hierarchies, equating his appointment with the death of civilization.“The supreme opportunist,” Jed Perl, art critic for The New Republic, wrote of him in a critique that stopped just short of accusing Mr. Deitch of running a shop for art-trend knickknacks.Some, like the blogger who attributed a series of moronic remarks to Mr. Deitch on Twitter, under the handle @FakeDeitch, see him as a carpetbagger. Some, on the evidence of stealth videos that made the rounds for a time, view him as an art-world Führer, a heavy-handed censor who, shortly before “Art in the Streets” was set to open, ordered a graffiti mural by the Italian artist Blu painted over because its content, rows of coffins draped in dollar bills, was too political.“That killed me,” said Mr. Deitch of the controversy surrounding his decision to blot out Blu’s mural, a move he explained was made necessary by the mural’s position facing a memorial commemorating Japanese-American soldiers who fell during World War II.None of this mattered to the crowds lined up outside the Geffen Center in Little Tokyo last Saturday, not the censorship or the future of museums or the tendency among many in the art world to scour each minor occurrence for meaning, the way ancient divines did the entrails of birds.They had come to see Neck Face, the graffiti artist whose installation — a menacing alley replete with flashing lights and the artist as a filth-covered hobo — was inspired, he explained, not by such obvious forerunners as the artist Mike Kelley but by his family’s unofficial trade constructing haunted houses. They’d come for the gloomy, wall-covering murals of inverted dead mammals by the Belgian graffiti artist ROA and the candy-colored cartoon ones by graffiti elders like Kenny Scharf and Futura 2000, né Leonard McGurr.They’d come for the gorgeously calligraphic markings by Retna; the demented funhouse installations by the Brazilian twins Os Gêmeos; the wall of faux naïve placards by the late Margaret Kilgallen; the “period” spaces recreated or taken intact from such shrines to the graffiti movement as the Fun Gallery or the black-lighted TriBeCa loft long inhabited by the graffiti legend Rammellzee.This list barely begins to cover the extent of an outlaw artistic movement in “Art in the Streets,” which tracks the great graffiti dispersion from styles first created in New York by Lee Quinones, Dondi, Futura 2000 and others and that soon enough made it to Philadelphia, Chicago, the West Coast and the world.The Los Angeles Times termed “Art in the Streets” a “bombastic, near-overwhelming cavalcade of eye-candy,” a crowd-teasing pull-quote if ever there was one. And while it’s too early to know how the exhibition will fare with critics, there is little reason to doubt Mr. Broad’s assertion that it will likely pull the crowds in and engage a new public, most particularly “audiences that would not otherwise go to museums.”But the greater challenge faced by Mr. Deitch and others in the field is not luring new audiences accustomed to consuming media in blended form as much as it is attracting those who consume most media on hand-held tablets back into a brick-and-mortar temples to art. Will he be able to draw Angelenos off the freeways and the often gritty streets with even grittier and dystopic-Disney versions of American lives as conjured in a raunchy, immersive installation titled “Street”?Will the decision to make his directorial mark with an ephemeral and often outlaw art form pay off for Mr. Deitch and the museum? Is “Art in the Streets” his signature gesture, his tag?“We have to be very careful here to keep things rigorous and not pollute” the underlying mission of institutions like MOCA to uphold the highest standards of culture, Mr. Deitch said. “But at the same time, the art world has a tendency to academicism and aridity. I’m very interested in seeing that art remains connected to emotion. I’m a very optimistic person and it’s important to me that the museum conveys that optimism to people, that the art we show stays connected to life.”'"

"'11-04-24,'0','AS the tranquil tones of church bells and choirs usher in another Easter Sunday, you may hear stirrings of controversy beneath those sounds — set to the pounding of a Lady Gaga tune.It’s no accident that Lady Gaga decided to release the video for her provocative single, “Judas,” this Easter. From wearing see-through nun habits to suggestively swallowing a rosary, the pop star, who was raised a Catholic, has consistently prodded her faith’s strict sexual conventions.But if Lady Gaga has managed to offend some Catholics, her progressiveness, specifically her support for gay equality, reflects a genuine cultural moment. A recent study indicates that today’s Catholics are the most progressive Christians in the country regarding gay equality — and more open than Americans in general.Last month, the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit group, reported that 74 percent of American Catholics surveyed supported the rights of same-sex couples to marry or form civil unions (43 percent and 31 percent, respectively). The telephone survey asked more than 3,000 adults to choose among three options: whether gay couples should be allowed to marry, should be allowed to form civil unions or should receive no legal recognition. By comparison, 16 percent of white evangelical Christians approved of same-sex marriages; 24 percent approved of civil unions. Among the general public, those rates climb to 37 and 27 percent, respectively — still lower than among Catholics.Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an independent group that has worked on gay Catholic issues since 1977, said he had seen Catholics open up in recent years. His group maintains a list of “gay-friendly parishes and faith communities” around the country, which has grown to more than 200 from about 20 since 1997.Church traditions in social-justice advocacy play a strong role, he said. “These people aren’t picking and choosing their Catholicism; their Catholicism has motivated them.”'"
"'11-04-24,'0','A stylish Swedish oasis in the city at $350 and up.Last June, Stockholm was energized by the Swedish crown princess’s glamorous wedding extravaganza. But over the last few years, this style-setting city has also seen the opening of a world-class photography museum, a large number of design shops and clothing boutiques, a Michelin-starred restaurant and some gorgeous hotels. Among them is the 79-room Hotel Skeppsholmen, a casually luxurious boutique hotel opened in late 2009, housed in two historical buildings that date from 1699.A 10-minute walk from the bustle of central Stockholm. It is on the quiet, leafy island of Skeppsholmen, steps from the Museum of Modern Art and the Swedish Museum of Architecture.At check-in, my husband and I were upgraded, unprompted, from a large sea-view room to a suite. All rooms have blond wood floors and large windows with wooden shutters, flat-screen TVs and mini-bars stocked with Swedish treats, plus playful items like flexible black vinyl bedside lamps. The sprawling suite, a spare, harmonious blend of modern and traditional Scandinavian design, also had a fluffy king bed, an office nook and a spacious living room.A frosted-glass sliding door separated the living room from the gray-tiled bathroom. All bathrooms have overhead rain showers, but the suite has a freestanding tub as well. There were some delightfully magical elements: after a steamy shower, the center portion of the large bathroom mirror remained mysteriously fog-free. And the physics-defying Boffi sink is inverted — water poured onto a convex gray stone rather than a concave basin.Wi-Fi is free and reliable, and the bathroom is stocked with subtly fragrant bath products from the cult Swedish brand Byredo. There is a tiny workout room for those who absolutely must lift some weights or pound a treadmill (though a jog around the peaceful island with stunning views of the city over the water would undoubtedly be more enjoyable). Service at the hotel’s restaurant was a tad slow, but the establishment’s popularity among fashionable, discerning Stockholmers is understandable: the two traditional Swedish dishes we tried, cured salmon and meatballs, were excellent.A buffet breakfast is included in the rate; room-service delivery incurred a 60-kronor surcharge ($9.75 at 6 kronor to the dollar). Our breakfast was delivered promptly and error-free, even with an off-menu special request. Baked goods are a forte of Swedes, and the assortment of breads didn’t disappoint. (The moist cinnamon buns were particularly notable.)Combine a friendly staff and a serene location within striking distance of the city’s action, and the Hotel Skeppsholmen hits every mark. With the Byredo candle burning in the lobby and dramatic hallway light installations, the whole place oozes chic; even the elevator is inexplicably cool. Doubles start at 2,195 Swedish kronor (about $350), with tax.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','When the video appeared in late February, evangelical leaders began castigating Bell. Joshua Harris, a pastor and author best known for inspiring evangelical college students to abandon dating in favor of “biblical courtship,” declared on Twitter: “There’s nothing loving about preaching a false gospel. This breaks my heart. Praying for Rob Bell.” The Baptist pastor John Piper offered a pithier tweet: “Farewell Rob Bell.”So what does the actual book say? First, Bell challenges the notion that heaven is just an ethereal spiritual state we anticipate during our earthly lives. Heaven, Bell argues, is both the “age to come,” when God will dwell with people and injustice will be eradicated, and our present experience of peace and love: “There’s heaven now, somewhere else. There’s heaven here, sometime else. And then there’s Jesus’ invitation to heaven here and now, in this moment in this place.” Bell urges readers to cultivate “the life of heaven now,” pursuing “sacred tasks” like eradicating nuclear weapons and ending sex trafficking.As for the future heaven, Bell does indeed question the teaching that only a select few will get there. He imagines a woman sitting in church crying because she realizes that “if what the pastor is saying about heaven is true, she will be separated from her mother and father, brothers and sisters . . . forever, with no chance of any reunion, ever.” Against that vision, Bell suggests “an exclusivity on the other side of inclusivity.”“Jesus is the way,” he writes, but “the all-embracing, saving love of this particular Jesus the Christ will of course include all sorts of unexpected people from across the cultural spectrum. . . . What Jesus does is declare that he, and he alone, is saving everybody. And then he leaves the door way, way open. Creating all sorts of possibilities. He is as narrow as himself and as wide as the universe.”To an atheist or a Wiccan or a Jew, that formulation may seem condescending. Who wants to be saved by a deity he doesn’t believe in? For some conservative evangelicals, Bell’s argument offends for a different reason: it seems to contradict centuries of Christian teaching, along with biblical passages like “Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God” (John 3:18).But the brisk sales of Bell’s book suggest that many Christian readers, even some evangelicals, find his formulation worth pondering. “Exclusivity on the other side of inclusivity” offers them a way to navigate tensions within the Bible, which also includes passages indicating that one can at least hope for the salvation of all. (“And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself,” Jesus says in John 12.) And it offers them a way to hold on to Jesus’ particularity in a pluralist world, a world in which wondering about the eternal fate of, say, a Hindu is not an abstract question but a question about your college roommate.For all the controversy, this book’s argument has been building for a long time. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many evangelicals rejected universalism, even as it began to gain traction among liberal Protestants. Yet for the last half-century, universalism has been subtly reshaping North American evangelicalism, to the alarm of many evangelical leaders. As early as 1965, the theologian J. I. Packer warned that many evangelicals had “slipped into the practice of living and behaving as if universalism were true,” even though those same functional universalists would never declare a doctrinal commitment to universal salvation. Two decades later, the sociologist James Davison Hunter detected a creeping liberalism in evangelical thought. “There is a pervasive uneasiness both about the nature of hell and about who is relegated to it,” he wrote. “It is an uneasiness which may portend a greater cultural accommodation.” “Love Wins” can be read as a fulfillment of Hunter’s observation.Historians of heaven will tell you that we tend to sort out our most urgent social concerns in part through our visions of the afterlife. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps described heaven for a generation saturated in Victorian idolization of the family and devastated by the carnage of the Civil War: for Phelps and her readers, it was impossible to imagine an afterlife in which intimate family reunion was not central. So, too, Rob Bell is articulating the concerns of a generation of Christians schooled in toleration, whose neighbors and coworkers and siblings are Muslim or Buddhist or agnostic, a generation whose pluralist social commitments are at odds with theological commitments to limited salvation. Bell speaks for those Christians who take the Bible seriously but can’t imagine their secular friends aren’t going to heaven, too. He speaks for that woman in the pew who can’t bear the thought of spending eternity apart from her atheist brother. The tweeting gatekeepers of conservative evangelicalism may also share these concerns, but for them, the solution is to convert the unbelieving neighbor. For them, confident optimism that Jesus simply saves everyone is evasive at best, and heretical at worst. But, then, the gatekeepers called Phelps an infidel, too.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','MANHATTAN has the Chrysler Building and the General Motors Building, and now, in a somewhat different vein, comes Mercedes House, an 850-unit apartment complex at 53rd Street and 11th Avenue in Clinton.The 30-story building, being developed by Two Trees Management, will have a Mercedes showroom and service center on the bottom floors, with auto sales beginning in May.That could help the building stand out in a crowded field of new luxury apartment buildings on the West Side, which is partly why David C. Walentas, the founder Two Trees, scrapped his original name, Clinton Park, a reference to the green space across the street. “People are going to call it Mercedes House no matter what we call it,” Mr. Walentas said on a recent tour of the building, “so why not just call it that?”The $550 million rental and condominium project is going up in two phases.The first, to be completed in May, includes 250 rental units, ranging from 460-square-foot studios to 1,000-square-foot two-bedrooms. All units will have oak floors, 10-foot ceilings, and washers and dryers, and many will have terraces, owing to the large number of setbacks, which are so pronounced that much of the building’s roof line resembles a staircase.That staircase appears to zig and zag as it climbs. Enrique Norten, the principal of TEN Arquitectos and the designer, designed the building so it looks like a “Z” in reverse if viewed from above.'"
"'11-04-24,'0','In his presentation, Wakefield sounded impatient but righteous. He used enough scientific terms — “ataxic,” “histopathological review” and “vaccine excipients” — that those parents who did not feel cowed might have been flattered by his assumption of their scientific fluency. He also tried to defend himself against a few of the charges laid out in The British Medical Journal — offering defenses that did not hold up before the journal’s panel of editors but were perhaps enough to assure an audience of his fans that he did, in fact, have defenses. Some part of Wakefield’s cult status is surely because of his personal charisma, and he spoke with great rhetorical flair. He took off his glasses and put them back on like a gifted actor maximizing a prop. “What happens to me doesn’t matter,” he said at one point. “What happens to these children does matter.”After the talk, a line of visitors snaked down the length of the lobby, his followers waiting to have Wakefield sign a book he wrote about his experience and convictions, “Callous Disregard.” “All right, love?” he said, handing the book back to one mother. “Of course,” he said when asked for a photo. A pregnant woman in the lobby told me she was there trying to educate herself. Another woman, with tears in her eyes, blamed herself for not working harder to obtain a separate measles vaccine for her possibly autistic child.Michelle Guppy, the coordinator of the Houston Autism Disability Network and the organizer of the Tomball event, said she believed her own autistic son benefited greatly from one aspect of Wakefield’s work: his conviction that untreated gastrointestinal problems could be behind some of autism’s symptoms. It was Guppy, it turned out, who thought to hire the armed guards “to make the statement,” she said, “that this is neutral ground, and it’s going to be civil.” Guppy, a mother of two who was elegantly dressed for the occasion, made no pretense of neutrality herself. She narrowed her eyes when she learned that a writer from The New York Times was there to write about Wakefield.“Be nice to him,” she said, “or we will hurt you.”During a three-hour car ride from Tomball back to Austin, where he lives, Wakefield pointed out the curiosities of the area: a roadrunner, burning bales of hay. He was a gracious host in his adopted state, which he finds far more hospitable than the country he left. Sitting beside him was a bottle of Redline, an energy drink that promises a seven-hour boost. “It’s great,” he told me. “There’s no crash.”Wakefield moved to Austin in 2004, a few years after he was asked to leave the Royal Free Hospital, reportedly because he didn’t fulfill a request that he duplicate the findings in the Lancet paper. Supporters in Austin reached out to Wakefield after he gave a talk there, which led to his helping to found Thoughtful House Center for Children, a treatment and research center for kids with autism.But after the General Medical Council found in January 2010 that Wakefield had committed ethical violations — subjecting developmentally disabled children to unnecessary invasive procedures, mishandling funds and failing to disclose conflicts of interest, to name a few — Wakefield resigned from Thoughtful House. The walls of his professional world have continued to close in. He no longer speaks at the popular Autism Research Institute conference, where he has prominently held court in the past. And to that segment of the American audience that may have been unfamiliar with his work until recently, he has been introduced primarily as a villain. When he was interviewed on CNN and invoked “Callous Disregard,” Anderson Cooper cut him off: “But sir, if you’re lying, then your book is also a lie.”At the start of the drive, Wakefield spoke with the calmness of the self-certain, ready with a counterargument for every concern. How does he respond to the decline in vaccination rates that some attribute to his theory? If only officials had offered a single measles vaccine, he said, there would have been no uptick in unvaccinated children. (Immunologists argue that spacing out vaccines increases the likelihood that children will not receive all of the vaccines and that they could contract a serious illness during the interim.) Why was there no mention in his Lancet paper that initial pathology reports found little indication of bowel disease in the cases Wakefield wrote about? “You have incredibly limited space,” he told me in a subsequent conversation. As for the accusation that he received financing for the paper from lawyers intending to sue vaccine manufacturers, he insisted that the money was for a separate study. And why did the lawyer behind the litigation essentially say otherwise on tape? “He was confused,” Wakefield explained. His faith in his theory also remains intact, which he made clear when I asked him, in a separate interview, if he still believed M.M.R. caused the autism in the children in the Lancet paper. “Is that a serious question?” he said. “Yes, I do still think M.M.R. was causing it.”For Wakefield, the attacks have become a kind of affirmation. The more he must defend his research, the more important he seems to consider it — so important that powerful forces have conspired and aligned against him. He said he believes that “they” — public-health officials, pharmaceutical companies — pay bloggers to plant vicious comments about him on the Web. “Because it’s always the same,” he says. “Discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield, discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield.” He also “wouldn’t be surprised” if public-health officials were inflating the number of measles mortalities, just as he thinks they inflate the risks of the flu to increase uptake of that vaccine. Having been rejected by mainstream medicine, Wakefield, the son of well-regarded doctors in Britain, has apparently rejected the integrity of mainstream medicine in return.Wakefield never seemed too perturbed by my questions; if he felt any irritation, he took it out on his GPS, which he seemed to think was out to get him, just like his critics. “There’s no left turn here, you idiot,” he said to the disembodied voice. “Turn right? Why? What’s the point?”Finally Wakefield allowed for an error in his judgment. “I think the press conference is something we could have done without,” he acknowledged. It is no small concession. The media response might not have been so inflammatory; vaccination rates might not have taken such a hit; and on a personal level, Wakefield might have at least been spared accusations of provoking hysteria with calculated hype.But, Wakefield clarified, he regretted the press conference only “because it inflamed the public officials.” In the long term, he said, it did not matter; eventually, they — the establishment — would have come after him anyway.“To our community, Andrew Wakefield is Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ rolled up into one,” says J. B. Handley, co-founder of Generation Rescue, a group that disputes vaccine safety. “He’s a symbol of how all of us feel.”Since losing his medical license, Wakefield has depended on his followers for financing and for the emotional scaffolding that allows him to believe himself a truth-teller when the majority of his peers consider him a menace to medicine. The fact that his fans have stood by him through his denunciation may seem surprising, but they may find it easier to ignore his critics than to reject their faith in him. After all, his is a rare voice of certainty in the face of a disease that is, at its core, mysterious.The diagnosis of autism can be devastating. In some cases, a child regresses between 12 and 24 months, baffling parents who do not recognize the child who has replaced the one they knew and has no words to explain. In other instances, they watch their friends’ children sit up, babble and reach out for hugs, when their own do not. Unable to communicate, a small percentage of autistic children bite their own arms raw or bang their heads against the wall, for reasons poorly understood.“We still do not have an explanation for the vast majority of autism cases,” says Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, who is in charge of coordinating the $120 million worth of research being conducted on autism there. With regard to autism, Insel calls himself a “prophet of humility.”Most researchers say that there is a rise in the number of children who are landing somewhere on the autism spectrum and that only some portion of that increase can be explained by raised awareness of the disorder. In this decade alone, Insel says, diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (which includes mild cases) have jumped to 1 in 110, from 1 in 150; in boys, it’s now 1 in 70. He worries that the rate is accelerating. “I would say I am losing sleep over this,” Insel says.What has become increasingly clear to Insel is that something is to blame. Some environmental factor is, or many environmental factors are, interacting with certain gene types, yielding who knows how many different pathways to the same disease. And although many parents think they know with instinctual certainty what that factor was in their own child, researchers “haven’t found anything that looks like a smoking gun,” Insel says. To him, the M.M.R. vaccine, so aggressively studied since the media splash following Wakefield’s 1998 paper, is one of the few factors that can be ruled out. But could it be aspartame? UV rays? Elmo? No one knows.“With autism, people have done this all along — grasped onto various explanations and reached premature closure on each of them,” Insel says of Wakefield’s work. “What I take from the Wakefield story is that everyone is desperate to find answers to what we see as an urgent problem. And if I’m really brutally honest about this, we still don’t have an answer.”To parents who have run up against unsatisfying answers from the scientific community, Wakefield offers a combination of celebrity and empathy that leaves strong impressions. Michelle Guppy, the mother from the Houston Autism Disability Network who brought Wakefield to speak in Tomball, subsequently spoke to me on the phone about the experience she had at Thoughtful House. She had taken her adolescent son there after a series of mainstream doctors failed to help his constant diarrhea, which required her to change his diaper as many as 10 times a day.“I mean, I remember, Dr. Wakefield was there,” Guppy said, her voice starting to quaver. “And you know, it was just the validation. I don’t care if my son was overtreated or cured — just the validation that we as parents who knew something was wrong got an answer. Just the fact that someone listened and someone tried to do something — someone said, ‘Yeah, this is not just autism; your son has a real medical issue that we can treat.’ I think that validation is all that parents want — just that someone is taking the symptoms we report and looking at them to see what can we do about it.”At Thoughtful House, her son was given an endoscopy, which is considered an invasive procedure. Following the diagnosis, a doctor there (who has also left Thoughtful House and has also come under a cloud of criticism) put him on anti-inflammatories and a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Perhaps her son’s system was maturing anyway, but Guppy credits the treatment, and Wakefield, for vastly improving both their lives.Wakefield’s big theory — that M.M.R. causes a bowel disorder, which he calls autistic enterocolitis, that then causes autism — has been dismissed by mainstream medicine. And a position paper published last year in Pediatrics also stated that available research did not support the use of casein- and gluten-free diets in the general autistic population (the diets, adapted in extreme measures, can cause health complications of their own). But Timothy Buie, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Harvard Medical School and one of the paper’s authors, felt that the press ignored other key implications in their findings: that there might be a subsection of autistic patients who would benefit from dietary interventions and that the role of the immune system in gastrointestinal dysfunction in children with autism “warrants additional investigation.”Buie makes it clear that he is no fan of Wakefield’s; but he does say that Wakefield was a kind of pioneer in disseminating certain useful ideas about autism. Wakefield’s least controversial conviction may be the belief that some symptoms of autism — repetitive body movements, leaning over furniture, self-injury — might be symptoms of gastrointestinal distress in an autistic population unable to verbalize that discomfort.Pat Levitt, a neuroscientist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and an autism researcher in whom the National Institute of Mental Health has invested heavily, is also now interested in the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with autism. He has found a gene variant that is more prevalent in children who have autism and gastrointestinal problems than it is in children who have autism but no digestive irregularities. Levitt does not believe that a faulty gut is the cause of autism, as Wakefield theorized, but that the two problems might develop, in some subset of people on the autism spectrum, in tandem, each a result of a flawed interaction of genes and environment. He does not believe — as some of Wakefield’s followers hoped — that by treating an intestinal malady, he will cure the underlying autism. “But is it the case that if you have GI problems, that can exacerbate your child’s behavioral issues?” says Levitt, whose recent work has not yet been replicated. “The answer is absolutely yes.”Levitt and Buie said they believed that for years parents’ concerns about their autistic children’s gastrointestinal problems were too often dismissed, partly because doctors associated those concerns with quackery and vaccine fears and the false hope that a diet could cure the autism itself. When Levitt gives talks, he sometimes puts a picture of Wakefield up on the screen. “Bad science,” he then says, “set us back 10 years.”The slow course of gastrointestinal research in autism — still a controversial subject — has fewer public-health implications than dropping vaccine rates do, but it is an interesting footnote, one of the odd legacies of Wakefield’s work. He was adored by parents because he validated some of their most agonizing concerns when they felt few others would. But he was also one main reason that those medical symptoms were being dismissed in the first place.If Andrew Wakefield’s followers see him as a martyr, then his chief persecutor, in their eyes, is a British journalist named Brian Deer. Wakefield calls Deer a “hit man,” though Deer claims no such agenda (he has been as critical of the medical establishment that allowed Wakefield to get as far as he did as he has been of Wakefield himself). Were it not for Deer, Wakefield might have been nothing more than a scientist who was proved wrong. But Deer, who has been investigating Wakefield since 2004 and who this April won the Specialist Journalist of the Year award from England’s Society of Editors for his work, has presented a far more damning view of Wakefield to the world.In his British Medical Journal series, Deer made the case that Wakefield was not just wrong but also unethical. He said that the doctor misrepresented at least one aspect of the medical condition of every child he wrote about in the study. Wakefield contests virtually every one of those charges, and it would take a book to encompass Deer’s allegations, Wakefield’s parries and Deer’s counterproof. But one charge that Deer argues convincingly is that several children in the Lancet paper had records showing concerns about developmental delays before getting the M.M.R. shot. Deer points out that another child, whose record was more ambiguous, was seen by a doctor before receiving the M.M.R. vaccine, because his mother was concerned that his hearing was imperfect, “which might sound like a hallmark presentation of classical autism,” Deer wrote.In Wakefield’s presentation at the church in Tomball, he seized upon this detail as evidence of Deer’s overreaching. He pointed out that Deer neglected to mention that the mother also reported to that same doctor that there was discharge from the child’s ear. “What does that suggest to you?” he asked the audience. Some parents called out with confidence, “Ear infection,” which — those parents were very likely to know — can impair a child’s hearing. With that one example, Wakefield did what he does so skillfully: empowered parents as medical experts as he tried to undermine the credibility of his accusers, just enough to convince those who already support him that they are justified in doing so.You could read Deer’s collected body of research on Wakefield and come away with the conviction that Wakefield was an underhanded profiteer who exploited parents and abused their disabled children with invasive tests for the sole purpose of capitalizing on parents’ fears about the M.M.R. vaccine. (He applied, for example, for a patent for a diagnostic kit that could test for measles virus in the intestines.) But Deer does not think Wakefield was solely motivated by profit. He compares him to the kind of religious leader who is a true believer but relies on the occasional use of smoke and mirrors to goose the faith of his followers. “He believed it was true,” Deer says of Wakefield’s theory of M.M.R., but he was also willing to stretch the truth to get more financing for more research. Deer theorizes that Wakefield’s maneuverings were all rationalized by his conviction that he was right: “He would prove it next time.”Wakefield now lives in a high-end Austin neighborhood, a private enclave where most homes, including his, enjoy generous acreage and bucolic views of the hills. “You can almost believe you’re in Tuscany,” he says of the view from his back deck.A large dog roamed about the house; a very tall son watched an English soccer match; and Wakefield, while making coffee and emptying the dishwasher, continued to bat away charges. He claimed, for example, that a “safer” measles vaccine for which he filed a patent was not, in fact, a rival to M.M.R., which would have been a clear conflict of interest; it was instead an immune-boosting vaccine for those with compromised immune systems, an unfortunate semantic mix-up. (“He is very good at what I call whack-a-mole arguments,” says Seth Mnookin, author of “The Panic Virus,” a history of the controversy over autism and vaccines.)Wakefield is a persuasive speaker, even when the listener knows better. As we talked, I couldn’t help thinking of a clip of Wakefield I saw on YouTube. The video showed him at a conference in 1999, telling the audience about the time he lined up kids to give blood samples at the birthday party of one of his children: he needed a control group of children who did not have autism, and this was convenient. “Two children fainted,” he said. “Another threw up over his mother.” For their service, they were rewarded with £5. “People said to me, ‘Andrew, you know you can’t do this to people; children won’t come back,’ ” he recounted. “I said, ‘You’re wrong — listen, we live in a free-market economy; next year, they’ll want £10.’ ”Clearly, drawing blood in that setting was part of no medical protocol that an ethics committee would ever approve. The General Medical Council, in its ruling against Wakefield, said that by engaging in this behavior, he displayed conduct that “fell seriously short of the standards expected of a doctor and was a breach of the trust that the public is entitled to have in members of the medical profession” and deemed the episode “serious professional misconduct.”Wakefield was either naïve or arrogant to think that he could joke on camera about the lengths to which he had gone in the pursuit of proving his theories right. But what is also striking about that video is the sound of the audience laughing. He had won over a room full of parents, who were caught up in the charm of a maverick. It was hard to imagine Wakefield making such a joke now; he has not retreated from his position, but he has shifted his sense of identity from that of a renegade to that of a martyr. He often says that he has stuck by a theory that “has cost me my job, my livelihood and my country.” The more he has sacrificed, the more he must believe in his theory — or else what was it all for? A quote from Peter Medawar, a British scientist who wrote a famous critique of a book of specious ideas about evolution, comes to mind: “Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.”Wakefield continues to work with a sense of mission and an entrepreneurial savvy. Since leaving Thoughtful House, he has been working on a book about parents who have been falsely accused of Munchausen syndrome by proxy: the world of false accusations, of unheard parents in pain — familiar territory, all of it. He is also trying to raise money for a center for autistic adults. It is a shrewd business move with explosive potential for growth: 80 percent of the autistic population in the U.S. is currently under 18.That morning in Austin, Wakefield was on his way to yet another contentious interview in New York, this one with George Stephanopoulos. His son, who drove Wakefield and me to the airport, had no plans to follow in the footsteps of his parents and his paternal grandparents, all of whom were doctors: he was majoring in public relations and marketing instead. Perhaps his father’s experience had taught him something about the perils of science and about the power of messaging.It seems very unlikely that any study, no matter how carefully conducted, will assure Wakefield of the safety of M.M.R. at this point: numbers can lie, or be manipulated, and even paranoids have enemies. Didn’t they laugh at the researcher who said bacteria caused ulcers? Doesn’t he owe it to the children to continue on?Before leaving for the airport with Wakefield and his son, I took in the view from the deck. The hills looked lofty, peaceful, a little bit blurred in the distance — you could believe, as Wakefield had promised, you were in Tuscany. With a little effort, you can believe almost anything.'"

"'11-04-25,'0','Over the years, the headlines, court cases and wrecked careers put generations of officers on notice about the professional risks involved in fixing a ticket. Yet the practice persisted. Now it has become the focus of a major multiprecinct investigation, the largest focused on ticket-fixing since the 1950s.Some are wondering what took so long. Hundreds of officers could be disciplined by the time a grand jury in the Bronx finishes its work, including roughly two dozen officers who could face criminal charges, officials and others briefed on the case have said. The inquiry began when the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau, in an unrelated investigation, taped an officer in mid-2009 trying to have a ticket fixed.The scheme centers on union delegates and trustees. Officers wanting to make a ticket disappear — or following orders to do so — would seek out union officials who seemed plugged into a network for doing it safely.On Friday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the ticket-fixing should have been stopped sooner. “There seems to be a lot of evidence that there was a practice that should not have taken place,” he said during his weekly radio program on WOR.The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, citing the grand jury’s work, said through a spokesman that he had no comment.“Whenever an allegation of ticket-fixing came to the commissioner’s attention, it was pursued by I.A.B.,” said the spokesman, Paul J. Browne, referring to the Internal Affairs Bureau. “And no, he never fixed a ticket or was party to fixing one.”Over the years, discipline meted out in ticket cases has been focused mostly on officers characterized by superiors as rogues, including some who had been caught accepting a bribe. When officers have been found to have fixed tickets, the department has come down hard, handling it as a career-ending offense and holding internal trials, but leaving it there.Many active and retired officers said they could not recall any departmentwide measures to curb the practice. Several current and former prosecutors said it was extremely rare for Internal Affairs to bring ticket-fixing cases to a district attorney’s office. One former assistant district attorney who supervised and prosecuted police corruption cases said he could recall only one such instance; several others could recall none.“This stuff has been happening since the beginning of time,” the former prosecutor said, “and it’d be like picking off ducks in a barrel. Anytime anyone wanted to, they could make a big case, so they just haven’t wanted to.”While ticket-fixing was a regular practice, many rank-and-file officers dreaded receiving such requests. “Most guys spend their whole career hoping this does not blow their way,” said one officer who insisted on anonymity, referring to ticket requests.A law enforcement official, in defending the Police Department, noted that it was the department that brought the case to the office of the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson.Rae Downes Koshetz, a former Police Department deputy commissioner of trials who presided over administrative hearings of officers, said a handful of such cases came her way. “Anytime one of those cases came before me, it was a firing offense to fix a ticket,” she said. “It’s corruption. Sometimes it involves bribery, lying, and the department is supposed to have a zero-tolerance policy for lying.”She added: “I was there for 14 years. We weren’t clogged with ticket-fixing cases.”In one case, upheld by an appellate court, Officer Jeffrey Cohen was found to have tried to harass and intimidate a fellow officer into making false statements about the issuing of a ticket. Taped conversations showed how the motorist’s testimony was coached. Officer Cohen was fired from the department.In another case, from 1997, an officer was fired for taking $200 to rip up a speeding ticket for a friend, Ms. Koshetz said.Union officials, fighting back against an inquiry that has yet to be officially acknowledged by the Bronx district attorney’s office, which is running it, are defending themselves by hinting that high-ranking officials were involved in the process.After the ticket inquiry began, Mr. Kelly moved last August to implement a nonfixable system for tickets — some 60 years after Governor Dewey first tried it. Mr. Kelly ushered in a new computerized system to provide for an electronic record of every ticket, in the hope that such a system would prove less corruptible.Ms. Koshetz said the department deserved credit for implementing the system, known as the Electronic Summons Tracking System and described in a departmental memo as a way to “increase administrative efficiency and ensure accountability” over summonses.“It seems that the department has dealt with it by trying to make it difficult, by having a computer system and giving them ticket books where the summonses are consecutively numbered,” Ms. Koshetz said.Some officers say it was once a cinch to fix tickets: An officer could rip up all the copies headed for traffic court, or to commanders. Sometimes the paperwork was retrieved from a box behind the precinct desk that is emptied once each shift. But the officer could also go to court and feign memory loss or call in sick on consecutive court dates.The officer who spoke anonymously said some in the department became cynical about traffic court because of its unpredictable, freewheeling atmosphere. Harold Dee, a lawyer, said he had heard some troubling requests when he was a traffic court judge in the Bronx and Harlem before retiring from the bench nearly two decades ago.“Occasionally a cop would come to me and say, ‘Oh, Judge Dee, I wrote this but I found out the person is family. I’m sorry I wrote it, so I’m going to say that my radar was not properly checked out,’ ” he said. “I’d listen and I’d never know if it was some sort of shoofly or somebody trying to get me indicted. I’d say, ‘Officer, just present your case, and if it’s not sufficient, I’ll dismiss the charges.’ ”Any given ticket fix might involve three or four officers, each with varying motives and moral and legal distinctions, according to those who have done it. One officer might have called in a request to help a friend; a second might have relayed that request to a third in the precinct where the ticket was issued.And a fourth might fix it for no other reason except that, as Ms. Koshetz put it, “there are very powerful incentives within the Police Department to get along and go along.”'"
"'11-04-25,'0','Indian television ran nonstop news coverage of his death on Sunday, and officials expressed sadness. “Sri Sathya Sai Baba was a spiritual leader who inspired millions to lead a moral and meaningful life, even as they followed the religion of their choice,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement.The state of Andhra Pradesh, where Puttaparthi is located, declared four days of mourning. Its top official, Chief Minister Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy, called Sai Baba “a symbol of love, affection and passion.”Born Sathyanarayana Raju on Nov. 23, 1926, Sathya Sai Baba declared in 1940 that he was an avatar, or reincarnation, of another Hindu holy man, the Sai Baba of Shirdi, a town in Maharashtra State, who died in 1918.As the young guru attracted followers, his hometown, Puttaparthi, grew from a sleepy village into a vibrant town with a sprawling ashram, built in 1950, as well as a large hospital, a university and schools run by his Sathya Sai Central Trust, set up in 1972 with donations.The trust, estimated to be worth at least $8.9 billion, also established spiritual centers in the Indian cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai. In addition, it built another hospital in Bangalore, India, where Sai Baba had a summer home, and financed water supply projects in several of the country’s southern states.Though no successor has been named to run the trust, “there is or will be no vacuum,” according to a statement released after the guru was hospitalized.In recent years health problems had forced Sai Baba to cut down on public appearances. In 2005, he began using a wheelchair, and a year later he fractured his hip when a student fell from a stool onto him. He had survived a stroke and a series of heart attacks in 1963.Sai Baba was also mired in controversy. A 2004 BBC television program featured interviews with American men who said he had fondled them and exposed himself to them while asserting that it was part of a healing ritual. Though he denied the accusations and was never charged with any crime, the reports led some followers to break with him.The ashram also said Sai Baba had survived an attempt on his life in 1993. It said that six devotees, including the guru’s personal assistant, were killed in his bedroom and that they had tried to attack him, although the details of the case remain a mystery.Sai Baba never married and had no children.'"
"'11-04-25,'0','Packed inside St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Sunday, nearly 3,000 people from around the world gathered to hear Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan deliver his Easter homily.Under a suddenly sun-drenched sky on Fifth Avenue, the festivities were a bit more free-flowing: flowers bloomed on the bonnets of children and sprouted from the ears of Chihuahuas, as marchers who finished the annual Easter Day parade in front of the church mingled with a band of protesters with signs.This small group of about 25 people stood while temperatures soared near 80 degrees, holding white placards bearing the pictures of eight members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community who had recently committed suicide or been killed in hate crimes. They were demonstrating against a recent spate of hate crimes and against the Roman Catholic Church’s position on same-sex marriage.“We’re not here as an aggressive protest,” said Scott Wooledge, 44, of Brooklyn Heights. “We’re here to reach out to people to make them understand that homophobia kills.”Dan Choi, a former lieutenant with the New York Army National Guard who was discharged under the now-repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell” law after announcing on national television that he is gay, stood somewhat anonymously with the group in a black suit and tie.“I want to give voice to these people,” he said, pointing to the signs, whose pictures included one of the Rutgers student Tyler Clementi, whose suicide has drawn national attention.'"
"'11-04-25,'0','WASHINGTON — Said Mohammed Alam Shah, a 24-year-old Afghan who had lost a leg as a teenager, told interrogators at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, that he had been conscripted by the Taliban as a driver before being detained in 2001. He had been caught, he said, as he tried to “rescue his younger brother from the Taliban.”Military analysts believed him. Mr. Shah, who had been outfitted with a prosthetic leg by prison doctors, was “cooperative” and “has not expressed thoughts of violence or made threats toward the U.S. or its allies,” according to a sympathetic 2003 assessment. Its conclusion: “Detainee does not pose a future threat to the U.S. or U.S. interests.”So in 2004 Mr. Shah was sent back to Afghanistan — where he promptly revealed himself to be Abdullah Mehsud, a Pakistan-born militant, and began plotting mayhem. He recorded jihadist videos, organized a Taliban force to fight American troops, planned an attack on Pakistan’s interior minister that killed 31 people, oversaw the kidnapping of two Chinese engineers, and finally detonated a suicide bomb in 2007 as the Pakistani Army closed in. His martyrdom was hailed in an audio message by none other than Osama bin Laden.The Guantánamo analysts’ complete misreading of Abdullah Mehsud was included among hundreds of classified assessments of detainees at the prison in Cuba that were obtained by The New York Times. The unredacted assessments give the fullest public picture to date of the prisoners held at Guantánamo over the past nine years. They show that the United States has imprisoned hundreds of men for years without trial based on a difficult and strikingly subjective evaluation of who they were, what they had done in the past and what they might do in the future. The 766 assessment documents use the word “possibly” 387 times, “unknown” 188 times and “deceptive” 85 times.Viewed with judges’ rulings on legal challenges by detainees, the documents reveal that the analysts sometimes ignored serious flaws in the evidence — for example, that the information came from other detainees whose mental illness made them unreliable. Some assessments quote witnesses who say they saw a detainee at a camp run by Al Qaeda but omit the witnesses’ record of falsehood or misidentification. They include detainees’ admissions without acknowledging other government documents that show the statements were later withdrawn, often attributed to abusive treatment or torture.Written between 2002 and 2009, the assessments reflect a growing wariness on the part of Guantánamo analysts. Early on, the reports are just a page or two and often sanguine in tone. By 2008, after scorching publicity about released detainees who joined Al Qaeda and the dwindling of the prison population to hard-core detainees, the assessments are decidedly more cautious.For every case of an Abdullah Mehsud — someone wrongly judged a minimal threat — there are several instances in which prisoners rated “high risk” were released and have not engaged in wrongdoing. Murat Kurnaz, a German resident of Turkish ancestry, was judged in a 2006 assessment to be a member of Al Qaeda who fell into the most dangerous category: “high risk” and “likely to pose a threat to the U.S., its interests and allies.”Nonetheless, American authorities, under pressure from both Germany and Turkey, overruled the analysts and sent Mr. Kurnaz home to Germany three months later. He did not join the global jihad but instead became a prominent critic of Guantánamo, writing a book and making countless media appearances to denounce the American prison.Among the most revealing of the leaked documents is a 17-page guide for analysts, evidently prepared by military intelligence trainers, on how to gauge the danger posed by a detainee. It lists major clusters of detainees, including the so-called Dirty 30, who were the bodyguards of Mr. bin Laden, as well as the large group of accused Qaeda operatives captured with Abu Zubaydah, an important terrorist facilitator, at two guesthouses in Faisalabad, Pakistan, in 2002. It lists nine mosques associated with Al Qaeda, in Quebec, Milan, London, Yemen and Pakistan.The guide shows how analysts seized upon the tiniest details as a potential litmus test for risk. If a prisoner had a Casio F91W watch, it might be an indication he had attended a Qaeda bomb-making course where such watches were handed out — though that model is sold around the world to this day. (Likewise, the assessment of a Yemeni prisoner suggests a dire use for his pocket calculator: “Calculators may be used for indirect fire calculations such as those required for artillery fire.”)A prisoner caught without travel documents? It might mean he had been trained to discard them to make identification harder, the guide explains. A detainee who claimed to be a simple farmer or a cook, or in the honey business or searching for a wife? Those were common Taliban and Qaeda cover stories, the analysts were told.And a classic Catch-22: “Refusal to cooperate,” the guide says, is a Qaeda resistance technique.Yet the guide appears to be the product of years of experience at trying to turn bits of evidence of varying reliability into a conclusion. Notably, it cites as a cautionary tale the early misjudgment about Abdullah Mehsud, the Pakistani suicide bomber, who had claimed he was forced to join the Taliban. He was “an example,” the guide says, “of a detainee who successfully applied the conscription cover story as a means to secure his release from U.S. custody.”'"
"'11-04-25,'0','Their efforts to promote bridge among students have helped revive a game that peaked in popularity in the years after World War II, and have redefined it from a leisurely pastime for the elderly to a game fit for interscholastic contests in which young players vie for trophies, scholarships and bragging rights.In 2009, a 9-year-old Georgia boy, Richard Jeng, became the youngest player to earn the rank of life master from the American Contract Bridge League, the nation’s largest bridge organization; the average age of its 165,000 members is 67. Three hundred top junior players are expected to compete in the fourth annual Youth North American Bridge Championships in Toronto in July, while hundreds more will play in local tournaments this year.“To see seventh and eighth graders sitting and concentrating for three hours, it never happens except in bridge,” said Bud Brewer, whose nonprofit group, Reno Youth Bridge, held a tournament in April after teaching the game to 160 students in 14 public middle schools and three private schools in Reno and Sparks, Nev.Similar youth bridge programs have cropped up in more than a dozen other cities, including Atlanta; Raleigh, N.C.; Pensacola, Fla.; Phoenix; and Honolulu. Atlanta Junior Bridge, which was started by bridge players in 2006, has taught the game to 1,700 students in after-school classes and summer camps, and this year it developed a math-based bridge curriculum that is being taught in schools like Buford Middle in the Atlanta suburbs.Leslie Markes, an eighth-grade math teacher at Buford, recalled that puzzled students asked at first whether they were going to build bridges. Now the 30-minute bridge class is so popular that she has to turn away students. “We wanted to teach them math in a new way,” she said. “But we didn’t bill it as ‘come take an extra math class.’ ”Bridge is a challenging game even for adults, requiring strategy and the memorization of complex rules. Yet evidence of its academic benefits is still largely anecdotal. A 2005 study by Christopher C. Shaw, a retired business professor and bridge player, found that a group of bridge-playing fifth-grade students in Carlinville, Ill., made larger gains on standardized tests than their classmates, but academic scholars have called these findings limited and preliminary. Mr. Shaw is conducting a similar bridge study with students in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.“My intuition says bridge is a really good tool to develop critical thinking and inferential reasoning, plus it gives them a lifetime recreational skill,” Dr. Shaw said.Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were persuaded by their own experience as bridge players to pledge $1 million in 2005 to promote bridge in schools.The money was used to help create School Bridge League, a program that generated interest in the game through introductory classes, online tournaments and presentations at teacher conferences. The efforts fell short, in part because schools were cutting programs, not adding them, and students found it hard to learn the game — let alone become regulars — with just a handful of lessons.School Bridge League’s founders eventually returned $400,000 to Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett in 2010. Nevertheless, they tried again last summer, reorganizing the program under Enith Berg, a retired teacher and bridge player. They are trying to build more comprehensive programs in fewer districts — Lakeland is one — by starting with younger children and a pared-down version of the game, known as mini-bridge.This time, the program is being run on a shoestring budget with donations from, among others, Jon Sandelman, a hedge-fund financier, and David Barger, chief executive of JetBlue, who donated 25 free airline tickets, some of which have been used as prizes in tournaments.In New York City this year, School Bridge League helped introduce the game at the Anderson School, a citywide school for gifted and talented students that teaches bridge to third graders. The school also created an elective class for middle school students, and held a family bridge night in March. Another school, Midtown West, has formed a bridge club for fourth and fifth graders and a bridge group for parents.“Unlike chess, it forces students to collaborate together,” said Dean Ketchum, the Midtown West principal. “And we’re providing families with an academic activity they can share for a lifetime.”Even schools where money is tight are finding a way to teach bridge. The Orange Township school district in New Jersey started bridge clubs for 30 students at two elementary schools last year after a gifted program offering bridge lessons was eliminated in budget cuts. Next fall, the district plans to expand the bridge clubs to two more schools in response to growing interest.George Stone, the superintendent of the 6,200-student Lakeland district, said he decided to introduce bridge in five elementary schools after learning the benefits from Ms. Berg, who is also his neighbor. He said he hoped to expand it to the middle and high schools. The School Bridge League, which pays for the program, has spent about $5,000 on cards, materials and bridge instructors for the students and staff.Dr. Stone is not a player himself. “I tried to learn, and I wasn’t as successful as our students,” he said. “Between the rules and memorization and thinking skills and logic and teamwork, it’s astounding the kids can adapt to it so quickly.”In Ms. Crowley-Bloss’s class recently, the second graders sat at desks arranged in fours and calculated points from their cards by writing out addition problems. Then the games began. Max, glancing at his partner, threw down an ace to win a trick.“I just like winning,” said Max, who also plays chess. “Bridge is more fun than chess because you have a partner to help you if you’re in a tough situation.”At the nearby Benjamin Franklin School, a fifth-grade class was reviewing bridge rules and vocabulary from a PowerPoint projection. One question: When someone gets a higher card than you, what do you call that? (Answer: Trump.)“Think Donald,” the teacher, Annamarie Conte, told the students before they gathered up their cards and sat down to play.“It kind of teaches us math, but I like it better than math,” said Jack Schwerner, 10, who ranked bridge ahead of video games, but behind football.Patricia McIlvenny, the principal, said the lessons in teamwork and cooperation learned around the bridge table were as important as the academic ones.“You can’t text your partner your strategy,” she said. “You actually have to put down your cellphone and interact around a table. It’s reintroducing a lot of social skills that have been lost.”'"
"'11-04-25,'0','First-quarter earnings, due this week for several big United States oil companies, are set to emit a positive glow. But even the stocks that should be most responsive to oil prices, like Chevron and Hess, no longer seem to be tracking higher.Chevron has already said it was paid about $10 more for a barrel of crude oil in the first three months of this year than in the previous quarter. And since then, the price of Brent crude has surged even higher. Chevron pumps much more crude than cheaper natural gas. Along with other firms like Hess and Occidental Petroleum, that makes its earnings and stock price relatively sensitive to the oil price. Compared with rivals, these companies also have less of their output tied up in production-sharing agreements, in which governments grab more as prices rise.As a result, earnings per share at Chevron climb about 20 percent for a $10 increase in the price of oil, according to Credit Suisse. By contrast, profit at Total, a French company with less oil and more production-sharing agreements, gets just a 7 percent boost. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are examples that fall somewhere in between.But increasingly expensive crude seems to be losing its effect on oil stocks. Not even Hess, which Credit Suisse reckons gets a 30 percent profit increase for every $10 lift in the oil price, has kept pace with the roughly 40 percent rise in the price of Brent crude over the past year.One interpretation is that investors don’t think current prices are sustainable. Sanford Bernstein estimates that the shares of major European oil companies are priced for oil at $90 a barrel, about a quarter below the current price. Above $100 a barrel, demand is at risk. In addition, crude oil spikes aren’t usually good news for refining and marketing margins, since the extra costs can’t easily be passed on.All this means that despite benefiting from high prices in the first quarter, oil executives may not applaud further increases. That applies especially to the companies whose stocks have gained the most. If costly barrels start to chip away at demand, those companies are likely to be the first to suffer.'"
"'11-04-25,'0','The probable historical importance of the shipwreck, which was discovered by fishermen off Belitung Island in Indonesia in 1998, has only inflamed the debate.The ship, which is believed to be Arab, was filled with a cargo of ninth-century Chinese ceramics and gold and silver vessels. Its discovery suggests that Tang China had substantial sea trade with the Middle East; scholars had previously thought that the trade routes were primarily over land, along the Silk Road.The exhibition “brings to life the tale of Sinbad sailing to China to make his fortune,” Mr. Raby said this year. (Mr. Raby declined to be interviewed for this article, according to a spokeswoman, because he wanted to keep an open mind for Monday’s discussion.)Archaeologists, however, say that because the shipwreck was commercially mined within a period of months, rather than the many years that a more structured archaeological excavation would have taken, much of the information it might have provided about the ship’s crew and cargo was lost.Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archeologist and vice chairwoman of the nongovernmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology, said in an e-mail that by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian — which is a research institution as well as a network of museums — would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites.Commercial treasure hunting is a high-stakes world. Companies sometimes spend millions of dollars searching for and mining a shipwreck and then cleaning up the finds in the hope of selling the artifacts for a huge profit at the end.The company that salvaged the Belitung wreck, Seabed Explorations, is run by a German engineer, Tilman Walterfang. In the early 1990s Mr. Walterfang was a director at a concrete company in Germany when his Indonesian employees’ stories about the rumors of shipwrecks lying on the bottom of the ocean in Indonesia prompted him to move across the world.Although a 2001 Unesco convention outlawed the commercial trade in underwater heritage, Indonesia has not ratified it. (Neither has the United States.) Indonesia allows commercial mining of shipwrecks as long as a company is licensed and splits its finds with the government.In an e-mail Mr. Walterfang said that when fisherman first discovered the shipwreck in early August 1998, the Indonesian government, fearful of looting, ordered Seabed Explorations to begin an immediate round-the-clock recovery operation. It started within days.Although Mr. Walterfang eventually brought in a pair of archaeologists, including one, Michael Flecker, who wrote two journal articles about the ship, Mr. Walterfang conceded that, from an academic standpoint, “the overall situation would without doubt be described as ‘less than ideal.’ ”After fielding interest from China, Seabed Explorations sold the majority of the 63,000 artifacts recovered to a company owned by the Singapore government, for $32 million.The Indonesian government kept slightly more than 8,000 objects from this ship, along with $2.5 million and finds from another ship excavated by Mr. Walterfang. Some artifacts have ended up on eBay and other online sites; Mr. Walterfang said that these were probably looted by fishermen while the recovery process was halted for the monsoon season, between December 1998 and March 1999.Mr. Walterfang was dismissive of the exhibition’s critics, suggesting that the exhibition was being used as a “Ping-Pong ball in yet another political game for the social climbers in Washington, D.C.”Mr. Flecker, the archaeologist who studied the ship, argued in a 2002 article in The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology that the purist approach of many archaeologists was not practical in developing countries like Indonesia, where governments are poor and the risk of looting is high.In those circumstances, he wrote, archaeologists and commercial salvagers should cooperate “to document those sites and the artifacts recovered from them before too much information is lost.”But in the eyes of archaeologists like James P. Delgado, the director of maritime heritage at the United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, allowing any of the finds from an excavation to be sold betrays the most basic aspects of research, in which “sometimes it’s the smallest things that we come back to that make the great leaps forward.”Mr. Delgado said he wished the Belitung shipwreck had been academically excavated. But unlike some of his colleagues, he said that instead of canceling the exhibition, the Smithsonian could use it to educate the public about the consequences of the commercialization of underwater heritage.If, however, the exhibition merely celebrates the discovery without addressing the problematic context, Mr. Delgado added, “there will be a clear message to Indonesia” that these practices “are fine,” and to other countries with rich maritime heritage to “engage in these things and sell it off.”'"
"'11-04-25,'0','Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also called for robust air support for the rebels and told CNN that NATO forces should bomb Col. Qaddafi’s inner circle. “I think the focus should now be to cut the head of the snake off,” he said.Mr. McCain told CNN that he supported the first missile attack from a drone aircraft in Libya as fighting in the rebel-held city of Misurata became increasingly bloody. “I’m glad the Predator is now in the fight,” McCain said. “We need the American air assets back in a heavier way.”The unmanned plane was used for the first time in the conflict in Libya on Saturday to attack a site near Misurata. But the Obama administration is deeply resistant to expanding American military involvement. The administration last week authorized the use of armed drones in Libya and a $25 million contribution of nonlethal military surplus for the rebel forces.Mr. McCain’s warning of a stalemate in Libya echoed comments on Friday by the top American military officer. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that a month of airstrikes had destroyed 30 percent to 40 percent of the capabilities of the military forces loyal to Col. Qaddafi, but had not yet drastically tilted the conflict with opposition militias one way or another. He cited shifts in tactics by Libyan forces that made it difficult for NATO warplanes to distinguish them from the rebel fighters and civilians.Britain and France have been leading air strikes against Col. Qaddafi’s forces in a NATO-supported operation mandated by the United Nations Security Council in the name of protecting civilians from atrocities.Mr. McCain said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program that the United States should increase its role in North Atlantic Treaty Organization air attacks against Libya, saying that only six NATO nations were engaged in the conflict. He also reiterated his call for the United States to recognize the rebels’ governing council as the country’s legitimate government, as France, Italy and Qatar have done. He has previously called for the United States to provide the rebels with money and arms on a scale similar to what the United States did in support of those who fought the Soviet Union’s occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.He also insisted that destroying Col. Qaddafi’s television broadcast capabilities could prove instrumental in depriving him of the propaganda machine he was using to try and frighten the Libyan people in submission.'"
"'11-04-25,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — Dozens of residents have disappeared in Syria since Friday, many of them from the restive city of Homs and towns on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, human rights activists said Sunday, amid signs that the Syrian government may widen its crackdown on a five-week uprising that has already killed hundreds.The disappearances were yet another indication that the government’s decision to lift emergency rule, in place since 1963, might prove more rhetoric than reform. Though the government has proclaimed the law’s repeal on Thursday as a sweeping step, the past few days have proven some of the bloodiest and most repressive since the uprising began.On Friday, at least 109 people were killed, as security forces fired on protesters in 14 towns and cities. At least 12 more were killed Saturday, when mourners sought to bury the dead from the day before. Another person was reported killed Sunday in Jabla, where security forces fired on residents after the visit of the governor. “We don’t trust this regime anymore,” one protester there said. “We’re sick of it.”Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to set up an international inquiry into the deaths and urged the United States and Europe to impose sanctions on officials responsible for the shootings and the detentions of hundreds of protesters.“After Friday’s carnage, it is no longer enough to condemn the violence,” said Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director at the organization, which is based in New York.'"
"'11-04-25,'0','BANGKOK — Thai and Cambodian troops clashed for a third day on Sunday in the first major territorial encounter since an informal cease-fire that followed four days of fighting in February. At least 10 people were killed and thousands of residents were evacuated from border areas, according to reports from both sides.The United Nations called on the countries to settle the conflict peacefully, with an effective and verifiable cease-fire. The exact cause of the latest clash, which began early Friday, was unclear, with the two sides accusing each other of making the first move in what was mostly a long-range artillery duel.The fighting was reported at border areas 100 miles west of Preah Vihear, an 11th-century temple that has been the focus of armed tensions since it was listed in 2008 by the United Nations as a World Heritage site under Cambodian administration.Both nations claim ownership of a strategic area of 1.8 square miles near Preah Vihear. Two other ancient Hindu temples in the border area are the focus of the latest eruption of fighting.In his weekly television address, the prime minister of Thailand, Abhisit Vejjajiva, accused Cambodia of starting the fighting. “When there is firing into Thailand, we must fire back,” he said.Mr. Abhisit added: “We must not fall into Cambodia’s trap in trying to spread a picture of conflict, or say the conflict is unsolvable through bilateral talks.”'"

"'11-04-26,'1','It may be a difficult case to prove, but the complaint filed last month by the National Labor Relations Board against Boeing is a welcome effort to defend workers’ right to collective bargaining.The N.L.R.B. is accusing the company of setting up a nonunion production line in South Carolina to retaliate against unionized workers in Washington State for striking. The board wants to force Boeing to make all of its new Dreamliner jets in Washington, rather than make 30 percent of them at the new line in Charleston.The case hinges on proving Boeing’s intent. It is illegal to retaliate against workers for striking — there have been four strikes at the Washington facility since 1989 — or threaten workers in order to discourage strikes. But the company can decide to locate production in South Carolina because it makes business sense and may include “production stability” as a factor in its decision.Boeing says it wants to diversify its assembly to make it less vulnerable to disruptions caused by potential future strikes. Further complicating the N.L.R.B.’s case, Boeing says opening the line in South Carolina will not lead to layoffs in Washington, where it is adding jobs, too.The N.L.R.B.’s action lands squarely on an ambiguity in the nation’s labor protections — which enshrine the right to collective bargaining yet allow companies ways to avoid it by going to another state.Today, 1 out of 13 private sector workers is in a union, down from about 1 in 4 in the early 1970s. Many forces are contributing to this erosion, including globalization and the decline of manufacturing. But one important force is the flight of companies to “right-to-work” states where workers cannot be required to join a union. Currently, unionized workers nationally make 19 percent more than nonunion workers, on average.The N.L.R.B.’s case rests on statements by Boeing officials that, it believes, prove retaliation. One Boeing executive told The Seattle Times that the main reason to put the new line in South Carolina was “that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','That testimony goes to the heart of the defense’s theory that many others were to blame for the deadly blaze besides their clients.When inspectors from agencies like the State Department of Labor and the United States Environmental Protection Agency went to inspect the building weeks after the standpipe fell, they examined many pipes closely, but no one ever raised the issue of the missing pipe, Mr. Ortiz said under cross-examination by Mr. Alvo’s lawyer, Susan Hoffinger.Asked by Mr. Melofchik’s lawyer, Edward J. M. Little, why he had never brought up the issue of the missing standpipe to regulators, Mr. Ortiz said the workers were often ignored. “They would kind of say our opinion had no value,” Mr. Ortiz testified.Mr. Little also tried to show on cross-examination that Mr. Ortiz himself might not have been truthful about which pipe in the basement was the standpipe.Mr. Ortiz testified last week that a pipe toward the front of a photograph of the basement was part of the standpipe. But using a prosecution diagram of the standpipe system, Mr. Little showed that the pipe Mr. Ortiz pointed to was not a part of the standpipe.The defense has argued that the basement of the building was a morass of pipes that were not easily distinguished from one another. Even if their clients knew a pipe had fallen, they did not know that it was the standpipe, the defense has argued.Under questioning by Mr. DePaola’s lawyer, Rick Pasacreta, Mr. Ortiz acknowledged that his supervisor had never told him that the pipe was a standpipe.Mr. Ortiz also testified that after work in the basement was finished, he went to work on some of the building’s upper floors, and while working there, that he was not concerned that the missing standpipe presented a safety issue.In addition, Mr. Ortiz shed light on possible tension between two of the defendants, Mr. Alvo and Mr. DePaola. Mr. DePaola stopped working at the building in May 2007.“He didn’t agree with Mitch on some things,” Mr. Ortiz said. The two men “had different points of view,” he added, saying, “I don’t know if he was fired or if he left.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Shifting allegiances and legal battles in the world of location services suggest competition in this market is heating up.Apple initially relied on technology from Skyhook Wireless, a company that was a pioneer in the technique of using Wi-Fi hot spots for location. But last year it began collecting its own data as well. And late last year, Skyhook sued Google, charging that Google had copied its technology and persuaded Motorola to break contracts with Skyhook and use Google’s competing service.Google and Apple have said that they collect the information anonymously and use it to keep their databases of Wi-Fi hot spots up to date, not to track individuals. But because a person’s location is delicate information, the practices have raised privacy fears.The use of this data by the companies has been under scrutiny since last week, when two technology researchers reported that a file stored on many iPhones and iPads keeps track of all the locations visited by a user. The file is unencrypted and is copied to people’s personal computers when they sync their devices.The report prompted lawmakers in the United States to ask Apple for explanations. Several European governments said they would open investigations into Apple’s practices. On Monday, two customers sued Apple accusing it of privacy invasion and computer fraud. They contend the company is secretly recording and storing the location and movement of iPhone and iPad users.Late last week, Google said it was collecting information about nearby networks from Android users, though it said that it was not tracking individuals and that it allowed users to decline to participate.Lisa Madigan, the attorney general of Illinois, wrote to Google and Apple on Monday asking them to explain their location data collection practices.Apple has declined to comment on the matter.On Monday, the Web site MacRumors published an e-mail said to be from Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and chief executive, in which he replied to a person who had said he planned to switch to a Google Android phone because Google did not track him. The reply said: “Oh yes they do. We don’t track anyone. The info circulating around is false.”Apple declined to confirm the authenticity of the e-mail.Some security specialists said they believed Apple was not tracking people, but rather collecting data to update its location databases, since Wi-Fi networks can quickly come and go. A letter sent from Apple in July to two members of Congress, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, appears to confirm this and provides the most detailed explanation of the technology.In the letter, Apple said it collects the location data anonymously and only when consumers agree to use its location-based services like maps, or any apps that ask for a user’s location, and for its advertising system, iAds. The company said it began relying on its own databases for location information in 2010. Explaining its need to collect data from its customers’ phones, Apple wrote, “These databases must be updated continuously.”Security researchers said that they believed that the file with location data stored on iPhones and iPads was meant as a “cache” that would help the device pinpoint its whereabouts faster, and that it could help feed Apple’s giant database of network locations. But they said Apple should have been more diligent about encrypting the file and deleting old data.“I don’t know why they would want to keep all that data on the device,” said Mark Seiden, an information security consultant in Silicon Valley.Skyhook began collecting data about Wi-Fi hot spots by sending a fleet of more than 500 cars to drive around the streets of every major city in the United States, Europe and many Asian countries.“We drove the world,” said Ted Morgan, Skyhook’s chief executive. The company updates the database by sending its cars to remap certain areas and by using phones as sensors when a user requests location data.Google, which initially collected data on Wi-Fi hot spots with the same fleet of cars that was taking photos for its StreetView service, said it stopped doing so last year after it was found to have collected e-mails and other data streamed through those hot spots. It now collects much of that data and traffic information, through customers’ phones.Mobile advertising could be a $2.5 billion market by 2015, according to Frost & Sullivan, and ads tied to a location are much more lucrative than other ads. But Mr. Morgan said the location data could be valuable in areas beyond the Internet and mobile phones.For example, a retailer that has eight outlets in a city could use data about walking patterns to determine where to open its next outlet.“You are basically getting insight into human behavior that we’ve never had before,” Mr. Morgan said.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','“The question is, what is the exchange of the future?” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, an banking and brokerage firm. “Both want to compete globally but Nasdaq is saying, hey, we think the best way to compete globally is to stay as narrowly focused as possible. NYSE is saying, hey, you need to be diversified to compete and have global capabilities.”The strategy of the Deutsche Börse calls for the combined company to trade stocks as well as higher-margin, faster-growing in both and the .“It is a bigger international play,” said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group.Nasdaq’s vision is built on dominating stock trading in the United States. It would have some international equity trading, like its current OMX operations in the Nordic and Baltic countries, as well NYSE Euronext exchanges in European centers like and .But the merger would make the combined business the home of all the companies listed in the United States, responsible for 45 percent to 50 percent of domestic trading volume. Issuers, including overseas companies, might prefer a bigger, unified American capital market compared with the fragmented one now.On Thursday the fate of the Big Board is likely to take center stage at the annual shareholder meeting of NYSE Euronext in . But the final outcome may be decided only by a shareholder vote scheduled for July.The deal with the Deutsche Börse — which went mainly electronic more than a decade ago and has only about 120 traders on its floor in — would give NYSE Euronext a much bigger share of the market for exchange-based derivatives trading in Europe, including interest rate derivatives as well as NYSE Euronext’s 27 percent share of cash stock market trading in the United States.Under the Nasdaq-ICE bid, NYSE Euronext would be split into two. The NYSE Euronext’s stock-trading operations, including the NYSE floor, would go to Nasdaq, while ICE would pick up most of the derivatives businesses in the United States and Europe.NYSE’s board has twice rebuffed the Nasdaq-ICE bid, even though Mr. Greifeld sweetened his offer last week with firmer bank financing and an offer to pay a $350 million break-up fee to NYSE Euronext if regulators veto the deal.The NYSE Euronext board said it still prefers to merge with the Deutsche Börse, because that deal would keep the company intact, and emphasize the global cross-product strategy, while they argue an Nasdaq-ICE combination would run afoul of antitrust rules.The Nasdaq-ICE bid is also a bet on the superiority of purely electronic trading. From its headquarters in Times Square, Nasdaq has done more than anyone else to draw business away and diminish the exchange, and in the shift to electronic trading the Big Board itself adopted ever more automation and set up its own electronic-only market, called Arca.Even on the floor of the exchange itself, most trading is conducted electronically, with the floor brokers and market makers usually intervening manually only at the busiest times or when the computers go haywire, as in last May’s flash crash.The Nasdaq-ICE bid is worth more upfront — offering $42.84 a share vs. Deutsche Börse’s $37.76, based on their current stock prices. It also foresees greater cost savings: Nasdaq and ICE together expect to save about $740 million in the next three years, a figure driven by eliminating duplicate back-end technologies and cutting jobs. Nasdaq also plans to close either NYSE’s data center or its own data complex, both of which are in .By contrast, the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger initially called for $400 million in cost savings, although Duncan L. Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, raised this estimate by another $150 million on Monday.Mr. Greifeld said the Deutsche Börse proposal would create an unwieldy “financial supermarket.” But by focusing on equities in the United States, Nasdaq might be cutting itself off from faster growth areas overseas and higher-margin derivatives trading.“It is better to be diverse from a geographic point of view and a product point of view,” said Justin Schack, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, who said the Deutsche Börse option is preferable. “If you are going to be in the cash equities business, you had better also be in the higher-margin, faster-growing derivatives business, and Nasdaq will still lack a significant presence there.”Nasdaq may also face headwinds from antitrust regulators worried about the combined company’s outsized market share. On the other hand, working in its favor is the political issue of a foreign exchange taking over what many people view as more than just another company.“Do people want a German flag flying over Wall Street?” said Sang Lee of the Aite Group, a financial services consulting company.At the same time, the prospect of the New York Stock Exchange falling into Mr. Greifeld’s care has left many people in the industry asking whether the venerable floor will survive, or whether after more than two centuries what is arguably the most famous trading venue in the world will finally be closed.The Big Board’s management insists the human touch, however limited, still plays a crucial role. The traders on the floor can listen for rumors about big deals, and sound out the market in ways a computer cannot, they argue.“There is manual intervention in special situations where there is stress, or volatility, at the open or close of trading or public offerings,” said Joseph M. Mecane, administrative officer for United States markets at NYSE Euronext.Rather than the trading, the real value of the floor may instead be its historical symbolism — the biggest companies pay $500,000 a year just to list their shares on the Big Board and have their executives seen on television ringing the opening bell, more than they pay on Nasdaq where the top fee is $100,000.It is what Mr. Schack calls the premium of being “the soundstage of American capitalism” — a premium that whoever wins the takeover battle will want to preserve.Mr. Greifeld said he recognizes “the ceremonial value to listed companies” of the exchange’s historic floor.“We have always recognized that,” he said in an interview. “We will want to keep that aspect of it.”But he said NYSE Euronext’s hybrid man-and-machine approach has failed. Any future for the floor will have to recognize the reality that the electronic market has won.“It is over,” he said. “The trading that existed down the centuries has died. We have an electronic market today. It is the present. It is the future.”Still, Mr. Greifeld said he wants to persuade the stock traders who operate the computers now scattered around the world to come back to the floor, with its 74-foot ceiling and marble walls.“When you look at the floor today you can see it is certainly underutilized,” he said.“There is nobody there during the day. The floor is desolate. It is embarrassing how empty it is. The floor that existed 10 years ago, that has been essentially dismantled. The result is you have an empty cavernous building. Now the question is, How do you fill it back up?”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','WASHINGTON — Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi had hired a campaign manager, lined up influential Republican activists in early-voting states and secured commitments from donors across the country, but he surprised them all on Monday by announcing that he was abandoning his effort to join the Republican presidential race.In a telephone call to supporters, followed by a brief statement, Mr. Barbour said he lacked the “absolute fire in the belly,” that a candidacy would require. He apologized for flirting with a presidential bid over the last six months and then backing away, but said he had concluded that he was not ready to dedicate himself to the “all-consuming effort” a campaign would require.“I cannot offer that with certainty,” he said, “and total certainty is required.”The decision by Mr. Barbour, 63, provided the biggest shake-up yet of the 2012 presidential race. His departure adds another layer of uncertainty to the wide-open fight for the party’s nomination and set off a scramble among other candidates seeking to sign up his donors and supporters.Throughout the spring, Mr. Barbour has been traveling to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, testing his support among Republicans who cast the first votes. He recruited a team of operatives in those states, along with national campaign strategists, and rivals expected him to join the first Republican debate next week in South Carolina.But his candidacy faced many challenges. As a lobbyist, for example, he represented tobacco companies, the pharmaceutical industry and several foreign governments. He sought to sell the experience as an advantage, telling audiences, “I saw the sausage factory up close,” but his aides braced for intense scrutiny.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Still, the comparisons made by analysts underscored just how fast Netflix has picked up customers. Two years ago, it had 10 million customers and was largely a DVD-by-mail service; today it is a force in video streaming.Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that it had benefited from a “virtuous cycle” of “increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an expanding device ecosystem.” (The service is often connected to devices like video game consoles and Internet-ready television sets, which have rapidly proliferated and have driven Netflix’s subscriber growth.) It reported worldwide revenue of $719 million for the quarter, up 46 percent over the same period last year, and $60 million in net income, up 88 percent over the same period last year.Netflix’s streaming service costs $7.99 a month. To keep customers paying for unlimited access to its library of films and TV shows, Netflix must maintain its own access to that content. Last month, it announced that it had bought the exclusive rights to a show, “House of Cards,” that Media Rights Capital is producing. This month it paid Lionsgate for the rights to stream archived seasons of the AMC series “Mad Men” and paid Twentieth Century Fox for the rights to the Fox series “Glee,” among others.But at the same time, the pay cable channels Starz and Showtime are becoming more restrictive about Netflix’s access to their content. Netflix is trying to make the case that its streaming deals benefit all players because when users watch past seasons of shows, they are then more likely to watch current seasons shown by a cable provider or broadcaster. “We hope over time that HBO and Showtime will let us prove this proposition for them,” the company wrote in the shareholder letter.Referring to its licensing of “House of Cards,” Netflix wrote that it would seek two or three “similar, but smaller deals” for exclusive content.Mr. Hastings said having shows like “Glee” and, “House of Cards” would “continue to help us get more subscribers, which then helps us to afford to license more content.”So far, Netflix is the only major player in the online-only video subscription business, but others are playing catch-up. Some cable and satellite operators are bragging about their own video streaming options: last week, for instance, when the Dish Network introduced HBO’s streaming service, HBO Go, it promoted movies that were “not offered by Netflix’s online service.” HBO Go requires an existing subscription to HBO through a cable or satellite operator, so Netflix does not consider it a direct competitor.But Mr. Hastings acknowledged Monday that “there will be a number of substantial competitors” in the online streaming space in the future. One competitor, he said, could be the Dish Network, which bought the bankrupt Blockbuster in a bid valued at $228 million in cash this month. Analysts immediately suggested that a war between Netflix and Blockbuster could be brewing.Netflix wrote to shareholders on Monday, “Our competitive strategy relative to other streaming services is simply to grow as fast as we can, so we can afford more content, more marketing, and more R&D than our competitors.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','But team officials will probably be unable to have contact with players if they do show up.Jim Quinn, who argued the players’ case before Nelson, said Monday night that teams were theoretically allowed to sign free agents now, but that players had to give the N.F.L. time to let the dust settle. If it takes too long to begin signing players without a stay in place, owners could be subject to collusion charges, he said.One agent, Brad Blank, said Monday night that he had contacted several of his clients and told them that they should contact their player representatives and be prepared to report to their teams’ off-season training programs.One legal analyst, Gabe Feldman of Tulane Law School, who has done work for NFL Network, said the league had to be given time to reopen business, adding that if players show up, they could be told that while they are no longer being locked out, owners need more time to get up and running.In a telephone interview, Quinn said: “It’s one more loss in a long line of losses in court for them. From the players’ perspective, it wasn’t at all unexpected. It was a very well-reasoned decision. Therefore, we think it is upheld on appeal.”In its filing to seek a stay, the N.F.L. said it could be subjected to further antitrust charges by players and it would be impossible to “unscramble the eggs” if business were to reopen, only to have the appeals court reinstate the lockout. It also said that by enjoining the lockout, the district court created new law on three issues that the Court of Appeals will review.“We believe that federal law bars injunctions in labor disputes,” the league said in a statement. “We are confident that the Eighth Circuit will agree.”That premise, contained in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, was rejected by Nelson in her 89-page decision, in which she wrote that she did not believe the act applied to the N.F.L.’s dispute with players because the union has disbanded. She accepted that the union’s decertification, which the league contended was merely a negotiating ploy, was valid. She wrote that she had discretion to decide whether to cede jurisdiction to the National Labor Relations Board. The league filed a charge with the N.L.R.B. in February that the union had not negotiated in good faith and that its decertification was a sham, intended only as a bargaining tactic.Nelson also wrote that players were already suffering the threat of irreparable harm from the lockout even though no games have been missed. She pointed especially to free agents like Peyton Manning and Logan Mankins, making the case that they are suffering because a lockout prevents them from negotiating with teams. Finally, Nelson said that the public interest, fans, does not favor a lockout.“The public ramifications of this dispute exceed the abstract principles of the antitrust laws, ranging from broadcast revenues down to concession sales,” Nelson wrote. “And of course the public interest represented by the fans of professional football — who have a strong investment in the 2011 season — is an intangible interest that weighs against the lockout. In short, this particular employment dispute is far from a purely private argument over compensation.”Nelson’s decision did not come as a surprise to either the players or the league after she made several comments from the bench during a hearing earlier this month that indicated some of her opinions. Now the N.F.L. will cast its lot with the Court of Appeals.The N.F.L. has long thought it has a better chance for success at the appeals court level than at the district court. But legal experts are divided.William Gould, a former chairman of the N.L.R.B., said in a telephone interview Monday night that the Eighth Circuit was the league’s best chance because he regards it as a very conservative court that is particularly management-friendly.“They couldn’t have a better court in the country, the owners,” Gould said. “Even when I was chairman of the N.L.R.B., this was one of the most unreceptive courts for any order aimed at an employer.”If the appeals court upholds the injunction, the league will be forced to open its doors for the first time since the lockout began March 12. That would give players considerable leverage over owners in negotiations to settle the antitrust litigation in which the sides have been engaged since talks broke off and the players union decertified.But if the appeals court overturns Nelson’s decision, the lockout will be back in place, and players will lose much of their leverage. With players facing the prospect of missing paychecks when the season starts — most players are not losing money yet — the lawyers for the players would be under pressure to reach a settlement that would let the players return to work and the season to begin.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Internet posts by analysts and Chinese aviation enthusiasts point to a fighter crammed with the best technology China can produce: holographic “heads-up” instrument displays, advanced anti-ship radar and, Mr. Lan said, self-guiding missiles, in contrast to the gravity-controlled bombs and sight-guided missiles that largely populate China’s existing 3,200-aircraft fleet.When it is deployed — probably sometime after 2015 — the J-15 will signal the dawn of a new ability by China to assert authority along its coastline.The carrier and its jet are said to employ the best Chinese technology, but both are also direct descendants of weaponry devised in the dying days of the old Soviet Union.China’s new carrier, expected to be christened the Shi Lang, is a retrofitted version of a 1988 Soviet aircraft carrier that Chinese interests bought from Ukraine after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, supposedly for conversion into a floating casino in Macao. But the Macao gambling license never materialized, and as many had suspected, the ship wound up elsewhere — in Dalian, a city in northeastern China where workers began a decade-long retrofit.The J-15 has followed an even more tortuous route.At the century’s turn, many news reports say, the Chinese beseeched Moscow to sell them a Sukhoi-33, a 1980s Soviet fighter capable of landing on carriers. Moscow refused. But in 2001, the Chinese bought an Su-33 prototype from Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, and began a teardown to learn its secrets.Yet the J-15 unofficially unveiled this week, which externally seems a clone of the Su-33, in fact has been remade inside with Chinese improvements. Mr. Lan said that advances in the plane’s outdated avionics and missile-guidance systems had made it a far more sophisticated version of the Russian jet.The J-15 is being compared in some quarters to the American F-18, a workhorse on Navy carriers. But Mr. Lan said it had a shorter range, in large part because its takeoff method — flying off a ski-jump-style runway — dictated that it could carry less fuel than a comparable American jet, which is propelled off a flat carrier runway.Flying a ski-jump is not duck soup. And in February, a Ukrainian court convicted a Russian man of conspiring to give the Chinese details of a Crimean air base that had been used to train Su-33 pilots to take off from a carrier’s ski-jump ramp.In Huludao, a navy installation on China’s northeast coast, workers are said to have built a rough clone of the Crimea test center, complete with a ski ramp for ascending jets.None of this is exceptional. Russian, Chinese and American espionage agents wage unacknowledged wars to steal the others’ technology.But the Chinese, some experts say, are notably adept.“They take what they can get, and improve what they can,” Abraham M. Denmark, an independent expert on China’s military in Washington, said in an interview. “It’s a strategy that permeates many of their innovations.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Some villagers just cannot break the habit, said Nutcharin Yanarangsri, a volunteer at a government health clinic in the village here who spends her days walking from house to house with a singular message: “Say no to raw fish!”“We tell them, ‘If you really want to eat it, you’d better boil it or cook it,”’ Ms. Nutcharin said during one of her rounds through the village. “But they tell me, ‘Eating it raw is so delicious. I can’t stop. I love it!”’Whether it is a green papaya salad with just the right mix of sweet and sour or a duck curry swimming in spices, the cuisine of Thailand is a national passion. The country’s 65 million people seem to spend their waking hours either talking about food or consuming it.But the Thai love of food has a masochistic side. It is not uncommon for office workers to lunch on searingly hot chili-laced dishes only to rush to the bathroom a few hours later with a bad case of Bangkok belly.The love of fermented foods, especially in northeastern Thailand, is the extreme version of this gourmand obsession — and that love is often heedless of the consequences.One popular dish in northeast Thailand is called pla som, or sour fish, which is made by mixing raw fish, garlic, salt, steamed rice and a pinch of seasoning powder. The mixture is shaped into egg-size portions, put into plastic bags and left to sit in the tropical heat for three days. That is not nearly long enough to kill the parasites, which die only after at least six months of fermentation.Liver flukes are present only in fresh water, but they are not found everywhere. The rate of infection in Bangkok, a five-hour drive away, is close to zero.Transmitted through feces, the parasites thrive in rural areas without proper sanitation, and they rely on snails, fish, cats and humans as hosts. Yet villagers do not see fermented fish as a dangerous thrill.This is not analogous to the tradition in Japan of eating fugu, the puffer fish that is potentially toxic when prepared the wrong way.The deadly effects of eating parasite-infected raw fish accumulate over decades, in the same way that drinking large amounts of alcohol over a lifetime can damage one’s liver. (Heavy drinking increases the chance of bile duct cancer for those infected with the parasite, Dr. Banchob said.)Somewhere between 1 percent and 5 percent of people infected with the parasites contract liver cancer.Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia also have high rates of liver cancer, according to statistics from the United Nations. Dr. Banchob estimates that about 10 percent of the population in Laos is infected with liver flukes.Dr. Hotez of the Sabin Institute said that the parasite is similar to other worms and ailments that get less attention because they rarely afflict wealthy urban populations. “Even though Thailand is a middle-class country, there are still pockets of intense poverty — and with that poverty come high rates of neglected tropical diseases,” Dr. Hotez said. “We’ve got the technology to make vaccines. But we don’t have the funding.”Dr. Cherdchai Tontisirin, a surgeon in Khon Kaen who has operated on liver cancer patients, blames the Thai government for the persistence of the disease. More could be done to make sure villagers stop eating raw fish, he said.“The government has never taken this seriously,” Dr. Cherdchai said. “This is a disease that affects only the north and the northeast, and these are regions that have been forgotten for a long time.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','There is nothing quite like first-round playoff panic. It happens when a heavily favored team, built over the long haul for the championship push, finds itself bedeviled by an upstart underdog. And sure, it’s going on in Los Angeles as the Lakers search for the proper rolled-up newspaper with which to swat the Hornets in an N.B.A. playoff series they are inexplicably not leading, but the Lakers have absolutely nothing on the Vancouver Canucks.By now, 40 years without an N.H.L. championship and recent seemingly strong teams having folded up like cheap lawn chairs in the playoffs, Vancouver might consider a Canucks-collapse warning system — perhaps there’s an old air raid siren sitting around somewhere — because the metaphorical version can be heard all the way to Nova Scotia. A 3-0 series lead over Chicago has evaporated, the franchise goalie is picking up pieces of his ego with tweezers and the stars of the mighty No. 1 seed are skating around in circles muttering in Swedish. Who needs those canceled soap operas? You couldn’t even write a script for this.You knew Sunday’s Game 6 was going to be wild as soon as Canucks Coach Alain Vignault decided before the game to bench goalie Roberto Luongo — yeah, the guy who won the Olympic gold medal for Canada last year and has 11 years left on a 12-year contract — which Yahoo.com’s Jeff Passan attributes to sheer panic because Chicago has now tormented Luongo three straight years in the playoffs. Oh sure, why not start a rookie backup in Game 6 in Chicago? When that rookie, Cory Schneider, coughed up two goals on his own turnovers and then went into full body spasm in giving up the tying goal in the third, they had to summon Luongo out of a back room (no joke) to enter the game, in a twist Darren Eliot of SI.com is still trying to get his head around. Of course, Luongo gave up Chicago’s winner in overtime because the Blackhawks have rented space in his head, writes David Haugh of The Chicago Tribune. Now, the Canucks have until Tuesday to convince themselves that Game 7 at home is just how things should be. Good luck with that, writes Cam Cole in The Vancouver Sun.While everyone is transfixed by the Canucks’ theatrics, the Predators finally won the first playoff series in their history, which David Climer writes in The Tennessean is a reason for Nashville to celebrate its unlikeliest successful team.Because the N.H.L. is featured on a channel you need a team of search dogs to find on your on-screen guide, those theatrics have gotten about a thousandth of the attention of the Lakers’. Their crisis is being caused largely by New Orleans’s Chris Paul, who played another otherworldly game in Game 4 Sunday, writes J.A. Adande on ESPN.com. Paul later said that he was inspired by an Easter church service, writes Marc Spears on Yahoo.com, which might have the Hornets considering a daily Mass instead of a morning shootaround before games. The Lakers, as Billy Witz writes on Foxsports.com, might be praying for a defensive answer for Paul because having Kobe Bryant chasing him is wearing Bryant out, writes CBSSports.com’s Larry Holder. That made it no surprise that Bryant ended Sunday’s game on crutches after rolling his ankle. All of this makes The Los Angeles Times’s T. J. Simers wonder what will happen when the Lakers play a good team.There are more interesting N.B.A. story lines, with the Heat’s loss to the 76ers resurfacing some of their nettlesome bad habits, writes Israel Gutierrez in The Miami Herald, and the Hawks suddenly looking menacing as they put Orlando on the ropes, writes Michael Wallace on ESPN.com. With the Celtics polishing off the Knicks, Ian Thomsen of SI.com turns to the question of how good they actually are. Ken Berger of CBSSports.com, however, believes the first-round victory was one of their trademark demolitions, something the Knicks could not come close to mustering as they let Rajon Rondo drive the lane at will, writes Adrian Wojnarowski on Yahoo.com.There are other sports going on that do not involve playoff panic, although admittedly it is difficult to get excited about Lee Westwood regaining the No. 1 world ranking in golf (please wake us when he wins something major). It is far easier to amuse yourself with Ian Poulter’s assertion that his rental house in Hilton Head, S.C., is haunted.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','“We had high hopes with the previous case,” Mr. Sadoon said. “The case got to a point where we thought it could succeed, but then everything failed and we gave up on the case.”As Mr. Sadoon spoke, cars bustled through the square, which is surrounded by a traffic circle that connects many of Baghdad’s main streets. Police officers blew whistles to direct drivers, who honked their horns loudly as they tried to make their way through the city’s unrelenting traffic.“They can open the case, but I think in the end there will be political pressure to close it again,” Mr. Sadoon said. “We have learned our lesson from what happened before with the case.”The Nisour Square shootings enraged Iraqis, setting off anti-American sentiment that eventually led the Iraqi government to subject all foreign contractors to the country’s laws.In 2008, the United States Justice Department indicted the guards on manslaughter charges based on sworn statements the guards had given to the State Department under the promise of immunity.One guard, who pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the others, said the guards had opened fire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers and that there had been no threat to the convoy.But in 2009, a federal judge in Washington threw the case out, saying that the Justice Department’s use of the statements the guards gave in exchange for immunity compromised their right to a fair trial.The dismissal once again enraged Iraqis, who believed that the United States had allowed the contractors to operate above the law. In a visit to Iraq, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded by saying that “a dismissal is not an acquittal,” and the Obama administration appealed the decision.Not surprisingly, all of the legal back and forth has left many victims confused.When news that the case had been reopened broke on Friday, there were no bulletins on television. Many victims first learned of the ruling from reporters, who called them for comment.Local newspapers, meanwhile, had no articles on the ruling until Sunday, and did not give them much prominence.Iraqi politicians, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, had harshly criticized the dismissal of the charges in 2009 but in this instance said little.“There are no reactions so far because the issue is still confusing to many Iraqis,” said Ali al-Moussawi, a top adviser to Mr. Maliki. “We are waiting to have something clear in this regard.”However, Mr. Moussawi said the government had confidence in the American judicial system. “We welcome this decision and consider it evidence of the fairness in U.S. judiciary,” he said.He added, “It’s the Iraqi government point of view that opening the case again will give the victims who died some justice.”Sami Hawas, 46, was driving with his mother and son in 2007 when they were stopped by the police at Nisour Square, which was under construction after it had been bombed earlier that year.The police, Mr. Hawas said, had stopped him because an American convoy was passing through.Several Blackwater sport utility vehicles traveling on the wrong side of the road came toward his car and began firing, Mr. Hawas said.“I got shot all over my body,” he said, including several wounds to his back and right leg. “I didn’t know where the bullets were coming from.”Mr. Hawas, a taxi driver, said he could no longer drive without pain from his injuries. “We don’t understand what is going on,” he said, referring to the case.He added: “I guess nothing will be changed because this is not the first case in which innocent people have been killed. And people’s lives are priceless. No one can compensate for those losses.”'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Children who spend more time in front of television and computer screens and less in outdoor physical activity have narrower blood vessels in their eyes, a new study has found.In adults, constricted blood vessels in the eyes have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.Scientists in Australia studied 1,492 6-year-olds randomly selected from 34 schools in Sydney. The children’s parents completed questionnaires asking how much time their children spent in physical activities and how much time they spent in front of a TV or computer. Then the researchers examined the children’s eyes.After adjusting for a variety of health factors, they found that blood vessels in the eyes of children who watched the most TV were slightly smaller in diameter than those in children who watched the least amount.The results for physical activity were similar: the eyes of children who exercised the least had the narrowest blood vessels. The reason is unclear.“We don’t know what it means in children,” said Dr. Paul Mitchell, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study. “We have to follow them for much longer.”'"

"'11-04-26,'1','There is truth, and an attempt at bluff, in Guardiola’s words. It is correct that Madrid’s spending $550 million on players over the last two years gives Coach José Mourinho depth that is unparalleled in the modern game. And it is a fact that injuries to Carles Puyol and Adriano, and the illness of Éric Abidal, sorely weaken Barcelona’s defense.But this is Barça we are talking about. This is the club of Xavi Hernández stroking the ball around in midfield, of Andrés Iniesta and Pedro and David Villa, all World Cup winners. And this is the team of Lionel Messi, whose tally of goals this season is at 50.Barcelona knows no other way than to control the ball and to attack.In winning, 6-3, at Valencia on Saturday with mainly second-string players, Real Madrid demonstrated that it does have another way of playing. It would, nevertheless, be a major surprise if Mourinho chose to turn his guns on Barcelona’s weakened defense.More likely, his tactic will be to squeeze the Barcelona free spirits, to deny them the ball, to hit them as physically hard as Real Madrid did in the teams’ two previous matches over the last 10 days. One caveat against that is that Madrid defender Ricardo Carvalho is suspended for the first leg, and four other players — Raúl Albiol, Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di María and Sergio Ramos — are a yellow card away from suspension from the second leg in Barcelona.Real Madrid has to control Barcelona, and at the same time control its own aggressiveness. The referee, to be named Tuesday, could play a decisive part.The other semifinal may be even more than people expect.“Schalke scored five goals away from home against last season’s European champion, Inter,” said Manchester United’s captain, Nemanja Vidic. “You have to respect that.”The German side, with the Champions League career record striker Raúl Gonzáles in its attack, defeated Inter home and away, 7-3, on aggregate in the quarterfinals. It also — even before a change of coach in March — knocked Bayern Munich out of the German Cup.So whatever the problems that caused Schalke to be inconsistent in the Bundesliga this season, its record in Cup matches must indeed be respected.Raúl is a phenomenon. He was released by Real Madrid as a spent force last summer, but at 33 he is a youngster compared with Manchester’s 37-year-old Ryan Giggs. They are chosen for the big games because they are still doing it. Raúl, through stealth and a predator’s instinct, is way ahead of all others with his Champions League record of 71 goals in 142 appearances.Giggs has passed every record at United, even Bobby Charlton’s number of games played, and, preparing for game number 872 since his debut in 1991, he still has the appetite for more.Raúl hasn’t changed a thing since he started. Giggs has matured from a sharp winger with an Olympian turn of pace into a calculating midfield provider for others. But, true sportsmen in the sense that all the stories about them are what they represent as players, Raúl and Giggs are still at the heart of things in the world’s top club tournament. So, too, is Edwin van der Sar. Well into his 40th year, older than the referee for Tuesday’s match, Carlos Velasco Carballo, van der Sar insists that this is his final season. United Manager Alex Ferguson will miss him, not just for his excellence in goal, but also his leadership.“You should have been in our dressing room at halftime on Saturday,” Ferguson said on television. “He was absolutely wonderful. The way he stood up and motivated the players was really good to listen to.”Experience is invaluable at this stage of the season, when games come thick and fast and titles are on the line. The youth and physical power that Schalke has can compensate for it, however, and Ferguson has a long memory of competing against German teams.“The German teams have always had a resilience and determination about them, and that will be exactly the same on Tuesday,” he said.Ferguson had one of his finest hours when United came from behind to beat Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final. Since then, his team has been put out by three German teams: Borussia Dortmund in 1997, Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 and, vengefully, Munich in 2010.Ferguson trusts that he has, this time, the right combination of youth and experience — and resilience — to get to the final. Against whom? All that anyone can be certain of at this stage is the opponent will be a Spanish team, and a good one.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','BANGKOK — Sharp rises in food prices are a threat to economic growth in Asia and could push millions of people into extreme poverty, the Asian Development Bank said in a report to be released on Tuesday.Food prices in Asia have increased an average of about 10 percent so far this year, which the bank calculates could force 64 million people below the poverty income threshold of $1.25 per person a day if prices remain at current levels.“Whenever we say that Asia’s growth rate is booming and Asia is a new global growth center, people misunderstand the point,” said Changyong Rhee, the chief economist of the bank, which is supported by governments and helps finance infrastructure projects around the region, among other activities. “Asia is home to two-thirds of the world’s poor. There is still a long way to go.”Asia is a major contributor to global inflation and is vulnerable to its effects. Growth in China and India is blamed for pushing up prices of many commodities. The region’s population density and uneven income distribution make people there especially susceptible to spikes in food prices, Mr. Rhee said. The poor in Asia typically spend about two-thirds of their income on food.A continued rise in prices for food and fuel could leave Asia’s consumers with less disposable income to spend on electronics, clothing and other products. Inflation could also spur central banks to further raise interest rates. Taken together, this could slow down economic growth by as much as 1.5 percentage points this year, the development bank has calculated.'"
"'11-04-26,'1','Most dog owners and veterinarians know that small dogs live longer than large ones, but until now there has been no thorough systematic examination of breed-related causes of death.Now, a group of researchers has reviewed more than 74,000 cases of canine death recorded from 1984 to 2004 in the Veterinary Medicine Database, a registry established by the National Cancer Institute that receives reports from 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America.The analysis, published in the March/April issue of The Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, found that the most common cause of death varies considerably from breed to breed and by age.Golden retrievers and boxers had the highest rates of cancer, the leading cause of canine death over all. In several toy breeds — Chihuahua, Pekingese, Pomeranians and toy poodles — cancer was much less common. For them, the leading cause of death was trauma.Diseases of the nervous system were the most common cause of death in older dogs, while gastrointestinal disease affected dogs of all ages equally. Death from diseases of the musculoskeletal system was common in larger breeds, but the big dogs suffered less from neurological and endocrine ailments.The authors acknowledge that the study is retrospective and subject to errors of classification of breed and disease. Still, a co-author, Kate E. Creevy, an assistant professor of veterinary internal medicine at the University of Georgia, said that knowing what kinds of diseases a breed is prone to is helpful. “We can use that information to avoid disease rather than treat it.”'"

"'11-04-27,'1','This spring, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will open its new $500 million, environmentally minded headquarters a few blocks from the Space Needle, which stands beside the Experience Music Project, Mr. Allen’s museum of rock ’n’ roll, an architectural power chord designed by Frank Gehry, not always perceived as being in tune.And just as Gates Foundation employees are about to move into their new offices, employees of another, newer high-tech giant, Amazon, have been moving into their sprawling new offices (1.7 million square feet) in buildings Mr. Allen built in the South Lake Union neighborhood.They join several organizations in the area that are involved in global health issues, including a cancer hospital, scientific researchers and educational groups. Some lease space from Mr. Allen’s firm, Vulcan Inc. The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, his philanthropy, has given money to some of the groups. So has the Gates Foundation, just blocks away.“Many of our grantees are located close to us, and they happen to be in property that Vulcan owns,” said Martha Choe, the chief administrative officer for the Gates Foundation. “It’s a small world.”In a brief phone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Allen said of the common ground: “It has nothing to do with deliberate planning on our parts. It just turned out to be great area of the city that’s really re-energized by the burgeoning biotech and other companies that moved into that area.”Mr. Gates has issued only one statement about Mr. Allen’s book since its release last week — “While my recollection of many of these events may differ from Paul’s, I value his friendship and the important contributions he made to the world of technology and at Microsoft” — and a spokesman said it was all Mr. Gates intended to say on the subject.For all the public fuss about “Idea Man,” many of the tense moments it describes happened before Mr. Allen left the company in 1983. People here often cast it as old news in a city where the conversation, and Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates, have mostly moved on.“We meet all the time and we talk about what’s going on with Microsoft and, to be honest, this hasn’t come up in our discussions,” said Mr. Sanfilippo, of Directions on Microsoft. “No one’s mentioned it.”Others, including some who receive money from the Gates Foundation and lease property from Vulcan, see no point in choosing sides.“He’s creating an environment where work can be done, where creativity can happen,” Ken Stuart, president of Seattle BioMed, an infectious disease research nonprofit, said of Mr. Allen. “That’s quite different from what Bill is doing. But they’re both doing things that complement each other.”Both billionaires grew up within the Seattle city limits, but neither lives here anymore. Mr. Allen lives on Mercer Island, just east of the city, and Mr. Gates lives one bridge farther away, in Medina. Microsoft is also a suburban endeavor, sprawling across the nearby city of Redmond. But Seattle remains central to both men.“That campus is a commitment to the city and to the Northwest,” Mr. Stuart said of the Gates Foundation.Mr. Stuart noted that he could see both the foundation and the Experience Music Project from his office window. “There’s an irony there,” he said. “Those two buildings look very different.”In his appearance last week, at Town Hall, Mr. Allen held his ground on his claims about Mr. Gates and Microsoft. Had he not told it like it was, he said, “I wouldn’t be doing justice to my own life.” But he also repeatedly praised Mr. Gates, as he does in the book, where he recounts how Mr. Gates visited him after he was hospitalized with cancer in 2009.He also noted that he signed the so-called billionaire’s pledge, to give at least half of his fortune to charity during his lifetime or upon his death, after Mr. Gates asked him to.Asked if he ever thought he and Mr. Gates would start another business together, though, Mr. Allen said, “It’s hard to go back to those halcyon days.”'"
"'11-04-27,'1','What if there are no exchange mergers? The Singapore-Australia deal already has been called off. Some Canadian authorities consider the Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX, awaiting approval of a deal with the London Stock Exchange, a strategic asset. Challenges still lie ahead for any NYSE Euronext deal, be it with Deutsche Börse or Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange. A worldwide veto would leave exchange bosses for whom the answer was consolidation struggling with the same tough questions.For starters, there’s size. A failure to merge would consign smaller bourses to the periphery. A standalone TMX, ASX in Australia or London bourse would have little if any scope to grow beyond its borders. And Singapore faces a difficult road winning business from rivals in Hong Kong and Shanghai.Then there’s cut-throat competition, especially in equities. Traditional exchanges have been losing market share to new trading venues for years. That reinforces the desire to get bigger. Even if scale doesn’t completely solve the problem, two or three years of earnings helped by merger-related savings can be appealing. It’s perhaps no coincidence that exchange combinations are back just as such benefits from earlier tie-ups are running out — and that the size of cost cuts is now central to the battle between NYSE Euronext’s two suitors.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, is making the contrarian call that United States equities will be a growth business. But if he and ICE’s Jeffrey Sprecher don’t manage to break up the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal, he will have no merger-related cost savings to fall back on and will therefore have to work harder to prove his point.NYSE and Deutsche Börse both have equities and derivatives operations in multiple countries even if they don’t get together. But the interlopers Nasdaq and ICE have mounted an effective campaign questioning the management and financial performance of the two would-be partners. The fallout, regardless of whether their deal is approved, could prove a distraction.'"
"'11-04-27,'1','“In Chinatown, people can come and shop for some really authentic goods, and we want them to really experience the neighborhood, not just come down and buy these fake knockoffs,” she said. “We want to be known for our museums, our shops, our restaurants.”Ms. Chin’s proposal was reported on Tuesday in The New York Post.People who want a designer handbag, Ms. Chin added, should consider buying the real thing.“What happened to the traditional value of saving up for something you really want that’s valuable?” she asked. “If you really like it, save money to buy the real thing.”Many of those interviewed in Chinatown on Tuesday, however, insisted that not everyone can afford the real thing, and that they should have the option of spending less for a purse that, at first glance, looks nearly indistinguishable from a bag with a designer label.“I think people should have the option to buy what’s in their budget,” said Sherise Jackson, 27, who lives in New Jersey. “I like fashion for an affordable price, and not everyone can afford $300 or $500 for a bag.”She fingered a scarf with Burberry’s trademarked tartan check pattern, and asked the price. “Ten dollars,” came the reply.Rick and Bev Houston, who were visiting from Toronto, poked their heads into a Canal Street store, asking about an imitation Michael Kors watch for their daughter.“It’s kind of a Catch-22,” Mr. Houston said, gesturing to the vendors around him as he explained his view of Ms. Chin’s proposal. “It’s illegal because it puts people out of work for the real thing, but how many people will be out of business if this passes?”Ms. Chin’s office said the counterfeit trademark industry cost the city $1 billion a year in tax revenue.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, when asked about the sale of fake designer merchandise, said it was something that he would take “very seriously.”“Protecting the trademark of manufacturers is in the city’s interest and the country’s interest, otherwise people wouldn’t come here and sell things and create things,” Mr. Bloomberg told reporters during an appearance in the Bronx. “Whether this is the right way to go about it, I don’t know.”He said it would mean another law that the police would have to enforce. “There’s a limited number of things we can do,” he said. “How practical it is, I don’t know.”Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, did not express an opinion about the proposal but said it would be considered once it was formally introduced.Chinatown shopkeepers were skittish about talking to a reporter — more were eager to try to sell a bargain “Louis Vuitton” for just $35 — but a man who identified himself only as Simon said he worried that the bill would hurt the district’s tourism trade.“They’re coming here for this,” he said, pointing to the seemingly endless line of storefronts filled with handbags. “The main attraction is this, here. A lot of people will lose jobs.”Meanwhile, just down the street, Dany Santiago, 28, of the Bronx, and some friends were busy scanning for deals.“If the economy is going down, why stop people from spending money?” asked Ms. Santiago, who said she disagreed with the bill’s premise.Her friend Rodney Reid, 30, called for an informed consumer and a laissez-faire approach.“If they know what they’re buying and they go into a store and realize it’s not an original Gucci or Prada,” he said, “they should have a right to buy what they want.”'"
"'11-04-27,'1','The Coca-Cola Company said Tuesday that its first-quarter net income climbed 18 percent as global sales of its sodas and juices grew.The company’s results, however, narrowly missed Wall Street’s expectations as it coped with effects of Japan’s earthquake, marketing expenses tied to its acquisition of a bottler and other unusual items.Net income rose to $1.9 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.61 billion, or 69 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items in the most recent period, the company earned 86 cents a share.Revenue increased 40 percent, to $10.52 billion, largely because of its acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprise’s North American bottling operations. But analysts had forecast earnings of 87 cents a share on revenue of $10.58 billion, according to data from FactSet.Coca-Cola sold 6 percent more of its products around the globe. The company has long relied on international business for growth while more established markets like the United States and Europe have slowed.But the company reported that its international and North American business grew during the quarter.In Japan, the company said all eight of its bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake were running again. Coca-Cola’s sales volume in Japan rose 1 percent for the period. Analysts say the total effect could take several quarters to assess.'"
"'11-04-27,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A NATO airstrike this month killed a senior operative of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan who was a regional commander in charge of suicide bombings and cash flow, the international military coalition said Tuesday.NATO identified the man killed in the air attack on April 13 in the Dangam District of eastern Kunar Province as Abu Hafs al-Najdi, also known as Abdul Ghani. The military alliance said the strike also killed a number of other insurgents, including a Qaeda leader known as Waqas.Mr. Najdi, a Saudi, directed Al Qaeda’s operations in Kunar Province and traveled regularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, NATO said. He coordinated suicide bombing attacks and kidnappings, and oversaw the transfer of money.An American official in Washington described Mr. Najdi as a “significant commander” and said that he had been one of fewer than a dozen such Qaeda commanders in Afghanistan.NATO said it had been chasing Mr. Najdi since 2007 and finally found him while he was meeting with Mr. Waqas, who like many Afghans used only one name.In Paktia Province, the provincial governor narrowly escaped what appeared to be an assassination attempt. A roadside bomb exploded behind a vehicle that was taking the governor, Juma Khan Hamdard, to his office, said Rohallah Samon, a spokesman for the governor.'"
"'11-04-27,'1','Mr. Paul remains, by choice, at the fringes of the Republican Party’s ideology, issuing critiques of the Federal Reserve (he calls the central bankers “counterfeiters”) and voting against most legislation that in his view increases the size of the federal government.He tends to pay little attention to standard political conventions. He is fiercely antiwar at a time when Republicans have typically expressed staunch support for the military efforts overseas. He calls for deep and painful sacrifices by important political constituencies.Surveys suggest that Mr. Paul’s support remains low. In most recent polls, Mr. Paul receives just over 5 percent of the support from potential Republican voters. That is similar to the level of support he received in contests four years ago, when he served mostly as a foil for discussion during the debates.Mr. Grayson, who lost a bid for the Republican Senate nomination in Kentucky to Mr. Paul’s son Rand, said he did not believe that Mr. Paul would win the nomination. But he said the Tea Party energy “is going to be very helpful, especially in a caucus state like Iowa, where it doesn’t take many votes” to win.In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Paul’s message of fiscal discipline, harsh spending cuts and dire warnings about the deficit seemed out of sync with the relative affluence through most of 2007. Now, the debate consuming Washington is about the issues that Mr. Paul cares about: the debt, the deficit and the consequences of failing to shrink the size of government.Drew Ivers, a member of the state central committee of Iowa’s Republican Party and the chairman of Mr. Paul’s Iowa leadership team, is convinced that this year could be different.“Ron Paul finds himself right in the epicenter of the three or four or five of the most critical and controversial issues in our nation today. The spending. The war. The financial crisis,” Mr. Ivers said in an interview Tuesday. “That’s how snowballs develop, you know. They start small, and they get bigger as they roll downhill.”During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Paul proved to be a better-than-expected fund-raiser, but he did it late in the game. In December 2007, just days before the Iowa caucus, Mr. Paul raised $6 million in a one-day “money bomb” that was timed to coincide with the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. This year, Mr. Paul would most likely tap into his donor base much earlier, giving him the opportunity to advertise on television throughout the primary season.He could also be helped by less competition for donor dollars than in 2007, when he was competing against a field of a dozen Republican candidates, including several with deep pockets or a proven ability to raise millions.Mr. Paul also won’t have to spend so much time in this campaign explaining who he is and what he believes. When he started his bid for the Republican nomination in January 2007, he was a little-known member of Congress. A Washington Post poll in February 2007 put him at just 1 percent, if the vote were conducted then. Four years later, Mr. Paul’s poll numbers remain low, but his participation in the 2008 debates and his frequent appearances on television have kept him in the news.'"

Along with Aeros, Toffee Crisp Clusters and Minstrels, there are M & M’s, Snickers and Twix. What’s so Brit about those? But Jigs Patel, who opened the store about two weeks ago, said that those candies with the familiar names are made for the English and European market. The sweetener is cane sugar, not corn syrup, making them taste a tad less sweet, as a comparison of domestic and imported M & M’s showed.'"
"'11-04-27,'1','After being sent e-mails detailing the allegations in the legal papers, Mr. Zakarian replied by e-mail: “As a respectful practice, I will not comment on business partnerships or pending litigations. I realize and understand the responsibility that as a public face of a business, one can become a target. I remain focused on my craft and delivering great meals to my diners.”The bankruptcy filing, which lists assets of no more than $50,000 and liabilities of up to $1 million, automatically puts a hold on any litigation against Mr. Zakarian, including the class action lawsuit, said Scott A. Lucas, the plaintiffs’ lawyer.“Isn’t it interesting that a TV celebrity chef, who opens multiple new restaurants around the country, can file for bankruptcy?” said Mr. Lucas, who said he would move to have the class action go forward.Since Country closed in 2008, Mr. Zakarian has opened the Lambs Club restaurant in the Chatwal Hotel off Times Square and the National Bar and Dining Rooms in the Benjamin Hotel in Midtown. He oversees food and beverages at the Water Club at Borgata in Atlantic City and will soon open the Tudor House restaurant in the Chatwal group’s Dream South Beach Hotel in Miami Beach. He rents a four-bedroom house in Greenwich, Conn., that is listed on the market for just under $3 million.Chefs and restaurateurs have faced lawsuits over pay issues like overtime and distribution of tips with increasing regularity in New York, although bankruptcy does not seem to be the usual outcome.What is striking about the suit involving Country is that a former partner in the restaurant, Adam Block, has filed an affidavit in support of the workers, and that another partner, Moshe Lax, has said in a separate suit that Mr. Zakarian violated labor laws.The two men agreed to a $200,000 settlement with the cooks in December. But Mr. Block, a restaurant developer who helped bring Per Se and Masa to the Center, said in a legal filing on behalf of the plaintiffs last November that the settlement was not the reason he was speaking against his former partner. It was, he said, “because I know that Geoffrey Zakarian’s narcissistic behavior and arrogance caused Country to fail and inevitably allowed whatever wage and hour violations occurred while he was Country’s operator.”The workers say in their lawsuit that they were underpaid in a variety of ways. The suit says that when one worker asked when he would get the overtime pay, Mr. Zakarian’s response was, “Go peel some .”The chief plaintiff, Prince Breland, said in legal papers that line cooks like himself were generally short-changed on lunch and dinner duty by two to three hours a shift. After Country started paying by the hour, he said, when he worked long shifts he would get $7.50 an hour rather than the $12 an hour he was due. (Mr. Breland, a 44-year-old resident who has worked in restaurants and catering for years, said in an interview that even when he became a salaried sous-chef at Country, he earned no more than $33,000 a year.)He said he told Country’s bookkeeper: “ ‘You’re ripping everyone off with the hours. You’ll feel better if you just quit.’ ” He said the bookkeeper began crying and said, “They’re making me do this all the time.”Mr. Breland also said in the suit that in Country’s first year or so, the restaurant was so busy that “lunch and dinner shift cooks had to stuff food (usually a piece of bread or a leftover scrap of food) in their mouths while standing.” Nevertheless, he said, $2 a day was deducted from the cooks’ pay for staff meals.The end came for Country in the summer of 2008, sooner than might have been expected considering that it won three stars from in The New York Times in April 2006. The closing seems to have stirred up more animosity in what was already a rocky relationship between Mr. Zakarian and his two main partners, Mr. Block and Mr. Lax. Their partnership was dissolved in April 2008, with an agreement that called for Mr. Zakarian to be paid $380,000 and for him to leave soon after that.But on July 3 of that year, the workers filed suit. And two weeks later the city health department shut down Country for several days, largely because of problems with procedures that the department had brought to Mr. Zakarian’s attention more than two years earlier.These difficulties do not seem to have sat well with Mr. Lax, who had guaranteed the $380,000. He apparently did not make scheduled payments and in March of last year, Mr. Zakarian sued him for the sum. Last month, Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich in State Supreme Court in ruled that Mr. Zakarian must be paid.But by then Mr. Lax had filed his own suit against Mr. Zakarian seeking more than $2 million in damages, charging “breaches of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of funds.” Because Mr. Zakarian had “ignored applicable labor laws,” the suit says, Mr. Lax “was dragged through the proverbial mud in the class action.”Country grossed about $9 million a year at its best, but never made a profit, according to the lawsuit, which said that Mr. Zakarian received a management fee of 4 percent off the top, and paid his wife a $70,000 salary for marketing services. The suit also accuses Mr. Zakarian of failing to make payments for rent and sales . (There is a $51,318.40 state tax warrant against Country on sales from Sept. 1, 2005, to Aug. 31, 2008.)Mr. Zakarian, in a legal response to Mr. Lax’s lawsuit, said he committed no wrongdoing, was paid what he was owed and was not legally responsible for some of the problems cited in the case.Mr. Lax’s accusations were amplified by Mr. Block. In his declaration in support of the workers’ lawsuit, Mr. Block said Mr. Zakarian gave away about 10 percent of the restaurant’s revenue in free meals to friends, family and associates. “I also learned that Mr. Zakarian was dining out at other restaurants on the Company’s credit card,” Mr. Block said, “and had reimbursed himself monthly for thousands of dollars in expenses unrelated to Country.”Within months after Country opened, Mr. Block said, “I had come to realize that Geoffrey Zakarian was using Country as something of a personal fiefdom.”'"
"'11-04-27,'1','BRUSSELS — Almost a year after it adopted sweeping austerity measures as a condition of an international rescue package, Greece has failed to get a grip on its public finances, according to new data released on Tuesday, increasing fears that the country may have to restructure its mountain of debt.Greece’s deficit was 10.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2010, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. The deficit exceeded the 9.6 percent target set last fall by the government and the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm. Public debt swelled to 142.8 percent of G.D.P., Eurostat said.Some critics will see these figures as a vindication of the argument that austerity measures — imposed as part of the 110 billion euro, or $160 billion, bailout last May by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund — are stifling the growth that Greece needs to put its finances back in order.The Finance Ministry said Tuesday that Greece failed to meet its targets because “the impact of the recession on G.D.P. in 2010 was larger than anticipated” as was the deterioration in tax receipts and a reduction in social security contributions because of high unemployment.It said the government remained committed to achieving its goal of reducing the deficit by 2014 to below 3 percent of G.D.P., the ceiling for euro zone membership.'"
"'11-04-27,'1','Another devastating recession, perhaps? Potential buyers scorning en masse the notion of ownership? Mr. Blitzer does not see those happening.This will be small comfort for anyone trying to sell in this environment, or merely wondering where the money for retirement will come from. Washington was the only Case-Shiller city where prices went up over the last year. But even it dropped slightly in February. Ten of the cities in the index, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, New York and Seattle, hit a low for the cycle during the month. That was one fewer than January.Detroit was the exception. Why Detroit, by far the worst housing market in the country, rose when everywhere else was sliding is a statistical mystery.For the 20 cities, prices are down 3.3 percent in the last 12 months. That is not much compared to the precipitous drops of 2008 and 2009 but some see the declines accelerating.Capital Economics, a forecasting group in Toronto, previously said prices would drop about 5 percent this year. “That forecast is looking increasingly realistic,” Paul Dales, a senior United States economist, wrote in a note to clients.Another 5 percent decline in the index would take it back to about 133. While that equates to a 33 percent gain for homeowners since 2000, it is just about nothing after inflation is factored in. And those would be the lucky ones, who bought long ago.Most economists think the market is in transition to something resembling stability, although few expect genuine price increases anytime soon.“Things are moving in the direction of getting better,” said Eric Fox, vice president for statistical and economic modeling for the consultant Veros.Among the helpful trends: The oversupply of houses that characterized the early stages of the downturn is gradually being absorbed, the employment situation is marginally better and interest rates are not increasing.Veros is forecasting that stronger markets, including Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Shreveport, La., will increase 2 to 3 percent over the next year, while the weakest markets will fall about 5 percent. Weak markets include Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Portland, Ore.“Foreclosures are the big unknown,” Mr. Fox said. “If there is a huge influx, that can have an effect.”The Case-Shiller index, which measures repeat sales of houses, is an imperfect measure of the real estate market. The index is a three-month moving average, so the February results include December and January.Other indexes also describe a troubled market, however. The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s index, which is calculated using the purchase prices of houses with mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government loan repositories, is declining at a faster rate than previously.The F.H.F.A. index fell 1.6 percent in February from the previous month, the agency said last week, while the January decline was revised up to 1 percent. In the last year, the index has fallen nearly 6 percent.If some troubled owners are beginning to reject the notion of homeownership, a few renters are sensing this might be their moment.“Talking about how the recession is bad for home builders and sellers ignores an entire segment of the country for whom this is a blessing,” said Abby Eagye, 41.A writer, skiing instructor and emergency medical worker, Ms. Eagye lives in Aspen, Colo., where the wealthy roam. But the crash has yielded some surprising deals. Ms. Eagye is pulling together a down payment.“I missed the real estate window once and I don’t care to do it again,” she said. “I have no false dreams of flipping homes to make money. I just want the safety of owning my own home.”'"

"'11-04-28,'1','“I’m here to continue to run this club,” McCourt said, “and I think it is wrong — fundamentally wrong — for any one person to stand in the way of a sound business transaction, which I and my organization have every right to enter into.” He said that the money from the deal would stabilize the Dodgers for two decades but that even now, his team is in compliance with all of baseball’s financial rules.Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball who attended the meeting with McCourt, said McCourt’s characterization of it was flawed.“Most fundamentally, Commissioner Selig did not ‘veto’ a proposed transaction,” Manfred said. “Rather, Mr. McCourt was clearly told that the commissioner would make no decision until after the investigation into the club and its finances is complete so that he can properly evaluate all the facts and circumstances.”Manfred added that “there is no seizure of the Los Angeles Dodgers” and that Schieffer’s duties as the team’s monitor were provided to McCourt in writing.Still, McCourt described Schieffer as a “receiver” assigned to execute a “predetermined result” — an indication that he believes it is being prepared for a sale. He said the investigation into the Dodgers “is not a genuine one,” but is designed to “interfere with our ability to close this transaction.”Rather than seek a loan from baseball — Selig approved a $25 million loan to the Mets in November — McCourt said he had sought approval for the Fox deal. He said it was “not appropriate for one person’s property to be seized by someone else just because he got divorced or for some arbitrary reason.”At about the same time that McCourt was expressing his strong disagreement with Selig’s actions, Schieffer was holding his own news conference in Los Angeles. Schieffer, a former ambassador to Japan and Australia, had a conciliatory tone.“The commissioner has the right, under the agreements that we have and in the best interests of baseball, to take control of a franchise when there is difficulty,” he said, according to The Los Angeles Times. “I think that’s what the commissioner has done, and I am his representative.”Schieffer said he expected to meet with McCourt when he returns to Los Angeles, and if they clash, “that’s really his choice.”McCourt said that Schieffer’s appointment had created chaos because “there’s been no due process whatsoever and somebody has been called a monitor who is a receiver with control of my business.”McCourt said he had not been told that he cannot enter Dodgers offices, but he was clearly uncertain what his role will be. When asked what he will do when he returns to Dodger Stadium, he said: “What are they going to do? It’s a good question.” He said he had enough money to pay his players’ salaries, but “I’m not going to put more money into a team I don’t run.”'"
"'11-04-28,'1','Connecticut, with its patchwork of poor cities and wealthy suburbs, has the largest achievement gap between black and white students of any state in the country. With economic distress widening and school budgets tightening, many districts are increasingly focused on making sure that enrolled students belong in the district.“I’d do the same thing, we all would,” Gwen Samuel, founder of Connecticut Parents Union, an education advocacy group, said of Ms. McDowell’s actions. Ms. Samuels was among several supporters, including local N.A.A.C.P. officials, who turned out on Wednesday as Ms. McDowell made her first court appearance.Ms. McDowell, 33, was arrested April 14 on felony charges of committing and attempting to commit first-degree larceny by using her baby sitter’s address to enroll her son in a Norwalk school in the fall. She could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, if convicted, and could be ordered to pay more than $15,000 in restitution, roughly the cost of a year’s tuition in Norwalk schools.“They went from zero to 90,” Ms. Samuel said, “without ever thinking about what they were doing to the child.”The police began investigating Ms. McDowell after they were contacted by a lawyer for the Norwalk Housing Authority, which was in the process of evicting her baby sitter, Ana Marquez. Ms. Marquez was found to be in violation of her lease agreement, because Ms. McDowell had listed the apartment as her primary address so her son could go to Brookside Elementary School, where he attended kindergarten from September to Jan. 19.Beyond that, much of Ms. McDowell’s story remains in dispute.She said she received a call from the school district in January telling her to remove her child from the school. The district says that no such call was made and that she withdrew him on her own. Under federal law, Ms. McDowell would have been allowed to keep her child at Brookside had she been homeless, but officials said that she never claimed to be homeless and that they were unaware of any evidence that she was homeless while he was enrolled.Ms. McDowell says she is now living out of a van while her son stays with relatives in Bridgeport.Her lawyer and N.A.A.C.P. officials said Wednesday that she was subjected to a body-cavity search when she was arrested. Norwalk’s police chief, Harry W. Rilling, said that he had reviewed a videotape and that no strip-search had taken place. He said he was still awaiting permission from Ms. McDowell’s lawyer to release the tape as proof.The chief said the charges against Ms. McDowell did not merit the attention they had received; he provided news articles of several other cases, including three in Connecticut, in which parents faced similar charges of fraud and larceny.Aside from this case, Ms. McDowell has three other charges pending, including two serious felony charges related to a Nov. 9 arrest. The police said she was found to be in possession of 60 bags of marijuana and had 14 bags of crack cocaine stashed under a black wig she was wearing.Her lawyer, Darnell Crosland, said her pending charges had no relevance to this case. And school officials and advocates said that whatever her personal circumstances, they did not obscure the broader disparities in Connecticut and elsewhere that led some parents to stretch the rules in the interest of their children’s education.“Whatever the facts of this case, the challenge in the state of Connecticut and beyond is providing a quality education for all children,” said Bruce Morris, director of human relations for the Norwalk schools. “The failure of school systems to provide that is the larger issue that goes well beyond whatever happened in this case.”'"
"'11-04-28,'1','BEIRUT, Lebanon — In the besieged city of Dara’a, which has become a symbol of Syria ’s uprising, residents on Wednesday told of shortages of bread and even baby formula. Some stick a pole wrapped in a scarf out the door to see whether snipers are lurking. Doctors in a mosque have resorted to using sewing needles to stitch wounds, amid shortages of bandages and disinfectant.Some spoke of moments of camaraderie in the three-day blockade, as Palestinians from nearby refugee camps ferried canned food and bread by foot to Dara’a, a poor border town in a drought-stricken region where protests last month galvanized nationwide demonstrations. Others spoke of a deepening fear of snipers by day, raids by night and people so scared they would not open their doors, even to neighbors.“Dara’a and its hinterland are a ghost town,” one resident of the area said as he fled across the border to Jordan on Wednesday. “You can’t go in and you can’t go out.”As the crackdown in Dara’a entered its fourth day on Thursday, opposition activists reported a growing number of resignations from the Baath Party, which has ruled Syria in some fashion since 1963. Though the figures did not occupy senior positions, activists said the resignations were symbolically important, signaling the willingness of people to defy the inevitable repercussions and forego the privileges that membership secured.Wissam Tarif, executive director of Insan, a human rights group, said 203 people had resigned from the party in the region around Dara’a, 64 in restive towns on the outskirts of the capital Damascus and 30 in Baniyas, a town on the Mediterranean coast.“They’re not necessarily big-shot politicians, but they are loyal to the regime and they had influence within the party,” he said. “It’s a sign. It’s a kind of response.”Dara’a has become the center stage of an uprising that has posed the greatest challenge to the Assad family’s four decades of rule. While other towns reel from a cycle of protests and funerals for the fallen that turn into more protests, Dara’a is the town the government has sought, through force of arms since Monday, to pummel back into loyalty. For weeks a symbol of people’s anger at arbitrary power, it has now become a test of whether the protests will weather a crackdown in full swing.In the end, this town may determine whether the government — staggering but still entrenched, playing on fears of chaos in a county still deeply divided by its sects and ethnicities — can reinstill the fear that the protests broke.“The regime may be able to stop the uprising in two or three weeks with a crackdown,” said Alaa Hourani, a Dara’a resident, “but they cannot finish it forever.”Almost no foreign journalists are allowed in Syria, much less Dara’a, and an authoritative account of conditions in the town of 75,000 is impossible.In past days, it has become a caldron of rumors and conflicting sentiments. Over the phone on Wednesday, a man shouted that 150 soldiers had defected to the opposition, but even some human rights activists remained skeptical of decisive splits in the military. Some residents denounced President Bashar al-Assad, while those fleeing across the border said that he still enjoyed their support and that anger was more pronounced against his family — his brother Maher, who leads the Fourth Armored Division, deployed in Dara’a, and his brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, an intelligence chief and deputy chief of staff.“These are Maher’s people,” said the resident fleeing to Jordan. “They’re barbaric. Nobody can control them except Maher, and Bashar cannot control Maher.”Across Syria, the siege of Dara’a has become a rallying cry, demonstrating its resonance to an uprising still in search of leadership and coherence.“ ‘The people of Dara’a are free!’ ” an activist abroad quoted dissidents shouting during protests in towns on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus. “ ‘Bashar, get out of Dara’a!’ ” others cried, the activist said.The protests erupted in Dara’a in March after 15 students were arrested for writing antigovernment graffiti on school walls. “The people want to topple the regime,” the slogans said, in an echo of the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Security in the town was run by Atef Najib, a relative of Mr. Assad, and, by most accounts, the youths were tortured.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','New Jersey is second only to in capacity thanks to financial incentives and a public policy commitment to renewable energy industries seeded during Gov. ’s administration. But what might have been a point of pride in a state better known as the nation’s leader in toxic sites has instead caused suburban aesthetic unrest.Some residents consider the overhanging panels “ugly” and “hideous” and worry aloud about the effect on property values.Though nearly halfway finished, the company’s crews have encountered some fresh resistance in Bergen County, where cities, villages and boroughs are in varying stages of mortification. Local officials have forced a temporary halt in many towns as they seek assurances that they will not be liable in case of injury, but also to buy time for suggesting alternative sites — like dumps — to spare their tree-lined streets.And here in Oradell, at least one panel has gone missing.When and where the panels will show up next can be a mystery, prompting complaints over the lack of prior notice.“I came back from running errands and there they were,” Mrs. Olsen, 37, said. “It’s not right. They should have warned us.”In neighboring Ridgewood, Deputy Mayor Thomas M. Riche said constituents had called, sent e-mails and stopped him on the street demanding that he halt the encroaching blight. Ridgewood, an affluent village of about 24,000, got PSE&G to cease installations after only a few had been put up, over concerns that they would interfere with the emergency communications boxes on the poles.The talks are continuing, Mr. Riche said, adding that he is trying to steer the Ridgewood panels to a town park-and-ride lot and its public schools.“A cluster of panels in one area is better than individual panels all over the town,” he said. “We’re not against solar energy, but there are more efficient ways than having panels on the utility poles.”PSE&G officials said their search for maximum sun exposure could not dodge and weave residential areas in a place as crowded as New Jersey. It turns out that only a quarter of the company’s 800,000 poles are suitable for the panels, which are mounted 15 feet high and need good southern exposure.Solar industry experts approve of the decentralized pole-by-pole approach and said it could be just as efficient and cost effective as larger installations.“Solar is extremely flexible,” said Monique Hanis, a spokeswoman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group based in . “The utility owns the property already, and the panels can feed right into the transmission line.”Ralph A. LaRossa, PSE&G’s president and chief executive, said that the company was also placing panels, which direct the energy they generate back into the power grid, at its industrial yards and on facility rooftops, and that it was leasing flat roofs of large buildings, including several schools in Newark. “We’re looking for ways to deploy the technology in the cheapest and most accessible way,” he said.Yes, Mr. LaRossa said, his company could have communicated better, but he added that Bergen County had become “a pocket” of opposition in what had generally been a welcoming reception.And not every burg in Bergen County is rebelling. Over in Fair Lawn, Mayor Lisa Swain said that her city had not interfered with the program and that she was trying to make the community sustainable in other ways, like using motion sensor lighting in city buildings.“I’m going to do what I can,” she said.Sean Smith, a 43-year-old airline sales supervisor in Fair Lawn, said he was fine with the seven panels on his street, especially “if it’s helping the greenhouse effect.”“We have the kids to think about,” he said.But his neighbor Tony Christofi, a 47-year-old contractor, wondered aloud whether Fair Lawn, by not fighting, was getting more than its fair share.“I’m fine with green energy,” he said, “but are the savings going to be passed on to consumers?”PSE&G officials said solar energy was still more expensive to produce than more traditional power sources and acknowledged that bills were going up 29 cents a month. One panel will  produce enough kilowatt hours in one year to light four 60-watt bulbs around the clock for around six weeks, the company said.When complete, the panels on the poles are expected to provide half of the 80 megawatts of electricity generated by the utility's overall $515 million solar investment — enough to power 6,500 homes.Although he supports renewable energy, Gov. , through a spokesman, characterized the mandates that spawned the panel project as “extremely aggressive.” He has already asked that they be re-evaluated.Over in Oradell, population 8,000, some residents say the new units aren’t worth the effort, producing too little power for the aggravation.The case of the missing panel has been referred to local law enforcement.“PSE&G takes a very dim view of people tampering with the equipment,” said Francis Sullivan, a company spokesman, “but that’s secondary to the fact that it’s just a dangerous idea.” All the units are connected to high-voltage wires.Richard Joel Sr., a lawyer in town, said a panel close to his house had been removed, but demurred when asked if he knew details.“I’m not saying what happened,” he said.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','“We love all our boroughs,” Ms. Karp said. “The Council is going by acreage; the parks department is going by special permits and population.”Liam Kavanagh, the first deputy commissioner for the department, said that last year 45 percent of all special-event permits the department issued were for Manhattan.“Consider Central Park,” Mr. Kavanagh said. “This is the busiest park in the city, with well over 35 million visitors each year.”Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, whose Queens district includes Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the United States Open tennis tournament is held, said her borough seemed to see officers only when it was hosting a big tourism event.“It seems that when I visit my park and the U.S. Open is in town, we have lots of security; we have everything that we need to make that park safe,” Ms. Ferreras said. “The week, the minute, the second that that tournament is over, the park is abandoned. And it just seems to me that when the money comes into town, we have the resources. When the money leaves town, the resources go with it, and it’s just frustrating for me.”“I just feel that as an outer borough, we always get the short end of the stick,” Ms. Ferreras added.After learning that at times the Flushing Meadows park may have only two officers assigned to it, Ms. Ferreras said, incredulously, “Two officers?”“Two officers is not enough,” she added. “Two officers is never enough; two officers is probably not enough for some of my playgrounds in my district.”The hearing also addressed some of the issues the officers face, and many showed up to watch and to testify.Robert Simon, a sergeant assigned to Staten Island, said officers needed more support to do their jobs.“When I started with the department, there were 15 officers assigned to my borough,” Mr. Simon said in written testimony. “Those numbers now dwindle down to six. Yet at the same time, the workload increases, assignments, deployments of officers to other boroughs or contract parks continue making the mission of preserving and protecting our city parks harder and more difficult on ourselves and the citizens of this great city.”Omar Malcolm, an officer in Queens, also testified, reading notes from his BlackBerry in a style that sometimes verged on the lyrical. “To only say we are just eyes and ears is absurd,” he said, rattling off some of the arrests that officers had made or had helped with. “We feel the community, and the community feels us,” he added.When Mr. Malcolm finished, the room erupted in applause, and he walked out to high-fives.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','As persistently high unemployment has drained the funds that are used to pay jobless benefits, more than two-thirds of the states expect to raise taxes on businesses this year to replenish them, according to a survey of labor agencies released Wednesday.Unemployment taxes remain low by historical standards: the survey, by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, found that states have effectively cut the unemployment tax rate on businesses by 64 percent since the unemployment program began collecting taxes from employers in 1938.The stubbornly high unemployment that has upended the lives of millions of Americans has also depleted the unemployment trust funds of most states: 32 of them owe the federal government more than $48.3 billion that they borrowed to continue paying jobless benefits.Unless Congress acts, that money will have to be repaid — with interest. The survey found that seven states were thinking about borrowing from the private sector to repay the loans.Some analysts say that states kept unemployment taxes too low during boom years, so their trust funds were ill-prepared to weather the downturn. Now states find themselves forced to raise taxes on employers just as they need them to create jobs, and to consider cutting benefits while huge numbers of people are relying on them to survive.Richard A. Hobbie, the executive director of the association of work force agencies, said the survey found that states would collect an average of 16.5 percent more in unemployment insurance taxes this year than they did last year.The survey did not measure reductions to benefits. Michigan recently decided to pay only 20 weeks of jobless benefits, down from the 26 weeks that most states pay, and other states are following its lead. (The federal government pays for extended benefits after the state benefits run out.) Other states are capping or reducing the amount of money they pay in benefits.'"

"'11-04-28,'1','Mr. Obama’s complaint that the controversy threatened to distract politicians from the country’s big problems produced a hall-of-mirrors-like reverberation from his Republican adversaries, some of whom had raised doubts about his birthplace but now accused the president of releasing the documents to distract from the country’s big problems.Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement: “The president ought to spend his time getting serious about repairing our economy, working with Republicans and focusing on the long-term sustainability of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Unfortunately his campaign politics and talk about birth certificates is distracting him from our No. 1 priority — our economy.”Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and a potential 2012 rival, said in a Twitter message that the news media should not “let the WH distract you w/the birth crt” from stories like the public comments of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve bank.False accusations about Mr. Obama’s being born abroad — and the implication that his election was thus invalid — have percolated on the Internet and among conspiracy theorists since the early days of his presidential campaign, when aides distributed a shorter version of the birth certificate that is normally given out by officials in Hawaii.But White House officials concluded about a month ago that the falsehoods had moved from “the nether regions of the Internet” into the mainstream political arena, thanks in large part to the efforts of Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and reality television host who has used the issue as a media magnet.A New York Times survey taken two weeks ago found that nearly 25 percent of Americans believed Mr. Obama was born in another country; 45 percent of Republicans said they believed that.Some Democratic activists crowed Wednesday that Mr. Obama had slyly offered a contrast between the president and his likely Republican challengers. Markos Moulitsas, a liberal blogger, wrote, “What better way to show how out of touch and irrational Republicans are than to rub this in their face?”But White House aides turned back that suggestion, saying it would have been more politically savvy to let the Republicans continue to question his birth certificate since the conservatives most interested in that issue are unlikely to vote for Mr. Obama anyway.The birth certificate, which is posted on the White House Web site, shows that Mr. Obama was born in Honolulu and is signed by state officials and his mother. It is more detailed than the one officials presented during the 2008 campaign, showing the name of the hospital where Mr. Obama was born and including the signature of the attending physician.Hawaii does not normally release the long-form certificate, but did so in response to a request for a waiver of state policy by Mr. Obama and his lawyers.In a news conference Wednesday morning that produced split-screen images on cable television networks, Mr. Trump claimed credit for forcing Mr. Obama’s hand, saying, “I feel I’ve accomplished something really, really important.” But he said the document would have to be examined for authenticity.“We have to look at it. A lot of people have to look at it,” he said. “I hope it’s true, and the reason I hope it’s true is because we have real problems in this country.”Chatter on Internet forums suggested that hard-core conspiracy buffs were unlikely to be convinced by the White House disclosure. Several postings suggested that the document might be a forgery; others sought to shift the topic to questions about Mr. Obama’s adoption by his stepfather.White House officials said they hoped to at least bring an end to discussion of the topic in the mainstream news.“I know that there’s going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest,” Mr. Obama said. “But I’m speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness.”Mr. Obama, at a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York on Wednesday night, made light of the issue. ""My name is Barack Obama, I was born in Hawaii, I’m president of the United States, and I’m running for re-election,"" he said, grinning. The Democratic Party faithful cheered.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','During in February, Thakoon Panichgul had to go on to deny that his tiny Yorkie, named , snapped at interns.And when died last month, obituaries made gleeful mention of her canine cohort, in particular one that treated the floors of friends as fire hydrants.Bad dogs can bring bad publicity, as Carl Paladino learned when his pit bull attacked another dog on the campaign trail for governor in New York last year.They can be real estate deal-breakers, too, barking and growling at potential buyers. “If you’re not a dog lover, it can be very off-putting,” said Robert Browne, a senior vice president at Corcoran, who recently showed a $3 million home in Greenwich Village with a nasty Rottweiler running loose.Dogs in . Dogs in classes. Dogs in wedding parties. They have even invaded luxury boutiques. At the offices of Marchesa, the delicate gown line designed by Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig, office dogs are known to get into savage fights. “Sometimes it’s funny, but other times it can get pretty violent,” said Edward Chapman, the company’s president, whose Yorkshire terrier, Lottie, is often the instigator.Are these dogs getting an unleashed sense of entitlement from their owners? Yes, said David Reinecker, a Beverly Hills dog trainer whose clients include , and . “The elite are extreme personalities,” he said. “Some come home from a day at the office of controlling armies of frightened people and then let their dogs rule their lives. On top of that, the mega-rich and powerful can be very insecure.”That might have explained Trouble, the Maltese that belonged to . It was known to attack the harried staff. “Leona wanted everybody to love her, but she knew nobody loved her,” a housekeeper of Ms. Helmsley was quoted as saying in The Daily News in 2007, when it was learned the dog was to inherit $12 million. “This dog replaced that love.” That may explain why both seemed so neurotic.But then, the life of cosseted canines can be harder than it appears. Snooty co-ops have etiquette rules about barking and dog-on-dog interactions in lobbies and elevators. Some buildings even require that dogs be carried on elevators and in lobbies. (Carrying dogs, according to experts, makes them more neurotic because they are happier on their feet, just as any person other than Liz Taylor in “ ” might be.)In addition, second and third homes in or , , can be disorienting for older dogs that don’t like learning new tricks, like finding the urine pad in a new mansion or not attacking the strangers who trim the privet.A big domestic staff can make obedience confusing, too. At cocktail parties, canapés are a temptation, as are mink coats draped on couches and expensive shoes that look like toys.Then there are the women who use dogs as security blankets and take them to red carpet events like arm candy. ’s Tinkerbell was known to snap and bite. “Little dogs sense their owners’ fear of strangers and paparazzi, so they growl and snap at them,” said Mr. Reinecker, who as a trainer has found that there’s a bull market in bad dogs right now.Making matters worse, he said, is the fact that owners don’t discipline the dogs themselves. Instead, they throw money at them, expecting a specialist to fix the problem.“The rich are less hands-on,” said Pat McGregor, the founder of Dog Training in New York, who said that she has worked with the difficult dogs of , and Blaine Trump. “You can’t blame an animal for not behaving like a person. But just like us, every dog has its own issues because there are no perfect dogs.”And there are no perfect owners, even when they are as gracious and unassuming as Ellen Crown, a youthful Upper East Side mother of three children and three dogs. Her problem pooch was Kiwi, a terror of a Yorkshire terrier. “Kiwi bit people on the street all the time, and I’d be mortified,” Ms. Crown said. “My mother-in-law got bit once.”Kiwi also ruined expensive rugs on a regular basis. “My poor stepfather is the owner of ABC Carpet,” said Ms. Crown, who is married to Daniel Crown, a lawyer whose family also runs the Little Nell hotel in and helped found the Aspen Institute. “He told me that I’m the most expensive stepdaughter he could possibly imagine.”In addition, having a biting dog around with her youngest and his little friends (and potentially litigious parents) was a minefield. So after several failed attempts with trainers, Kiwi was given away. But not long after, Ms. Crown got another miniature poodle that was almost as bad.No home, however stately, is immune. That includes the White House. The pit bull of was known for ripping the pants off a French ambassador. And although Bo, the Obamas’ Portuguese water dog, is incident free for now, recent presidential dogs in the dog house included Buddy, the Clintons’ cat-attacking Labrador retriever, and Barney, the Scottish terrier of George and , who bit a journalist.Size is also irrelevant. Small dogs, so often owned by the wealthy, do seem to cause big problems. A 2010 Health Department survey shows 3,609 reported dog-bite incidents, with just as many involving Shih Tzus, Chihuahuas and miniature poodles as pit bulls and Rotweillers.Breeding, especially the intense behavior of some purebreds, seems to make a difference, too, as the writer Martin Kihn learned the hard way. He adopted a giant Bernese mountain dog, a breed sometimes called “the Little Bear of .” The dog “was a status symbol and harder to get from a breeder than getting into Yale,” Mr. Kihn said. But the dog, whose name was Hola, seemed hell-bent on wreaking havoc.While walking past , Hola accosted a perfectly coiffed doyenne and left two big paw prints on a beautiful white dress. “That was the last time I took her to the opera,” said Mr. Kihn, whose new memoir, “Bad Dog: A Love Story,” offers a wry tale of canine rehabilitation. “I really got her because I wanted to be seen with her, that’s all.”It’s a good thing Mr. Kihn wasn’t asked to bring Hola to his Riverside Drive co-op board before moving in. “We just lied and told them she was medium-size and mellow,” he said.Others should have it so easy. To get past highly selective co-op boards, the desperate turn to Elena Gretch, founder of It’s a Dog’s Life, an upmarket training service. She usually requires six sessions (at about $175 a session) to prep dogs for interviews.While some slip dogs Valium, she keeps dogs sober, training them not to bark during the dreaded doorbell test and helping them understand that elevators and lobbies are not powder rooms. And, of course, an elaborate bath before the interview is de rigueur.“Co-op boards are about controlling their environments, and they expect dogs to behave like well-trained little people,” said Ms. Gretch, who faces all kinds of challenges daily. Recent clients included an Upper East Side dermatologist who wants to train his feisty pug puppy to be calm in his office, a type-A lawyer turned fitness entrepreneur whose basset hound had to be prepared for a Hush Puppies shoot, and a financier who wanted his Chesapeake Bay retriever yacht-broken for a to .But all of it that, she added, is nothing compared with the scrutiny of a high-strung co-op board. “When you have to charm so many people, it’s really intimidating,” she said.It’s a good thing dogs don’t have to apply to private schools.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','PARIS — The investigation into what caused the crash of an Air France jet two years ago suffered a major setback, officials said Wednesday, when search crews in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean located one of the plane’s black boxes — only to discover that its memory unit was missing.Martine Del Bono, a spokesman for France’s Bureau of Accident Investigations, said the memory module of the plane’s flight data recorder — which contains information on the plane’s position, speed, altitude and heading when it ran into trouble — had been “dissociated” from its protective housing. “This is no doubt due to the shock of impact with the water,” she said.French investigators said the recorder was located by underwater drones late Tuesday, surrounded by debris from other parts of the airplane. The search continued Wednesday for the missing component, as well as for a second black box, which contains recordings of the conversations in the cockpit in the minutes before the crash.But Ms. Del Bono conceded that the failure to find the data recorder’s memory unit was a disappointment. “We would have hoped that it had remained intact,” she said.All 228 passengers and crew members were killed when Flight 447 went down on June 1, 2009.It crashed in a thunderstorm en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro.Flight recorders are designed to resist the effects of impact, corrosion and pressure. Investigators declined to say Wednesday whether, without its protective housing, the data module — if found — would be sufficiently readable to advance the investigation.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','Such assessments, heard with increasing frequency among Western diplomats and rights advocates, add weight to an argument being made by some that the time has come for the United States and its allies to find new ways to press China on human rights. Until now, the administration of President Obama has sought to separate discussions of the subject from other thorny issues, like differences over currency rates or trade.Although Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this month that she was “deeply concerned” about the crackdown on dissent in China, she has been an advocate for separating human rights concerns from other discussions. In 2009, during her first visit to China as secretary of state, she suggested that human rights should not impede American and Chinese cooperation on climate change, security issues and the global economic downturn.Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the annual human rights talks that several Western countries had with China had become a cynical mechanism that allowed leaders to avoid raising such issues with Chinese officials during the rest of the year.“Such dialogues are often used by governments to justify their lack of engagement and silence on human rights,” Mr. Bequelin said.The meetings also serve Beijing well, keeping talk of uncomfortable issues like religious repression, extralegal detention and the use of torture by the police largely confined to closed-door sessions that more often than not produce few concrete results.As one British diplomat put it, “It allows the Chinese to put all their poison in a box and call it human rights so no other leaders can talk about it.”Despite their criticisms, few diplomats and human rights advocates are calling for an end to the sessions, which have been suspended several times in the past — most recently between 2004 and 2008.But some administration officials are privately saying that if the current talks end with no useful response from China, the human rights discussion should be shifted to the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a bilateral forum attended by high-level officials that will be held in Washington next month.“The U.S. can’t at once be encouraging people in the Middle East to stand up for their rights, and then not respond robustly to what’s happening in China,” said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific director. “Something has to be done.”Although they have long been a target for criticism, such human rights meetings — and there have been more than 100 since the early 1990s involving eight countries and the United Nations — have produced measurable results at times.John Kamm, the executive director of Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates on behalf of political prisoners, said the discussions that took place soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when American-Chinese cooperation was at a high level, spurred the early release of eight people on a list the American delegation presented to Beijing. In more recent years, he said, the discussions paved the way for death penalty reforms that led to a sharp drop in the number of executions in China.Lorne W. Craner, Mr. Posner’s counterpart during President George W. Bush’s administration, said his job was made easier by the White House’s muscular advocacy of democracy and human rights, issues Mr. Bush repeatedly raised with Jiang Zemin, China’s leader at the time. “They couldn’t just roll their eyes and say, ‘Here comes the human rights guy,’ ” said Mr. Craner, who now directs the International Republican Institute, a Washington-based organization that advocates for democracy around the world. “There was no ambiguity about how Bush felt on the issue. The message coming out of the White House now is just not as strong.”In more recent years, as China’s economic might has grown, those who participate in such sessions say they have become alternately combative and perfunctory, with Chinese officials lecturing American and other Western officials on their perceived human rights failings — among them violent crime, racial discrimination and high rates of incarceration in the United States — while refusing to discuss such matters as greater autonomy for Tibetans.Despite his past support of the dialogues, Mr. Kamm of the Dui Hua Foundation said he was prepared to change his tune, especially if Mr. Posner’s efforts this week proved to be for naught — something that will become apparent in due course if none of the more than 100 political prisoners on the administration’s list — among them the American geologist Xue Feng, serving an eight-year sentence for espionage — gain early release.“It’s hard to justify flying a whole bunch of people to Beijing at taxpayer expense if the Chinese only want to talk about human rights in broad ideological terms,” Mr. Kamm said, adding, “If you can’t talk about human rights without talking about human beings, then I don’t think the dialogues should go on.”'"
"'11-04-28,'1','Mr. Jobs defended the timing of Apple’s response to the controversy, saying that “rather than run to the P.R. department,” it set out to determine exactly what happened.“The first thing we always do when a problem is brought to us is we try to isolate it and find out if it is real,” he said. “It took us about a week to do an investigation and write a response, which is fairly quick for something this technically complicated.”He added, “Scott and Phil and myself were all involved in writing the response because we think it is that important.”Some privacy advocates who were harshly critical of Apple last week praised the company’s response, saying it was a step in the right direction.“Apple acknowledged a mistake and they fixed it,” Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in an interview. “That’s a good thing.”Confirming speculation from some security researchers, Apple said in the statement posted on its Web site that the file in people’s iPhones was not a log of their locations but rather “the locations of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers surrounding the iPhone’s location, which can be more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.”Apple said it used the data, which it called a cache, to calculate a device’s location more quickly than through GPS satellites.But Apple acknowledged that it had made mistakes, which it attributed to programming errors, in storing the data for a long time, keeping the file unencrypted and storing the data even when users had chosen to turn off location services.“The system is incredibly complex,” Mr. Forstall said. “We test this carefully but in such a complex system there are sometimes places where we could do better.”Apple said it would reduce the location cache on the iPhone to no more than seven days. The company also said it would stop backing up the cache onto people’s computers and would delete the cache entirely when users turned off location services.Apple also said that it updated its database of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers by using its customers’ phones as sensors. But it said that it could not locate users based on the file on the phone, and that it collected the information in an anonymous and encrypted form. The company cannot identify the phone user from the data, it said.While some security experts have known about the existence of the file for some time, the issue made headlines last week after the researchers reported their findings at a technology conference in . Apple came under heavy criticism for its silence after the discovery.The location report attracted attention from some government officials, including Senator , Democrat of , who sent a stern letter to Apple asking why it was “secretly compiling” the data and what it would be used for. Congressman Edward Markey, a Democrat from , and , the attorney general, also sent letters to Apple asking for an explanation of the issue.acknowledged last week that it, too, collected data about the location of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers from its users.Apple’s statement contained a tidbit about possible future product plans. The company said it also was collecting traffic data from its phones and tablets to build a crowd-sourced traffic database. That would enable Apple to provide real-time traffic information along with navigation advice. Google already uses phones to collect real-time traffic information.Mr. Jobs declined to answer questions about his health or about any plans to return to Apple. Last week, during the company’s quarterly financial report, , the chief operating officer, said, “He continues to be involved in major strategic decisions, and I know he wants to be back full time.”'"
"'11-04-28,'1','The riveting flaws in the roof of the Southwest Airlines jet that recently tore open in flight appear to be poor manufacturing work on that one plane rather than a broader design failure, Boeing’s chief executive said Wednesday.The executive, W. James McNerney, told analysts that preliminary data “points more in that direction.”The National Transportation Safety Board issued an interim report on Monday, saying that a laboratory examination of intact sections of the roof found that rivet holes on one layer of the plane’s skin did not line up properly with an underlying layer.A five-foot hole suddenly ripped open in the cabin roof on April 1, forcing the Southwest jet to make an emergency landing in Arizona.The safety board did not draw any conclusions about the cause of the rupture, which occurred at 34,000 feet. Independent experts said they were surprised that Boeing’s inspectors had not caught such a basic mistake when the plane was built in the mid-1990s.Mr. McNerney said federal investigators were still sorting out what happened.His comments came as Boeing announced that its first-quarter earnings rose 13 percent to $586 million, or 78 cents a share, from $519 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 2 percent to $14.9 billion, from $15.2 billion, on weaker revenue in the commercial airplane business.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','Stocks rose to another high for the year Wednesday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that officials expected the economy to continue recovering as the jobs market strengthened.The Fed said it expected the economy to grow as much as 3.3 percent this year. That is below the Fed’s previous forecast in January, but the Fed also said it was more optimistic about jobs. It now expects the unemployment rate to fall as low as 8.4 percent by the end of the year. The unemployment rate is currently at a two-year low of 8.8 percent. Mr. Bernanke also held his first news conference after the two-day policy meeting. The Fed reiterated that it would keep interest rates low for “an extended period.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 12,690.96. The Dow rose before Mr. Bernanke’s appearance, and it went up an additional 50 points after the Fed chairman spoke. The last time the Dow was this high was in May 2008.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 8.42, or 0.6 percent, to 1,355.66. That was its highest price since June 2008, but is still 13 percent below the record high of 1,565 it reached in October 2007. The Nasdaq composite index rose 22.34, or 0.8 percent, to 2,869.88.The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for small stocks, surpassed its record high of 855.77 reached in July 2007. It closed up 5.27, or 0.6 percent, to 858.31. Small stocks have soared since the market’s rally began; many investors see them as having the best prospects for growth as the economy recovers.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','NEW DELHI — Tibet’s exiled government announced the election of a Harvard legal scholar as its new prime minister on Wednesday, a choice signaling a generational shift within the Tibetan movement as the Dalai Lama moves to relinquish political power.The scholar, Lobsang Sangay, 42, received 55 percent of the roughly 50,000 votes cast by Tibetans scattered around the world. He defeated two other candidates and though his political vision is not yet fully known, he is expected to play a major role in shaping, and possibly sharpening, the political strategy of Tibetan exiles toward China.“Your overwhelming support is humbling and I will do my utmost to live up to your expectations,” Mr. Sangay wrote in a statement posted on his campaign Web site, noting that Tibetans in 30 countries took part in the election.Mr. Sangay’s popularity was partly rooted in a desire for generational change in the exiled Tibetan leadership. He will probably take his post this fall with the exile government in Dharamsala, India, and Tibetans and political analysts will be watching closely to gauge whether he will pursue a more radical tack in trying to win concessions from the Chinese on the fate of Tibet.The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, has pursued a “middle way” strategy in which he seeks “genuine autonomy” for Tibet under Chinese rule, though many younger Tibetans want outright independence. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Sangay can emerge as an independent political force capable of rallying Tibetans inside and outside Tibet.'"
"'11-04-28,'1','But “the future is still bright for oil companies,” he added. “Oil prices will fall back but remain historically high.”An improving world economy returned oil prices to higher levels in 2010 after a sharp drop in 2009. Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 53 percent increase in profit for the fourth quarter of last year. Chevron earnings in that period rose 72 percent, and ConocoPhillips reported a 46 percent rise.On Wednesday, BP was the first of the largest publicly traded oil companies to report first-quarter earnings.For BP, a higher oil price was offset by asset sales to pay for the repercussions from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Earnings were $5.48 billion in the first three months of this year, down from $5.6 billion in the period a year earlier.The company has sold more than $24 billion of assets to raise money to cover the oil spill costs. Production fell as a result. Including lost production from the Gulf accident, production fell 11 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.BP set aside an additional $384 million for the oil spill in the first quarter, bringing the total to $41 billion.BP’s shares have fallen 23 percent in the last 12 months, while those of its largest competitors have risen at least 18 percent.To win back investors, the company focused on exploration and signed cooperation agreements in India and Russia. But its Russian deal with the government-owned Rosneft was held up this year because of a legal challenge from its Russian shareholders. Russia has surpassed Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil producer in the world. New oil from the region could play an important part in ensuring sufficient supplies and the future level of oil prices.Those analysts who predicted a decline in the price of oil said concerns about political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East had increased prices but were likely to fade. At the same time, there are signs that high oil prices discourage consumers from filling their tanks just as the summer vacation season starts in the northern hemisphere.“The oil price is, to an extent, too high at the moment,” said Christopher Wheaton, a director at the asset management firm RCM in London. “We are at the point at which we get demand destruction.”Still, oil prices are expected to remain high enough for companies to increase investments in drilling aimed at raising production in the longer term. Exxon Mobil said last month that it planned to spend about $100 million a day for the next six years on new oil and gas projects.The drilling for reserves in more remote and harder-to-reach areas has increased costs for oil companies as they compete for talent and technology. The Gulf of Mexico oil spill also led regulators to tighten safety rules and delay decisions on exploration permits, often further increasing costs for oil companies.One year after the rig explosion that led to the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP is still seeking to resume drilling in the region’s waters, and investors continue to wait for BP to give a total figure for the costs of the spill.'"

"'11-04-29,'1','Two dozen high-profile New York business leaders plan to release an open letter on Friday urging state lawmakers to legalize same-sex marriage, arguing that the measure would help companies attract and retain employees.The letter’s release comes as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and gay rights advocates prepare what they say will be a major push to pass legislation this spring that would make New York the sixth state in the nation to allow same-sex couples to wed. The letter’s signers, from the legal, financial and real estate worlds, include Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of Tishman Speyer Properties; and Paul E. Singer, a prominent hedge fund executive.“In an age where talent determines the economic winners, great states and cities must demonstrate a commitment to creating an open, healthy and equitable environment in which to live and work,” the letter reads. “As other states, cities and countries across the world extend marriage rights regardless of sexual orientation, it will become increasingly difficult to recruit the best talent if New York cannot offer the same benefits and protection.”The letter reflects efforts by gay rights advocates to broaden their coalition after an embarrassing defeat in Albany, where a proposal to legalize same-sex marriage lost in the State Senate in 2009. This year, advocates are focusing on a few Democrats and Republicans who are thought to be open to switching their votes.Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said she hoped the letter would “provide an opportunity for legislators who may not have heard the voice of business to feel that they’ve got some cover to rethink their position on this issue.” Ms. Wylde helped collect signatures for the letter at the urging of Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, who has been lobbying the Legislature to approve a bill.In an interview, Ms. Quinn said, “I knew there was support out there, yet when you talked and did lobbying in Albany, there was no way to show that to people.”'"
"'11-04-29,'1','MOSCOW — A young Russian nationalist and his common-law wife were convicted Thursday in the particularly brazen murders of a prominent human rights lawyer and a journalist two years ago, as the jury sided with prosecutors who argued that the ideologically driven defendants considered their victims enemies of Russia.The slain lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, 34, had worked to jail violent nationalists and had once pursued a murder case against the man convicted of both fatal shootings, which were carried out at close range in broad daylight on a busy Moscow street near the Kremlin. The journalist, Anastasia Baburova, 25, was a freelancer who happened to be interviewing Mr. Markelov. Both had connections to the loose network of Russian groups opposed to the nationalist and neo-fascist groups that have proliferated here since the fall of the Soviet Union.Members of the country’s beleaguered human rights community immediately praised the verdict as a rare victory for justice in a country where high-profile murders are rarely solved.“Our long experience allows us to distinguish between cases fabricated by the secret services and law enforcement agencies and cases that these services and structures investigate conscientiously,” Oleg P. Orlov, the head of the rights group Memorial said in a statement. “Today we can confirm that the real killers and not someone arbitrarily accused were seated on the defendants’ bench.”The nationalist, Nikita Tikhonov, 30, was found guilty of the fatal shootings, while his common-law wife, Yevgenia Khasis, 26, served as lookout. Both had denied any guilt, and both slashed their wrists this week in what appeared to be an attempt to delay the verdict.Sentencing is expected next month, but their lawyers vowed to appeal.Mr. Markelov’s death added to a growing toll from the community of rights activists here. He had worked closely with Anna Politkovskaya, the investigative journalist who was gunned down in October 2006, and also with Natalya Estemirova, the rights worker who was kidnapped and murdered in July 2009.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','PepsiCo on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, helped by higher sales and higher prices of snacks and drinks. It warned that more price increases were on the horizon.PepsiCo, whose shares rose to their highest level since 2008, said price increases taken earlier in the year to help offset soaring commodity costs were not as large as “we would have liked or expected.” The company said it expected to raise prices again sometime after July 4, during the peak summer selling season for soft drinks.PepsiCo stood by its 2011 earnings growth target, which it said reflected higher commodity costs, difficult economic conditions in developed markets and investments in brand building and emerging markets.PepsiCo’s net income fell to $1.14 billion, or 71 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $1.43 billion, or 89 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding certain items, earnings were 74 cents a share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue rose 27 percent, to $11.94 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $11.71 billion. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, revenue was up 5 percent.Worldwide, volume rose 3 percent in the snacks business and 3.5 percent in the beverage business, excluding the effect of acquisitions. North American beverage volume rose 2 percent.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“It’s comparable in significance to legislation that has happened elsewhere as far as teacher effectiveness but stands apart as far as blue states,” Mr. Edelman said during two Chicago conversations this week.Mr. Edelman spent about 70 days in Illinois over the past nine months, meeting with politicians, educators, lobbyists and others before persuading his board to go whole hog here. He was a mostly behind-the-scenes strategist and never met Dan Montgomery, the key teachers’ union official, until after the bill was passed. But the planets were aligned, especially thanks to a pension-related rift that disrupted alliances between unions and Democratic chiefs.His political action committee raised $3.5 million, with contributors including John Canning Jr., head of a private equity firm and chairman of the Chicago News Cooperative. Mr. Edelman interviewed candidates in 18 state races and backed nine with $650,000. Five won, but the effort provoked attention disproportionate to the dollars and established the group’s brand.He assembled a solid team, made key allies and parried suspicions inspired by his outsider status and strong personality and the union animus of some supporters. His group didn’t get all it craved but won bragging rights among competing national reform groups with similar fund-raising targets.Mr. Edelman’s success in Illinois seems to be, at least in part, a product of genes and upbringing.A political science Ph.D from Oxford University, Mr. Edelman, 40, is one of three high-achieving sons of a distinguished Washington couple, Marian Wright and Peter Edelman. The father, who is Jewish and white, was raised in Minneapolis; attended Harvard Law School; clerked for Arthur Goldberg, the Chicago-bred United States Supreme Court justice; and became a top aide to Robert F. Kennedy.Peter and Marian Wright, a preacher’s daughter and a black Baptist from South Carolina, fell in love after meeting when Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Edelman visited the Mississippi Delta. She founded the Children’s Defense Fund and hired a young Hillary Rodham, who had yet to marry Bill Clinton. The Clintons and Edelmans were close, as Mrs. Edelman became a player in children’s welfare and health care legislation.But the relationship frayed because of the 1996 welfare overhaul signed by President Clinton prompting a harsh op-ed by Mrs. Edelman and Mr. Edelman’s decision to quit a top administration post.Jonah’s mother still runs the Children’s Defense Fund, and his father teaches law. Jonah Edelman started Stand for Children in 1998. He chides the caricatures of “reform” debates and the dueling demonization of unions and charter schools. He knows one education style won’t fit his very different 5-year-old twin boys. And while poverty isn’t an excuse for poor performance, he said, it is undeniably a factor.“We should demonize a system that allows the majority of teachers to not get meaningful feedback to improve their craft or allows those without motivation or skills to stay in the classroom,” he said.It’s a view shared by Mr. Emanuel, a former dancer, who was at the Goodman Theater speaking to Chicago’s very homogeneous arts elite during the C.P.S. meeting. Improving this mess is now his challenge as his real center stage approaches.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','Could anyone have guessed, way back when it was published in 1957, that “Atlas Shrugged,” Ayn Rand’s grandiloquent doorstop of a masterwork, would one day reach the big screen as high-camp comedy? Because stilted prose and silly plotting notwithstanding, Rand’s unrelentingly popular book has exerted a powerful ideological hold on the culture, an influence that has only intensified in recent years with the emergence of the Tea Party. Still, for unintentional yet somehow boring hilarity, the novel can’t touch the cinematic adaptation, which shifts the action to 2016 and presents Rand’s ham-fisted fable of laissez-faire capitalism as something C-Span might make if it ever set out to create a futuristic, proto-libertarian nighttime soap. In the 1980s.“Atlas Shrugged: Part I” may be set only five years from now, but the world it portrays is completely unrecognizable. It imagines an America in the stranglehold of a Soviet-style government, given to legislating equal opportunity and making it illegal for profitable corporations to lay off employees. An opening TV news panic montage lets us know that the country is in the grip of an economic crisis and plagued by oil shortages and rampant unemployment. It’s also apparently beset with bizarre aesthetic forays into the past, when mysterious men in fedoras skulked past hobo trashcan fires on their way into diners where waitresses served homemade pie, and socialites took their hair-styling cues from Aaron Spelling.In this backward-glancing world, it makes sense that trains should once again become the preferred mode of transport of the future. This anachronism should mean good news for the steely blond railroad executive Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) of Taggart Transcontinental, if only her spineless brother James (Matthew Marsden) didn’t insist on letting his friends in Washington tell him how to run his business.Finally tiring of James’s incompetence, Dagny teams up with the visionary metallurgist Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) and the blustery oil magnate Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) to update an old railway line through Colorado. Meanwhile, magnates, moguls, business titans and captains of industry are vanishing, each fresh disappearance marked with a murmured question, “Who is John Galt?”“Atlas Shrugged: Part I” never flinches from its mission to portray those more fortunate as victims of a lazy, parasitic society that would bleed them dry and leave them for dead, given the chance. (“Why all these stupid altruistic urges?” Dagny asks Hank at one point. “What’s wrong with people today?” Hank doesn’t know. He’s just happy to be with someone who hates humanity as attractively as he does.) It’s a hard sell, and you’ve got to admire the gumption and the commitment, but it would take a far smarter, more subtle movie than this even to approach pulling it off.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“The world won’t move forward by itself,” says a narrator. The world needs “the people who do. The ones who tinker, who build, who create.”The campaign portrays these “doers” as people who are known for doing something extraordinary. Print ads feature a new Lenovo laptop in a variety of situations, including as part of the dashboard of a car outfitted with gadgets for a storm chaser, and harnessed to the space between the handlebars on a motorcycle as it is driven through a desert.The tagline on the ads reads, “We make the tools. You make them do.” A digital billboard installation shows a 360-degree moving image of the motorcycle laptop contraption and provides technical details highlighting the laptop’s computing power.To help develop the creative elements of the new campaign, Saatchi & Saatchi conducted research with 18- to 25-year-olds and learned that they were ambitious and optimistic, said Claudine Cheever, the agency’s chief strategy officer. The campaign was designed to embody the ideals of pragmatism, authenticity and the act of getting things done.But aren’t millennials more captivated by design and coolness than pragmatic electronics? Not according to Ms. Cheever, who said technology was “not just a badge, it’s a tool.”The advertising initiative includes digital banner ads and rich media ads on the Web, television spots, digital billboards and a smattering of print ads. The ads will run on cable outlets like ESPN, Bravo and MTV, and on technology Web sites like CNet.com. Outdoor advertising has begun in nine cities, including New York, Atlanta and San Francisco.Lenovo’s last consumer campaign, called “Ideas Anywhere,” was tied to the company’s sponsorship of the Beijing Olympics and ran from August 2008 to November 2009.Before heading out into the real world, the company brought the message in-house and rallied employees with new business cards, T-shirts, building signs and new e-mail signatures. The internal campaign events took place in April in Lenovo’s offices in Madrid and Raleigh, N.C., and was an extension of a employee training program called “The Lenovo Way,” which began in 2009.Leaving no stone unturned, Lenovo also rebranded the packaging for its products and the kiosks it takes to trade shows.One thing Lenovo already had going for it in the consumer brand space was its I.B.M. ThinkPad brand.But Lenovo had to take that brand recognition and make it “relevant to a broader consumer base,” Ms. Cheever said. “How do you take the ThinkPad equity and mine that for something a 25-year-old is going to relate to?”The company purchased the I.B.M. PC division in 2005, and has since begun manufacturing smartphones in China. It announced a hybrid tablet notebook, the IdeaPad U1, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. The ad campaign will feature new products, including the Lenovo ThinkPad X1, a slim laptop aimed to compete with the MacBook Air laptop.The campaign also includes various media partnerships, including one with the youth-oriented nonprofit organization DoSomething.org. The co-branded campaign will begin this summer and will encourage teams of people under 25 to take on projects to improve their communities. The winning teams will be eligible to win Lenovo products.Lenovo’s Mexico office is also forging a media partnership with MTV Mexico to create a new reality show Web series and co-branding opportunities to aim at the youth market in that region. “I don’t believe you can have a technology brand that doesn’t come from the youth market today.” Mr. Roman said.'"

"'11-04-29,'1','How much, really, do average, non-reptile-obsessed people need to know about snakes? Not nearly as much as is covered in “Wild About Snakes,” a block of shows this weekend on Nat Geo Wild. And that makes you wonder who is actually likely to watch this stuff. Is this slithering mass of programming, though it includes some tsk-tsking about the cult of illegal snake trafficking and ownership, really more interested in encouraging it? “Have a smoldering fascination with exotic or poisonous snakes?” it seems to say. “Let’s see if we can fan it into a full-fledged mania.”Taken individually many of these programs are probably harmless enough. For instance “Anaconda: Queen of the Serpents,” on Sunday night, looks at the work being done in Venezuela by a husband-and-wife research team, Jesus Rivas and Sarah Corey, who have been gathering data on these huge, nonvenomous snakes. Yes, in the voyeuristic style typical of creature shows, we see these scientists get bitten and wrapped up by anacondas. (“I have to say, that does not hurt as much as a tetanus shot,” Dr. Corey says after a bite.) But at least they’re gathering data about the animal’s reproductive and feeding habits that might help preservation efforts as its habitat shrinks.That program, though, is surrounded on the Sunday schedule by others with names like “Rattler: Behind the Fangs” and “Snake Wranglers: Death Adder Duet.” The little bit of interesting science in the anaconda program doesn’t stand a chance of emerging from all that writhing and hissing.Same deal on Saturday night. In “Robo-Snake,” an episode of the series “Dangerous Encounters,” Brady Barr, that program’s featured doer of idiotic things in pursuit of scary animals, tries to develop a robot that he can send into snake holes to catch the reptiles so that he doesn’t have to crawl in himself. It’s kind of amusing (and understandable, given that he was bitten by a python a few seasons back and bitten again by the Internet mockery generated by that video). But it’s part of a five-hour block of snake-related “Dangerous Encounters,” about four hours more of this show than anyone needs in one sitting.The worst offender of the bunch, though, is “Snake Underworld” on Friday night, in which Henry Rollins, a former rocker still working the bad-boy image, promises to reveal the dark world of illegal snake trafficking and collecting, ominously suggesting that we all have next-door neighbors with deadly mambas and such in their closets.Mr. Rollins does introduce us to an assortment of people who have somehow gotten the idea that the best way to show their love for snakes is to collect an absurd number of them and force the animals to spend their lives in Tupperware containers. But this program isn’t really interested in blowing the whistle on exotic animal importation. It’s interested in appealing to the people who like this kind of thing or think they might.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','Eastman Kodak posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss after it made less money from licensing its technology, sending its shares down 10 percent.The photography company said Thursday that film business revenue declined by 14 percent, to $367 million. Kodak said part of the decrease was a result of a rise in raw material costs, particularly in silver, which is used to manufacture film.Kodak’s executives declined to say how much the rise in silver prices hurt earnings during the first quarter. In February, the company said that in 2010, every $1 change in the price of silver per troy ounce affected earnings by $10 million to $15 million.Spot silver on Thursday touched a high of $49.56 an ounce. It has gained nearly 60 percent so far this year.Last year, Kodak received a $550 million one-time payment as part of a licensing agreement. Many investors see Kodak’s value in its lucrative portfolio of intellectual property. It has more than 1,000 patents, and in 2010, it made an estimated $630 million from its licenses, according to Argus Research.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','Canalys, a technology market research firm, noted that when tablet computers are grouped with PCs, Apple becomes the fourth largest PC manufacturer in the world with almost 10 percent of the market. The three biggest PC makers, Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Dell, are all making tablets that don’t use Microsoft software.One other indication of Microsoft’s changing stature: for the first time, Apple’s quarterly profits exceeded Microsoft’s — $5.99 billion compared with $5.23 billion. Last year, Apple surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization and in revenue.“It’s a huge testament to Apple,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial. “There is clearly some disruption in the PCs.” However, Mr. Gillis noted that Microsoft Windows 7 is the fastest-selling operating system in history. He thinks Microsoft will probably make a move into tablets later this year with its expected release of Windows 8. In any case, Mr. Gillis said, “PCs aren’t going to disappear.”Microsoft also has found itself left behind in software for cellphones. It recently acted to ramp up its presence on mobile phones through an agreement with Nokia, the Finnish handset maker that is troubled, but still the largest makers of cellphones in the world. The two companies are working together on new mobile phones that would use Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system.Microsoft has seen declines in its operating software before, as recently as last year’s first fiscal quarter when it fell 4 percent.To be sure, other parts of the company’s business remain strong and helped Microsoft report Thursday that net income in its third quarter rose 31 percent to $5.23 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $4 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Revenue climbed 13 percent, to $16.43 billion, from $14.5 billion.The company’s Office software, where it has no significant competition, grew 21 percent, to $5.25 billion. Office 2010 is the fastest-selling version of Office ever, Microsoft said, with businesses deploying the software at five times the rate of its predecessor.However, revenue from Microsoft’s entertainment and devices, which includes the Xbox 360 video game console and the innovative Kinect game controller that interprets gestures and voice commands, gained 60 percent, to $1.94 billion. Kinect, a sensor that lets players interact with video games without having to hold a controller, did particularly well, selling 2.4 million units in the quarter. Customers bought 2.7 million Xbox 360s.Microsoft blamed the economy for the lower revenue from Windows. Consumers are saving their money rather than buying new computers, said Peter Klein, Microsoft’s chief financial officer. Asked in an interview about the impact of tablets on computer sales, he acknowledged that “it’s part of the story.”“There are a whole host of consumer purchases vying for the consumer wallet,” Mr. Klein said.Sales of Windows for consumers PCs fell 8 percent in the quarter, Microsoft said. Windows for netbooks, the small laptops that had been big sellers until tablets came along, declined 40 percent, highlighting the rapid shift in computer buying habits.Revenue from Microsoft’s online properties like the MSN portal and Bing search engine rose 14 percent, to $648 million. The unit lost $726 million in operating income, continuing a pattern of losses.Two years ago, Microsoft signed an agreement to take over Yahoo’s search business to create a more formidable rival to Google. However, Yahoo’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz, said last week that the partnership had not yielded the expected financial results for Yahoo and that technical glitches by Microsoft were to blame.Downbeat reports about personal computer shipments in early 2011 had raised questions about Microsoft’s future dominance. Microsoft has developed an operating system for smartphones, but it is on relatively few phones. It does not have software that makers of tablet computers want. In after-hours trading, Microsoft’s shares lost 1.4 percent. They had ended regular trading at $26.71, up 33 cents, or 1.25 percent.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“We will abide by the cease-fire from now on, and local commanders will meet regularly to avoid misunderstanding,” he said in Phnom Penh.The Thai regional commander, Thawatchai Samutsakorn, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “The declaration on the Cambodian side is a good sign. Let’s try to enforce it.”The prime ministers of both nations have said they are ready to negotiate a peace agreement, but they have differed over the venue and timing of a meeting. Cambodia has sought international help in brokering a truce, but Thailand insists that the conflict is a purely bilateral matter.While each side has accused the other of starting the battles, the conflict has been connected from the start with the long-running political crisis in Thailand, with nationalists accusing the government of failing to protect Thai territory.The latest engagement, some analysts say, reflects the agendas and ambitions of the politicized Thai military, seeking to assert its influence and leverage in advance of a parliamentary election expected in June or July.“It’s a good way for the military to take a powerful position in politics,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, an specialist on Thailand at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.The election is likely to bring renewed tensions to political conflicts that flared into violence a year ago, when the so-called red shirt protesters attempted to unseat the government. Their prolonged protests were crushed last May by the military in street battles in which about 90 people were killed.The Thai military staged a coup in 2006 and has played a powerful role behind the scenes since civilian rule was restored in 2007. In the coming election, a military-backed government led by the Democrat Party is being challenged by parties broadly aligned with the red shirt opposition.The Thai foreign minister, Kasit Piromya, headed to Jakarta on Thursday to discuss the clashes with Marty Natalegawa, the foreign minister of Indonesia, which holds the annual chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and has offered to mediate. The Thai military has rejected an offer by Indonesia to provide military observers to keep the peace along the border.On Wednesday, the Thai defense minister, Prawit Wongsuwan, withdrew from planned cease-fire talks with his Cambodian counterpart, Tea Banh. The reason given by a Thai Army spokesman was that news reports in Cambodia had portrayed the talks as a sign that Thailand was surrendering.“The military is going solo,” said Mr. Pavin, the Thailand specialist. “In many ways, it shows how useless the Foreign Ministry is. Basically it has been taken over by the military.”'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“This beatification is different because this pope is different. He’s a man with a role in history, not just in church history,” said Andrea Riccardi, the founder of the Community of Sant’Egidio, a liberal Catholic group and a biographer of John Paul who testified in his favor in the beatification process. “The seal of sainthood doesn’t close the debate on history,” he added. “In a certain sense, for many Catholics he’s already a saint, even without beatification and, let’s be honest, even without a miracle.”Saint-making is intensely political. The impulse must arise from the faithful, but ultimately most saints’ causes are championed by religious groups with the organizational skills, and fund-raising, to keep their causes alive. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and head of the Vatican’s doctrinal watchdog, Pope Benedict in 1989 criticized this tendency, saying there had been too many beatifications of marginal figures.But John Paul was an avid saint-maker who loosened the rules to make the process easier. He beatified more than 1,300 people and canonized 482 saints. Since 2005, Benedict has beatified 790 people and canonized 34 saints.For John Paul to be beatified, a Vatican committee had to rule that he had performed a miracle. (To advance to sainthood, he needs an additional miracle.) In the proceedings, doctors and experts testified that a French nun had been miraculously cured from Parkinson’s disease after praying to John Paul. Their testimony was then notarized, and the committee certified the miracle.To Vatican watchers, John Paul’s beatification is a snapshot of the Catholic Church in 2011 — mingling deep faith and dense bureaucracy, grass-roots devotion and top-down power politics, the medieval and the contemporary.Those who cannot make the journey to Rome can follow the beatification on Twitter, become fans of John Paul on Facebook or watch the proceedings on the Vatican’s own YouTube channel. (This is, after all, the institution that quickly embraced the printing press and mass communications and whose own office of evangelization gave rise to the term propaganda.) A vial of John Paul’s blood, saved by a Rome hospital in case he needed a transfusion, will now be used as a holy relic.In many ways, the beatification underscores how Benedict, a bookish yet never predictable pope whose papacy has been racked by crises and is intellectually focused on Europe, still derives much of his light and heat from his telegenic, globe-trotting predecessor.But it also shows how dark clouds still hang over John Paul’s papacy, not least the sex abuse crisis and his close ties to the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, the Mexican founder of the wealthy and powerful religious order Legionaries of Christ. Father Maciel, a charismatic leader hailed by John Paul as a model of dynamic priesthood, was later found to have fathered several children and abused seminarians. Last year, Benedict took the step of placing the entire order under Vatican receivership.But during John Paul’s papacy, Vatican officials blocked an investigation of Father Maciel, and the pope publicly honored him in 2004 even after seminarians had come forward with allegations of abuse. Father Maciel was particularly close to John Paul’s longtime personal secretary, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, now the archbishop of Krakow, who has championed the beatification.Critics say that in beatifying John Paul, the Vatican is trying to close the history books before they have been fully opened.In a rare example of a meeting of the minds by traditionalists and progressives, The Remnant, a conservative Catholic publication, published a long statement on why the sex abuse scandal and the pope’s hazy ties to Father Maciel were grounds against beatification. (Unlike progressives, it also criticized John Paul’s loosening of the liturgy and his desire to reach out to people of other faiths.) The Catholic scholars who signed the statement also questioned the French nun’s cure. “The nexus between the purported cure of the nun and a ‘night of prayers to John Paul II’ seems dubious,” they wrote. “Did the prayers for this nun exclude the invocation of any and all recognized saints?”Asked recently in Rome whether the sex abuse crisis had become an issue in the beatification process, Cardinal Angelo Amato, head of the Vatican’s Congregation for the Causes of Saints, said that John Paul’s Christian virtues were on trial, not his papacy. “Sin exists. Our sins exist. But this doesn’t impede the holiness of others,” he added.But even he acknowledged the unusual speed of the beatification. John Paul “didn’t have to wait in the supermarket line,” he said, adding that the beatification proceedings were carried out with “the utmost attentiveness.”Yet the congregation is normally far more slow and cautious, and the beatifications of Pius XII, who reigned during World War II; Pope Paul VI, who presided over the Second Vatican Council; and John Paul I, the immediate predecessor of John Paul II, are still in progress. (Pope John XXIII, who opened the Second Vatican Council, has already been beatified.)For many who have come to Rome, however, John Paul’s beatification is simply an occasion to celebrate.As she stood near St. Peter’s Square with a smile on her face and a yellow bandanna around her neck, Carla Fachini, from Paraná, Brazil, could barely contain her excitement. “We’re really happy,” she said. “It’s a big party.”'"
"'11-04-29,'1','Saab Automobile won a critical reprieve Thursday in its effort to stay afloat.General Motors and the Swedish government agreed to a tentative deal on Thursday with Saab’s parent company that would allow a financing deal with a Russian businessman.The deal breaks a logjam that has left Saab’s future in doubt since early April, when the carmaker halted production at its plant in Trollhattan, Sweden, after it was unable to pay suppliers.Spyker Cars, the Dutch sports car maker that bought Saab from G.M. in 2010, has struggled to get the company onto solid footing. It had sought to raise cash by selling Saab’s real estate assets to the Russian businessman Vladimir A. Antonov, then leasing them back. But the deal was held up by conditions imposed by the European Investment Bank, G.M. and the Swedish government.On Thursday, James Cain, a G.M. spokesman in Detroit, said that “G.M. has a tentative agreement with Saab that could allow Mr. Antonov to come into Saab as a shareholder.”“But it’s contingent on Saab meeting various commitments,” Mr. Cain said.He added: “This will allow them to solve their immediate financial crisis. Saab has homework they have to do with other parties to create the conditions under which we can move forward.”Mr. Antonov, previously a Spyker shareholder, had to sell his stock as a condition of the Saab acquisition amid allegations of suspicious financial dealings. He said Thursday’s deal showed that the claims were unfounded.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','BEIJING — The chief United States representative to human rights discussions with China offered a cheerless portrait of those talks after their conclusion on Thursday, saying the United States was worried by “a serious backsliding” of freedoms in China and at loggerheads with Beijing officials over many aspects of the issue.“Our disagreements are profound,” the envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Michael H. Posner, said at a news conference at the United States Embassy here in Beijing, even as he expressed optimism that China’s rights situation would improve over time.In the two days of talks this week, however, Mr. Posner indicated that Chinese officials offered few if any concrete responses to American queries about the conditions of the human rights and legal activists who have been seized or imprisoned by Chinese authorities. And he said that the talks, while “respectful in tone,” were colored with new seriousness on both sides by the perception that disagreements between the nations had widened.“I don’t think anybody stood up and said, ‘Oh yeah, things have gotten worse,’ except me,” he said. But, he added, “there’s no question that the atmosphere is different, because the facts are different.”Since the imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October, Chinese authorities have detained, imprisoned or harassed hundreds of critics, lawyers, bloggers, writers and other gadflies deemed a threat to the state’s security. The pace of detentions and harassment accelerated markedly this spring after pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East prompted an anonymous online campaign for a “jasmine revolution” in China.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','KAMPALA, Uganda – The leading opposition politician in Uganda was arrested Thursday after police prevented him from leading a demonstration here, only a day after being granted bail from a previous arrest over a similar protest.Dr. Kizza Besigye, a retired army colonel and former confidante to President Yoweri Museveni, was hauled out of his car and members of his staff were severely beaten after a two-hour standoff with police in central Kampala as Mr. Besigye was driving slowly to work from his home, followed by hundreds of supporters on foot.A Ugandan police spokeswoman said officers tried to get Mr. Besigye to use a different route as he entered the city center but that the politician refused. As the crowds built up, a plainclothes officer shattered Mr. Besigye’s passenger window with a hammer and sprayed Mr. Besigye in the face with pepper spray, Reuters reported, before officers detained him.“We tried to engage him, so that he could continue alone, but he resisted,” said the police spokeswoman, Judith Nabakooba. “His supporters shouted, they started becoming rowdy, and started hitting vehicles with stones.”“For security reasons,” Ms. Nabakooba said, “we decided to use the last option, which was to get him out of his vehicle.”Mr. Besigye, who was released on bail Wednesday after being arrested last Thursday for leading protests, had attempted to stage a fifth-round of his walk-to-work demonstration against rising commodity prices Thursday morning, but was stopped by police outside his gate. Mr. Besigye then got into his car and drove into town instead, with crowds trailing behind.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','As spectacles go, the N.F.L.’s labor circus cannot hold a candle to say, a Game 7-winning goal in overtime in Boston or someone named Gary Neal keeping the Spurs’ dynasty alive for another day with a 3-pointer at the buzzer of regulation. We had high hopes for fireworks, as the N.F.L. lawyers kept promising, with America’s favorite game descending into utter chaos. Cue Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman: “Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!”Instead, we get an N.F.L. draft going on as scheduled Thursday night, when everyone will dutifully ignore that pesky little federal court order lifting the lockout. There will be a lot of polite handshaking and yes-sirs. Dogs and cats will behave as usual, except even they might be booing Commissioner Roger Goodell.Perhaps the spiral of Goodell into Bud Selig/Gary Bettman territory of hated commissioners is the most riveting piece of all of this. His epically terrible op-ed in The Wall Street Journal this week only accelerated this, as Dan Wetzel of Yahoo.com points out, and fans will have their chance for a televised rebuttal boo at the draft. Or 32 of them, if they choose. Judge Susan Richard Nelson already got her rebuttal boo in when she denied the N.F.L.’s request for a stay: “The world of ‘chaos’ the N.F.L. claims it has been thrust into -- essentially the ‘free-market’ system this nation otherwise willfully operates under — is not compelled by this court’s order.” Zing.The quirk of Goodell’s likely taking the brunt of fan displeasure is that, as Ray Ratto writes on CBSSports.com, he works for the N.F.L. owners. This is their circus. He’s just driving the clown car. Perhaps he can toot a horn to signal each team being on the clock.For a bit, we will all be distracted by the question of whether Cam Newton will go No. 1 to the Panthers. It remains an open question, as The Charlotte Observer reports the team has narrowed its choices to four. While most everyone envisions Newton with a Panther on his helmet, SI.com’s Andrew Perloff sketches out a sequence of how far he falls if the Panthers choose someone else. The former N.F.L. coach Brian Billick believes that will happen, predicting Newton will fall to No. 10 as Carolina picks cornerback Patrick Peterson. The weird part comes after the selections are made, when the entire draft class wanders into this labor miasma, writes Jason Cole on Yahoo.com. It’s why the whole atmosphere is a little chillier than usual, writes Sam Farmer in The Los Angeles Times, even if it is finally warm in New York.'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“We’re a $100 billion-plus corporation that has squandered its buying power, has no standardization across business units and does not reward efficiency,” said Howard Glaser, the director of state operations, who has been charged by Mr. Cuomo with wringing dollars out of the state’s bottom line.Some of the problems became clear to the administration before it took office, when Mr. Cuomo’s transition team moved to the vacant half of a floor leased in a building on the Upper West Side by the State Department of Taxation and Finance.Curious about why the department had so much excess space, Mr. Glaser asked state officials for an inventory of all real estate leased or owned at taxpayer expense. The answer: No such inventory existed.Mr. Glaser imposed a statewide freeze on new leasing while UGL Equis, a real estate consulting firm, conducted an audit of the state’s real estate holdings. The firm discovered that more than a quarter of the state’s office space in New York City and in the capital region was vacant. In Albany, at least 10,000 state office workstations sat idle, and Corning Tower, the imposing 42-story marble edifice that anchors the capital’s skyline and once symbolized modern state government, is one-third empty.The administration has since ordered what is known in the private sector as a “restacking” of its real estate, in which different agencies will have to consolidate and downsize office space across the state so that the government’s physical footprint matches the size of its work force.Duplication is another major cause of inefficiency. A staggering 1,719 vendors are paid to supply New York’s sprawling state government with pens, paper and paper clips. The state owns 4,800 computer servers, which on average are at half-capacity, yet agencies that are short of data storage space continue to order new servers. The state pays three companies to run 27 call centers at a cost of $115 million a year.Such problems are a symptom, Cuomo administration officials said, of New York’s gradual government sprawl. Over decades, individual agencies have taken more responsibility for decisions like office leasing and purchasing, with little pressure to coordinate or to share costs.One result is that the state’s hundreds of agencies now pay widely varying prices for the same goods and services.State correction officials, who provide health care and prescription drugs for prisoners, buy blood-test strips for $8 a vial from AgaMatrix, while the state’s public health programs pay $25.51 for nearly identical vials from Roche Diagnostics. In some cases, an agency pays different prices to different suppliers for the same product. One agency paid a vendor $325 for a package of printer toner cartridges, and another vendor $511 for the same package.One company, Unisys, provides similar technical support services to 19 state agencies at 19 prices, under 19 contracts. That costs the state money, officials said, while creating headaches and needless paperwork for Unisys.“A Java programmer is a Java programmer,” said Naren Patel, an official at Unisys. “But every agency has their own different requirements. From the vendor perspective, it’s difficult to monitor.”An audit of the state’s procurement practices, authorized by Mr. Cuomo’s predecessor, Gov. David A. Paterson, and conducted by Accenture, found 500 state employees who work to procure goods and services for agencies. The Cuomo administration expects to establish a centralized procurement agency, which state officials say could reduce that head count by half, as well as empowering an existing State Office for Technology to force changes in computer system contracts.The new administration, in the meantime, has deployed in-house “SWAT teams” to different agencies to renegotiate procurement contracts with vendors. The goal is to reduce spending on goods and services by roughly $600 million over the next five years.“New York State is the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company,” said Robert Friess, an Accenture executive who worked on the audit. “We were surprised, given the spending power the state has, at the very decentralized way in which they operate.”Some previous cost-saving efforts have resulted in more waste, the review found.The State Office of General Services, which manages much of the state’s real estate holdings and vehicle leasing, formed an in-house bureau to provide architectural and construction services to other state agencies. But the bureau charges so much for its services that the state saves no money, according to one audit. The Office of General Services bills other state agencies as much as 38 percent of a project’s total cost for management and design work — two or three times the industry standard — and then outsources the work to private contractors at a lower cost. The agency is allowed to keep the difference.Still, no example is more emblematic of the state’s administrative problems, Mr. Glaser said, than a continuing effort by the State Office of Children and Family Services to develop a new computer system for tracking children in foster care. The program was begun in 1993, Mr. Glaser said, when Mr. Cuomo’s father, Mario M. Cuomo, was governor.The system has yet to be completed. The total price tag so far? It is $351 million.“My daughter was born that year,” Mr. Glaser said, “and she’ll be off to college by the time this thing is done.”'"
"'11-04-29,'1','“Buckingham Palace shares the view of the Foreign Office that it is not considered appropriate for the Syrian Ambassador to attend the wedding,” the statement said, denoting royal approval of the decision.It noted that only on Wednesday, Mr. Khiyami had been invited to a different encounter with British officialdom when he was summoned to the Foreign Office to receive a formal protest about the use of force against protesters.In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Khiyami said that he found the British snub “a bit embarrassing” but that he did not believe it jeopardize other aspects of Syria’s relationship with Britain. “I’m not a man who likes to attend events,” he said. “If it wasn’t for the importance of” the royal wedding, “I wouldn’t have thought about it,” he told the BBC.News of the invitation to the Syrian envoy had received a particularly sharp response from members of the opposition Labour Party since two former Labour prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, have not been invited while a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, has accepted an invitation. Margaret Thatcher, another former Conservative prime minister, was reported to have declined an invitation because of poor health.The guest list had drawn earlier controversy when the crown prince of Bahrain volunteered not to take up an invitation because of protests in Britain over the harsh treatment of antigovernment demonstrators in his country.But some opposition figures on Thursday said Bahrain’s ambassador should also be denied an invitation to the wedding. British newspapers have also raised questions about invitations extended to diplomats from other countries where Britain has criticized human rights records, notably Iran, North Korea and Zimbabwe.“There is blood on the hands of other regimes who want to promote positive media coverage by walking down tomorrow’s red carpet,” said Denis MacShane, a Labour lawmaker and former Foreign Office minister, adding, “we are seeing crass insensitivity in allowing representatives of some of the world’s most odious regimes take part in the royal wedding.”Many other members of royal families — from lands as disparate as Belgium, Bulgaria and Brunei — are on the official list of guests, along with Elton John and the soccer player David Beckham and his wife, Victoria.Invitations to the wedding rank among the hottest tickets in memory, offering an exalted place inside Westminster Abbey as about 5,000 police officers patrol the city outside and broadcasters send images of the event around the world. Britons have organized about 5,500 officially approved street parties to accompany the event, and the wedding day has been declared a public holiday. Some enthusiasts are already camping out in the streets outside Westminster Abbey to secure a good view.'"

"'11-04-30,'0','Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, said Friday that its first-quarter profit soared more than fivefold. It also raised its financial outlook for the year as a growing economic recovery increased demand for its mining and construction equipment.The results topped analysts’ expectations, and shares rose $2.77, or 2.46 percent, to $115.41.Its first-quarter profit reflected an industrial sector that is growing again, with most of its sales growth coming from the sale of big machines. When the recession hit in 2007, construction and mining companies cut back their spending on heavy machinery first, Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s director of investors, told analysts Friday.For more than two years, companies held back their investment. But now they appear to have no choice but to replace aging machinery, raising Caterpillar’s sales, Mr. DeWalt said.That means spending is likely to continue as companies replace more vehicles and even expand on growing demand.The company said its net income climbed to $1.23 billion, or $1.84 a share, from $233 million, or 36 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.30 a share on revenue of $11.43 billion.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','Tobacco companies are not liable to Missouri hospitals for money spent on patients with smoking-related illnesses who could not pay their medical bills, a St. Louis jury said.About 40 Missouri hospitals sued the Philip Morris unit of the Altria Group, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the Lorillard Tobacco Company and other cigarette makers in 1998, claiming they manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health effects of smoking. The hospitals were seeking more than $455 million in damages, ranging from about $300,000 for some hospitals to $86.4 million for the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo.The hospitals argued that the industry’s actions had raised spending for unreimbursed and uncompensated tobacco-related health care. The tobacco companies denied any responsibility for patient care costs at the hospitals or any financial losses by the hospitals. The jury, in Missouri Circuit Court in St. Louis, rejected the hospitals’ claims on a 9-3 vote Friday in the seventh day of deliberations.“The jury correctly rejected the entirety of the hospital’s claims,” Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said in a statement. The jury agreed with Philip Morris “that ordinary cigarettes are not negligently designed or defective,” he said.The hospitals haven’t decided whether to appeal, their lawyer, Kenneth Brostron, said.The case is the third such health care cost-recovery claim to reach trial, according to regulatory filings by Altria. The tobacco industry won the first, in Ohio, in 1999. The second initially resulted in a $17.8 million award for a health insurer by a New York jury in 2001. That was reversed on appeal in 2004.The Missouri suit, which did not include patients as plaintiffs, went to trial in January.The hospitals, which provide care to indigent patients and others who do not pay, represent the majority of licensed, adult acute care hospital beds in Missouri, according to the complaint. The hospitals said medical ethics required them to serve people in need regardless of their ability to pay.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','First-quarter profit for Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical company, more than tripled as strong sales of crucial drugs and lower costs from integrating its Schering-Plough acquisition offset competition from generic drugs, the company said Friday.The results beat Wall Street expectations and suggest drug sales and cost savings from acquiring Schering-Plough were starting to pay off.Merck shares rose 18 cents Friday to close at $35.95. Net income in the quarter was $1.04 billion, or 34 cents a share, up from $299 million, or 9 cents a share, in 2010’s first quarter.Revenue edged up 1 percent to $11.58 billion. That includes several billion dollars from products added in the Schering-Plough acquisition in November 2009. Excluding numerous one-time items, net income was $2.86 billion, or 92 cents a share.On that basis, analysts had forecast earnings of 84 cents a share and revenue of $11.38 billion. Analysts typically exclude one-time items in their estimates.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','Fourteen of the town’s other businesses also collapsed; only two survived mostly in one piece, a gas station and an appliance shop. The police station, the town hall, the post office, four of six churches: None of them were left standing.“We crawled our way out of the building,” said Mayor Gregg Kennedy, 49. “Then I bent over and I cried like a baby. It’s the only thing at that time I could do.”Nearby towns have jumped in to help, setting up shelters, serving hamburgers, sending in clothes. The Red Cross is here, as are other emergency services. Gov. Haley Barbour stopped by Smithville, which is in the northeast corner of the state, to offer assurances that more help was on the way. The governor said he had rarely seen such destruction and mentioned that the casualty count might still rise.“We know there is a tremendous amount of debris, and the possibility that the waterways surrounding this area contain human remains,” Mr. Barbour said. “We are hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.”Most residents have moved in with relatives and friends in other towns. On Friday, some returned to their homes to salvage what they could, but many did not know where to start or what to pick up first: a shattered picture frame with a wedding photo, an artificial flower arrangement, a dirty pink teddy bear.But they had little trouble making peace with the tornado’s path.“We are supposed to learn something from it,” said Mary Ann Nabors, as she swept the porch of her antique store, the Pink Flamingo, in a building that had been in her family for generations and was once a general store. It was considered “the Wal-Mart of Smithville,” she said. “Hardship happens to you. I did not know that all my life. When God sends you hardship, he is not taking something away. He is giving you something better.”As some of them looked around, it was hard not to think about the immediate aftermath. The tornado stripped a few people of their clothes and covered them in mud. Ruth Estis, who was blind and elderly, was pried from the arms of her husband, Roy Lee Estis, and carried away. She died. Mr. Estis died that evening when his heart gave out. The Cox family lost its father, Jessie, to the tornado, while directly next door his son’s house sat untouched, one of the few.As the storm neared, C. J. Thompson, a junior in high school, had huddled with his family in the hallway of his house. His mother, just out of the shower, was covered in a quilt. His best friend held the 2-year-old. The exchange student from Belgium who was living with the family was in the corner.“Pray, pray, pray!” shouted his mother, Marcie Pearce, as the tornado hit the house. She recalled: “I felt it sucking me in, and stuff was hitting me in the back of the head.”Nobody in the house was badly hurt. But just paces away, neighbors could not hold on. Making his way out of the rubble immediately after the storm, C. J. found two of them dead. Around the back of the house, he saw two small children, babies, he said. He took off his two T-shirts and draped them over their bodies. His girlfriend he found unscathed in her bathtub.Up the street, Caroline Boyd, 66, saw the funnel cloud from her window and ran to her hallway. The storm sucked her into her den. It lifted up her house, turned it like a spinning coin and then set it down again several feet from the foundation. An oak tree fell next to it and anchored the house, keeping the wind from hauling Mrs. Boyd and her home away.“I felt the house swirling around,” she said. “Then it was gone.”“I have been through cancer four times,” she said. “It just wasn’t my time to go. But this house and that house yonder were not so lucky. There was death on either side of me.”'"

General Prats, the former chief of the Chilean Army, had been an outspoken opponent of the Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet.The killings were part of Operation Condor, a secret operation by right-wing officials in seven South American countries in the 1970s and ’80s to eliminate political dissent.Mr. Arancibia had been a member of an ultraright terrorist group that had killed another Chilean Army chief, Gen. Rene Schneider, in Chile in 1970. After that killing, Mr. Arancibia fled to Argentina, where he later became Chile’s liaison with the Argentine secret police.His body, with 10 to 12 stab wounds to his chest and back, was discovered by his partner late Thursday night, according to an Argentine official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Argentine police had not arrested any suspects by late Friday, and were investigating several leads, including robbery, a crime of passion or a disgruntled worker. Mr. Arancibia had been running a taxi business with four cars and four drivers.'"

Such laws, intended to hide a problem rather than correct it, and to punish the messenger rather than abhor and punish the crime, are a heartbreaking misuse of our legislative system.Whether or not documenting these mass-confinement facilities becomes illegal, it is incumbent upon caring humans to shut them down by reducing or eliminating the demand for their products. Every vegan meal is a step away from degradation and toward dignity for the billions of animals who suffer for the standard American diet.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','“Every time Americans have to shell out $60 or $80 to fill their tanks, they mutter under their breaths about government and it puts pressure on Congress and the White House to do something,” said , the former Democratic senator from who is now co-chairman of an energy project at the Bipartisan Policy Center in . “But it’s just howling at the moon. The basic laws of supply and demand haven’t changed.”House Speaker unwittingly gave the Democrats a political opening to pile on the oil companies by saying in an interview with ABC News last week that oil companies should “pay their fair share in taxes” and that Congress ought to reconsider some of the tax incentives they enjoy. He has since walked away from those remarks and said that raising any taxes would choke off the economic recovery and lead to higher prices of gasoline and other goods.His comments came as lawmakers from both parties were home on recess, hearing a torrent of constituent complaints about the high cost of gasoline at the same time major oil companies were reporting near-record quarterly profits. , the world’s largest oil company, said it earned $10.7 billion in the first three months of the year, and other companies reported similarly robust earnings.Mr. Obama seized on the opportunity to try to deflect some of the heat he has been feeling as gas prices have steadily climbed. He noted wryly at a political fund-raiser last weekend that his poll numbers tend to go up and down with pump prices, even as he admitted he had no “silver bullet” to bring those prices down in the short term. But he found ammunition in the tax breaks the oil industry has enjoyed for decades, portraying the industry as undeserving of them at a time when government needs all the revenue it can get.“As we work together to reduce our deficits,” Mr. Obama said in a letter to Congressional leaders last week, “we simply can’t afford these wasteful subsidies.” Mr. Obama says the money saved should be used to finance more research into clean energy alternatives — a proposal he has made in his last two budget requests that has largely been ignored.“The odds are low that the tax repeal goes through as a stand-alone measure, but you might see it as part of a broader deal,” said Michael A. Levi, an energy and environment specialist at the . He said it was in Mr. Obama’s interest to keep the issue alive both to align Republicans with the unpopular oil companies and to use as leverage as new budget negotiations begin., the Senate Democratic leader, said he would press for a vote as early as next week on repealing the tax subsidies. Democrats hope to paint Republicans who vote against the plan as tools of the industry.“Now is not the time to stand idly by while large oil and gas companies get billions of dollars in tax breaks,” said Senator , Democrat of and chairman of the finance committee. “Now is the time to take concrete steps toward cleaner, more affordable, domestically produced energy.”The measure could well pass in the Democratic Senate, although some Democrats from oil-producing states, like of and of , are likely to oppose it.But it has little chance of even coming to a vote in the Republican-run House, where Speaker Boehner is orchestrating a fresh chorus of “drill, baby, drill” with a series of votes on bills to allow new oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of .“Our goal is to expand the supply of American energy to lower gas prices and create jobs,” said Michael Steel, spokesman for Mr. Boehner. “Raising taxes would have the opposite effect.”Neither the Senate tax measure nor the House drilling bills is likely to become law because of the fierce partisan calculus of the current Congress. But some Republicans, including Representative of , the party’s leader on budget matters, have left open the door for rethinking a range of government tax breaks as part of an agreement on the and deficit ceiling.Some conservatives oppose energy subsidies of all sorts — including those for ethanol, wind, nuclear and — and would be willing to see them all repealed as part of a reform of the business tax code.Oil industry tax breaks — some of them dating back a century — have been debated for years but have survived every elimination attempt. According to a breakdown by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, oil companies receive about $4 billion a year in federal subsidies and can avail themselves of tax breaks at virtually every stage of the prospecting and drilling process.One lingering provision from the Tariff Act of 1913 — enacted to encourage exploration at a time when drilling often led to dry holes — allows many small and midsize oil companies to claim deductions for tapped oil fields far beyond the amount the companies actually paid for them.Another subsidy, devised by the State Department in the 1950s, allows U.S.-based oil companies to reclassify the royalties they are charged by foreign governments as taxes — which can be deducted dollar-for-dollar from their domestic tax bill. That provision alone will cost the federal government $8.2 billion over the next decade, according to the department.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — In what was characterized as a victory for business, the Treasury Department proposed on Friday that commonly used foreign exchange swaps and forwards should be exempted from rules intended to tighten oversight of other derivatives.The Treasury said that forcing these derivatives through clearinghouses and onto exchanges was not necessary because existing procedures in the foreign exchange market mitigate risk and ensure stability.Any disruptions to the market “could have serious negative economic consequences,” the department said.Foreign exchange swaps and forwards, which represent about 5 percent of the $600 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market, are used to lock in prices as protection against exchange rate fluctuations.Businesses, big banks and the securities industry lobbied the administration to exempt the financial instruments from the rules. They argued that clearing requirements were unnecessary given that most contracts expired after one week.'"
"'11-04-30,'0','“Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,” the European Union competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said in a statement. “I hope our investigation will contribute to a better functioning of financial markets and, therefore, to more sustainable recovery.”Antitrust rules in Europe tend to be tougher in these types of cases than in the United States, experts said, and the efforts in Europe may increase the pressure on Washington to open this marketplace up to more competition. The investigations also differ from other prominent antitrust cases recently because they involve many big players in the industry, rather than a single company, and the outcome will be determined by laws covering collusion rather than monopolies.“Our big time, famous antitrust cases over the past couple years have involved a single dominant firm, like Microsoft,” said Keith N. Hylton, a professor of law at Boston University. “This is a story of a secretive group that controls the market and they’re excluding competitors.”The result of the investigations could affect broad swaths of the economy, because banks dominate the market for many sorts of derivatives, not just credit-default swaps.As in Europe, American regulators have expressed worries that buyers are paying higher prices for these complex instruments than they would in a more competitive market. That can affect products like airline tickets that include the cost of hedges on oil prices or local tax bills that reflect the fees cities pay to manage the risk of swings in interest rates.The investigation announced on Friday was twofold.One part focuses on a larger set of banks — 16 in total — that work with a data provider called the Markit Group, based in London, designing pricing procedures and indices related to these swaps. Many of the banks also hold stakes in Markit.Markit, which the European regulators are also looking at, said in a statement that it “has no exclusive arrangements with any data provider and makes its data and related products widely available to global market participants.” And, the company said, it was “unaware of any collusion by other market participants as described by the commission.”The second part of the investigation centers on nine banks that play a major role in a procedure called clearing that regulators in the United States and Europe have promoted for several years as a better way to manage the risks posed by derivatives.The nine banks gained power in part through regulators’ efforts in 2008 to improve transparency in the market. At the time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ordered the banks to help build clearing houses for derivatives.In return for partnering with the Intercontinental Exchange, a publicly traded company, the banks got a favorable deal with ICE that persists today. Not only did they get a major say in ICE’s rules on derivatives, the banks also share in ICE’s profits from clearing and enjoy a cap on the fees they pay for clearing.The European Commission said the deal between ICE and the nine banks might be unfair to other players in the market. In particular, the commission criticized the cap on clearing fees. The banks are not obligated to pass on the benefits of the caps to their customers and could use part of their savings to undercut bids from new competitors.“This could potentially constitute an abuse of a dominant position by ICE,” the commission said in a statement.ICE declined to comment. But officials inside the banks say privately they are entitled to the caps on the fees at ICE because as part of their partnership, they sold a jointly owned clearing business to ICE. The caps, they argue, are part of the payment for that deal.Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington said on Friday that the department’s investigation of the derivatives market was still underway. Last fall, she said the department was focused on “the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries.”Also late last year, Christine A. Varney, assistant attorney general in the department’s antitrust division, urged the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create regulations that spur more competition in the derivatives market.The banks named in the ICE clearing investigation are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. In addition to those nine, the Markit inquiry also includes Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale.'"
