"'09-11-01,'0','LOS ANGELES — Rescue teams continued searching on Saturday for seven Coast Guard members and two Marines whose aircraft collided off the coast of San Diego on Thursday night.The operation, over 644 square miles of ocean, was still being considered “a search and rescue effort,” said Officer Henry Dunphy, a Coast Guard spokesman. He said that rescue teams were focusing on about 50 miles of floating debris off the coast of San Clemente Island, a staging area for military training drills.The crash Thursday involved a Coast Guard C-130 transport plane carrying seven crew members heading south from Sacramento and a Marine Corps AH-1W Super Cobra with a two-man crew.The names of all nine people — eight men and one woman — were released Saturday, as their family members gathered to wait for news of their loved ones. Jennifer Wiegandt Seidman, the wife of Chief Petty Officer John Seidman, 43, a flight engineer on the Coast Guard plane, left her home in Carmichael, Calif., on Saturday afternoon with Mr. Seidman’s parents and brother to wait for news at the Coast Guard base in Sacramento.“I want to look at a map, ask some questions and be with the other families,” said Ms. Seidman, 38, who said she believed her husband was still alive. “If we’re together, we can all kind of support each other.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','The timing of The Times’s latest cuts came as a surprise. Bill Keller, the executive editor, said that after 100 buyouts and layoffs at the start of last year and a temporary 5 percent pay cut for everyone this year, he had hoped to avoid further staffing reductions until next year. But he said that under the contract with the Newspaper Guild, the newsroom union, members leaving the company after Jan. 1 would have been entitled to a full year’s vacation pay. With advertising revenue still falling, that would have meant 10 more buyouts or layoffs to meet the budget.Keller said he is determined to avoid closing foreign or national bureaus and does not expect significant cuts in Washington. “Washington, news-wise, is the center of the universe at the moment,” Keller said. He said editors are studying the flow of news copy to see if some editing slots can be eliminated, and they will look at the 70 blogs on the paper’s Web site to see if any are not justifying themselves. More radical moves, like dropping the sports section, have been rejected because they would undermine the quality of The Times or would not save much money, Keller said.The Times has already made the easier decisions — reducing the support staff, cutting freelance budgets, capping expense-account meals, seeking bargain airfares and hotels, rotating foreign correspondents every five years instead of four, and housing some bureaus in correspondents’ homes rather than downtown offices. The nice car and driver for the bureau chief? History.William Schmidt, the deputy managing editor in charge of the newsroom budget, said editors are focused on preserving core coverage: national, foreign, business, and culture and arts. Over the past 10 years, the paper has added seven national correspondents and 10 foreign correspondents, and has expanded the Washington bureau and the business news department. The paper is spending more than $4 million a year to feed, house and protect its journalists in war zones, Schmidt said.Meanwhile, the metro staff, with more than 60 reporters, is still the largest, but it has been reduced by nearly 20 percent over a decade. The paper, for example, no longer has correspondents in the state capitals of and .Technology, which has led to the flight of readers and advertisers from print, has also drastically reshaped the newsroom. For instance, there is no longer a photo lab with a dozen technicians developing film, but there are a dozen videographers shooting for the Web site.Still, newsroom managers say the changes offer hope for savings in some areas, like the editing process. Susan Edgerley, an assistant managing editor in charge of figuring out more efficient copy flow, said that when she started at The Times as a copy editor 20 years ago, she had little to do — like those reporters waiting around in 1954 — until the 9 p.m. deadline, when most of the copy for the next day’s paper landed at once. Copy editors were suddenly swamped, and the potential for mistakes was high.Now, with an around-the-clock news cycle, reporters file throughout the day, and copy can be edited over a smoother cycle, she said. That is the goal, but the editing staff is dealing with much more copy than before, some online articles are now read by a single editor instead of four or five, and I hear regularly from readers complaining about errors in grammar, spelling and word usage.When the latest cuts were announced, hundreds of readers thought they had a better answer: charge online readers. “I have my credit card ready,” wrote Anne Hills of Windham, . Cullen Howe of said, “Why not go this route rather than enact cuts that will certainly affect the quality of the reporting?”Scott Heekin-Canedy, the newspaper’s president and general manager, told me in June that a decision about charging online readers would be made by late summer. But he said last week that executives were still studying the issue. Lauren Rich Fine, a professor at and a former analyst of media companies for , said The Times should move ahead with charging for at least some online content. Delaying, she said, is “not smart.”Keller said: “It’s a much tougher, more complicated decision than it seems to all the armchair experts. There is no clear consensus on the right way to go.” At stake are millions of dollars from online advertisers who want the largest possible number of readers. Putting up any kind of pay wall has the potential to drive away readers and some of those dollars.Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher, said the newsroom cuts and a decision about charging online readers are entirely separate issues. The cuts are “meant to address the immediate, short-term realities of our current economic situation.” Charging for online content, he said, is a strategic issue that “would have little or no impact on our financial results in the short term, but rather position us differently for long-term growth.”Stay tuned. Keller said his guess is, “We’re within weeks of a decision.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','Until recently, Chevron had been doing well. The second-largest oil company in the United States, it earned $23.9 billion last year, topping off five consecutive years of record profits. Though Friday’s third quarter earnings report showed profits down 51 percent, Ms. McLaughlin still brandishes Chevron’s financial statements like weapons.They contrast starkly with the poverty in this city, which has an unemployment rate of 18 percent and the third-highest crime rate per capita in the state.“It always seems really obscene to me that we have such growing profits experienced by this large oil company while people here are struggling to pay for food and rent for their families,” the mayor said in an interview .A series of lawsuits and a key ballot measure passed since Ms. McLaughlin’s victory show a city torn between the generally liberal, anticorporate politics of the Bay Area and its own history as a loyal company town. Environmental groups have so far been able to block a retrofit of the Chevron refinery while the city has tried to raise the company’s taxes. Chevron, which says the changes to the refinery will reduce pollution, has appealed the ruling.The taxes paid by the Richmond refinery account for 33 percent to 50 percent of the city’s $144 million general budget this year. The refinery employs some 1,300 people, making it unclear what the city would do without Chevron.But between the low profit margins for refineries across the country and the new taxes levied on the refinery, company leaders say they are considering doing without Richmond. While residents might not want anything that drastic, they do seem to want the corporation to do more for the city. Last fall, they passed a ballot initiative, Measure T, whose backers adopted the slogan “A Fair Share for Richmond.”The measure charged businesses an additional tax of a quarter-percent of the value of the raw materials used in manufacturing. For Chevron, that additional tax was $21 million this year. In February the company filed suit in Contra Costa County Superior Court arguing that the measure violated state and federal law.The suit remains unresolved, but Chevron paid the additional $21 million in April. The city kept the money, though it refrained from spending it after the judge in the case warned not to. In February the company also agreed to pay the city $28 million as part of a legal settlement after a city audit concluded that the refinery had underpaid utility taxes.Then, in July, another county judge halted Chevron’s effort to retrofit the refinery, saying the company’s environmental review was unclear on a crucial issue: whether the upgrade was designed to process a heavier grade of crude oil.Lawyers for the nonprofit environmental groups who filed the suit claimed that the use of “dirtier crude” would result in more toxic air pollution and greater danger in the case of an oil spill.While many residents and community leaders are happy with the status quo and grateful for the city’s economic engine, others celebrate the campaign against Chevron.“We will not accept the ongoing chemical assault on our people,” said Dr. Henry Clark, executive director of West County Toxics Coalition, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and an organization that has long insisted that the health of area residents suffers from pollution emitted by the five refineries in the Bay Area.The combination of delays in construction that could improve profits and a fight over taxes that could hurt them are likely to influence the company’s decision whether to stay in the spot where Chevron has been since 1902.The company does not disclose profit figures for individual refineries, but Mike Wirth, a Chevron executive vice president, said Richmond was in the “lowest tier of earnings,” thanks in part to its city and state tax bills. “The government makes more money on the Richmond refinery than Chevron does,” Mr. Wirth said.“We want to be a good partner with the city, but we also have the reality that this facility needs to be competitive and viable,” said Mr. Wirth, adding that the site must compete with other, less regulated and taxed locales like Singapore, China and India.“Refineries that don’t make money don’t stay open,” he said.Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones, said: “Refining is a tough business right now with more refineries coming on line in places like China and an economic slump driving demand down. Profitability in refining is the lowest it has been in years.”Closing the Richmond refinery would probably result in higher gasoline prices on the West Coast, Mr. Youngberg said.Though the threat of closing is a nerve-racking backdrop for the city’s tussles with the oil giant, nothing is imminent. For now, Chevron is working hard to ease the tensions in Richmond and win over the city’s residents.At the end of last year, the company hired a consultant to discover the root of residents’ discontent with the refinery. With those survey results in hand, this year the company will spend $3 million— double what it spent in 2008— to support nonprofits, volunteer efforts and job training programs in the city. In an effort to demystify what goes on behind its gates, the refinery will also offer more public tours.A flood of employee volunteers, wearing brightly colored Chevron T-shirts, has poured into city schools, parks and soup kitchens. To communicate its message directly to residents, the refinery went digital with its own Twitter account, Facebook page and YouTube videos.Ms. McLaughlin said she viewed her struggle against Chevron not just as a local issue, but also as a global one. “We have solidarity with communities in Nigeria and indigenous folks in Ecuador who are also going up against Chevron for destroying their home in the Amazon,” she said referring to the $27 billion Ecuadorean lawsuit against Chevron.For its part, Ms. McLaughlin said, Richmond is now “a city that is growing in its awareness of its own empowerment.”In the midst of the hyperbole, much remains in flux: whether a judge will rule that the city can start spending the $21 million from Chevron in Measure T taxes, whether Chevron wins its appeal and completes construction on the refinery upgrade, whether the company will win over enough city residents by next fall to thwart Ms. McLaughlin’s re-election.On the map of Chevron’s global operations, Richmond clearly remains, if not a sore spot, at least a problematic venue. Mr. Wirth, of Chevron, said he traveled around the world meeting with local officials where the company operates.“Our relationships are stronger in some areas and more a work in progress in others,” he said. “Richmond is a work in progress.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','Companies that exceed their carbon dioxide emission allowances could buy credits from those that pollute less. Under such a system, a coal plant that had exceeded its allotment might pay a chemical plant that could separate a ton of carbon dioxide more cheaply.“If we have a cap-and-trade scheme, it will happen wherever it is the most cost-effective,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, a lawyer and former assistant administrator for air and radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.Lending momentum to this thinking, a Texas company, Denbury Resources, is building a 320-mile pipeline for carbon dioxide that will run from Louisiana to Houston.Initially the pipeline will take natural underground deposits of carbon dioxide in Mississippi to the aging oil fields of east Texas, where it can be used to force more oil to the surface.But as the pipeline threads its way through more and more refineries and plants — the chemical heartland of the United States — manmade carbon dioxide captured at those sites could also be added and stored.Sequestering a ton of carbon dioxide from a chemical plant would have the same effect on the Earth’s atmosphere as storing a ton from a coal plant, scientists and industry executives emphasize.“Sequestration is not a coal technology — it is a greenhouse gas abatement strategy,” said S. Julio Friedmann, leader of the carbon management program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Last month, the Energy Department announced $44 million in grants to develop the technology, known generally as carbon capture.Among them was $1.72 million for Praxair, a chemical company based in Connecticut that operates two plants near Houston that make hydrogen for use in oil refineries.The money will go toward developing engineering studies on how to capture carbon dioxide from the hydrogen production and deliver it to Denbury.Carbon dioxide makes up 20 percent of the gas resulting from hydrogen production, twice the concentration found in a gas stream from a typical coal plant. Recovering it from this stream rather than a coal plant smokestack would therefore be cheaper and simpler.In the oil industry, drillers have for years tapped underground reservoirs of carbon dioxide, brought it to the surface and moved it by pipeline to oil fields. Then they inject it into the fields to help force oil to the surface in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.”If the oil industry left the natural carbon dioxide where it was, and drew on carbon dioxide from industrial plants instead, far less manmade carbon dioxide would enter the atmosphere, experts say.What oil drillers pay for carbon dioxide depends on the value of the oil it will help produce. When oil is at $70 a barrel, carbon dioxide goes for $10 or $11 a ton, said Tracy Evans, the chief executive of Denbury, the Texas company building the carbon dioxide pipeline.Should the Congressional legislation mandate a cap-and-trade system, that modest price could be very important. “Wherever you can go to store a ton of carbon the most cheaply, you will go,” said Mr. Holmstead, the former E.P.A. administrator for air.Another likely source of pure streams of carbon dioxide are plants that refine natural gas. The natural gas usually comes out of the ground mixed with carbon dioxide, which natural gas sellers routinely remove so the natural gas can be considered “pipeline quality.” That carbon dioxide is sometimes reinjected into the ground, but sometimes vented.Then there are cement kilns, which produce a nearly pure stream of carbon dioxide.For now, no one is sure what it will cost to capture and sequester carbon dioxide from coal plants because the first such project in the nation, at American Electric Power’s coal-fired plant in New Haven, W.Va., got under way only last month. At the moment, the process consumes 30 percent of the coal plant’s energy, but engineers are working to cut that in half.Even so, experts expect the price to run to $60 a ton or more. But pure streams could be captured for the cost of drilling a natural gas well and compressing the gas into liquid form — perhaps $10 to $15 a ton, Dr. Friedmann of the Livermore laboratory said.Bruce Nilles, director of the National Coal Campaign at the Sierra Club, also cites natural gas plants as a promising avenue for carbon capture. Natural gas has only half as much carbon dioxide in it as coal does. So the equipment needed to separate and sequester the carbon dioxide at a gas plant would be half as big as the machinery at a coal plant of the same size, and would cost less to build and operate.Mr. Nilles and others say that biomass fuels, derived from wood, waste and alcohol, could offer an even better opportunity for carbon capture. If an electric plant burns wood chips or other plant material in place of coal, it produces a stream of smoke from which carbon dioxide can be taken and then injected deep into the earth.The advantage is that if a tree is cut down and burned in a boiler, a new tree can grow in its place, and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That makes the process “carbon negative;” for each ton burned, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will decline.Eventually, Mr. Evans of Denbury said, most of the carbon sequestration will come from the power sector, because it is a far larger emitter than the chemical or refining sectors.But for the moment, he said, for companies like his, which use carbon dioxide to drill for oil, there is something of a shortage. His company is still drilling for natural deposits of carbon dioxide, he said, and “we don’t have any to sell to others.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','Knowthyneighbor.org, one of the groups, in the past has posted on the Web the names of petition signers in Arkansas, Florida and Massachusetts.Signing a petition, these groups say, can be a step toward making law, and in fact, many ballot measures are intended to bypass or override the legislative process. That argument echoes one made by the Washington secretary of state’s office, which was barred by the courts from releasing the names even though the state’s public records law does not exempt the signatures from release; the office has released names of petition signers on other ballot measures in the past.“Our disclosure law demands that we know who’s influencing the legislative process,” said David Ammons, a spokesman for Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican.Opponents of releasing the names, led by Protect Marriage Washington, the group behind the referendum, say gay rights groups are threatening free speech by intimidating petition signers. James Bopp Jr., the lead lawyer for the group, filed affidavits from people who said they felt threatened for taking their position on the issue. Larry Stickney, the campaign manager of Protect Marriage Washington, has also complained of feeling threatened, he said.“He has his children sleep in the hall of the middle of the house so they won’t be exposed to the street,” Mr. Bopp said.Opponents note that until recently Washington, as a practice, did not release names of petition signers. State officials said the policy changed about a decade ago after a review of the public records act. In many states, petition signatures are often considered public records and many private firms and the national political parties have used them to build databases for voter outreach. The practice has become more common as states have become able to provide the information in digital form.In Washington State, a DVD with scanned images of signed petitions costs $25, but the laborious task of entering the names into a database is left to the buyer. In recent years, the state has received requests for copies of petition signatures from groups including real estate agents, teachers and a state conservative activist, Tim Eyman, who regularly leads antitax initiatives.Mr. Eyman did not follow through on those early requests, but Mr. Ammons said state records showed that a paid signature gatherer for Mr. Eyman has requested and received copies of petitions. Mr. Eyman is now part of a separate case in state court in which he is trying to keep signatures on his petitions private.The Supreme Court has ruled in cases involving disclosure and petitions in the past, but it has not directly addressed whether names of signers should be kept private. And, said Richard L. Hasen, a professor specializing in election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, “It’s never really confronted how the Internet changes the calculus.”As Eugene Volokh, a professor specializing in First Amendment issues at the University of California, Los Angeles, law school, put it, “Now, public access really is public access.”Mr. Volokh said that the “talk of retaliation” had added complexity to the Washington case and raised the question of whether, if the names are disclosed, “you’re really not going to get an accurate measure of public sentiment” because people will become reluctant to sign petitions. He said confrontation had been a theme in other gay rights campaigns, including in California last year with Proposition 8, whose passage outlawed same-sex marriage there.Concerns about intimidation and free speech have been raised in other states where knowthyneighbor.org has posted signatures. Tom Lang, the group’s co-director, said some gay rights organizations had distanced themselves from his work “because they understand the provocative nature of what we do.”Created in 2005 amid the fight over same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, the Web site was founded on a belief that “for social change to happen, there has to be a shaming part,” Mr. Lang said. Discussion, not intimidation, is the goal, he said.“I’m trying to get you to understand that if you’re going to try to take away my rights I want you to know what you’re doing,” he said. “In Washington you’re being deprived of that.”Arline Isaacson, a lobbyist who is co-chairwoman of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, said her group first posted petition signers’ names on the Internet as far back as 2001, when the idea was solely to serve as a check against fraud in signature gathering.Ms. Isaacson now supports the way knowthyneighbor.org uses the signatures. She noted that the petition process was layered with various stages of public access, from the moment a signature gatherer engages with a potential signer, to the private databases those gatherers might build with the information, to the state validation process, which is often observed by advocates on various sides of whatever issue is at hand.“These names were never meant to be private,” Ms. Isaacson said. “It’s just that people never took advantage of it before.”John Matsusaka, head of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, said the debate was so new that its broad implications remained unclear.“It’s the Internet,” he said, “that you can put all this stuff online, that’s now making it much more potent.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','In September, the Army announced that it would spend $300,000 to study the impact of pairing psychiatric service dogs like Jet with soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder. Both the House and Senate have recently passed bills that would finance the training and placement of these dogs with veterans.Hungarian researchers reported in a study last year that a guide dog for a blind and epileptic person became anxious before its master suffered a seizure and was taught to bark and lick the owner’s face and upper arm when it detected an onset, three to five minutes before the seizure. It is still somewhat mysterious how exactly dogs detect seizures, whether it’s by picking up on behavioral changes or smelling something awry, but several small studies have shown that a powerful sense of smell can detect lung and other types of cancer, as the dogs sniff out odors emitted by the disease.Beyond these perceptual abilities, in which trainers can use the dogs’ natural instincts, some research has examined dogs’ actual cognitive ability, and found not just good doggie, but smart doggie.“I believe that so much research has come out lately suggesting that we may have underestimated certain aspects of the mental ability of dogs that even the most hardened cynic has to think twice before rejecting the possibilities,” said Stanley Coren, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and an author of several books on dogs.Dr. Coren’s work on intelligence, along with other research suggesting that the canine brain processes information something like the way people do, has drawn criticism. And there is good reason. For most of the last century the specter of a horse named Clever Hans hung over anyone who tried to prove that dogs were acting in thoughtful ways — not merely mimicking or manipulating people into believing that they in fact grasped human concepts.Clever Hans was said to be able to count, make change and tell time by tapping his hoof, until investigators in the early 1900s learned that Hans was merely responding to his trainer’s body language, tapping when the trainer nodded his head. This provided an enduring example for those who believed thought was the exclusive domain of humans.But in 2004, German researchers reported that a border collie named Rico could learn the name of an object in one try, had 200 objects in his repertoire and remembered them all a month later, all very human. Even skeptical animal behavior researchers found the Rico results impressive and sound. Is it possible that Rico turned the tide on the Clever Hans problem, even though there is debate about how we can reliably measure what dogs know?By giving dogs language learning and other tests devised for infants and toddlers, Dr. Coren has come up with an intelligence ranking of 100 breeds, with border collies at No. 1. He says the most intelligent breeds (poodles, retrievers, Labradors and shepherds) can learn as many as 250 words, signs and signals, while the others can learn 165. The average dog is about as intellectually advanced as a 2- to 2-and-a-half-year-old child, he has concluded, with an ability to understand some abstract concepts. For example, the animal can get “the idea of being a dog” by differentiating photographs with dogs in them from photographs without dogs.But Clive D. L. Wynne, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Florida who specializes in canine cognition and has himself said he met a border collie who knew 1,500 words, takes issue with efforts to compare human and canine brains.He argues that it is dogs’ deep sensitivity to the humans around them, their obedience under rigorous training, and their desire to please that can explain most of these capabilities. They may be deft at reading human cues — and teachable — but that doesn’t mean they are thinking like people, he says. A dog’s entire world revolves around its primary owner, and it will respond to that person to get what it wants, usually food, treats or affection.“I take the view that dogs have their own unique way of thinking,” Dr. Wynne said. “It’s a happy accident that doggie thinking and human thinking overlap enough that we can have these relationships with dogs, but we shouldn’t kid ourselves that dogs are viewing the world the way we do.”'"

"'09-11-01,'0','The exhibition by Avital Oz at Art Sites in Riverhead, a powerful, rambling display of almost 50 pieces in metal, stone, wood, rubber and other materials, not only contains many fine works, it also gives us an overview of the artist’s career, spanning the last 40 years.Organizing such a complex and demanding show, on view in the gallery and outdoors across a two-acre site, is ambitious, especially given that some of the pieces weigh several tons and required the use of cranes to move. Mr. Oz, a resident of Westhampton since 1982, installed the exhibition gradually over several months’ time.The hard work was worth it, for Mr. Oz has proven that minimal abstract sculpture is far from defunct and that artists continue to make interesting and innovative work in this vein. He has also proved himself to be an unjustly overlooked artist.Art history has not been kind to those like Mr. Oz who retained an enthusiasm for the formal elements of art — like shape, scale and composition — when sculpture took a radical turn in the 1960s toward the embrace of consumer objects and urban detritus.Born in 1942, in what was then the British mandate of Palestine, Mr. Oz studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York in the 1960s. He was befriended by Sol LeWitt, who was so impressed with the young artist that during one of his own exhibitions at a SoHo gallery he gave up two weeks to display Mr. Oz’s work. For an artist, it was an extremely generous gesture of support.'"

"'09-11-01,'0','All my life, my parents' defiance of the Communists, their stubborn courage as the last independent journalists behind the Iron Curtain until their arrest, trial, and conviction as CIA spies, has been at the core of our family identity. On February 25, 1955, at two in the morning, following a game of bridge at the home of the United States military attaché, my father was abducted by six agents of the secret police. His arrest was front-page news in The New York Times. Four months later, they came for my mother. The following January, almost a year later, The New York Times, in another front-page story, reported that ""Endre Marton, a correspondent for the Associated Press in communist ruled Hungary, has been sentenced to six years in prison on a charge of espionage. His wife, Ilona, who worked for United Press was sentenced to three years ... The Martons have two young daughters, Kati and Juli."" Accompanying the article was a photograph of a handsome, elegant couple and their smiling little girls, a happy family, self-contained and seemingly indestructible, on our last Christmas together in Hungary, before everything changed. Thus did I make my debut in the press, although I did not see the story until decades later.My parents were forward-looking people. They looked back only selectively. When, toward the end of his life, my father was given Hungary's highest civilian award from the foreign minister of a free and democratic Hungary, he did not come to New York to receive it in person, leaving it to me to accept for him. That evening, the foreign minister surprised me with a large manila envelope containing AVO material on Papa. My father never opened that file; he was done with all that. To him, history — at least his history — was a burden. For me, it was the beginning of my search.It has been said that childhood is a foreign land. This is especially so if the child is uprooted early from that small universe where all is familiar, and transplanted to a country where no one knows how to pronounce her name. After my parents both died — my mother in 2004 and my father the following year — I became obsessed with learning everything I could about what precisely had happened to them and to my sister and me in the land where everything began. No subsequent chapter in my life had matched those Budapest years for intensity and the power of family love. My parents and sister and I formed a tight unit partly because the world outside was hostile. Once safe in America, each of us would pursue our own lives, and our family ties inevitably loosened. We had successfully made the crossing. Strangely, I still longed for a time that had been dangerous and painful for all of us — yet had bound us together. I missed the closeness of our lives in Budapest.A child growing up in a State built on terror learns early that she, and even her parents, is nothing compared to the power of that State. However accomplished or witty or glamorous the parents — and mine were all of those things — they were playthings in the hands of the State. In such a place a child has no rights, not even the right to her parents. So when they were taken from me — and this is how it seemed to a child, they were taken from me — a separation marked me, not just them, and forever. I wanted to open the files in order to put that trauma to rest.There was something else that puzzled me as the files disgorged secrets. Why did my parents take such risks? During the Cold War, most Hungarians would cross a street rather than risk being seen greeting an American. But my parents' best friends were American diplomats and journalists. What every grown-up I knew whispered, my parents spoke out loud. At a time when there were roughly two thousand private cars in all of Hungary, our family drove a white Studebaker convertible! We might as well have ridden a rocket.So, when some years later I, too, received the same award from the Hungarian government as my father, I returned to Budapest, to this stately house of horrors, and filled out all the requisite forms. For several months I waited in New York to be summoned by the head of these archives, Katalin Kutrucz.Periodically moistening her finger, Katalin, as I am now encouraged to call her, flips through the hundreds of pages of our family file. She is familiar with their contents. As the pages fly by, names from my childhood unspool. Even more names are inside quotation marks, code names for informers. Reading my thoughts, Katalin says, ""Everybody in your circle, whether your parents trusted or did not trust them, was informing on them. That was just the way it was."" She shrugs. Flipping through a series of reports under code name ""Gaspar,"" I am struck by the frequency of my name and my sister, Julia's. I do not want to risk losing these pages amid the thousands, so I place a hand on hers. ""Please."" She pauses for a moment. ""These are all yours. You can take them and do what you like with them."" As if to say, ""We are a different country now!"" But I can't wait. Who is this energetic informer ""Gaspar"" and why her constant reference to two little girls? ""Well,"" Katalin answers, pursing her lips, ""I am not allowed to inform you of such things, the actual names of agents. But I will tell you this: the code usually has some connection to the real name."" Gaspar. Of course. Gabrielle. Our French nanny! A zealous agent, to judge by her contribution to the file. Along with anger I feel some vindication. I never liked her, and it was mutual. I can still hear the clop, clop, of her high heels every morning as she reached for the venetian blinds directly over my head, raising them with maximum clatter, while calling out in her shrill high-pitched voice, ""Levez-vous, mes enfants!"" No wonder she was always in a hurry. She had more important business.Out of another file falls artwork by my sister and me: a house with a smoking chimney, and birds the size of people strolling in the foreground, and another with a long row of snails climbing a hill, with the inscription, ""Mamikanak,"" ""To Mommy."" Another stick figure drawing is inscribed with handwriting I recognize as my grandmother's. ""Kati did this and she isn't even in school yet!"" And, more chillingly, shots of my parents, clearly caught unawares on a street, by a telephoto lens. I am struck that, even though oblivious to the camera's intrusive eye, my father is ramrod straight, his face composed, his expression inscrutable. A man who, having barely survived the Nazis, was caught again on the losing side, wearing protective armor against the outside world. But no armor could protect him from a State that collected his children's artwork.But now my guide is speeding forward. A new file with the letter ""B"" in bold on the cover. I know by now that ""B"" stands for Beszervezes, ""agent recruitment"" for the secret police. ""Izorche"" is the code name on this one. ""That, I can tell you, was your father's code name."" My mouth is too dry to speak. How dare she imply such a thing! So this was the reason for the compassion that was absent at our first meeting and her warning to come alone. The date on the last report in my father's recruitment file is 1967. This is impossible — by 1967 we were living in America. We were safe. Or so I have always assumed.But I don't want to argue with her that this is ludicrous — two people who resisted the all-powerful AVO in its own territory? How could they imagine my parents would be Beszervezes material, once they were safely in the United States?Closing the last file, she turns to me. ""These are all yours,"" she says, with the practiced sympathy of a doctor breaking bad news. ""But do not judge them,"" she warns, ""judge the system."" She retrieves a photograph that dropped out of the files. A curly-haired child, three or four, wearing a bib with butterflies and cherries on it, and holding a spoon. A chubby, earnest, unsmiling child whom I recognize as my younger self. I recall the historian's warning, ""You are opening a Pandora's box.""'"
"'09-11-01,'0','Ms. Prince, 66, an owner of Julia B. Fee Real Estate before it was acquired by Sotheby’s in 2006, said she had selected well-connected younger team members who could generate new listings.Wendy Alper, the youngest member, has two children at Purchase Elementary School and says she fishes for leads at Little League soccer and baseball games and in the car pickup lane on weekday afternoons waiting for her children.“A lot of schmoozing goes on in that parking lot,” said Ms. Alper, 41, who was a television producer before going into real estate two years ago. “This is a group that’s still having babies, which means they’re often in the market for a bigger house.”Gayle Bronstein, a White Plains resident whose children are grown, said the group had appealed to her because she was new to the business, needed a mentor and wanted to share in the cachet of Alix Prince’s name. For her part, Ms. Prince said she had hired Ms. Bronstein in part because of her background in interior design, which is especially helpful when staging a house to go on the market.The remaining team member, Micheline Madorsky, a Purchase resident with experience in corporate marketing, noted that the full-time availability of a broker was a strong selling point with clients.Indeed, many sellers with only one agent worry about getting lost in the shuffle, said Elaine Clayman, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan who oversees an eight-member team, one of the first formed in the New York area.“Clients tell me, ‘I met the broker, I liked the broker, but I never heard from the broker again,’ ” said Ms. Clayman, who started her team almost a decade ago and often serves as a role model for newer team leaders. “Someone should always be available to hold the client’s hand.”That prerequisite prompted four sales agents in Larchmont earlier this year to start Realtors 4, a team within Weichert Capital Properties and Estates. “Even though two of us usually get the better listings and other two are better as buyer’s reps,” said Tom McGuire, one team member, “at least one of us is always available for a client, whatever they need at the moment.”Each of the Realtors 4 members became an agent after retiring from another career within the last five years. Their former jobs were in health care administration, secondary education, construction and sales.Unlike the Alix Prince Team, they “split everything evenly” and work without a contract, said Mr. McGuire, the former health administrator. “It’s a trust relationship and difficult to pin down in a contract. We did look at other teams and other agencies, but there weren’t a lot of models to follow.”At the offices of Keller Williams Realty in White Plains, Christine Ricci is the business owner and rainmaker for the Ricci Team, which consists of two buyers’ agents, an executive assistant, a part-time marketing coordinator and a part-time bookkeeper. “We try to have very clearly designated positions to avoid juggling too many balls,” said Ms. Ricci, who started her group three years ago.Ms. Ricci’s decision was informed by an awareness of the pitfalls inherent in the team approach.Ralph R. Roberts, author of a book on the subject called “Power Teams” (RISMedia), explained the potential problems. “The big deal is keeping egos in check,” he said. “You have to remember that some people are good at making rain, but not good at crossing their t’s and dotting their i’s. Not everybody can do everything well, so that’s where the team comes in.”Mr. Roberts, who is also a real estate coach and an agent in Sterling Heights, Mich., north of Detroit, acknowledged that team members might not make as much money per deal as they would have working alone. “But especially in this economy,” he said, “you also should not forget that it’s better to share at least a little piece of the pie than none at all.”Although the number of real estate teams is increasing nationwide, only 9 percent of National Association of Realtors members belong to one, said Stephanie Singer, a spokeswoman for the trade group, whose Web site publishes a field guide for starting and running teams. The County Board of Realtors does not keep records on the number of teams in Westchester.'"
"'09-11-01,'0','“This is the Grey Gardens of the Chateau,” said the broker, Michael P. Carfagna of MPC Properties. “Shabby chic,” he added with a smile.The apartment has high ceilings, lots of light, a working fireplace, and nice original detail. But the floors need to be sanded and polished, the electrical wiring updated and the bathrooms and kitchen gutted. The walls, covered in a variety of elaborate wallpaper, also need work.This apartment is on the second floor of the six-story building. The same size apartment in better condition on the floor below sold in May for $645,000.According to Mr. Carfagna, who was the listing agent on that apartment as well, the higher-priced unit was renovated with high-end finishes about 10 years ago and has been well maintained since. The people who bought that place, he says, saw the cheaper one upstairs but decided against the hassle of a big project.Rick Wohlfarth, the president of the real estate brokerage Wohlfarth & Associates in Manhattan, says most of his clients aren’t interested in renovating.“There are those groups who are willing to pay a little extra to just move in and put out their toothbrush,” Mr. Wohlfarth said. “That is the easiest way to sell an apartment in New York City, the most expeditious way. Then you have the other group of buyers who really enjoy projects.”He has a listing at 789 West End Avenue: a two-bedroom one-bathroom apartment, which will soon come on the market for $899,000. The unit, No. 12B, has views of the Hudson River and great bones, like high ceilings and solid prewar construction, but it looks as if it hadn’t been touched in decades and is badly in need of renovation.The electrical system needs to be updated, the floors buffed, the walls repaired and the bathroom gutted. The kitchen, which also looks “prewar,” needs a total overhaul.To price a fixer-upper apartment like this one, Mr. Wohlfarth said, you start the way you would price any home, by looking at comparable apartments.A report generated by Streeteasy.com, a Web site that tracks listing data, shows that the average asking price for two-bedroom apartments on the Upper West Side is $1.1 million.Then, Mr. Wohlfarth said, he deducts the renovation costs.But those costs can vary significantly, and so can the discount that brokers factor in on apartments needing work. Buyers might break even — spending the same amount after renovations that they would have to purchase an apartment in move-in condition — or they might save some money.Karen and Christian Brooks recently closed on a one-bedroom in Gramercy that needs a new kitchen, a new bathroom and perhaps new floors as well. Even with the renovation cost, they expect to spend less money than they would have if they had bought a home that was ready to go.“When we were going to see apartments,” Ms. Brooks said, “the renovated ones were going at a premium. And they were nice, but it was always the case that I wouldn’t have picked that countertop, or it was a different type of style than I might go for.”They are waiting to hear back on bids from contractors, but they have been given some quotations on cabinets, and, Ms. Brooks says, they were lower than she had expected.“We were able to get a really nice place at a lower price,” she said. “And we were able to stay below jumbo numbers with the loan we got.”According to the National Association of Home Builders, an index that measures the cost of many materials used in home construction was down about 4.5 percent in September from a year earlier for single-family homes and some 6.1 percent for multifamily homes.Stephen Melman, the director of economic services at the association, said that at the beginning of the year, contractors’ phones simply were not ringing. “That has picked up dramatically,” he said, “but it’s still not where it was.”Financing, it turns out, can be the trickiest part of buying a fixer-upper these days.“Banks are much tougher on the condition of an apartment,” said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. “The banks want to see that the apartments are complete and habitable. And it’s impossible to finance renovation. You have to have the cash.”Though they can be tricky to orchestrate, deals on fixer-uppers are still being done.“It hasn’t completely stopped,” Ms. Cohn said, “it’s just much more difficult than it’s ever been. Then again, everything about the world of financing is more difficult than it’s ever been.”In some cases, bank financing is simply not an option for apartments that are badly in need of renovation.Lee-Ann Pinder, a real estate agent with Citi Habitats, has a listing in the Hamilton Heights section of Harlem that will require intense rehabbing and an all-cash deal.The apartment, a 750-square-foot two-bedroom with one bathroom, has good light and a great deal of flexibility since most of the interior walls can come down, because they are not load-bearing. The building, a co-op on 152nd Street and Convent Avenue, is income restricted at $64,500 for an individual and $73,725 for a couple —which, combined with the all-cash requirement, creates a difficult formula.To put the apartment within somebody’s reach, the co-op, which owns the apartment, is asking $150,000. According to Streeteasy.com, there is only one apartment available in Hamilton Heights for less: a one-bedroom listed at $125,000 a few blocks away.But Ms. Pinder’s listing needs more than a little sprucing up.The kitchen looks as if someone decided to get the necessary gutting started (where’s the stove?), and some of the walls in the apartment appear to have been on the business end of an ax — an impression advanced by the presence of a small red fire hatchet on the kitchen counter on a recent Wednesday morning.“It is a glorious mess,” Ms. Pinder said. “It needs to be gutted. But then you can do what you want with the space.”In some apartments, however, the configuration of space is exactly the problem.There is, for example, a 2,600-square-foot duplex available for sale in the Osborne, a grand building on 57th Street and Seventh Avenue that went up in the 1880s. And it needs work.The apartment was cobbled together out of three smaller units — a studio on the fifth floor and two one-bedrooms, one on the fifth floor and one on the sixth. It has three bathrooms, two small kitchens, the space for three bedrooms, and a deeply confusing layout.The listing agent, Deborah Gimelson of Brown Harris Stevens, says that the seller bought it in its current configuration as a pied-à-terre. She does not know who the mastermind was behind the layout.“I wish I knew,” she said, “because I’d really like to have a discussion with him.”The apartment is listed at $1.675 million, down almost $1 million from the original price of $2.6 million last year.That’s still a lot of money for a three-bedroom apartment, but the building tends to command a premium — the ceilings are almost 14 feet high in some rooms and there are large, elaborate fireplaces in the shared foyers outside the apartment entrances.According to Streeteasy.com, active listings in the building range from $435,000, for a 600-square-foot one-bedroom, to $4.49 million for a 3,200-square-foot four-bedroom.“People who come here really want this building,” Ms. Gimelson said. “But you have to like a project — this will be a project.”When an apartment badly in need of renovation is for sale, the broker has to be up to the job as well.“It’s a laborious task to sell unrenovated apartments,” said Jill Jordan, a broker with Halstead Property. “People will want to bring their architects and their mothers — and then they want to bring everybody back! It’s a long process.”Ms. Jordan has a listing at 27 West 55th Street for a two-bedroom apartment with one bathroom, on the eighth floor of a co-op building.At $600,000, the apartment is reasonably priced, though not a steal. A renovated one-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath unit is listed for sale in the same building for $649,000.Carpeting needs to be torn up and the wood floors fixed or replaced. The walls and the ceiling need work, and the kitchen and bathroom need to be gutted.But, she says, if done right, that work would be rewarded.“The benefit is they get to live in a nicer apartment than they can afford,” she said. “They’re living in a better apartment than they paid for.”'"
"'09-11-01,'0','While I enjoyed Maureen Dowd’s sendup of “The Lost Symbol,” by Dan Brown (Oct. 11), I think she is off base in characterizing the Masons as “the ultimate elite private boys’ club.” My father, a poor immigrant Jew, was a Mason — to help him be one of the boys at work, he said. And although there are plenty of elaborate and imposing Scottish Rite temples, around here (Charleston, S.C.) there are far more plain, whitewashed cinder-block buildings whose members, in the local custom, are probably black. I see far more Masonic symbols on old Buicks than on new Mercedeses. My impression is that Masonry has served a useful function as a social club for working-class folk, whatever other adherents it may have among the elite of our nation’s capital.Thank you to Maureen Dowd for her honest review of “The Lost Symbol.” The only thing lost in this book was a reason to read it. I too waited patiently for its release because I so enjoyed “The Da Vinci Code” and “Angels and Demons.” I can’t describe the thrill I felt when I viewed “The Last Supper” in Milan just after completing the chapter describing its meaning. I bought “The Lost Symbol” on the very first day of its release and hurried home to begin what I thought would be an incredible, informative reading experience. What disappointment! Not only did I learn nothing about the Masons, but I could have put it down after the first 100 pages and not cared who lived or died or what “secrets” it revealed. I found it to be an insult to my intelligence and to all of Dan Brown’s loyal readers who had certainly expected more of him. When an author so mis­judges his audience, it’s time for him to find another profession.'"
"'09-11-01,'0','While it is common for cast memberson an animated film never tomeet — parts are often recordedindividually — Mr. Andersonwanted his actors not onlyto interact but also to do so in anenvironment that suited theirsemi-feral characters. Much ofthe film was recorded outdoors, ata friend’s farm in Connecticut, farfrom the sterility of a studio.“Wes didn’t mind overlapping ormistakes or any type of respiratoryissues,” said Jason Schwartzman,a longtime collaborator ofMr. Anderson’s who does thevoice of the junior fox, Ash. Infact, Mr. Anderson said, he wantednatural sounds in the mix —the wind, a burbling stream —and he hoped the radio-play atmospherewould compel the actorsto really dive into theirscenes. It worked, according toMr. Schwartzman. “We were alldigging in the dirt,” he said, “rollingaround in the bushes and actinglike animals.”For Mr. Anderson, the idea of a “Fantastic Mr.Fox” movie has always been inseparable fromstop motion, the painstaking method that requiresminiature figures to be moved in incrementsand photographed one frame at a time.“I like the way fur looks and moves in stop motion,”he said. One of his influences was “LeRoman de Renard” (“The Story of the Fox”), a1930s stop-motion film by the pioneering Russiananimator Ladislaw Starewicz based onthe trickster fox of medieval European folklore.Besides showcasing the bristling texturesof real animal hair, that movie also suggestedto Mr. Anderson the potential for playing withscale in the stop-motion process, using setsand puppets of varying sizes. The main characterson “Mr. Fox” were produced in at leastthree sizes, ranging from about an inch (forwide shots, usually in the more involved actionsequences) to more than a foot tall (for closeups).The puppets of the human characters are half-scale(about five inches tall) and were used in thefilm’s farmers-versus-animals showdown.While writing the screenplay, Mr. Andersonand Mr. Baumbach stayed atGipsy House, the Dahl estate near Oxford,an act of homage that was also afruitful research expedition. Dahl’s writingshed became the model for Mr. Fox’sstudy. The surrounding countryside inspiredthe film’s lay of the land. Theyalso discovered, in the author’s originalmanuscript, an ending, complete withsketches, that takes place at a supermarket.Dahl discarded it, but it worked wellfor the movie.“That was awfully lucky,because we needed a new ending,” Mr.Anderson said. (He and Mr. Baumbachhad moved up the book’s conclusion tothe middle of the film.) To create theaisles of produce, Mr. Lowry used realfruits and vegetables, augmented withclay, to make molds, and unconventionalmaterials — like clay, paper, and fabrics,dipped into a glue solution — to give thefoodstuff “a unique textural feel againstall that antiseptic white of the supermarketworld.”Ash’s bedroom is filled with personalizing touches: theshape and patterns of the bunk bed are taken from aGypsy caravan parked in the garden of the Dahl estate.But there may be no aspect of the film more personalthan the subplot involving the alienated teenager Ashand his visiting cousin, the faultless, athletic Kristofferson(voiced by Mr. Anderson’s younger brother, Eric)— a story line that Mr. Anderson expanded as theshoot progressed. Eric Anderson, an illustrator andchildren’s book author who has worked on the designsof his brother’s movies, said: “It’s a small, gentle kid relationship,and that seems out of the ordinary thesedays. It was very moving to sense how Ash and Kristoffersonwere dramatizing archetypal boy-brother-typerelationships.”Is he by any chance thinking of the relationshipsamong the Anderson brothers? “It mighthave a bit more Mel and Wes,” he said, referring totheir older brother, “than Wes and Eric.” Told of hisyounger brother’s theory, Wes Anderson laughed. “Ithink he’s right,” he said. “It never occurred to me, andhe’s never said that to me, but of course, that’s exactlywhat it is.”More than 30 sets were built,ranging from a chicken coop tofoxhole interiors to an office belongingto the lawyer Badger(voiced by Bill Murray). “It’s a law office,” Mr. Andersonsaid, “but Badger’s lawpartner is a beaver, so it’s in a beaverdam.” The surfaces were inspiredby walls made of woventwigs that Mr. Anderson cameacross at an art gallery in Paris (heand Mr. Lowry, the production designer,were constantly comparingvisual references by e-mail). Thisbeing an Anderson film, the setsare filled to overflowing with telltaleprops, each handmade to hisexact specifications.“Anything wewant to put in the shot, somebody’sgot to make it,” he said.Mr. Lowry noted, “You could go toa dollhouse place and buy a prop,but obviously it wouldn’t havequite the flair or the style.” In theold-school spirit of predigital animation,many of the sets use inventivelyrepurposed householdmaterials: terry cloth for grass,cotton balls for smoke, Saranwrap for a waterfall, the contentsof tea bags for tree leaves.'"
"'09-11-01,'0','“Try always,” says the worldly Cardinal Wolsey in “Wolf Hall,” ­ Hilary Mantel ’s fictional portrait of Henry VIII’s turbulent court, “to find out what people wear under their clothes.” Katherine of Aragon, the queen who can’t produce an heir, wears a nun’s habit. Anne Boleyn, the tease eager to supplant her, won’t let the king know what she’s wearing until their wedding night; she says “yes, yes, yes” to him, “then she says no.” Thomas More, willing to go to any lengths to prevent the marriage, wears a shirt of bristling horsehair, which mortifies his flesh until the sores weep. As for Thomas Cromwell, the fixer who does the king’s dirty work just as he once did the cardinal’s, what is he hiding under his lawyer’s sober winter robes? Something “impermeable,” Hans Holbein suspects as he paints Cromwell’s forbidding portrait. Armor, maybe, or stone.Go to the Frick Collection in New York and compare Holbein’s great portraits of Cromwell and More. More has all the charm, with his sensitive hands and his “good eyes’ stern, facetious twinkle,” in Robert Lowell’s description. By contrast, Cromwell, with his egg-shaped form hemmed in by a table and his shifty fish eyes turned warily to the side, looks official and merciless, his clenched fist, as Mantel writes, “sure as that of a slaughterman’s when he picks up the killing knife.” One of the many achievements of Mantel’s dazzling novel, winner of this year’s Man Booker Prize, is that she has reversed the appeal of these towering rivals of the Tudor period, that fecund breeding ground of British historical fiction as the American Civil War is of ours.Cromwell is the picaresque hero of the novel — tolerant, passionate, intellectually inquisitive, humane. We follow his winding quest in vivid present-tense flashbacks, drawn up from his own prodigious memory: how he left home before he was 15, escaping the boot of his abusive father, a brewer and blacksmith who beat him as if he were “a sheet of metal”; how he dreamed of becoming a soldier and went to France because “France is where they have wars.” Cromwell learns banking in Florence, trading in Antwerp. He marries, has children and watches helplessly as the plague decimates his family.In short, Cromwell learns everything everywhere, at a time when European knowledge about heaven and earth, via Copernicus and Machiavelli, is exploding. At 40, he “can draft a contract, train a falcon, draw a map, stop a street fight, furnish a house and fix a jury.” He knows the entire New Testament by heart, having mastered the Italian “art of memory” (part of the inner world of Renaissance magic that Mantel drew on in her comic novel “Fludd”), in which long lines of speech are fixed in the mind with vivid images.Cromwell is also, as Mantel sees him, a closet Protestant, monitoring Luther’s battles with Rome and exchanging secret letters with Tyndale, the English translator of the Bible, about the “brutal truth” of the Scriptures. “Why does the pope have to be in Rome?” Cromwell wonders. “Where is it written?” Historians have long suspected that Cromwell harbored Protestant sympathies, even before Anne Boleyn’s “resistant, quick-breathing and virginal bosom” caught the king’s eye. Mantel, with the novelist’s license, draws the circle more tightly. As a child, Cromwell is present when an old woman is burned at the stake for heresy: “Even after there was nothing left to scream, the fire was stoked.” Years later, he watches in disgust as Thomas More rounds up more heretics to feed to the fire. For Mantel, who acknowledges her debt to revisionist scholars, Henry’s divorce is the impetus for Cromwell’s “Tudor Revolution,” as the historian Geoffrey Elton called it, by which the British state won independence from foreign and ecclesiastic rule.In “Wolf Hall” it is More, the great imaginer of utopia, who is the ruthless tormenter of English Protestants, using the rack and the ax to set the “quaking world” aright. “Utopia,” Cromwell learns early on, “is not a place one can live.” More’s refusal to recognize Henry’s marriage was the basis for his canonization in 1935, as well as his portrayal as a hero of conscience in Robert Bolt’s play “A Man for All Seasons” and its 1966 screen version. To Mantel’s Cromwell, More is in love with his own martyrdom, his own theatrical self-importance, while Cromwell, more in keeping with the spirit of Bolt’s title, seeks a way out for his old rival.There’s a tense moment when More, locked in the Tower of London awaiting trial for treason, claims to have harmed no one. Cromwell explodes. What about Bainham, a mild man whose only sin was that he was a Protestant? “You forfeited his goods, committed his poor wife to prison, saw him racked with your own eyes, you locked him in Bishop Stokesley’s cellar, you had him back at your own house two days chained upright to a post, you sent him again to Stokesley, saw him beaten and abused for a week, and still your spite was not exhausted: you sent him back to the Tower and had him racked again.” Tortured, Bainham names names, who happen to be friends of Cromwell’s. “That’s how the year goes out, in a puff of smoke, a pall of human ash.”In her long novel of the French Revolution, “A Place of Greater Safety,” Mantel also wrote about the damage done by utopian fixers. And surely the current uproar over state-sponsored torture had its effect on both the writing and the imagining of “Wolf Hall.” Yet, although Mantel adopts none of the archaic fustian of so many historical novels — the capital letters, the antique turns of phrase — her book feels firmly fixed in the 16th century. Toward the end of the novel, Cromwell, long widowed and as usual overworked, “the man in charge of everything,” falls in love with Jane Seymour, lady-in-waiting to Boleyn, and considers spending a few days at the gothic-sounding Seymour estate called Wolf Hall. What could go wrong with such an innocent plan? Perhaps in a sequel Mantel will tell us.Thomas Cromwell remains a controversial and mysterious figure. Mantel has filled in the blanks plausibly, brilliantly. “Wolf Hall” has epic scale but lyric texture. Its 500-plus pages turn quickly, winged and falconlike. Trained in the law, Mantel can see the understated heroism in the skilled administrator’s day-to-day decisions in service of a well-ordered civil society — not of a medieval fief based on war and not, heaven help us, a utopia. “When you are writing laws you are testing words to find their utmost power,” Cromwell reflects. “Like spells, they have to make things happen in the real world, and like spells, they only work if people believe in them.” Hilary Mantel’s “Wolf Hall” is both spellbinding and believable.'"
"'09-11-01,'0','I first encountered a Weisgall opera in the spring of 1960, “Six Characters in Search of an Author,” based on the famous Pirandello play. The City Opera had given the premiere a year earlier. The power of the opera, the performance and the production knocked me flat. The play’s tense conflict arises when the blasé members of a professional theater troupe (changed here to an opera company) actually confront the six emotionally scarred characters of the dysfunctional family they are impersonating.Weisgall’s score, an astonishingly original manipulation of traditional opera techniques, seizes on this explosive situation in a carefully structured linear music-theater piece that takes full advantage of a composer’s right to interpret and reimagine the drama through purely musical means. The City Opera was putting on a festival of new American opera during that 1959-60 season, but compared with the theatrically sophisticated “Six Characters,” the pleasantly tuneful offerings of Douglas Moore, Gian Carlo Menotti, Carlisle Floyd, Robert Ward and Norman Dello Joio seemed cozy and flat.A budding opera composer myself at the time, I immediately presented myself to Weisgall in hopes of individual instruction, but his busy schedule did not allow private pupils. We did, however, become friends, and I was flattered when he solicited my opinions. I seldom saw his prickly side, which could be sharp indeed, but mostly benefited from his astute musical insights, immense culture and generosity. No composer of his generation wrote music with more passion and sincerity, and he used the voice he felt to be right and true for him.Yet he was receptive to an amazing range of musical idioms and could recognize genius when he heard it. One contemporary opera that always moved him deeply was Virgil Thomson’s “Mother of Us All,” with its crazy-quilt score of Protestant hymns, country marches and Americana ballads.“I can think of nothing farther removed from my own style, musical identity and ethnic background,” Weisgall once said to me. “But the piece is a miracle of sorts. The marbleized apotheosis of Susan B. Anthony at the end always leaves me in tears.”He was also greatly impressed by the ease and naturalness of Thomson’s ability to set the English language to music, the more so since Weisgall himself was a master of the craft. After his success with the conversational intricacies of “Six Characters,” Weisgall turned to a more epic style in “Athaliah” (1964), a grandly scaled choral opera based on Racine’s play. His most ambitious stage work was produced by the City Opera in 1968: “Nine Rivers From Jordan,” another complex blend of reality and fantasy, but this time a huge panorama that deals unflinchingly the moral dilemmas of World War II.That is perhaps the Weisgall opera most urgently in need of revival and reassessment, but my personal favorite is its successor, “Jenny, or the Hundred Nights” (1976), after Mishima. Its orchestral score is exquisitely diaphanous, and its arching vocal lines subtly reflect the stylized shapes of the librettist John Hollander’s poetic language.After getting to know Weisgall, I gradually began to suspect that his gentle refusal to take me on as a pupil, after perusing a few of my student scores, stemmed from politeness toward a young composer with no talent rather than a lack of time on his part. And the more of his music I got to know, not to mention his unsparing critiques of composer colleagues, the more that suspicion grew. While at work on “Esther,” Weisgall dropped a few hints that this probably would be his last opera. He put everything into it: not just the compositional skill and canny dramatic instincts that came from a lifetime of writing music for the theater but also his deep love and knowledge of the Jewish liturgical traditions that were so firmly rooted in the fabric of his style.As I recall it, the City Opera production of “Esther” modestly but effectively caters to the opera’s cinematic organization. The action flows back and forth in time and space against a series of projected films on sliding flats that reflect both the subject’s archaeological grandeur and private drama. This heartwarming story gave Weisgall precisely what he needed to sum up his achievement, employing a fastidious, finely worked out operatic technique that could combine the intimate detail of “Six Characters” with the grand epic scale of “Nine Rivers From Jordan.”All the traditional elements you look for in a major operatic experience are present: large choral scenes, tender love exchanges, hot moments of jealousy and political intrigue, subtle suggestions of local coloring, even a brief ballet. The whole score represents Weisgall at the peak of his powers. His orchestra never sounded more sumptuous, and his vocal writing was never more fluent and expressive. Best of all, each character is a fully drawn personality, particularly Esther herself, whose development from a lively teenager to a loving, courageous woman places her in the grand line of operatic heroines from Dido to Aida. Fortunately, the soprano Lauren Flanigan returns to repeat her radiant portrayal of the role and to remind us of the City Opera’s long tradition of creating its own opera stars.By bringing back “Esther” on such an important occasion, the City Opera may yet confound its critics. More important, the revival allows the company to reaffirm its mission and offers a second opportunity to savor the last work of a great American opera composer.'"

"'09-11-01,'0','Adapted from ""Ad Hoc at Home,"" by Thomas Keller.2. Wash the beets, cut off the stems and trim away any roots. Place each type of beet on a separate sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with the oil. Fold up the edges and crimp each to create a packet. Put the packets on a baking sheet. Cook until tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes for smaller beets and 60 to 75 minutes for larger beets. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.3. Once the beets are cool enough to handle, cut off the tops and use a paper towel to lightly rub the beet from the cut end toward the root to remove the skin. Cut the beets into 1/2-inch dice and set aside.4. Combine the apples, apple juice and vinegar in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the apples are crisp-tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the beets and mustards.5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the apples and beets to a 1 1/2-quart canning jar or other storage container, interspersing the mint leaves as you spoon in the fruit. Press down slightly on the compote and top with enough liquid to cover. Cover with the lid and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 1 week (it may discolor if stored any longer). Serve sprinkled with Maldon salt.NOTE: If you cannot find Chiogga and golden beets, use 1 pound of red beets, as close in size as possible.'"

"'09-11-02,'1','Sotheby’s of London has sold a collection of racy letters written by Lord Byron, below, for $455,466, more than $150,000 above the estimate and a record price for letters by a British Romantic poet. According to BBC News, an anonymous bidder bought the 71 pages of letters and fragments, dating from 1808, which include details of an affair with a servant girl and a disparaging reference to William Wordsworth. The documents came from the library of Archibald Primrose, prime minister from 1894 to 1895. Gabriel Heaton, a Sotheby’s specialist in British literature and history, told the BBC that the letters, to Byron’s close friend the Rev. Francis Hodgson, “offered a wonderful opportunity to reveal aspects of Lord Byron’s character that were either unknown or long forgotten.”'"
"'09-11-02,'1','As for revivals of acclaimed American works like “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” they are hardly out of fashion with Broadway audiences. “South Pacific,” “Hair” and “West Side Story” are doing well, though musicals are stronger sellers than plays.“There will always be an audience for a well-done revival of a great musical, but reviving a period-piece play now takes a special alchemy,” said André Bishop, artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, home to “South Pacific.” “A play revival needs to have a strong vision and to give people a reason why they should see it. What’s strange is that everyone I know thought this ‘Brighton Beach’ was wonderful.”Ben Brantley, the Times theater critic, praised the spontaneity of director David Cromer’s production and “Mr. Simon’s snappy, streamlined dialogue.”Mr. Simon was a forefather of situation comedy writers, and his scripts for stage and screen were embraced by actors like Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. But sitcoms have given way to reality shows like “American Idol,” one-liners to the sardonic humor of “The Office,” and the heavily plotted comedy of Mr. Simon’s film “California Suite” to the animated wit of “Up” and the fratty banter of “The Hangover,” two of the summer’s biggest hits.“American sensibilities about comedy change so rapidly, especially in the cultural centers on the East Coast and West Coast where people are always looking for the next new style of humor, whereas Neil Simon’s brand of humor is pretty unchanging,” said Susan Koprince, author of “Understanding Neil Simon” and a professor of English at the University of North Dakota.Mr. Simon’s signature has always been the well-written, straightforward punch line, but new and revived comedies have done best on Broadway lately when they have been dark, satiric and outrageously narcissistic. The recent revivals of the plays “Boeing-Boeing,” “Speed-the-Plow” and “The Norman Conquests” took flight because of fast-paced timing but also had frissons of fear and panic just beneath the surface humor. A mix of comedy and pain also proved potent for the original play “August: Osage County,” while two other new plays, “The Lieutenant of Inishmore” and “The Little Dog Laughed,” were sharp satires of political terrorism and Hollywood.While reality shows like “American Idol” and forensic dramas like “NCIS” dominate television today, popular comedies like the traditionally plotted sitcom “Two and a Half Men” and the character-driven “Desperate Housewives” also share sharply written dialogue and recognizable modern characters like those found in “God of Carnage.”“It’s clear from the ascendancy of certain types of comedy, like the trend exemplified by Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, Steve Carell, ‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin,’ ‘Knocked Up,’ that what audiences are seeking in humor is getting more raw and edgy than Simon’s work,” said Matthew Maguire, a playwright who is director of the theater program at Fordham University.To that end, if ticket sales before the critics’ reviews were any measure, Mr. Simon struck many people as passé. Most tickets to “Brighton Beach Memoirs” were sold at discounts like the TKTS booths. (Producers release bulks of tickets at a discount when they fail to sell at full price.) The average ticket price for “Brighton Beach” was only $21.32 for the most recent week with available data. (The average ticket price for “Hamlet” was $104.01 for the comparable week.)Popular culture has also developed a bigger-is-better, entertainment-as-event attitude that runs counter to the ethos of the typical Simon play. Stadium-arena rock concerts, the “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” book and film series, the days-long cable news coverage of Michael Jackson’s death, the ever-increasing punch of season finales on television dramas — these do not have equivalents in the Simon canon and are not staples of Broadway.The producers of “Brighton Beach” hoped it too would become an event once the play was running in repertory with its companion by Mr. Simon, “Broadway Bound,” about the same family a decade later. Two earlier plays in the past few years succeeded in part because they pursued that strategy.The biggest commercial theatrical “event” on Broadway recently was last season’s revival of “The Norman Conquests,” a trilogy of British comedies with interlocking plots and characters; all three opened at the same time, delighting critics, though it was not ultimately profitable. The “Brighton Beach” producers decided to open “Broadway Bound” a month later, Mr. Cromer said, in order to give “Brighton Beach” a chance to build an audience and to spread out the financial obligations.“Brighton Beach” may have suffered by forgoing another traditional strategy of popular entertainment: It had no big stars. The two plays, based loosely on Mr. Simon’s family, were to have largely the same cast, led by the stage and television veteran Laurie Metcalf. The producers and director said it was necessary to cast strong actors for parts that require dramatic and comic range and that can edge into ethnic stereotype.“If you want a star, your options are often narrowed in finding a perfect person for the part,” Mr. Cromer said in an interview.Mr. Simon also found himself up against a bevy of Broadway plays and an economy in which theatergoers are being choosy about $100-a-seat shows. Some commenters on The Times ArtsBeat blog (artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com) said this weekend that Mr. Simon simply was not the can’t-miss ticket he once was.“Too soon for Neil Simon plays to be classified as classics and too late for them to be seen as relevant,” wrote Spence Halperin, a social worker in New York City. “Try again in 15 years.”'"
"'09-11-02,'1','Ms. Desai said that the surcharge — which in effect would raise the base fare to $3 — should be temporary and that Albany should seek other alternatives to finance the transportation authority. “It will have an impact on ridership in these economic times,” she said.Drivers in the region are also contributing to the authority’s rescue. Since September, renewing a driving registration for two years carries an additional $50 surcharge; a standard eight-year driver’s license renewal will cost an additional $16. And a 5 percent tax on car rentals went into effect on June 1.But the payroll tax has prompted the most animosity so far, most of it coming from suburban business leaders in the 12-county region who argued that their tax burden greatly outweighed the benefits they receive from the transportation authority.The tax also has drawn strong objections from private and religious schools whose officials say they are being forced to cut services and possibly raise tuition while public schools in the area get a pass.Under terms hammered out in May by state lawmakers, public school districts will be reimbursed for the tax, which costs businesses 34 cents for every $100 of wages. The unusual provision was intended by the bill’s backers to win over reluctant legislators, but other nonprofit groups were not exempted.“It’s really an issue, I think, of basic fairness,” said James Cultrara, education director for the New York State Catholic Conference, an advocacy group that represents the state’s Catholic schools. “Certainly we can understand why the Legislature would want to reimburse the public schools. Why not then also reimburse the Catholic and other private schools?”Legislation is now pending in Albany to amend the tax so that independent schools can also be reimbursed. But it is unlikely that the bill will be considered until next year; in the meantime, private school officials say they will have to pay $6 million to the state.“It could be anywhere between $35,000 and $70,000 a school,” said Rabbi Shmuel Lefkowitz, a spokesman for Agudath Israel of America, a religious school group. “Donations and contributions are going down; parents are unemployed or underemployed and not able to pay the tuition. With this prior picture of everything else that has been happening, this hurts.”For the students at Children’s Storefront, a tuition-free elementary school in Harlem, the payroll tax could mean the end of afternoon basketball.“It instantly put me $8,000 over budget,” said Kathy Egmont, the head of school. “I was really surprised that there was not an exemption for even smaller nonprofits.”Ms. Egmont said she was circling back to donors to try to make up the shortfall. She said the reduced budget could force her to reconsider hiring teachers and maintaining certain summer school programs and the boys’ and girls’ basketball teams.“Our staff is working often at lower-than-market salaries because we’re a charity, so they get doubly hit,” she said. “Their subway fares are going up, and this impacts our ability to help raise their salaries.”Those fares may have gone up even higher, however, had the tax not been decided in May. Inaction in Albany may have resulted in steep fare increases on the buses, subways and commuter trains used by students and teachers alike.“The M.T.A. is part of the economic lifeblood of the region itself,” said Tom Bergen, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Taxation and Finance. “Businesses benefit substantially from having the M.T.A. serving as a transportation infrastructure.”Private school administrators believe that many parents are only now becoming aware of the payroll tax’s impact, in part thanks to a letter sent late last month by the Archdiocese of New York suggesting that “turning down the thermostat” could be one result of the new tax.“We have a budget that was already set,” said John R. Joven, the principal of Holy Name School, which serves students in preschool through eighth grade on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “It’s the first time anybody heard about it.”'"
"'09-11-02,'1','It may be an off year for elections, but there are still a lot of races on Tuesday. The big contests are the governors’ elections in New Jersey and Virginia, but there will be voting for mayors in several big cities, some states have referendums or ballot initiatives and there are a couple of vacant Congressional seats to be filled.In New Jersey, the race between Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Christopher J. Christie, his Republican challenger, appears to be very tight, according to the latest polls. When an independent candidate, Christopher J. Daggett, is included, he receives 8 percent to 20 percent of the support of likely voters. All differences between Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie fall within each poll’s margin of sampling error of plus or minus three or four percentage points on each candidate.The Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, Robert F. McDonnell, is leading his Democratic opponent, R. Creigh Deeds, according to recent polls of likely voters. Mr. McDonnell’s advantages range from 18 points in the Virginia Commonwealth University poll, to 11 points in the Washington Post poll.Polls could make several mayors optimistic about their bids for re-election. In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leads William C. Thompson Jr., his Democratic challenger, by a wide margin in his attempt at a third term. In the most recent Marist College poll,Mr. Bloomberg is backed by 53 percent when those who lean toward a particular candidate are included; Mr. Thompson is supported by 38 percent. The poll was conducted from Oct. 26 to Oct. 28 among 524 likely voters.The Quinnipiac University poll surveyed 1,088 likely voters from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26 and got similar results. Fifty-three percent preferred Mr. Bloomberg, while Mr. Thompson got 35 percent.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','Kelly made an inauspicious debut in that sloppy loss, but his reintroduction to the country came as he choked up in a news conference the next day. Kelly announced that Blount, perhaps Oregon’s best player, was suspended for the season. (Blount may be reinstated this week.) Despite the unrest, Kelly said he never doubted himself or the team.“We lost, 19-8,” he said in a phone interview Sunday night. “We didn’t lose, 90-0.”Watching this all unfold nearly 3,000 miles away, the Boston College receivers coach Ryan Day was not worried about Kelly, who had recruited Day and later coached with him at the University of New Hampshire.Day had seen Kelly lose plenty of times before, in the early days trying to turn New Hampshire into a national power in the Football Championship Subdivision, then known as Division I-AA.“When you get your butt kicked, that’s when you really see what people are made of,” Day said. “And with Chip, on Monday morning, he was always the same guy.”Kelly and the entire Oregon program certainly took their punches in the news media in the days that followed. The Blount punch was replayed nearly as much as Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl halftime wardrobe malfunction.Kelly said the positive from the loss and the incident was the outpouring from coaches around the country. Miami Coach Randy Shannon called to give advice about how the university handled its brawl with Florida International. The former Notre Dame coach Bob Davie checked in, as did Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden. Even P. J. Carlesimo, who knew Kelly from coaching basketball at New Hampshire College, talked to Kelly.“The neat thing, to be honest with you, was how many people reached out to say hang in there,” Kelly said.From there, Kelly showed the traits he picked up on his unconventional path to coaching stardom — accountability and creativity. He did all the right things away from the spotlight, even making the ultimate gesture of accountability by writing a personal check to a fan who wrote a letter demanding a refund for his trip to Boise.Kelly’s on-field creativity comes from knowing every nuance of the football field; he has been a defensive coordinator, offensive coordinator, running backs coach, special-teams coach, secondary coach and offensive line coach throughout his career as an assistant.At New Hampshire in various roles from 1994 to 2006, Kelly had lots of opportunities to leave. He resisted and stayed loyal until Oregon finally called with the offensive coordinator job.“He did it the right way,” Day said. “He came up in a system, and when his opportunity came at Oregon, he was ready. A lot of people aren’t ready. He was ready. He had the answers and the answers to the answers.”And for this Oregon team, perhaps the best answer came from one of his motivational ploys in the aftermath of the Boise State game. Kelly joked that, not surprisingly, he got a flood of e-mail messages. A few of the e-mailers brought up the children’s book “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.”He addressed the team with the story of a boy who told his mother he wanted to move to Australia after having a day much like the night the Ducks had in Boise.“People in Australia have bad days, too,” Kelly told his team, mimicking the advice of Alexander’s mother.A copy of the book now sits on a table in Kelly’s office, though there have not been many reasons to read it lately. Oregon edged Purdue and Utah in the games after the loss, and things clicked from there. Oregon blew out California, 42-3, on Sept. 26 and things have gone so smoothly that Oregon rang up 613 yards on U.S.C., the most the Trojans had yielded since 1946.Quarterback Jeremiah Masoli is playing like an all-American, the red-shirt freshman tailback LaMichael James has emerged as the prototype for Kelly’s offense, and a no-name defense is playing as a cohesive unit.When asked if he would dwell on the performance against U.S.C., Kelly was quick to respond.“Not really, to be honest with you,” he said.In his short time as head coach, Kelly has learned not to overreact. And while he most likely won’t be wearing the mascot head anytime soon — too smelly, he said — Kelly has already revealed himself as one of the country’s top coaches.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','By filing a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy plan, CIT is aiming to limit the damage inflicted on the scores of retailers and other companies that depend on the specialized financing it provides. It is the dominant provider of factoring, in which a company sells the debt it is owed to a company like CIT at a discount.Many companies that provide factoring have been hit hard by the faltering economy and have closed their doors, leaving more businesses dependent on the likes of CIT, according to Michael C. Appel, the head of the retail and consumer practice at Quest Turnaround Advisors, a consulting firm.“In the long run it will be good for CIT,” said Emanuel Weintraub, chief executive of Emanuel Weintraub and Associates, a management consultancy. “In the short term it will not be good for thinly financed companies that may not be immediately taken in by other lenders.”When CIT disclosed its troubles in July, many retailers were preparing their orders for the holiday season and were terrified by the prospects of a sudden and uncontrolled Chapter 11 filing, said Ellen Davis, vice president of the National Retail Federation.CIT’s filing will test whether a financial company can survive the Chapter 11 process. Bankruptcy has long been considered a death knell for lenders, whose very existence depends on the confidence of its creditors and customers. The company’s struggles have been watched with interest and trepidation by analysts and its clients.“The decision to proceed with our plan of reorganization will allow CIT to continue to provide funding to our small business and middle market customers, two sectors that remain vitally important to the U.S. economy,” Jeffrey M. Peek, CIT’s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.It also means the end of CIT’s efforts to transcend its roots as a sleepy financier of retailers, restaurants and manufacturers. Under Mr. Peek, a former high-ranking Merrill Lynch executive, the company branched out into student lending and investment advisory services. Befitting its ambitions, it moved from an office park in Livingston, N.J., to a flashy tower in Midtown Manhattan.But the company was laid low by the turmoil in the credit markets, which sapped its ability to finance its daily operations. Even after receiving the initial $2.3 billion in government aid, it went to its regulators for additional help, only to be told it needed to find a solution in the private markets. It subsequently bargained with its creditors over a restructuring plan that would keep it operating and cut $10 billion in unsecured debt.While CIT had hoped to stay out of bankruptcy court through a bond exchange offer, that plan failed to win enough support from bondholders, the company said in a statement.With $71 billion in assets and nearly $65 billion in liabilities, CIT’s bankruptcy ranks among the largest in corporate history, though it is dwarfed by the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. CIT said in its bankruptcy petition that $800 million of its bonds would mature from Sunday through Tuesday.CIT said that only its holding company was filing for bankruptcy, and that most of its important operating subsidiaries, including its Utah bank, would continue to operate normally. As part of an effort to revamp its business model, the company plans to move more of its operations into its bank instead of relying on the more volatile capital markets.Bondholders will receive about 70 cents for each dollar owed them through the prepackaged bankruptcy. CIT said investors would have received as little as 6 cents on the dollar in the alternative, a free-fall bankruptcy that lacked a pre-approved reorganization plan.CIT said in a statement that holders of about 85 percent of its $30 billion in bond debt participated in the voting. Those investors voted almost unanimously to support the prepackaged bankruptcy plan.Last week, the company got a $4.5 billion loan from several investors. It also reached an accord with Goldman Sachs that would preserve a $2.13 billion loan.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','Even in a country with a lot of wilderness, it was a shocking death. Taylor Josephine Stephanie Luciow, a promising 19-year-old folk singer from Toronto who performed under the name Taylor Mitchell, was attacked by two coyotes as she set out for a hike in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, one of Eastern Canada’s leading tourist destinations. She died late Tuesday night in Halifax, where she had been airlifted for treatment.The reaction of Ms. Mitchell’s grief-stricken mother was perhaps more unusual: Emily Mitchell issued a statement to news organizations in which she asked authorities to spare any coyotes involved in the attack.“We take a calculated risk when spending time in nature’s fold — it’s the wildlife’s terrain,” she wrote. “When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes, I clearly heard Taylor’s voice say, ‘Please don’t, this is their space.’ She wouldn’t have wanted their demise, especially as a result of her own.”Even before the statement appeared, a Parks Canada conservation officer had already killed one coyote that was behaving aggressively. And a police officer who came to Ms. Mitchell’s aid thought he had shot and injured a second coyote.Attacks by coyotes, even minor ones, on people are very unusual. Chip Bird, the Cape Breton field superintendent for Parks Canada, said that over his 30-year career, he had never seen a serious attack until last week, although six years ago a coyote “nipped someone’s arm” in the park.The trail where the attack occurred was still closed on Sunday afternoon, and a team from Parks Canada was continuing to study the coyotes in the area, which number about five. Mr. Bird would not rule out further killings if there were other dangerously aggressive animals, but he added that Ms. Mitchell’s wish might be honored.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','Honduras was once the realm of American banana barons who overthrew governments to secure better tax treatment. More recently, it was a training and supply base for United States-backed contra rebels fighting a cold war proxy battle in Nicaragua.As the cold war ended, Honduras managed to put years of military rule behind it and became known for its relative political stability, drawing foreign investors in recent years to buy beachfront property, start manufacturing businesses and build hotels along the country’s Caribbean coast, a world-class spot for scuba diving. The expatriate community has expanded from a core of aid workers, missionaries and military veterans to include cigar-puffing retirees, Spanish language students, entrepreneurs and real estate investors.The American Embassy in the capital, Tegucigalpa, says there are 15,000 Americans registered as living in Honduras but as many as 30,000 counting long-term tourists, people with dual nationality and businesspeople living in the country.Mr. Zelaya’s removal and the international condemnation it has drawn have managed to isolate the country again. Foreign business owners in Honduras have tended to support Mr. Micheletti, who replaced Mr. Zelaya, even while acknowledging that sending Mr. Zelaya into exile may have been illegal. But they agree wholeheartedly that the country’s turmoil is hurting their wallets.Chris and Will Haughey, brothers from St. Louis, picked Honduras as the place to open a socially conscious certified wood toy factory because of its timber-rich jungles, tax-free manufacturing areas and tariff exemptions under the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a trade deal with the United States. Their idea was to market their magnetic wood block sets to business executives as desk toys and to parents as an eco-friendly alternative to Legos. Despite the country’s bureaucracy, they considered it a more politically stable place than neighboring Nicaragua or El Salvador.But they had not factored the ouster of a president into their business plans.Chris Haughey, a Stanford-educated engineer who fell for Honduras while volunteering at a shelter for street boys, spent a recent morning negotiating with a group of rock-wielding Zelaya supporters to let him through their roadblock on his way to work. As the brothers tried to meet orders before the holidays, they lost workdays as government curfews kept their employees holed up in their homes.“It’s just frustrating,” said Mr. Haughey, who abandoned his goal to open the plant in August as the political meltdown in June added new delays to Honduras’s already formidable red tape. He now says he will try to open next month.Daniel O’Connor, an investment consultant who moved to Honduras from Florida to manage one of the capital’s most lavish hotels in the 1990s, the Honduras Maya, said the political turmoil added insult to injury for investors already crunched by the economic slump.“It’s the perfect storm,” he said. A handful of luxury resorts on the islands off the Honduran coast have halted construction since Mr. Zelaya was removed, he said, blaming news media coverage of protest violence for making the country appear to be a war zone.“My friends back home are surprised we’re not hunkered down with six months of food supply and weapons,” he said, sipping a rum and Coke at the Intercontinental on a recent afternoon. A fierce critic of Mr. Zelaya, Mr. O’Connor had set up an information center at the hotel to provide journalists with information to justify the leader’s removal.Business owners are hopeful that the deal reached Thursday, which may return Mr. Zelaya to office before the end of his term in January and which still must be approved by the country’s Congress, will restore a sense of normalcy here.But any economic rebound has not happened yet. Ms. Cueva, the eco-resort owner, has been laying off workers and cutting back the hours of those who remain. To reduce costs, she is unplugging freezers and limiting travels to town for supplies.“I do believe this is bigger than all of us,” Ms. Cueva said, lighting a cigarette on a Guatemalan candle as the Copán ruins below faded into dusk. “This is a 21st-century socialist revolution.”'"
"'09-11-02,'1','Apart from the challenges of covering business in a digital age, the endemic categories of advertising including financial services, insurance and consulting services, and vaporized ad budgets from Detroit, have left once-fat chronicles of the business epoch bereft.But it isn’t just that Cadillacs aren’t selling like they used to. It’s also that the people who made them, bought them and drove them seem far more mortal and less interesting than they did just a few years ago.Business magazines used to relish explaining all the complex new financial instruments that Wall Street was using to pile up profits. But now it has become clear that the titans who were wielding those obscure tools had no idea what they were doing — even less an idea than the journalists in some cases.And the fact that they needed billions and billions in taxpayer money to bail them out has left the former Masters of the Universe with all the social cachet of welfare recipients. In fact, people on welfare seem more deserving now that some of the rescued have come roaring back just in time for year-end bonuses.Business journalism loves epic scale, but if you want to read a magazine about the biggest player in the financial industry or the auto industry, best pick up an issue of Governing or Congressional Quarterly.Much ink was spilled over the years about how business would take off if only government would get out of the way, but now all the salient conversation is on increased regulation and oversight. And bureaucrats in full frolic will never be an editorial match for guys who leave the office in helicopters to reach houses that should have their own ZIP code.It’s not that the public has lost its appetite for stories about handsome men in three-piece suits who clink whiskey glasses at the end of a long, not-so-hard day while talking smack about their female co-workers. But “Mad Men” pretty much sates that need. The businessman as Colossus is by now a nostalgic impulse.When we see a close-up of Crockett & Jones lace-ups, we realize that they often are inhabited by manifest feet of clay and find ourselves wondering whether the taxpayers paid for them.It is not just business that has changed, it is the idea of business. For decades, it was the best minds that American business schools produced, along with bootstrapping savants, crossing swords with the invisible hand and coming away winners.But if the consequences are removed from the equation and the feds are there to cushion any downside, riding the upside seems less magical. Writers and editors who cover business now know that the jig is up, that those bespoke suits are put on one leg at a time by men that seem far less Olympian than they once did. Even Warren Buffett, the oracle of both business and Omaha, has gotten pushed around by an economy full of trap doors, unforeseen consequences and head feints.There are exceptions. Google. Apple. Twitter (assuming it ever makes money). But the editorial tropes of financial might don’t easily describe the nature of their accomplishment. How hot and bothered is a reader supposed to get about an algorithm? And no one wants to read a magazine about the sovereign funds, foreign investors and bargain hunters from afar who seem to be the real power in buying in at the bottom.Business coverage has been, at its heart, aspirational, a brand promise that suggests that if you clip the right articles, internalize the right rhetoric, then you too will end up as one of the shiny, happy people striding boldly across the pages of magazines with names like Fortune, Money, Fast Company and Wired. But nobody is going to read, let alone aspire to, magazines called Middled, Outsourced, Left Behind and Clobbered. It’s as if American business has lost custody of its own story.The exuberance, irrational and otherwise, will most likely return at some point, just as it always has. But people could be forgiven for not believing in business, or business news, the way they used to.If a recovery is under way, most Average Joes are not buying in or benefiting so far. On Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending actually dropped in September, the first time it had gone down in five months, and the Dow buckled 2.5 percent at the end of trading last week. Consumers clearly lack confidence in the recovery, and, by extension, the people who are supposed to make it happen. And doubt doesn’t sell magazines.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','By the end of trading Friday, the combined market value of the newly listed companies was more than $20 billion, creating fortunes for the founders and investors in those companies.China is already the world’s biggest market for initial public offerings, and its resurgent economy is flush with capital and investors with a big appetite for risk.But trading experts have long complained that this country’s market system is seriously flawed, partly because of a misallocation of capital.State-run banks lend primarily to state-owned companies, which tend to be inefficient. Listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are dominated by government enterprises. Young private Chinese companies generally list their shares overseas, in Hong Kong or on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, because there are few opportunities for stock listings inside the country.But the government hopes to change that with the creation of the GEM, which is based in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen. The government is seeking to create a more efficient capital market system, one that would steer investment capital to small and midsize private enterprises — companies that can help reshape the economy through technology and innovation, rather than low-price exports.Although the GEM, which is also known here as ChiNext, is tiny when compared with the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, regulators hope it will eventually compete with Nasdaq and entice more Chinese companies to list with GEM.The GEM is also expected to give a boost to China’s venture capital and private equity markets, which have been hampered by a system that until now has not provided wealthy investors with what industry insiders call an exit strategy, or a way to eventually cash out of their investments in small companies through a domestic stock market.There are big hurdles to creating a stock exchange similar to Nasdaq, which includes companies like Microsoft, Intel and Google. For instance, volatile stock prices and high valuations could hurt the new bourse’s credibility with entrepreneurs and investors.Chinese investors are known to speculate, favoring momentum buying and selling rather than the underlying fundamentals of a company, analysts say. Indeed, the casinolike nature of the Shanghai and existing Shenzhen exchanges, combined with government intervention, have added to the volatility of the Chinese markets.Analysts warn that the GEM could also be prone to similar speculative frenzies.Andy Xie, an economist who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley, is already calling the GEM a “V.I.P. table on top of a big casino.”Chang Chun, an expert on financial markets at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said that China needed a market to serve start-ups, but “the issue is the maturity of Chinese investors.”Before trading opened Friday, he said, regulators created rules to guard against excessive volatility and even warned investors that they would crack down on aggressive speculation. Still, Friday’s opening — with 28 companies beginning to trade at once — was marked by wild price swings.One cause of concern was the huge valuations of the first batch of stocks listed Friday.The average GEM-listed company has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 100 — meaning investors are paying about $100 for every $1 of 2008 earnings. By comparison, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index of big American companies trades at closer to 20 times earnings.GEM stocks are also priced far above Shanghai stocks, which have long been considered inflated by United States standards.Still, hundreds of Chinese companies are eagerly awaiting their turn to list on the GEM, and many analysts say the exchange will fill an important need: directing financing toward smaller start-ups that help rebalance economic growth. Ms. Zhou at Vassar said she had heard that there were over 1,000 companies in Beijing’s high-tech district alone that met the requirements to list shares on the GEM exchange.Analysts say many more start-ups will be eager to list after seeing the riches made by the first group of companies to go public on the GEM.For instance, Wang Zhongjun and his brother Wang Zhonglei are the founders of Beijing-based Huayi Brothers Media, one of the country’s leading film producers. Shares in their company jumped 148 percent Friday, for a valuation of about $1.7 billion.'"
"'09-11-02,'1','As often happens, the work of an artist who has recently been the subject of a museum exhibition suddenly surfaces at auction. It is no coincidence that a Kandinsky is being offered on the heels of a career retrospective, seen at the Pompidou Center in Paris in the summer and now at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In this case the heirs of Arthur M. Sackler, the American art collector who died in 1987, decided it was the right time to part with a 1932 Kandinsky filled with his abstract geometric forms. It is expected to bring $6 million to $8 million at Sotheby’s on Wednesday.Perhaps the buzz around “Pop Life, Art in a Material World,” a show that opened last month at the Tate Modern in London, has something to do with the number of Warhols and other Pop artists up for sale. The undisputed star at Sotheby’s postwar sale on Nov. 11 — and what may well be the hottest work of the season — is Warhol’s “200 One Dollar Bills,” a 1962 painting from his seminal first series of silk-screens. A private European collector is selling the work, which was once part of the celebrated collection of Robert C. Scull, the taxi tycoon and Pop and Minimalist collector who died in 1986. That year the seller bought the painting from a Sotheby’s auction of Scull’s estate for $385,000, at the time a record price for Warhol at auction. Now it is expected to fetch $8 million to $12 million.Mr. Brant is also selling a Warhol. “Tunafish Disaster,” a 1963 painting from the “Death and Disaster Series,” is being offered at Christie’s on Nov. 10 with an estimate of $6 million to $8 million. In addition Mr. Brant is selling a 1983 six-panel painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, “Brother Sausage.” Christie’s experts believe it could bring $9 million to $12 million.Tuesday night’s sale of Impressionist and modern art at Christie’s is perhaps the weakest of the season. “It’s been a struggle,” said Conor Jordan, head of Christie’s Impressionist and modern art department in New York. Among the highlights are traditional Impressionist works like an 1896 Degas pastel of a dancer rubbing her feet, which comes from an unidentified Japanese collector and is expected to sell for $7 million to $9 million. An 1873 panoramic landscape by Pissarro is estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million. It is being sold by the London collector Lord Harris of Peckham, chairman of Carpetright, a floor covering company.There is dealer property too, like Mondrian’s “Composition II, With Red, 1926” that other dealers say is from the Nahmads, a family that runs galleries in London and New York. They bought the abstract canvas at Christie’s in London five years ago for $2.9 million and are now hoping to get $4.5 million to $6.5 million.Sotheby’s sale on Wednesday night is bigger and the material is stronger. One of the most important sellers that night is offering works described in the catalog as property from “an important European collection.” That collection, experts familiar with the lots say, is Mr. Reijtenbagh's and includes canvases by Bonnard and Modigliani, Degas and Corot. There is also a Kees van Dongen image of a half-nude Arab boy, inspired by a trip he took to North Africa in 1910. It is estimated at $7 million to $10 million, one of the most expensive works of the evening.Another big-ticket item at Sotheby’s is a Giacometti sculpture, “L’Homme Qui Chavire,” conceived in 1950 and cast a year later. It is being sold by S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate who owns Condé Nast, another business that has recently undergone layoffs. The $8 million to $12 million estimate may seem high, but the Giacometti has been unsuccessfully offered for sale privately by both Christie’s and the Gagosian Gallery for nearly twice that estimate. Experts say that the auction process will help sort out prices for Giacomettis.Christie’s has made some estimates in its postwar and contemporary art sale on Nov. 10 purposely low. It is selling several gems that once belonged to Cunningham and John Cage, his partner in life and work who died in 1992. They include “Dancers on a Plane,” a cross-hatch canvas by Jasper Johns that is estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million. Paintings by Mr. Johns have sold privately for as much as $80 million.Brett Gorvy, a head of Christie’s postwar and contemporary art department, explained his firm’s approach this season: “We have consciously stayed away from young artists who either have not yet been tested or whose prices have already got way too high.”'"
"'09-11-02,'1','LOS ANGELES — Military officials said on Sunday that they did not expect to find survivors among the seven Coast Guard members and two Marines missing since their aircraft collided in a ball of fire Thursday off the coast of San Diego.After searching 644 square miles of ocean, officials directing the search declared it a “recovery operation” and focused on investigating the cause of the crash and combing through about 50 miles of floating debris off the coast of San Clemente Island, a staging area for military training drills.“After an exhaustive effort with the intent to rescue, our hope has dimmed in finding any survivors,” said Petty Officer First Class Allyson Conroy, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in San Diego. “We are now concentrating on recovering anything out of the water, or anyone out of the water.”Additional personnel from the Coast Guard and Marines on Sunday began to piece together what caused the crash, Petty Officer Conroy said. Investigators began to interview “anybody who might have seen anything, or been involved in the flight itself,” she said. They were also analyzing pieces of the plane and helicopter dragged from the water.The crash involved a Coast Guard C-130 transport plane carrying seven crew members heading south from Sacramento and a Marine Corps AH-1W Super Cobra with a two-man crew.The names of all nine people — eight men and one woman — were released on Saturday, as their family members gathered to wait for news.'"

"'09-11-03,'0','THE Great Recession is over. The nation's gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent during the third quarter, proving that the longest, broadest and most severe American downturn since the 1930s has finally given way to recovery.It is no accident that the recession ended just as Washington’s fiscal stimulus program began providing its maximum impetus to the economy. If the financial crisis had been allowed to continue unchecked by aggressive government action, we would not yet have reached a turning point.Still, the recovery remains fragile. No doubt, there will be moments in the coming months when the economy appears liable to falter again. In order to ensure that today’s tentative recovery becomes a lasting expansion, the government must now make it a priority to deal with employment — particularly among small businesses.Small businesses are especially vital to job growth. Establishments with fewer than 20 employees account for 25 percent of all jobs, but these same-sized companies generated 40 percent of the job growth in the last economic expansion, from 2003 to 2007. In their recent efforts to recharge the economy, policy makers have all but forgotten small business, finding it both easier and more visible to help large multinational firms. Unfortunately, though, big business can’t provide the jobs needed to power the economy forward.Businesses may not be shedding jobs as aggressively as they were earlier this year, but they still aren’t hiring. Unless they start doing so soon, consumers won’t have the wherewithal to keep spending, and the economy could slip back into recession. A cycle of falling wages and prices would likely begin, adding to the danger and giving the Fed and Congress fewer options and resources to respond.It is conceivable that businesses will resume hiring soon. Employment growth historically lags a pickup in gross domestic product. But firms typically increase production by first increasing workers’ hours and adding temporary help. Neither has happened so far: working hours remain stuck at a record low of 33 hours a week, and the number of temporary jobs is still in decline (nearly a million have been lost in the past three years).Small firms are now struggling to obtain credit; their principal lenders, small banks, are under intense pressure, and hundreds more are set to be taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Credit card lenders, another key source of loans to small business, have aggressively raised their underwriting standards. Policy makers could offer quick relief by empowering the Small Business Administration to provide more credit.'"
"'09-11-03,'0','If Facebook, blogs and other inventions of the Internet age had existed in the 1950s, would someone have created an IHateVinScully.com Web site to grouse about his bias as a Dodgers announcer during the Yankees-Brooklyn World Series that he called? Or how about a site called ShutUpMelAllen.com to gripe about his supposed pinstriped preference when he was calling some of that same series?Fox’s Joe Buck and Tim McCarver are in their 12th World Series together — time enough to become Exhibits A and B in the culture of complaint, postseason edition. No announcer goes unscathed, not with myriad outlets existing to help fans vent their belief in the biases and mistakes of those who call the games.One can only imagine how Howard Cosell would react to being an object of derision by Tweeters.Comments on one of three anti-Buck and McCarver Facebook groups — and reader responses to a post I wrote on The Times’s Bats blog about their insistence that they have no bias — describe a loathing for the two announcers that focuses to some degree on the perception that they are largely anti-Yankee. These include:“You can obviously tell that Tim McCarver hates the Yankees!!!”“McCarver can deny it all he wants, but he has clearly been biased against the Yankees since he left their broadcast booth.”“McCarver has STATED on National TV — I heard him — ‘I hate the Yankees.’ ”McCarver and Buck have said that their only preference is for long and exciting series, and I believe that. Fans tend to listen with their hearts and have their heartfelt sentiments supported by their local announcers throughout the season. Then, the national announcers enter and cannot satisfy anyone: if you are excited about great plays by one team, fans accuse you of rooting against the other. Or if you’re from St. Louis and played for the Cardinals, as NBC’s Joe Garagiola did, you are thought to favor teams from Missouri.'"
"'09-11-03,'0','Nearly a week of frustration ended for commuters when the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge reopened after emergency repairs. Traffic began moving across the span after two rods and a crossbar were replaced and passed vibration and other tests, said Bart Ney, a spokesman for the state’s Transportation Department. Cars lined up at the toll plaza shortly before the opening. The first vehicles allowed to cross the bridge’s upper deck were led by a line of California Highway Patrol cars. The span was closed for nearly six days after 5,000 pounds of metal came crashing down into rush-hour traffic Tuesday evening when the rods and crossbar failed. The parts had been installed over the Labor Day weekend to repair a crack. One person sustained minor injuries and three cars were damaged when the metal fell. The new fix includes antivibration dampeners and measures to prevent parts from falling on the bridge if they fail again, Mr. Ney said.'"
"'09-11-03,'0','Patients and doctors should be aware of possible kidney function problems with Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals’ Byetta diabetes drug, federal health regulators said. The Food and Drug Administration received 78 reports of problems with kidney function in patients using Byetta from April 2005 through October 2008. Nearly seven million prescriptions for the drug were written during roughly the same period, so the agency noted the number of kidney problems represented a “small percentage” of the total number of patients on the drug. Nonetheless, the agency approved changes to Byetta’s prescribing label to include information about the kidney function reports.'"
"'09-11-03,'0','The percentage of premiums spent on medical claims is known in industry jargon as the “medical loss ratio.” According to the Senate analysis, the for-profit insurers’ average ratio in 2008 was 84 percent in policies offered to large employers, and 80 percent for small employers — those businesses with 50 or fewer workers.Individuals and small businesses have long complained they get less value for their money. But insurance companies generally do not disclose how much they spend in different segments of the market. The Senate analysis of the figures does not include information from California, because that state’s filings are not available through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.In a letter containing the analysis sent to one of the insurers, Cigna, on Monday, Mr. Rockefeller accused the company of not fully disclosing its spending to regulators.“I believe insurers have an obligation to use consumers’ premium dollars in a way that maximizes the benefit to their policyholders,” he wrote. “I also believe that consumers have the right to know what insurance companies are doing with their money.”He wrote that Cigna “appears to have flouted these requirements and made it more difficult for regulators and consumers to hold you accountable for your conduct.”A Cigna spokesman said that the insurer was looking into the senator’s concerns, but that it had already provided Mr. Rockefeller with information that indicated it spent 93 cents out of every dollar it collected from individuals on medical claims. “Cigna always strives to submit its state insurance regulatory filings timely, accurately and in the manner required by state regulators,” the company said in a statement.Mr. Rockefeller, in his letter, said that an individual shopping for a health insurance policy would benefit from information about the relative value of the plans available, just as someone purchasing a car finds information about gas mileage helpful in choosing models.The insurance industry’s trade group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said Monday that the 87-cent figure it cited as the industry average was based on information collected by the federal government and was an accurate reflection of how much of each dollar in premiums was spent on medical claims.The group supports widespread disclosure of these ratios but said it was opposed to legislation that would require insurers to spend a specific amount on medical claims. And a spokesman for the group argued that the figures were not a measure of how efficient or effective an individual health plan might be.“Having these arbitrary caps will undermine other reform efforts to improve patient care and cut health care costs,” including disease management programs and spending on technology that could not be counted toward medical claims spending said the spokesman, Robert Zirkelbach.In his statement, Mr. Rockefeller said the committee’s analysis “reveals that while health care costs are spiraling upwards, consumers are paying more and getting less, and the insurance industry doesn’t want anyone to know what they are up to.”'"
"'09-11-03,'0','Mr. Boehner said the Republican proposal had none of the taxes or mandates of the Democrats’ bill and would not prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. But, he said, the Republicans would provide more money to states to form high-risk pools, which offer coverage to people who cannot obtain private insurance.Republicans will have only a limited opportunity to influence the Democrats’ bill on the House floor. Under the rules for debate, Republicans will probably not be able to propose amendments other than a complete substitute for the bill, Democrats said.Those rules are sure to anger Republicans, who have been clamoring for a chance to propose changes. But they may also stymie some Democrats who had wanted to propose amendments dealing, for example, with restrictions on abortion.The House Democrats’ bill would offer $600 billion in subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance, most of it from private insurance companies, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The subsidies would be available to people who obtain coverage through a new regulated market known as a health insurance exchange, scheduled to start operation in 2013. Subsidies are based on the amounts charged for low-cost basic plans.Under the House bill, the budget office said, a family of four with income of $78,000 in 2016 would pay, on average, an annual premium of $8,800 and co-payments of $5,000, for a total of $13,800, equivalent to 18 percent of the family’s income.A family of four with income of $90,100 could also receive subsidies. It would pay $11,100 in premiums and $5,500 in cost-sharing, for a total of $16,600, or 18 percent of family income, the budget office said.For lower-income people, the subsidies would be more generous. A family of four with income of $66,000 would pay premiums of $6,300 and cost-sharing of $3,700, for a total of $10,000, or 15 percent of its income in 2016, the budget office said.The budget office did not say how insurance costs under the bill compared with the costs if Congress did nothing. The agency has previously estimated that premiums alone for families buying coverage on their own would average $11,000 in 2016. And that coverage is somewhat less extensive than what would be required by the House bill.In its report on Monday, the budget office noted that the House bill would spend more on subsidies than a bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee. For people receiving subsidies under the House bill, it said, the average subsidy would be $5,800, or $1,000 more than the average under the Senate Finance bill.“The House bill,” the report said, “offers greater subsidies for cost sharing, which would be more valuable to people with health problems and thus would tend to attract a less healthy mix of enrollees.”Moreover, the budget office said, “the House bill restricts more sharply the extent to which premiums can vary by age.” This, it said, would make the insurance exchanges “less attractive to younger people (who tend to have lower health care costs) and more attractive to older people (who tend to have higher health care costs).”Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, endorsed the House bill on Monday, and Democrats cited that as evidence of growing support for the measure. “Health care is a consumer crisis,” said James A. Guest, president of Consumers Union. “By creating a more secure, affordable health care system, the House bill goes a long way toward solving the crisis.”Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said the Democrats’ goal was to achieve universal coverage. By contrast, he said: “Republicans believe the real issue here is cost. When I’m back home in Indiana, people are not stopping me on the street clamoring for universal coverage.”Republicans are particularly opposed to a provision of the House bill that would create a government insurance plan, to compete with private insurers. The Congressional Budget Office said the public plan would attract six million people. But Mr. Boehner said it could lead to a much bigger federal role.“What the left wants to do is to have a single-payer national health care plan,” Mr. Boehner said. “While the government option isn’t exactly that today, all the infrastructure that is being built into the government under this bill is intended to get ready for that.”'"

In one advisory, the C.D.C. encouraged employers “to develop nonpunitive leave policies.”Despite such recommendations, some employees say they have no choice but to go to work sick.When Latisha Carter caught H1N1 from her 6-year-old daughter in June, she suffered headaches, chills and , but she reported to her $13-an-hour help desk job at a insurer nonetheless. The temp agency that placed her does not offer her paid sick days.“If you’re sick, they encourage you to stay home, but I couldn’t afford to take off if I wasn’t going to get paid,” said Ms. Carter, 29, who said she stuck to her small work area to avoid spreading the flu.Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, a group of 30,000 public health professionals, said, “Providing workers with paid sick days is essential if we’re going to get serious about the public health recommendations for swine flu — stay home until 24 hours after your is broken. That usually takes about five days.”For many businesses, H1N1 has created a dilemma. “This is a very difficult issue for companies,” said Nina G. Stillman, a lawyer with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius who advises companies on sick-leave policy. “Employers who do not offer sick days are not prepared to offer them now, and they recognize that this may result in not achieving what they say they would like, which is that people who are sick stay home.”The C.D.C. says that swine flu is widespread in 48 of the 50 states and has already hit as many as 5.7 million Americans.Many worker groups and women’s groups have seized on the H1N1 pandemic to argue that Congress should enact legislation guaranteeing paid sick days. and Washington have enacted such legislation, but similar measures face obstacles in Congress.“Sometimes you talk about legislation in the abstract, but this is making people begin to understand the problem,” said Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of and lead sponsor in the House of a bill, with more than 100 co-sponsors, that would require employers with 15 or more workers to provide seven paid sick days a year.Business groups oppose such legislation, calling it expensive and unnecessary. They say that employers already allow and even encourage sick employees to stay home.“The vast majority of employers provide paid leave of some sort,” said Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce. “The problem is not nearly as great as some people say. Lots of employers work these things out on an ad hoc basis with their employees.”According to the , 39 percent of private-sector workers do not receive paid sick leave.Workers at many retailers and restaurants say their employers’ policies discourage them from calling in sick. At , when employees miss one or more days because of illness or other reasons, they generally get a demerit point. Once employees obtain four points over a six-month period, they begin receiving warnings that can lead to dismissal.In addition, when Wal-Mart employees call in sick, their first day off is not a paid sick day (although workers can use a vacation day or personal day), but the second and third days are paid. The policy is meant to keep workers who are not actually sick from taking a day off to, say, go .Paul Hotchkiss, a support manager at a Wal-Mart store in Hastings, Minn., said the point system pressured him to report to work two weeks ago even though he had swine flu.“There are a lot of people who have swine flu right now who are going in because they worry about getting fired for having too many points,” Mr. Hotchkiss said.His supervisor sent him home because he looked pale, he said, adding that he did not see a doctor because he could not afford the company’s .Wal-Mart officials say the company insists that workers with H1N1 stay home and has policies making it easy to do so.Mandy Pillar, a nurse at Linwood Elementary School in Wichita, Kan., said more than 20 percent of the students were out sick when H1N1 swept through two weeks ago.“We were sending 12 and 15 kids home a day with fever,” she said. “The next day they’d be back. They’d say, ‘I still feel bad. I still have a fever.’ So we’d ask, ‘Why are you back here?’ And they’d say, ‘because Mommy had to work.’ ”A survey last year by the National Opinion Research Center at the found that 68 percent of those not eligible for paid sick days said they had gone to work with a contagious illness like the flu, while 53 percent eligible for paid sick days said they had done so.That survey found that 11 percent of respondents said that they had lost a job for taking off for an illness for themselves or a family member, and 13 percent said they had been told they would be fired or suspended if they missed work because of personal or family illness.Ricardo Copantitla, a food server at Thalassa, a restaurant in the TriBeCa neighborhood of , said he called in sick last year when he had the seasonal flu, not H1N1.“The restaurant said you have to come to work, because they were short of people,” he said. “I had a bad , and I felt tired and terrible. But I went to work because I feared being fired.”Thalassa did not respond to phone and e-mail requests for comment.Like many restaurant chains, White Castle, which runs 421 hamburger restaurants nationwide, says it takes H1N1 seriously.“Our policy is that when team members experience illness, we require that they stay home until they are feeling better,” said Jamie Richardson, White Castle’s vice president for corporate relations. “Our policy provides for time off as people need it.”White Castle does not provide paid sick days, he acknowledged, but he said that workers who stayed home sick would not suffer lost pay because they could work extra hours after recovering.Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, said H1N1 had spurred an attitude shift throughout corporate America.“Before, people looked askance at absenteeism — someone staying out was a problem to the company,” she said. “There was this view that being sick was malingering. But now if someone comes in sick — and there has been subtle pressure to do this — you worry that you can get something very dangerous. You worry that you could bring it home to your children, to your elderly parent, to your husband or wife.”'"
"'09-11-03,'0','Emery added: “Watching the way all this has unfolded makes me believe that it was the stark juxtaposition of Clemens and Pettitte that changed the game. Alex had an easy road because Pettitte showed you exactly what you do when you’re caught.”Will others who made a less judicious choice when they came to a fork in the road learn from Rodriguez?“There has always been a tremendous compulsion in the American DNA to cover up, and lie, going all the way up to the White House,” the former baseball commissioner said. “McGwire got terrible advice, and I think coming back almost certainly leads to him handling this better. But with this issue, it’s so obvious what to do now that maybe it even leads to and Clemens waking up, too.”Partisanship often plays a role in the steroid discussion, one city’s hero being another city’s target of abuse. But across a fairly wide spectrum, Rodriguez has already drawn, beyond leniency, a standing ovation from the court of public opinion.“I never thought Alex Rodriguez was very interesting, but when a sports hero is forced into this admission of wrongdoing, it humanizes him,” said Orin Starn, the cultural department chairman at . “We want these athletes to astonish us, but we also want to imagine them as someone like us.”Flawed and accountable is what he meant. And although Starn said he was not sure Rodriguez’s remorse and confessional version of drug consumption were as sincere and thorough as they might have been, “he made the gesture.”In other words, he did not squander his iconic moment, as McGwire did in 2005 before Congress when he stonewalled upon being asked if he had taken anything beyond over-the-counter supplements. Rodriguez did not go the Clemens-Bonds route by summoning the defiance and machismo that serves so many great athletes between the lines but blinds them to consequences in civilian life.“Because of their immense egos, Clemens and Bonds couldn’t get down on their knees, do a little mea culpa,” said Charles Yesalis, a professor emeritus of health policy and kinesiology at University.Clemens did not learn from the mistakes of Bonds, who failed to grasp the fundamental lesson of ’s continued ban from baseball for betting on games while the ’ manager and being unable to come clean about it for years.Different offense, same stubbornness: instead of using his head, Rose lowered his shoulder, as if running through catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star Game.“I think in some cases, it just comes down to intelligence, and Rodriguez is significantly more intelligent than Clemens and Rose,” Vincent said.In Rodriguez’s case, his personality was always more acquiescent, wanting to please to the point of extremes and creating expectations he could not meet.This season, Rodriguez finally found the answer, seemingly by looking over his left shoulder to his partner on the left side of the infield. Like , he sought the security of simplicity. He lost the public-relations entourage. He lowered his news media profile. He separated himself from and took up with , a more circumspect Hollywood star. He followed through on his spring training pledge to work with Don Hooton, an antisteroid activist whose program is aimed at high-school-age athletes.As part of their agreement, Hooton would not reveal the extent of Rodriguez’s commitment other than to say they had visited several schools. He did recall sitting with Rodriguez at a restaurant in , Fla., last spring, soon after his public admission, the two of them trying to figure out what his message would be.“He kept using the word ‘balanced,’ ” Hooton said. “He said, ‘Don, when I wasn’t using steroids, I always felt more balanced, more whole, than when I did.’ I said, ‘Alex, that’s your message right there.’ Here we are, less than a year later, he’s back to hero status. It’s not all that complicated.”But the steroid debate has been confusing, a continuing argument about how much the public cares or should care. That, Vincent said, is part of a greater cultural problem.“The reason why we can’t find a solution on these things is because there is no clear consensus in this country on what’s wrong in the first place at a time when there is so much that is wrong,” Vincent said.All of which makes baseball, a form of daily escapism from spring through fall, that much more appealing to a population stressed out by a tanked economy, unemployment and unending wars.Athletes may be easier to forgive than politicians who not only cross the ethical line but also fail to deliver in the clutch on budget control and health care. For people inside the stadium or watching on television, uncomplicated resolution is much easier to come by as long as the offender keeps his eye on the ball, and has come clean.“American people are tremendously forgiving,” Yesalis said. “And they don’t ask too much.”'"
"'09-11-03,'0','Bonnie: I know. She is one.Penny: She looks like a big fat cow.Julie: Who is that?Bonnie: That girl on the basketball team.Julie: Oh, yeah. I know. She is a cow.The new study found that gossip in the workplace also tended to be overwhelmingly negative, but the insults were more subtle and the conversations less predictable, says Tim Hallett, a sociologist at Indiana University. Dr. Hallett conducted the study along with Dr. Eder and Brent Harger of Albright College.“Office gossip can be a form of reputational warfare,” Dr. Hallett says. “It’s like informal gossip, but it’s richer and more elaborate. There are more layers to it because people practice indirectness and avoidance. People are more cautious because they know they can lose not just a friendship but a job.”During his two years studying the group dynamics at a Midwestern elementary school, which allowed him access on condition of anonymity, Dr. Hallett found that the teachers became so comfortable with him and his camera that they would freely insult their bosses during one-on-one interviews. But at the teachers’ formal group meetings, where they knew that another teacher might report their insults to the principal, they were more discreet.Instead of making direct criticisms, they sometimes offered obliquely sarcastic comments to test the waters. They used another indirect tactic categorized as praise the predecessor, as in the meeting when a teacher fondly recalled a previous administration: “It was so calm, and you could teach. No one was constantly looking over your shoulder.” The other teachers quickly agreed. No one explicitly called the current principal an authoritarian busybody, but that was the obvious implication.Some teachers were especially adept at managing gossip. At one meeting, after someone complained about a student walking around with his hair shaped into horns (“Tell me, how is that part of the uniform dress code?”), the group began blaming the lapse in discipline on the assistant principal. The gossip seemed to be going down the same nasty track as the teenagers’ she’s-such-a-cow episode until another teacher, an ally of the assistant principal, smoothly intervened.First, the teacher interrupted the attack by asking the name of the student with the horns. That deflected the group’s gossip on to the student’s academic difficulties and weird behavior (“He’s gotta frighten the little kids”). Then the teacher masterfully completed the rescue of the assistant principal by changing the topic entirely, reminding everyone of a different disciplinary issue that was the fault of a less popular administrator — the principal, who promptly became the new focus of the groups’ anger.The teachers’ gossip never got as blatantly mean as the teenage girls’ — no one was ever called a cow — but in some ways the effects were more widely felt.As teachers mocked the principal and complained about her being “stifling” and “hyper,” the atmosphere got more poisonous. The principal felt that her authority was being undermined by gossip and retaliated against teachers she suspected (correctly) of criticizing her. Teachers and administrators fled the school, and the students’ test scores declined.“The gossip did serve to reinforce the teachers’ group solidarity, but in this case it was also a form of warfare that brought everyone down,” Dr. Hallett says. “It was reminiscent of the old saying that gossip is a three-pronged tongue: it can hurt the speaker and the listener, as well as the target.”Some bosses have tried turning the office into a “no-gossip zone,” but Dr. Hallett says it is more realistic to try managing it. (If you have ideas for managing office gossip, you can suggest them at nytimes.com/tierneylab.)If, say, an office rival seems poised to trash one of your absent allies, Dr. Hallett suggests you make a “pre-emptive positive evaluation.” A quick “Isn’t she doing a great job?” might be enough to stop the attack.If your rival tries persisting with indirect sarcasm — “Oh, real great job” — you can force the issue by calmly asking what that means. That simple question, a dare made in a pleasant voice, often silenced the sarcastic gossips observed by Dr. Hallett.And if that doesn’t work, Dr. Hallett suggests you try an even simpler tactic that was used successfully at the teachers’ meetings — and that is available in any workplace anytime. In fact, it’s one of the tactics that distinguishes office gossip from nonoffice gossip. When the going gets tough, when the gossip gets mean, you always have one reliable escape line: “Don’t we have some work to do here?”'"

"'09-11-03,'0','BEIJING — Facing rising criticism over the quality of schools and a crush of jobless college graduates, China’s legislature announced Monday that it had removed the minister of education after six years on the job and replaced him with a deputy.The minister, Zhou Ji, had become a prime target for critics of China’s education system, which has stumbled during breakneck expansion that was intended to raise literacy rates and build a world-class university system.His dismissal follows a corruption scandal involving a university in Wuhan, where Mr. Zhou had been mayor and, before that, president of another university. Mr. Zhou has not been publicly linked to the corruption charges, which remain under investigation.The government-run Chinese-language press reported Mr. Zhou’s removal on Monday largely without comment in summarizing the work of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, the legislature whose delegates are largely elected by Communist Party leaders and the military.Mr. Zhou’s dismissal was described more fully in an official English-language newspaper, China Daily, which said the education system had been “plagued with problems, such as underfunding of primary and secondary schools and poor standards in higher education.”'"

"'09-11-03,'0','Mr. Boehner said the Republican proposal had none of the taxes or mandates of the Democrats’ bill and would not prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. But, he said, the Republicans would provide more money to states to form high-risk pools, which offer coverage to people who cannot obtain private insurance.Republicans will have only a limited opportunity to influence the Democrats’ bill on the House floor. Under the rules for debate, Republicans will probably not be able to propose amendments other than a complete substitute for the bill, Democrats said.Those rules are sure to anger Republicans, who have been clamoring for a chance to propose changes. But they may also stymie some Democrats who had wanted to propose amendments dealing, for example, with restrictions on abortion.The House Democrats’ bill would offer $600 billion in subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance, most of it from private insurance companies, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The subsidies would be available to people who obtain coverage through a new regulated market known as a health insurance exchange, scheduled to start operation in 2013. Subsidies are based on the amounts charged for low-cost basic plans.Under the House bill, the budget office said, a family of four with income of $78,000 in 2016 would pay, on average, an annual premium of $8,800 and co-payments of $5,000, for a total of $13,800, equivalent to 18 percent of the family’s income.A family of four with income of $90,100 could also receive subsidies. It would pay $11,100 in premiums and $5,500 in cost-sharing, for a total of $16,600, or 18 percent of family income, the budget office said.For lower-income people, the subsidies would be more generous. A family of four with income of $66,000 would pay premiums of $6,300 and cost-sharing of $3,700, for a total of $10,000, or 15 percent of its income in 2016, the budget office said.The budget office did not say how insurance costs under the bill compared with the costs if Congress did nothing. The agency has previously estimated that premiums alone for families buying coverage on their own would average $11,000 in 2016. And that coverage is somewhat less extensive than what would be required by the House bill.In its report on Monday, the budget office noted that the House bill would spend more on subsidies than a bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee. For people receiving subsidies under the House bill, it said, the average subsidy would be $5,800, or $1,000 more than the average under the Senate Finance bill.“The House bill,” the report said, “offers greater subsidies for cost sharing, which would be more valuable to people with health problems and thus would tend to attract a less healthy mix of enrollees.”Moreover, the budget office said, “the House bill restricts more sharply the extent to which premiums can vary by age.” This, it said, would make the insurance exchanges “less attractive to younger people (who tend to have lower health care costs) and more attractive to older people (who tend to have higher health care costs).”Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, endorsed the House bill on Monday, and Democrats cited that as evidence of growing support for the measure. “Health care is a consumer crisis,” said James A. Guest, president of Consumers Union. “By creating a more secure, affordable health care system, the House bill goes a long way toward solving the crisis.”Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said the Democrats’ goal was to achieve universal coverage. By contrast, he said: “Republicans believe the real issue here is cost. When I’m back home in Indiana, people are not stopping me on the street clamoring for universal coverage.”Republicans are particularly opposed to a provision of the House bill that would create a government insurance plan, to compete with private insurers. The Congressional Budget Office said the public plan would attract six million people. But Mr. Boehner said it could lead to a much bigger federal role.“What the left wants to do is to have a single-payer national health care plan,” Mr. Boehner said. “While the government option isn’t exactly that today, all the infrastructure that is being built into the government under this bill is intended to get ready for that.”'"

There is a chance the Obama administration will encourage investment by the highly regulated railroad industry. On another view, any emphasis on energy self-sufficiency could spur new coal-fired power plants, which in turn could increase the volume of coal shipments.Yet the trucking industry, suffering from overcapacity, is not going to give up without a fight. And a recovery will take time, especially for the transportation segments that relate to consumer products. At best, Mr. Buffett’s fully priced deal will bear fruit only over time. Short-term followers in the sector could be disappointed.Johnson & Johnson has found merger-size savings — in itself. The health care giant will eliminate about 8,000 jobs. But the benefits are likely to be as fleeting as the cuts accompanying most giant pharmaceutical mergers. That is because it is increasingly tough to find new drugs to replace lost revenue as sales of old products run down.True, it sounds impressive when any business can figure out how to cut $1.7 billion annually from its budget. In mergers, such savings are commonplace. And J.& J. is coming up with its projected cost cuts without the disruption that inevitably occurs when two big firms are slammed together. In theory, the potential value today of these cuts after tax would be more than $12 billion. Yet investors sliced $1.5 billion off J.& J.’s market value on the announcement Tuesday. What gives?Unfortunately the cuts cannot be considered in isolation. The costs and risks of discovering drugs and getting them to market have surged. To deal with this, J.& J. increasingly relies upon research partnerships, like its deal this year with the biotech firm Elan. These pacts mean a lesser share for J.& J. shareholders in the fruits of any success.This just adds to J.& J.’s problem with sales declines resulting from the loss of patent protection on its drug portfolio. For example, sales of the migraine treatment Topamax fell to $175 million in the third quarter this year, from $728 million last year. Sales of the antipsychotic Risperdal fell 40 percent over the same period, to $192 million. Combined, these accounted for much of J.& J.’s overall decline in third-quarter revenue.Its drug business had operating margins of 31 percent, almost double the profitability of its consumer arm. This highlights J.& J.’s so-called operating leverage: once costs are covered, additional sales are highly profitable. Yet, this cuts both ways.Look no further than J.& J.’s counseling of analysts not to raise their estimates of the company’s margins as a result of the new cost cuts. Put simply, margins — and profits — would have declined without these measures. Despite the scope of the layoffs, it is roughly a wash for shareholders.'"

They’re always wondering if they’re doing the right thing, indulging in on-the-one-hand, on-the-other by analysis, seeing, as put it, “six sides to the Pentagon.”will have to step it up on jobs and fixing the deficit if he wants to block conservatives from stoking the anger of Americans who only see a recovery on Wall Street, especially given the Republican sweep in top races on Tuesday night.But the tactics of Limbaugh, Palin, Cheney & Fille are more cynical: They spin certainty, ignoring their side’s screw-ups, and they exploit patriotism, labeling all critics as traitors.In an interview on “Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace,” Limbaugh accused the president of trying to destroy the economy — yes, the same economy that W. came within a whisker of ruining.“I have to think that it may be on purpose,” Limbaugh said, “because this is just outrageous, what is happening — a denial of liberty, an attack on freedom.”Asked about , another W. cataclysm that has left Obama agonizing, Limbaugh stated, “I also don’t think he cares much about it.” Again suggesting that the president is an unpatriotic fop, the radio ranter averred: “He wants to manage this rather than achieve victory.”He told Wallace that “throughout the war, it was and the Democrat Party which actively sought the defeat of the U.S. military.” Actually, rigorously examining the government’s conduct of a war started on false pretenses is the best sort of patriotism.Asked about fellow conservative ’s contention that the should get out of Afghanistan, Limbaugh said, “I don’t have the benefit of knowledge that George Will has, so I trust the experts, and to me they’re the people in the U.S. military.”Even a chickenhawk like Rush should remember how well that worked in , or in the early years of Iraq. The founding fathers designated a civilian as commander in chief for a reason.Military brass have told the White House that this is the first time in eight years that they have gotten the attention and resources that they’ve needed in Afghanistan.If W. had gone to Dover in the middle of the night to salute the war dead, Limbaugh and would have been gushing about his patriotism.But since it’s Obama who at last showed up there to see the brutal cost of war, they simply have to dismiss the moving moment as a publicity stunt.Years ago, when I dubbed Dubya “The Boy Emperor,” Limbaugh spewed a stream of personal invective about me that embarrassed even my mother, a Limbaugh fan.But now Limbaugh calls Obama the “man-child president.”The 48-year-old Obama is skinny and getting skinnier, but there’s nothing childish about him. He more or less raised himself and came to terms with his Oedipal demons on his own, and he radiates a hard-won maturity.W., on the other hand, was like a kid who knew that Daddy’s friends would take care of him; he was always running off to the gym or going , leaving the governing to his regents, Cheney and Rummy, or incompetents like Brownie.At our long-ago dinner, Limbaugh credited his success with being “one-dimensional.” “I’m totally concerned with me,” he said. And that was way before he got a contract for $400 million, so we can only imagine how one-dimensional he is now.But on Sunday, he ripped the president for having “an out-of-this-world ego,” for being “very narcissistic,” “immature, inexperienced, in over his head.” (Isn’t immaturity scoring OxyContin from your maid?)It gives new meaning to pot, kettle and black.'"
"'09-11-04,'1','“I don’t want to sound like smart or nothing, but I’m probably going to use him the way I want to, when we get there and how I feel,” Manuel said of Lidge. Then, referring to the pitching coach Rich Dubee, he said, “I’ll do a lot of talking in the dugout with Dubee, and we’ll decide on which one we want to put out there.”As much as Manuel said he wanted to rest Lidge, who he said may have been mentally taxed, there may have been no better situation in which to insert him than in Game 5: with the Phillies leading by three runs at home. Any save opportunity at Yankee Stadium will present more of a challenge.“I sure do,” said Manuel, when asked if he still had confidence in Lidge, who blew 11 saves during the regular season. “I think the only thing I’m trying to do with Brad Lidge is get him right. You know what, I’ll always have confidence in him. He’s got a lot of talent, and he proved that last year when he goes 48 for 48 in save situations.”Through the National League playoffs, Phillies relievers had defined roles in the late innings: Madson in the eighth, Lidge in the ninth, and fingers crossed all the way.Then came Game 4. After baffling the first two hitters, Lidge was one strike from ushering the Phillies into the bottom of the ninth with the score tied at 4-4 before a single, a hit batter, a double and a single produced an outcome that Philadelphia fans had long feared.Until Sunday, Lidge had pitched four scoreless innings across five playoff appearances, converting all three save chances.But that night, as his fearsome slider dived with the same bite as last season, when he never blew a save and the Phillies won the World Series, Lidge inexplicably switched and pumped mostly fastballs to Alex Rodriguez and Jorge Posada, who delivered the run-scoring hits. Lidge later said he should have started throwing his slider sooner.If a similar situation presents itself Wednesday, Manuel, as he did during a stretch in September, may play for a favorable matchup. One of Madson’s strengths is his changeup, a terrific neutralizing pitch against left-handed hitters. Depending on who is due to bat for the Yankees, Manuel could use a combination of Madson and Lidge in the ninth.The likelihood of that, though, hinges on whether Pedro Martinez, the Game 6 starter, pitches long enough so Manuel does not have to use his bullpen earlier than desired. The only pitchers Manuel will refrain from using Wednesday are Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels, who would almost certainly start a potential Game 7.“Might be exactly what we’re going to do,” said Manuel, who added, “But we don’t look back and we don’t look ahead.”The Yankees have that luxury because their late-inning bullpen jobs are more defined. Joba Chamberlain and Damaso Marte have assumed leading roles in bridging the outs to their indomitable closer, Mariano Rivera.Since throwing 39 pitches in a two-inning save in Game 2, Rivera needed a total of 13 pitches to dispatch the Phillies in the Yankees’ other two victories. With a light workload and two consecutive days off, Rivera would be poised to pitch two innings, if needed, in Game 6.If the Yankees are leading and anyone but Rivera pitches the final two innings, it will be a tremendous surprise. That is why the Yankees have him, after all.Manuel used to know that Madson and Lidge would pitch the eighth and the ninth. They still may. But in which order, nobody knows.Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino, hit in the right hand by a pitch in Game 5, had the hand re-examined, and Charlie Manuel said he did not know if Victorino would be available for Game 6.'"

"'09-11-04,'1','In the wispy documentary “Act of God,” survivors of lightning strikes find metaphysical meaning in meteorological phenomena. The writer Paul Auster begs to differ.Minus Mr. Auster’s pointed pragmatism, this insubstantial — if occasionally lovely — film would feel as random as its subject matter.His childhood recollections of a summer camp tragedy, when a close friend was killed during an “absolutely meaningless” storm, bracket stories shadowed by survivor guilt and ennobled by divine interpretation. While others recount into-the-light experiences (including a former Marine and self-described bully who now runs an end-of-life care organization), Mr. Auster channels his sadness into words that provide an eloquent counterweight to the film’s unfocused mysticism.Meditating on the human propensity for employing what Mr. Auster calls “magical thinking” to interpret natural disasters, “Act of God” is philosophically ripe but cinematically undercooked. Interviewing survivors from London to Las Vegas and from Cuba to Mexico, the director, Jennifer Baichwal, steadfastly ignores the cultural contexts that inform their reactions, thereby depriving her film of much-needed significance.This problem is underscored by an overlong sequence following the playwright James O’Reilly as he self-consciously re-enacts his own lightning encounter: memories of a friend’s coughed-up lung tissue may be horrifying but they do nothing to clarify the movie’s intent.In her previous film, “Manufactured Landscapes,” Ms. Baichwal transformed industrial waste into visual gold. Here she’s so busy watching the skies she forgets to bring her gaze back to earth.'"
"'09-11-04,'1','The online price war that broke out last month among Wal-Mart, Amazon and Target took a new turn on Tuesday with Wal-Mart continuing to play the penny game. At first, Amazon appeared to be the low-price player when it extended its $9 price tag to three hardcover books that were officially released Nov. 3. Amazon had originally offered that price in response to price-cutting by Wal-Mart on its Web site for preorders of 10 titles that included the three that were released Tuesday: “Ford County” by John Grisham, “The Lacuna” by Barbara Kingsolver and “Kindred in Death” by J. D. Robb. As of Tuesday morning, Amazon still had those titles priced at $9 while Wal-Mart, which had offered them on preorder at $8.98, and Target, which had offered preorders for $8.99, had raised their prices. At Walmart.com, for example, “Ford County” was selling for $12, while “The Lacuna” was $13.50. At Target.com, “The Lacuna” was on sale for $18.89 and “Kindred in Death” was $17. But by late morning, Amazon had raised its prices — “The Lacuna” and “Kindred in Death,” for example, were offered for $13.50 — while Walmart.com had cut them again. All three novels that went on sale Tuesday were on sale at Walmart.com for $8.99, but by the afternoon, Walmart.com had raised its prices to just one penny lower than the price for the three titles on Amazon. In an e-mailed statement, a spokeswoman for Walmart.com said that it would “continue to adjust our pricing accordingly and as needed on these books.”'"
"'09-11-04,'1','Most telling, and perhaps most damning, said the Iran expert Rasool Nafisi, is the reformists’ increasingly popular slogan. It is, simply, “Iranian republic.”“The threat of falling off course and losing the spirit of the revolution looms over us,” wrote Massumeh Ebtekar in her blog, Persian Paradox, in June, just after the presidential election. Ms. Ebtekar was the public face of the siege, serving as spokeswoman for the hostage-takers. She provided regular updates on the hostages she referred to as “guests of the ayatollah,” 52 of whom were held for the full 444 days.Today, she informally represents the views of many of the former hostage-takers. There were hundreds of students involved, but among the leaders, there tends to be a consensus on certain points, Iran experts said.While they are not pro-Western, they support engagement with the West. They often talk about the original ideals of the revolution, including justice and freedom, which they say the state has abandoned — especially in its violent crackdown on the recent election protests, which echoed the harsh actions of the Savak, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi’s hated and feared secret police.The 1979 takeover was led by a group that called itself the Muslim Followers of the Line of the Imam. They were politically radical, mostly self-described leftists and anti-imperialists, as well as Islamists. In later years, the brain trust of the reform movement emerged from their ranks. Among them were Abbas Abdi, a chief adviser to the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, who was later jailed for two years; Saeed Hajjarian, a journalist and reform leader who was released from prison in October after months behind bars; and Mohsen Aminzadeh, a deputy foreign minister in the Khatami years, who is still imprisoned.Speaking Tuesday in her capacity as a member of the Tehran City Council, Ms. Ebtekar said, “We have to ask why students who were called national heroes by the imam are now suffering these circumstances.”The political turmoil that followed the election has highlighted how power politics has evolved since the popular uprising that ousted the shah three decades ago. Power has shifted from the old revolutionaries to a new generation associated with the Iran-Iraq war and the Revolutionary Guards, a military force whose mandate is to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the revolution.That new political elite is often at odds with the founding fathers, like former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; the government’s most outspoken critic, Mehdi Karroubi, who is a former presidential candidate and two-term speaker of Parliament. Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a political science professor at Syracuse University and an expert on Iran, said, “Mirdamadi is now sitting in jail, and of course this again, more than anything, testifies to how that initial consensus in Iran of 1979 and 1980 has broken and has dissipated.”Mr. Abdi has kept a low profile lately, offering little publicly except some support for the Green Movement of the other main reform leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi.Like other hostage-takers he did not apologize for the embassy takeover. He said he thought it was necessary — at the time.But he filled with remorse for what came of it.“I don’t call it the revolution just because they call it the revolution,” he said in 2006. “It is despotism. No despot admits he is one. They usually claim they are democrats.”A leader in the Iranian political opposition leader who had been a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Tuesday became the first senior cleric to denounce the takeover of the United States Embassy in 1979.“The occupation of the embassy, which was approved by Ayatollah Khomeini and I and the majority of people, caused very negative consequences in the United States, and it showed that it was not a right thing to do,” the cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hussein Montazeri, wrote in a statement posted on his Web site.He added, “Many of those revolutionary youth who were responsible for the action also acknowledge that they made a mistake.”Ayatollah Montazeri was a close ally of Ayatollah Khomeini and was at one time viewed as his successor as supreme leader. He went on to become one of the most prominent critics of the Islamic republic and spent years under house arrest in the city of Qum.'"
"'09-11-04,'1','Through October, drug makers had said they planned to cut nearly 58,700 jobs, more than 60 percent higher than in the comparable period last year.Health care companies still have growth opportunities if they can come up with new treatments for conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, but the industry needs new approaches to capitalize on them, William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, said in a call with analysts on Tuesday.The company’s overhaul plan, Mr. Weldon said, is meant to reduce layers of management and streamline decision making, to let the company devote more resources to investing in innovative medical products and bringing them to market.The company said that it planned to take a special pretax restructuring charge in the current quarter of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, but that it also expected the job cuts and other reduced expenditures to result in long-term savings.The company said it expected pretax cost savings next year of $800 million to $900 million. And in 2011, when the reorganization is completed, it expects pretax cost savings of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion.An analyst’s report from Credit Suisse on Tuesday said the absolute savings would amount to 3 to 4 percent of the company’s total spending for 2009.“The plans and associated savings we are announcing today,” Mr. Weldon said during the call, “will increase our operational efficiency and allow us to continue growing our strong core businesses and ensure the success of new products that are launching or pending approval in the near term.”Job cuts at the company would be global, he said, and were likely to be heavier outside of the United States. A spokesman said the company would not comment on how the job cuts would play out across the company’s drug, device and consumer divisions.Within the industry, many of the major pharmaceutical companies are facing patent expirations on their billion-dollar blockbuster drugs that will expose them to competition from cheaper generics. Meanwhile, a slow and expensive drug development process, in which it often takes more than a decade and costs more than $1 billion to bring a new medicine to market, has slowed down product pipelines.Besides economic and business pressures, health care companies are also under increased scrutiny by federal regulators and lawmakers.The increased emphasis by regulators on safety, analysts said, has resulted in a longer, costlier, more complicated approval process for prescription drugs — a business from which Johnson & Johnson derived $24.6 billion of its $63.7 billion total revenue last year, from drugs like Remicade, a treatment for plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.And the makers of medical devices are not exempt from increased government attention. Johnson & Johnson generated about 36 percent of its overall revenue last year from devices that include knee and hip replacements, sutures, and contact lenses.The Food and Drug Administration recently said it had asked an independent group of scientific experts to review the agency’s vetting of medical devices. And, to help pay for the cost of a Congressional overhaul of the health care system, some lawmakers have called for the makers of medical devices to pay billions in extra taxes over the next decade.“Companies with massive global infrastructure are asking themselves if they can get the job done in more efficient ways,” said Rick Wise, an analyst who covers Johnson & Johnson for Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank.For major drug makers that announced mergers this year, efficiency is a code for word for cuts to eliminate overlapping jobs. The $68 billion merger of the drug giants Pfizer and Wyeth, completed last month, is expected to result in a work force reduction of 15 percent, or about 19,500 jobs.The $41.1 billion merger of Merck and Schering-Plough, which was expected to be completed late Tuesday afternoon, is projected to result eventually in the elimination of 16,000 jobs.Eli Lilly, which bought the biotech company ImClone Systems last year for $6.5 billion, recently said it planned to reduce its work force to 35,000 — a loss of about 5,500 jobs — by 2011. But Johnson & Johnson may be in a better position to weather challenges than many of its competitors, analysts said.It has promising new products — this year, the F.D.A. approved four of the company’s new drugs, including Simponi for rheumatoid arthritis and Stelara for psoriasis.And the company recently bought 18 percent stakes in Elan and Crucell, two innovative smaller companies with which Johnson & Johnson plans to develop, respectively, Alzheimer’s drugs and vaccines.Moreover, as a diversified company that markets surgical devices and consumer products as well as drugs, Johnson & Johnson is less exposed to pressures unique to the pharmaceutical industry, analysts said.Shares of Johnson & Johnson closed at $58.93 Tuesday, down 56 cents.'"

"'09-11-05,'0','In an Impressionist and modern art sale that had all the right ingredients — quality, value and variety — Sotheby’s salesroom was teeming on Wednesday night with a United Nations of enthusiastic bidders from Latin America, China, the United States, Russia and elsewhere in Europe.The results surprised even the auction house. In a little over two hours it sold $181.7 million worth of art, well above its high $163 million estimate. Of the 66 works offered, only 10 failed to sell.The sale stood in stark contrast to the tepid one at Christie’s the night before that brought just $65.6 million. And where bidding was thin at Christie’s, the opposite was true on Wednesday night: often many collectors vied for a work, pushing prices far beyond their estimates in several cases.When a Giacometti sculpture, “L’Homme Qui Chavire,” came up for sale, for example, six bidders sought the work, which was conceived in 1950 and cast a year later. It was being sold by S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate who owns Condé Nast, which has recently undergone layoffs. Before the auction, dealers said Mr. Newhouse had paid about $20 million. He may not have made back all his money, but he came close. With a high estimate of $12 million, it went for $17.2 million, or $19.3 million with Sotheby’s commission.Another work that exceeded expectations was a colorful Fauve seascape by Derain from around 1905. Guy Bennett, who left Christie’s in the summer and is now a private dealer, could be seen talking on a cellphone, determined to beat out three other contenders. He paid $14 million for the painting, well above its high $8 million estimate. The price was a record for the artist at auction.'"

"'09-11-05,'0','The rising sun over the Koolau Mountains cast a glow upon the ballistic missiles planted on the lawn of a submarine museum at the edge of Pearl Harbor, throwing long shadows across the water. They pointed at the bone-white memorial to the U.S.S. Arizona and, just beyond it, at the still-floating battleship Missouri, about to leave her pier.It’s not every year that you get to see a World War II battleship on the move. Particularly in the heart of Pearl Harbor, along what used to be Battleship Row, ground zero for the carnage of Dec. 7, 1941. The sight drew me and about 50 other people to the water’s edge just after dawn on Oct. 14.The Missouri, mothballed for years, was towed to Hawaii from Washington in 1998 to be a bookend to the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, symbols of Japan’s surprise attack and abject defeat. The Arizona was blown up and lies at the harbor bottom, a tomb for her crew. The Missouri sailed triumphant into Tokyo Bay in 1945; surrender papers were signed on her deck.Rusting and leaky, the Missouri was being towed to dry dock for three months of repairs. As per the aphorism, turning her took a little while. Shortly after 7 a.m., she came into full broadside view, then swung around. From head-on, 16-inch guns bristling, she looked like every fat-bellied battle wagon in every newsreel you ever saw. In the foreground, she was dwarfed by the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan.The Pearl Harbor shipyard resurrected the Pacific fleet in the months after Dec. 7 and is doing the same for the Missouri. But whatever conflicts lie ahead for the Pacific Command, the Missouri will not be involved. Among other repairs, a local paper reported, she is getting a new tent on her fantail, “for parties and other revenue-generating events.”It would never be good to get misty-eyed about World War II, whose horrors will cast shadows to eternity. But it is possible to appreciate and even honor its relics, like the sea-changed Arizona, and makeshift monuments, like Mighty Mo. Once it was the deadliest instrument of all-out war, now it is tamed and a gathering place for tourists, sailors and schoolchildren.'"
"'09-11-05,'0','A much-anticipated audit of the Federal Housing Administration was abruptly postponed just before it was supposed to be made public, after questions arose about its accuracy.The auditor, Integrated Financial Engineering, said it notified the F.H.A. late Tuesday that its computer models were creating unexplained inconsistencies. A news conference scheduled for Wednesday morning was canceled.The delay came amid broad public concern about the financial condition of the F.H.A., and appeared likely to add to questions about whether the agency is running excessive risks with taxpayers’ money.The annual audit calculates the solvency of the agency’s insurance fund under a range of possible economic assumptions. F.H.A. officials have insisted that even in a worst case, where home prices continue to fall and many more F.H.A.-insured loans go into foreclosure, the agency will not need a taxpayer bailout.Spokesmen for the F.H.A. and Integrated Financial said it was not clear whether there would be changes in the report’s conclusions. “We are still analyzing,” said Barry Dennis, Integrated Financial’s president.'"
"'09-11-05,'0','His election gave hope to the state’s Republicans, whose party was nearly written off a year ago, that they can still win the support of so-called Reagan Democrats and independent voters.Mr. Christie was praised by Republican leaders, including Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the national party chairman, Michael Steele, for his decisive defeat of Gov. Jon S. Corzine despite being outspent two to one.He faces some of the most daunting challenges in decades: high unemployment, a projected $8 billion deficit, a suffocating tax burden, crumbling roadways, an impatient electorate and a Democratic Legislature that could be as loath to help him succeed as Republicans in Congress have been to aid President Obama.He acknowledged the dimensions of the state’s economic crisis. “We’ve got a lot to do and we know it,” he said. “The reality of last night sinks in slowly.”Still, Mr. Christie, who warmed New Jerseyans with his love of diners and Bruce Springsteen songs, brings distinct advantages to the job. He is not beholden to public unions and he kept his campaign promises vague, and his forceful persona and prosecutorial style offer a sharp contrast to the weak public perception of his predecessor.“His first task will have to be to make New Jersey’s governor the most powerful governor’s office in the country again,” said Pete McDonough, a top adviser to former Gov. Christie Whitman, the last Republican to win the job. “Corzine ceded the agenda to the Legislature very early. Christie’s got to be the new sheriff in town. If you’re really in charge, you can instill a sense of reality in Trenton: ‘I’m going to change it, and you’re not going to stop me.’”Mr. Christie, however, strove to sound conciliatory on Wednesday. “Am I willing to fight? Of course I am,” he said. “I’m not a wallflower. But I don’t go in with that attitude.”But having vanquished Mr. Corzine in Democratic areas like Gloucester County, the home of the incoming State Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, Mr. Christie has a strong hand to play, Mr. McDonough said. “He can turn to the Democrats in the Legislature and say, ‘Guys, your people supported me,’ ” he said.The new governor’s biggest obstacle will be an economy in which jobs keep disappearing and foreclosures keep rising.“Things are not as bad here as in Florida or California, the housing bust states, or the legacy automotive states,” said James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Policy at Rutgers. “But people are going to want jobs, and a lot of focus is going to be on how effective he can be in getting job growth to resume.”Dan Clifton, a veteran Republican budget analyst, said there were few options for major spending cuts by the state, short of privatizing the prisons or selling off assets like the toll roads, which Mr. Corzine attempted in a disastrous political failure.“How does he not cut tax rebates?” Mr. Clifton said, referring to Mr. Christie’s campaign promise to restore the yearly checks to many homeowners that went by the wayside in this year’s budget. “The campaign is over. It’s time to think about governing.”Ed Rollins, the Republican strategist who worked for Mrs. Whitman in 1993, said Mr. Christie would have a short honeymoon. “But if he can clean up New Jersey, which has been known for being corrupt and inefficient, at the end of the day he’s a national player,” he said.Still, Mr. Christie’s communication skills and Jersey-guy affability could help him make his case to the public. After aristocrats like Thomas H. Kean and Mrs. Whitman, technocrats like Jim Florio and James E. McGreevey, and the Manhattan-centric Mr. Corzine, the state is getting a governor many New Jersey residents can identify with.“If you think of how we view ourselves, that’s Chris Christie,” said Bill Baroni, a Republican state senator and close ally. “This is a guy who drives the turnpike, who knows every word to every song ever written by Springsteen, who loves his wife, who he met in college, and who moved back from college to his home state. He just loves New Jersey, and that came across.”'"
"'09-11-05,'0','Consumer groups said the provision had no place in a bill that its sponsors say is supposed to help protect investors.“The supporters of this amendment, including apparently the White House, have suggested that weakening protections against accounting fraud is justified in order to promote job growth,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. “That is precisely the sort of thinking that landed us in the current mess and precisely the sort of thinking Democrats criticized when they were blaming Republicans for the current financial crisis.”The bill, part of a broader effort to overhaul the regulatory system in response to the crisis in the financial markets, would provide new powers and increased resources to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legislation, approved 41 to 28, would give the commission the authority to end mandatory arbitration agreements that investors must sign with their brokers and financial advisers. And it would establish a whistle-blower bounty program for Wall Street employees.The vote cleared the way for the committee to begin considering a plan by Mr. Frank and the administration to give the government broad new powers to shift the cost of rescues of big financial institutions from taxpayers to other large companies.The legislation tries to respond to the outcry over taxpayer bailouts of some of the nation’s biggest financial companies, including Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the American International Group, Citigroup and Bank of America.The measure, directed at institutions whose troubles might pose risks to the financial system, would create a powerful oversight council, led by the Treasury secretary and composed of top regulators, to set policy and tougher regulations for the largest companies and mediate disputes between federal agencies. It would also give the Federal Reserve a lead role in directly supervising many of the largest financial conglomerates.The legislation accelerating the effective date of the credit card law was approved 331 to 92 after lawmakers criticized companies that had moved to raise rates and fees before the new law takes effect. The law, passed last May, would require banks and card companies to give 45 days’ notice before changing interest rates. The law also makes it harder to issue credit cards to students and prevents companies from charging fees to those who exceed their credit limit.Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York and the sponsor of the measure, said it would prevent issuers of credit cards from “getting in under the wire with a last gasp of unfair practices.”Industry executives, however, said the move could backfire by prompting companies to restrict the availability of credit at a time when the economy is in a recession.“This will create significant confusion for consumers and will further restrict access to credit for both consumers and small businesses, all to the detriment of the broader economy,” said Kenneth J. Clayton, a senior vice president at the American Bankers Association.'"

"'09-11-05,'0','DAKAR, Senegal — Thousands of victims of one of the worst toxic dumping scandals in years could lose their hard-won settlement thanks to maneuverings by a shadowy but “influential” figure in Ivory Coast, where the dumping occurred, the victims’ lawyer said Wednesday.Up to $45 million in compensation is at stake, intended for about 30,000 victims of an oil-based sludge surreptitiously dumped around Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s capital, in 2006. The tanker’s poisonous shipment has become notorious as a kind of African Bhopal, an example of a multinational corporation’s negligence in the third world.The waste was shipped by Trafigura, an international commodities trading giant. About 108,000 people sought treatment for nausea, headaches, vomiting and abdominal pains, and at least 15 died. All had apparently been poisoned by the toxic brew of gasoline and caustic soda, refining byproducts dumped by Trafigura’s contractor.The company agreed to pay the Ivorian government about $200 million in 2007, then settled separately with the victims in September of this year. But now the money, frozen in a local bank, has been claimed by a largely self-appointed community representative named Claude Gohourou. In recent weeks, the Ivorian judiciary has sided with him, according to the London law firm Leigh Day & Company, which represents the victims.Behind the representative is “a highly influential figure within Ivorian judicial and financial circles,” who offered to clear up the roadblocks to the money’s distribution “if I agreed to the interest being paid to him,” Martyn Day, senior partner of Leigh Day, said in a statement filed in British courts Wednesday. “I of course refused to have anything to do with such blatant corruption.”'"
"'09-11-05,'0','Margaret Barton, executive director of the National Women’s Business Council, a bipartisan federal advisory group that helped pay for the research, will be doing the same thing. “It certainly strengthens our hand,” Ms. Barton said.“We’ve never done a study like this before,” Ms. Barton said of the report, which was also underwritten by Wal-Mart Stores. “We’d seen anecdotally about the number of women entrepreneurs. This is a confirmation of that.”The economic impact report, Ms. Barton said, offers “recognition on the Hill and in the marketplace that women are doing much more than holding baby-sitting jobs, or proofreading papers or knitting macramé wall hangings.”But, she acknowledged, “it’s the glass half full,” citing a finding in the report that only 20 percent of women-owned businesses had employees. She said she would like to see those numbers increase. “We see that as an area of great growth and opportunity.”Ms. Martin agreed that that should be a priority. Most private and public programs focus on starting a business, she said. While those programs are still important, she said, “we need to really teach how to grow a business,” which requires different skills and motivations.“Women really have to fall in love with running a business,” she said. “They have to move in to the stage about being excited and motivated by running a business. We need help with that area.”Letty Hudson, president of Chicago Mini Bus Travel, is a prime example of the owner these groups are trying to spur on. She recently attended a meeting of Women Impacting Public Policy, a national bipartisan nonprofit group, trying to find ways to increase her business activity, which is down this year. While participants learned of the research on women and business, Ms. Hudson was able to share her own experience.She spoke of how she had created an “inner circle” group of five people whose mission was to make strategic contacts, and of how successful the group had been. “It’s a new way of doing business,” Ms. Hudson said. “Let’s help each other. Look at our own history and go back and connect people.”After she finished, a participant at her table asked her to run a national bus tour. That happened, she said, “just from me sitting there explaining how we can connect.”“Business as usual has changed,” she said. Relationships are now the key, she said. “This is the new wave on how we change the economy.”Ms. Hudson runs a business that produces revenue of more than $1 million.Ms. Barton, of the business council, said that she and others were particularly concerned about helping the “missing middle,” the majority of business owners who struggle to push annual revenue past $50,000.“We need to continue to look at that point on the spectrum,” she said. “We do well starting them out and encourage them at the top with mentoring, but it’s the missing middle we need to help nourish.”Since 1999, Count Me In for Women’s Economic Independence, a nonprofit organization founded by Nell Merlino, who created the Take Our Daughters to Work campaign, has concentrated its efforts on helping businesses owned by women grow. Count Me In runs a program called Make Mine a Million $ Business, which attracts hundreds of businesses each year hoping to reach the $1 million revenue threshold.In the third quarter, the leader board — the program is a yearlong race — showed that revenue for the top 25 businesses had grown 30 percent from a year earlier and that employment, along with the use of contract workers, had increased 86 percent, Ms. Merlino said.Even in this tough climate, she said, these women are moving forward. “This tells me that for all the focus the administration has on getting money moving, it is important, but it is not the only thing. It’s got to be more about the middle — it’s where the jobs come.”“The reason most business don’t grow, but particularly women, is they try to do everything themselves,” Ms. Merlino said. “Here you have this economic calamity — the most important thing to do is to hire people.” With 10 million out of work, she added, there is an extraordinary labor pool.Colette Chapman, president of Chapman Concierge, based in Morristown, N.J., which works with corporations and residential management companies to provide services to employees and residents, took advantage of that talent this year, hiring a former chief financial officer and a former equities trader. “Two years ago, I would never found that caliber of employees,” Ms. Chapman said. “They would never have consider doing it.”The recession has been good for her in other ways as well, she said, as overworked clients have taken advantage of her residential and corporate concierge services.She joined the Make Mine a Million challenge this year at the $344,000 revenue mark, hoping to raise that to $450,000 or higher. “I set the bar high,” Ms. Chapman said. “We’ll be very, very close.”'"
"'09-11-05,'0','BANGKOK — A senior American diplomat who completed a rare visit to Myanmar on Wednesday said that Washington would improve relations with the nation if its military government embraced reconciliation with Myanmar’s democratic opposition.“We stated clearly that the United States is prepared to take steps to improve the relationship, but that the process must be based on reciprocal and concrete efforts by the Burmese government,” the diplomat, Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said in a statement before boarding a plane for Thailand.Mr. Campbell is the highest-ranking American official to hold substantive talks in Myanmar, formerly Burma, in more than a decade, and he described his trip as an “exploratory mission.”After a two-hour meeting on Wednesday with the leader of the country’s beleaguered democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Mr. Campbell urged the government to allow her “more frequent interactions” with members of her party, the National League for Democracy, which won elections in 1990 that were ignored by the ruling generals.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been held under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years and is allowed only infrequent meetings with anyone outside her home. Mr. Campbell is the most senior American representative she has met since 1995.'"
"'09-11-05,'0','In 2005, Michael S. Dell’s namesake company was getting pounded. His competitors were selling personal computers and servers built on cheap, popular and powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices, while Mr. Dell had stuck loyally with slower chips from Intel.In an e-mail note to Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, Mr. Dell threatened to switch to A.M.D. “I am tired of losing business,” Mr. Dell wrote. “We are losing the hearts, minds and wallets of our best customers.”Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $1 billion in the last year. “This was judged by your team to be more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues,” he wrote. Dell delayed buying A.M.D. chips, and Mr. Otellini said in a later e-mail message to a colleague that Dell was “the best friend money can buy.”Such payments to PC makers, along with other aggressive business tactics, are at the heart of the antirust lawsuit filed against Intel on Wednesday by New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo’s case  the first antitrust charges against the company in the United States in more than a decade  follows similar actions by regulators in Europe and Asia.According to Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, has for years used large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to talk Dell and other manufacturers into sticking with its products rather than increasing their business with A.M.D., a much smaller chip maker.As the supplier of about 80 percent of the central chips that power PCs and servers, Intel had monopoly power, which it abused, according to Mr. Cuomo. “Intel has used illegal threats, coercion, fines and bullying to preserve its stranglehold on the market,” he said at a news conference Wednesday. “We intend to stop them.”An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said the company had done nothing wrong. “Neither consumers, who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation, nor justice are being served by the decision to file a case now,” he said.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is no stranger to antitrust controversy. The company has spent the last five years defending itself against antitrust allegations, first in Asia and then in Europe.In May, the European Commission hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine for antitrust violations, which the company is appealing. Intel also faces a four-year-old antitrust lawsuit filed by A.M.D. in Federal District Court in Delaware and a continuing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.Although Intel has faced various antitrust claims for two decades, the cases against it have picked up steam in recent years because of developments in the chip industry.In 2003, A.M.D., Intel’s longtime nemesis, began selling a new line of chips widely regarded as superior in design and performance to Intel’s products. The chips were good enough to lift A.M.D. from the PC market into the higher-profit server computer market for the first time and begin selling to Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems.It took Intel about four years to come up with chips that matched or surpassed A.M.D.’s products in performance.While A.M.D. did well both in sales and market share gains during that period, the company’s top executives have long argued that it could have sold far more products had Intel not used strong-arm tactics to blunt its advantage.The lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Cuomo in the Delaware court, stretches beyond the interests of A.M.D., which is building a $4.2 billion plant in Saratoga County in upstate New York through a spinoff company, GlobalFoundries. Mr. Cuomo argues that Intel’s behavior curtailed innovation in the industry and forced consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for computers.Under federal antitrust law, states have the power to bring charges independently of the federal government. The F.T.C. and other states may file similar cases, much as in the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft a decade ago.The major complaints surrounding Intel concern its use of rebates and marketing dollars to keep customers. The New York suit argues that Intel executives threatened to take away such incentives from customers if they did more business with A.M.D.In addition, the lawsuit contends that if businesses were close to buying A.M.D.-based computers from a company like H.P. or Dell, Intel would jump in to help the computer makers sell Intel-based machines at a large discount.Over all, the hardware makers often became dependent on Intel’s incentives to keep their computer businesses profitable, making them reluctant to make a meaningful shift to A.M.D., the lawsuit said.Communications cited in the lawsuit show that Dell executives turned to Intel for payments to help them meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly financial results. When Dell finally decided to make products with A.M.D. chips, Intel reduced its chip rebates for the company by $600 million, according to the suit.The suit also contends that Intel paid I.B.M. to halt the production of a server based on A.M.D.’s chips.Rebate payments and other incentives provided to customers fall into a murky area of the law, according to antitrust scholars. Intel’s critics must show that it went beyond the typical actions that one would expect from a company trying to protect its business.“A lot of what they are talking about here sounds nefarious, but others would look at it and say that is how markets work,” said John E. Lopatka, a professor and antitrust expert at Pennsylvania State University’s Dickinson School of Law.Harry First, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said Delaware was an odd venue for Mr. Cuomo to pick for the lawsuit against Intel. “I assume they filed there because A.M.D.’s litigation against Intel is pending there,” he said.Piggybacking on A.M.D.’s lawsuit could make sense since most of the current cases against Intel share much of the same evidence. More than 200 million pages of documents have been exchanged between the parties in A.M.D.’s case against Intel.Antitrust experts following Mr. Cuomo’s actions said that both A.M.D. and I.B.M.  which is based in Armonk, N.Y., and competes against Intel in the server chip market  have invested billions of dollars in chip manufacturing plants in New York.Keith N. Hylton, a professor at the Boston University School of Law, said that Mr. Cuomo could benefit politically by taking such a prominent stand on behalf of local workers and consumers. “An attorney general is understood to be an aspiring governor,” he said. “They are politicians, and they want to be on the gravy train for big cases.”During the news conference, Mr. Cuomo said that thwarting Intel’s abusive actions was important to consumers and businesses worldwide. “It is not just about New York,” he said.'"
"'09-11-05,'0','Some advocates said they were unimpressed last month when President Obama signed a law against gay hate crimes but offered relatively restrained remarks. They questioned whether it was time to take a more confrontational posture toward Mr. Obama, who benefited during the 2008 campaign from a surge of votes and donations from gay men and lesbians.In Maine, advocates had stuck to a familiar path: using their own personal stories, they tried to persuade voters that gay people were no different from their straight neighbors and deserved equal treatment under the law.Now, many will argue that that approach is not enough. Some are already pressing for more aggressive tactics, like speeding up a ballot measure to reverse California’s ban on same-sex marriage next year, instead of taking more time to build support. Others want to focus on swaying federal lawmakers to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which Representative Barney Frank, the nation’s highest-ranking openly gay politician, has called foolish at this point.“The state-by-state strategy that looked clever a few years ago has run its course,” said Richard Socarides, who advised President Bill Clinton on gay issues. “The states that were easy to get have been gotten.”This year, Iowa, New Hampshire and Vermont joined Massachusetts and Connecticut in allowing same-sex marriage, but only through court rulings and legislative action.The tactic of using personal conversations to press for marriage equality will not be abandoned after Tuesday’s resounding vote, and several advocates said that, if anything, the defeat called for more such conversations around the country.Evan Wolfson, executive director of the national gay rights group Freedom to Marry, said the loss in Maine underscored “the fact that we need to continue those conversations and make ourselves visible as families in communities.”He added, “It shows we have just not done it long enough and deep enough, even in a place like Maine.”But opponents said that given Maine’s “live-and-let live” mentality, the results were especially strong proof that same-sex marriage was not gaining acceptance.“It interrupts the story line that is being manufactured that suggests the culture has shifted on gay marriage and the fight is over,” said Maggie Gallagher, president of the National Organization for Marriage, the conservative Christian group that is leading the charge against same-sex marriage around the country. “Maine is one of the most secular states in the nation. It’s socially liberal. They had a three-year head start to build their organization, and they outspent us two to one. If they can’t win there, it really does tell you the majority of Americans are not on board with this gay marriage thing.”Voter turnout was higher than expected in Maine — perhaps 50 percent, officials said — but not nearly as high as in last year’s presidential election, which drew record numbers of young people to the polls. Opponents of the repeal sought to mobilize college students, who tend to support same-sex marriage, but the outcome suggests they might not have succeeded.The next battlefields are New Jersey and New York, whose Democratic governors were pressing lawmakers to pass same-sex marriage bills by the end of the year, and California, where voters approved a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage last November. Gay rights groups there are likely to seek a ballot measure reversing the ban by 2012. A federal lawsuit challenging the prohibition is scheduled to go to trial in January and is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court.In New Jersey, Gov. Jon S. Corzine’s loss on Tuesday to Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who opposes same-sex marriage, dealt another potential blow to the movement. Mr. Christie has vowed to veto any same-sex marriage bill that reaches his desk, but Mr. Corzine could still sign a bill into law if the legislature approves it before January.The City Council in the District of Columbia also appears poised to pass a same-sex marriage law, although opponents are seeking a referendum that would ask voters to ban it.A more long-term, complex question is whether gay rights supporters can reverse the constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in some 30 states that have enacted them since 2000. The outcome in Maine reinforces voters’ reluctance to endorse same-sex marriage, which national polls echo, though the gap is narrowing. And supporters acknowledge they would much rather avoid ballot questions.“They tend to marginalize the group that is being targeted and inflame people’s passions in a way that is at best divisive and at worst terribly cruel,” said Jennifer C. Pizer, marriage project director for Lambda Legal, a national advocacy group. “Our founders did not intend to allow a majority to take basic rights from a minority.”Still, a group in Oregon announced Monday that it would seek a repeal of a constitutional ban there, perhaps as soon as 2012. Oregon voters approved the ban in 2004, and gay rights groups have been quietly building support for a repeal.But in general, supporters are more likely to focus on states with statutory bans on gay marriage, which legislatures can reverse without voter approval. One such state is Washington, where preliminary returns from Tuesday’s election showed voters approving an expansion of a domestic partnership law that would give gay couples more state-granted legal protections.Opponents of same-sex marriage said the outcome in Maine should make lawmakers in other states nervous about endorsing it.“We’re already hearing in both New York and New Jersey that they are noticing what’s happening here,” Ms. Gallagher said. “Do other politicians really want to enter this particular culture war given all the stuff they are going to have to defend in the next election?”'"
"'09-11-05,'0','The Dow Jones industrial average erased almost all of a 156-point rally after the House of Representatives passed a bill to curb rate increases on credit cards, touching off concern about bank earnings. The news outweighed investor optimism after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates at a record low.“Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after meeting in Washington. “Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.”Gold surged, settling at $1,092.20 an ounce, after the Fed announcement. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six currencies.This year, gold has soared 24 percent, heading for a ninth annual gain, as the dollar fell 6.8 percent. Gold has climbed on speculation that central banks and investors will buy more metal to hedge against a falling dollar. India’s central bank said this week that it bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund last month.“With interest rates so low, money is seeking markets that have an upside,” said Leonard Kaplan, the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill. “Momentum is crucial, and gold has a lot of momentum.”'"
"'09-11-05,'0','“The world continues to bear witness to their powerful calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights,” the statement said of the Iranian people. “It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past, or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity, and justice for its people.”Protesters openly flouted the day’s official anti-American message, with about 1,000 people gathering outside the Russian Embassy in Tehran and chanting, “The real den of spies is the Russian Embassy.”The American Embassy has been called the “den of spies” in Iran for decades. But many opposition supporters were angered by Russia’s early acceptance of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s disputed victory in Iran’s presidential election in June.On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, gave an angry speech accusing the United States of dictating the terms of the nuclear deal, and suggested that Mr. Obama was no different from his predecessor.There were reports of several dozen arrests in Wednesday’s protests, including some outside Tehran, and many injuries. The reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi, who has become the government’s most outspoken critic, narrowly avoided injury when pro-government forces fired a tear gas cylinder at him as he marched with protesters in Tehran, according to Radio Farda, an American-backed station. Two of his guards leapt to defend him and were hospitalized for their wounds, the station reported.Mir Hussein Moussavi, who was Mr. Ahmadinejad’s main challenger in the election, was prevented by security officers from attending the protests, Radio Farda reported.Over all, the police appeared to have fought back protesters more aggressively than they did in September, when opposition supporters in much larger numbers virtually hijacked a state-sponsored rally known as Jerusalem Day.The protest turnout on Wednesday may also have been limited by the fact that it took place on a workday, unlike the Jerusalem Day protest. Still, starting early in the morning, the streets of central Tehran were lined with police officers and Basij militia members, witnesses said. In the subways, officers singled out people wearing green armbands, bracelets or head scarves and ripped them off.One young man who had been leading antigovernment chants in Valiasr Square summed up the day’s events: “One day we come out and it’s our day, another day they suppress us. Today, we did not get to have our say, but it was good enough that we brought them out onto the streets.”Still, the day was a tonic to the opposition, which has struggled to maintain its momentum since the June election set off the country’s worst domestic unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The authorities have brutally suppressed the movement in recent months through a combination of arrests, show trials and intimidation. Many leading reformist figures remain in jail, and while some detainees have been released, the government arrests more critics every week.The protests in Tehran began in Haft-e-Tir Square. Many demonstrators wore surgical masks in anticipation of tear gas. As their numbers grew, police officers and Basij militia members fired tear gas and lunged periodically into the crowd to beat or arrest protesters.A disorderly march began, moving westward toward Valiasr Square, the scene of many earlier protests. The government’s official rally was taking place on a parallel route to the south, and a deployment of police officers and militia men prevented protesters from reaching it. By mid-afternoon, both demonstrations appeared to be ending.Many protesters seemed acutely conscious of the government’s vulnerability, after a week during which Mr. Ahmadinejad often seemed to be alone in his support for concluding a nuclear deal with the West.“They should get rid of all this ‘death to, death to’ — death to what?” said a middle-aged woman marching with her two daughters. “On the one hand they shout ‘Death to America’ and on the other hand they go and make deals with them.”The anniversary of the embassy takeover underscored a broader unease about relations with the West. The day has long been a touchstone for Iran’s revolutionaries, but Mr. Obama’s outreach has complicated the state’s reflexive anti-Americanism. One of Iran’s leading reformist voices, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, surprised many of his compatriots by declaring on Tuesday that the seizure of the embassy in 1979 was “not the right thing to do.”Mr. Ahmadinejad himself has argued that Iran has tamed the West’s arrogance and should now agree to the proposed nuclear deal, under which Iran’s uranium would be shipped abroad for processing and eventually returned in the form of fuel rods for a reactor to make medical isotopes.But his political enemies, both conservative and reformist, have seized on an opportunity to humiliate him, and have assailed the nuclear plan as a surrender to the West — a strategy he used against them in years past.'"

"'09-11-06,'1','A cool hobby and a hot blonde guide an aimless young man to his bliss in “Splinterheads,” a shaggy comedy with more heart than heft.It’s summer in a nameless, featureless small town, and Justin (Thomas Middleditch) is bored. Unenthusiastic about the lawn care business he shares with his best friend, Wayne (Jason Rogel), he’s more titillated than angry when the exotically named and tattooed Galaxy (Rachael Taylor) rips him off at the gas station. Galaxy’s grifter credentials are authenticated when Justin learns she’s a splinterhead: a carnival-based con artist who works marks on the midway. She is also an aficionado of geocaching, a satellite-guided treasure hunt and a too-obvious metaphor for Justin’s halfhearted search for a life.Written and directed by Brant Sersen, who conjures his offbeat milieu without breaking a sweat, “Splinterheads” gains traction from an eclectic cast that knows how to work a line. Lea Thompson (little altered since her 1983 turn as Tom Cruise’s high school honey in “All the Right Moves”) settles comfortably into her role as Justin’s overprotective mom, while the estimable Christopher McDonald plays her simmering ex-boyfriend with practiced restraint. And thanks to Michael Simmonds’s clean, color-rich photography, the film has a visual polish rarely seen in low-budget projects: the gags may not always work, but the skin tones are perfect.Directed by Brant Sersen; written by Mr. Sersen, based on a story by Mr. Sersen and Brendan McFeat Burke; director of photography, Michael Simmonds; edited by Chris Lechler; music by John Swihart; production designer, Chad Keith; produced by Darren Goldberg, Christopher Marsh and Anisa Qureshi; released by Paladin and Atlantic Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','In “The Men Who Stare at Goats” George Clooney wears a heavy mustache and a somewhat shaggier version of the military haircut called a high and tight, two adjectives which also describe his performance in this likable, lightweight, absurdist comedy.As Lyn Cassady — a fictional member of an Army unit that was weirder and possibly truer than most science fiction — Mr. Clooney has shed his cool cat skin to embrace his inner clown. Juggling tics, double takes, eyeball bulges and explosive gestures, he leaps in the air and splats in the sand with cartoon abandon, buoyed by the jokes and the big bounce of his own stardom.With his thrusting jaw, Lyn looks as if he could have been drawn by Milton Caniff, the creator of the comic-strip tough guy Steve Canyon. Instead Lyn has been drawn in crude if generally effective strokes by Mr. Clooney and his producing partner, Grant Heslov, who together also wrote “Good Night, and Good Luck.” Mr. Clooney directed that film, but for this one Mr. Heslov has moved behind the camera to make a somewhat ragged directing debut. Though he never settles into a groove, moving between would-be parody and could-be sincerity, Mr. Heslov does keep the parts more or less in play, aided by the outlandishness of his story and by the performances of Mr. Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang.Written by Peter Straughan and based on the nonfiction book by Jon Ronson, also titled “The Men Who Stare at Goats,” the film tells parallel stories that finally join. One involves a journalist, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who after his marriage tanks, heads to Iraq to give his life meaning. What he discovers is Lyn, a recruit in the mysterious New Earth Army, an experimental Army program centered on parapsychology that was developed by a Vietnam vet, Bill Django (Mr. Bridges) and pushed into creation by the gonzo General Hopgood (Mr. Lang). Realizing that he has the makings of a juicy story, Bob tags after Lyn, a decision that leads him both into Iraq and Lyn’s past in the New Earth Army.Bill’s initiative, born in the fields of Vietnam and baptized in the hot tubs of the New Age movement, brings together Buddhism, pantheism, militarism and old-fashioned hooey-ism, the idea being that war can be waged with love, eagle feathers and assorted paranormal techniques — with a few martial arts moves thrown in. General Hopgood and Lyn take to the program with a seriousness bordering on devotional, partly because Bill, or rather the irresistible Mr. Bridges, could inspire lemmings of any genus. His batty smile and loosey-goosey gestural performance, which brings to mind a modern dance teacher stoned on good vibes, perfectly complements Mr. Lang’s spring-loaded turn. (Mr. Lang is having a very nice year, with roles also in Michael Mann’s “Public Enemies” and James Cameron’s “Avatar.”)'"
"'09-11-06,'1','WASHINGTON — One of the federal government’s most opaque methods for bailing out the banking system allowed a handful of giant institutions to save up to $25 billion on their borrowing costs, a Congressional panel estimated on Friday.Seven companies received about 82 percent of those benefits, the panel estimated. General Electric Capital was able to reduce its borrowing costs by about $1.9 billion, while Goldman Sachs saved an estimated $606 million. The other big beneficiaries were Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Company.The savings came in the form of federal guarantees on more than $300 billion of bonds issued by banks and other financial institutions, and they were merely one component of a $4.3 trillion safety net of guarantees orchestrated last year by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.In one of the first systematic efforts to analyze the maze of guarantees and hidden subsidies, the Congressional panel that oversees the Treasury’s $700 billion rescue program said the guarantees had provided a cheap but risky tactic for fighting the financial crisis last year.The good news for taxpayers, the panel said, is that the government has actually turned a profit thus far on the guarantees. The government has collected $9 billion in fees for guaranteeing bonds issued by the big financial institutions and a total of $17 billion in fees for all its emergency guarantees. Thus far, it has lost only about $2 million.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','One good way to think about modern agriculture is to think about apples. For part of our history, culminating around the end of the 19th century, there was something about us — about our appetite, our farms, our economy — that loved diversity in apples. One standard reference, from 1905, lists more than 6,500 distinct varieties. There are apples for keeping, cooking, eating and the making of ciders, with names as colorful as they are various: Scollop Gillyflower, Red Winter Pearmain, Kansas Keeper.Modern agriculture, as well as our carefully created preference for processed over fresh food, has pushed us in the opposite direction, toward uniformity. Apple production has been outsourced, driven to China like so much else. And even in formerly great apple-growing states, including New York, the number of different apples has greatly diminished. According to one estimate, only 11 varieties make up 90 percent of all the apples sold in this country, and Red Delicious alone counts for nearly half of that.The good news is that apple trees don’t vanish when the harvest is over. Nor are they solely commercial. Every farmer, every homesteader in an apple climate, seems to have planted an apple tree. Many have been lost, but some still stand — old, overgrown trees producing long-forgotten varieties.Researchers from the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation have been studying genetic markers in 280 venerable apple trees growing on old farmsteads in the Southwest. Some came from commercial nurseries, others from agriculture experiment stations, but most were unique.Those trees are an archive of apple diversity, holding out the possibility of preserving apple genotypes that might otherwise have vanished. But the research makes a broader point. If all that 19th-century apple diversity reflected different purposes and different needs, it also reflected a taste for difference. So the next apple you buy, think about all its hundreds and thousands of abandoned cousins. Think also of the agricultural biodiversity they represented; think, too, of the diversity of tastes that made them possible.We live now in the world of the generic apple, in large part because our taste buds have gone generic. Cultivating ourselves is the first step toward rediversifying the fields and orchards around us.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','The unlikely darling of both Tyler Perry and Oscar watchers, “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” the story of an impoverished, overweight, illiterate teenager twice impregnated by her father, is part bootstrap drama and part lurid potboiler, A.O. Scott writes: “ ‘Precious’ is a hybrid, a mash-up that might have been ungainly but that manages to be graceful instead.” A lot of credit goes to its first-time star, Gabourey Sidibe, who unreservedly embodies the role. “ ‘Precious’ is unabashedly populist in its potent emotional appeal,” Mr. Scott writes, “and at the same time determined to challenge its audience’s complacency as only a genuine work of art can.”'"
"'09-11-06,'1','The only loss that could arouse a tinge of regret was Game 4, when Brad Lidge allowed three runs after being one strike from escorting the Phillies into the bottom of the ninth inning with the score tied and the top of the order due up against the left-hander Phil Coke. As hushed as their clubhouse was after that defeat, the Phillies after Wednesday’s game took a cue from their manager, Charlie Manuel, and talked about how proud they were to have overcome injuries — J. C. Romero, Brett Myers, Jamie Moyer — and expectations even to reach the World Series again.The last defending champion to do so was the 2001 Yankees, and the Phillies should have a similar look in 2010, which should set them up for a third straight run. Rollins often speaks of a potential dynasty, and in his mind it is still possible.“You usually have to win two in a row,” he said. Then, alluding to the perennially contending Spurs of the N.B.A, he added, “But San Antonio’s pretty good winning every other year.”Many of the Phillies’ best players, including Howard, Chase Utley and Raul Ibanez, have long-term contracts, and the team maintains contractual control over every member of its fearsome lineup and five starting pitchers. The Phillies hold a $9 million option on Lee that they will undoubtedly exercise and a $5 million option on third baseman Pedro Feliz, who may not return if they choose to acquire an offensive upgrade, like the free agent Adrian Beltre, without undermining their infield defense. Their primary free agents are Myers, Pedro Martinez, Chan Ho Park, Scott Eyre and Matt Stairs.“Basically, you’ve got the same guys coming back, and I feel good with the core group of guys that are going to be back,” Lee said. “We’re going to be a good team again next year, and I fully expect to get back here.”Philadelphia’s off-season agenda will focus as much on improving from the outside — strengthening the bench, improving a bullpen that had a 5.40 earned run average in the series — as on internal plans to straighten out Cole Hamels and Lidge, two pivotal pieces from their 2008 title run. After an uneven regular season, a poor postseason has heaped even more pressure on Hamels, who has vowed to arrive at spring training in better shape. His revival would give the Phillies a No. 2 starter — or 1A — behind Lee and make them even more formidable.The Phillies were spoiled by Lidge’s dominance in 2008, but his disappointing season will force them to examine whether his struggles were health-related, as he suggested, or caused by something else. Lidge said he was looking forward to hibernating at home in Colorado, letting his body and, most of all, his mind recover. With Ryan Madson under contract through 2011, the Phillies have a fallback option if Lidge sputters early next season, but they will most likely seek to add a reliever with closing experience.“I know we can do better because as I sit here tonight, I know Hamels is going to be better and I know Lidge is going to be better,” Manuel said. “I can tell you guys that. I know that.”Manuel may not be clear on his history — he misquoted Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s “I shall return” by saying, “We will be back” — but he has a keen sense for the dramatic.After bemoaning the Phillies’ hitting woes with runners in scoring position — 4 for 28 in their four losses — Manuel was asked whether he believed the Yankees were a better team.“They got the trophy, we don’t,” he said. “We gave it up, but we’re going to get it back.”'"
"'09-11-06,'1','New York City health officials have distributed small amounts of the swine flu vaccine to some major New York companies, including Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, even as shortages continue.Citigroup has received 1,200 doses, more than half of what it requested, health officials said, and in late October, Goldman received 200 of the 5,400 doses it asked for. By contrast, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center received 200 of the 27,400 doses that it requested for its patients, workers and volunteers, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.Jessica Scaperotti, a health department spokeswoman, said the priority was to get the vaccine to pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists, community health centers and public and private hospitals. Private companies that have asked for the vaccine are also eligible to receive it, as long as it is distributed to people who are considered at risk. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs said they had administered the vaccine to pregnant women and employees with serious health conditions. News reports on Thursday that the two banks and other companies received doses of the vaccine led Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a former New York City health commissioner, to send out a letter reminding officials nationwide to make sure the vaccine goes only to people in high priority groups. Any decisions “that appear to direct the vaccine to people outside the identified priority groups have the potential to undermine the credibility of the program,” he said.Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the focus on the banks was a distraction. “They’re not going to be giving it to the top bankers,” he said. “There’s no reason a high-risk person should get it at a public clinic instead of at work.”A spokeswoman for Goldman said the bank, “like other responsible employers, has requested vaccine and will supply it only to employees who qualify.”'"
"'09-11-06,'1','She has expanded the art of drawing with works that swing dramatically between intimate and monumental. Her method involves splicing two or more smaller sheets with nearly identical images into a single very large one — a process that cannily combines carving, cartography and quilting. In breathtaking photographs she has documented the terrain, shoreline and geothermal wonders of Iceland, whose strange, isolated beauty is one of the mainstays of her art.Ms. Horn has also contributed to Conceptual Art’s influential fusion of text and image, and thus the experiences of reading and looking. At the Whitney, “Still Water (The River Thames, for Example),” consists of 15 large, mesmerizing close-ups of the river’s surface with tiny white numbers scattered on the waves. These refer to footnotes at the bottom of each image. The experience of reading Ms. Horn’s meandering thoughts on water, photography, color and so on enables you to better hear your own.If Ms. Horn has been given too much acreage in the galleries, she dominates the catalog. The first volume contains a short essay by Briony Fer, a British art historian, that sheds little light on Ms. Horn’s life or early development. An article in this month’s W magazine points, for example, to her precociousness. Born in 1955, she quit high school a year early at 16 and enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design. She earned an undergraduate degree in three years, visited Iceland for the first time and a year later went on to graduate work in sculpture at Yale.Even more symptomatic is the second volume of the catalog, titled “Subject Index,” an illustrated glossary of words, place names and occasionally people assembled by Ms. Horn and pertinent to her work. Most of the entries come from her published writing, unpublished notes, interviews, letters and statements. In them she sounds smart, humorless and prone to stating the obvious as if it were a revelation. But these passages can be engagingly autobiographical.The remaining entries are contributed by nearly two dozen curators, critics and other writers and a handful of artists. We hear from the curators of the show, Mark Godfrey of the Tate Modern, where it was seen last winter, and its overseers at the Whitney, Donna De Salvo, chief curator and associate director for programs, and Carter E. Foster, curator of drawings. We also hear from the theorists Hélène Cixous and Thierry de Duve and the poet Anne Carson. But Ms. Horn’s writing voice rises above the others. It is one of the most memorable aspects of the show. The downside of this is that no one makes a concise case for her art: for its debts to previous artists, for its originality and for its place among the work of her contemporaries. Things like this need to be sorted out.In the catalog and the brochure there are several references to the art of Donald Judd, who was a friend of Ms. Horn’s and bought her work, but no one gets too specific. For example, “Pink Tons” is foggily translucent on its sides but suddenly transparent on its top; you look down into big folds of seemingly still-liquid glass. This experience echoes a well-known Judd floor piece that has four copper sides, and inside a bottom of bright red.These works are similarly startling and seductive, but Judd’s piece is mostly empty volume; it doesn’t use much material relative to its size. The Horn, on the other hand, is solid, voluptuous, extravagant matter. You could decide that it has intimations of softness and femininity, or you could think that the sheer presence and sensuous power of the glass overwhelms the artist’s use of it.Ms. Horn has a tendency to appropriate big ideas for her work: Emily Dickinson, Iceland, water, androgyny. The problem is that she doesn’t actually do much with them. In a way her most complex creation is her own persona, as suggested by a recent work titled “a k a.” Lining the walls of a gallery at the Whitney, it consists of 15 pairs of photographs of Ms. Horn. Usually a snapshot of the artist as a beguiling youngster is paired with an image of her in or on the brink of her maturity. Often the angle of the pose and the facial expression seem to match. As you watch her grow up, and her sense of identity and sexuality mutate, the work becomes a poignant reminder of how much change a lifetime can bring, and yet how much the child remains parent to the artist.There is more going on in this one gallery than anywhere else in the show, although a small gallery devoted to drawings, photographs and books of and about Iceland is a close second. Among the paired images, one in particular stands out. Taken in 1975 on her first trip to Iceland, it shows Ms. Horn sitting partly obscured in a moss-covered lava field that spreads around her like a bumpy, green, phantasmagoric stage set. Her narrow face is almost enveloped by long red hair whose bulk resembles a small thatched roof. Beneath it Ms. Horn looks out at us, slightly druidic, a trifle reptilian, blinking in the sunlight.In the W article, she said of this picture, “It’s weird how much I look like Iceland.” The work is reproduced by itself in the catalog, where it is titled “Destiny.”Given that “a k a” dates from 2008-9, it may be that Ms. Horn had decided to put herself overtly at the center of her art. The self-revelation of “a k a” continues in the W article. It includes a photograph showing Ms. Horn seated on the terrace of her New York apartment pouring herself a glass of wine. She wears her signature pants and sports jacket, open, without a shirt, her bare breasts casually visible. Her pose tweaks the privileges of male artists without looking like an act.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','Choosing one’s next movie project after winning Academy Awards for best director and best film doesn’t always come quickly — just ask James Cameron — but Danny Boyle, whose film “Slumdog Millionaire” won eight Oscars in February, has figured out his follow-up. Variety reported that Mr. Boyle (whose films also include “Trainspotting” and “28 Days Later”) will next direct “127 Hours,” a biographical film about the mountaineer Aron Lee Ralston. Mr. Ralston made headlines in 2003 when an 800-pound boulder fell on his right hand and crushed it while he was exploring Robbers Roost in southeastern Utah. After being trapped for several days, he sawed off the lower part of the trapped arm and hiked to his rescue. The project is expected to reunite Mr. Boyle with two “Slumdog Millionaire” colleagues: the screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and the producer Christian Colson. Production is to begin next year; no casting has yet been announced.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','Just below it is a design for a coffin lid drawn in 1920 by Lothar Schreyer, a director of the Bauhaus theater, for his wife (which, in a nice Freudian twist, was used for his mother’s burial instead). A woman’s figure, composed of interlocking circles and laid over a vibrant background of gray and blue, is framed by the lid’s trapezoidal outline. Farther along you come up against Marcel Breuer’s 1921 “African” chair, whose crudely chiseled wood frame looks so out of place with conventional images of the Bauhaus that you may wonder if you’ve walked into the wrong show.These works reveal an ambivalence about the machine age and what was being left behind. Even as Walter Gropius, the school’s founding director, was promoting a mass-production aesthetic, Itten and others were advocating a more atavistic approach, one that was rooted in the skills of the medieval craftsman. (Itten even began his classes on abstract art with a series of yoga exercises that were meant to reawaken the physical senses and bring the students in closer contact with their work.)Such conflicts, central to the experimental nature of the Bauhaus, were never fully resolved. In 1923 Gropius replaced Itten with the Hungarian painter Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, who brought with him the agenda of the Soviet Constructivists, whose pure abstract forms were meant to form the building blocks of a new world order.His paintings known as “EM1,” “EM2” and “EM3,” compositions of lines on a white surface that were produced in a factory by applying porcelain and enamel to sheets of steel, are among the most radical works in the show, and still have the power to startle 86 years after they were made. They fit perfectly with Gropius’s vision of the artist as someone who worked in partnership with the machine.In Gropius’s mind that system would soon be applied to the entire range of industrial products, from architecture to graphics, textiles, lighting and furniture design. The alliance between designers and leaders of modern industry would spread his message around the world.Yet even in Moholy-Nagy’s work the message is more mixed than it at first seems. The steel paintings, inverted crosses in primary colors, evoke their own brand of spiritualism. In a more conventional oil painting he made the same year, hanging on a nearby wall, the overlapping lines and planes bring to mind the quasi-religious subtext found in some of Konstantin Malevich’s works. Is it an architectural plan? A child’s rendition of a plane in flight? Or a fallen cross?The most heart-warming objects in the show are often those where you feel the presence of the artist’s hand. These include a series of puppets that Paul Klee, who taught a color and form class, made for his son from 1916 to 1925. The puppets, which include a scary clown with protruding ears and a figure of Klee himself in a black robe, look as though they were crudely patched together out of papier-mâché and leftover pieces of wool while Klee was sitting at a kitchen table.Harder for the show to convey is the mischievous spirit that was such a fundamental part of the Bauhaus experience. There is a very funny photo of a performance workshop, with students dressed up in expressionless masks and padded costumes — human machines. Another image, a blown-up version of which adorns the exhibition’s entry, shows students packed inside a towering grid of wooden crates: a reference to the Gropius-designed dormitories that was ceremoniously handed to the director on the eve of his departure from the school.But the show doesn’t capture the general tumult: the crazy costumes, the political rallies, the spontaneous parties that often spilled out onto the streets and scandalized its buttoned-up middle-class neighbors.It wasn’t until Hannes Meyer created the architecture department in 1927 that the school’s messy, playful energies, as well as the wild back and forth of ideas they gave rise to, began to be contained by academic categories. Like Gropius, Meyer, who shortly became the school’s director, envisioned the Bauhaus’s studios as industrial workshops that would not only train modern artisans but also forge alliances with the commercial world. (A collection of textiles released in 1929 was the most profitable line in the school’s history.) But his architectural philosophy was more overtly political, stressing humble materials over sleek forms, and small clusters of human activity over the large geometric compositions favored by his predecessor.It is worth spending some time with his drawings for the ADGB building, for instance, a trade union school in Bernau. (They are the only technical drawings in the show.) In contrast to Gropius’s Bauhaus dormitory, with its taut glass shell, the ADGB is broken down into small, color-coded blocks. The sleek built-in furniture favored by Gropius and Breuer is replaced by inexpensive wood pieces, made to fold up and roll away in tight spaces.The Nazis despised Meyer’s leftist outlook, and in two years he was forced out by the region’s right-wing government. And one of the first things that Mies van der Rohe did when he took the school over was to force students to sign a declaration that they were not Communists. An aesthete to the core, he was convinced that creative issues were above politics — and anything that might advance his agenda was within bounds.Mies pushed architecture to the fore, and his enormous presence quickly began to crowd out other voices. In the last room of the exhibition there are a series of student drawings made during his tenure, glass-and-steel compositions that look uncannily like reproductions of Mies’s own work, as if the students were now there to worship at the master’s feet. Whatever mysticism was left was sublimated behind enormous sheets of reflective glass.Mies, of course, didn’t fare much better with the Nazis than Meyer had, and on April 11, 1933, the school’s doors closed forever. Its most prominent figures scattered to different countries, some to Moscow, others to the United States. Three-quarters of a century later its most famous objects — chairs, lamps, a chess set — can be found in the MoMA gift shop, harmless examples of what was once a radical vision.Yet for a moment at least the show allows you to glimpse just how wild that creative roller coaster really was. The school’s creative clashes were a reflection of how much their participants had at stake, both aesthetically and politically. All of them lived somewhere between the world as they saw it and the world as they wished it could be. Their yearning, never fulfilled, haunts you long after you leave the show.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','BANGKOK — The Thai government announced Thursday that it was recalling its ambassador to Cambodia to protest Cambodia’s appointment of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted as Thailand’s prime minister, to a high-profile position. The moves put new strains on already tense relations between the countries.Mr. Thaksin was removed in a coup in September 2006 and now helps lead the Thai opposition movement from abroad.The Thai Foreign Ministry said the appointment of Mr. Thaksin as economic adviser to Cambodia’s prime minister represented a “failure to respect Thailand’s judicial system.”“The Royal Thai Government cannot stand idly by and has to take into consideration the sentiment of its people,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Thai government appears particularly dismayed at the idea that Mr. Thaksin, who now spends much of his time in Dubai, might be able to galvanize his supporters from just across the border. Hun Sen, the Cambodian prime minister, has offered Mr. Thaksin a residence in Cambodia.Mr. Thaksin, who retains a loyal following here, is wanted in Thailand for a conviction in a politically charged case involving land that his wife purchased while he was prime minister.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','Following is a transcript of President Obama's remarks on Thursday in which he announced that the AARP and the American Medical Association have endorsed the current health care legislation in Congress, as released by the White House:THE PRESIDENT: Hey! Hello, everybody. Please sit down. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to come down and just talk a little bit about health care before Robert gives his regular briefing.I am extraordinarily pleased and grateful to learn that the AARP and the American Medical Association are both supporting the health insurance reform bill that will soon come up to a vote in the House of Representatives.When it comes to the AARP, this is no small endorsement. For more than 50 years, they have been a leader in the fight to reduce the cost of health care and expand coverage for our senior citizens. They are a non-partisan organization, and their board made their decision to endorse only after a careful, intensive, objective scrutiny of this bill. They're endorsing this bill because they know it will strengthen Medicare, not jeopardize it. They know it will protect the benefits our seniors receive, not cut them. So I want everybody to remember that the next time you hear the same tired arguments to the contrary from the insurance companies and their lobbyists. And remember this endorsement the next time you see a bunch of misleading ads on television.The AARP knows this bill will make health care more affordable. They know it will make coverage more secure. They know it's a good deal for our seniors. And that's why we're thrilled that they're standing up for this effort.The same is true for the doctors and medical professionals who are supporting this bill today. These are men and women who know our health care system best and have been watching this debate closely. They would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors. They would not be with us if they believed that reform would in any way damage the critical and sacred doctor-patient relationship.Instead, they're supporting reform because they've seen firsthand what's broken about our health care system. They've seen what happens when patients can't get the care they need because some insurance company has decided to drop their coverage or water it down. They've seen what happens when a patient is forced to pay out-of-pocket costs of thousands of dollars that she doesn't have to get the treatment she desperately needs. They've seen what happens when patients don't come in for regular check-ups or screenings because either their insurance company doesn't cover them or they can't afford health insurance in the first place. And they've seen far, far too much of their time spent filling out forms and haggling with insurance company bureaucrats.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','After weeks of speculation on Wall Street, prosecutors brought a fresh round of insider trading charges on Thursday that left no doubt they were aiming at hedge funds and the networks of market gossip that are endemic on trading floors.The charges, against 14 money managers, lawyers and other investors, followed the arrest last month of a hedge fund billionaire, Raj Rajaratnam, on charges that he had profited from inside information.In the latest criminal complaints, prosecutors described a network that used prepaid cellphones to avoid detection, and that was pierced in part through surveillance and wiretaps.One law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said the authorities expected to make more arrests in the coming weeks. The investigation is part of a broad Federal Bureau of Investigation push into crimes related to hedge funds, including the addition of a third securities fraud unit in New York, the official said.And for the first time, the authorities hinted that they might be brushing against the pinnacle of the hedge fund world, S.A.C. Capital Management, a $12 billion Connecticut fund company. Neither S.A.C. nor any current employee has been charged with wrongdoing.The broadest of Thursday’s complaints names seven defendants, including Arthur J. Cutillo, a lawyer at the prestigious firm of Ropes & Gray, who is accused of offering tips on impending takeovers that the firm worked on. The tips were then passed among a group of lawyers and traders.Prosecutors also announced five guilty pleas from hedge fund managers in Massachusetts and California, including one from Roomy Khan, the witness at the center of the case against Mr. Rajaratnam.As part of a plea agreement made public on Thursday, prosecutors agreed not to charge Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a California fund manager who worked at S.A.C. from 1999 through January 2004, on any insider trading he committed at S.A.C. as long as he had disclosed the insider trading to them. Mr. Lee pleaded guilty in October to insider trading while running his own hedge fund last year.Jeffrey L. Bornstein, Mr. Lee’s lawyer and a partner at K&L Gates, said Mr. Lee was cooperating with the authorities and could not comment on the letter or what information Mr. Lee might be able to provide.A spokesman for S.A.C. said he could not comment on the letter.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the investigation, which began more than two years ago, was continuing. He added that investors who believed they were at risk of being charged should come forward voluntarily.“I urge you to come knocking on our door before we come knocking on yours,” Mr. Bharara said.In all, 20 defendants have now been charged in the overlapping cases, and five have pleaded guilty.Defense lawyers who were not involved in the case said the government’s tactics, which included phone taps and wiring cooperating witnesses, were more typically used in organized crime than in securities fraud cases.Still, the investigation has not publicly ensnared any of the biggest hedge funds. And the total profits that the schemes are said to have produced are relatively modest, about $60 million so far.Mr. Rajaratnam is not named in any of the complaints or pleas announced on Thursday. But Galleon, his company, appears to be at the center of the investigation. The two men identified as leaders of the ring, Zvi Goffer and Craig Drimal, are former employees of Galleon.Mr. Goffer worked at Galleon from January to August 2008, while Mr. Drimal had an office at Galleon, according to the complaint. A person knowledgeable about Galleon said that Mr. Goffer had been laid off last year as part of a broader staff reduction, while Mr. Drimal was once an employee.Thursday’s complaint does not claim that the men used insider information on Galleon’s behalf. Instead, it claims that they traded for their own accounts, making millions of dollars buying stocks in companies that were about to be taken over. Mr. Drimal made the largest profits, earning $8 million, according to the complaint.The defendants were concerned about the possibility of wiretaps and informants and frequently talked about ways to avoid being caught, according to the complaint. It said that in February 2008, Mr. Goffer warned Jason C. Goldfarb, another defendant, against making trades that were too obvious.'"
"'09-11-06,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Productivity surged in the third quarter at the fastest pace in six years while labor costs continued to drop, a combination that is likely to bolster companies’ profits but continue to saddle workers with stagnant incomes.The productivity news came as a second report said that the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in 10 months.In the first report, the Labor Department says productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, was rising at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter, much better than the 6.4 percent gain economists had expected. Unit labor costs fell at a 5.2 percent rate.It is typical for productivity to soar in the early stages of a recovery as businesses continue to aggressively cut costs even as output rebounds. However, the concern is that the continued squeeze on workers’ incomes will depress consumer spending in the months ahead, putting the economic recovery at risk.The number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits falls to the lowest level in 10 months, evidence that job cuts are easing as the economy slowly heals.'"
"'09-11-07,'0','The House passed legislation that would give the government the authority to force companies to replace chemicals that terrorists could use in attacks with safer alternatives. The measure, approved 230 to 193, was opposed by the DuPont Company and others in the chemical industry. The legislation would make permanent the authority to oversee chemical plant security that was temporarily given to the homeland security secretary in 2006. Chemical-industry lobbyists say that letting the secretary mandate substitutions in chemicals and manufacturing processes, as the House measure would do, could cause shortages of some products. The Senate has its own version of the legislation, which it is not expected to take up until next year.'"
"'09-11-07,'0','Jessica Pell was grateful that Mr. Sebastian omitted from the portrait of Briscoe, her bearded, shaggy Brussels griffon, the oddness that others sometimes see in him. “Some people look at Briscoe and think he looks like an Ewok,” she said, holding up a dog that looked a lot like an Ewok, the short, furry creature of Star Wars lore. “He captured a regal quality in him. He captures things that you, as an owner, feel no one else would see.”The drawing is one of Ms. Pell’s prized possessions, because of what it says about her dog, but also about Mr. Sebastian. “The fact that someone would care enough that he’d want to draw what’s unique about your dog for you,” she explained, trailing off.Even more than the free art, it is his knack for noticing, for caring about the small details of his fellow dog lovers’ days, that Ms. Pell knows will leave her bereft when Mr. Sebastian and his wife move back to their native Ohio the day after Thanksgiving. They decided to make the move so that Mr. Sebastian, who has Parkinson’s disease, can get easy access to care at a retirement home.Ms. Pell, who is single and works for herself, said that right now, Mr. Sebastian represents stability to her. She’s there every day; he’s there every day, often with Susie, always with Kitty, a border terrier, attending to the story line of Ms. Pell’s life, picking up on the details that other good friends, absorbed in their own narratives, often miss. “Susie and Dick never forget,” she said. “They’ll ask you the next day, ‘Are you feeling better?’ Or, ‘How did the meeting go?’ ”New York is full of ad-hoc communities based on proximity and built up around mutual affection — walk into any watering hole at 7:30 p.m. — but they often have a live-and-let-live looseness to them. While parental oversight can stifle, in loco parentis oversight can be a rare, welcome comfort in the circles of urban life.For passionate dog people, the folks at the Washington Square Park dog run are also, it turns out, passionate people people, and there have been myriad parties scheduled in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Sebastian before they depart.Leaving is painful, said Mr. Sebastian, but walking down subway stairs is increasingly difficult. The joys of living in New York — the museums, the restaurants, the various parks — were eluding him, leaving him with only a very high rent to pay.

"'09-11-07,'0','To take Synergenz’s Respiragene test, consumers swab the inside of a cheek to get DNA and send the sample to a laboratory in Kentucky. The Synergenz Web site says a physician is required to sign a form requesting the test. The Respiragene test looks at 20 spots in a person’s genome where DNA varies among people. It uses that data, as well as nongenetic information like the person’s smoking history, to compute a risk score.About 50 percent of smokers will end up in the group that is deemed to have the average risk of lung cancer for smokers, said Dr. Robert Young, Synergenz’s chief scientific officer.Thirty percent will be in the high-risk group, with about four times the average risk for smokers. And 20 percent would be in the very-high-risk group — those with about 10 times the risk of an average smoker.The average smoker has a lifetime risk of lung cancer of about 10 percent, which is about 20 times as high as that of a nonsmoker. This would imply that smokers found to be at highest risk from the genetic test would have a near certainty of getting cancer.To develop the test, Dr. Young and colleagues looked at DNA samples from 239 smokers with lung cancer and 200 without to find genetic variations — known as single nucleotide polymorphisms — that correlated with having the disease. They further narrowed the list of variations by looking at DNA samples from an additional 491 smokers. The results were published in the journal PLoS One in April.To validate the test, researchers followed a group of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for four years. Those who developed lung cancer were more likely to have been given high risk scores by the test.'"
"'09-11-07,'0','In retrospect, Mr. Turan thinks it was all bad timing. Papp’s prostate cancer, which would kill him three years later, in 1991, had just been diagnosed, and he had discovered that his son Tony had AIDS. Mr. Turan said that there were a lot of details about Papp’s varied and tumultuous relationships, but that in the end, no one item could be blamed.“He just wasn’t in the frame of mind to work on it,” he said.Papp’s widow, Gail Merrifield Papp, agreed. She said that given everything that was happening, her husband just “didn’t have the presence of mind to deal with a collaboration on a first draft.”As for particular objections, Ms. Papp said, “I think the issue that Joe had was journalistic balance among the voices in the book,” concern with the need for a “rounded picture.”For years the manuscript lay in a box in Mr. Turan’s garage. Then, about 10 years ago, he finally got up the gumption to send Ms. Papp a letter about revisiting the oral history. “I wrote that this was too good to die,” he said.The two eventually met and discussed what kind of book they wanted, and Ms. Papp gave the go-ahead. This week Doubleday finally released the streamlined and polished oral history, which lists both Mr. Turan and Papp as authors.One of Ms. Papp’s favorite stories in the book is about her husband’s running into Wallace Shawn, then a struggling playwright, on a street corner in 1975. As Papp told the story, he asked what Mr. Shawn was doing for a living. Working in the garment district as a shipping clerk, he replied.“How much are you making a week?” Papp asked.Papp told him: “Quit your job.” He would pay him the same amount to write.“ ‘Quit your job’ ” Papp said. ‘Quit — your — job!’ ”Ms. Papp said: “I love that. That was very representative of how Joe operated. He was very impulsive, but smart. It was not an institutional move, but a very personal and creative move.”Papp was devoted to actors and playwrights. Martin Sheen recounts that after Papp tapped him to play Hamlet, other cast members laughed at him because he had never been to college or read the play.“I didn’t know how to pronounce words, honest to God,” he said. “I’d have to stop in the middle of something and say, ‘What’s a bodkin?’ ”Papp told him: “Dare to fail, because you’ll never succeed on any level if you’re not willing to fail to the worst degree. So make an ass of yourself.”Volcanic and emotional, Papp often ended up breaking off from colleagues he had worked with for a long time. Some of these events are told “Rashomon”-style, with overlapping memories.Other voices include those of the actors George C. Scott, Colleen Dewhurst, Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd and James Earl Jones; the playwrights David Rabe and David Hare; the directors Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols; the composer Marvin Hamlisch; the former mayors Robert F. Wagner and John V. Lindsay; and dozens of people behind the scenes.Mr. Turan said opinions were divided as to whether the Public would have been created without Papp. Certainly other collaborators, like the director Stuart Vaughan and Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater since 1985, were deeply involved in every step of the process. But as Mr. Turan notes, Papp was a zealot about free Shakespeare. “I was consumed by the idea” of starting a theater, Papp says at one point.Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public since 2004, met Papp once, when he auditioned for a role in the 1976 production of “Henry V.” He didn’t get it.“What really struck me was the tempestuousness that went into all the great achievements of the Public,” said Mr. Eustis, who described himself as even-tempered and controlled. Since the interviews were conducted before Papp’s death and the mythologizing began, there is “a rawness,” he said, adding:“This doesn’t sound cleaned up. It’s a very complex portrait that feels incredibly vibrant and fresh.”Are there lessons for him in this creation story?The mission of the Public hasn’t changed, Mr. Eustis said, but the institution has matured. “It requires someone of Joe’s temperament to carve it out,” he said, “and perhaps someone of my temperament to keep it going.”'"

"'09-11-07,'0','Local health departments decide who gets each vaccine lot, and the centers sent a letter to all state, county and city health officers on Thursday reminding them to make sure it was going only to people at risk.The agency itself had “no evidence that providers were giving vaccine outside the recommended priority populations,” Dr. Schuchat said.Independent flu experts noted that workplace clinics could control who got vaccine, while public vaccination campaigns have been plagued by reports of people begging vaccinators for shots or admitting having lied about being pregnant or asthmatic.Dr. Schuchat also praised the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District in Illinois for its program for disabled children. Nurses give shots in the parking lot “so when parents bring the kids in with special needs, they don’t have to get out of the car,” she said.Children with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy and other neuromuscular diseases appear to be at the highest risk of dying from swine flu, she said, followed by children with severe asthma.Flu is widespread in 48 states, and virtually every sample taken is swine flu rather than seasonal flu, Dr. Schuchat said. More than half of all hospitalizations are of people under 25.As of Friday, 129 children had died of swine flu since April, and others who were not tested have died from flulike symptoms. Almost one-third had been healthy, with no underlying problems.About 38 million doses of vaccine are available now, Dr. Schuchat said.Canada had its own swine flu vaccine distribution brouhaha this week, and on Friday, a second member of the Alberta provincial health administration lost his job over it, according to The Edmonton Journal.Members of the Calgary Flames hockey team and their families had been allowed to avoid long public lines and get vaccinated at their arena on Oct. 30, one day before the province canceled mass immunizations after demand created a shortage.The flu is taking a toll on the National Hockey League. Members of the Boston Bruins, the New York Islanders, the Edmonton Oilers, the Colorado Avalanche, the Washington Capitals and the Detroit Red Wings have all been out sick recently, The Boston Globe reported.In Milwaukee, a truck containing 900 doses of swine flu vaccine was stolen as it idled outside a flu clinic Thursday night, The Associated Press reported.The police said it was found abandoned less than an hour later with the vaccine intact. But officials decided to throw the doses away; because the vaccine must be kept refrigerated and its sterility must be assured, it was considered compromised in that time outside the city’s custody.'"
"'09-11-07,'0','Any situation like this can strain a marriage to the breaking point. You can either disengage and get divorced or re-engage, said Sandra Wang, a Smith Barney who is a licensed marriage and family therapist and a certified divorce financial analyst.What follows are five of the financial issues that are most likely to cause strife and a few ideas about how to work them out.REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES If your household income and assets aren’t what they once were, it can be a real problem for spouses who are not living in the style to which they have become accustomed. You may have thought that neither of you could possibly be the kind of person who would feel this way, until you found yourself in the thick of it and were surprised you were contemplating leaving the marriage. “Do they decide to check out?” asked Ms. Wang, who is based in Palo Alto, Calif. “Because if they decide to re-engage, it means readjusting expectations about what married life is going to look like. Can they redefine a relationship that’s not based around the lifestyle?”YOUR MISTAKES When one person in the household is the chief financial officer, there’s just one place to point the finger when things go wrong. So in families where the price of the home has fallen, the adjustable-rate is resetting to a higher payment and the accounts have fallen 25 percent from their peak, the resident money manager sometimes comes under attack.“If you go into debt, you may smack your head and say ‘How could this have happened?’ and ‘You never told me we couldn’t afford this big of a house,’” said Lili A. Vasileff, a financial planner in Greenwich, Conn., who has taken to calling her work “marital financial mediation.”“But blame is not a Ping-Pong game,” she said. “This often happens because they didn’t realize that they weren’t making joint decisions.”The solution is more transparency and conversations about assets, debts and risk. But after years of letting the other grownup in the house make the decisions, people get out of the habit of keeping up with the details.YOUR PARENTS Some of the toughest financial problems that come up well into a marriage are those that feel like a choice between your spouse and another loved one.Take an aging parent who needs specialized care but has run out of money or can’t get the treatment that you and your siblings want to provide without everyone spending a lot of their own money.“Many couples find themselves in these situations ethically where they feel like they have to do something” to help a family member financially, said Jerry Gale, an associate professor of child and family development at the , where he’s part of an effort to integrate traditional therapy and financial planning. “But if I do that, what is the cost to my own family?”YOUR CHILDREN While the desire to do right by the children often keeps couples together, the financial challenges that children pose can be formidable.Ms. Vasileff, who is also the president of the Association of Divorce Financial Planners, said this sometimes comes up with a third child whose parents have bled the college savings dry paying for the first two children. “How do we not deprive our youngest child of what our other children had because we had more money then? Is that just life, that there is not enough left?” she said. “That really strikes hard between the two spouses.”Even if you manage to get the children educated, they may move home in their 20s expecting their old room back. “It really comes to a boiling point when a couple realizes that they have very different expectations for what will happen when their kids reach the age of majority and how their coming home could affect the couple’s postretirement years,” Ms. Vasileff said.YOUR UNCERTAINTY Most couples reckon with a sort of low-grade, long-term economic uncertainty that comes when so many people around them are losing their jobs. The stakes only get higher as you and your marriage age and you have children or other large financial responsibilities.Some people handle this better than others, but the pervasive that often results can slowly wear down a couple.It is possible, if you’re diligent early on and live below your means, to plan around many of these issues. A larger-than-average emergency fund can provide a better mental buffer against uncertainty. Starting early with college savings or buying long-term care for your parents will help, too.But few couples get everything right, which is why it’s a good idea to stop every so often and reassess how you’ve arranged your finances. Sometimes even the most basic practices deserve re-examination. Dan Icolari and his wife, who live in the St. George section of , have been married for 46 years. But about 20 years ago, they realized that their different approaches to money were the source of a lot of their arguments.“Rather than fighting, we decided to separate our bank accounts,” he said. “Once we did it, it instantly affected every other part of our relationship.”Over the course of a long marriage, you’re bound to run up against financial issues that you didn’t plan for. Or you may simply change your mind about your goals and how money affects them.“Step back from where you are, often in the heat of the emotions or frustration or anger,” said Mr. Gale, the professor. “I try to remind people to think about how they overcame stress and challenges in the past. I think couples, when things get stressful, it becomes ‘Here’s what I need to do or for you to do.’ But it’s really about what you can do together.”'"
"'09-11-07,'0','KABUL, Afghanistan — Two American soldiers are missing in western Afghanistan, a spokesman for the international forces said here on Friday, as a Taliban spokesman claimed that the insurgents had recovered the bodies of two drowned soldiers.A NATO spokesman said that he did not yet have information on whether the missing Americans were wounded in a battle with the Taliban and that there was no confirmation that the two were dead.“The search is ongoing, and we hope they are alive,” said the spokesman, Lt. Darin Russell of the United States Navy. An intensive search mission by a joint NATO and Afghan force ran into trouble, apparently after encountering insurgents, with 25 soldiers wounded, Lieutenant Russell said.The missing soldiers were paratroopers from the Fourth Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. They were on a resupply mission on Wednesday but did not return.“We are doing everything we can to find them,” said Capt. Jane Campbell of the United States Navy, a spokeswoman for the international forces.The Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, told Reuters by telephone that the bodies of the drowned soldiers had been recovered Wednesday in the western province of Badghis.'"

"'09-11-08,'0','Alice S. Rossi, a noted sociologist and feminist scholar who was a founder of the National Organization for Women, died on Tuesday in Northampton, Mass. She was 87 and lived in Amherst, Mass.The cause was pneumonia, her son, Peter E. Rossi, said.At her death, Professor Rossi was the Harriet Martineau professor of sociology emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, where she had taught from 1974 until her retirement in 1991.In her scholarship, Professor Rossi explored the status of women in work, family and sexual life. An early public advocate of abortion rights, she was often quoted by the national news media on an array of women’s issues. Her writings are widely credited with helping build the platform on which the women’s movement of the 1960s and afterward was erected.Professor Rossi was best known for her studies of people’s lives — those of women in particular — as they move from youth to age. She edited several books on the subject, including “Gender and the Life Course” (Aldine, 1985); “Sexuality Across the Life Course” (University of Chicago, 1994); and “Caring and Doing for Others: Social Responsibility in the Domains of Family, Work and Community” (University of Chicago, 2001).One of her most influential feminist articles was “Equality Between the Sexes: An Immodest Proposal.” First presented in 1963 at a meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, it was published the next year in the academy’s journal Daedalus.In the article, Professor Rossi argued that for most women motherhood had become a full-time occupation, a state of affairs that hurt not only women but also the larger society in which they lived. For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she wrote, parity of the sexes is essential.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','But more than 200 other studies have shown links between low doses of BPA and adverse health effects, according to the Breast Cancer Fund, which is trying to ban the chemical from food and beverage containers.“The vast majority of independent scientists — those not working for industry — are concerned about early-life low-dose exposures to BPA,” said Janet Gray, a Vassar College professor who is science adviser to the Breast Cancer Fund.Published journal articles have found that BPA given to pregnant rats or mice can cause malformed genitals in their offspring, as well as reduced sperm count among males. For example, a European journal found that male mice exposed to BPA were less likely to make females pregnant, and the Journal of Occupational Health found that male rats administered BPA had less sperm production and lower testicular weight.This year, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found that pregnant mice exposed to BPA had babies with abnormalities in the cervix, uterus and vagina. Reproductive Toxicology found that even low-level exposure to BPA led to the mouse equivalent of early puberty for females. And an array of animal studies link prenatal BPA exposure to breast cancer and prostate cancer.While most of the studies are on animals, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported last year that humans with higher levels of BPA in their blood have “an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and liver-enzyme abnormalities.” Another published study found that women with higher levels of BPA in their blood had more miscarriages.Scholars have noted some increasing reports of boys born with malformed genitals, girls who begin puberty at age 6 or 8 or even earlier, breast cancer in women and men alike, and declining sperm counts among men. The Endocrine Society, an association of endocrinologists, warned this year that these kinds of abnormalities may be a consequence of the rise of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and it specifically called on regulators to re-evaluate BPA.Last year, Canada became the first country to conclude that BPA can be hazardous to humans, and Massachusetts issued a public health advisory in August warning against any exposure to BPA by pregnant or breast-feeding women or by children under the age of 2.The Food and Drug Administration, which in the past has relied largely on industry studies — and has generally been asleep at the wheel — is studying the issue again. Bills are also pending in Congress to ban BPA from food and beverage containers.“When you have 92 percent of the American population exposed to a chemical, this is not one where you want to be wrong,” said Dr. Ted Schettler of the Science and Environmental Health Network. “Are we going to quibble over individual rodent studies, or are we going to act?”While the evidence isn’t conclusive, it justifies precautions. In my family, we’re cutting down on the use of those plastic containers that contain BPA to store or microwave food, and I’m drinking water out of a metal bottle now. In my reporting around the world, I’ve come to terms with the threats from warlords, bandits and tarantulas. But endocrine disrupting chemicals — they give me the willies.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','If the first act was a group crime with a willing audience, the second is the impulse of some students to dismiss it all as trivial, at worst a mere misadventure in which the victim was complicit.It can be felt in the hallways, as some students mutter and belittle the rape and trash-talk the victim, students said. It can be seen in the MySpace postings, highlighted by the Web site SFist, which attack the “snitches” who reported the crime.Teachers attribute some of the posturing to adolescent insensitivity or a strong current of street-gang culture. But teachers and community leaders also say the students, struggling with the incident, are playing down the brutality and blaming the victim to establish emotional distance.“I’ve seen this for years,” said Rhonda James, the executive director of the rape crisis center for Contra Costa and Marin Counties. “We have to ‘otherize’ the victim; otherwise we would live in fear and we wouldn’t get up in the morning.”Richmond has long been one of the poorest cities in the Bay Area. Residents have bristled at the publicity surrounding the rape, with its suggestions that the city is home to animals or savages. Community leaders point out that abuse of women is a national problem.The community has tried to pull together, as it did Tuesday with a rally and vigil attended by hundreds of people. The victim sent a statement: “We realize people are angry about this, but let the anger cause change; that is necessary to keep our children, our neighbors and our friends safe.”Patricia Gonzalez, the mother of three Richmond High students, said the rape “just makes me enormously sad.” She said that since the attacks, “I’ve become a lot more strict; I’m demanding a lot more communication. I tell them, ‘If you see anyone strange, anything that worries you, just get out of there.’ ”The police have arrested seven suspects ages 15 to 21, including one Richmond High student and several former students. Six are charged with multiple felonies; five face life in prison if convicted. During the assault, at least a dozen young men came and went, gawking and jeering as the girl was brutalized.“The people involved were not viewing our victim as a human being,” said Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond police. “We are actively looking for everyone who was there. If we can punish them for any role, we will.”Still, as in the hallways of any high school, the chatter can be raw. “People used to make fun of her,” Miqui Maciel, a 10th grader, said of the victim. “So when people found out who it was, they lost a lot of sympathy for her.”Fifteen days after the attack, the school remains divided.In two dozen conversations, teachers and the majority of students expressed frustration at how many students remained callously indifferent, if not antagonistic toward the victim.Summerlynn Sigler, an English teacher, said there were some boys planning to beat up the victim once she returned to school, on the grounds that she was to blame if her attackers received life sentences.Daisy Santoya, a ninth grader, said schoolmates had accused her of snitching and told her to watch her back after she went to the police with information.And some exasperated students said they could not understand why this particular rape was such a big deal. “What happened was bad,” said Abraham Tejeda, a sophomore. “I’m not going to lie, but she shouldn’t have put herself in that situation.”Fear may also play a role in the reactions. Lizeth Franco, the daughter of the principal and a senior at Richmond High, said she believed that many people were intimidated by the “no snitching” ethos. “People didn’t speak up because they were afraid,” Lizeth said, “not because they’re animals and savages.""Margarita Vargas, the first to report the rape to the police, is a former Richmond student. She told the 911 dispatcher, “Nobody wants to call the cops, so we decided to call the cops.”The police department had assigned four officers to the dance, but they did not see their role as patrolling the perimeter of the campus. Similarly, school administrators chaperoning remained at the dance. There were no parent volunteers.After a violent incident last year, the school district agreed to install bright lights in the courtyard and a new fence and security cameras around the campus. The project was in the works at the time of the rape; new lights have now been installed.As Mr. Franco, the principal, surveyed the scene of the crime last week, he said he could not understand how the young men could have turned into a brutal mob. He also could not comprehend how bystanders could have done nothing.“It baffles me,” he said as he pointed out the picnic table where the attack occurred. “It could have been my girl.”Thomas Plante, a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University and an adjunct clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, said patterns of social behavior changed when a group was involved. Individuals take less responsibility, he said, and are more likely to copy the behavior of those around them.“Teenagers are particularly vulnerable,” Professor Plante said. “They are not so comfortable in their own skins and don’t have enough self-esteem to say, ‘This is wrong.’ ”In a group discussion at the school, Jackie Solano, a slight 10th grader, said: “Why is there so much blame? How can people say things like that when most of them have sisters and mothers at home?”“There’s something in me that wants to do something,” Jackie added. “But women are always put in second place in society.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Re “Supply-Side Ideas, Turned Upside Down” (Economic View, Nov. 1), in which N. Gregory Mankiw said health care reform legislation now in Congress would raise the implicit marginal tax rates of many Americans:The word “tax” has become a goblin in our society, immediately eliciting responses like “Enough, we can’t bear any more!” or “High taxes kill initiative.”Isn’t it time to ask instead how much personal income we would forgo to ensure that we no longer have to depend on bake sales to pay for little Johnny’s life-saving treatment?Or how much less pay we would accept in order to travel over safe bridges — or to have safe food, adequate housing and good education and parks?In other words, it’s time to ask these questions: How much do low marginal tax rates affect the continued well-being of our society? And how does that society contribute to the personal pursuit of life, liberty and happiness — and economic success? Marie LoweThe column related a story that Ronald Reagan, while in Hollywood, chose to limit his number of films because of the higher marginal tax rate he would have paid by making more of them.But unlike highly paid actors, the struggling middle-income families of today often cannot afford to choose forgoing work, regardless of the tax rates involved.The column also doesn’t mention that the rapid growth of health care costs already has the effect of a tax increase on consumers.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Could this skepticism be a bullish omen, under the contrarian theory that a rising market climbs a so-called wall of worry? In this view, the more negative investors become, the more positive the market’s prospects.But a close look at these particular numbers shows that they aren’t a good contrarian indicator: a study by the Hulbert Financial Digest shows that the stock market generally has performed better following net inflows.For short-term market prediction, other sentiment measures — like the level of bullishness among investment advisory newsletters, the put-call ratio for equity options and surveys of the views of individual investors — have a better track record.Right now, these indicators generally show that while the market’s wall of worry has deteriorated in recent months, it is still strong enough to support somewhat higher prices. But it’s crucial to note that this contrarian-based optimism is strictly for the short term. Sentiment indicators have their greatest explanatory power at the three-month horizon; they tell us nothing about the longer term.Might the flow data shed some light on stocks’ longer-term prospects? Ned Davis, president and senior investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, a quantitative research firm that caters to institutional investors, believes that it can. In fact, he said, fund investors’ current skepticism suggests that the stock market faces, at best, several years of backing and filling, and possibly even a prolonged bear market.Why? He believes that the recent financial shock has given investors such a bad taste for stocks that it will take much lower valuations to whet their appetites again.ONE possibility is that the market will enter into a several-year trading range that would provide time for corporate earnings to improve and for price-to-earnings ratios to decline. This happened after the bear market of 1973-74. The institute’s figures show that fund investors behaved just as they have over the last couple of months — withdrawing assets, on balance, from stock mutual funds.A more ominous possibility is a major decline in stock prices, as occurred in Japan during the 1990s, Mr. Davis said.Over the short term, at least, contrarian analysis suggests that the market outlook is much brighter than this.

"'09-11-08,'0','New data show that small businesses have battened down the hatches in response to the recession.From the beginning of this year through Sept. 30, sales at small businesses (privately held companies with revenue of $10 million or less) have fallen 3.75 percent, according to figures from Sageworks Inc. At the same time, net profit at these businesses has risen to 6.5 percent. How have they accomplished this? By cutting their costs. Overhead, payroll and advertising as a percentage of sales have all declined.The numbers show that small companies have “reacted strongly and appropriately” to survive the downturn, said Drew B. White, the chief financial officer of Sageworks.When you are a small business and your survival is at stake, it is hard to take financial and strategic risks, which generally require extra spending.“I am not looking to privately held small business to lead us out of this recession,” Mr. White said.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Now calls “The Red Shoes” “one of the true miracles of film history.” He long ago began an obsessive campaign to restore Powell’s reputation. His Film Foundation and the Film and Television Archive have taken the lead in digitally alchemizing the movie from cracked, shrunk, moldy negatives.Scorsese fell in love with the movies of Powell and Pressburger when he was an asthmatic kid living in a four-room tenement apartment in New York, watching “Million Dollar Movie” on TV and going to theaters with his dad.“They have a flair and flamboyance you don’t usually find in films being made at that time,” he told me. “And a fearlessness about emotion. They create worlds that take no prisoners.”In their 1947 movie about a lustful nun in the Himalayas, played by — they seemed drawn to redheads for Technicolor — the sister faints from sexual desire and the screen goes orange. “That’s such a wonderful way to express desire,” Scorsese marveled.In a letter to Kerr in the early ’40s, Pressburger laid out their manifesto, including: “No artist believes in escapism. And we secretly believe that no audience does. We have proved, at any rate, that they will pay to see the truth, for no other reason than her nakedness.”In the early ’70s, Scorsese tracked down the broke and discredited Powell in London and took him to a pub.“Michael was very surprised to hear that his films had thrilled a younger audience and given fuel to the imagination of myself and and Francis Coppola,” Scorsese once recalled. “He went home that night and recorded in his diary that he felt his blood course through his veins again after meeting us in the bar.”In 1980, Coppola invited Powell to become a consultant at Zoetrope Studios. He moved to America and married Scorsese’s film editor, .It is interesting that Powell twice counseled Scorsese against the color red. He didn’t like the red boxing gloves in the early rushes of and urged Scorsese to switch to a black-and-white film. (He did.) Powell told him had too much red lighting and he should take some out. (He didn’t.)“The Red Shoes” is based on a fairy tale of the same name about a little girl who becomes vain about her red shoes and gets confused about her priorities. As in the movie, the shoes force the girl to dance day and night, and then she dies. But the fable has an even grimmer coda: The girl asks an executioner to cut off her feet.The shimmering Moira Shearer could never take off the red shoes, either.“To be constantly associated with that one film is really quite dismaying,” she once said. “It’s as though I’d done nothing else in my life. I mean, it’s odd, when you’re 61, to be haunted by something you’ve done when you were 21!”She resisted doing the movie, finding the script “silly and banal”; she feared it would deflect her from a classical ballet career. And when she died at 80 in 2006, her husband dismissively called her film work “a bit of a distraction.”Shearer said she faced hostility when she returned to the ballet world from some who considered her overnight movie fame frivolous. She always worried that she was succeeding more for her looks than her dancing.She was eclipsed by Margot Fonteyn, married, had four children and receded. She wrote a book about her experiences with . As wrote in Dance Magazine, “She had a disappointing and disappointed dance career.”In later years, Shearer was asked to give her occupation in'"
"'09-11-08,'0','In Los Angeles, for instance, credit card machines are often in the front seat, forcing riders to hand their cards to the driver. Business this year is off about 15 percent, according to fleet owners, mirroring national trends in the industry.In New York, however, revenues have risen about 13 percent from the end of last year, according to data collected by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. And tips, which hovered around 10 percent when cab rides were cash only, averaged 22 percent on credit-card transactions this fall.“Credit cards helped the New York industry stay stable in a time when the rest of the for-hire industry was in significant decline,” said Alfred LaGasse, chief executive officer of the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association, a national trade group.Taxi fleets in Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas and the suburbs of Washington are all beginning to experiment with back-seat card readers similar to those in New York, Mr. LaGasse said.Once considered a convenient payment method for longer trips, often to the area’s airports, credit cards are now being used for shorter, cheaper rides, the type of $5 rainy-day indulgences that were once handled exclusively with cash.Amos Tamam, president of VeriFone Transportation Systems, whose card readers are in 6,700 cabs, or about half of the city’s fleet, said his company’s average credit-card fare is now less than $15, down from $16 a year ago.“The more usage you get with credit cards, the lower the average ticket is going to go,” Mr. Tamam said.Passengers said that paying with credit cards has become second nature. “Any time I take a cab, I pay with a card, on the advice of my accountant,” said Michelin Hall of Manhattan, after swiping his American Express card in a taxi outside Pennsylvania Station the other day. Mr. Hall said that with cards, “it’s easy to track the receipts, it can tell you how long the cab ride was and where you went” — convenient information when he files expenses for his job in marketing.The increase in tips, however, may have less to do with New Yorkers’ generosity than with the preset amounts suggested to passengers on the taxi’s software systems. In many of the city’s cabs, riders are offered options for their tip depending on the length of the ride. For fares under $15, a screen prompts tips of $2, $3 or $4; the numbers can range from 15 percent to 30 percent for higher fares. The presets are used about 70 percent of the time, according to industry estimates.New York’s success seemed unlikely a year ago, when the last of the city’s 13,000 cabs were outfitted with credit-card readers, part of an initiative started in 2007 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The city was reeling from a maelstrom on Wall Street that disproportionately affected the high-income industries that drive the New York economy.And riders were still reporting unpleasant run-ins with drivers who refused to accept the cards or pressured customers to pay with cash, a resentment left over from a two-day strike in September 2007 that forced officials to institute an ad-hoc system for shared rides.But in 2008, taxi officials began noticing a trend: Cab business was staying steady, and credit card use was on the rise.At the end of last year, about one-fifth of cab rides were being paid for with a card. That portion has grown steadily this year, reaching 28 percent in September, the latest month for which data was available. Meanwhile, black-car business has fallen about 30 percent, as companies encourage employees to use corporate credit cards to expense cheaper yellow-cab rides.“It’s becoming a way of life in the taxi world,” said Matthew W. Daus, New York’s taxi commissioner. “New Yorkers are getting more accustomed to going around without cash. We think it’s a good thing.”In interviews, drivers acknowledged that business had improved, but still groused about the credit card machines. The higher tips are tempered by a 5 percent service fee applied to fares that are paid with plastic. Drivers must also wait anywhere from a day to a week to retrieve their fare money paid by credit cards, and they said the machines occasionally break down, resulting in lost fares.“Because of credit cards we get customers, that’s true,” said Muhammed Hamid, 35, of Queens. “But if they give us cash, you can put the gas on that; you don’t have to wait three, four days.”Told of the statistics that showed higher tips, some drivers scoffed. “I know that’s not true,” said William Lindauer, a driver and coordinating member of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. “They get no tips, or less tips.”A random survey suggested otherwise. Several drivers were asked to share their credit receipts after their shifts. Of 20 receipts reviewed, the average tip came out to just over 18 percent. The preset tip amounts were used more than half the time, resulting in a $5.30 ride getting a tip of $2, or about 38 percent.It may be difficult, however, for other cities to recreate New York’s success. “Not all agencies in other cities have the same tools, manpower and budget to do what New York City did,” said Mr. Tamam of VeriFone. And New York’s fleet, the largest in the country, has a bigger customer base that can help justify the high cost of installing more advanced credit card technology.Some drivers suggested, paradoxically, that the recession itself may be prompting greater credit card use. Simon Palade, a driver for more than 40 years, said he sees far more cash fares around the first of the month, when paychecks are often issued.“After that it slows down and they’ve got to use plastic more and more,” Mr. Palade, 59, of Sunnyside, Queens, said the other day, as he navigated a Central Park transverse. “People don’t got no money. They’re banking on the future.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','“We were watching the games, and it was sickening to look at these teams and how many big plays are made because of missed tackles,” said the retired safety Rodney Harrison, who is an analyst for NBC.From their first practice at Pop Warner, players are taught to put their face mask into the ball carrier’s chest, wrap him up with their arms and explode with their hips into the runner. But once the N.F.L.’s regular season starts, full-speed tackling happens only on Sunday.It was not always like that. Tony Dungy, a former coach and current NBC analyst, recalled that when he played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Coach Chuck Noll never held a practice that was not in full pads, even on Friday, the lightest day of the practice week. There was contact every day, although defenders were told not to explode through their hits or bring an offensive player to the ground.“You got used to hitting and tackling,” Dungy said.But that was before the salary cap and roster limits. A hard cap and soft tissue do not mix, and avoiding injuries during practice is now the primary concern for teams.By the time Dungy became the Indianapolis coach, players even had pad-free days in training camp. If the Colts played a Monday night game, they would practice for the next game with no pads, in an effort to spare their bodies. The Colts never practiced in pads on Fridays, and late in the season, as players wore down, Dungy would call for no pads on Thursdays.So while his players still practiced technique — taking the correct angle to the ball or at most wrapping up the ball carrier before releasing him — the physical aspect of tackling was virtually absent.LaMarr Woodley, a linebacker for the Steelers, who are considered one of the best tackling teams, said: “People take for granted that you can just go in there, hit somebody and make the tackle. It’s harder than people think. It’s something you’ve definitely got to work on to prepare, and have to practice during the week.”And when teams do not?“Those are the teams that miss a lot of tackles,” Woodley said.Wide-open passing attacks have complicated matters, encouraging complex defenses. Players and coaches say more time is spent teaching the nuances of a defense than on tackling technique. And it is much harder to make an open-field tackle, particularly if the ball carrier is the size of the 6-foot-4 Brandon Jacobs or has the quickness of Percy Harvin, than one near the line of scrimmage where there is plenty of help.Breakdowns in technique are more apparent in the open field, particularly if a defender takes the wrong angle to catch a ball carrier. The Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson lamented about how often he sees defenders, frequently in the secondary, reaching or lunging to make tackles, hoping to grab a jersey or an ankle instead of getting their bodies into the plays. Earlier this year, a Cleveland Browns defender was so far away from the Green Bay Packers’ Ryan Grant that John Lynch, calling the game for Fox, said, “It wouldn’t have been a tackle in flag football.”“When you see the ball carrier in the open field and the defender is coming at him, we say close the ground where the ball carrier could make a move,” said Rod Woodson, a Hall of Fame defensive back who is an NFL Network analyst. “We see today even the slowest quarterbacks are putting moves on defenders. It’s because when they come to the ball carrier, defenders are stopping their feet. They stop 3 or 4 yards in front of him, and now the ball carrier has the defender at his mercy.”The prevalence of the pass has put a premium on covering a receiver to deter a quarterback from throwing to him instead of on sounder tackling.“There was no such thing as a cover corner with the Steel Curtain,” Dungy said. “That means I’m only out there in the passing game, my job is to intercept and cover the receiver and you do the rest. Cover corner was a code word for I’m not very physical. We have a lot of guys like that.”The most common complaint among active players is that penalties devised to protect players from injury — like flags for a horse-collar tackle or hitting a defenseless receiver — have narrowed the scope of acceptable tackling and may cause a critical moment’s hesitation for defenders who fear being penalized and fined.Lynch said he made a conscious decision not to worry about fines during his career, fearing it would subtly alter his hard-hitting style of play. But for many current players, the uncertainty of what constitutes a legal hit complicates an already difficult task.“Whenever the mentality of the game changes, the mentality of the defender changes,” said Pittsburgh safety Troy Polamalu, one of football’s best tacklers.The mentality may be starting to change back. Lynch said he noticed that some teams held more physical training camps this summer, the Jets, the Denver Broncos and the Jaguars among them. And as with the Jaguars last week, full pads are coming back in vogue in the hope that a throwback skill will return with them.“The message was go back to the basics and fundamentals,” Lynch said. “Sometimes, it takes chronically bad tackling. It’s kind of old school.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Certainly, those inclined to argue that commercial life has been remade are frequently chastened when — as often happens — the dusty old laws of economics reassert themselves.During the technology boom of the 1990s, some hailed a New Economy that supposedly liberated us from the tyranny of the business cycle while explaining how companies that never earned a nickel could be worth more than established brands. When arithmetic returned, the New Economy became synonymous with silliness.This decade, as investors bid housing prices to levels that breached all connection to incomes, some economists argued that the booms and busts of real estate had been rendered inoperative by financial innovation. We know how that turned out.But the latest reassessment of the business cycle now has a couple of decades of data to consider. After recession gave way to expansion in March 1991, it took a year before hiring resumed in earnest — a so-called jobless recovery. After the following recession ended in March 2001, two years passed before jobs grew. Many economists assume that the third straight jobless recovery has already begun, as nervous businesses — worried about the lingering bite of the financial crisis and weak prospects — continue to hold back on hiring.This is not how things are supposed to go, not according to our traditional view of the business cycle. When the economy is growing, businesses hire aggressively as they increase production and sell more goods. As workers spend their paychecks, they distribute dollars throughout the economy, creating business opportunities that prompt other companies to hire — a virtuous cycle. As growth slows, companies let people go, then hire anew when new opportunities emerge.Our unemployment insurance system is built for this kind of boom and bust cycle, giving furloughed workers some cash to tide them over until their companies call them back.But as Mr. Sinai and his colleagues see things, our view of the business cycle is antiquated. They say it fails to account for the critical role of finance and changing appetites for risk that can influence economic growth; that, crucially, it dates to a time when manufacturing employed roughly one-third of the American workforce, well before what we now call the global economy.In the middle of the last century, a retailer in Chicago who needed goods likely had to place an order with a factory in the Midwest. Today, that retailer could well be part of a conglomerate that taps a global supply chain; it sends its orders to workers in China and elsewhere, or to domestic factories that can increase production without hiring many more people, either by further automating or by bringing in temporary workers.Of course, automation can itself create extra factory jobs for American firms that make robotics, and these companies increasingly export their gear to the same factories in China that produce goods now landing on shelves in Chicago. Yet the overall trend appears to make many American companies less inclined to hire, reluctant to take on cost in an increasingly competitive marketplace.Not everyone buys into this view. Labor-oriented economists like Lawrence Mishel at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington argue that the business cycle works the same as it always did; the problem is that economic growth has been weak in recent times.“When growth comes back,” Mr. Mishel said, “so will jobs.”Others suggest that the business cycle has not changed, but rather that we have developed unrealistic assumptions about the bounty that should accrue in good times. In this view, our expectations have been perverted by an unhealthy reliance on credit in recent years.Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of a history of financial crises, “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” recalls that when he was a graduate student, most economists viewed the normal level of unemployment to be about 7 percent.But over the last decade, as the Federal Reserve relied upon excessively low interest rates to spur economic activity, the norm slipped steadily lower, with some proclaiming that unemployment had effectively been tamed and could remain permanently in the vicinity of 5 percent.As Mr. Rogoff portrays it, what may seem like weak hiring in recent times is really just a return to normal. Eventually, after the lingering dysfunction of the financial crisis gives way to a more healthy flow of money, enabling more businesses to borrow and expand, unemployment will settle in to a long-term average of about 6 percent, he says.In other words, recession still turns to expansion, much as spring follows winter, but the warm months may not be as bountiful as in years past, when easy money fertilized outlandish crop production.In any event, we’d best get ready for leaner harvests.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','SEATTLE (AP) — Hurried repairs at a badly weakened flood-control reservoir have greatly reduced but far from eliminated the risk of flooding this winter in the Green River Valley near Seattle, the Army Corps of Engineers said last week.The region has been preparing for flooding ever since a torrential storm in January weakened an abutment to an important upstream dam that holds back the Green River. Residents and businesses have been piling up sandbags, and the corps has been working around the clock on repairs to shore up the abutment. Most of the repairs were completed in the last week.Col. Anthony Wright, the corps’ Seattle district commander, provided an update Thursday on the dam repairs. He said there was now a 1-in-25 chance that a storm would force the corps to release enough water from the dam’s reservoir to cause a flood downstream in the Green River Valley. The odds of widespread flooding improve to 1-in-32 when all the sandbagging and flood-protection efforts are factored in.Previously, the Corps of Engineers said the chance of widespread flooding was 1-in-4. While that is “a substantial change in the risk for the people downstream,” the danger is still very high and the preparations in the valley were critical, Colonel Wright said.“It was really bad before and it’s now just bad,” he said.Residents, businesses and local governments in the long, flat valley have been working feverishly to fortify their property and the levees along the river against a potentially catastrophic flood during the winter rainy season. The corps has estimated that beyond the human cost, a flood could cause $4 billion in damage.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Now the bank’s shares have more than doubled in value, making that stock and option award worth nearly $12 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif.That executive is just one of many Wall Street workers who have seen the bonuses they received last year soar in value, even though some of the shares cannot be sold for a few years.Goldman’s bonus pool last year was $4.82 billion, according to the New York attorney general’s office, but because about half of that was paid in stock, it is now worth upwards of $7.8 billion. At JPMorgan Chase, workers have seen the value of the stock awarded them last year increase at least $3 billion.“People have to look at the sizable gains that have been made since stock and options were granted last year, and the fact is this was, in many ways, a windfall,” said Jesse M. Brill, the chairman of CompensationStandards.com, a trade publication. “This had nothing to do with people’s performance. These were granted at market lows.”Wall Street has long used a mix of stock and cash for bonuses. But the greater emphasis on cash before the financial crisis began meant executives could walk away rich even as their companies collapsed.That has left many on Wall Street — and in Washington — demanding that a greater portion of pay be made in stock in hopes of rewarding long-term performance rather than short-term bets.The Treasury’s special master of pay, Kenneth R. Feinberg, has said there is “too much reliance on cash” on Wall Street and has proposed stock as an alternative.Banks began the trend by paying more in stock last year. Then, in February, Congress required that bonuses at bailed-out banks be paid entirely in stock. Last month, the Treasury Department took the idea further by proposing that some executives’ salaries be paid in stock. The result is that Wall Street workers have more of their pay at risk than ever.Still, some compensation experts say the risk has been decreased by the government’s backing of the financial system and historically low stock prices. After all, they point out, companies like JPMorgan, American Express and Capital One issued stock and options last year when their share prices had little chance of going anywhere but up.The stock gains raise questions about the wisdom of pushing pay too far in either direction, favoring either cash or stock. Normal theories about stock compensation and risk-taking may not hold true today, compensation experts say, in large part because of the government’s continued financial support of the industry.And they say the upside at many banks is far bigger than the downside, particularly for banks like Bank of America and Citigroup that have not yet seen their shares recover.“Right now the world is set up for these people to take big gambles,” said Kevin J. Murphy, a professor at the University of Southern California who advised the Treasury Department on pay. “The worst part of the asymmetry comes from the too-big-to-fail guarantee” that has been reinforced by the government aid.Wells Fargo was one of more than a dozen major banks to award executives stock and options since the bailout. In February, the bank gave nearly three million options and roughly 528,000 shares to 11 executives. On paper, the grants have risen in value to $57.3 million from $12.1 million, according to Equilar.Pat Callahan, one of the Wells Fargo executives to receive the grants, said the bank’s board always considers equity grants in February.“Of course in February the price was very low, but nobody knew what was going to happen,” she said. “It’s true that the stock price change from February to now is a mix of economic recovery and things that we’ve done.”The Wells Fargo options start to become available early next year, though executives there are not allowed to sell more than half of them until a year after they retire. Of course, the stock could fall rather than rise before then, as could shares of other banks like Goldman or JPMorgan.The stock payouts strike some experts as a way to simply defer windfalls into the future.“The stock doesn’t bother me. What bothers me are the gross amounts,” said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware. “Most people are focused on cash payments, and they ignore the stock. When you issue stock in a period of economic distress, you’ve often given someone a gift.”Many financial workers, of course, do not consider their compensation a gift, despite widespread criticism of their high pay.And some pay experts point to stock losses on Wall Street in recent years. Ira T. Kay, the head of compensation at the consulting firm Watson Wyatt, said, “No one’s looking to give them sympathy, but it’s not correct to say they haven’t felt the pain of their shareholders.”Still, at some banks, like Goldman and JPMorgan, the stock in the bonus pools from 2006 and 2007 has almost fully recovered its value.For upcoming compensation at Citigroup and Bank of America, the Treasury required the banks to pay executives almost entirely in stock. That means if performance goals are met, 19 executives at Citigroup would split $113 million in stock this year and 12 executives at Bank of America would share in $75.6 million in stock. (Each bank is also paying roughly $5 million of these executives’ salaries in cash.)But greater upside lurks. If Citigroup’s stock returns to its early 2008 price of $29, from just above $4 on Friday, the executives’ shares from this year alone would be worth more than $800 million. Even if the stock rose to only $12, their shares would be worth $340 million.At Bank of America, seven executives could see their pay packages become worth more than $10 million apiece if the bank’s stock increases just $10. A bank spokesman, Bob Stickler, said, “Under that scenario, executives get paid because the shareholders are being paid.”The Treasury Department declined to comment when asked if these bank executives were being set up for windfalls. Lucian A. Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor who advised Treasury on pay rules, said, “What should we have done differently?”“It would be better if you could take the stock and somehow neutralize what the government did, but that’s really tricky,” he said. “If you have equity compensation, sometimes there are massive windfalls.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','If the initiatives that Project H Design has taken on seem largely geared toward young people — Learning Landscape playgrounds and sustainable food programs for public schools, to name but two — it may have something to do with the fact that Emily Pilloton, the founder of the not even two-year-old humanitarian organization, is herself only 27.

"'09-11-08,'0','THE big news on July 15, 1969, was the countdown for the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. But the writer Lary Bloom remembers it as the day his boyhood friend Harmon Polster, a 25-year-old United States Air Force navigator, went down in a nighttime crash in Laos. Airmen in nearby jets thought they saw the fiery end, but they couldn’t tell whether Lieutenant Polster or the pilot had been able to eject. Their names were added to the country’s growing list of those missing in action.Mr. Bloom, who served in the Vietnam War on the ground, doing relatively safer work, was luckier. He returned home and became a writer and editor with a variety of books and magazines on his résumé (his columns on Connecticut life appeared regularly in the weekly Connecticut section of The New York Times for several years). But the fate of his friend nagged at him. When he started collecting material for a book on the struggle families faced trying to resolve the status of their loved ones who were missing in action, he met Kay Polster, Lieutenant Polster’s widow. Mr. Bloom never wrote the book, but he made the Polsters’ story the heart of a new play, “Wild Black Yonder”; its world premiere is Nov. 12 at the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center, known as the Kate, in Old Saybrook.Jeanie Rapp, the founder of the Margreta Stage Company, commissioned the play and is directing. “This has been an indispensable collaboration,” Mr. Bloom said. “I’m writing for somebody who knows the realities of the stage much better than I do. I’m good at putting words on paper. But words on paper are not words that easily translate to the stage.”The play is heavily fictionalized — Janet Peckinpaugh, whose career as a newscaster has made her familiar to Connecticut television viewers, plays a woman whose memories of the young husband declared missing decades ago prevent her from fully committing to the man she lives with. Mr. Bloom wanted to write about what he calls “the black hole of Vietnam” and its contemporary resonances. But also, he said, “I wanted to write a love story.”He had always meant to be a journalist, but he got involved in college theater in a big way. “I almost flunked out because I couldn’t extricate myself from the dressing room,” he said. “Theater was a genuine love, but then I had to go out and make a living.” He did write the lyrics for a musical, “A Woman of a Certain Age,” that was produced at the Ivoryton Playhouse. And Ms. Rapp held readings of an earlier play, “Worth Avenue.” So while the theater hasn’t been his main focus, he said, “It’s always been there in my head.” And then he corrected himself: “In my heart.”Shortly after he finished “Wild Black Yonder,” fate wrote an end to Harmon Polster’s story. Two bones unearthed in Laos contained DNA that confirmed his identity. In July, the remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery, and one more name was removed from the list of America’s missing in action.'"

"'09-11-08,'0','The apartment sits like a little red-brick hat atop Colonnade Row, a series of 19th-century marble town houses on Lafayette Street.Mr. Warner, a native of Washington, D.C., came to New York in 1973 and moved into the apartment in 1978 when Bruce Mailman, the East Village entrepreneur who owned the building, made him an irresistible offer.“He told me he had an apartment he wanted me to move into, but said it needed massive work,” Mr. Warner recalled. “He promised to give me cheap rent in return for renovation.”Initially, the rent was $250, remarkably low even then, for what Mr. Warner describes as “a wreck.” By 1982, the rent had bumped up to $350. It stayed that way until 1999, when Mr. Warner himself, immensely grateful for the arrangement, raised it to $500.His motives, he acknowledges, were not purely altruistic. Eight years earlier, a modest little production by three performance artists who called themselves Blue Man Group had moved into the Astor Place Theater, which was housed on the ground floor. The year Mr. Warner voluntarily raised his own rent, the building was poised to be sold to the producers of the show, and his thinking was that a slightly higher figure would make him look better to a future landlord. The sale took place in 2001.Over the past three decades, Mr. Warner has transformed a ramshackle space whose walls were home to an army of mice and roaches into a smartly designed setting that serves as both home and office. Mr. Warner, who in 1998 founded the Twilight Theater Company, a low-overhead organization dedicated to the creation of new plays, and is its co-artistic director, uses the apartment for meetings and rehearsals. Visitors have told him it feels as snug and efficiently organized as a ship’s cabin.The thick wooden beams in the ceiling stayed, as did the brick walls and the original windowpanes. But virtually everything else is different. Mr. Warner installed insulation between the beams where there had been only tarpaper and roof board (and leaks). He built skylights, graceful arches and a loft that functions as a guest room and storage space. He rewired the entire apartment (he is also a skilled electrician) and sanded the floors.To accommodate his 6-foot-9 frame, he built a kitchen in which everything is slightly higher than normal. The refrigerator sits on risers, and the sink and countertops are 39 inches above the floor — several inches above average — so Mr. Warner doesn’t have to stoop when he cooks.He also built the bed, the couch and other items of furniture using pieces of wood he found in Dumpsters. To make the place more commodious for his wife (Mr. Warner was married from 1983 to 1989), he created a double-size clothes closet and a bathroom mirror framed with oversize bulbs — very movie-star.These days, the décor includes whimsical pastel-colored drawings by his girlfriend, an animator and filmmaker named Signe Baumane. Because Mr. Warner designs and builds sets for his own shows, stashed away in various out-of-the-way nooks and crannies are pieces of cardboard, great swaths of fabric, recycled wood and random items of hardware.It would be no exaggeration to say that Mr. Warner is almost pathologically well organized. His drawers are stuffed with Playbills, theatrical programs and scripts dating back to the 1970s and meticulously organized by location (Broadway, Off Broadway), category (workshops, readings) and date.And as a reminder that a hard-core member of the city’s theatrical community is in residence, hanging from the bedroom ceiling are red and white wooden signs touting a play called “Comedians” salvaged decades ago from the street. (“An Uproarious Romp” — A.P., “A Lot of Good Laughs” — NBC-TV, and “Majestically Funny” — The Daily News, in case you’re wondering what the critics said when the play opened on Broadway in 1976.)But Mr. Warner’s days here may be numbered.After the sale in 2001, the producers of Blue Man Group started taking steps to buy out tenants. They plan to use the apartments as their own residences, something that is allowed under the law.Mr. Warner’s lease expired on Sept. 30, and his landlords have told him it will not be renewed. The subject of a buyout was broached, he said, adding that no specific figure was mentioned. Although he expects an eviction notice any day, he plans to fight it in court, and estimates that the fight could buy him at least a year. He is pinning his hopes on legislation pending in Albany that would protect him.Also, in 2006 he won a victory in the city’s Housing Court that allowed him to keep his unusually low rent. That makes him optimistic about his chances this time around.Mr. Warner is fighting to keep his apartment in part because he knows that replicating what he has, in terms of both space and quality, would be impossible.“To ask me to give this up is asking a lot,” he said. “It’s my blood, sweat and tears. I’m lucky and grateful to have it.”He also sees his crusade as part of a larger struggle. Year by year, it becomes increasingly difficult for young people to come to New York and make a career in the arts, as Mr. Warner himself did decades ago.On a wall near a window that faces the Public Theater hangs a tiny image of a handsome young man with shoulder-length hair. This is Mr. Warner’s hack license, which expired on May 31, 1974, a memento of his first job in the city.“When I first came to New York in 1973, I drove a cab twice a week and it paid for everything,” he said. “Today, kids need a full-time job just to make ends meet.“To be an artist in New York,” he added, “low overhead is everything. It’s what kept me in the city. If you have low overhead, you have a show.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Scott Westerfeld’s “Leviathan” is a tightly paced young adult novel set in an alternate version of the First World War and a welcome addition to the steampunk genre: a neo-retro period adventure. Just as cyberpunk reimagined science fiction with computers, steampunk reinvents it through a fantasy of the technological past. Its signature style is a whimsical Jules Verne-ian, 19th-century take on high technology — gadgets, gauges and goggles take the place of circuits and fusion reactors. Its genteel heroes and heroines display both the pluck of idealized Victorian adven­turers and their understanding of formal dress.Westerfeld is best known for his sci-fi Uglies series (“Pretties,” “Specials,” “Extras,” etc.), about a future society in which people have a surgical procedure at age 16 that makes their faces beautiful but their minds frivolous and easily controlled. “Leviathan” is different. If it poses a big question, that question would be, Wouldn’t it be cool if the First World War had been fought with genetically engineered mutant animals, against steam-­powered walking machines like the ones from “The Empire Strikes Back”? And the answer is, Yes, it would.The book begins the night the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated and his son, Aleksandar, flees his home near Prague to escape being made a target or a tool as the potential heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. (Aleksandar is an invention, but like Ferdinand’s real children, he is not a fully legitimate heir to royal lands or titles, since his mother has “common blood.”) At the other end of Europe, a working-class Scottish girl named Deryn disguises herself as a boy to join the British Air Service. Intrigue and political instability sweep the teenagers out of their normal lives and into a world at war.It’s not quite our world. In this version of history, Europe is divided between two rival technological cultures, a Mac-versus-PC contest on a geopolitical scale. The British, the “Darwinists,” have mastered the science of bioengineering. The Central European powers are the “Clankers,” and they use airplanes, zeppelins and walking machines that tramp through forests and fields. (We aren’t told what the French do, and I think that’s for the best.)“Leviathan” shines when it lets us inhabit these cultures. British society is permeated by its signature technology, an inventive living infrastructure of a thousand elements, from lizards that can mimic and record voices to tigerlike beasts of burden to the leviathan of the title, a living dirigible grown on the genetic chassis of a whale. This marvelous creature makes a lovely entrance:“The Leviathan’s body was made from the life threads of a whale, but a hundred other species were tangled into its design, countless creatures fitting to­gether like the gears of a stopwatch. . . . The motivator engines changed pitch, nudging the creature’s nose up. The airbeast obeyed, cilia along its flanks undulating like a sea of grass in the wind — a host of tiny oars rowing backward, slowing the Leviathan almost to a halt. The huge shape drifted slowly overhead, blotting out the sky.”Westerfeld’s imagery is enhanced by Keith Thompson’s old-fashioned black-and-white illustrations, which lend an extra dimension of reality to this world. And the Darwinist and Clanker jargon crackles with an authentically techie feel. Who wouldn’t want to go up in a “Huxley ascender” or pilot a “Wotan-class land frigate”? If Westerfeld has a signature foible, however, it’s a weakness for vintage slang that ends up being more distracting than colorful. No amount of repetition made “Barking spiders!” feel like a natural exclamation.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Look, a poem either sends you a bill or writes you a check. You can use up too much of your intellectual and emotional capital, not to mention your good will, and come away feeling had. Or you can pat your billfold and say, “Hey, this baby just got a little fatter.”When I’m asked by fellow air passengers what I do for a living and reply, “I write poems,” the reaction is often a startled smile, as though they’re thinking Homer! Dante! Milton! (At least that’s what I’m thinking they’re thinking.) And then comes the lean-in, the furrowed brow, the voice thick with compassion as my new friend says, “But there isn’t any money in that, is there?”There are some pretty snappy comebacks to this one, but what I usually offer is Somerset Maugham’s “Poetry is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five.” Actually, Maugham says “money,” not “poetry,” but that’s the point. Money and poetry both act as catalysts, and they bring together objects and experiences that wouldn’t have anything to do with one another otherwise. Wealth takes many forms, and sometimes it shows up as stanzas.Amy Gerstler makes this clear in “For My Niece Sidney, Age Six,” the first poem in her delightful new collection, “Dearest Creature.” Like good aunts the world over, she dispenses the info that moms and dads are too squeamish to traffic in, beginning with a factoid that would delight any red-blooded child: the death by boiling of one Margaret Davy in 1542 for poisoning her employer. This is the kind of thing you can discover in any encyclopedia, though no reference book ever breathesa word about the fact that this humming,aromatic, acid-flashback, pungent, tinglyfingered world is acted out differentlyfor each one of us by the puppet theaterof our senses. Some of us grow up doingcredible impressions of model citizens(though sooner or later hairlinecracks appear in our facades). The restget dubbed eccentrics, unnerved and undoneby other people’s company, for which wenevertheless pine. Curses, outbursts,and distracting chants simmer all daylong in the Crock-Pots of our heads.Thing is, nobody knows why Margaret slipped her boss the fatal dose. Now poetry can’t necessarily supply the facts that are omitted in reference books, but at least it permits speculation of the type practiced here, in which an aunt draws on her own experience and the best of her instincts to school a little girl in life’s complexities.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','The Cadillac division of General Motors has seen better days, with woeful sales figures even compared with those of other brands in the slumping luxury-car market. Yet the name Cadillac is thriving, at least on Capitol Hill. A centerpiece of legislation seeking to rein in health care costs is a tax on “Cadillac plans,” the favored shorthand for high-cost insurance policies. At the very high end are “gold-plated Cadillac plans,” or even “super-gold-plated Cadillac plans,” to use President Obama’s turn of phrase. How has the Cadillac brand survived as a stand-in for luxury, even as the cars themselves have lost much of their cachet?Cadillacs have been a symbol of prestige ever since the first ones were rolled out in 1902, but the association was solidified in the 1920s by the G.M. chairman Alfred P. Sloan, who aligned each of the company’s car models with a stage of social mobility — and placed Cadillac at the top of the ladder. “G.M. ushered you into auto ownership with a modestly priced Chevy and then encouraged you to aspire to an Olds, a Pontiac, a Buick and — at the pinnacle — a Cadillac,” explains Nancy Friedman, a branding consultant based in Oakland, Calif. “So the notion of upward mobility, aspiration and ‘the best’ were built into the brand almost from the start.”The Chevrolet-to-Cadillac hierarchy offered a convenient ranking system for other lines of consumer products marketed with gradations of quality and price. When Lucien Wulsin, the head of the Baldwin Piano Company, was interviewed by the magazine Sales Management in 1932, he drew an explicit parallel between his product line and G.M.’s, calling the Baldwin grand piano “the Cadillac of our line, just as our other models can be compared to the Buick, Oldsmobile and the Chevrolet models of General Motors.”While Cadillac was taking on the broader meaning of “the highest quality (of something),” a similar semantic evolution was happening in England with Rolls-Royce. The Oxford English Dictionary records a 1916 usage from William A. Robson’s book “Aircraft in War and Peace,” which spoke of “the best pleasure aeroplane, the Rolls-Royce of the air.” American airmen pulled the same trick with Cadillac. During the 1925 court martial of Gen. William Mitchell, the chief prosecutor countered Mitchell’s ridicule of antiquated DH planes as “flaming coffins” by lauding them as “Cadillacs of the skies.” The World War II-era Mustang fighter planes that J. G. Ballard admired as “the Cadillacs of air combat” in his autobiographical novel “Empire of the Sun” were no doubt more worthy of the title.“The Cadillac of such-and-such” became such a popular form of praise in the late ’40s and ’50s that even advertisers of relatively small-ticket items borrowed the brand name to bask in its reflected glory. Hillquist sold “the Cadillac of all trim saws,” a Huffy children’s bicycle was “the Cadillac of the sand-pile set,” Rock-Ola was “the Cadillac of phonographs” and so on. G.M. didn’t object to this appropriation, since it only further boosted the status of the Cadillac brand. After all, according to a 1959 advertisement, Cadillac was “the world’s best synonym for quality.” (To get technical, it’s really a metonym for quality, but that wouldn’t fly in ad copy.)As the years passed, however, the luster began to fade. It was perhaps a bad sign when, in a print ad in 1979, Cadillac felt the need to remind consumers that it was still “the Cadillac of cars.” As the fortunes of Cadillac declined in the ’80s and ’90s, the old laudatory expression became a source of pop-cultural satire: Krusty the Clown on “The Simpsons” endorsed an S.U.V. called the Canyonero as “the Cadillac of automobiles”; the rental-car attendant in the film “Get Shorty” assured John Travolta’s character that the Oldsmobile Silhouette was “the Cadillac of minivans.” Most recently, in the HBO series “The Wire,” when the young female thug Snoop is sold what a salesman calls the Cadillac of nail guns, she dismisses his pitch with the line, “He mean Lexus, but he ain’t know it.”In the health-insurance field, meanwhile, Cadillac had taken hold as an adjective to describe costly coverage that may require little in the way of co-payments or deductibles. As early as May 1964, a Congressional subcommittee heard testimony from a member of the Florida State Council for Senior Citizens that “Cadillac policies” were “driving insurance rates up.” In 1969, the American Federation of Government Employees president John F. Griner told another subcommittee that his group’s members “do not have what we call the Cadillac plans, such as some of the postal organizations have.” The Cadillac modifier came up again in hearings on health care legislation in 1974, when Philip Caper, a doctor and staff member of the Senate Health Subcommittee, asked “whether as a society the provision of ‘Cadillac health care’ for one person and ‘Volkswagen health care’ for another person is acceptable.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','On some level, all stories of successful brands resemble one another: the competitors in some category of good or service seem interchangeable until one of them, often a newcomer, dreams up some way of standing out from the crowd. O.K., maybe it’s not always that simple, but differentiating one choice partly by way of advertising, packaging and other image-enhancing strategies has long been a way of persuading shoppers to reconsider what they had previously seen as a mere commodity. Even, it turns out, bullet shoppers.The ammunition business appears quite healthy these days; there are even reports of shortages attributed to ammo-hoarding by Americans who believe draconian gun restrictions are in the offing. Of course there is more to the bullet market than fear-driven stockpiling. Alliant Techsystems (ATK), a defense contractor, is a leading maker and seller of bullets — to the military mostly, but increasingly to hunters and other civilian gun owners. (In fact, a Business Week article last year suggested that the company is putting even more focus on the latter market in anticipation of slackening military demand.) ATK has been in the consumer-ammunition market for only a few years, but the commercial-products group of its armament-systems division now manages a portfolio of about 20 consumer-ammunition brands. That’s a fair amount of differentiation. Some of the reasons are obvious: the ammunition needs of duck hunters and of pistol-range enthusiasts are quite distinct from each other. But some of ATK’s ammo-brand differentiation sounds more akin to the sort of image making many people associate with, say, energy drinks or deodorants.ATK bought the ammunition-maker Federal Cartridge Company in 2001. That firm’s pricier Federal Premium line had been aimed (as it were) at those willing to pay more for, say, their bonded or all-copper construction; the line had been around since the 1970s and was advertised in hunting magazines and the like with pitches that emphasized function and performance. But outside this high end of the market, “ammunition tended to be a last-minute decision” for most hunters, explains Jason Nash, an ATK communications and events manager. Soon after acquiring Federal, ATK introduced a new bullet line called Fusion, with what Nash calls an “aggressive” box design, including a foil label. Advertising for the brand was intended for 25- to 35-year-old deer hunters — a younger and more mass crowd, in other words. Recently, Fusion signed on Brock Lesnar, a mixed-martial-arts star (and hunting enthusiast) as a celebrity endorser.This experience guided the more recent introduction of the Black Cloud brand of shotgun ammunition, used by duck hunters. Waterfowl hunting laws mandate the use of nontoxic shot, most of which is made from steel, so there’s not much room for differentiation in materials, but Black Cloud does brag about elements of its shell design (notably the “unique and patented” Flitecontrol Wad) and the construction of the shot inside it (Flitestopper Steel, to “devastate waterfowl on impact”). Still, technology by itself is not a marketing strategy.Nowadays there are a lot more options for reaching any given target audience than just hunting magazines. Among other things, Black Cloud forged a partnership with Phil Robertson, “the Duck Commander.” The star of an Outdoor Network show and a series of DVDs, Robertson favors a postapocalyptic ZZ Top aesthetic and relishes duck hunting even in the worst weather imaginable. The company also made “a couple of viral videos” designed to “build buzz,” Nash continues. (These short skitlike bits include a “Webisode” in which the day’s least successful hunter must wear a duck suit and be chased about by retrievers while goofy music plays in the background.) Most recently Black Cloud built a brand-specific social-hub Web site, StormChasersNetwork, which features Robertson, and has signed up 1,200 members in its first month.And then there’s the package design. “If you go into a store like Cabela’s and see a lineup of ammo,” Nash says, “you’ll see that ammunition is kind of treated as a commodity.” Boxes of Black Cloud ($24.99 for 25 shells) dispense with the predictable picture of a mallard for a bright color scheme that “really pops off the shelf,” Nash continues. “You’ve got that emotion of ducks coming in, kind of a daybreak look. If you’re a duck hunter you really identify with first light — that’s when you’re able to start hunting, and there’s a lot of excitement surrounding that moment.”Does that stuff really matter? After all, we’re talking about ammunition, not a lifestyle accessory. Nash thinks it does. Black Cloud is probably ATK’s most fully articulated effort to date to convert an afterthought purchase into a brand that shoppers know about and seek. “We’ve kind of reinvented that category,” Nash argues. Which is almost always how a brand becomes successful, whether it’s an energy drink, a deodorant or steel-shot ammunition.'"
"'09-11-08,'0','Mr. Lagasse, who grew up in Milford, Conn., was just as taken with Ms. Johnson, who is raven-haired and has the skin of Snow White. Alas, she was married, and he was in a relationship. “I knew she was off limits but I could still look at her in meetings,” he said.So they did the next best thing — they became friends. That did not stop Ms. Johnson from running into the bathroom to attend to her lipstick before he arrived. “I just thought he was the greatest,” she said.In early 2007, she decided to file for divorce. She quit her job, too. “I just totally cleaned house,” she said.She invited Mr. Lagasse out for a drink, to tell him her work news, she said, but the conversation quickly turned personal as it was learned, he, too, was newly single.Seven hours later they hugged goodbye, and Ms. Johnson, who was not in the market for a relationship, remembered thinking: “I can’t date him because it’s going to turn into something serious. I was going through a lot of transitions, but I was completely intrigued.”So was Mr. Lagasse. A week later he asked her out on a proper date in Manhattan, during which they drank shots of horseradish vodka and talked endlessly.Fun yes, but were they really compatible? Nancy Janis, a cousin of Mr. Lagasse, described him as “the quintessential abstract random person,” adding, “Someone has to balance the checkbook, and its not him.”So Ms. Johnson and Mr. Lagasse went about testing the other’s mettle.In October 2007, Mr. Lagasse, who regularly traveled to the Nickelodeon networks studios at Disney World in Florida, decided to invite Ms. Johnson along. “I knew Disney World wasn’t something Melissa would normally enjoy,” he said. “She was open-minded and we laughed and it was the best trip ever. What can possibly make Disney World more fun for me? Melissa. I knew right then and there that she was the one.”The general awesomeness of the trip was equally surprising for Ms. Johnson, now the executive in charge of development and production at Perspective Studios, a 3-D and motion-capture animation business, in Glen Cove, N.Y.Still, when Mr. Lagasse professed his love for her in the Magic Kingdom, she couldn’t help blurting out, “You’re telling me that here?” before returning the sentiment.During a trip to Spain that December, she tested him with a spur-of-the-moment side visit to Morocco, during which she refused to set an itinerary or make hotel reservations, and tried to immerse him in the local culture. “I wanted to see if he could travel in the Third World, and he was down with that,” she said.She added, “You can drop him in a room full of hostile people and within two minutes they’re all laughing and deeply enthralled by what he’s saying. He’s a great equalizer. He’s rock solid.”For his part, Mr. Lagasse was happy to have found someone who understood his man-child side. “It was so hard to be myself with many people,” he said. “But Melissa gets it all, the nerd side of me, the comic book side.”In March of this year, on a trek through Green-Wood cemetery — one of their favorite spots in Brooklyn, halfway between their apartments — Mr. Lagasse got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. “He said I cried so hard the tears shot out of my face,” the normally reserved Ms. Johnson said.They were married on Oct. 30 at the Picnic House in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, in a dimly lit room filled with flickering candelabras, Halloween-theme balloons, a smattering of pumpkins and, yes — levitating dessert tables, all of which Mr. Lagasse, whose favorite holiday is Halloween, designed.The costumed guests, which included a Morticia Addams, the Grim Reaper, Marge Simpson and Ms. Janis as the ghost of Anne Boleyn, were treated to a variety show that included puppetry, burlesque and magic.James Godwin, a Universal Life minister, performance artist, painter and puppeteer, officiated at the ceremony, during which the couple slipped on wedding bands and announced, “With this ring, I mark you mine!” They then downed shots of horseradish vodka and smashed a pumpkin to symbolize their union.But the grand finale was a puppet serenade. While Mr. Lagasse played the piano, a “Tim” puppet he had created “serenaded” Ms. Johnson with a heartfelt rendition of Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does it Better.” Guests remarked about the emotional depth of the performances as a “Melissa” puppet — replete with fabric from the bride’s midnight-blue taffeta gown — then joined in for a duet of Harry Nilsson’s “Without You.”“He plays with dolls for a living,” the bride said. “But he’s the most grown-up person I know.”'"
"'09-11-08,'0','EARLY in the first act of the new Broadway revival of the 1998 musical based on E. L. Doctorow’s novel “Ragtime,” arriving immigrants troop through an abstract, high-vaulted structure that evokes Ellis Island. So when it came time to arrange a photo shoot of the creative team behind the show, which opens Nov. 15 at the Neil Simon Theater, the real Ellis Island seemed the logical place to go.Mr. Doctorow was also invited along, and so it was that on Columbus Day he found himself strolling through the hall that offered millions of people their first glimpse of the United States and looking at photographs of people like some of those he portrayed in “Ragtime.” Afterward, at an outdoor cafe that offered a view of the Statue of Liberty, he discussed his novel’s fitful evolution into a Broadway musical.“They’ve constructed a show that is quite loyal to the book and has great integrity,” he said. “The novel, which keeps a certain ironic distance from the characters, is different in tone from the show, where people are openly expressing and singing their feelings. My feeling is that they all thought they were writing a musical, but they ended up with an iconic American opera.”“Ragtime” was originally published in 1975, in the prelude to what Mr. Doctorow called “the self-congratulation” of the Bicentennial, and nowadays is a fixture on college and high school reading lists. Set in the opening years of the last century, it mixed historical figures including J. P. Morgan and Harry Houdini with the interconnected but fictional stories of three very different families: one of prosperous suburban WASPs, another of struggling Jewish immigrants and the last constructed around a black honky-tonk pianist.In 1981 there was a movie version, which Mr. Doctorow considers “rather flatfooted, because it tried to assume that you were watching real life when this is not a realistic novel.” In contrast, the musical, especially the new production, embraces “the fact that you are watching an art object,” he said, and registers not as a period piece but as something contemporary.“It has meanings now that were not apparent in the first version,” Mr. Doctorow said. “It seems to have more relevance today than it did in 1998. It’s more fluent, and probably more exciting.”The show’s director, Marcia Milgrom Dodge, explained that when she was hired last year, the producers told her that she should “make it a ‘Ragtime’ for now.” She took that to mean she needed to preserve the novel’s unblinking portrayal of injustice and social turbulence without losing sight of a certain underlying optimism.“People identify with the timeliness, the idea that America is still the land of dreams,” said Ms. Dodge, who is probably best known for her revamp of “Seussical,” the musical based on the stories of Dr. Seuss. “The sociopolitical themes that run rampant through this story are still happening now. There is still bigotry, and we are in a huge economic disaster. Yet at the same time we are hopeful because we elected a black man as president, and he just won the Nobel Peace Prize.”With so many characters “Ragtime” is an ensemble piece, and in some respects the cast itself also reflects the moment. Stephanie Umoh, who plays Sarah, the role for which Audra McDonald won one of the four Tony Awards that went to the original production, has a father who is an immigrant from Nigeria, a mother from Illinois who is of Irish-German descent, and a soaring, sincere singing style.“It’s so crazy perfect that this show is happening right now,” said Ms. Umoh, who is making her first Broadway appearance at 23 and is barely a year out of college. “It’s not just that it’s the Obama era, but that issues of immigration and race and terrorism are still relevant.”As originally staged in 1998, just before the dot-com bubble burst, “Ragtime” was a lavish $10 million production with a series of dazzling sets and props, including fireworks, and a working Model-T Ford. The new version is more streamlined: it shies away from the ornate in favor of a single all-purpose set that suggests locations as diverse as a tenement and a luxury ocean liner, and it employs the mere framework of a piano and an automobile as symbolic representations of the objects themselves.“When you do a revival, you don’t want to do a reproduction of the original,” said the playwright Terrence McNally, whose adaptation of Mr. Doctorow’s novel also won a Tony. “This is a fresh look at this material. But it’s not a new version in terms of text and score.” The new production of “Ragtime” may still clock in at just short of two and a half hours, but at least 15 minutes have been trimmed from the original version, in part due to the new staging. Much of the rest is what Ms. Dodge calls “judicious nips and tucks” to the Tony Award-winning score, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, and music by Stephen Flaherty, who as a teenager actually played piano in a ragtime band.Unlike some of the adaptations the songwriting team has done in the past, in working from Mr. Doctorow’s novel “the problem is not how to flesh out and make clearer, but how to condense and make clearer,” Ms. Ahrens said. As a result, she added, “everything is compressed, to make it more intimate and powerful.”Bobby Steggert is cast as the younger brother in the WASP family, in Mr. McNally’s estimation, the “essential character in the piece.” Mr. Steggert, 28, recalls seeing the original “Ragtime” from a balcony seat when he was a student at New York University. “I knew the score and loved every bit of it,” he said, “but what I thought was missing was a clearer way to tell the story, and I think that is what we solved.”“ ’Ragtime’ is in the tradition of ‘Showboat’ and ‘South Pacific,’ stories with a lot of plot, a moral fabric to the center of them and a real involvement with the society we live in,” Mr. McNally said. “This is not musical comedy, but we are part of a very long tradition with this show.”'"

"'09-11-09,'1','The Salk Institute scientists — Scott Stewart, Zhi-Yang Tsun and Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte — have now found that dual-purpose switches control many of the 100 or so genes that are activated in the regenerating cells of a zebra fish’s tail. They report their findings in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The switches consist of chemical modifications to the chromatin, the material that wraps and controls access to the DNA of every cell. Genes are most directly controlled through nearby regions of DNA that are themselves turned on by certain regulatory proteins. But a second layer of control is built into the chromatin, which has to unpack itself if the regulatory proteins are to have access to the underlying DNA.Zebra fish tails can be cut off with a razor blade (the fish are anesthetized first). Within 12 hours, genes that are usually silenced throughout the fish’s adult life are turned on.The Salk biologists have found that a key event in this activity is the appearance of an enzyme known as a methylase. The methylase homes in on the chromatin and removes chemical attachments from one half of the dual-purpose switches, and the genes are turned on.The team has shown they can prevent the cut tails from regenerating by giving the fish a drug that inhibits the methylase. Dr. Belmonte said in an interview that he hoped to develop techniques for the opposite process, that of initiating regeneration by turning on the methylase gene.Do people have the same dual-purpose switches built into their genetic circuitry?“It would be wonderful,” Dr. Stewart said, “if we have retained the whole apparatus for regeneration but for the trigger.”One reason for hope is that the genes for embryonic development are very similar in all vertebrates. But in people, a wound prompts the formation of only scar tissue.An approach to regeneration, followed in stem cell research, is to take an embryonic stem cell and try to nudge it down the right paths of development toward a particular kind of adult tissue. Nature, though, seems to do the opposite, starting with adult cells. In the zebra fish, the adult cells at the site of the wound turn into a blastema, a set of cells that have reverted to a stemlike state, and each type of cell then grows and divides to reform the muscles, nerves or skin of the missing tissue. The rationale of nature’s approach is presumably that the adult cells know things, like their proper position and population size in the body, which embryonic cells do not.“Both approaches are valid,” Dr. Stewart said. “Human stem cells are much more in vogue and easier to obtain funding for. But we’ve said, ‘Let’s see how nature does it.’ ”'"

It is the other way around, with grass-fed animals producing up to three times more methane.It may be true that in some trials scientists have found ways to reduce methane emissions from cattle, but until these methods are in widespread use, they are simply not relevant to the consumer choices we face.In any case, globally, only 8 percent of all meat is produced in natural grazing systems, and there is little available unforested land suitable for such systems. To replace factory-farmed meat without further tropical forest destruction is impossible.Hence the call to cut down or eliminate meat-eating, especially beef, should be supported by everyone concerned about the future of our planet.Peter Singer is a professor of bioethics at Princeton University and the author of “The Ethics of What We Eat.” Geoff Russell is the author of “CSIRO Perfidy.” Barry Brook is a professor of climate change at the University of Adelaide, Australia.'"

"'09-11-09,'1','Mr. Suozzi has made a major part of his political brand railing against high property taxes, heading the commission to address them and insisting that he has had success with his part. The county’s share of Nassau taxes has dropped to 16 percent from 23 percent on his watch, while that of the school districts, which he does not control, have risen to 65 percent from 58 percent. But if he loses, it will be in large part because of the anger over high property taxes that led to Republican victories in New Jersey and Westchester County.“I’ve pretty much been a leader of the property tax revolt issue, and now I’m maybe a victim of it,” he said.It’s not that simple. Some fans say Mr. Suozzi is also a victim of running a lousy, complacent campaign and perhaps looking too conspicuously at the next rung on the ladder. And Lawrence Levy, executive director of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, points out that the county gets sales tax revenue that the schools don’t — about $1 billion annually. Still, he said, Mr. Suozzi, who has cut 1,000 county jobs, has largely walked the walk as well as talked the talk, which has its own dangers. “You make enemies when you walk the walk,” Mr. Levy said.Given the volatile vapors out there, Mr. Suozzi seems inclined to up the ante. In an interview on Friday and an op-ed piece in Newsday on Sunday, he said that if voters really wanted to take on property taxes, they should do something radical: Give control of the schools to the county executive instead of maintaining the current system of 56 separate school districts in the county, each with its own well-paid superintendent, administrative staff and the rest.IS this a panacea? Hardly. Mr. Suozzi said his first three property tax proposals would be the county control of schools, legislation forbidding Albany from putting mandates on schools and local governments without identifying needed revenue, and consolidating the state’s 10,000 governments.But the initial response from politicians and school officials to the school proposal was withering, reflecting both the post-election timing and the degree to which it has always been viewed as an interesting idea but political poison.“This is the kind of thing that people have talked about for years, but it’s been a political nonstarter,” Mr. Levy said. “The question is whether people are feeling enough pain that they’re willing to think the unthinkable. I don’t know if we’re at that point, but we’re getting close.”There’s more at play than Mr. Suozzi’s future. The Democrats built their majority in New York when suburbs like Nassau and Westchester went from Republican to Democrat. It’s not clear whether the Democrats have botched it so spectacularly that the suburbs are flipping back, but they’re certainly back in play.As for Mr. Suozzi, he’s almost certainly a diminished character, win or lose.There’s no guarantee he’ll be in office long enough to see if his Hail Mary on the county schools proposal has a chance, but if he has gone out on a limb, it won’t be the first time.“You really need to catch lightning in a bottle right now,” he said, adding, “I’m either going to catch the lightning and get something dramatic done, or I’m going to get electrocuted.”'"
"'09-11-09,'1','Julia Harris, a 27-year-old graduate student living in New York, turned to Rent the Runway when she needed something chic for a fall wedding. For $50, she got a fuchsia Catherine Malandrino number with an elaborately ruffled bust that would have cost $495 to buy.“It was so easy. You just wear it and drop it back in the mail to them,” Ms. Harris said. “I don’t spend $2,000 on a dress regularly, so it’s nice to be able to wear some of the more expensive brands I wouldn’t be able to buy otherwise. And instead of just buying one or two dresses for this season, I can still have a lot of things to wear.”Rent the Runway was founded by two recent Harvard Business School graduates, Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Carter Fleiss. Ms. Hyman said she got the idea for the service last year after watching her younger sister agonize over whether to buy an expensive new outfit to wear to a wedding.“Here was this young girl who loves fashion and was willing to spend a good portion of her salary on a dress that she’s only going to wear once or twice, and I thought, there has to be a solution for this,” said Ms. Hyman.The founders say that more than 20,000 women have signed up for the service, which has been shipping dresses for only a week. Bain Capital Ventures provided seed financing, which the company used to build its inventory of 160 styles.Rent the Runway declined to discuss its business strategy, but it is clear the company faces several risks. Unlike DVDs, fashion changes quickly, and there is no guarantee that the company will be able to rent each dress enough times to cover its costs.In addition, retail stores in major cities have offered dresses for rent for years. Rent the Runway is betting that its shop-by-Web convenience and the appeal of its top-quality fashions will persuade women across the country to rent a dress for a special occasion without trying it on beforehand.The company has also chosen to make the service invitation-only, which gives it an air of exclusivity but may limit its audience.Jeff Roster, an analyst with Gartner, said that execution would be critical. “If my movie doesn’t come on time, I might be mad, but life goes on,” he said. “But if my fancy dress for a big important event doesn’t arrive, that’s a customer service problem like you’ve never had before.”Ms. Hyman and Ms. Carter Fleiss said they had taken several steps to guard against service fiascos. For starters, they use a reservation system to ensure that a customer can get a specific dress for the night she needs it.To assist with fitting, they have on-call stylists who can advise customers on how certain materials feel and how a particular dress might hang on various body types. In addition, the site offers returns within 24 hours for any reason and will include an extra size of a first dress at no additional cost.Customers who want to be extra-safe can choose a second style as a backup, for an additional $25. And all dresses come with a custom garment bag and a “fit kit,” which includes double-sided tape, bra strap adjusters and deodorant stain removers.For fashion designers, the service is a creative marketing strategy and a way to reach a new generation of customers, said Ms. Hyman. “If someone wears a dress and absolutely loves it, she will go out and buy it,” she said.Although most designers are selling their dresses directly to the service, some are providing exclusive runway pieces that are not commercially sold in exchange for a cut of the revenue.Christian Siriano, a New York designer who was the winner in the fourth season of the “Project Runway” reality TV show, said Rent the Runway was a way to introduce his collection to a broader audience.“Even though most people probably know who I am, they don’t know the brand yet,” he said. At a boutique, Mr. Siriano’s pieces can cost as much as $3,000. On Rent the Runway, his styles are offered for $150 to $200.Those prices are especially appealing in a tough economy, said Karen Scheck, president of Lela Rose, a label whose fans include celebrities like .“In challenging economic times, it’s important for brands to reach a larger audience and age demographic that you wouldn’t normally because of the price,” she said. “This is a great way to do it without jeopardizing the brand.”The real test of the service will be the quality of its collection, said Samantha Durbin, editor of FabSugar.com, a fashion blog. “The key is to have really great products that are on trend,” she said. “No one wants to rent last season’s dress.”'"
"'09-11-09,'1','Both bills have passed the House and a Senate subcommittee and await Senate action.Advocates and organizations including the N.A.A.C.P. are lobbying Congress to kill the 1,000-foot provisions. The promise of federal money could not come at a better time, these officials say, as states are cutting their health and human services budgets and private donations are dropping precipitously. At least four needle exchanges have closed this year because of a lack of financing.Many exchanges are run by organizations that provide broad-based health services like testing for the AIDS virus and hepatitis C, mental health counseling, medical referrals and condom distribution. Advocates worry that if needle exchanges disappear, drug users will lose access to those other services.The rule “is going to kill us,” said Ellis Poole, executive director of the Harm Reduction Center of Southern Oregon, which is 997 feet from a high school in Roseburg. The center runs a needle exchange and offers antidrug programs to high schools in the area. With donations plummeting, it has a $374,000 budget deficit for 2009. Mr. Poole said he worried that the center’s programs would be threatened if the bill passed.“We could move a few feet down, but the building is more expensive at the other end,” Mr. Poole said. “I have to beg for money for computers. I have to ask people to come clean the carpet at no charge.”Officials at exchanges in cities like Chicago, New York and Washington say there are few, if any, places that could house a needle exchange under the rule.“I was thinking, ‘A thousand feet, how much is that?’ ” said Raquel Algarin, executive director of the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center in Manhattan. “And then I found myself thinking, ‘We’d probably be doing syringe exchange in the middle of the East River, and any exchange on the West Side would be in the Hudson River.’ How do you work that out?”Many advocates also worry that smaller, rural exchanges, which lack the fund-raising abilities and infrastructure of many larger, urban exchanges, will be affected by the 1,000-foot rule.In Maine, which officials say has one of the highest rates of prescription drug abuse per capita in the country and is grappling with a recent influx of heroin, AIDS activists worry that they will receive less money just as their client base is growing. The state’s four exchanges — in Augusta, Bangor, Ellsworth and Portland — would be ineligible for federal money.“The federal funding would be key for us,” said Patricia A. Murphy, executive director of the Eastern Maine AIDS Network in downtown Bangor.Upon entering the office, squeezed between a veterans center and a music store, drug users are escorted into a small room, where a trained staff member checks them in, using only first names and case numbers, and carefully counts their needles.Under Maine law, drug users may receive one clean needle for every dirty one they turn in. The exchange offers users a variety of needle sizes, along with tourniquets, antiseptic ointment, condoms and information on safe needle use, and helps refer clients to clinics and treatment centers that deal with sexually transmitted diseases. The center also has a food bank, which clients are urged to use.Those who have built a level of trust with Ms. Murphy and her staff send fellow drug users to the office. The number of users enrolled in the needle exchange here has doubled in the past year, while funding fell by about 15 percent.The federal money, Ms. Murphy said, would allow the exchange to grow with the number of clients, many of whom come from rural northern and eastern Maine, and set up mobile needle exchange units in communities more than 100 miles from Bangor.“This is a critical piece of harm reduction,” Ms. Murphy said.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, intravenous drug use directly or indirectly accounts for about one-fifth of the nation’s 1.1 million H.I.V. cases, and needle exchanges are an effective way to stem the spread of infection. The World Health Organization said in a 2004 report that there was “compelling evidence” that increasing needle exchanges reduced H.I.V. transmission. It cited studies showing that the rate of infection dropped up to 18 percent in cities with an exchange.Luke, a 30-year-old Bangor resident who did not want to give his last name, said he exchanged his needles, and sometimes those of his friends, about once a week. He said he had become addicted to Suboxone, a drug intended to treat opiate addiction that officials say more people are starting to abuse.In a black hooded sweatshirt and red sneakers, Luke said he often also picked up condoms and guides on how to inject drugs more safely. He said he came to the facility because its location made it discreet and few people knew what it was.A 23-year-old man who is addicted to heroin and exchanges needles at the Down East AIDS Network in Ellsworth called the 1,000-foot limit “ridiculous.” The man, who did not want to give his name because of his addiction, said he started using heroin eight years ago and exchanging needles four years ago. He said he often picked up needles he saw on the ground and brought them in for safe disposal.“It’s a dangerous thing to do,” the man said of his heroin use, “but it’s best to take every precaution you can. If you’re going to do this stuff, you should do it right.”'"
"'09-11-09,'1','Morgan Freeman, below, has reached an out-of-court settlement with his passenger over a lawsuit revolving around an August 2008 single-car crash, Reuters reported. Mr. Freeman was driving Demaris Meyer to his home near Charleston, Miss., when the car, a 1997 Nissan Maxima owned by Ms. Meyer, swerved off the road and flipped several times. Mr. Freeman was taken to the hospital, and Ms. Meyer later sued, accusing him of failure to operate a car properly. A spokesman for Mr. Freeman said no further details on the settlement would be given, and court records were not made public, Reuters reported, but Ms. Meyer’s lawyer said she was “pleased that the matter is resolved and the case is settled.” At the time of the accident, Sgt. Ben Williams, a Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman, said there was no indication that alcohol or drugs contributed to the crash.'"
"'09-11-09,'1','The circle expands. Dancers leave. Light changes. Dancers, returning, meet in twos and threes and pass one another. We might be watching molecular formations. Explosive jumps pivot in midair; the climax of a leap often occurs as a dancer turns to face his own leg.Suddenly one man, James Samson, is alone, as Debussy’s second section, “Jimbo’s Lullaby,” commences. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Samson must enjoy the Jimbo/James pun here. Debussy is thought to have confused “Jimbo” with “Jumbo,” since his music has a quality of elephantine grace, but that too is perfect, for James/Jimbo/Jumbo Samson is the tallest, broadest and most seemingly innocent man in the Taylor company. The choreography shows the sumptuous lyricism he brings to a surprising array of movements: taking a raised knee in both hands and pushing it to the floor; placing both hands and one foot on the floor and extending the other leg into the air; a softly powerful run.Now he’s joined by Julie Tice, to whom Mr. Taylor gives the work’s most immediately startling moment. Without ado she kneels, stretches back in ardent abandon and opens her upper body to Mr. Samson. Yet he just watches at a distance, as if such behavior were new, and he was unsure of his own feeling.Debussy’s third item, “Serenade for the Doll,” becomes, at its climax in Mr. Taylor’s setting, a little drama of narcissism. Amy Young dances with a hand mirror. Even when she’s with Sean Mahoney, she is as rapt by her reflection as by him. This leads to a note of bitterness, even a fleeting hint of self-flagellation; the mirror is hurled away.“The Snow Is Dancing” (Debussy’s title) is all female, characterized by some of Mr. Taylor’s most wonderful use of déhanchement: placing all the body’s weight on one hip (introduced by Polyclitus into Greek sculpture, beautifully discussed by Kenneth Clark in “The Nude” but employed sparingly by almost every other Western choreographer). One woman after another is awoken until five women are all dancing together. Suddenly six men chase after them.Michael Trusnovec is alone when “The Little Shepherd” starts. He dances a solo in which adagio and allegro features are rivetingly combined, and then Ms. Tice enters and promptly repeats that kneeling backbend of inviting abandon that she addressed earlier to Mr. Samson. But unlike Mr. Samson, Mr. Trusnovec responds, at once taking her in a dance that suggests coupling.Soon Mr. Mahoney joins them. Jealousy is suggested. But what kind? The two men are left together. Is what they do rivalry? Or intimacy? Everything is fleeting. Mr. Taylor’s strokes are all economically ambiguous.Other male-female liaisons quickly come and go, and now the finale, “Golliwog’s Cakewalk.” All the dancers are lined up in a bright march, but this too melts — like the music, which quotes Wagner’s “Tristan” and then laughs it off — into encounters more intimate or aggressive.I wanted “Brief Encounters” to last twice as long; certainly I am impatient to see it a second time. (It will be performed as part of an American tour and in the company’s City Center season next year.) James F. Ingalls lights the dancers now from above, from sideways, from behind, so that the stage world keeps changing drastically. At Syracuse, because it followed the hilarious “Also Playing” (Mr. Taylor’s other 2009 creation), the audience was quick to discover the comic aspects. Other programming could reveal more of its pain and desire.“Brief Encounters” is an essay in the very stuff of theater poetry. Its kaleidoscopic succession of part-dramatic imagery seems often to touch — lightly but keenly — on some of the most ineffable aspects of the ways dance can illuminate musical expression. What Debussy designated as nursery music here depicts a more adult innocence. Every emotion and meeting seems young, pristine, mysterious.'"

You just say the word leukemia, you’ve got reason to be scared.”Abdul-Jabbar learned last December that he has chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow in which the body produces cancerous white blood cells. Chronic describes a relatively slow-growing cancer that may take years to progress. Myeloid refers to the type of white blood cell being overproduced.“It’s been almost a year now since I’ve been diagnosed,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “My first reaction was to deal with it, make that fight for my life.”Like many patients found to have this particular strain of leukemia, Abdul-Jabbar learned he had the disease while it was in its early phase.“In order to really deal with this situation, you have to find a specialist and follow their instructions,” he said. “You have to take your medication; you have to get your blood checked regularly so that you can be monitored.”For the last 11 months he has kept a brisk regimen: coaching with the , completing a documentary about the all-black Rens teams and writing a children’s book.“It’s something that can be managed,” he said of his disease. “You can continue to live a productive life without changing your lifestyle that much. It does not have to be a death sentence.”Why would someone who has been so fiercely private be so public about such a personal issue? Over the years Abdul-Jabbar has been one of the most intriguing athletes: a champion and, after the cheering stopped, a scholar and intellectual. He has written several best-selling history books, and is completing a documentary film. His seventh book is scheduled to be published in 2011.Through all his accomplishments — at Power Memorial High School and and with the and the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar has kept largely to himself. So why such a public disclosure?“I think that someone like me, who has a public presence, because people pay attention to what’s going on in my life, can help save some lives,” he said. “I want to get the message across: this condition is treatable. I want to get people to go to doctors, take the medication. This disease can be managed and you can continue to live a very meaningful life.”A related objective is to encourage people, especially men, to take better care of themselves. This means making more frequent trips to the doctor for checkups.“You’ve got to be proactive about your health,” he said. “You can’t just sit back. If I can affect that condition, I’m a very happy guy.”Why is it that the illness of a great athlete is so disconcerting, be it or Ernie Davis? Perhaps because those of us who spend so much time in sports live in a cocoon of healthy, young bodies where fatal illness is rare and injuries are simply part of the landscape.“I’ve been a student of the martial arts my whole life,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “The whole idea of facing death calmly and doing all you can with your life up to that moment and to keep your objectives — that’s been the part of this that has made me.”In his sport and in his day, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was a true King of the Hill. Two decades after his , he still holds the N.B.A. career scoring record. The diagnosis of leukemia is one more mountain to climb, one more season to negotiate.“I’m going to be able to do the things that I love to do,” he said. “Deal with my children, write, coach. I can still live a meaningful life and manage this disease.“I’m going to continue being me. I can’t stop doing that.”'"
"'09-11-10,'1','In 1965, Congress came up with an elegant idea: Use some of the royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to buy and conserve open space threatened by development. The dollars raised from depleting one natural resource would be used to protect another. Since then, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has invested more than $13 billion and added more than five million acres to the national parks, wildlife refuges and national forests.Beginning in 1977, Congress annually authorized a spending level of $900 million (from a much larger royalty pool, which now totals $12 billion). But because Congress routinely diverted much of the money to the Treasury for deficit reduction, actual appropriations have been far less. In President George W. Bush’s last year, only $155 million was appropriated for the fund.President Obama promised more than $400 million this year and the full $900 million in 2015. Senators Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Max Baucus of Montana have a better idea. Last week, they introduced a bill that would guarantee financing of $900 million every year, beginning with the next fiscal year, and would insulate the fund from future raids. Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia is promoting the same idea in the House.There is plenty of evidence that, even in the midst of a recession, Americans are willing to spend money to protect open space. According to a tally by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, a conservation group, voters approved two out of three open space bond issues across 11 states last week, including a $400 million “Green Acres” measure in New Jersey.More federal dollars are needed to help complete long-pending acquisitions from Hawaii to Yellowstone National Park to the Everglades. The money would also help hard-pressed states, like New York, whose own land conservation program has been severely squeezed by huge budget shortfalls.A guaranteed source of revenue for land and water conservation is something the original architects of the fund had in mind. It’s past time for Congress to honor their wish.'"
"'09-11-10,'1','SEOUL, South Korea  Naval patrol boats of North and South Korea exchanged fire in disputed waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday, the South Korean military said.“Our high-speed patrol boat repelled the North Korean patrol boat,” the South Korean Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. “We are fully prepared for further provocations from the North Korean military.”The skirmish Tuesday preceded by only a few days President Obama’s scheduled departure on a trip to Asia, which includes a stop in Seoul and a meeting with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea next week.North Korea’s nuclear program is likely to be a prominent topic of the American president’s talks here and elsewhere.The damaged patrol boat retreated to North Korea, according to the news agency Yonhap, which quoted an anonymous government source in Seoul.There were no South Korean casualties, Yonhap reported.There was no immediate announcement from North Korea, and it was not clear whether there were any North Korean casualties.The fighting on Tuesday erupted when a North Korean patrol boat sailed across the so-called northern limit line, a sea border drawn by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War in 1953 but never accepted by North Korea.The South Koreans first issued warning broadcasts, according to the military, and when these were ignored, they fired warning shots.“It was then that the North Korean patrol boat attacked our high-speed patrol boat,” the statement said. “Our ship returned the fire.”Nine South Korean fishing boats were in the vicinity but were safely evacuated, Yonhap reported.The fighting took place in a sea near Daecheong-do, an island, controlled by South Korea, that is about 125 miles west of Seoul and about 20 miles off the North Korean coast.The water remains the most volatile section of the Korean border, with North Korea regularly warning that a confrontation there could ignite a full-blown war. The two navies engaged in bloody skirmishes in the disputed waters in 1999 and 2002.In 1999, two North Korean warships were sunk, with an unknown number of casualties, and seven South Korean sailors were injured.In 2002, one South Korean patrol boat was sunk and six South Korean sailors were killed.'"
"'09-11-10,'1','“The moment they came, I said, ‘We’re never going to forget about Mommy,’ ” Ms. Fields said. “Sometimes Tichina comes back and wants to talk, so we have our moment and we talk. I tell her it’s O.K. to cry.”But lack of space is a major hindrance. Johnathon, Justin and Jasmyn share a bedroom, alternating between bunk beds and a mattress on the floor, and Tichina and Christopher sleep on the couch.“We can’t even sit at the dinner table together like most families — we have to eat separately,” Ms. Fields said.A multitasker who is rarely without her Bluetooth earpiece, Ms. Fields makes $45,000 a year as a station agent for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Christopher receives $697 a month from Supplemental Security Income. While the family receives $334 in food stamps every month, rent is $660, cable and Internet service is $210, and Ms. Fields pays $308 a month to store her niece and nephew’s beds and other possessions they could not part with. Mr. Smith, who is unemployed, does not contribute financially but helps out around the house, Ms. Fields said.In lieu of gainful employment, Johnathon takes care of the brood in the afternoons and evenings, when Ms. Fields is at work. It is often there, in the booth, where her sorrows catch up with her: Her mother died four months after her sister, and she lost her brother, Samuel, in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.“In this family, we’ve had our share of tragedies,” she said. “I cry and sell the MetroCards at the same time. I wipe away tears. You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do.”Last January, a social worker from the Children’s Aid Society, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, approached Tichina at Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School, where the charity provides on-site services, and offered help in the wake of her mother’s death. Ms. Fields received $500 in gift cards from Old Navy, Modell’s and Pathmark, enabling her to buy clothes for the children and stock the refrigerator with food.“Trust me, it came in handy,” Ms. Fields said. “When they handed me the gift cards, I burst out in tears. You don’t think people care about your situation. But when life throws you lemons, you make lemonade. You move on.”'"
"'09-11-10,'1','If you went to Le Poisson Rouge on Sunday evening to hear the Grand Valley State University New Music Ensemble, of Michigan, perform music from its new recording, “In C Remixed,” you got either more or less than you bargained for, depending on your point of view. The recording, a two-CD set, includes 18 reconsiderations of Terry Riley’s classic Minimalist score, “In C” (1964), by 16 composers, as well as a 20-minute performance of the work itself. Among the selections are new works built on allusions to “In C” and remixes, radically reconfigured, edited and electronically altered versions of the Riley work.When the ensemble and its director, Bill Ryan, undertook the project, they hoped to perform these works in concert. But the electronic remix aspect made that too complicated. Then they engaged one of the remixers, the composer Dennis DeSantis, to create a “live remix,” with the ensemble playing “In C” and Mr. DeSantis playing a mixing board and sound-processing equipment, altering the balances and timbres of the live instruments.At a rehearsal, that recourse proved unsatisfactory as well. So what Mr. Ryan, Mr. DeSantis and the group’s 15 musicians did was play “In C,” with Mr. DeSantis contributing the pulse and electronic versions of some of the score’s 53 melodic cells. While you got neither the 18 derivative works nor any live remixing, the version of “In C” they played on Sunday clocked in at about an hour, three times as long as the account on the recording.As its length suggests, this was a leisurely “In C,” and it began with a prelude of sorts: a rich aural haze surrounding a honking, spirited saxophone line that darted about for five minutes before the steady, pulsing C signaled the start of Mr. Riley’s work. The ensemble, which included standard strings and woodwinds, as well as a few guitars, an accordion, a piano and percussion, moved between extremes of dense, flowing textures and transparent pointillism, with Mr. DeSantis’s additions — including what sounded like instrumental sounds played backward — occasionally providing otherworldly effects.By design, “In C” sounds different in every performance, and this was as good a reading as many, but not the best I’ve heard: that distinction is still held by the vigorous Darmstadt performance at Galapagos in 2007.The composer-performers Todd Reynolds and Michael Lowenstern, who both contributed works to the Grand Valley State University New Music Ensemble’s “In C Remixed” recording, opened the concert with a handful of the pieces they have recorded together as the Slow Boys, a violin and bass clarinet duo (with ample electronic support). Mr. Reynolds’s violin lines are bluesy and freewheeling, and Mr. Lowenstern’s bass clarinet figures have a magnificent, bottom-crawling spirit that gives the music a punchy, often jazzy texture.'"
"'09-11-10,'1','LONDON — Many senior banking executives failed to accept responsibility for the financial crisis and neglected the need to change their behavior, Hector Sants, the chief executive at Britain’s financial industry regulatory body, said Monday.Mr. Sants said that senior executives should be responsible for creating a company culture that provides a strong ethical framework. He also said they should help avoid excessive risk-taking and other inappropriate behavior that could lead to another financial crisis. The regulator, the Financial Services Authority, plans to intervene when a lender creates a bad corporate culture, he said.“There remains, I believe, an absence of the acceptance of collective responsibility for what has happened,” Mr. Sants said in a speech in London on Monday. He said he remained “unconvinced that all senior management have taken on board the need to change and operate in a genuinely different manner.”A handful of banking executives have defended their industry over the last month, saying that there was nothing “immoral” or “evil” about large banks or making money. They countered growing public anger over many banks preparing giant bonus payments just a year after governments around the world had to step in with multibillion-dollar bailouts to rescue the sector.Mr. Sants said the British regulator had already started to force applicants for senior banking jobs to undergo a much stricter interview process. “A number of applicants have withdrawn as a result,” he said. Executives would be tested for their ability to “set a strong ethical framework and to foster the right culture” by evaluating how they treat their customers and how they behave in the marketplace.“Our aim would therefore be to seek to facilitate the creation of good cultures and intervene when bad ones seem to be creating unacceptable outcomes,” he said.'"
"'09-11-10,'1','To enhance the feeling of being in the same room, the other half of the table appears on screen, participants’ eyes are at the same level and the walls are even painted the same color.“With telepresence, you really feel like you can look people in the eye and get a real sense of what they’re about,” said Richard Redelfs, a general partner with Foundation Capital, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has rented suites at a nearby Cisco Systems office to meet virtually with entrepreneurs in India.“I’m a people person and that’s the nature of the venture business, so I was a little skeptical about the experience,” Mr. Redelfs said. “But it’s amazing. There’s no latency in the system — when you say something you get an immediate response. Psychologically, you really start behaving like you’re face to face.”Although the company does not use telepresence often enough to buy its own suite, which can cost $200,000 plus charges for network services and support, renting one has turned out to be an efficient and economical way for all nine partners to size up the founders of far-flung start-ups before deciding on an investment. (A few partners still make the trip to meet in person before anyone writes a check.)That is precisely the type of business Starwood and Marriott are hoping to capture, along with revenue from customers who travel to metropolitan markets to use the telepresence suites for recruiting interviews, legal depositions and other small meetings.“There’s an opportunity for us not just to host a meeting but also to host room nights for people traveling to those hubs,” said Mary Casey, a vice president at Starwood, which plans to have at least two telepresence suites open by the end of the year, with more following in 2010.Starwood locations in development include hotels in New York, Sydney, Toronto, Los Angeles and Chicago, while Marriott plans to open its first telepresence suite at the New York Marriott East Side in December, followed by hotels in San Francisco and Bethesda, Md.Both hotel companies are working with Cisco, a leader in telepresence technology, with about 3,100 of its suites installed by customers worldwide.There are other providers as well, among them Polycom, Teliris, Hewlett-Packard and Tandberg (which Cisco is seeking to acquire). And one of the challenges has been to link the technology of those various systems and getting network providers to talk to each other. Cisco, for instance, works with Tata Communications at Starwood’s properties and the Taj Boston hotel and has worked with AT&T at the Marriott hotels. “You’ve got to make it possible for all these various networks to hook up to each other,” said Scott Morrison, a vice president with the technology research company Gartner. “That will help grow the demand for these rooms.”The telepresence providers are also seeking to expand the number of suites by introducing more that can be rented by the public.“The value goes up every time somebody else gets connected,” said David Hsieh, a marketing vice president with Cisco, which hopes to have 50 public suites open by early next year.In fact, some companies that have telepresence technology are incorporating it into their travel booking systems, Mr. Morrison said, so employees consider it as a choice in lieu of taking a trip.Seizing on that trend, travel companies like American Express and Carlson Wagonlit Travel plan to help clients weigh whether to use a telepresence suite and then to reserve a room. The move is meant to expand, not chip away at, their core travel booking business.“Travel is about connecting people with each other, and traditionally that means putting people on planes, on trains and in automobiles, but the recession has changed that environment considerably,” said Alicia Tillman, a vice president with American Express.“Offering telepresence as a different option to still connect people with each other is a method that we fully expect our client companies are going to adopt and embrace.”'"
"'09-11-10,'1','Another home magazine has been demolished.Metropolitan Home will cease publication with its December issue, Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. said on Monday.It is one of several home magazines to be eliminated in the last two years, given the bad housing market and lack of disposable income for redecorating.They include Domino and House and Garden from Condé Nast; Southern Accents, Cottage Living and InStyle Home from Time Inc.; Blueprint from Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia; O at Home from Hearst; and Country Home from Meredith.Published regularly as Apartment Life in 1974, Metropolitan Home became known for its features on renovations and its focus on everyday homes rather than the houses of celebrities or architects, making it a more accessible predecessor to magazines like Domino. It had a circulation of about 560,000 in the first six months of this year, which was about 10,000 more copies than it had promised to advertisers, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.Its ad pages from July to September fell 35.7 percent, to 127.4 pages, from the same period a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. That drop was around the same as Gourmet’s; Condé Nast recently closed that magazine.Hachette also publishes Elle Decor and said it would focus its efforts on that magazine. Elle Decor is faring worse in terms of overall ad pages in the third quarter. They fell 46.9 percent, to 123.2 pages, from the same period a year earlier.'"

"'09-11-11,'1','Dr. Cohn achieved success only after repeatedly encountering prejudice, from the college professor who told her that being a chemist would not be “ladylike,” to chemical company recruiters who explicitly refused to interview women or Jews, to university departments that would not allow a woman on the track to be a tenured professor. She had to wait 21 years after receiving her Ph.D. to receive her first tenure-track appointment.Dr. Cohn eventually became the first woman appointed to the editorial board of The Journal of Biological Chemistry and the first woman to become president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.A biography prepared by Washington University in St. Louis, one of the institutions where Dr. Cohn taught and researched, said she had worked in laboratories or written papers with six Nobel laureates. She wrote 160 published papers in all.Mildred Cohn was born on July 12, 1913, in New York City to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father was a tailor who invented a machine for cutting cloth more accurately.She graduated from high school at 14 and moved on to Hunter College, then an all-women’s school, where she majored in chemistry, minored in physics and graduated at 17. The teacher who advised her against being a research chemist urged her to become a chemistry teacher instead.Afterward, she enrolled in Columbia University’s doctoral program, only to find that she would not be accepted as a teaching assistant because the position was reserved for men. She earned a master’s degree.She then took a research job at a NASA forerunner, where she was the only woman who worked on a project with 70 men to develop fuel-injection airplane engines. Though she was able to publish two papers there, one as senior author, she left when told that she would not be promoted.She then returned to Columbia, where she worked on the team of Harold C. Urey, a Nobel laureate, and earned her Ph.D. She studied ways of using the different weights of carbon and other atoms to trace the atoms’ movement in cells.Dr. Urey helped her join the research team of Vincent du Vigneaud, a biochemistry professor at George Washington University Medical School. There she helped develop methods of tracing isotopes as they move through bodily processes. The tracing methods opened the way for much broader medical research at the molecular level.In 1946, her husband, Dr. Henry Primakoff, a physicist, joined the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Cohn accepted a research position there with the husband-and-wife team of Carl and Gerty Cori, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1947.Dr. Cohn went to Penn in 1960 and became a full professor the next year. In 1964, the American Heart Association chose her to be a career investigator, making her the first woman to hold the position. She did so for 14 years.Dr. Cohn was also the Benjamin Rush professor of physiological chemistry at Penn and a senior scientist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She retired in 1985, but continued working in her lab at Penn.At Washington and at Penn, her research contributed to the understanding of the structure of ATP, a molecule that stores energy for cellular functions. The growing body of knowledge about ATP has had an impact on fields including neuroscience and biotechnology.Dr. Primakoff, her husband, died in 1983. Dr. Cohn is survived by her daughters, Nina Rossomando and Laura Primakoff; her son, Paul; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.The Women’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., inducted Dr. Cohn the day after she died. She had learned beforehand that she would receive the honor.“When I saw that Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey were also members,” she said in an interview with ASBMB, the magazine of the biochemistry society, “I decided this could be a good place for me.”'"

"'09-11-11,'1','Some of the great names in postwar and contemporary art were solid sellers at Christie’s on Tuesday night. And while American collectors were back, dominating the bidding, price mattered. Only one work — a 1996 painting by the Scottish artist Peter Doig — broke the $10 million barrier in a mixed sale that included property once belonging to Merce Cunningham, the dancer and choreographer, and his partner in life and work, the composer John Cage.It was an event that drew crowds. Some collectors could be spotted in the front row of Christie’s Rockefeller Center salesroom, including Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent, and Laurence Graff, the London jeweler. Secreted in a skybox was Mr. Doig, who came to see how his painting fared.On Tuesday night, the artist’s “Reflection (What Does Your Soul Look Like),” a dreamy canvas of a man’s reflection in a pond, was estimated at $4 million to $6 million. When the bidding rose to $8.6 million, with four tenacious collectors still in the running, Christopher Burge, the auctioneer, patiently said, “I can stay here all night.”It looked as if he was going to. After the hammer fell, at $9 million, or $10.1 million with fees, one bidder decided he wanted to go on after all. But it was too late. Marc Porter, Christie’s president in America, took the winning bid by telephone on behalf of a collector he refused to identify.It was a sale with high-profile sellers like Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate, who is in the midst of a much-publicized divorce. He was parting with several pricey works, but none sold. Basquiat’s epic 1983 “Brother Sausage,” a six-panel painting, had no takers. It had been estimated at $9 million to $12 million.'"

The health disparities policy is based on evidence showing that married couples are more likely to have health insurance.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','Even before the shootings, Mr. Shinseki was in a rush, telling people he figured he would have three years — the average tenure of a cabinet secretary, he says — to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs.In nine months, he has pushed the department to make it easier for veterans to receive compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder. The agency has expanded the list of illnesses presumed to have been caused by Agent Orange, smoothing the way for an estimated 200,000 Vietnam-era veterans to receive benefits. And he has requested what would be the largest single-year increase in the department’s budget in three decades, $15 billion, or 16 percent.Mr. Shinseki has also pledged to streamline the backlog-plagued disability compensation system and is pushing to revamp an archaic computer system so electronic records track a veteran from enlistment to death.Perhaps most ambitious is his goal of getting 131,000 homeless veterans off the street in six years. “I don’t think you can do this sort of thing if you don’t put a big number on the table,” he said.But as much as anything, Mr. Shinseki talks about bringing “a change of culture” to the department. Widely viewed as indifferent or obstructionist by veterans’ groups, it needs to become more of an advocate for the people it serves, Mr. Shinseki says.“I think what’s important for me is to make sure we aren’t seen as adversarial,” he said.Veterans advocates who describe the department as a bastion of antiquated technology and hostile paper pushers, say he will need to do that and more to improve the sprawling agency, the government’s second largest after Defense.“He faces one of the greatest rebranding challenges in American government,” said Paul Rieckhoff, an Iraq veteran and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “When I came home, my father, a Vietnam-era vet, said: ‘Don’t go to V.A. I wouldn’t go unless I was on fire.’ ”The problems are daunting. Nearly 8 million of the 23.4 million veterans are enrolled in the veterans system, which administers compensation for disabled veterans and runs the nation’s largest health care system.And the numbers are growing, partly because of the two wars, partly because of the recession, partly because the department has expanded certain programs and partly because it has reinstated benefits for hundreds of thousands of veterans who lost them several years ago.At the same time, the department is widely criticized as inefficient or incompetent. Thousands of veterans have reported records being lost or destroyed. Applicants for compensation wait months for claims to be processed and years more for appeals to be adjudicated. And although the health care system is widely praised, it has had its share of scandals, including botched prostate surgeries and improperly cleaned colonoscopy equipment.“They can’t do it the way they’ve done it in the past,” said Bob Wallace, executive director of the Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. “It won’t work.”Mr. Shinseki, who grew up in Hawaii, the grandson of Japanese immigrants, has been in this kind of rush before. When he became the Army chief of staff in 1999, he pushed hard to modernize his hidebound service to prepare for new kinds of warfare.Over protests, he ordered active-duty soldiers to wear black berets — once worn only by elite Army Rangers — as a symbol of unity and excellence. He also championed a lighter, eight-wheeled armored vehicle called the Stryker that is now in used in Afghanistan.“If you don’t like change, you are going to like irrelevance even less,” General Shinseki was fond of telling his commanders. (He has resurrected the line.)He became perhaps better known for running afoul of Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense in the Bush administration, when he said, on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that far more troops would be needed to secure the country. He was marginalized by the Pentagon leadership, but time proved him right.Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said Mr. Shinseki has been pleasantly open about missteps, as when the administration proposed passing on some health care costs to veterans. There was an outcry among veterans, and Mr. Shinseki helped kill the proposal.Later, when the agency was slow to send checks to veterans attending college on the post-9/11 G.I. bill, Mr. Shinseki ordered offices to open on a Saturday to issue payments to eligible students.“Before, they would have said, tough, live with it,” Ms. Murray said.But amid the plaudits, some advocates wonder how well a general can run a bureaucracy filled with unionized civil servants. He can hire and fire at will only a few dozen of the department’s 298,000 employees. And some friends worry whether Mr. Shinseki, famously plainspoken and earnest, can survive in sharp-elbowed Washington.“He’s less likely to shape things to be palatable,” said Maj. Gen. Eric Olson, who is retired and served three times under Mr. Shinseki. “He’s more likely to go in and say: ‘This isn’t right, this isn’t how things should be done. Why can’t we fix it?’ And that’s not always the way to get things done in Washington.”Mr. Shinseki acknowledged that he does not always know what works best in Washington. But in his four years as Army chief, he said, “I got enough done without having to do something unnatural for me. I think what’s natural for me is trying to tell the story that soldiers need told. It’s not my story, it’s their story.”He suggests that he was as surprised as anyone when Mr. Obama, whom he had never met before the election, asked him to join the cabinet.When friends express skepticism about whether he is enjoying his job, he says he tells them: “I get up every day and look forward to coming to work. The day isn’t long enough to solve the problems. I wish it was longer because there is lots to do.”'"
"'09-11-11,'1','Two United Nations foreign missions received envelopes containing white powder on Tuesday, a day after three others received mailings containing a similar substance that the police said was determined to be flour.Initial tests of the powder found in the envelopes delivered on Tuesday did not show the presence of anthrax spores or any other hazardous substance, the police said. They said the powder was sent to a laboratory for more conclusive testing.The envelopes delivered on Tuesday were opened at the missions of the United Kingdom and Germany, near the United Nations headquarters, the police said. They said a note inside the envelope at the German Mission read “Al Qaeda F.B.I. in America.” It was similar to notes found in envelopes received on Monday at the Uzbek and Austrian Missions, the police said.Two security workers were exposed to the letter at the United Kingdom Mission, at 885 Second Avenue, before they sealed it in a biohazard container, the police said. A 46-year-old woman was exposed to the letter at the German Mission, at United Nations Plaza, they said, adding that those exposed underwent a procedure to remove the power.On Monday, letters containing white powder were opened at the missions of France, Uzbekistan and Austria, the police said. On Tuesday night, they said that the substance found in those letters had been determined to be flour.The two letters delivered on Tuesday were postmarked from a processing center in suburban Dallas, the police said, and the three received on Monday were postmarked from Dallas. Investigators planned to test the envelopes for DNA.'"

On Tuesday, the top executive of and said the companies would begin selling a small car in in 2012 that would cost less than any other car sold in the country — and thus the world.The car, which is to be manufactured by the Indian scooter and rickshaw company Bajaj Auto, is Renault and Nissan’s answer to the Nano, which , India’s largest auto company, started selling this year for as little as $2,500.Auto companies are increasingly turning their attention to emerging markets like India because car sales are stagnant or declining in developed markets in and .and have also said they intend to sell ultralow-cost small cars in India.But the small-car efforts face significant challenges. Tata, for instance, has delivered just 10,500 Nanos since the car hit Indian roads in July. And Renault, Nissan and Bajaj Auto had first hoped to deliver their car in 2011., the chief executive of Renault and Nissan, would not say exactly how much the car would cost but said it would be less expensive than any other now available as well as more than its competitors. He added that, depending on how competitors priced their cars, the new car might not be the least expensive available when it went on sale.The company announced plans for the car last year, but the effort to develop it has progressed more slowly than expected. Mr. Ghosn said the delay was not surprising, given that none of the three participants had ever made such a vehicle. Bajaj Auto has traditionally made two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and most Renault and Nissan cars are bigger and more expensive than the most popular Indian cars.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','You know what’s going to be great? When Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli finally open the main dining room of Prime Meats, their excellent little barroom in Carroll Gardens.These are some talented bears. Their flagship up the block, Frankies 457 Spuntino, barely has a kitchen, but you could spend a happy year at the bar there eating meatballs and flirting with the servers; you could do the same in Frankies 17 Spuntino on the Lower East Side, taking breaks only for bites of slow-roasted rib-eye or pork braciola.Prime Meats, long and lean at present, with soaped windows next door representing the future, is a happy extension of their brand — Italian grandma cooking under Edison light bulbs, basically, with salvaged wood tables, white tiles, old glass — into more northern European precincts.The menu is currently small. But it delivers. Sautéed wild mushrooms with a poached Amish egg, for instance ($10), are delicious at breakfast and dinner alike, and if a Roman Catholic egg might be slightly better than the Amish (who knows?), the mushrooms are deep with the perfection of the forest floor, and the egg, no matter its heritage, is sweet and fresh atop it.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','In that room, in the restaurant’s early days, you could find a terrific hunk of Alaskan halibut served with baby carrots, fresh garbanzo beans, preserved lemon and a saffron-hued mussel sauce. There was also a rich and quintessentially Palmer pairing of lobster tail and pork belly, the two fatties squaring off over summer squash and chanterelles, with gooseberries set against the fragrance of almonds and wine.An appetizer of pan-roasted shrimp with cauliflower, segments of blood orange, pickled ramps and curry butter arrived on the table extremely sweet and clean, with a mild bite from the curry. A main course of Colorado lamb loin with Tuscan kale, black garlic, lima and cranberry beans, with cherry tomato confit, was terrifically flavorful, straightforward and clean.It is nice in that dining room, quiet, and if your order goes well with the kitchen, you can have a good meal. If it doesn’t, you’ll be staring down a listless Wiener schnitzel, pale and greasy beneath a thick lemon-caper sauce, with too-tart applesauce. Or at dry veal tenderloin with charred onions, sweetbreads cooked as if to explain why some don’t like them, sweet peaches, pickled ramps and a veal sauce run through with lovage: a meat dessert. One meal ended with a cheesecake made with blue cheese that tasted exactly like what you’d get if you mistakenly made a cheesecake with blue cheese. Your mileage may vary.Times are hard for Bank of America, of course, as for Condé Nast and for many of us besides. Is a fixed-price dice roll in Aureole’s formal dining room worth $84? We shall see.In the meantime, the bulk of the business is out in the bar, which takes up much of the restaurant’s space. It’s loud out there, informal in the corporate sense of the word: men with their jackets off, their striped shirts shiny, their watches big, all of them eating burgers, sliders, fries, draining beer, smiling at clients, on the sell. It’s a tough scene. At every table someone’s either shouting or lap dancing his phone.It’s an extremely good hamburger, though, a big two-hander of rich beef, white Cheddar, applewood-smoked bacon and a pickled-ramp dressing that gives plain mayonnaise a run for its money. With it you’ll want some of the restaurant’s spectacular battered onion rings as well as an order of the papas fritas: a cone of excellent French fries beneath a shower of shredded aged Manchego, some chorizo bits and a saffron aioli that could use more garlic than those fellows eating it would ever abide.There are also fantastic little pastrami pork-belly sliders with raclette, coleslaw and Russian dressing (they’re even on the formal dining room menu at lunch now), three two-bite wonders that are smoky and wonderful, a funny little riff on a deli favorite. And of course Mr. Palmer’s signature appetizer, the sea scallop “sandwich,” which Christopher Lee, Mr. Palmer’s executive chef for the restaurant, who cooked at the old Oceana and received accolades for his command of Gilt, has updated with a napping of sugar snap peas, passion fruit and chives.There is much to enjoy about eating hamburgers on the company dime, of course, or in eating swordfish with creamed spinach, barley and Muscat grapes, especially if you’re drinking a delightful Oregon pinot noir from Domaine Serene along with it, and talking with friends.But note well those grapes, and the passion fruit above. Sweetness is all over these menus. There is apple with the crab cake appetizer (and a fine horseradish dressing as well); a great deal of honey in the mustard that accompanies a deconstructed beef tartare. Fluke sashimi arrives above a tight rectangle of diced edamame, with a yuzu eggplant purée and a shallot ginger dressing that is only slightly tempered by soy. There is caramel popcorn and a funnel cake to accompany the seared foie gras.All of this adds up, in more ways than one, even before you get to dessert. (Yes to the caramel panna cotta and milk chocolate pudding pie.) Everything on the table fits into a diagram of sweet, sour, less sweet, unspicy, plain.The restaurant is a love letter to an America we see reflected back at us in unflattering light: relatively happy, unthinking, desirous mostly of sugar and fat. That’s Vegas for you. It’s not New York.ATMOSPHERE People who sell in the bar, people who own in the dining room.

"'09-11-11,'1','Given the longstanding aversion to borrowing and spending that has shaped German fiscal policy since the great hyperinflation of the Weimar era during the 1920s, Mrs. Merkel and her new finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, have set off a fierce debate by proposing to cut taxes by 24 billion euro, or $35.9 billion, in 2010 and 2011, rather than immediately attack the country’s projected budget gap.“I want us to do everything we can to create the conditions for new, stronger growth,” Mrs. Merkel said Tuesday, laying out her agenda in a speech before the Bundestag in Berlin. “Without growth, there will be no investment. Without growth, no jobs. Without growth, no money for education. Without growth, no help for the weak.”Cutting taxes now and balancing budgets later is a high-wire act for all politicians, of course, and the new German government is divided even within its own ranks over the wisdom of lowering taxes to stimulate the economy.But it is a sign of just how painful the recession has been across the Continent, especially Germany, that officials in Berlin and elsewhere in Europe are so reluctant to reduce borrowing anytime soon because of the risk of harming the incipient recovery.Like Germany, much of Europe is struggling with how to gradually withdraw economic stimulus efforts without compounding still-rising unemployment or throwing their economies back into recession.The terms of the treaty that created the euro currency are supposed to limit each country’s deficit to no more than 3 percent of its G.D.P. None of the 16 countries that use the euro are expected to meet that goal soon, however, with the typical budget deficit projected to reach a record 6.9 percent of G.D.P. next year, according to the European Commission.On Wednesday, the commission is expected to give Germany, France and Spain until 2013 to return their budget gaps to below 3 percent.But it is not clear whether any of them can achieve that goal.For Mrs. Merkel, who strenuously opposed a Europe-wide stimulus package during the depth of the financial crisis last year, the change of approach has been difficult to accept.“Germany has been a kind of symbol for Europe of caution and prudence when it comes to spending,” said Alfred Boss, an economist and specialist in German politics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, who added that Berlin’s new proposals “are not typically German.”“There seems to be a kind of attitude that the tax cuts will finance themselves,” he argued. “It’s nonsense. It’s an attitude prevailing in the U.S., but this kind of thinking seems to be stronger in the new government.”Indeed, a few prominent German politicians have started echoing the supply-side arguments propounded by former President Ronald Reagan and his economists in Washington in the 1980s and carried forward by the Republican Party ever since.“Particularly because the coffers are empty we need fair taxes to jump-start the economic engine so that more money flows into state coffers,” the head of the Free Democratic Party, Guido Westerwelle, said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild.Others within the government are trying to thread the needle more finely.Even as Mrs. Merkel laid out her economic plan in Berlin, Mr. Schäuble told a European Union meeting of finance ministers in Brussels that “a strict budget policy” would allow Berlin to combine tax cuts with deficit reduction over the next four years.But for all the efforts to keep everybody on board, Mrs. Merkel could be on a collision course with much of the business community, as well as Axel A. Weber, the head of the Deutsche Bundesbank, who sits on the governing council of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.In a speech last month, Mr. Weber set 2011 as a crucial deadline for Europe to begin digging out of the stimulus measures and deficit spending now under way.“Given the enormous rise in public deficits and the strain this will put on future budgets, the fiscal exit strategy will have to kick in as soon as the recovery has firmed up, which means no later than 2011,” he said.Among ordinary Germans, the desire for fiscal discipline still runs deep as well, setting the stage for further tensions down the road if the economy lags.A poll published last month by Forsa, the independent polling institute, showed that only 22 percent wanted tax cuts if they would lead to a wider budget deficit and more public borrowing. Nearly 70 percent were against the idea.Moreover, a new law limits federal deficits to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product from 2016 onward and no longer allows the federal states to run deficits at all from 2020 onward.But Prof. Markus Heintzen, economics professor at the Free University in Berlin, reckons such targets will now be very difficult to meet.“Traditionally, inflation, that has been more important to Germans than government borrowing,” Professor Heintzen said. “But now, look at the way the states and local governments have run up huge debts and deficits. The public knows it is worrying.”'"
"'09-11-11,'1','Coming to grips with a great deal of unfamiliar contemporary music is a lot to ask of any group of musicians, but the New Juilliard Ensemble seems to take such things in stride. Consider the concert the group presented on Monday night at Alice Tully Hall: “Composers Living and Working in China Today,” among the final offerings in Carnegie Hall’s extensive festival Ancient Paths, Modern Voices. The concert’s placement made sense: when better to assess where Chinese composers are now than after several weeks of hearing what came before them?Of the six works on the program, one, Li Shaosheng’s “Skyline on the Moon,” was entirely new. Zhu Jian-er’s Symphony No. 4 (“6.4.2-1”) was billed as a Western Hemisphere premiere; Ye Xiaogang’s “Nine Horses” received its first New York performance. Three remaining works, by Liu Sola, Guo Wenjing and Jia Daqun, have figured in previous New Juilliard Ensemble concerts, none of which, presumably, would have involved the players currently under the director Joel Sachs’s guidance.That no one clear style or school emerged among the pieces at hand was even more impressive when you consider that five of the six composers were born in 1955 or 1956 — a small pool to have yielded the wide variety of approaches heard here. The sixth, Mr. Li, born in 1988 and based in Beijing, attended this premiere of his “Skyline on the Moon,” a deftly scored work that veered from lustrous Impressionist washes to folksy Ivesian polytonal clashes.Mr. Li’s piece employed traditional Chinese cymbals and gongs, as did several others. The broad, wobbly string glissandos characteristic of some Chinese classical styles were also often evident here. But to rely on those borrowings as signs of something intrinsic to modern Chinese composition would be like trying to identify American music solely by the presence of saxophones and swing rhythms.Mr. Ye’s work, written for a Pittsburgh ensemble by a composer who spent time at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, was a lean, zippy post-Minimalist romp. Ms. Liu, who initially made her reputation in the West as a singer in jazz and rock bands, ranged from brusque, chanting voices and vigorous percussion to swirling string melodies and angular dance rhythms in “In-Corporeal I.”Mr. Guo’s Concertino for Cello and Ensemble set the cellist Mimi Yu soaring through a Messiaenesque menagerie of twittering birds and chirping frogs. Mr. Jia’s “Three Images From Ink and Wash Painting” offered imaginative analogues to three distinct visual-art styles. After those works the string writing in Mr. Zhu’s symphony seemed overly gray and astringent, but Chen Tao, a skillful soloist on dizi, a Chinese bamboo flute, provided enough charisma to compensate.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','The prime minister, who lost the sight in one eye as a child and sees poorly from the other eye, makes a point of sending a handwritten letter to the family of every British soldier who has died in Afghanistan — 232 so far.Ms. Janes has the righteous indignation of a desperately grieving parent on her side. She also has an array of tabloid newspapers, led by The Sun, which in the last two days has published a copy of the offending letter and a recording of a subsequent, unpleasant telephone conversation between Ms. Janes and Mr. Brown.In another episode that did not go as Mr. Brown had hoped, the prime minister was accused of failing to show sufficient respect as he laid a wreath on Sunday during ’s annual Remembrance Day ceremony to commemorate soldiers killed in wartime.“Bereaved relatives and TV viewers watching the Remembrance Sunday ceremony were incensed when it appeared the prime minister abandoned the convention that politicians step back and bow their head after paying homage in Whitehall,” wrote The Daily Express in a news article whose headline was “Shame on you, Mr. Brown.”In the Labour Party-hating Daily Mail, the columnist Richard Littlejohn said that while Mr. Brown was hapless, he was also hopeless.While “these so-called ‘gaffes’ can be attributed to Brown’s characteristic and social ,” he wrote, “a likeable, successful prime minister would not have attracted such ferocious condemnation over a minor lapse of Remembrance protocol and a misspelt letter.”Mr. Brown telephoned Ms. Janes on Sunday in an effort to smooth things over. But the call, which lasted minutes and which Ms. Janes recorded, was combative almost from the beginning, at least on Ms. Janes’s part. The two talked for some time about whether the troops in Afghanistan were being properly equipped.And then they tussled over whether Mr. Brown was unable to spell, or merely unable to write legibly. “My writing is maybe so bad that you can’t read it,” he told her, according to the transcript in The Sun. “I think I was trying to say ‘Janes’ as your right name. Maybe my writing looks bad, but I was just trying to say your right name.”But Ms. Janes was having none of it.“I’ve got the letter in front of me, as you know,” she says. “I beg to differ. I can’t believe that I am now being brought to the level of having an argument with the prime minister of our country.”Several members of the government accused the Murdoch-owned Sun, which this fall switched allegiance from Labour to the Conservative Party, of exploiting Ms. Janes’s grief for its own political agenda.At his monthly news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Brown appeared exhausted and upset by the events. But he stuck to the view that he has poor handwriting rather than poor spelling. As a parent, he said, he understands the rawness of Ms. Janes’s emotions.“I wanted to say in that conversation with her, but could not really do so because I did not know her, that when there is a personal loss as deep and immediate as she has experienced, it takes time to recover,” he said.Ms. Janes told The Sun that in the telephone conversation, Mr. Brown had never apologized. But the transcript shows that he said he was sorry, almost pleadingly so.“What I want to do is to pass on my condolences and to say, however strongly you feel about my mistakes in this matter, I still feel very, very personally sad about the death of your son,” he tells her. “I want you to know that, and I’m sorry if you’ve taken offense at my letter.”The transcript, which carefully notes every “er” and stammer as the prime minister struggles to find the right words, continues: “I’ve tried my best, er, to faithfully reflect my feelings about the loss of your son and the contribution he made, er, and, er, thank you very much for talking to me this evening.”'"
"'09-11-11,'1','During chamber music concerts, even if the whole performance is first-rate, there is sometimes one riveting moment in which the ensemble seems particularly cohesive. When the excellent Keller Quartet made its debut at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday afternoon, that moment came in the slow movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet in F (Op. 135).The Keller Quartet (the violinists Andras Keller and Janos Pilz, the violist Zoltan Gal and the cellist Judit Szabo) was founded in 1987 at the Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, and mentored by Gyorgy Kurtag.They performed the Lento in Opus 135, Beethoven’s final string quartet, with a warm, glowing sound and expressive potency, and captured the gracious spirit of the outer movements. The work was a lithe conclusion to a hefty program that opened with Beethoven’s “Grosse Fuge” (Op. 133).The hall’s air-conditioner had broken on an unseasonably warm day, so the players had to tackle the dense polyphonic textures of the Fugue (after its 1826 premiere, one reviewer described it as “incomprehensible as Chinese”) in what felt like almost tropical heat.The musicians dove into the almost cacophonous thickets of the Fugue (written as the final movement of the String Quartet in B flat, Op. 130), with gritty zeal. Beethoven offers relief for players (and listeners) with a few gentler interludes before the contrapuntal storm returns with renewed fervor.Sandwiched between the two Beethoven quartets were Ligeti’s Quartet No. 1, “Métamorphoses Nocturnes,” and Bartok’s Quartet No. 3. It’s a testament to the radical nature of the Fugue, which Arnold Schoenberg interpreted as a precursor of atonality, that the piece sounds entirely at home when paired with those composers.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','Michael Phelps’s presence on a United States team competing this week at a World Cup meet in Stockholm is akin to Meryl Streep’s gracing a traveling production of “Mamma Mia!” Phelps, a 14-time Olympic gold medalist, is a headliner among up-and-comers on the national youth World Cup team.Phelps may be the star, but he struggled in his first races in the short-course competition, contested in a 25-meter pool instead of an Olympic-size 50-meter pool. He failed to advance to the eight-man final after finishing 16th in the preliminaries of the 100 freestyle, a race he added to his repertory after the 2008 Olympics.He was also disqualified from the 100 backstroke. He finished seventh in the preliminaries of the 100 individual medley, an event not included in major meets, and took third in the final.In the women’s 50 backstroke, another non-Olympic event, Jing Zhao of China set a world record twice. Her time of 26.08 seconds in the preliminary eclipsed the 26.17 set Saturday in Moscow by Marieke Guehrer of Australia. She then won the final in 25.82, with Guehrer second in 25.98.Phelps, 24, is the rare performer at the meet who is not trying to squeeze every last sizzling swim out of the long-length, nontextile swimsuits that will soon be illegal. Phelps helped bring about the ban by swimming’s international governing body, FINA, with his strenuous objections to the new suits at the world championships over the summer.Phelps, wearing the Speedo Fastskin FS-PRO model, is scheduled to race in two events that were part of his 2004 and 2008 Olympic programs, the 100 butterfly and the 200 individual medley. He is using this meet and another World Cup event this weekend in Berlin to help the younger American swimmers and to gauge his fitness level with an eye toward the 2010 national championships in July. By then, the old suits will once again be in vogue.'"
"'09-11-11,'1','In the House, Representative has guided the Financial Services Committee through meetings that could lead to passage of a comprehensive bill by the full House as early as next month. His committee has already approved a host of major regulatory changes and is expected to complete work soon on a measure that would give the government greater authority to seize large and troubled financial companies.But in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to move contentious legislation through the chamber, Mr. Dodd has considerable work ahead of him.Senior administration officials said the Dodd plan was a good starting point that, while different from the White House plan in major ways, embraced its core principles and addressed many of the problems that had been identified as causes of the financial crisis.Secretary said that the legislation “moves us one step closer toward comprehensive financial reform.”Mr. Dodd and his staff had held regular meetings with Senator Richard C. Shelby of , the ranking Republican on the banking committee, but those talks recently broke down. Mr. Shelby is opposed to several central provisions of Mr. Dodd’s bill, most notably the creation of an agency to protect consumers from abusive and deceptive and credit cards. Mr. Dodd has yet to get a Republican to support his plan. Moreover, several provisions will probably be opposed by moderate and conservative Democrats with ties to industry groups that have raised objections to the measure.Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, said the proposal “would tear apart the existing regulatory structure only to create a new one that would produce conflicts among regulators, undermine the state-chartered banking system and impose extensive new regulatory burdens on those that had nothing to do with creating the financial crisis.”Officials at the Consumer Federation of America issued a statement that applauded the proposed new consumer protection agency and the provisions protecting investors.The Dodd proposal would create an agency to monitor and address systemic risks posed by large financial companies. It would give the agency the authority to write tougher capital standards and to break up companies if they posed a threat to the financial stability of the nation.The proposal would merge the current federal supervisory oversight of the banking system from four agencies into one new agency. It would create a separate division within that agency to regulate smaller banks. The biggest losers under such a plan would be the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, two of the bank agencies that would go out of the business of day-to-day supervision of thousands of institutions.Both the White House and the House plan do not go that far in consolidating agencies. Rather, they would merge the four bank agencies into three by combining the Office of the Comptroller, which regulates federally chartered banks, with the Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises savings and loans. They would not change the authority of the Federal Reserve and the to regulate banks.One big winner under Mr. Dodd’s plan is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would get greater authority and more resources.Adopting a proposal by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, the plan would permit the commission to retain the fees it charges Wall Street. By being self-financed, the commission would not only have a larger budget, but also be free of the political constraints of relying on Congressional appropriations. Last year the commission received about $1.5 billion, which it turned over to the Treasury, while it received about $880 million in appropriations, Mr. Schumer said. Democratic and Republican leaders of the commission have sought such authority for decades, but Congress, which prefers to use the power of the purse as a tool to supervise the agency, has never agreed.Mr. Dodd’s plan would impose tighter restrictions on the largely unregulated derivatives market. It would require many derivatives to be traded through clearinghouses where they could be monitored.The measure would require that hedge funds with more than $100 million in assets be registered with the S.E.C. and disclose financial information.'"

"'09-11-12,'0','""Here's how it works. They configure the phones to have multiple easily hit keystrokes to launch 'Get it now' or 'Mobile Web'--usually a single key like an arrow key. Often we have no idea what key we hit, but up pops one of these screens. The instant you call the function, they charge you the data fee. We cancel these unintended requests as fast as we can hit the End key, but it doesn't matter; they've told me that ANY data--even one kilobyte--is billed as 1MB. The damage is done.""Imagine: if my one account has 1 to 3 bogus $1.99 charges per month for data that I don't download, how much are they making from their 87 million other customers? Not a bad scheme. All by simply writing your billing algorithm to bill a full MB when even a few bits have moved.""As it turns out, my correspondent is quite correct. My last couple of Verizon phones did indeed have non-reprogrammable, dedicated keys for those ridiculously overpriced ""Get it now""-type services that I would never use in a million years.At about the same time, I got a note from a reader who says he actually works at Verizon, and he's annoyed enough about the practice to blow the whistle:""The phone is designed in such a way that you can almost never avoid getting $1.99 charge on the bill. Around the OK button on a typical flip phone are the up, down, left, right arrows. If you open the flip and accidentally press the up arrow key, you see that the phone starts to connect to the web. So you hit END right away. Well, too late. You will be charged $1.99 for that 0.02 kilobytes of data. NOT COOL. I've had phones for years, and I sometimes do that mistake to this day, as I'm sure you have. Legal, yes; ethical, NO.""Every month, the 87 million customers will accidentally hit that key a few times a month! That's over $300 million per month in data revenue off a simple mistake!""Our marketing, billing, and technical departments are all aware of this. But they have failed to do anything about it--and why? Because if you get 87 million customers to pay $1.99, why stop this revenue? Customer Service might credit you if you call and complain, but this practice is just not right.""Now, you can ask to have this feature blocked. But even then, if you one of those buttons by accident, your phone transmits data; you get a message that you cannot use the service because it's blocked--BUT you just used 0.06 kilobytes of data to get that message, so you are now charged $1.99 again!""They have started training us reps that too many data blocks are being put on accounts now; they're actually making us take classes called Alternatives to Data Blocks. They do not want all the blocks, because 40% of Verizon's revenue now comes from data use. I just know there are millions of people out there that don't even notice this $1.99 on the bill.""Look, it's very simple.The more Verizon gouges, the worse it looks. Every single day, I get e-mail from people saying they're switching at the first opportunity, or would if they could. In time, the only people who will stay with Verizon are people who have no coverage with any other carrier.Every company's dream, right? A base of miserable customers who stick with you only because they have no choice.I realize that it's a business, that Verizon exists to make money. But the part I don't get is, why doesn't Verizon calculate the business cost of making customers unhappy? Surely some accountant can show that customer anger over these fees and dirty button tricks translate into negative corporate image, and therefore lost business.Why wouldn't it be a hugely profitable move to start pitching yourself as the GOOD cell company, the one that actually LIKES its customers?Here are four baby steps: (1) Let us bypass the 15 seconds of pointless voice mail instructions (Verizon is the only carrier who never responded to my campaign; see http://bit.ly/nIgE2).(2) Make your early-termination fee reflect your actual cost, rather than being a profit center in its own right.(3) If a data connection is obviously an error--under 10 seconds, say--don't bill for it.(4) And for heaven's sake, quit imposing your own profit-center buttons on our cellphone designs. If we want to go online for $2 a megabyte, we'll find a way.'"

"'09-11-12,'0','The authorities were searching a rural property in western Missouri for bodies and buried glass jars containing notes written more than 15 years ago by children who may have documented sexual abuse by five members of their own family. Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh of Lafayette County said the authorities believed there might be bodies buried on the property outside Bates City, about 30 miles east of Kansas City. The five men were arrested Tuesday and are charged with several felonies, including forcible sodomy, rape with a child younger than 12 and use of a child in a sexual performance. The accusations date fom 1988 to 1995. Cpl. Bill Lowe of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said one of the children, now 26, came forward in mid-August. Corporal Lowe said the woman told investigators that she and the other children buried glass jars around the property, filled with messages “about what was happening to them” when they were younger. “Those jars have that information,” he said.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','A GRIM reality sits behind the joyful press statements from Washington Democrats. To secure passage of health care legislation in the House, the party chose a course that risks the well-being of millions of women for generations to come.House Democrats voted to expand the current ban on public financing for abortion and to effectively prohibit women who participate in the proposed health system from obtaining private insurance that covers the full range of reproductive health options. Political calculation aside, the House Democrats reinforced the principle that a minority view on the morality of abortion can determine reproductive health policy for American women.Many House members who support abortion rights decided reluctantly to accept this ban, which is embodied in the Stupak-Pitts amendment. They say the tradeoff was necessary to advance the right to guaranteed health care. They say they will fight another day for a woman’s right to choose.Perhaps. But they can’t ignore the underlying shift that has taken place in recent years. The Democratic majority has abandoned its platform and subordinated women’s health to short-term political success. In doing so, these so-called friends of women’s rights have arguably done more to undermine reproductive rights than some of abortion’s staunchest foes. That Senate Democrats are poised to allow similar anti-abortion language in their bill simply underscores the degree of the damage that has been done.Many women — ourselves included — warned the Democratic Party in 2004 that it was a mistake to build a Congressional majority by recruiting and electing candidates opposed to the party’s commitment to legal abortion and to public financing for the procedure. Instead, the lust for power yielded to misguided, self-serving poll analysis by operatives with no experience in the fight for these principles. They mistakenly believed that giving leadership roles to a small minority of anti-abortion Democrats would solve the party’s image problems with “values voters” and answer critics who claimed Democrats were hostile to religion.Democrats were told to stop talking about abortion as a moral and legal right and to focus instead on comforting language about reducing the number of abortions. In this regard, President Obama was right on message when he declared in his health care speech to Congress in September that “under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions” — as if this happened to be a good and moral thing. (The tone of his statement made the point even more sharply than his words.)'"
"'09-11-12,'0','In contrast, charitable gift annuities are a liability, because in exchange for a gift, the nonprofit promises to pay a fixed amount of money annually to the donor and perhaps the surviving spouse for the rest of his or her life.Richard L. Fox, a lawyer with Dilworth Paxson in Philadelphia and author of “Charitable Giving: Taxation, Planning, and Strategies” (Thomson Reuters, 2008), said the court’s finding was unfair to donors, adding, “I don’t think any donor ever envisioned that if the charity does something that screws up its finances that the donor-advised fund is going to be invaded.”Of course, contributors to many other donor-advised funds have suffered recently, as account values plummeted. When that happens or a fund goes bust, the recipient charities lose out and the intent of donors is thwarted.Jane Wilton, general counsel of the New York Community Trust, one of the country’s largest community foundations, said the organization discouraged donors who regularly add funds to the accounts and make grants, rather than letting money accumulate, from taking market risks. At many donor-advised funds, contributors can recommend a variety of investment approaches.To set up a donor-advised fund account, contributors make an irrevocable donation to the charity offering the program — which may be affiliated with a university, religious organization or financial institution — and may claim an income tax deduction. After the donation, contributors can make recommendations about which charities should receive grants from the account, and the sponsoring charity generally honors their wishes. But it is not required to.Maurice and Theresa Townsley of Monterey, Calif., donated cash and property totaling $1.2 million to an account with the National Heritage Foundation. They later learned that the foundation had pledged most of their donation as collateral for a bank loan taken out before the bankruptcy. With court approval, the foundation applied those funds to pay off the loan in September.The Townsleys, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and eight other donors have each filed a separate case, accusing the foundation of deceiving them into making donations. The court has not yet ruled on this issue. When the foundation filed for bankruptcy protection, about 200 people with donor-advised fund accounts filed claims; all were rejected except for the nine asserting misrepresentation.The foundation describes itself as providing various support services for donors and says on its Web site (www.nhf.org) that it “has become the ‘gold standard’ of donor-advised funds.” However, Kim Wright-Violich, president of the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving, said the foundation had a long history of run-ins with the Internal Revenue Service and of practices that were subsequently outlawed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.Jan H. Ridgely, vice president of the foundation and daughter of its founder and chief executive, J. T. Houk II, said what happened to donors was “tragic and unavoidable,” caused by a $6.2 million judgment awarded to a Texas family that then became a creditor. The board of directors includes her mother, Marian, and brother, John T. Houk III.Faced with shrunken endowments, charities are seeking to bolster giving by heavily marketing gift annuities, emphasizing the income stream they offer. Most charities base their payments on the suggested maximum rates from the American Council on Gift Annuities (available at www.acga-web.org). These are lower than those of annuities from commercial insurance carriers because gift annuities factor in an assumption that when the donor dies the charity will get about 50 percent of the initial value of the amount transferred.Many people holding these assets are retired. For example, the UJA-Federation of New York has about 900 annuitants whose average age is 78, said William Samers, the organization’s vice president of planned giving and endowments. But he cautioned donors shopping for gift annuities that these investments are not a certainty. They are backed by the assets of the charity, and if the endowment dries up or the organization shuts, the payments will stop. In a bankruptcy case, the annuity holder becomes an unsecured creditor.That’s what happened to William N. Anderson, 78, a retired salesman in Traverse City, Mich., who had gift annuities with the National Heritage Foundation. Starting in 2000, he invested a total of $235,000 in three separate annuities, each paying about 8 percent annually. Together they provided monthly income to him of $1,700.Under the reorganization plan, the foundation must provide each annuity holder a lump sum based on various factors. Court papers show that the total payments for all the annuitants will be $14.5 million.Mr. Anderson said he was disappointed that the three charities he had designated to receive whatever was left when he died will get nothing, although he has been told he will be paid $131,239 under the reorganization.“That will roughly compensate him for what he would have received had the annuity remained in effect,” said Lawrence P. Katzenstein, a lawyer with Thompson Coburn in St. Louis, and creator of Tiger Tables Actuarial Software, which computes the value of the interests transferred and those retained through a variety of charitable giving tools.To avoid getting burned, experts recommend checking a charity’s track record and financial stability. The organization’s tax return, called Form 990, is generally available upon request or on its Web site. Ask, too, for audited financial statements to compare assets to liabilities, including pending or recently resolved lawsuits.Note that ratings of charities, like those available on charitynavigator.org, tend to be based on grant-making efficiency, rather than on how much a charity holds in its endowment to cover liabilities, said Laura H. Peebles, a director in the national office at Deloitte Tax in Washington.Choose a charity that has been in the business for at least 15 years and has a reputable financial institution managing its assets, said Mr. Samers at the UJA-Federation of New York.The charity must be licensed to offer annuities in any states where it issues them, and requirements vary, Mr. Fox said. (For a state-by-state summary, see www.acga-web.org/regs/regsoverview.html) New York and California are among the more rigorous; Arizona is considerably less so. The most important criterion is how much money the charity must set aside to meet its liability — known as the reserve fund.A conservative approach, whether required by state law or applied at the charity’s own initiative, is to keep more in the reserve than the charity owes. Ideally it should also have a substantial endowment. In order to back up annuities, these funds must be unrestricted, meaning they are not set aside for other purposes.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','Now, Congress is looking for someone to blame for the shootings at Fort Hood. The Defense Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are reviewing whether they missed significant clues — or whether Walter Reed ignored signs of serious trouble — that might have averted the shootings. Already, the military and F.B.I. officials have begun an inevitable round of finger-pointing.But a striking fact is that the system set up after Sept. 11, 2001, to make sure clues of a coming attack were not missed actually worked as intended — and still failed to stop the deadly episode. The question for investigators is whether the very fact that Major Hasan sent the e-mail messages to an imam with mysterious connections to the Sept. 11 hijackers and a Web site encouraging extremist violence should have set off greater alarms.“The fact that they got these e-mails and acted on them shows that at least to a point, the system worked,” said Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of “The Secret Sentry,” a new history of the National Security Agency. “Quite possibly someone dropped the ball down the line.”Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said any contact with Mr. Awlaki should have raised red flags. “There’s no doubt that Awlaki is a vessel for the message of Al Qaeda whose goal is radicalizing others,” he said. “Any contact should generate serious concern.”Mr. Hoffman, too, said the intelligence network, in catching the messages and passing them on, worked far better than would have been likely before the 2001 attacks. “But 13 people are dead,” he added. “What are we going to do differently next time?”When the Joint Terrorism Task Force began its inquiry, the Defense Department criminal investigator limited his review to paper records, not interviewing Major Hasan or his co-workers. The investigator also did not alert anyone at Walter Reed or elsewhere in the Army or Defense Department to the e-mail contacts with Mr. Awlaki.Officials familiar with the work of the Washington task force said the Hasan assessment was one of hundreds involving government employees undertaken each year. Such inquiries can be hampered, they said, by privacy laws that prevent the sharing of personal information about someone unless it reflects evidence of wrongdoing or a potential threat.Had the task force investigator spoken with Major Hasan’s psychiatric colleagues, he would have found a mixed picture. Some co-workers at Walter Reed and the Uniformed Services University said in interviews that they found his conduct troubling at times.National Public Radio reported on Wednesday that from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009, when Major Hasan, then a captain, was on a fellowship at the Uniformed Services University, senior faculty members and administrators from the two institutions discussed on several occasions whether he was mentally fit to be an Army psychiatrist, but eventually sent him on to Fort Hood.Other faculty members and students have expressed alarm about Power Point presentations Major Hasan delivered both as a senior resident at Walter Reed and during his fellowship. In one presentation in June 2007, first reported by The Washington Post, Major Hasan argued that the Army should allow Muslim soldiers to leave the military as conscientious objectors if they refused to kill other Muslims, and he warned of “adverse events” if it did not.Other colleagues had a more benign view of Major Hasan. Nancy Meyer, a social worker who attended the 2007 presentation, described it as a scholarly explanation of why “Muslims should not be in a position to harm other Muslims,” saying she did not take it as “at all threatening.” Ms. Meyer added, however, that when she heard Major Hasan had been charged with the shootings, the lecture was the first thing that came to her mind.Dr. Aaron Haney, who was a year ahead of Major Hasan in the residency program at Walter Reed, said there were some faculty members who did not like Major Hasan because they thought “he was not as much of a pro-active go-getter type, like the military really like.”In completing his report six months ago, the terrorism task force investigator concluded that the e-mail messages were consistent with Major Hasan’s research efforts, did not suggest violence and did not justify further inquiry — a judgment that represented the task force’s collective view. The case was closed.In the days since the shootings, Pentagon officials have faulted the F.B.I., asserting that because it supervises the task force, the agency should have informed the Defense Department about the e-mail messages.Law enforcement officials have denied that they were at fault. They said the defense investigator could have shared his assessment of Major Hasan’s e-mail messages with the Defense Department.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','The American International Group’s chief executive on Wednesday tried to calm fears that he was about to jump ship, with an open letter to employees announcing he was “totally committed to leading A.I.G. through its challenges.”Robert Benmosche, chief executive of the insurer since August, confirmed that he was “frustrated” about how long it was taking to devise an executive compensation plan that was “fair” but did not violate the restrictions the government has placed on companies that are receiving taxpayer assistance.Mr. Benmosche told employees he was “continuing to fight on your behalf,” and urged them “not to be distracted by speculative media stories, and to maintain your focus on the important work you are doing.”Concern that Mr. Benmosche was on the brink of leaving flared after The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that he had boiled over during a board meeting, and said that he was “done.”Mark Herr, a spokesman for A.I.G., declined to explain why Mr. Benmosche had called the report “speculative.”The board meeting followed a long and contentious session with the Treasury’s special master for compensation, Kenneth R. Feinberg. Mr. Feinberg has been reviewing A.I.G.’s compensation structure for its 100 highest-paid executives to make sure it does not promote excessive risk-taking or squander taxpayer money.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','Enke could have been with the team but for a recent intestinal infection, and Oliver Bierhoff, the national squad manager, summed it up, “We are too shocked to find words.”Enke’s car, a Mercedes, was found near the crossing, unlocked and with his wallet on the passenger seat. The two train drivers saw a man on the track and applied the brakes, but at 160 kilometers an hour, or 100 miles an hour, it was too late to prevent the death.The police said there was a suicide note, and German newspapers ran with two lines of commentary. One was that Enke, a quiet and reserved individual, was a troubled man ever since his biological daughter, Lara, died at the age of 2 in September 2006. She had a rare heart malformation. The other was the loneliness, the uncertainty, of a goalie’s situation.On Wednesday afternoon, Teresa Enke said at a news conference attended by her husband’s psychologist that he was first treated in 2003. “When he was acutely depressive, he lacked motivation and hope,” she said. “I tried to be there for him. I said football is not everything, there are many beautiful things in life, it is not hopeless.”The psychologist, Dr. Valentin Markser, said Enke had a fear of failure.Enke had chosen as a boy to play in the most exposed position, the last line of defense, and the one first blamed when things go wrong. Born in Jena, in East Germany, he joined SV Jena Pharm in 1985, when he was 8.He moved to Carl Zeiss Jena the next year and had been moving on ever since.There were three years at Borussia Mönchengladbach, three years in Portugal with Benfica, a squad that went through three coaching changes while he was there and had financial difficulties that resulted in players sometimes being paid late.Enke’s counseling began when he moved to Barcelona. He was the eternal understudy there, the rising German keeper given just three opportunities with the first team. Barcelona thought highly of him, but lent him to Fenerbache of Istanbul, then to Tenerife. His Turkish misadventure lasted just one match, a loss after which Fenerbache fans bombarded him with firecrackers and missiles in their anger at losing.Finally, he found relative security at Hannover, where he stayed for five years despite offers to move to more glamorous clubs. He was the team captain, chosen in part by his fellow players. When Jens Lehmann retired from Germany’s national team after Euro 2008, Enke was expected to be entrusted with the jersey.It was not certain. In goalkeeping, more than any other position, you are only as good as your last mistake. Trust is between the coach and the last man standing, and that presupposes that the goalie has the style, the personality and the authority that defenders in front of him also like and trust.Enke was being pressed by René Adler, the 24-year-old Leipzig-born goalkeeper. Enke had more experience, Adler has youth, greater height and reach, and the advantage of playing for Bayer Leverkusen, which currently leads Germany’s Bundesliga.Joachim Löw, the coach, was thought to favor Enke for the 2010 World Cup. But of course no trainer would make such a promise to one goalie, because it would be too great a disincentive to the others.It seems the professional uncertainty fed Enke’s anxiety. Illness and injury could not have helped. A year ago, shortly after Lehmann left the national squad, Enke lost two months to a broken bone in his hand.In his final game for the German national team in August, he had a goalkeeper’s dream score, shutting out Azerbaijan. Then he contracted an intestinal virus that cost him another nine weeks. He had just returned to Hannover’s lineup.The loneliness of a player sidelined for months, the exclusion from the team training and comradeship, are all part of the professional experience.As fans laid wreaths and lighted candles at the gates of the stadium, Teresa Enke faced the news media there. She said: “He was scared of losing Leila if his depression came out. Now it is coming out anyway. We thought we could do everything with love, but you can’t always do it.”And so along with his widow, a club and the national team also mourn for a man who took his own life near the peak of his sporting career.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','Because of low demand among parents of school-age children, city health officials are opening their swine flu vaccination clinics to a broader group of people this weekend, city officials said.People 25 to 64 who have underlying health problems, like diabetes, asthma or chronic heart and lung conditions, and caretakers of infants less than 6 months old are now eligible for free vaccinations, said Jessica Scaperotti, a spokeswoman for the health department.The clinics, which were originally intended for middle and high school students, were opened up last weekend to pregnant women and people 4 to 24. Fewer than 3,500 people turned out for the free vaccinations on Saturday and Sunday.The vaccine is also being offered at public elementary schools, as well as at private and parochial schools that have requested doses.The weekend clinics will continue for four more weekends. New Yorkers can find the nearest clinic on the city’s flu information Web site, nyc.gov/flu.In addition, two neighborhood health centers will offer free vaccinations on Thursday and Friday, as part of an effort to reach low-income people. They will be given at Beth Israel’s Phillips Ambulatory Care Center in Manhattan and the Community Healthcare Network in Long Island City, Queens.Eleven health centers that are part of the same campaign have offered vaccinations so far, said Daniel Lowenstein, a spokesman for the Primary Care Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization that is one of the sponsors.Turnout at those clinics has been brisk, an average of 400 people each day, he said. There are no formal restrictions on who can receive the vaccine at the centers. “Nobody will be turned away,” Mr. Lowenstein said.In New Jersey on Tuesday, a trade group representing hospitals throughout the state recommended that the hospitals bar people under 18 from entering visiting rooms, as a measure to slow the spread of swine flu.Brian Conway, a spokesman for the Greater New York Hospital Association, said he did not expect the group to make a similar recommendation.“We have had discussions with our hospital members about this issue, particularly the topic of children visiting,” Mr. Conway said. “But we believe it’s a decision best left to each individual hospital.”'"
"'09-11-12,'0','“You can waste a lot of time on Facebook,” said Ms. Shih, founder of Hearsay Labs, a Facebook marketing software company. “But if you’re a business, you don’t have any time to waste. Figure out your objectives first, start small and do things that help you accomplish your objectives.”Ms. Shih suggests that businesses ask friends and family to become fans of their pages so that they display a respectable crowd of supporters when they debut. Pages can grow organically by word of mouth — the average Facebook user has 130 friends on the site — or by advertising or promotion.You can enliven your page with photos, comments and useful information. As you grow more comfortable, you can add videos or business applications. Flaunt your personality. The page of an ice cream parlor should feel different than that of a funeral parlor. “The pages that are most successful,” said Tim Kendall, the director of monetization at Facebook, “are the ones that really replicate the personality of the business.”It’s Not All About SellingArt Meets Commerce, a New York marketing firm, has struck up a never-ending conversation with fans. The company uses Facebook as a crucial part of its publicity campaigns for theatrical productions. Its Facebook page for the show “Rock of Ages,” for example, has more than 13,000 fans.Staff members constantly update the page with new photos, videos and quotes from the cast. They’ve also learned what not to do: Once they posted a video of Paris Hilton plugging the show and got negative feedback from fans who professed to be sick of her.But it’s not just about marketing — or, at least, it’s not just about selling. “You end up moving away from being an Internet marketer and go into almost customer service,” said Jim Glaub, creative director at the agency. “A lot of times people use Facebook to ask questions: What’s the student rush? How long is the show? Where’s parking? You have to answer.”Some basic rules: Buy-buy-buy messages won’t fly. The best practitioners make Facebook less about selling and more about interacting. Engage with fans and critics. Listen to what people are saying, good and bad. You may even pick up ideas for how to improve your business. Keep content fresh. Use status updates and newsfeeds to tell fans about specials, events, contests or anything of interest.These interactions can take a vast amount of time — the “Rock of Ages” page has 300 to 600 interactions every week — but they can also provide a big payoff. Facebook is one of the show’s top sources of new ticket sales.Last year, Art Meets Commerce introduced a Facebook ad campaign to promote an Off Broadway run of the musical “Fela!” The campaign aimed at Facebook users with interests like theatrical shows or Afro beat. According to the company, it generated 18 million impressions, more than 5,700 clicks and $40,000 in ticket sales — all for $4,400 spent on advertising.“We can advertise all day, but if we don’t give them what they want they will not be a fan anymore,” said Mark Seeley, a marketing associate at Art Meets Commerce. “Even though we represent the shows as marketers, we don’t want to constantly tell people to buy tickets. You talk to them like you talk to your friends on Facebook.”Some guys use Facebook to find single women. Chris Meyer used it to find women who are already engaged.Mr. Meyer, a wedding photographer in Woodbury, Minn., had had little luck with traditional advertising. A full-page ad in a bridal magazine generated zero leads and a trade show yielded only four bookings, barely covering the cost of his booth. But Facebook proved a digital bonanza.Mr. Meyer aimed at women ages 22 to 28 who listed their marital status as engaged in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. He estimates that he has spent about $300 on Facebook ads in the last two years and has generated more than $60,000 in business. He says about three-quarters of his clients now come to him through Facebook, either from ads or recommendations from friends.“I’d be out of business if I didn’t have Facebook,” Mr. Meyer said. “Especially with this economy, I need to stretch each marketing dollar as much as I possibly can.”Facebook enables small businesses to engage in targeted marketing that they only could have dreamed about a few years ago. Facebook users fill out profiles with information like hometown, employer, religious beliefs, interests, education and favorite books, movies and TV shows — all of which can help advertisers deliver messages to specific demographic slices.As you create an ad, you can add demographic criteria and keywords and see how many Facebook users fall into your target audience and modify it accordingly to get the most bang for your buck. Advertisers can elect to pay per impression or per click, set maximum budgets and schedule the ad to run on specific dates.Thus a coffee shop in San Francisco can display advertisements only to local people whose profiles or group affiliations suggest they like coffee. According to Mr. Kendall, Facebook’s director of monetization, ads can also aim at people based on social exchanges, like a person who sends a message to a friend, “let’s get together for coffee” or who posts a status update about just having awakened and needing some java.“We can help you find customers before they even think about searching for you,” Mr. Kendall said. “We’re very, very well-positioned to generate demand, based on the fact that we know a tremendous amount about a user.”The Facebook ad system provides instant feedback with metrics like the number of impressions and clicks-through. This reporting allows Mr. Meyer to improve his advertising; if one ad doesn’t generate enough hits within 24 hours, he pulls it and tries something new.Charles Nelson has an M.B.A. and is a former investment banker who owns a growing national chain of stores. Yet this 40-year-old entrepreneur checks Facebook with the frequency of a college student. Up to 30 times a day, he logs onto the social networking site via his laptop or Blackberry.For Mr. Nelson, this is serious business. He and his wife, Candace, own Sprinkles, a cupcake bakery that relies on social media in lieu of traditional advertising. Mr. Nelson considers Facebook marketing essential. “People are out there talking about your business everyday, whether you’re looking or not,” he said. “This gives people a place to come and speak directly to us.”Sprinkles uses Facebook to give customers a whiff of what’s cooking. Every day it posts a password on Facebook that can be redeemed for a free cupcake. Since April, its fan base has risen tenfold to 70,000.Mr. Nelson and his wife previously worked as investment bankers in the technology sector and were keenly aware that, even for a traditional business like a bakery, social media is a crucial ingredient. His advice: make it relevant to the customer, keep it fresh and remember that the return on investment may come slowly.“Be patient with it,” Mr. Nelson advised. “People are not going to flock to your social media site overnight. Technology is about the network effect. It takes time for those connections to build.”'"
"'09-11-12,'0','Over the years France has given New York everything from the Statue of Liberty to Daniel Boulud, and now, in its latest act of trans-Atlantic generosity, it plans to lend the city two dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet. The New York City Ballet said Aurélie Dupont and Mathias Heymann will perform at City Ballet’s opening-night benefit on Nov. 24. Ms. Dupont and Mr. Heymann (who are among the dancers featured in the Frederick Wiseman documentary “La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet”) are to perform the “Rubies” pas de deux from George Balanchine’s “Jewels.” The other half of the bargain (struck by Brigitte Lefèvre, the dance director of the Paris Opera Ballet, and Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of City Ballet) is that Paris gets to borrow Ashley Bouder and Gonzalo Garcia from City Ballet, who will dance the leading roles in “Rubies” for the Paris Opera Ballet on Thursday at the Palais Garnier. The City Ballet benefit will take place at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','The Mormon Church has been a target of vituperation by some gay rights groups because of its active opposition to same-sex marriage. But on Wednesday, the church was being praised by gay rights activists in Salt Lake City, citadel of the Mormon world, for its open support of a local ordinance banning discrimination against gay men and lesbians in housing and employment.The ordinance, which passed unanimously Tuesday night, made Salt Lake the first city in Utah to offer such protections. While the measure probably had majority backing on the seven-member City Council anyway, the church’s support was seen by gay activists as a thunderclap that would resonate across the state and in the overwhelmingly Mormon legislature, where even subtle shifts in church positions on social issues can swing votes and sentiments.“It’s the most progressive and inclusive statement that the church has made on these issues,” said Will Carlson, the manager of public policy at Equality Utah, the state’s largest gay rights group. “What they’ve said here is huge, in protecting residents in other municipalities, and statewide.”In its statement backing the ordinance, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said that while it remained “unequivocally committed to defending the bedrock foundation of marriage between a man and a woman,” the question of how people were treated on the job and in finding places to live were matters of fairness that did not have anything to do with marriage.“Across America and around the world, diverse communities such as ours are wrestling with complex social and moral questions,” Michael R. Otterson, a church spokesman, said in a statement to the City Council. “The issues before you tonight are the right of people to have a roof over their heads and the right to work without being discriminated against.”Mr. Carlson at Equality Utah said the wording of the church’s statement was crucial. The church previously had used more neutral language when asked about antidiscrimination statutes or hate-crimes legislation, often saying that it was “not opposed” to such measures.'"
"'09-11-12,'0','KABUL, Afghanistan — A week after two American soldiers disappeared in northwest Afghanistan, the body of one of them has been found by a military dive team, a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The two men disappeared while trying to recover supplies that had fallen into a river in Badghis Province on Nov. 4, news agencies reported.Shortly after the soldiers were reported missing, a Taliban spokesman said that militants had recovered the bodies of two drowned foreign soldiers. It was broadly assumed that the bodies were those of the missing soldiers. The recovery of the body of one soldier, identified by family members on a Facebook page as Benjamin Sherman, throws the Taliban claim into question.It was unclear how the military dive team located the soldier, or exactly where his body was found. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said it continued to search for the other missing soldier.Both were paratroopers with the Fourth Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division.A joint Afghan-American rescue mission that went to search for the soldiers last week was attacked by local Taliban forces. When an airstrike was called in by the Americans, at least seven Afghan soldiers and police officers were killed, as well as one civilian traveling with them, according to the Afghan Defense Ministry.NATO has not yet confirmed that an airstrike was responsible for the deaths. The alliance said it was investigating whether the airstrike killed people and whether it wounded five American soldiers as well as a number of Afghan servicemen at the scene.In the aftermath of the airstrike, local elders said they secured a promise from the Taliban not to attack the search party while it was trying to recover the bodies.'"

"'09-11-13,'1','The House ethics committee is openly — and foolishly — sniping at its newly appointed ally in the difficult task of policing members’ behavior. A recent ethics committee report exonerated an accused congressman but blistered the new semiautonomous Office of Congressional Ethics, or O.C.E., for “fundamentally flawed” procedures in vetting the complaint for the committee.The accusation appears groundless, but the lawmakers on the committee spent 30 pages displaying their resentment of the new office. This investment of resources would be far better focused on members’ behavior rather than the agency created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help the ethics committee shed its well-deserved reputation for inertia and evasion.At issue was the behavior of Representative Sam Graves of Missouri in asking a business associate of his wife to testify before the Small Business Committee. In clearing the congressman, the ethics committee attacked the O.C.E. for suggesting there may be “an appearance of a conflict of interest.” There is no explicit rule barring an appearance of conflict, the committee thundered, accusing the O.C.E. of trying to invent one.Wait a minute. The House does have an ethics standard mandating members behave “at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House.” Its ethics manual includes cautions against “appearance of impropriety.” The worrisome question now is whether the ethics panel has promulgated a loophole for flatly ignoring appearances of conflict of interest.The dispute might be dismissed as a turf fight, except fears are growing that opponents of the new ethics office might try and neuter it in a change of House rules next January.Nothing could be more foolhardy for lawmakers in desperate need of a cleaner ethics rating before the voters. Congressional scandal prompted creation of the O.C.E. Its positive effect in public accountability is already clear. The House needs it, however much some members sense a threat to the slothful prerogatives of the ethics committee.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','The Central Intelligence Agency did not violate the free speech rights of a former operative, Valerie Wilson, when it prohibited publication of details of her work before 2002 for the agency, a federal appeals court ruled. Ms. Wilson, left, whose classified status was exposed by Bush administration officials, redacted portions of her 2007 book, “Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House” because of the ban, but argued that the information was already in the public domain and publication should have been permitted. The opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, stated that “When Ms. Wilson elected to serve with the C.I.A., she accepted a life-long restriction on her ability to disclose classified and classifiable information.” Others may have disclosed it, and “may well have warranted investigation” for their disclosures, but “these circumstances do not absolve Ms. Wilson of her own secrecy obligations.” David B. Smallman, a lawyer for Ms. Wilson and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, said that an appeal was under consideration.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','’s antitrust and patent settlement with is good news for A.M.D., which now finds itself $1.25 billion richer, but it is less clear what it does for the general public. Intel has been accused of stifling competition and driving up prices through a wide array of anticompetitive practices, which may or may not continue now that Intel has agreed to write a large check. Government agencies that have sued Intel or are considering it should not back away.A.M.D.’s suit against Intel, which has been in the works for years, was supposed to be a major antitrust showdown. Instead, A.M.D. has agreed to call off the fireworks for a sum that means a lot more to A.M.D., whose stock price soared on the news, than to Intel. As part of the deal, Intel also agreed to adhere to some new business practices.Intel is the big gorilla of the microchip industry. Four out of five PCs in the world use its chips, which gives it an enormous amount of market clout that can be misused. Regulators have accused Intel of offering big rebates and co-marketing agreements to induce large computer makers to choose its chips over its competitors’ products.Intel’s behavior has drawn censure not just in the , but internationally. In May, the leveled a $1.45 billion fine on Intel for using illegal, anticompetitive practices. The European Union’s competition commissioner ordered Intel to change how it does business, including not offering rebates conditioned on the purchaser buying less of a competitor’s products, or not buying them at all. Intel is appealing the European Union ruling.This month, Attorney General of New York filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Intel, focusing in part on Intel payments to PC makers that are allegedly tied to the companies continuing to use Intel products. In announcing the suit, Mr. Cuomo charged Intel with using “illegal threats, coercion, fines and bullying to preserve its stranglehold on the market.” Based on what is known so far about the A.M.D. settlement, there is no reason for Mr. Cuomo to let up in that lawsuit.The Federal Trade Commission has also been considering opening formal proceedings against Intel. Like Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit, the focus of the F.T.C. investigation should be on what impact Intel’s actions have on consumers. Intel and its smaller rival, A.M.D., may well have reached an agreement that is good for both companies, but that does little for computer buyers.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Mary Mazzio’s “Ten9Eight: Shoot for the Moon,” a tirelessly inspirational documentary about teenagers competing in a nationwide business contest, is playing in seven cities in the theaters of one of its corporate sponsors, AMC Entertainment. (The screenings are tied to Global Entrepreneurship Week, which begins on Monday.) It’s the type of film you might expect to see at a fund-raising dinner or a convention banquet, not in a commercial theater. That said, it’s a very well-made piece of boosterism.The cryptic title refers to a statistic given at the start of the film: On average, a student drops out of high school somewhere in America every nine seconds. In response, the film offers role models that teenagers — the more motivated ones, anyway — can relate to. Its stars are drawn from the thousands of contestants in an annual competition sponsored by the nonprofit Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship. We see snippets of the business-plan presentations the students make to panels of executives, but mostly we hear life stories — drugs, foster care, immigration, language barriers — and testimonials.If every teenager were as charming, smart, funny and well-spoken as these, the world would be a better place. The film’s message is that any teenager, regardless of circumstances, can learn how to start a successful business, and for 84 minutes it’s pleasant to think that might be so.Opens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, Chicago, Miami and Atlanta.Directed by Mary Mazzio; director of photography, Richard Klug; edited by Paul Gattuso; music by Alex Lasarenko; released by 50 Eggs Films. Running time: 1 hour 24 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., practiced her short program here Thursday, looking fit and toned in black leggings and a black sleeveless top. The women’s event at Skate America begins Saturday, while competition in the other disciplines in this international figure skating event starts Friday.In an Olympic year when the United States women have no clear-cut favorite to make the team, Hughes may have returned at the right time.“It’s such an open field and this is a golden moment, a perfect moment for Emily to sign back up,” her coach, Bonni Retzkin, said. “She has as good a chance as anybody.”Cohen, the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, has not competed in three and a half years. Kimmie Meissner, another 2006 Olympian, is out with an injury.The other contenders to make the United States team — including the perky 17-year-old Rachael Flatt — are still trying to find their footing on the international stage of the senior level.At Skate America, Hughes will compete against Flatt, who finished fifth at the world championships last March, the top finish for an American woman.Hughes will also have the chance to test herself against South Korea’s Kim Yu-na, the reigning world champion. Kim, who broke her own scoring record this season, is the favorite to win the gold medal at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver.“Being seen at Skate America will be important because she’ll have the chance to show that she’s prepared and that she could put on a strong performance at the Olympics,” Kristi Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic champion, said of Hughes’s return. “If she has regained her performance levels that she had two years ago, then fantastic. But she’ll still need to prove herself at nationals.”All along, Hughes knew she would have to work hard to make this Olympic team — and that her skating work and her schoolwork could not mix if she wanted to succeed. For the last two years at Harvard, where she is majoring in government and sociology, she juggled college with skating. She trained in Massachusetts with the choreographer Elin Schran, who is the daughter of the 1956 Olympic champion Tenley Albright. She also worked with Retzkin long-distance.Around campus, Hughes said, she was just another student. One day, though, she found a photograph of herself in her physics textbook and pointed it out to her professor. That led to her demonstrating her spins for a class of 250 students.At the same time, though, Hughes’s connection to elite skating was slipping. There simply was not enough time in the day to balance both parts of her life, she recalled.The more packed her days became, the more her off-ice workouts suffered. Injuries kept her out of the last two national championships. But as the Vancouver Games approached, she found herself daydreaming of the Olympics.So, at the end of April, Hughes headed back to the rink with a purpose: making the United States team bound for Vancouver.“I realized that I love skating and competing so much that I couldn’t pass up this chance; I missed it so much,” she said, adding that she would have returned to competitive skating, no matter what her chances are to make the team.Her plan was to work her way to nationals by performing well at regionals and then sectionals.Last month, she was second at the North Atlantic Regional Championships and was preparing for next week’s Eastern Sectional Championships when the call came, summoning her to Skate America.“I’ve worked from the bottom up to the top to get here,” she said. “This is a huge leap that I’ve taken, but I’m ready for it.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Mike Sewak, who coaches Tech’s centers and guards, shook his head when asked about Bedford’s class load.“I can’t help him with his homework,” Sewak said.“Academic suicide,” said defensive end Derrick Morgan, a management major. “Look at those classes he takes. It’s sick, man.”Bedford is taking 12 hours this semester while starting for a 9-1 Georgia Tech team that can clinch a spot in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game with a win at Duke on Saturday. The Yellow Jackets and their spread option offense average 314.9 yards rushing a game, second best in the country. Right in the middle of it is Bedford, an undersize 274-pound center who began his career as a walk-on and was not awarded an athletic scholarship until last spring.“He’s a pretty squared-away guy, he’s got his priorities in order, he knows how to allot his time and he knows how to handle things,” Georgia Tech Coach Paul Johnson said. “He’s a smart guy, and it’s got to help him a little bit because he’s undersized and he’s not a great athlete. It’s probably one of his better attributes. He reminds me of the kids we had at the Naval Academy.”As a high school senior in Gainesville, Fla., Bedford was actually evaluated by Navy when Johnson coached there, but he did not make the cut. Bedford received offers from nonscholarship programs at Harvard, Penn, Carnegie Mellon and Georgetown before deciding to walk on at Georgia Tech. Bedford bears down in the football meeting room studying film, and opponents’ tendencies and schemes as if he were in his aerospace lab with an exam the next day.“Aerospace instills a work ethic in you, and if you ask my teammates they will tell you that I come out to practice with the idea that no one is going to match my effort and intensity,” Bedford said. “That carries over to my major because you have to study and work hard at this to have any chance at it. It’s not something that comes easily.”Sewak said Bedford was very detail-oriented.“When we give out tests on Fridays before a game, his answers are the more in-depth answers,” Sewak said. “He has a very good understanding where the ball is going and the principles and angles of where he needs to be and if this would occur, he should do this.”David Scarborough, a senior research engineer, teaches the jet and rocket propulsion class, full of terms like isentropic flow and stagnation states as well as adiabatic efficiency for the diffuser. Bedford sits in the front row.“He scored probably in the top 10 percent of the class on our first exam,” Scarborough said. “It is a very unusual to find a guy who can hang in aerospace engineering and play football. You will find guys who are brainiacs, but they don’t spend 20 hours a week in football and come do this work.”Bedford grew up infatuated with the United States space program. He built model rockets and went to space camps and had the aerospace track laid out as his future. Now, though, he is also considering law school and perhaps a career as an intellectual property lawyer.For the time being, he will have to put up with the heckling from people like his roommate, Tyler Evans, a management major and former football player. Evans will catch Bedford stressing over an exam and say, “Come on, Sean, it’s not like it’s ... oh, yeah, it is rocket science.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','“I’m not surprised that they’re gone,” said Susette Kelo, who moved to Groton from New London after the city took her home near Pfizer’s property. “They didn’t get what they wanted: their development, their big plan.”Ms. Kelo lived in a small pink house in the Fort Trumbull section that was square in the sights of city and state officials who wanted to revitalize the area. The city had created the New London Development Corporation to buy up the nine-acre neighborhood and find a developer to replace it with an “urban village” that would draw shoppers and tourists to the area.Economic development officials in Connecticut used that plan — and a package of financial incentives — to lure Pfizer to build a headquarters for its research division on 26 acres nearby. With an agreement that it would pay just one-fifth of its property taxes for the first 10 years, Pfizer spent $294 million on a 750,000-square-foot complex that opened in 2001.By then, Ms. Kelo, the Cristofaros and several neighbors had sued the city to stop it from using its power of eminent domain to take their property. The lawsuit, Kelo v. New London, wound up at the Supreme Court in 2005 as one of the most scrutinized property-rights cases in years.In a 5-to-4 decision, the high court ruled that it was permissible to take private property and turn it over to developers as part of a plan to bolster the local economy. Conservative justices, including Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Thomas called New London’s plan “a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation.”The decision was widely criticized, and spurred lawmakers across the country to adopt statutes to prevent similar uses of eminent domain. Scott G. Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group in Arlington, Va., said that 43 states had moved to protect private-property rights since the Kelo decision. New York and New Jersey are among the seven that have not, he said.Mr. Bullock, who represented the landowners in New London, said Pfizer’s announcement “really shows the folly of these plans that use massive corporate welfare and abuse eminent domain for private development.”“They oftentimes fail to live up to expectations,” he added.For its part, Pfizer said it had no stake in the outcome of the Kelo case nor any interest in the development of the land that was acquired by eminent domain, according to a statement provided by a spokeswoman, Liz Power.After Pfizer completed its $67 billion acquisition of Wyeth, another drug giant, in October, Ms. Power said, “We had a lot of real estate that we had to make strategic decisions about.” She said Pfizer would try to sell or lease its buildings in New London and would “continue to pay our taxes to the city as scheduled.”The complex is currently assessed at $220 million, said Robert M. Pero, a city councilman who is scheduled to become mayor next month. The company pays tax on 20 percent of that value and the state pays an additional 40 percent, Mr. Pero said. That arrangement is scheduled to end in 2011, around the time Pfizer, which is currently the city’s biggest taxpayer, expects to complete its withdrawal.“Basically, our economy lost a thousand jobs, but we still have a building,” Mr. Pero said. Then again, he added, “I don’t know who’s going to be looking for a building like that in this economy.”Some residents said they expected Pfizer to seek a revaluation of its buildings if they wind up vacant in two years; Ms. Power declined to comment.Mr. Pero said that he was offended that Pfizer did not notify city officials about the decision before Monday or give them a chance to argue against it or even fully understand it. But he said he did not regret the decisions he and other elected officials had made to bring Pfizer to New London for what they had hoped would be a long and fruitful stay.“I’m sure that there are people that are waiting out there to say, ‘I told you so,’ ” Mr. Pero said. “I don’t know that even today you can say, ‘I told you so.’ ”But Mr. Cristofaro and Ms. Kelo both said just that.Ms. Kelo, a nurse who works in New London and Norwich, Conn., said she was still bitter about the loss of her house, which she sold for $1 to Avner Gregory, a preservationist. Mr. Gregory dismantled the house and moved it across town. It now stands as a bright-pink symbol of the divisive dispute that drew so much attention to New London.“In all honesty, I’m not happy about what happened to me,” Ms. Kelo said. But, she added, “With 43 states changing their laws, in that sense I feel we did some good for people across the country.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','The study represents the first major news event, or catalyst in investor jargon, that could affect Merck earnings after the $41.1 billion merger the company completed last week with Schering-Plough.At stake are sales of Vytorin and Zetia, two cholesterol-lowering drugs that, even with the coming study factored in, are projected to bring in $4.5 billion in revenue for Merck in 2012, according to estimates from Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse. She forecast that in 2012, the cholesterol drugs would represent about $3 billion in profits, or about 17 percent of Merck’s projected total pretax profits of $17.4 billion.“This franchise is important from an earnings standpoint and a strategic standpoint,” Ms. Arnold said. “It wasn’t the crux of the merger of the two companies, but it was clearly a franchise both were interested in.”After the previous two studies raised questions about the drugs, sales of Vytorin and Zetia decreased to about $4.56 billion in 2008, compared with about $5.19 billion in 2007, according to a company regulatory filing. The decline occurred primarily in United States sales of the drugs.“It’s been such a controversial franchise that any bit of incremental data is going to get a lot of attention from the financial community,” said Chris Schott, an analyst with JPMorgan.In a note sent to investors this week, Mr. Schott estimated that, if the forthcoming study were to cause a sales drop in the cholesterol drugs, for every 10 percent reduction in American sales, earnings would drop by roughly 5 cents a share.Cholesterol medications have been a lucrative market for drug makers. But Zetia, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, has been controversial because it uses a different mechanism of action than statins, which have a longer track record. Vytorin, approved by the agency in 2004, is a medication that combines Zetia and a statin in one drug.Statins, like the world’s best-selling drug Lipitor from Pfizer, are drugs that work by inhibiting the production of LDL cholesterol in the liver. LDL is known as bad cholesterol because it can lead to plaque build-up in the arteries. Large-scale prospective studies have shown that statins can lower bad cholesterol and decrease heart problems.Zetia works by a different route, reducing bad cholesterol by blocking its absorption in the intestines. Taking Zetia alone typically lowers bad cholesterol by 18 percent, Merck said.But while Zetia has been shown to reduce bad cholesterol, it has not yet been proved to provide increased protection against problems like heart attacks and strokes, as statins have.Merck is currently conducting a large-scale clinical trial, that is to involve 18,000 people, intended to determine whether using Zetia provides an added cardiovascular benefit to people already on a statin. But the study is not expected to be completed until at least 2012.Dr. Richard Pasternak, vice president of Merck research laboratories, said that the drugs had proved to be safe and effective. It would be unfortunate, he said, if doctors were to change clinical practice based on unfair speculation about a study of 200 patients.The results of two earlier studies, intended to measure the effect of the drugs on problems like arterial wall thickening, an issue linked to heart problems, suggested that adding Zetia did not increase the cardiovascular benefit for patients.The new study is sure to further stoke the debate over whether, in the absence of definitive data, doctors should continue to prescribe expensive brand name drugs like Zetia and Vytorin, instead of inexpensive generic statins.“It was very unfortunate that this drug was introduced and became very popular without a large, well-designed study to look at whether it could reduce cardiovascular events,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.The new study was intended to examine the potential benefits of adding a second drug — either Zetia or niacin — to the treatment regime of people already taking a statin. Niacin can increase HDL cholesterol, known as good cholesterol because it is believed to scavenge bad cholesterol and remove it from the body. Researchers measured the differences in changes to arterial wall thickness in the two groups.“If you’re going to go to the expense, risk and trouble to take a pill every day to improve your longevity, don’t you really want to know if it works?” said Dr. Allen J. Taylor, a cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, in Washington, who led the study. He said he could not talk about the results until Monday.Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with the investment bank Leerink Swann, said he expected the study to favor niacin.But Mr. Schott of JPMorgan predicted that the fallout from the study — and, consequently, the impact on Merck’s bottom line — would be limited.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Tom McNulty, author of “Clean Like a Man: Housekeeping for Men,” which instructs men in the basics of housework — about changing sheets, for example, “Don’t wait until you can actually see that your bedding needs washing” — is impressed with the new ads.“It’s great,” said Mr. McNulty, who is incorporating recent studies that suggest men’s contribution to housework improves couples’ sex lives into “Clean Like a Man 2: The Relationship Edition,” a sequel. “This agency really is ahead of the curve, because I think women do have a fantasy about men cleaning.”Invented in 1929 by Harry A.

Now available in six scents other than pine, Pine-Sol had sales of $59.2 million in the 52 weeks ended Oct. 4, making it just barely the best-selling general cleaner over Lysol, a Reckitt Benckiser brand, with $58.5 million, according to Information Resources, a market research firm whose totals do not include Wal-Mart.The brand spent $18.9 million on advertising in 2008, and $10.8 million in the first six months of 2009, according to TNS Media Intelligence.The “heritage” pine scent remains the biggest seller, followed by lemon, said Hank Mercier, a Pine-Sol brand manager, adding that some customers keep several scents on hand.“They may clean with pine for a couple weeks, and that becomes the baseline scent of the house, and then they may switch things up a little and layer in a lemon that makes it smell different,” Mr. Mercier said.With all the scents, which tend to linger, “the idea is that our scent is proof of a job well done,” said Mr. Mercier.As for the latest campaign, Mr. Mercier said that the object was more to highlight the scent of the products than to satirize men’s unlikelihood to clean — or to fetishize them when they did.“What we were trying to do is play on the fantasy of perfume ads,” which also have strong romance elements, Mr. Mercier said. In the spots, in fact, Ms. Amos inhales rapturously with her eyes closed before even noticing the strapping swabbers.“Diane comes home and she is overcome with the scent of Pine-Sol and then that plays the rest of the way out with the gentleman mopping,” Mr. Mercier explained. “We certainly made the choice to have it be a man and fulfill a fantasy, but it’s not a comment on the societal pattern of men cleaning in the house.”Nor is the ad meant to sway men with a message that Pine-Sol will help them seduce women.“We know that men clean, but we certainly target women,” Mr. Mercier said. “They’re the ones making the purchases.”The brand’s Web site makes such targeting plain: Pine-Sol “has helped generations of moms to clean and disinfect their homes.”When Ms. Amos, who also performs in film and theater and as a stand-up comic, auditioned for a Pine-Sol commercial in 1993, she considered it a long shot.“I’m pretty much everything a commercial actress isn’t supposed to be,” she said. “I’m large, I have braids and I’m black — and at the time I had a space between my teeth.”When Pine-Sol hired her, the marketing “took a real-people turn,” Ms. Amos said. “I run a household and have kids. I look like I mop.”The new campaign is more fantasy-based than others, and the first for which she was outfitted in couture dresses.“This is me going into my inner glamour girl,” she said.Asked if those dresses are hanging in her closet now, Ms. Amos, who is approached by strangers who recognize her from the commercials on a nearly daily basis, laughed.“I’m working on that,” she said.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','For all its financial troubles and shortcomings as an automaker, no aspect of G.M. has confounded its critics as much as its hidebound, command-and-control corporate culture.When G.M. collapsed last year and turned to the government for an emergency bailout, its century-old way of conducting business was laid bare, with all its flaws in plain sight. Decisions were made, if at all, at a glacial pace, bogged down by endless committees, reports and reviews that astonished members of President Obama’s auto task force.“Everyone knew Detroit’s reputation for insular, slow-moving cultures,” Steven Rattner, head of the task force, wrote recently in Fortune magazine. “Even by that low standard, I was shocked by the stunningly poor management that we found.”G.M. will present its first postbankruptcy scorecard on Monday, when the company reports third-quarter earnings and its cash reserves. The company said on Nov. 3 that its financial health had “improved significantly” in recent months.Even as it labors to change its culture, G.M. must convince consumers that it is building better cars. One sign of its challenge: Fewer than a dozen of the company’s models were recommended in a recent Consumer Reports survey.But instead of playing down the survey, as G.M. might have in the past, its chief executive, Fritz Henderson, ordered it sent to every employee in the company.“Have we made some missteps? Yes,” said Susan Docherty, who last month was promoted to head of United States sales. “Are we going to slip back to our old ways? No.”G.M. emerged from bankruptcy this summer as a much smaller company, 60 percent owned by American taxpayers and free from much of the debt and health care obligations that had crippled its balance sheet.But its cultural change is a work in progress. G.M.’s new chairman, Edward Whitacre Jr., and directors have prodded G.M. to cut layers of bureaucracy, slash its executive ranks by a third, and give broad, new responsibilities to a cadre of younger managers.Replacing a binder full of job expectations with a one-page set of goals is just one sign of the fresh start, said Mr. Woychowski.“You know there’s not much good that comes out of a bankruptcy,” he said. “But it is a force that helps you change a culture.”Mr. Henderson, said he was aware the company was being scrutinized to prove it had learned from its mistakes. “Above all, we need to be faster,” Mr. Henderson said in a recent interview.Speed has never been G.M.’s forte. In 1988, when G.M. still dominated the United States market, a senior executive named Elmer Johnson wrote a stinging internal memo that summed up the company’s biggest problem.“We have not achieved the success that we must because of severe limitations on our organization’s ability to execute in a timely manner,” wrote Mr. Johnson.The memo fell on deaf ears, mostly because G.M.’s top executives prized consensus over debate, and rarely questioned its elaborate planning processes. A former G.M. executive and consultant, Rob Kleinbaum, said the culture emphasized past glories and current market share, rather than focusing on the future.“Those values were driven from the top on down,” said Mr. Kleinbaum. “And anybody inside who protested that attitude was buried.”But the shock of bankruptcy has prompted changes that would have been unheard-of in the old G.M.In the first week of August, Mr. Henderson told Jon Lauckner, the new head of global product planning, to scrap G.M.’s organizational chart for vehicle reviews and start over.In the old G.M., any changes to a product program would be reviewed by as many as 70 executives, often taking two months for a decision to wind its way through regional forums, then to a global committee, and finally to the all-powerful automotive products board.“I used to see the same presentation three times,” Mr. Lauckner said. “The first time it was interesting, the second time less so, and the third time it was just a transaction that needed to be done.”Mr. Lauckner came up with a new schedule that funneled all product decisions to weekly meetings of an executive committee run by Mr. Henderson and Thomas Stephens, the company’s vice chairman for product development.The new system was tested on Oct. 23, when Mr. Woychowski and Mark Reuss, the company’s new head of global engineering, asked the committee for a three-month delay in introducing the Chevrolet Cruze compact car.The delay, they argued, was needed to improve engine performance and the quietness of the Cruze’s ride — important areas of comparison with the segment-leading Honda Civic.“In the past, we might not have had the guts to bring it up,” said Mr. Reuss. “No one wanted to do anything wrong, or admit we needed to do a better job.”But to the relief of Mr. Reuss, the executive committee approved the delay. Soon after, he and other senior engineers were putting the Cruze through 80-mile-per-hour comparison tests with the Civic to close the competitive gap.In the past, G.M. rarely held back a product to add the extra touches that would improve its chances in a fiercely competitive market.“They used to have a budget and a time frame, and when it was exhausted, that was the finished product,” said Joseph Phillippi, a principal in the consulting firm Auto Trends Consulting. “I used to ask them, did you run out of money before you completed the interior?”G.M. executives used to take great offense to such remarks. Now, they concede that the company did produce inferior products.“I don’t even want to talk about what was ‘good enough’ anymore,” said Mr. Stephens, a career engineer who took over G.M.’s top product job last year. “You can’t win with good enough.”For two months, Mr. Stephens has been leading meetings with staff members called “pride builders.” The goal, he said, was to increase the “emotional commitment” to building better cars and encourage people to speak their minds.“If everybody is afraid to do anything, do we have a chance of winning?” Mr. Stephens said in one session last month.G.M. veterans recalled how product meetings used to be run according to a 50-page presentation that had already been read and approved in advance.At certain points, staff members were required to rate their assigned tasks as green, yellow or red, depending on whether the job had been completed, needed work, or should be frozen until a major problem was corrected.“If you had a red issue and stood up, it was very punitive,” said Mr. Reuss. “We never had any debate. The vice president would say, ‘I got here because I’m a better engineer than you, and now I’m going to tell you how bad a job you did.’ ”Mr. Reuss had been running G.M.’s Australia division when Mr. Henderson summoned him to Detroit in July to take over global engineering. Last month, he convened a two-day meeting with his top people from China, India, Brazil and other G.M. engineering centers around the world.They met at 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 15 in a parking lot at G.M.’s 4,000-acre proving grounds in Milford, a small town west of Detroit. Nine of G.M.’s newest vehicles were lined up for test drives to northern Michigan.But first, Mr. Reuss, wearing a red-and-black leather racing jacket, addressed the group.“There has been fear in the organization, and people have been afraid for their jobs,” he said. “But now we need to be open and transparent and trust each other, and be honest about our strengths and weaknesses.”As he drove north, Mr. Reuss, 45, reflected on his own career at G.M. He started as a student intern in 1983, and worked his way up the engineering ranks. One of his biggest assignments was serving as the executive in charge of one of the most ridiculed cars in G.M. history, the Pontiac Aztek.The Aztek was half-car, half-van, and universally branded as one of the ugliest vehicles to ever hit the market. Mr. Reuss had little to do with the design, but his job required him to defend it as if it were a thing of beauty.It was brutal, he said during an interview as he drove, to grit his teeth and pretend that the Aztek was something to be proud of.“It was something that flame-hardened me personally,” he said. “I’m in the ‘never again’ business. I wouldn’t wish that experience on anybody.”Mr. Reuss is also motivated by a deep desire to restore the respect G.M. has lost. His father, Lloyd Reuss, was fired in 1992 as G.M.’s president in the biggest upheaval the company ever experienced — until this year’s bankruptcy filing.“This is an opportunity my dad never had,” Mr. Reuss said. “I don’t want to waste it.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','The board of the United States Olympic Committee has appointed Paul Tagliabue, the former N.F.L. commissioner, to lead an independent panel that will examine whether the board, which has been criticized as being too insular, should change its governance structure.The announcement Thursday is the latest development in a year of turmoil at the U.S.O.C. Chicago lost its bid for the 2016 Olympics, the acting chief executive resigned after less than a year on the job and leaders of the national governing bodies of Olympic sports openly revolted.Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner from 1989 to 2006, will lead a committee that is charged with assessing the “size, structure and operating practices of the U.S.O.C. board,” according to a news release. In a conference call Wednesday, the board also agreed to publish all meeting agendas and board minutes, a change that critics had sought.“The board of the U.S.O.C. felt the time was right for an independent assessment of our governance structure, and we are extremely pleased that someone with Paul’s sport, business and leadership credentials is willing to take on this role,” the committee chairman, Larry Probst, said in a statement.In October, the executives of the governing bodies of Olympic sports called for the resignations of Probst and the acting chief executive, Stephanie Streeter. The same day, Streeter announced she would step down at the end of the year.Skip Gilbert, chairman of the Association of Chief Executives for Sport and one of the board’s most outspoken critics, praised Tagliabue’s appointment. “It’s a good step,” Gilbert said. “It’s something that we have been vocal about, and it’s reassuring to know that we’re moving forward.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','When Christopher Columbus first came to America, there were no natives on horseback to greet him. That is not only because he landed on an island in the Bahamas. It’s also because there were no horses in the New World. They originated here 40 million years ago and spread to other parts of the globe, but by 1492 horses had been extinct in the Western Hemisphere for 10,000 years. On his second trans-Atlantic voyage, in 1493, Columbus brought along 25 horses and reintroduced the species to America. Many more were brought later by French, English and Dutch colonizers.This is just one remarkable piece of information to be gleaned from “A Song for the Horse Nation,” an exhibition of 98 artifacts relating to native horse cultures, opening on Saturday at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in Lower Manhattan. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags adorned with equine imagery and much more, the exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history.Organized by Emil Her Many Horses, a curator at the museum, the show presents most of the artifacts, all from the Smithsonian’s collection, that were pictured in a small paperback of the same title published in 2006 (by the museum and Fulcrum Publishing). In his introduction the historian Herman J. Viola, a curator emeritus of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, tells of the rise and fall of American Indian horse culture, which thrived for only about 100 years.As Mr. Viola explains, scholars now believe that horses began to proliferate among Indians in the West after Spaniards in Sante Fe fled a Pueblo uprising in 1680, leaving behind hundreds of horses and other animals. At first the Indians were frightened and mystified by the large and unfamiliar creatures. They called it names like Big Dog and Big Elk. But by the time of the French and Indian War (1754-63), Plains Indians were among the world’s best horsemen. A century or so later, their horse culture was dead, a victim, as Mr. Viola put it, of “too many white people and too few buffalo.”As the exhibition’s many different sorts of artifacts show, the horse was much more than just a beast of burden. It was a highly efficient form of transportation, and it enabled Plains Indians to hunt buffalo, a primary source of food and material for clothing and shelter. So Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and other tribes were able to expand their territories and flourish.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Oreo, a pit bull mix, was hailed as a miracle dog when she survived being hurled off a Brooklyn rooftop last summer. She had two broken legs and a broken rib.Her owner was arrested on cruelty charges, and Oreo, a dark brown dog with white paws and forelegs and a white stripe down her forehead, was nursed back to health. Dozens of people expressed interest in adopting her.They will not get the chance. After overseeing her recovery, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has decided she has to be put to death. Oreo will be euthanized on Friday, according to the society’s president and chief executive, Ed Sayres.Oreo was almost impossible to control once her injuries healed, he said. Other officials from the society said Oreo had shown extreme aggressiveness during several behavioral examinations: growling, lunging and trying to bite people who came too close.Mr. Sayres called it a “most difficult and heartbreaking decision” but added that Oreo “is not able to do any of the companion things” a normal dog does. A specialist who had rated Oreo’s behavioral prognosis as poor in July downgraded it last month to grave  despite two months of daily sessions with a therapy team. A video of part of an October examination showed Oreo straining against her leash as if she wanted to charge another dog that passed by.Later in the video, Oreo bared her teeth at the camera and looked as if she was ready to attack.Oreo survived her plunge on June 18 from 28 West Ninth Street, a six-story apartment building in the Red Hook Houses complex. Several people called 911, and dispatchers sent agents from the society’s humane law enforcement department to investigate, said Stacy Wolf, the vice president and chief legal counsel of the humane law enforcement department.The agents took Oreo for treatment and, when no one came forward as her owner, returned to the complex to find out who owned Oreo, Ms. Wolf said. On July 30, the authorities arrested Fabian Henderson, 19, a resident of the Red Hook Houses. He pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court last month to a felony charge and will be sentenced on Dec. 1.The society never considered putting Oreo up for adoption in the conventional sense, to an ordinary household. She was a candidate for a “long-term resident facility,” a sanctuary where the society sends dogs it believes need more careful handling. Mr. Sayres said Oreo would have had to live out her life in seclusion, away from the other dogs and from people.“Her quality of life would have been reduced to virtually nothing,” he said.But some animal-care specialists questioned the decision to euthanize her. “The dog is a victim of cruelty,” said Nathan Winograd, a former director of operations for the San Francisco S.P.C.A., who has helped set up no-kill programs around the country. “It’s incredibly traumatized. It’s going to be fearful and distrustful and perhaps even in pain. Under those circumstances, even evaluating the dog right now is setting the dog up for failure.”He said the society should find “a skilled long-term foster care situation” and let Oreo go through “a rehabilitative process where the dog learns to trust people again, and then re-evaluate the dog.”Mr. Sayres said the society had not reached the decision about Oreo lightly  it even called in an outside veterinary behaviorist, E’Lise Christensen, for a consultation. She said that Oreo had “exhibited intense aggressive behaviors” during the evaluation, biting a fake hand that was dangled in front of her.Among other things, she wrote, “Oreo should not have any access to the public or uncontrolled areas outdoors. Oreo shouldn’t be around children.”Mr. Sayres said the society had evaluated dogs taken from Michael Vick, the football quarterback who served 18 months in federal prison for his role in a dogfighting ring. He said that fighting dogs normally have to be euthanized, but that 49 of the 50 Vick dogs “were immediately adoptable.”“There are no prejudgments,” he said in an interview. “We look at the actual behavior.”Society officials said a major factor in their decision to put Oreo to death was that she was unpredictable  so unpredictable that she even attacked her handler, someone she saw regularly. Oreo had to be kept in relative isolation for the safety of society employees and other dogs at the society’s headquarters at 424 East 92nd Street, between First and York Avenues.“Oreo’s aggression is triggered by, basically, everything,” Mr. Sayres said.'"
"'09-11-13,'1','“In the beginning, these accusations about Iran’s involvement were a joke,” said Muhammad al-Mutawakel, a professor at Sanaa University in Yemen. “But I’m afraid it will become serious. The Houthis already have weapons, and it is easy for Iran to provide them with the money they need to continue fighting Saudi Arabia and Yemen.”A battle between the Arab world’s leading Sunni power and Shiite Iran, even at one remove, could significantly elevate sectarian tensions across the region. Iran gained tremendous leverage over the Israeli-Palestinian problem by supporting the militant groups Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, in Gaza. Helping the Houthis, another guerrilla group with great staying power, could give them a way to put pressure on Saudi Arabia.Iran has long denied aiding the Houthis, who have been battling the Yemeni government intermittently for more than five years. On Tuesday, the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, affirmed that position, saying no country should “interfere in internal issues” in Yemen.But in recent months, Iran’s state-owned news media have been covering the Houthis’ struggle against the Yemeni military more intensively and more sympathetically than ever, setting off alarms across the region. Yemeni officials have accused the Houthis of receiving money from Shiite charities in Iran and elsewhere.Last month, the Yemeni government said it had intercepted an Iranian vessel carrying weapons in the Red Sea near where the Houthis are based. But Yemen has not supplied any evidence to back up that claim.In any case, the Houthis do not seem to need military supplies from outside the country. They have had no trouble buying or stealing them from Yemen’s military, which has struggled to maintain its morale and discipline in a region torn by tribal allegiances and largely beyond the control of the government.The Houthis’ decision last week to seize a strategic mountain area on the Saudi border — leading to a firefight in which a Saudi guard was killed — may have been a deliberate ploy to draw a powerful military response and elicit sympathy.“I think it was calculated,” said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst with the Gulf Research Center in Dubai. “The Houthis are under pressure, and they think bringing the Saudis into the conflict could bring them more attention, and maybe even draw the Iranians in.”The Houthis, who have a sophisticated communications operation, released a statement saying they had seized the border area, known as Jebel Dukhan, only because the Saudis had been allowing the Yemeni military to use it for attacks on them.In the past, the Saudis have avoided military force, preferring to use money and relationships with Yemeni tribal leaders to wield influence across the border. The Yemeni government has done the same thing in different ways, often setting tribes against one another or using them (and jihadists) as proxy forces.But those policies are problematic, too, and appear to have helped create the Houthi conflict in the first place. The Houthis have long complained that the Yemeni government — with encouragement from the Saudis — was marginalizing them in their home region and favoring hard-line Sunni fundamentalists.The Houthis’ grievances are rooted in religion and social class. The Houthis are Zaydi Muslims, whose beliefs are an offshoot of Shiite Islam. They make up perhaps a third of Yemen’s population and a majority in the north. The Houthis also belong to a subset of Zaydis that ruled northern Yemen for most of a millennium before the republican revolution in 1962. Ever since, Yemen’s insecure rulers have viewed the Zaydi elite with deep suspicion.The notion that the Houthis are natural religious allies of Iran is misplaced; Zaydism is doctrinally closer to Sunnism than to mainstream Shiism. But a raft of misleading news reports seem to be blurring that distinction, and circumstances may be pushing the Zaydis and Iran together. Or so their enemies fear.Yemen’s government, which accuses the Houthis of trying to restore the Zaydi imamate that ruled Yemen before 1962, launched a war against the rebels in August, with the goal of wiping them out. It is still possible that with the help of the Saudis and allied tribes, they may achieve that, or something close to it.The Saudis appear to have won significant victories in the past few days, and on Tuesday, Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi assistant defense minister, said the rebels “must withdraw dozens of kilometers” inside Yemen before the Saudi offensive would stop.Yemeni officials have sounded unusually confident notes in recent days, hinting that their own military is closing in on the Houthis from the south.But the experience of the past five years suggests otherwise. The Houthis started out with perhaps a few hundred fighters, and they have grown and gained allies over the years. The Saudis have enemies in the region, including a Yemen-based branch of Al Qaeda as well as Iran, and experts say if they are not careful, their border war could end up forging some toxic alliances.“For the Iranians, this could be a strategic investment that would cost little, but possibly have a big reward,” said Mr. Alani, the Dubai-based analyst. “The Houthis know the geography, they know how to do guerrilla warfare, and they have tribal connections. The Iranians will look at it closely.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','While Iraq’s imports nearly doubled in 2008, to $43.5 billion from $25.67 billion in 2007, imports from American companies stayed flat at $2 billion over that period. Among investors, the United Arab Emirates leads the field, with $31 billion invested in Iraq, most of that in 2008, compared to only about $400 million from American companies when United States government reconstruction spending is excluded, according to Dunia Frontier Consultants, a emerging-market analyst. “Following this initial U.S.-dominated reconstruction phase, U.S. private investors have become negligible players in Iraq,” Dunia said in a report.Indeed, even those companies that prospered during the war and occupation, including many of the big military contractors, will simply leave with the United States military as it completes its pullout over the next two years.KBR was among the earliest contractors in Iraq and has $33 billion in contracts to support American bases. Yet it has not had any contracts with the Iraqi government to support those facilities when they’re handed over — or for that matter, to build anything else in the country.“KBR is currently assessing the business environment in Iraq in order to make an informed decision regarding potential government contract opportunities there,” said a spokesperson, Heather Browne.A few big American multinationals, like Bechtel, will still be in the midst of long-term projects like power plants and waterworks — but those were five- and 10-year undertakings kick-started with American reconstruction aid.Now, Iraq is doling out its own oil-financed funds for capital projects, and American companies have so far received surprisingly little of it. Sports City, a billion-dollar complex of stadiums and housing in Basra planned for the Gulf Games in 2013, was awarded to an Iraqi general contractor, Al Jiburi Construction, over 60 other bidders, many of them American.“We have a couple American companies as our subcontractors,” said Adai al-Sultani, an assistant to the firm’s owner, with evident pride. When the transportation ministry put up more than $30 billion in railroad expansion contracts recently, they went to Czech, British and Italian companies.Those nations had been members of the coalition led by the United States, although all pulled outlong before the United States. But one of the biggest beneficiaries of Iraqi contract money is Turkey, which wouldn’t allow American warplanes to use its airbases during the invasion of Iraq, followed closely by Iran.Turkey has gone from almost no legal trade with Iraq before the war to $10 billion in exports last year, five times as much as the United States. Turkey’s trade minister, Kursad Tuzmen, predicted that number would triple in the next couple years.Both Turkey and Iran had huge pavilions at the trade fair, crowded with businessmen discussing deals. So did France and Brazil, also not coalition countries.Last month, FedEx, which had been flying packages in and out of Iraq since 2004, announced it was suspending its operations. The reason is that Iraqi officials gave RusAir, a Russian airline, exclusive rights to cargo flights.FedEx was one of the very few American businesses that braved the risks of working not only on American bases but also in the Red Zone, back when it was particularly dangerous to do so. Now that the danger is much less, its business is being thwarted by an upstart Russian come-lately.“FedEx Express has had no choice but to use Rus and, as a result, the reliability of our service to Iraq has been substantially degraded,” the company said in a statement about the suspension.It is almost an article of faith among many Iraqis, judging from opinion polls, that the United States invaded Iraq not to topple Saddam Hussein, but to get their country’s oil.If true, then the war failed in even more ways than some critics charge.It wasn’t until last week that the first major oil field exploitation contract was signed with a foreign company — BP, in a joint deal with China’s state-run China National Petroleum Corporation.Exxon Mobil, an American company, has an oil field deal awaiting final approval from Iraq’s oil ministry. The Italian oil giant Eni, whose junior partner is the American-owned Occidental Petroleum, is expected to sign a similar deal. These, however, are service contracts, so the foreign oil companies don’t actually own rights to any new oil they may find.The newest edition of the Iraqi Yellow Pages, a business-to-business directory, doesn’t have a single ad from an American company.American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the record, disputed that United States companies were having a difficult time in the Iraqi free market. “I wouldn’t read too much into American presence or lack of it at the trade fair as a bellwether,” one official said. “I would say the future is very positive.”Another official pointed out that a recent Iraqi-American investment conference held in Washington stirred up enormous interest among American companies. “We had to turn away several hundred companies that wanted to come,” he said, adding that the embassy in Baghdad has had many subsequent inquiries from firms. That interest has not translated into action yet.“After the conference in Washington, I’m surprised you can get on a flight here considering all the opportunities,” said Mike Pullen, a lawyer at the British-American firm DLA Piper, who works in Iraq.“It’s a pity we can’t get more people to come,” he said. “They’re losing out to Turkish companies, Russian companies.”“Turkish companies are acceptable to all different Iraqi ethnic groups, because they are not an occupier, and they can implement big reconstruction projects at a lower cost,” said an executive of a leading Iraqi construction firm that often works with the Turks. He did not wish to be identified for fear of offending American clients.Even Iraqi Kurds, many of whom are politically at odds with Turkey, seem to get along with the Turks when it comes to business.“Turkish companies are not afraid to do business in Iraq,” said Eren Balamir, who was in charge of Turkey’s pavilion at the fair.The high cost of security — a cost that most regional businesses don’t have — has dissuaded many American businesses from coming; some contracts spent as much as 25 percent of their budgets on security.Security isn’t the only impediment. Being seen as the occupier is just not good for business. Although the United States, legally speaking, has not been an occupying power since June 2004, when the Security Council formally ended occupation, many see it that way. Even Iraq’s prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has described Americans as occupiers to curry electoral support.One European ambassador, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his government’s policy, said his own country’s trade opportunities greatly increased in Iraq after it withdrew the last of its troops more than a year ago. “Being considered an occupier handicapped us extremely,” he said. “The farther we are away from that the more our companies can be accepted on their own merits.”“As a U.S. company, you already have a few strikes against you before you even step foot in Baghdad airport,” said Marc Zeepvat of the Trans National Research Corporation in New Jersey, who specializes in studying the Iraqi market for institutional investors. “The U.S. government and U.S. companies have to wake up and realize they’re not in a privileged position any more.”“The State Department’s travel advisory doesn’t help either,” Mr. Zeepvat said. It tells people, in effect, “don’t come.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Still, legal experts say the agreementresolves some of the antitrust issues surrounding Intel and could dissuade other government agencies from bringing cases against the company.The Federal Trade Commission, for example, has been investigating the big chip maker for the past year but has taken no action. “This private settlement has probably taken a lot of wind out of the sails” of the F.T.C.’s case, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the .The agreement between the two Silicon Valley companies mainly covers A.M.D.’s claims that Intel rewarded computer makers that used only Intel chips and punished those who bought from A.M.D. Intel contends that it never engaged in tactics to exclude A.M.D. from the marketplace but agreed in the settlement not to do so in the future.The pact provides for quarterly meetings between the companies and programs for mediating disputes over exclusionary practices. The firms will also cross-license each other’s patents for five years.But it’s unclear whether the deal will truly change the competitive dynamics between the companies. A.M.D., founded 40 years ago, rose to prominence as a maker of Intel-compatible chips, but it has had difficulty producing notably better products than Intel and often ended up in devastating price wars.Dirk Meyer, the chief executive of A.M.D., said the settlement opened the door to a “transformation in the way our industry operates,” though he admitted change would not be immediate.Thomas M. McCoy, A.M.D.’s executive vice president for legal affairs, said his company’s long-time goal had only been fair competition. “We’re not looking for any help, just do not hurt us,” he said.Intel executives said that settling the case was a pragmatic business decision, a careful weighing of risks.The jury trial in A.M.D.’s antitrust case against Intel was scheduled to begin in next spring. If things had gone against Intel, the chip maker could have been hit with triple damages, executives said.“We have never wavered in our position that Intel did nothing outside the law,” said Intel’s chief executive, . “It made sense to step back and find a way to settle this.”Michael Salinger, an economist at the School of Management and a former F.T.C. official, said the substantial settlement “suggests Intel knew they faced a serious risk of losing” in the A.M.D. trial.However, analysts said that the deal was unlikely to have a significant impact on how Intel did business.“A.M.D. did very well from this settlement, but Intel’s business model is not changing,” said Stacy Rasgon, a chip analyst at Bernstein Research.The Intel settlement with A.M.D. does not cover a range of business practices, including Intel’s broad pricing policies and its marketing payments to PC makers under its Intel Inside branding campaign.Those pricing and marketing practices have drawn the scrutiny of regulators worldwide.In May, the European Union hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine, which the company is appealing. And last week, New York’s attorney general, , filed a wide-ranging antitrust suit against Intel.Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the European Union’s competition commissioner, , said on Thursday that the settlement would have no effect on Europe’s case.“Intel has an ongoing obligation to comply with the commission’s antitrust decision and with E.U. competition law,” Mr. Todd said. “The commission continues to vigorously monitor Intel’s compliance with its obligations under the E.U. antitrust decision.”A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo’s office said its suit against Intel also was continuing.Intel and A.M.D. said that talks to end their disputes began in April, but negotiations got serious over the summer, after the Europeans ruled against Intel. Mr. Otellini said New York’s suit had no effect on the timing of the deal, although the state’s investigation began last year.The final negotiating point, Mr. Otellini said, was how much Intel would pay A.M.D. He said it pained him to write a big check, but $1.2 billion might be a “small multiple” of the company’s liability if it lost a jury trial.Intel and A.M.D. have wrangled legally for more than two decades, and A.M.D. has been the primary instigator behind various government investigations of its rival over the years. By now, the two sides have exchanged 200 million documents, and witness depositions run to 2,200 hours — all of which are available to government investigators.Besides cash, the settlement gives A.M.D. greater freedom to produce chips at different contract factories around the world. Under a patent cross-licensing deal with Intel, A.M.D. was restricted in producing large volumes of chips in any factory not owned by A.M.D. or a subsidiary.That part of the agreement, analysts say, could eventually allow A.M.D. to reduce its stake in its former chip-making operations, which in March were spun off into a money-losing joint venture called Globalfoundries. In the third quarter, A.M.D. had operating income of $47 million, excluding the losses from Globalfoundries, on revenue of $1.4 billion.“A stronger A.M.D. is good for competition in the industry,” said Mr. Rasgon. “The impact will depend on how well A.M.D. does in developing and producing products over time.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','“I think both of them, their moves, have been perfectly calculated,” he added. He was referring to Mr. Thaksin and to his host, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, who appeared to be using the visit to tweak his counterparts across the border.Mr. Pavin said that if Mr. Thaksin could show the public that the Thai government “is incapable and unable to solve this crisis, then this will be a slap in the face of the government and will raise questions about the legitimacy of the government.”Mr. Thaksin’s visit has escalated a confrontation between the nations that began with a dispute in 2008 over sovereignty at the Preah Vihear temple, where the two armies have fought several bloody skirmishes and remain on alert.The two nations recalled their ambassadors last week after Mr. Hun Sen announced the appointment of Mr. Thaksin as an “economic adviser,” and Thailand said it would scrap an agreement governing negotiations over disputed offshore oil and gas deposits.In its diplomatic note rejecting the demand for Mr. Thaksin’s extradition on Wednesday, the Cambodian government noted, in capital letters, that he had been forced from office although he had been “OVERWHELMINGLY and DEMOCRATICALLY elected by the Thai people.”On Thursday both nations expelled an additional diplomat in a tit-for-tat escalation of the diplomatic row.Mr. Hun Sen may be looking to his own long-term interests and placing a bet on Mr. Thaksin as the future leader of Thailand, Mr. Pavin said.In Thailand, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and his Democrat Party remain politically weak, and many analysts say that supporters of Mr. Thaksin would be likely to win any new election.Mr. Hun Sen, who greeted Mr. Thaksin on Monday with an embrace and a vow of “eternal friendship,” seemed to taunt Mr. Abhisit, who took office in a parliamentary vote last December, with the backing of the military and without a popular vote. He was an indirect beneficiary of the coup that ousted Mr. Thaksin.“If Abhisit is so capable, why not dissolve the Parliament and call for a new election?” Mr. Hun Sen asked Wednesday. “What is he afraid of? I am the prime minister of Cambodia who received two-thirds of the vote, and how many votes did Abhisit receive? Or did he steal his seat from other people?”Mr. Hun Sen, 58, and Mr. Abhisit, 45, come from different worlds, the former raised as a barefoot temple boy who took up arms for the Khmer Rouge, the latter an Eton and Oxford man, fluent in English and in Western ways.If Mr. Thaksin’s intention was to discomfit the Thai government and keep himself on the front pages of newspapers at home, he seems to have succeeded.“Rejected!” read a banner headline, in red type, in The Nation, a daily newspaper, on Thursday, referring to Cambodia’s refusal to extradite Mr. Thaksin.Filling most of the front page under the headline was a facsimile of Cambodia’s diplomatic note, with its capitalized reference to the “ABSOLUTE REALITIES” of Thai politics and an implication of Mr. Thaksin’s legitimacy as prime minister.The newspaper also printed Mr. Thaksin’s schedule in Cambodia for the next few days: a visit to the ancient temples at Angkor, a round of golf with Mr. Hun Sen and possibly a meeting with supporters bused in from Thailand.After that, renewing the mystery that Mr. Thaksin has cultivated, the schedule simply noted, “Depart Cambodia for an unknown destination.”'"
"'09-11-13,'1','Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., practiced her short program here Thursday, looking fit and toned in black leggings and a black sleeveless top. The women’s event at Skate America begins Saturday, while competition in the other disciplines in this international figure skating event starts Friday.In an Olympic year when the United States women have no clear-cut favorite to make the team, Hughes may have returned at the right time.“It’s such an open field and this is a golden moment, a perfect moment for Emily to sign back up,” her coach, Bonni Retzkin, said. “She has as good a chance as anybody.”Cohen, the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, has not competed in three and a half years. Kimmie Meissner, another 2006 Olympian, is out with an injury.The other contenders to make the United States team — including the perky 17-year-old Rachael Flatt — are still trying to find their footing on the international stage of the senior level.At Skate America, Hughes will compete against Flatt, who finished fifth at the world championships last March, the top finish for an American woman.Hughes will also have the chance to test herself against South Korea’s Kim Yu-na, the reigning world champion. Kim, who broke her own scoring record this season, is the favorite to win the gold medal at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver.“Being seen at Skate America will be important because she’ll have the chance to show that she’s prepared and that she could put on a strong performance at the Olympics,” Kristi Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic champion, said of Hughes’s return. “If she has regained her performance levels that she had two years ago, then fantastic. But she’ll still need to prove herself at nationals.”All along, Hughes knew she would have to work hard to make this Olympic team — and that her skating work and her schoolwork could not mix if she wanted to succeed. For the last two years at Harvard, where she is majoring in government and sociology, she juggled college with skating. She trained in Massachusetts with the choreographer Elin Schran, who is the daughter of the 1956 Olympic champion Tenley Albright. She also worked with Retzkin long-distance.Around campus, Hughes said, she was just another student. One day, though, she found a photograph of herself in her physics textbook and pointed it out to her professor. That led to her demonstrating her spins for a class of 250 students.At the same time, though, Hughes’s connection to elite skating was slipping. There simply was not enough time in the day to balance both parts of her life, she recalled.The more packed her days became, the more her off-ice workouts suffered. Injuries kept her out of the last two national championships. But as the Vancouver Games approached, she found herself daydreaming of the Olympics.So, at the end of April, Hughes headed back to the rink with a purpose: making the United States team bound for Vancouver.“I realized that I love skating and competing so much that I couldn’t pass up this chance; I missed it so much,” she said, adding that she would have returned to competitive skating, no matter what her chances are to make the team.Her plan was to work her way to nationals by performing well at regionals and then sectionals.Last month, she was second at the North Atlantic Regional Championships and was preparing for next week’s Eastern Sectional Championships when the call came, summoning her to Skate America.“I’ve worked from the bottom up to the top to get here,” she said. “This is a huge leap that I’ve taken, but I’m ready for it.”'"

While I.S.T. may be a great political sound bite, it is not a panacea for security.Using Clorox’s business decision as an example further illustrates the oversimplification of product-switching that proponents of this bill continue to espouse.Manufacturing bleach still requires the use of chlorine gas; it just won’t occur at Clorox facilities.Chemical security requires more than the superficial approach being taken by activists and politicians. Complex processes requiring the use of specific chemicals are governed by the laws of physics, not politics and emotion; the decisions involved require engineering expertise that the government and Greenpeace do not have.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','“For decades, Astoria has been waiting in the wings to become the next Manhattan,” said George Halvatzis, a real estate agent whose Ditmars Boulevard office Donut passes during his daily constitutionals. “We have been getting trendy restaurants and trendy shops, but more than anything, the Frenchies, which are so Manhattanesque, may be the signal that this is finally starting to happen.”Mr. Halvatzis, who owns a shar-pei named Chopper, said the breed was perfect for apartments. “Because of the weak economy, landlords have gotten more lax about taking dogs,” he said. “And French bulldogs are just the right size and temperament for smaller spaces.”The dogs have another landlord-endearing quality: “They don’t bark,” said Luke Herman, who, with his wife, Natalia Lyons, owns Jack. “They have their own language of yodels, screams, chirps, warbles and what can best be described as snorfles.”JoAnn and Matt Franjola, owners of Romeo, say he is the perfect companion for their 3-month-old son, Chase. “They’re fabulous together,” Ms. Franjola said. “Romeo licks his toes, and if the baby cries, Romeo runs up to me and stares as if to say, ‘Are you going to get that?’ ”The only thing better than one Frenchie, say Givanni Ildefonso and Jose Sandin, is two. Coco and Samantha, sisters whose fall wardrobe includes matching brown and pink hoodies that complement their fawn bodies and black masks, have turned their owners into celebrities. “We meet new people every night,” Ms. Ildefonso said. “And people always say: ‘Wow! They’re twins. How do you tell them apart?’ ”Astoria Frenchie owners dismiss the idea that the dogs are status symbols and emphasize that they require as much tender loving care as children. They can develop breathing and respiratory problems because of their short, pressed-in faces, and are prone to joint diseases, spinal disorders and heart defects.“There’s an immense commitment, financially,” says Josh Flanagan, whose 2-year-old George Clooney is among the original Astoria Eight. “I’ve heard that over the life of the dog, it could cost $40,000 in veterinarian bills, premium food and general upkeep. My wife, Lindsay, and I love ours to death, but I don’t know if we’d get another.”Astoria’s fascination with the breed can be traced back four years to the first Oscar, a high-fashion fawn who wore a red bandana around his neck. His owner, a tall, ponytailed man who was said to have been an opera singer, taught Oscar to walk at his side, leashless, and to wait for him outside the shops on 31st Street.Oscar moved to the West Coast, Donut has since taken up the golden leash, and the new Oskar, with his darling doggie-in-the-window routine, has turned the Jumping Bulldog into a French bulldog franchise.Dogs and owners have become fast friends, so much so that Ms. Firrigno was considering holding Frenchie Fridays at the shop for some off-leash playtime.“You can’t be a Frenchie owner and be antisocial,” Ms. Mara said. “There’s a special bond between Frenchie owners. It’s like a club.”Mr. Herman agreed, adding that those in the Frenchie fraternity “recognize the dogs but sometimes not the people. But we have developed social relationships with some of the owners, and sometimes we even hang out without the dogs.”There is also a special bond between the pets. Jack, Oskar and Donut, for instance, have become fast friends.“I can’t imagine not ever having a Frenchie,” Ms. Lyons said. “Someday, I would like to get a little sister for Jack.”Jack looked up at her and smiled like a clown. On command, he gave Mr. Herman a high-five with his petite paw, and they continued down the street.“Oh, that’s so cute,” a woman cooed as she knelt to pet his head. “What kind of dog is that?”'"
"'09-11-14,'0','Local efforts, said the group’s founder and chairman, Sean T. McAllister, are now organizing or under way in two other Colorado resort towns, Durango and Aspen. After the election, Mr. McAllister said, people in Montana and Washington called seeking advice on starting voter initiatives.Breckenridge’s part-time mayor, Dr. John Warner, a dentist who voted against the measure but remained publicly neutral before the election, said the three dozen or so e-mail messages he had received since the vote had been mixed.About half of the messages were negative, Dr. Warner said, and included comments from people who said they had canceled reservations and would never come back. Other respondents said they were thrilled about the town’s vote and could hardly wait to visit and spend some money.State and federal law still make marijuana possession a crime in Colorado, but residents here say that local enforcement has not been a high police priority.A spokeswoman for the Breckenridge Resort Chamber of Commerce, Carly Grimes, said she thought that because of those other laws, little would change. But she said that some chamber members were concerned about perceptions — that the statute could send a message of broader drug tolerance that could turn off visiting families, who remain a cornerstone of the economic base.“This is not going to become a little Amsterdam,” she said, referring to the Dutch capital, an international symbol of libertarian drug use.At Vail Resorts, a publicly traded company that owns the Breckenridge resort, a spokeswoman said she expected no change in management practices.The spokeswoman, Kelly Ladyga, said that resort employees were already trained to be “hypervigilant” in watching people for dangerous behavior from drugs or alcohol and that the company reserved the right to test any employee for drugs if “reasonable suspicions” are raised or an accident occurs.“We’re a family-friendly resort, and together with the town we remain committed to delivering an exceptional guest experience,” Ms. Ladyga said. “Boarding a lift or using a slope or trail while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited.”At Home for the Holidays, a year-round Christmas store, the manager, M. Musso, who asked that only her first initial be used, said her customers tended to be older and more conservative. The young and the rowdy, who crowd the bars when the lifts close, usually do not shop for Christmas baubles, she said.“I don’t think that’s the type of person we want flocking into Breckenridge,” said Ms. Musso, who opposed the ordinance.But it is also easy to find people like Chelsey Vogt, a 21-year-old snowboarder originally from upstate New York who foresees what she calls change for the better — from local marijuana users’ becoming more open and comfortable to pot-smoking visitors drawn by the town’s new stance.“It’s been here forever,” said Ms. Vogt, who works for a property maintenance company when not on the mountain. “Now people can just be more comfortable walking down the street having some marijuana in their pocket — definitely including me.”One Town Council member who supported the ballot measure, Jeffrey J. Bergeron, said he thought history had played a role in assembling a majority of voters. Mr. Bergeron, who has lived in Breckenridge for nearly 30 years, said many longtime residents vividly remembered the 1970s and 1980s, when cocaine use became a rage and then a scourge, destroying lives and businesses before fading in the 1990s. Through that lens, he said, marijuana looks comparatively benign.But Mr. Bergeron said he had not expected a backlash, and he now worries that business could take a hit.“It was a gesture in the right direction,” he said. “I just wish some other town had done it.”Whether the new measure will lead to more accidents on the slopes is anyone’s guess.Colorado is one of the few states whose legal codes specify that collisions between skiers are not a natural risk of the sport. The provision, passed by the legislature in 1990, imposes what lawyers call a higher standard of care and potential legal liability upon skiers who cause accidents than do most other states with big resort industries.James H. Chalat, a lawyer in Denver who specializes in personal injury and ski cases, said that of the hundreds of lawsuits stemming from skiing accidents handled by his firm, Chalat Hatten & Koupal, over 29 years, marijuana had been a factor in only one collision between two skiers.Alcohol, on the other hand, has often been an aggravating cause, with a drunken skier or snowboarder plowing into somebody else, causing injury.In any accident, though, evidence of marijuana use would be looked at. “If somebody is stoned, that’s not helpful,” Mr. Chalat said. “It’s a dumb thing.”'"
"'09-11-14,'0','As a result, Mr. Obama can expect to get an earful from Chinese officials not only on the Dalai Lama, whom the president says he will meet after the China trip, but also on Taiwan, the self-governing island that China says is a rebel province. Taiwan receives annual arms shipments from the United States.“Tibet and Taiwan are, from China’s perspective, the two core sovereignty issues, and they rank above all others in Chinese diplomacy,” said David Shambaugh, a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Disputed territory is also the biggest obstacle in relations between China and its largest neighbor, India. On Tuesday, Mr. Qin denounced the Dalai Lama for his visit this week to the Tibetan Buddhist enclave of Tawang in the Indian Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh.Tawang is one of the most potent symbols of China’s unresolved sovereignty issues. China says it was once part of Tibet, which the Chinese military seized in 1951, and so belongs to Beijing. India says that Tibetan leaders ceded it to British-ruled India in a 1914 treaty. Tawang figured centrally in a border war between China and India in 1962.Part of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the notion, rightly or wrongly held, that it ousted foreign influence from the country and has tried to reunite fragments of China to return the boundaries of the modern nation to roughly those of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) at its height. That includes Taiwan, Tibet, the western region of Xinjiang and, by China’s calculation, Tawang.“In most respects, the People’s Republic of China, of course, inherits the fixed boundaries of its predecessor nation-state, the Republic of China, which declared as its territorial boundaries what had been mostly the messy frontiers of the Qing empire,” Alice Miller, a historian and research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in a China discussion forum posting that she agreed to make public.“Messy” is the operative word here. In the age of empires, there were no hard and fast borders, whether the imperial rulers were the Ottoman Turks or the Manchus or the Moghuls. The seat of empire had its sphere of influence, radiating outward, with tributary states occupying the borderlands but rarely being governed in the same way as regions within a modern nation today.Trying to define national borders along the contours of an old empire is a daunting task. If, for example, Tibet paid tribute to the Qing emperor at certain points in history, should Tibet be part of modern China? If Tawang did the same with Tibetan rulers in Lhasa, should Tawang be part of modern Tibet?Along with India and Indonesia, China is one of a handful of vast, multiethnic nations that follow the contours of fallen empires. Because of their size and history, all three nations grapple with the same issues: border disputes, ethno-nationalism, occasionally violent movements by disaffected ethnic or religious minorities.China is often criticized as handling uprisings harshly in Tibet and Xinjiang, which the country’s ethnic Han leaders consider internal issues of sovereignty. But in dealing with its neighbors on territorial issues, China has in the recent past generally sought to settle conflicts through negotiation, scholars say.Since 1949, it has resolved 17 of 23 border disputes, offering concessions in 15 of those instances and, over all, receiving less than half of the contested territory, said M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M.I.T. The compromises have generally come at times of regime instability, when the Communist Party has felt threatened by external or internal forces, he added.The big question, then, is whether Chinese leaders will continue to show flexibility on border issues as China becomes a greater world power, and as it stamps out internal threats.China’s maritime disputes have proven harder to settle than those on land. In the resource-rich seas to its east and south, China is trying to assert control of various islands — most notably the Spratly, Paracel and Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands — that are also claimed in whole or in part by other Asian countries. In March, official Chinese news organizations reported that the government intended to send six more patrol vessels to the South China Sea in the next three to five years.Even the United States has run directly afoul of China’s maritime border claims: On March 8, five Chinese vessels harassed an American surveillance ship in what Pentagon officials said are international waters. The Chinese insisted that the American ship, the Impeccable, was conducting illegal surveillance in waters under their jurisdiction.Dennis C. Blair, the national intelligence director, told Congress that China’s general behavior in the South China Sea was “more military, aggressive, forward-pushing than we saw a couple of years before.”This all speaks to how a bolder, brasher China might handle issues of sovereignty and territory, comparisons to Abraham Lincoln notwithstanding.“The biggest unknown is how a stronger China will behave in its outstanding disputes,” Mr. Fravel said. “When it has compromised in the past, mostly in disputes on its land border, it was a relatively weak state. The question now becomes: how will a stronger China behave in its remaining territorial disputes over maritime sovereignty and with India?”'"
"'09-11-14,'0','The federal agency that assesses health hazards at sites designated for Superfund environmental cleanups said Friday that it had reversed its conclusion that contamination at a former United States Navy training ground in Puerto Rico posed no health risks to residents.As a result, it said, it plans to recommend monitoring to determine whether residents of the island of Vieques, the site of decades of live fire and bombing exercises, have been exposed to harmful chemicals and at what levels.“Much has been learned since we first went to Vieques a decade ago, and we have identified gaps in environmental data that could be important in determining health effects,” Dr. Howard Frumkin, director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, said in a statement posted on the agency’s Web site late Friday afternoon. “The gaps we found indicate that we cannot state unequivocally that no health hazards exist in Vieques.”In a finding in 2003, the agency had said that levels of heavy metals and explosive compounds found in Vieques’s soil, groundwater, air and fish did not pose a health risk.The action on Friday is a vindication of the 9,300 residents of the small island off the mainland of northeastern Puerto Rico, who are pursuing claims against the United States government for contamination and illnesses. Puerto Rico’s health department has found disproportionately high rates of illnesses like cancer, hypertension and liver disease on the island. In their claims, residents assert that the illnesses are linked to pollutants released in Navy exercises that continued until 2003.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','France recorded a more muted rebound during the same period. Its G.D.P. grew 0.3 percent — the same increase as was reported during the second quarter. Analyst had expected it to grow by 0.6 percent.In Italy, G.D.P. grew 0.6 percent. Spain, struggling with a deep housing market correction and the highest unemployment rate in the region, remains in recession; its economy contracted 0.3 percent.The data were preliminary, with further details to be published later in the month.But the German numbers appear to have been bolstered by an acceleration in industrial production, which was up 3.5 percent in the third quarter from the previous period, and exports, which rose 5.4 percent during the third quarter despite the stronger euro.Germany, noted for its value-added manufactured goods like machine tools, chemicals and high-end automobiles, appears to be better positioned than France to gain from the stronger growth in emerging countries.The French recovery was also helped by higher exports, although household consumption leveled off.The French rebound “is still rather weak and reliant upon the stimulus package put in place by the authorities,” Oscar Bernal, an ING analyst, said.“Only public spending is likely to keep sustaining growth in the next quarters,” he added.Simultaneously, there is a danger that European authorities will soon pressure France to limit spending to control its rising public deficit and debt ratios, analysts say.For the 27 members of the full European Union, the G. D.P. grew in the third quarter by a more modest 0.2 percent, Eurostat said.The British economy, in particular, is lagging behind its neighbors. Britain’s G.D.P. contracted by 0.4 percent in the July-to-September period from the previous three months, and it shrank by 5.2 percent compared with a year earlier.A significant reason for the divergent performance between the economies appears to be the larger debt burden of British consumers.The American economy also recovered from recession during the third quarter; the country’s G.D.P. expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent. By comparison, on an annualized basis, the euro area economy grew by about 1.6 percent during that period.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','Swiss officials said Friday that they had sued Google to try to require it to tighten privacy safeguards on its Street View online service. It is the latest of a series of European objections to the company’s handling of personal information.The Swiss data protection authority said it had filed a complaint with the Federal Administrative Court after Google balked at its demand for additional measures to make obscure the images of people who appear in Street View, particularly in areas around hospitals, schools and prisons.Street View provides ground-level panoramas of streets across the United States, Europe and other regions, searchable via Google’s mapping service. Google compiles the scenes with camera-equipped cars.Google already blurs the faces and license plates that appear in Street View. Users of the service can also request that certain images, like their homes, be removed or blurred.Google said it had met with the data protection commissioner, Hanspeter Thür, before the introduction of the Swiss version of Street View and received “the green light to launch the product” in August. After the authorities raised objections, Google said it had offered other protective measures, but said the commissioner rejected them as inadequate.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','The outcome will hinge on the answer to a technical question: do the fees reflect what it costs the airlines to provide the extra service, or are they just an added charge for services the airlines have always provided?The airlines prefer a different metaphor, and say these fees are akin to an à la carte restaurant menu, allowing passengers to choose what they want as part of their trip.But to Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, who has long followed industry issues, fees mean only one thing: “They’ve found a backdoor way to raise ticket prices.”He and Representative Jerry F. Costello, Democrat of Illinois, have asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the practice. The office’s first meetings with airlines began last month, and Mr. Oberstar said he expected to hold Congressional hearings for airline executives to justify the fees.So far this year, United States airlines have taken in more than $3 billion in fees. If all those fees were subject to the same 7.5 percent excise taxes as fares, then the government would have at least $225 million more to distribute to airports for improvements and expansions.Airline executives said they were cooperating fully with the Congressional investigation, but were concerned that it might result in even higher prices for consumers, who are already paying an average of $10 each in baggage and other fees, which the airlines call ancillary revenue.“It falls in the category, first, do no harm,” said David Castelveter, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry’s trade group.But Mr. Oberstar says airlines may be doing themselves long-term harm. The money collected from excise taxes is a primary source of federal financing for airports, which ultimately helps both the airlines and their customers.“Maybe we have to teach them a lesson, and make them pay their fair share,” Mr. Oberstar said of the airlines.The airlines counter that the recession has forced them to think up new revenue streams. This fall, for example, they began adding a surcharge on tickets booked during the most popular travel days during Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring break.“We have been aggressive and creative,” John Tague, president of United Airlines, told analysts last month. And it has paid off: United collects about $13 in fees per passenger, or 30 percent more than the industry average.Collectively, the nine biggest airlines lost $236 million between July and September, which is usually the strongest quarter for travel during the year, according to Airlinefinancials.com, which tracks industry trends.Along with the overall drop in travel, revenue from business travelers, a major source of income for United and other carriers, was down 25 percent in the third quarter, after falling 40 percent earlier this year.“There’s no opportunity here for a full revenue recovery until we get premium travel back,” Mr. Tague said. “And it’s not clear how long that will take.”Southwest Airlines has been a holdout in charging many fees. So far, it has not started charging to check the first two bags, although it is exploring ways to collect more revenue from passengers when it overhauls its frequent-flier program.“We all know if we charged money, we’d get the bag fee, but we’d lose the customer,” its chief executive, Gary Kelly, said last month. “We believe we’re ahead of the game by not charging a bag fee.”Robert W. Mann, an industry analyst, said airlines were making a mistake by giving passengers another reason to resent them, and by creating a new incentive for them to search harder for the lowest possible fare.He added that the airlines should have been clearer on their Web sites and in their ads about the charges for things that were once included in the ticket price.“There’s a right way, and a wrong way, and the wrong way is what the airlines have done,” Mr. Mann said.Mr. Mann got his own fee surprise when he flew JetBlue Airways from Orlando to New York in October.He arrived early at the airport, and asked to rebook his flight. He was told he could do so for $40. The aisle seat he wanted cost him another $25.“It’s different than buying a car, and adding on the options packages,” he said. “It’s almost as if airlines have turned this on its head and said, ‘We’ll sell you the Toyota, but the four tires are extra.’ ”'"

On the upside, the debut of the highly anticipated shooting game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 set a sales record for the industry, Variety reported: the game, which retails for $59.99, sold 4.7 million units in its first day on sale in the United States and Britain, taking in $310 million for the game publisher Activision Blizzard. (By comparison, the year’s highest-grossing movie, “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” had earned more than $200 million domestically by the end of its first weekend.) On the downside, the industry saw its overall sales decline during October, compared with the same month last year, according to a report from NPD Group. Sales of hardware, software and accessories totaled $1.07 billion for October 2009, down 19 percent from the $1.32 billion in sales in October 2008. NPD predicted that the industry’s revenues for the year would be from $20 billion to $21 billion, most likely down from last year’s tally of $21.3 billion, though coming releases like New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Assassin’s Creed 2 could still turn things around.'"

Mr. DeLaughter, 55, pleaded guilty in July to obstruction of justice. He admitted lying to an F.B.I. agent during a judicial corruption investigation.

"'09-11-14,'0','How much you enjoy “Inside Out,” the moody blend of modern and traditional circus by the Swedish troupe Cirkus Cirkör depends to a large degree on whether you’ve recently seen Cirque du Soleil. This tastefully appointed spectacle, which imagines two risk-averse ordinary people loosening up upon meeting a talented troupe of acrobats, jugglers and clowns, once again polishes up sideshow antics with an arty sheen. But next to similar efforts by Cirque du Soleil, a French Canadian juggernaut that is a frequent visitor to this city, this new production can seem beside the point. By comparison, the bag of tricks of Cirkus Cirkör’s jittery ringleader (Fredrik Deijfen, looking like Jeeves dipped in white paint) is skimpy, the show’s pacing slack, and the leaps and stunts awfully modest.When the drumroll builds expectations for the big finale, where a seesaw launches performers into the rafters, I couldn’t help wondering what all the fuss was about. Cirque serves up this kind of thing as an appetizer, not the main course. And its performers fly twice as high.Since the market for circus arts in this city is as crowded as a clown car, you have to wonder about the reasoning behind programming this show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The annual Spiegeltent found its niche by counterprogramming a more sensual, dangerous and intimate extravaganza, but the Cirkus Cirkör director, Tilde Björfors, doesn’t go that route so much as double down on delicate whimsy, add an indie-rock band (Irya’s Playground) and employ a few bits of stagecraft from experimental theater. The billowing sheet on the ground trick remains as familiar as juggling pins, which Jay Gilligan does marvelously.The central theme is the life-affirming value of taking risks, but this slick show rarely plays up the danger that is at the core of the circus’s appeal. Everything moves too slowly, and the occasional reliance on a cushion to protect performers from a bad fall prevents any anxiety.The one true heart-pounding moment is when a woman climbs a rope in a few bounds and then, from the height of the stage, drops, plummeting almost to her death at an incomprehensible speed. No matter how many times you’ve seen that performed, your jaw still drops.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','So this week, I assembled that list, with help from readers and members of the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts. The institute certifies financial planners and other professionals who specialize in helping people whose marriages have ended.You may be willing to pay any price to remove yourself from a toxic marriage with the least amount of haggling. Many more of you, however, are probably seeking an equitable split, but have no idea what to budget for or evaluate.So this list is a place to start. Please post additions to it in the comments with the related post on the Bucks blog.HEALTH INSURANCE If you are on your spouse’s health insurance plan, you won’t be able to use it once you’re no longer married. The government’s Cobra rules allow you to continue coverage for up to three years, but you have to pay the premium yourself, which may not be affordable once you’re shouldering rent or a mortgage alone.“I thought, ‘This isn’t going to be difficult,’ ” said Shira Silverman, 34, of the Bronx, who is getting divorced. “And then I looked it up and realized it was almost impossible.” Ms. Silverman works as a freelancer and doesn’t have access to insurance through work.Some people who are older or have pre-existing conditions find that they can’t get health insurance at all. Whatever your situation, it’s best to know what insurance will cost you before the divorce is final. That way, you can negotiate a settlement that covers the premium or find cheaper housing so that you don’t have to do without health insurance.MENTAL HEALTH Barbara Shapiro, a financial planner and divorce specialist with the HMS Financial Group in Dedham, Mass., refers to the dissolution of marriage as death without a body. The mourning and trauma that results for you (and your children, if you have any) may make therapy necessary.David Wanderman, who got divorced earlier this decade and has seen a therapist for many of the years since, said this was not a place to skimp. “The reality is, I kind of have no choice,” he said. “These are things that are bigger than myself, and I’m not equipped to understand them.”Mr. Wanderman, 45, a wedding and event photographer in Manhattan, went without health insurance for a while and hunted down low-cost therapists in public clinics and elsewhere. Other people with higher income, however, may need to pay $100 or more for sessions if their health insurance doesn’t cover them or has a high deductible.CREDIT It’s easy to let the bills slip when you’re huddled with lawyers and no longer speaking to your spouse. But letting things slide can do lasting damage to your credit, and it can happen in a number of ways.Liz Pulliam Weston, author of “Your Credit Score: Your Money & What’s at Stake,” suggests canceling jointly held credit cards and transferring any balance that a spouse is responsible for to a card in that spouse’s name.You should also try to get your name removed from the mortgage if you are no longer responsible for the payments. If your spouse pays late, accidentally or on purpose, it will hurt your credit. That will complicate your ability to refinance, get a new mortgage or apply for an auto loan when you’re on your own.HIRED HELP Once there are no longer two of you around, you may have to hire others for everything from yard maintenance and home repair to babysitting. This cost ought to be part of your budget — and negotiations.KEEPING HOUSE When a couple splits, one member of the household often has a strong desire to keep the family home, perhaps to provide some continuity for the children. After a few years of being house rich and cash poor, however, reality sets in and the house goes up for sale.The problem at that point, according to Donna Cheswick of BPU Investment Management in Greensburg, Pa., is that you’re solely responsible for all the costs of selling, including paying the real estate agent and sprucing up the house. So it’s best to be brutally realistic before the divorce is final about the costs of staying in your house.TAXES Once someone buys that house, there may be capital gains taxes to pay if it has appreciated more than $250,000. This may seem like a high-class problem in this market. But if you had decided to sell it before the divorce was final, you and your spouse might have had a $500,000 exemption from capital gains instead of just half that.In general, it’s crucial to consider the after-tax value of everything, from retirement accounts to deferred compensation when splitting up assets. Annette Brown, a divorce specialist in San Francisco, also noted that judges sometimes failed to consider which spouse could best benefit when awarding the right to future tax deductions and credits relating to the couple’s children.SPOUSAL EDUCATION Haven’t worked for a while? You may need retraining or a new degree entirely. Gary L. Zaugg, a financial planner and divorce specialist in Virginia Beach, noted that some divorce settlements assumed that a few years of alimony ought to be enough to pay for this. If you expect the costs to be steep, however, they probably ought to be a separate line item in the settlement or at least part of the negotiation.TEENAGERS If you have joint custody of your children, you may end up buying computers, clothes and other items for their second residence. What many couples don’t anticipate or budget for if their children are small, however, are the extra costs of the teenage years.Disagreements about what is truly necessary are practically inevitable. If you don’t want your child to do without, you may end up paying the full bill for all sorts of new costs, according to Lori Dolan Frymark of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Pasadena, Calif.She ticked off the following list for starters: prom expenses, cheerleading, sports gear, cars and car insurance, allowance and college visits and applications. The actual cost of college is a big one, too. And don’t forget cellphones.FUTURE LEGAL COSTS Even after tallying up all of the above, you still have to consider that years later, your spouse may come after you for more money or try to pay less after a job loss. Then you’re liable for another four or five figures in legal bills.While you may not want to earmark emergency funds just for that, the larger point is this: Long after you move on emotionally, divorce may haunt you financially.This is not a reason to stay in a marriage that is making you miserable. It’s just a reminder that without a lot of planning while you’re in the middle of it, divorce may never have a happy financial ending.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea threatened Friday to take “merciless military measures” along a disputed maritime border with South Korea, escalating tensions as President Obama began a weeklong visit to Asia.The two Korean navies clashed on Tuesday in their first violent skirmish in seven years, and since then the North has issued harsh daily statements demanding a South Korean apology and warning that the South will “pay dearly” for the naval clash. The two Koreas have accused each other of violating territorial waters and firing the first shot in the skirmish, which left a North Korean ship badly damaged.On Friday, a statement from the North Korean military said the South Korean vessels had attacked its patrol boat with thousands of rounds of ammunition. South Korea, which had initially said it fired 200 to 250 rounds, later said that it had fired thousands of shots. The South said one of its patrol boats was also lightly damaged when the North Korean vessel fired 50 rounds.The clash erupted in the western coastal waters controlled by South Korea under a demarcation line drawn by the United Nations at the end of hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War.North Korea reiterated its claim to a border line that is farther south than the current one, known as the Northern Limit Line. “From this moment, we will take merciless military measures to defend” the line, the North said, without elaborating.North Korea has previously used periods of heightened tensions to increase its negotiating leverage. The skirmish came as South Korean news media reported that South Korean envoys were secretly meeting North Korean officials to arrange a meeting between President Lee Myung-bak and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Lee’s office has denied these reports.'"
"'09-11-14,'0','“I welcome anything that would bring these terrorists to trial,” said Sally Regenhard, whose son, Christian, was killed in the attack, his remains never recovered. “After eight long years there has been no justice on this on any level, and we want these people brought to justice.”The lingering wash of emotions of Sept. 11, however, runs strong, and they run differently. To many others, the prospect of the trial was both unfair and too repulsive to entertain.“It’s absolutely disgusting,” said Joan Molinaro, whose son, Carl, a firefighter, also died in the attack. She said of Mr. Mohammed, “He was willing to plead guilty in a military court. Now he comes to New York and gets all the rights of an American citizen, which he isn’t. He’s going to be, what, two blocks from ground zero, where he can see his handiwork and mock those he murdered.”She used to live on Staten Island, but has moved to a small town in Pennsylvania. She couldn’t take hearing the wailing sirens of fire trucks.She started crying. “Every day I get up and know I’ll never see my son again,” she said. “This is just a smack in his face.”Margit Arias-Kastell lost her husband, Adam Arias, in Tower 2. She, too, could not countenance the prospect of the suspects being defended by lawyers in a court in her city. She was among scores of relatives who had signed a letter opposing regular criminal trials for them.""It’s totally unfair,"" she said. ""Why do we have to constantly relive this? When do we get to be at peace? They should be hung.""The divergent reactions of victims’ relatives very much echoed a similar split vote among the full universe of New Yorkers.Many of the city’s elected officials endorsed the decision. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement, “It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site, where so many New Yorkers were murdered.” He pointed out that the city had been the setting for other terrorism trials, including that of Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1995 in a plot to blow up New York landmarks.Representative Jerrold Nadler, whose district includes Lower Manhattan, said in a statement, “New York is not afraid of terrorists, we want to confront them, we want to bring them to justice and we want to hold them accountable for their despicable actions.”Yet there has been widespread public opposition to allowing any American city to accept for trial, or detention, detainees being held at the military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Various legislators have argued that their entry would be dangerous and put populations in peril.“I fear trying them in our country,” said Mike Low, whose daughter, Sara Elizabeth Low, died on one of the planes that struck the towers. He worries that “the defense will have so many tools.” He worries that “we’re giving these monsters a forum to spew their garbage once more. They’ll make a circus out of it and just play it to the hilt.”Ronald L. Kuby, a New York lawyer who has represented defendants in terrorism investigations, took the position that it was important that the attack’s victims, which he counted as most people in the city, could “walk downtown and see if justice is being done,” adding, “The citizenry of New York has a right to bear witness to this proceeding.”But to what extent do New Yorkers, especially victims’ relatives, want to see the faces of the accused plotters and listen to lawyers argue in their defense?""If you had a child who’s murdered, do you avoid going to a trial?"" asked Maureen Bosco, whose son, Richard E. Bosco, died in the towers. ""That’s where we stand. My son was killed by these people. It’s out of respect to him and to get closure for us.""“My son died,” Mr. Riches said. “I want to speak for him. I’ll go wherever I have to go. I want to see these guys convicted.”Others said they would not go. “There’s never going to be any closure for me,"" said Elaine Leuning, who lost her son, Paul Battaglia. “I don’t want to be involved in the trial. It’s not going to do it for me, it’s just not. It’s not going to make me feel any better. This is my son. This is a piece of me that’s gone.""Those who live and work in the downtown neighborhoods near ground zero had apprehensions of their own about the coming trial. They have long grudgingly endured flocks of tourists and souvenir peddlers. Now they face a mass migration that will likely descend on the court: demonstrators, curiosity seekers, media crews and the souvenir vendors.Mike McCalman, 42, who lives in a 25-story building called Chatham Towers, next to the courthouse, said that he and his neighbors were resigned to the disruption that was likely to accompany the trial. “We heard about it this morning and said, ‘Here we go,’ ” he said., adding: “They have to be tried somewhere.”Anthony Maruffi, a parking lot attendant, had no problem with the decision. “If they are going to be tried, they should be tried here,” he said. “This is where they committed their crimes.”Yet George Zouvelos, who owns Spartan Bail Bonds, which has an office near the courthouse, worried about security. His solution? “Send them to Washington.” Domingo Nunez, who works at Spartan, said, “This community is going to raise hell,” predicting that “it’s going to be very rough on some people. I’m getting goose bumps just thinking about it.”'"
"'09-11-14,'0','As a result, Mr. Obama can expect to get an earful from Chinese officials not only on the Dalai Lama, whom the president says he will meet after the China trip, but also on Taiwan, the self-governing island that China says is a rebel province. Taiwan receives annual arms shipments from the United States.“Tibet and Taiwan are, from China’s perspective, the two core sovereignty issues, and they rank above all others in Chinese diplomacy,” said David Shambaugh, a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Disputed territory is also the biggest obstacle in relations between China and its largest neighbor, India. On Tuesday, Mr. Qin denounced the Dalai Lama for his visit this week to the Tibetan Buddhist enclave of Tawang in the Indian Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh.Tawang is one of the most potent symbols of China’s unresolved sovereignty issues. China says it was once part of Tibet, which the Chinese military seized in 1951, and so belongs to Beijing. India says that Tibetan leaders ceded it to British-ruled India in a 1914 treaty. Tawang figured centrally in a border war between China and India in 1962.Part of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the notion, rightly or wrongly held, that it ousted foreign influence from the country and has tried to reunite fragments of China to return the boundaries of the modern nation to roughly those of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) at its height. That includes Taiwan, Tibet, the western region of Xinjiang and, by China’s calculation, Tawang.“In most respects, the People’s Republic of China, of course, inherits the fixed boundaries of its predecessor nation-state, the Republic of China, which declared as its territorial boundaries what had been mostly the messy frontiers of the Qing empire,” Alice Miller, a historian and research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in a China discussion forum posting that she agreed to make public.“Messy” is the operative word here. In the age of empires, there were no hard and fast borders, whether the imperial rulers were the Ottoman Turks or the Manchus or the Moghuls. The seat of empire had its sphere of influence, radiating outward, with tributary states occupying the borderlands but rarely being governed in the same way as regions within a modern nation today.Trying to define national borders along the contours of an old empire is a daunting task. If, for example, Tibet paid tribute to the Qing emperor at certain points in history, should Tibet be part of modern China? If Tawang did the same with Tibetan rulers in Lhasa, should Tawang be part of modern Tibet?Along with India and Indonesia, China is one of a handful of vast, multiethnic nations that follow the contours of fallen empires. Because of their size and history, all three nations grapple with the same issues: border disputes, ethno-nationalism, occasionally violent movements by disaffected ethnic or religious minorities.China is often criticized as handling uprisings harshly in Tibet and Xinjiang, which the country’s ethnic Han leaders consider internal issues of sovereignty. But in dealing with its neighbors on territorial issues, China has in the recent past generally sought to settle conflicts through negotiation, scholars say.Since 1949, it has resolved 17 of 23 border disputes, offering concessions in 15 of those instances and, over all, receiving less than half of the contested territory, said M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M.I.T. The compromises have generally come at times of regime instability, when the Communist Party has felt threatened by external or internal forces, he added.The big question, then, is whether Chinese leaders will continue to show flexibility on border issues as China becomes a greater world power, and as it stamps out internal threats.China’s maritime disputes have proven harder to settle than those on land. In the resource-rich seas to its east and south, China is trying to assert control of various islands — most notably the Spratly, Paracel and Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands — that are also claimed in whole or in part by other Asian countries. In March, official Chinese news organizations reported that the government intended to send six more patrol vessels to the South China Sea in the next three to five years.Even the United States has run directly afoul of China’s maritime border claims: On March 8, five Chinese vessels harassed an American surveillance ship in what Pentagon officials said are international waters. The Chinese insisted that the American ship, the Impeccable, was conducting illegal surveillance in waters under their jurisdiction.Dennis C. Blair, the national intelligence director, told Congress that China’s general behavior in the South China Sea was “more military, aggressive, forward-pushing than we saw a couple of years before.”This all speaks to how a bolder, brasher China might handle issues of sovereignty and territory, comparisons to Abraham Lincoln notwithstanding.“The biggest unknown is how a stronger China will behave in its outstanding disputes,” Mr. Fravel said. “When it has compromised in the past, mostly in disputes on its land border, it was a relatively weak state. The question now becomes: how will a stronger China behave in its remaining territorial disputes over maritime sovereignty and with India?”'"

We’re going to finish. That’s what we need to do.”The dominant fashion of the Horned Frogs’ win is sure to reverberate throughout college football and ensure a B.C.S. berth if T.C.U. finishes the regular season undefeated. And even though Texas is ranked No. 2, the Horned Frogs’ victory put them in the conversation when discussing the best team in this state.By halftime, T.C.U. had scored more points than Utah (8-2, 5-1) had allowed in any game this season.T.C.U.’s defense, which entered the game third in the F.B.S., held the Utes to 284 yards. The Horned Frogs had 549, including 342 on the ground, and Horned Frogs quarterback Andy Dalton had another efficient performance, completing 17 of 29 passes for 207 yards with a touchdown and an interception.And as much of a mismatch as the game was, the score was tied at 7-7 after a 10-yard touchdown run by Utah receiver Shaky Smithson with 4 minutes 48 seconds left in the first quarter.The tie did not last long. On T.C.U.’s next possession, Dalton threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to tailback Ryan Christian. After blocking a punt, the Horned Frogs scored again on wide receiver Jeremy Kerley’s 3-yard touchdown run.A 39-yard punt return by Kerley then set up a 1-yard touchdown run by wide receiver Antonie Hicks, making the score 28-7. On Utah’s ensuing possession, T.C.U. linebacker Tank Carder intercepted a pass and returned it 15 yards for a touchdown to push his team’s lead to 28 points with 11:40 left in the second quarter.The last three touchdowns came in a span of 2:31.“We got some breaks,” Patterson said. “Some things happened to us.”Yet as dominant as T.C.U.’s victory was, it will not help much in the B.C.S. standings, said Jerry Palm, an independent analyst and the publisher of collegebcs.com. Palm said he did not expect the Horned Frogs to move up from their No. 4 spot when the new B.C.S. standings are released Sunday.Palm said he anticipated that T.C.U. would remain behind Florida, Alabama and Texas. The Horned Frogs could eventually be passed by No. 5 Cincinnati, but they should stay ahead of No. 6 Boise State (10-0, 5-0 Western Athletic Conference) and be B.C.S. bound with wins in their last two games.“If anybody had any doubts about this team, this helps erase them,” Palm said. “People were going to have doubts no matter what because of the league they play in. You’re never going to win those people over, but anybody that was sitting on the fence about this team, they would at least have to be impressed.”T.C.U. is in control of the conference race, but for it to have any chance of playing in the B.C.S. title game, it will need help from Florida, Alabama and Texas. At a minimum, two of those three teams would have to lose, and maybe Cincinnati as well, Palm said, to give the Horned Frogs a berth in the national championship game.“And even then, the voters would have to warm up to the idea,” he said.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','The federal case is unusually complex, involving 90 wineries, 40 private collectors, the local police, the United States attorney’s office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and the Internal Revenue Service.“It’s very complicated,” said Sgt. William Fraass of the Sausalito Police Department, who worked with federal investigators and also put together a separate case that resulted in embezzlement charges against Mr. Anderson in Marin County Superior Court.Mark Reichel, Mr. Anderson’s court-appointed lawyer for the federal trial, denies that his client set the fire. He intends to argue that Mr. Anderson had no motive for arson, but that federal authorities settled on him because of the pending embezzlement charges in Marin.On the surface, Mr. Anderson seems an unlikely villain. Raised in Berkeley and Orinda and a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Anderson moved to Sausalito more than 20 years ago and immersed himself in its civic life. He joined the city’s Parks and Recreation Committee and volunteered for the sister city program with Japan.“He was an upstanding and active citizen whose heart was in Sausalito,” said Stephen Fraser, a Sausalito lawyer whose wife, Judy, is Mr. Anderson’s first cousin.Mr. Anderson came across as a bon vivant, according to friends and colleagues. His 300-pound frame exuded confidence, while his appearance — he had a long gray ponytail and wore baggy black sweat clothes — made him stand out.“I thought he was a great big jolly guy,” said Tom Stern, who worked with him when Mr. Anderson was writing a column for the local newspaper.In 1998, Mr. Anderson opened Sausalito Cellars, a wine-storage business on the Sausalito waterfront. An early customer was Samuel Maslak, a Woodside businessman whose South San Francisco restaurant, Bacchanal, had filed for bankruptcy protection. In May 2001, Mr. Maslak sent 756 cases of the restaurant’s wine to Sausalito Cellars until the courts could determine ownership, said Sergeant Fraass.Ron Lussier, an avid collector of a rare cult wine called Sine Qua Non, worth $200 to $300 a bottle, was another of Mr. Anderson’s customers. He had been impressed with the company’s Web site, which promised constant monitoring, an online inventory and delivery services.The first indication of problems came in December 2003, when a representative of Christie’s auction house went to retrieve Mr. Maslak’s wine. More than 5,700 bottles, worth $648,724, were missing. Mr. Anderson insisted that the wine had never been delivered, Sergeant Fraass said. The police filed embezzlement charges against Mr. Anderson in February 2004.The charges were not widely publicized, so most of Mr. Anderson’s clients did not know and stayed with him. But then they, too, found wines missing, like a 1969 bottle of Lafitte Rothschild worth $29,000.When Mr. Lussier heard about the embezzlement charges, he asked to retrieve his collection. Mr. Anderson offered varying excuses why the wine was not available, Mr. Lussier said. When some crates were returned, Mr. Lussier said, he discovered that they had been pried open and his bottles replaced with Trader Joe’s “Two-Buck Chuck.”Documents filed with the federal court by prosecutors show that from 2001 to 2004, two auction houses, Premier Cru and Golden West International, paid Mr. Anderson $778,000 for various wines. In 2004, using an assumed name, Mr. Anderson started sending his clients’ wine for auction to the Chicago Wine Company, which paid him $242,000, according to court documents.In the end, Sergeant Fraass said, 11 clients reported that 8,082 bottles of wine, worth at least $1.2 million, were missing.Douglas Rappaport, who represented Mr. Anderson in his preliminary hearing in Marin County, said the case was based on misunderstanding, not criminal intent. “It was difficult to tell if it is theft or sloppy record-keeping,” he said. “All the facts say it is sloppy record-keeping.”Mr. Anderson has pleaded not guilty to the charges; the Marin case has been postponed until after the federal trial.In 2003, after he was evicted from his Sausalito space, Mr. Anderson moved his clients’ wine to Wines Central, a massive bunker on the decommissioned Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo. The warehouse, once used to repair submarines, had concrete floors and walls three feet thick. Sean Thackrey, a Bolinas winemaker who stored wines there, said, “It looked like it would withstand a direct nuclear hit.”Most of the wines there — the wines that eventually burned — belonged to clients of Wines Central; Mr. Anderson sublet a 2,500-square-foot space enclosed by a fence on the mezzanine level. In August 2005, he was evicted. Debbie Polverino, the manager of Wines Central, said that he was behind on his rent and that irate customers were constantly looking for him.Court documents cite conversations showing that he was angry about the eviction. Prosecutors say he arrived at Wines Central around 11:30 a.m. on Oct. 12, 2005. The fire, which burned as hot as 2,000 degrees, broke out at 3:18 p.m. High-end, established Napa wines boiled in their bottles, and some newcomers lost everything. Coho Winery had only been in operation for three years and was just preparing to sell its first wines, worth approximately $500,000, according to Gary Lipp, the co-owner.Arson investigators discovered a propane torch and rags soaked in gasoline in Bay 14, the section rented by Mr. Anderson, according to court documents. They also show that he had visited Web sites with instructions on making bombs and cellphone triggers.Mr. Anderson has been held without bail in Sacramento County Jail for more than two years. In an interview, his lawyer said Mr. Anderson had moved his clients’ wine from Wines Central to another warehouse, so he did not have any incentive to set a fire to destroy evidence. Mr. Reichel added, “He didn’t burn it, but he’s the easy person to blame.”Without wine to sell, many wineries lost momentum that will take years to recover, said Ted Hall, communications director of Napa Valley Vintners, a trade association of 370 wineries.“In this wildly competitive world,” he said, “once you are unable to fulfill your order, then you have a lot of rebuilding to do.”'"
"'09-11-15,'0','The reason they didn’t is obvious enough. Their screeds about the Hasan case are completely at odds with both the Afghanistan policy they endorse and the leadership that must execute that policy, including Gen. Stanley McChrystal. These hawks, all demanding that Obama act on McChrystal’s proposals immediately, do not seem to have read his strategy assessment for Afghanistan or the many press interviews he gave as it leaked out. If they had, they’d discover that the whole thrust of his counterinsurgency pitch is to befriend and win the support of the Afghan population — i.e., Muslims. The “key to success,” the general wrote in his brief to the president, will be “strong personal relationships forged between security forces and local populations.”McChrystal thinks we might even jolly up those Muslims who historically and openly hate America. “I don’t think much of the are ideologically driven,” he told Dexter Filkins of The Times. “In my view their past is not important. Some people say, ‘Well, they have blood on their hands.’ I’d say, ‘So do a lot of people.’ I think we focus on future behavior.”Whether we could win those hearts and minds is, arguably, an open question — though it’s an objective that would require a partner other than Hamid Karzai and many more troops than even McChrystal is asking for (or America presently has). But to say that McChrystal’s optimistic — dare one say politically correct? — view of Muslim pliability doesn’t square with that of America’s hawks is the understatement of the decade.As their Fort Hood rhetoric made clear, McChrystal’s most vehement partisans don’t trust American Muslims, let alone those of the Taliban, no matter how earnestly the general may argue that they can be won over by our troops’ friendliness (or bribes). If, as the right has it, our Army cannot be trusted to recognize a Hasan in its own ranks, then how will it figure out who the “good” Muslims will be as we try to build a “stable” state (whatever “stable” means) in a country that has never had a functioning central government? If our troops can’t be protected from seemingly friendly Muslim American brethren in Killeen, Tex., what are the odds of survival for the 40,000 more troops the hawks want to deploy to Kabul and sinkholes beyond?About the only prominent voice among the liberal-bashing, Obama-loathing right who has noted this gaping contradiction is Mark Steyn of National Review. “Members of the best trained, best equipped fighting force on the planet” were “gunned down by a guy who said a few goofy things no one took seriously,” he wrote. “And that’s the problem: America has the best troops and fiercest firepower, but no strategy for throttling the ideology that drives the enemy — in Afghanistan and in .” You have to applaud Steyn’s rare intellectual consistency within his camp. One imagines that he does not buy the notion that our Army, however brilliant, has a shot at building “strong personal relationships” with a population that often regards us as occupiers and infidels.In a week of horrific news, it was good to hear at the end of it that Obama is dissatisfied with the four Afghanistan options he has been weighing so far. The more time he deliberates, the more he is learning that he’s on a fool’s errand with no exit. After Karzai was spared a runoff last month and declared the winner of the fraud-infested August “election,” Obama demanded that he address his government’s corruption as a price for American support. Only days later the Afghan president mocked the American president by parading his most tainted cronies on camera and granting an interview to ’s “NewsHour” devoted to spewing his contempt for his American benefactors.Matthew Hoh, a former Marine and, until recently, a State Department official in Afghanistan, could be found on MSNBC on Thursday once again asking the question no war advocate can answer, “Do you want Americans fighting and dying for the Karzai regime?” Hoh quit his post on principle in September despite the urging of colleagues, including our ambassador there, , that he stay and fight over war policy from the inside. But Hoh had lost confidence in our strategy and would not retract his resignation. Now he has been implicitly seconded by Eikenberry himself. Last week we learned that the ambassador, a retired general who had been the top American military commander in Afghanistan as recently as 2007, had sent two cables to Obama urging caution about sending more troops.We don’t know everything in those cables. What we do know is that American intelligence continues to say that fewer than 100 Qaeda operatives can still be found in Afghanistan. We also know that the Taliban, which are currently estimated to number in the tens of thousands, can’t be eliminated. As McChrystal put it to Filkins, there is no “finite number” of Taliban, so there’s no way to vanquish them. Hence his counterinsurgency alternative, which could take decades, costing untold billions and countless lives.Perhaps those on the right are correct about Hasan, and he is just one cog in an apocalyptic jihadist plot that has infiltrated our armed forces. If so, then they have an obligation to explain how pouring more troops into Afghanistan would have stopped Hasan from plotting in Killeen. Don’t hold your breath. If we have learned anything concrete so far from the massacre at Fort Hood, it’s that our hawks, for all their certitude, are as utterly confused as the rest of us about who it is we’re fighting in Afghanistan and to what end.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','There is another reason to be skeptical about tests to determine which smokers are at risk for lung cancer, in addition to the concerns articulated in your article. That reason is the impact of secondhand cigarette smoke exposure, which increases the risk of many cancers, including breast cancer.Genetic testing may tell people something about their own risk from their own behaviors. What these tests can’t tell people is about the risks to our family members and neighbors from our behaviors.Genetic tests will be truly socially useful only if they help us determine how to protect everyone from the environmental risks of cancer. They will be socially harmful if they result in marginalizing those most at risk from those exposures.Lung cancer is only one of the serious bad outcomes associated with cigarette smoking, and not even the most common. Emphysema and other forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and esophageal cancer contribute to the total of roughly 440,000 Americans who die each year from tobacco-related illness.A person with a low risk score on the gene test might feel a false sense of security and continue smoking, only to succumb to another serious tobacco-related illness. The best medical advice for smokers? Stop.'"

"'09-11-15,'0','Beyond that, there is already a buzz growing that Nicholson has a bona-fide shot at an N.B.A. career.And that is not just the perception of Coach Mark Schmidt, who informed Nicholson and his parents of that possibility at the end of last season.“I think Andrew is a marvelous young player,” said Martelli, who in 15 years at St. Joseph’s has had numerous players make it to the N.B.A. “When I put on my radar screen guys in our league that are going to play in that very special league with only the best players in the whole world, I think Andrew is on track to do that.”Shy and polite, Nicholson barely reacts when told of Martelli’s praise.“Oh, thanks, that’s motivation,” said Nicholson, who acknowledged he probably did not yet grasp his potential. “If someone sees it, I guess it can really happen.”Nicholson has been a revelation. He was barely recruited out of suburban Toronto because he did not begin playing organized basketball until his junior season in high school, and only after a coach coaxed him to join the team. Nicholson then blew a chance to gain attention among top colleges in the United States after he broke his ankle and missed several high-profile summer tournaments before his senior year.The Bonnies are not complaining. In November 2007, Nicholson became the first high school recruit for Schmidt, who took over a ragtag team that did not have enough scholarship players to hold a proper scrimmage.Schmidt happily remembers meeting Nicholson, and how he had to throw away the recruiting manual. Never before did the coach recall having to hard-sell a prospect on the chemistry department which, by chance, is housed in a newly built science building.“What future N.B.A. player would ever say that he’s going to Bonaventure because they have a new science building?” Schmidt said. “I mean, it’s great, it’s refreshing. But very few kids that are going to have a chance to pay at the next level would have that mentality.”Nicholson’s heavy course load has led Schmidt to make certain adjustments by scheduling practices around his star player. But Nicholson does not receive preferential treatment.“I told Andrew when we recruited him that, I want you to be a chemistry major,” Schmidt said. “If that’s what you want, go for it. But understand that you have a responsibility as a basketball player as well, so you’re going to have to balance those things.”Nicholson was one of two players in the country last season to rank in the top 15 in field-goal percentage and blocks. He averaged 12.5 points and 6 rebounds in 30 games, including 25 starts, while earning six conference rookie of the week honors.Nicholson helped the Bonnies to a 15-15 finish and their first berth in the Atlantic 10 tournament in four years.“How badly does he want to be the best?” Schmidt said. “He’s not nearly as good as he needs to be. He understands that. And that’s one of the great things about coaching Andrew: he’s never satisfied.”Nicholson said he was drawn to chemistry because he was fascinated with how things are put together. He took up basketball because it was a game that came naturally but did not come easily for him.“No, you’ve still got to work for it,” he said, noting the most recent reminder came last month, when he learned the Bonnies were picked to finish 11th among the 14 teams in the conference preseason poll.“We shouldn’t be 11th,” Nicholson said. “We’ll definitely show them.”'"
"'09-11-15,'0','He cites the Small Business Investment Company program, which began offering federal loans and tax incentives 50 years ago. Critics quickly contended that it conducted minimal review of its recipients, Mr. Lerner says. Despite some success, the program is marred by a bureaucracy that scares off the best venture capitalists, he says.Mr. Lerner writes that earlier in this decade, a grant offered through the Small Business Innovation Research Program, a government effort to help small high-tech companies, was pulled from Intronn, a company researching a promising cure for cystic fibrosis. The reason, he writes, was that Intronn had sold a stake to a venture capital firm that had more than 500 employees; that, in turn, forced Intronn to abandon its cystic fibrosis research.Mr. Lerner says problems with public-sector help have been common worldwide. He relates stories of Norway, decades ago, squandering a substantial portion of its oil wealth on “ill-conceived new businesses begun by relatives of parliamentarians and bureaucrats,” and of the Malaysian government opening a huge complex called BioValley in 2005 without first confirming demand for the facility, which became mocked as the “Valley of Bio-Ghosts.”But he says partnerships of the public and private sectors are still crucial, for at least two reasons. The first, he says, is the link between innovation and economic growth. The second is the link between innovation and government-supported new businesses, which typically take on much riskier and potentially more rewarding projects than older, bureaucratically hidebound giants.In reply to skeptics who say public-sector interventions can never be effective, he offers a section titled “The (Uncensored) Story of Silicon Valley.” In it, he documents that government was a catalyst in the growth of the high-tech sector and numerous prominent companies.In World War I and World War II, he notes, military contracts spurred the growth of companies like Magnavox and Hewlett-Packard. More recently, he says, the S.B.I.C. provided support Apple, Compaq and Intel before they went public.Mr. Lerner provides more than a dozen rules of thumb for effective government intervention in the private sector. Attesting to his own belief in capitalism, he urges governments to “let the market decide the direction” of their stimulus programs and the selection of the appropriate companies and venture capital funds to carry them out.“Rather than fund dozens of groups immediately, programs should first fund a handful of entities,” he advises. “As feedback comes in from the early participants, second and third batches of capital may be invested, or the capital of the pioneering firms and funds may be supplemented.”LIKEWISE, he cautions against the me-too approach that national and regional governments often take in supporting entrepreneurial projects. He says, for example, that 49 of the 50 states recently started major programs to promote the biotechnology industry in hopes of creating regional activity clusters.“Realistically,” he says, “only a handful of these states had the basic scientific resources and the supporting infrastructure (e.g., lawyers versed in biotechnology patent law and financing practice) to support a successful cluster, so the bulk of these funds were wasted.”The herd mentality, Mr. Lerner adds, is often further fueled by political expediency. “All too often technology transfer offices are encouraged to maximize the short-run returns from licensing transactions,” he says. “This leads to an emphasis on transactions with established corporations that can make substantial upfront payments, even though licensing new technologies to start-ups can yield substantial returns in the long run.”The book is refreshingly easy for a layman to read, and much of the advice is common-sensical, which is as much a weakness as a strength. He emphasizes the importance of combating so-called agency problems, an academic euphemism for the graft and corruption in government programs that he finds to exist around the globe. His remedies involve things like “creating firewalls between elected officials and program administrators” and “careful assessment of the program.”But, alas, history shows that politicians and bureaucrats don’t always use common sense.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','In “Going Rogue” Ms. Palin talks perfunctorily about fiscal responsibility and a muscular foreign policy, and more passionately about the importance of energy independence, but she is quite up front about the fact that much of her appeal lies in her just-folks “hockey mom” ordinariness. She pretends no particular familiarity with the Middle East, the Iraq war or Islamic politics — “I knew the history of the conflict,” she writes, “to the extent that most Americans did.” And she argues that “there’s no better training ground for politics than motherhood.”A CNN poll taken last month indicates that 7 out of 10 Americans now think Ms. Palin is not qualified to be president, and even as ardent a conservative as Charles Krauthammer lamented in September 2008 “the paucity of any Palin record or expressed conviction on the major issues of our time.”Yet Mr. McCain’s astonishing decision to pick someone with so little experience (less than two years as the governor of Alaska, and before that, two terms as mayor of Wasilla, an Alaskan town with fewer than 7,000 residents) as his running mate underscores just how alarmingly expertise is discounted — or equated with elitism — in our increasingly democratized era, and just how thoroughly colorful personal narratives overshadow policy arguments and actual knowledge. Ms. Palin herself had a surprisingly nonchalant reaction to Mr. McCain’s initial phone call about the vice president’s slot, writing that she was not astonished, that it felt “like a natural progression.”Ms. Palin suggests that she and her husband, Todd, are ideally qualified to represent the Joe Six-Packs of the world because they are Joe Six-Packs themselves. “We know what it’s like to be on a tight budget and wonder how we’re going to pay for our own health care, let alone college tuition,” she writes in “Going Rogue.” “We know what it’s like to work union jobs, to be blue-collar, white-collar, to have our kids in public schools. We felt our very normalcy, our status as ordinary Americans, could be a much-needed fresh breeze blowing into Washington, D.C.”“Going Rogue” (written with an assist from Lynn Vincent, a senior writer and former features editor of World, an evangelical magazine) is part cagey spin, part earnest autobiography, part payback hit job. And its most compelling sections deal not with politics but with Ms. Palin’s life in Alaska and her family. Despite an annoying tendency to drop the names of lots of writers and philosophers gratuitously — in the course of this book she quotes or alludes to Pascal, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Paine, Pearl S. Buck, Mark Twain and Melville — she does a lively job of conveying the frontier feel of the 49th state, where television broadcasts were tape-delayed in her youth and they shopped for clothes “via mail order through the Sears catalog,” where “we don’t have big-league professional sports teams or many celebrities (except famous dog mushers),” and so regard politics as a local sport.The self-portrait created in these pages recalls the early profiles of Ms. Palin that appeared just after her debut on the national stage: a self-reliant frontierswoman who knows how to field dress a moose; a feisty gal with lots of moxie and pep; a former beauty queen with a George W. Bush-like aptitude for mangling the English language. (The first paragraph of the book contains the phrase “I breathed in an autumn bouquet that combined everything small-town America with rugged splashes of the Last Frontier.”) She talks about juggling motherhood with politics, and gives a moving account of learning that her son Trig would be born with Down syndrome.She recalls her initial feeling — “I don’t think I could handle that” — and her “sudden understanding of why people would grasp at a quick ‘solution,’ a way to make the ‘problem’ just go away,” though her own pro-life stance would deny women the choice of having an abortion.Elsewhere in this volume she talks about creationism, saying she “didn’t believe in the theory that human beings — thinking, loving beings — originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea” or from “monkeys who eventually swung down from the trees.” In everything that happens to her, from meeting Todd to her selection by Mr. McCain for the Republican ticket, she sees the hand of God: “My life is in His hands. I encourage readers to do what I did many years ago, invite Him in to take over.”Just as Ms. Palin’s planned book tour resembles a campaign rollout — complete with a bus tour and pit stops in battleground states — so the second half of this book often reads like a calculated attempt to position Ms. Palin for 2012. She tries to compare herself to Ronald Reagan by repeatedly invoking his name and record. She talks about being “a Commonsense Conservative” and worrying about the national deficit. And she attempts to explain, rationalize or refute controversial incidents and allegations that emerged during the 2008 race.She says she “never sought to ban any books” as mayor of Wasilla, and has always had a “special passion for reading.” She suggests that the $150,000-plus designer clothes were the campaign’s idea, that she and her family are actually frugal coupon clippers who shop at Costco. And she says that she was manipulated into doing that famous series of Katie Couric interviews (which would do much to cement an image of her as an easily caricatured ignoramus) by Nicolle Wallace, a communications aide for the campaign, and that Ms. Couric just seemed to want “to frame a ‘gotcha’ moment.”Along the way Ms. Palin acknowledges that she is a busy, “got to go-go-go” sort of person — and for an average hockey mom, pretty ambitious.“As every Iditarod musher knows,” she writes of the well-known Alaska dog-sled race, “if you’re not the lead dog, the view never changes.”'"

"'09-11-15,'0','The inventors say the advertising would enable computers and other consumer electronics products to be offered to customers free or at a reduced price. In exchange, recipients would agree to view the ads. If, down the road, users found the advertisements and the attentiveness tests unendurable, they could pay to make the device “ad free” on a temporary or permanent basis.Would anyone have guessed that Apple, so widely revered, would seek patent protection of a gimmick not unlike one used to sell vacation timeshares? (Agree to attend the sales seminar and get a free weekend getaway!) Or could anyone have predicted that the Apple of 2009, a company with premium products, would file a patent application that could make it a latter-day descendant of Free PC and ZapMe, companies that in 1999 gave away PCs engineered to always display on-screen ads?What the application calls the “enforcement routine” entails administering periodic tests, like displaying on top of an ad a pop-up box with a response button that must be pressed within five seconds before disappearing to confirm that the user is paying attention.These tests “can be made progressively more aggressive if the user has failed a previous test,” the application says. One option makes the response box smaller and smaller, requiring more concentration to find and banish. Or the system can require that the user press varying keyboard combinations, the current date, or the name of the advertiser upon command, again demonstrating “the presence of an attentive user.”Everything about this technology seems so antithetical to the guiding principles of Apple that one would naturally wonder whether Steven P. Jobs even knows whether his company filed a patent application for such a thing. Apple has 34,300 employees, and Mr. Jobs, though named by Fortune magazine this month as “C.E.O. of the decade,” can’t be expected to keep track of everything that every Apple employee does.Yet Mr. Jobs is directly connected to this particular patent application: his name is the first listed of the five inventors. This is a rarity, occurring only four times among the 30 applications on which he is co-inventor that have been published by the patent office since March 2008.How Mr. Jobs reconciles this advertising technology with Apple’s culture is not known. An Apple spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the patent application.Microsoft is also working on placing advertisements where they have not been before.In its case, the plans are definite: next year, Microsoft will offer Office Starter 2010, a free version of Office pre-installed on some PCs. It will include a small Microsoft display ad in the lower-right corner of the screen, and offer only barebones versions of Word and Excel, with fewer functions than the regular paid ones.It will not be the first time that Microsoft has experimented with ads on the software that runs on PCs — it began quietly in June 2007 with a version of Microsoft Works.IN Office Starter 2010, Microsoft is not seeking revenue from advertising and is going to use the ads only to promote the full-featured, commercial versions of Office. The company plans to take customers “along a journey to educate them about the product,” said Bryson Gordon, a director on Microsoft’s Office team.By allowing customers to ignore the ads that will sit passively in the corner of the screen, Microsoft will use a gentle approach to the up-sell.The approach presented in Apple’s patent application is not gentle at all. Beyond that, it’s myopic. Were it to use the new technology, it’s hard to imagine how free, ad-supported versions of its products wouldn’t have a negative impact on the company’s brand.The technology may be clever and original enough to earn Apple a patent. But the resulting products are likely to be more irritating than beloved.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','These situations crop up regularly in spheres as diverse as politics, romance and business. The 1987 movie “Ishtar,” for example, starring Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, is still being studied for the decision-making process that created a cinematic flop that was five months late and about 80 percent over budget.But it is rare that the theory of escalation of commitment can be defined as neatly as in Professor Shubik’s auction game, which is why a self-described “entertainment shopping” site, Swoopo.com, is so fascinating. Here, the theory is employed in some diabolically inventive ways.Swoopo sells new merchandise using unusual auction formats. Let’s concentrate on one of them, the so-called penny auction.Typically an item — say, a laptop that retails for $1,500, is offered for sale. The bidding starts at a penny, and goes up in one-cent increments, but it costs bidders 60 cents to make a bid. Each auction has a scheduled closing time, but as the deadline nears, that time is extended by 20 seconds whenever someone bids.The site’s home page displays several attractive objects for sale with closing times fast approaching. It is mesmerizing.One winning strategy might seem to be this: Bid at the last second, just before an auction is about to end. To “help” you do so, the site offers an automatic bidding program called a Bid Butler that allows you to make bids in the last 10 seconds. Alas, others can also use this automatic program, and you soon discover that just as the clock is ticking down and you’re about to make your big score, a bunch of other Bid Butlers get busy, the price jumps by a few cents, and the clock adds more time. Items can remain “in their final seconds” for days.What makes this procedure so devilish is that while bidders are looking at what seem to be amazing bargains, the Web site is raking in the money. Because Swoopo collects 60 cents for each penny bid, its revenue is the selling price multiplied by 60. This means that if a computer you covet sells for $100, seemingly a bargain, Swoopo collects $6,000 in revenue, a very juicy profit.Swoopo has even sold cash using this format — specifically, checks for $1,000. My colleague Emir Kamenica and I looked at 26 such auctions we found in a data set posted on the Swoopo Web site. For each of these, the average revenue to Swoopo was $2,452. Winning bidders also did well: Of the winners, all but two made money even after accounting for the cost of their bids, with an average profit of $658. Still, the important point to remember is that, collectively, bidders are losing money. Only the lucky last bidder is a winner.It’s no surprise that Swoopo has attracted controversy. Bloggers have called it “evil,” but the company says that its winners save substantially since the winning bids are always well below the retail price of the product and that everyone else gets an exciting experience, which is worth the price of admission.Frank Han, the North America general manager of Entertainment Shopping, Swoopo’s parent company in Germany, said, “The thrill of winning one of the auctions that ends at a very low price is what keeps customers coming back.”AND some lucky bidders do get bargains. The site’s list of completed auctions includes a laptop that sold for $23.27, a video game for $5.88 and a microwave oven for $60.96, prices that don’t include bidding fees.How much danger does Swoopo pose to consumers? Your view of that may depend partly on whether you think people are playing for fun or merchandise. If they are looking for the thrill of chance, it’s hard to argue that Swoopo.com doesn’t have as much right to life as slot machines or state lotteries.But if people are looking for a good deal, the right comparison isn’t to gambling, but to a discount retailer. The difference between Swoopo and Best Buy is that at Swoopo you end up paying for stuff in the other guy’s shopping cart.What is Swoopo.com’s future? Of course, it’s possible that competition will eventually drive down its profit margin. Someone may offer to sell bids for only 30 cents, inducing Swoopo to drop its price to a quarter, and so forth. But so far that hasn’t happened.Swoopo has added a feature allowing you to apply bidding fees from an auction toward buying the product outright, at a retail price listed on the site. If you don’t want to buy that item at that price, you’ve lost your bidding fees.Market competition, meanwhile, seems to be proliferating the auction strategy rather than undermining it. A start-up called Ibidcondo.com charges $100 for a seat at an auction in which a condo is sold. For a condo worth $280,000, it sells as many as 2,800 seats. Do the math. Caveat emptor.An update: In my previous column, I tried to nudge Steve Jobs to have an app written for the Apple iPhone that would allow users to sign up easily to become organ donors.Mr. Jobs can relax. Raymond Cheung from Serenity Integration read the column and made it happen. IPhone users can download the free Donate Lives app and sign up directly on their phones.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','“I know the guys get paid for it and all that stuff, but this is really about 100 percent injury. If you’re a kicker, you’re going to get hurt. That’s just the way this thing is.”For the past two years, N.F.L. officials, medical experts and retired players have testified before Congress about the long-term effects on players who consistently absorb shots. Increased news media attention, especially reporting by Alan Schwarz of The New York Times on the issue of concussions and brain injuries and their ties to dementia among former N.F.L. players, has placed the issue on the Congressional radar screen.How do active players reconcile playing in the moment with the threat of long-term health problems?“We know the repercussions can be stuff that’s not good for you down the line,” Jets safety Kerry Rhodes said. “At the time, you think you’re invincible as young players and don’t really think that far. We’re more aware now, and I think the league is making us more aware as we get older.”On a practical level, the attention has created a dilemma for players and coaches: how to administer hard hits without violating new rules. Rhodes, 27, and his fellow defensive backs devised a term that reflects a more discerning approach to their job.“We sometimes call it making a business decision,” he said.The business decision refers to choosing when to play with reckless abandon, and when to back off.“If you have a shot you can take on a receiver and you want to send a message early on, you go and take that shot,” Rhodes said. “Sometimes you may have a guy in the hole, and it’s a whole bunch of you coming at the same time and you’re like, ‘Do I want to go in here and do this and take this chance or not?’ We call that a business decision, and that’s one way defensive backs stay away from that extra collision.”The good news is that today’s N.F.L. players are more aware of the dangers of concussions and brain damage than their predecessors were. The sobering news is that the athletes have gotten bigger, faster and stronger, and they embrace the essence of the game: inflicting and absorbing punishment.Last Sunday, Giants tight end Kevin Boss was leveled when he went over the middle for a pass. He had to leave the game against San Diego, but he eventually returned. A week earlier against Arizona, Boss was running up the seam and reaching for a pass when he was flattened. Antrel Rolle, leading with his helmet, delivered a shot that sent Boss to the sideline.“The last couple hits, as hard as they were, I did not really have, like, a blackout concussion,” Boss, 25, said. “I’ve been pretty lucky.”Boss will not know how lucky — or unlucky — he has been until 15 or 20 years from now, when the effects of day-to-day, week-to-week pounding begin to manifest themselves.“I’m sure they do accumulate,” Boss said. “I guess we’ll find out.”The N.F.L., while refusing to concede a connection between head trauma and dementia, has taken steps to make the game safer. The league continues to introduce better equipment, especially helmets, and stricter rules against helmet-to-helmet hits. This season the league outlawed the wedge on kickoffs, and the bunching of players on onside kicks.This is all well and good, but fans want to see the big hits. Highlight-reel violence drives the sport.“That’s what people pay the big bucks to see,” said Dr. Robert C. Cantu, co-director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University. “You’re not going to have the viewership if you don’t have those collisions.”Cantu is also vice president of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment. Reflecting popular thought on the subject, Cantu said the only way to reduce the incidence of concussions was to remove the head as the initial point of contact. Although the helmets worn by contemporary players prevent skull fractures and most serious bleeding in the brain, they are “not made to standards even close to prevent concussions,” Cantu said.Giants defensive end Justin Tuck’s perspective on the issue of violence and player safety goes beyond rules and equipment.“Guys have to change their mentality,” Tuck, 26, said. “We’ve got to really start taking care of each other. There’s got to be something in your mind that says, ‘I shouldn’t be hitting this guy in his head and leading with my head.’“That’s the biggest thing, players taking ownership. You can only put pads so many places. You can only make so many rules without hurting the integrity of the game.”Jets fullback Tony Richardson agreed that players needed to do some soul searching about the way they played the game.Unfortunately, compassion is a luxury afforded only to veterans who have earned their stripes — often by not being so compassionate earlier in their careers. And compassion is especially difficult at a critical juncture of the season.“When I was young, I was hitting everything moving,” Richardson, 37, said. “Over a period of time, when you’ve been in the league for a long period of time, you understand how precious it is to still be in the National Football League. You realize that people probably had an opportunity to take you out. As you get older, you realize it’s not necessary.“At the end of the day, we’re all brothers in this league.”A noble, novel concept that needs to be dusted off and reintroduced.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','The couple met in March 2007 the old-fashioned way — set up by their maternal grandmothers, who were in the same Yiddish club at their retirement community in Monroe Township.Jeannie Austein, Ms. Gold’s grandmother, gave a presentation that drew from a local newspaper profile of Ms. Gold that included a photograph of her surrounded by the company’s line of mustards in squeeze bottles. After the talk, Ruth Moskowitz, Mr. Gottlieb’s grandmother, could not resist mentioning that she had a handsome, eligible grandson, and asked if Ms. Gold was single.After some back and forth, Mrs. Austein handed over her granddaughter’s work number, which was fine with Ms. Gold, who said, “I would go out with anyone once.”When Mr. Gottlieb called, the two hit it off, Ms. Gold recalled. But when he did not call again she confessed to being puzzled.Mr. Gottlieb explained that he didn’t think she was interested in him, so he hadn’t bothered calling.Ms. Gold, though, knew there was something there, and sent him an e-mail message about a month later. When they met later at an East Side bar, she was too nervous to sit down. So they stood — for more than two hours.“Something told me that this is for real,” Mr. Gottlieb said.She was a little ahead of him. “As soon as I saw him I knew he was the one,” she said.When he called her at the office the next day to tell her he wanted to hear her voice, she was astonished.“Why would he want to hear my voice?” Ms. Gold said. “I have the most annoying voice.”They met again a couple weeks later, after Passover (Ms. Gold’s busy season with stepped-up horseradish production) was over. After becoming an item a couple of months later, their grandmothers met them together for the first time. “They both had the biggest smiles on their faces,” Ms. Gold said.“It was a very priceless moment,” Mr. Gottlieb agreed. His grandmother, Mrs. Moskowitz, has since died, but he remembered her saying that day, “Please don’t cry when I’m not around anymore. I want you to live for your happiness.”'"

"'09-11-15,'0','“It’s a kind of year you put down the book on and don’t want to open it again,” said Bob Stuart, who has run his family’s farm in Granite Springs since 1972.“I’ve been keeping statistics since 1999,” he said. “I’ve seen wetter Mays and I’ve seen wetter Junes, but not consistently four months in a row.”On the lucky end, he didn’t get a repeat of the hail that took out half his crop in 2008, although it did come within a half-mile of the 181-year-old farm on which Mr. Stuart has about 70 cultivated acres.Most of it is fruit trees — mainly 3,500 apple trees. He said they did wonderfully, though his vegetables did not.The tomatoes came in late, and then he lost many to an early freeze. His string beans just didn’t grow. He lost zucchini to disease brought on by rain, and he couldn’t even get into the fields to plant pumpkins. “We tried to get the tractor in and it got stuck,” he said.Then came the late-season problem — plenty of apples but rainy weekends at harvest time, which meant fruit sales at the farm store suffered. And he said profits would be even further off because of the cost of additional spraying, which was about 30 percent higher than in the past.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','It’s tempting — very tempting — to share some of the laugh lines in the play Craig Wright has so tellingly named “Mistakes Were Made.” But it would be a mistake. Without the desperate delivery of the star of the Hartford Stage production, Will LeBow, the jokes would lose much of their zing. So I will refrain from quoting the text and quote the set instead.Walt Spangler has designed a snazzy office with good furniture, a large bubbly fish tank and a wall covered with theatrical poster cards promoting fatuous extravaganzas like Scott Baio and Gene Simmons in “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” Suzanne Somers in “Medea,” Danny DeVito as Othello and Bea Arthur as Cleopatra.If you are not giggling, “Mistakes Were Made” may not be for you. Its humor is anchored in the ridiculous end of the theatrical spectrum: dim-bulb actors, intransigent playwrights and predatory agents, all seemingly born to thwart the ambitions of the irascible, Tums-chewing producer whose proudest moments are on those posters and whose high-octane telephone conversations are going to entertain us for the 90-minute duration of Mr. Wright’s play.The producer, Felix Artifex, finds himself at a crossroads. An earnest, unheralded young Midwesterner has sent him a play so remarkable that Felix believes it could render his weak résumé moot and add his name to the short list of commercial theater producers who have, perhaps in spite of themselves, advanced the art.Mr. LeBow, natty in well-cut tweed jacket and wool slacks (Alejo Vietti is the costume designer), has an uncanny ability to show us that Felix’s mind and Felix’s mouth are not always in sync. Whether he is on the phone flattering, cajoling or flat-out cursing the person on the other end, it is always in the service of some larger goal, generally one that will benefit Felix. In the funniest case, he wants to lure a vain, uncomprehending movie star into doing the new play — about the French Revolution and called, of course, “Mistakes Were Made.” In the most heartfelt scenario, he is trying to reconnect with his estranged ex-wife by admitting that, yes, he made mistakes. And in the most farcical plot element, which will become the grimmest, he needs to untangle a mess in a distant war-torn country that sounds very much like Iraq to salvage an unfortunate investment involving 1,000 sheep and a sheep-dip facility. Needless to say, mistakes were made there, too.For all its echoes of show-business satires like “The Producers,” “Speed-the-Plow” and even “Entourage,” this play has more than the foibles of the entertainment industry on its mind. If the Middle East allusions aren’t clear enough — and, in fact, they aren’t very clear — the title alone should tell the story. That all-purpose nonapology apology, which we first heard from the Nixon administration during Watergate, has been trotted out since then nearly every time a president makes a mess. Felix is good at making messes, too.Working under the direction of Hartford Stage’s associate artistic director, Jeremy B. Cohen, Mr. LeBow is giving two expert performances. He shows us Felix’s antic scrambling to keep his project, and his life, afloat. Through Mr. LeBow’s reactions, we also see the characters he is talking to on the telephone, though we never hear them.'"
"'09-11-15,'0','As the founder and editor of the blog Feministing.com, how would you rate the effectiveness of online activism compared to old-style models of political engagement like rallies and marches and displays of bra-burning? Bra-burning never happened. It was completely made up by the media. A couple of women protesting a Miss America pageant threw some bras into a garbage can, and somehow that became this longstanding idea of feminists as bra-burners.You’re referring to the generation known as second-wave feminists. Do you consider yourself a third-wave feminist? I don’t much like the terminology, because it never seems very accurate to me. I know people who are considered third-wave feminists who are 20 years older than me.Maybe we’re onto the fourth wave now. Maybe the fourth wave is online.How large is your readership?This past month we had over 600,000 readers. Unless there’s some feminist publication I’m unaware of, we’re the most widely read feminist publication that there is.What publications are you comparing yourself with?There’s Ms. magazine and there’s Bitch.

"'09-11-15,'0','Until recently, the TV business was shielded from the turmoil that the Internet has visited upon other media industries, like music and publishing. The reason was largely a matter of network capacity. Sending high-quality video through the Web requires a lot more bandwidth than sending text or music, and until 2007 most Americans lacked high-speed Internet connections at home, according to the Pew Research Center. The Net simply wasn’t a viable alternative for distributing the signals traditionally sent over cables or beamed down from satellites.That’s changing, and fast. With broadband becoming the norm and connection speeds continuing to quicken, what has happened to music companies and newspapers is beginning to happen to broadcast networks and cable companies. People like me are using the Net to bypass the customary providers of television programming, along with the ads they show and the fees they collect.My Blu-ray player is just the tip of the iceberg that the TV business is about to hit. Today you can watch snippets of shows on YouTube or entire episodes on sites like Hulu or Yahoo TV. You can view news reports at CNN.com, sports events at ESPN360.com and documentaries at PBS.org. You can download shows, sometimes without charge, from Apple’s iTunes store and watch them on your iPod, iPhone or PC. Or you can stream them through your Xbox or Wii.Television is escaping the TV set and the cable box. We no longer watch the tube. We watch, to borrow ex-Senator Ted Stevens’s memorable conceit, a series of tubes.As the technology of television changes, so, too, does the experience of watching it. In the past, TVs often served as the focal points of communal gatherings. Families or groups of friends would collect around the set to watch the prime-time shows or the weekend games. They would laugh at the sitcom slapstick, cheer for their local teams, chat through commercials and, during the duller stretches, keep one another from nodding off. TV may have been a vast wasteland, as Newton Minow, the F.C.C. chairman in the Kennedy administration, said in a speech in 1961, but at least it was a wasteland we shared.The communal mode of TV viewing isn’t gone, but it’s becoming less common. As screens proliferate and shrink, and as the Web allows us to view whatever we want whenever we want, we spend more time watching video alone. That’s one funny thing about the Internet: it’s an extraordinarily rich communications system, but as an information and entertainment medium, it encourages private consumption. The pictures and sounds served up through our PCs, iPods and smart phones absorb us deeply but in isolation. Even when we’re together today, we’re often apart, peering into our own screens.Television companies, desperate to protect their sources of revenue, are trying to figure out ways to control or at least influence the shifts in our viewing practices. If a transmission company like Comcast — although it owns a few cable stations, Comcast’s main business is providing cable TV, Internet and telephone service — were to own more of the programs it distributes, it could, at least theoretically, wield more power over how that content reaches viewers. In buying NBC Universal, for instance, Comcast would gain a stake in Hulu, which NBC owns with ABC and Fox. It could impose limits or even fees on the shows streamed through that popular Web site.Such opportunities reveal the conflict of interest that’s built into the TV business. The companies that supply us with pay-TV subscriptions — not just cable operators like Comcast but telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon — also tend to be the ones that provide us with Internet service. By blocking or slowing certain Net transmissions, they could shunt us toward their own programming and prevent us from viewing alternatives, particularly free ones. If my Internet provider degraded my Netflix signal, I would almost certainly go back to watching more cable programs.That scenario is not as far-fetched as it may sound. In 2007, Comcast was caught throttling back its customers’ links to BitTorrent, a file-sharing network often used to trade bootleg copies of TV shows and movies. Comcast argues that heavy BitTorrent users were taking up too much bandwidth, to the detriment of other services. Looked at another way, Comcast was using its Web-access franchise to protect its pay-TV franchise.But, as the company soon found out, impinging on “net neutrality” — the principle that Internet providers should treat all data the same — is a good way to make enemies. Internet purists went ballistic. Consumer advocates denounced the move. The government began an investigation. In 2008, the F.C.C. decided that Comcast had broken its rules, and it ordered the company not to impede access to BitTorrent and other such services. Comcast is appealing the ruling.Under its new chairman, the Obama-appointee Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. is becoming even more aggressive in defending the openness of the Internet. Last month, it voted to begin preparing regulations aimed at giving net neutrality the force of law. Though controversial, the commission’s move will be welcomed by most Web users. I know that I don’t want my Internet provider to control the sites I visit or services I can use when I’m online. Unimpeded access to the Net has come to feel like a right.In the end, and whether they gobble up content producers or not, network operators like Comcast may be fated to be in the plumbing business. They’ll turn tidy profits by maintaining the pipes through which we get Internet service, even if we use those pipes to bypass their pay-TV offerings. We’ll go on gorging ourselves on free Internet video. We, the viewers, will be the winners.Or will we?The smartest, most creative TV shows, from “Deadwood” to “Mad Men” to NBC’s own “30 Rock,” tend to be the most expensive to produce. They have large, talented casts, top-notch writers and directors, elaborate sets and generally high production values. If the changes in our viewing habits stanch the flow of money back to studios, producing those kinds of programs may no longer be possible. In their place, we’ll get more junk: dopey reality shows, cookie-cutter police dramas, inane gab fests. The vast wasteland will become even vaster.'"

That makes the returns on our investment — in the form of clean water, clean air and much more — even higher than usual.President Obama’s increased appropriation of open-space funds takes advantage of this logic. The value of these investments resonates across party lines.

"'09-11-16,'1','But the campaign for science comes as the university experiences record enrollment across its campuses and also as the economy founders. Some faculty members worry that the laserlike focus on science will divert money from more mundane but pressing needs, like classroom space, while others wonder whether government financing and private philanthropy can be sustained to see the plan through to fruition.The thrust in the sciences follows a decade in which CUNY sought to reverse a long period of wrenching decline by strengthening its admissions standards, increasing enrollment and hiring faculty. In many ways, the science push is an attempt to play catch-up.“CUNY fell behind other campuses for decades,” said John H. Marburger III, the science adviser to President George W. Bush and now a professor of physics and electrical engineering at Stony Brook University. “Thirty years of open admissions, fiscal crises and an awkward administrative arrangement for research and graduate education inhibited what might have been the normal growth of federally funded research.”But Dr. Marburger said he was struck by the “determination and thoughtfulness” of CUNY’s investments in science. “CUNY has always had faculty who rank with the best, but the system was not organized to provide an attractive research environment,” he said. “That seems to be changing.”Others outside the university have also applauded CUNY’s science initiative. “The thing that impresses me about the CUNY plan is that it’s strategic,” said Ellis Rubinstein, president and chief executive of the New York Academy of Sciences, a nonprofit group with 24,000 members.“It’s picked some very key core areas that are not just curiosity-driven research, which is what we often see,” he said. “It’s mission-oriented. There’s no issue that will be bigger or more dramatic of a challenge in our world than water.”Mr. Rubinstein was referring to one of the research areas to be addressed in the 200,000-square-foot Advanced Science Research Center, now under construction: water and environmental sensing. Last year, CUNY lured Charles J. Vörösmarty away from the University of New Hampshire, where for more than three decades he taught and researched the threats to water resources around the world.Dr. Vörösmarty said he was impressed by the transformation CUNY was trying to engineer in such a compressed time frame. “I was courted by some other places, but it’s different here,” he said. “Other places might plug a gap in their capability. But this is a serious enterprise, and they want to get it right.”Dr. Vörösmarty, a professor of civil engineering who now heads CUNY’s Environmental Crossroads Initiative, praised the interdisciplinary potential of the new research center, which was designed with an open plan to allow the free flow of people and ideas. Dr. Vörösmarty and his colleagues will have the top floor.Still, there are some misgivings about the rapid expansion in the sciences, even among CUNY scientists. Manfred Philipp, a chemist at Lehman College and chairman of the University Faculty Senate, said he was “overjoyed” that the administration was finally giving science its due, especially at a university that counts 10 Nobel laureates in science and medicine among its alumni. “We were often working in labs dating to the 1930s and ’40s that were totally out of date,” he said.But the Advanced Science Research Center was conceived, he said, before the current boom in enrollment. “There is a concern that the level of investment in the center may have an effect on our investment in actual classroom space,” he said. “It’s clear that the center will not touch on the lives of undergraduates.”Gillian M. Small, CUNY’s vice chancellor for research, estimated the capital investment in the new and renovated science buildings at more than a billion dollars. “It’s the most expensive discipline to support,” she said.Still, it is unclear when, and whether, the focus on sciences will bring CUNY to a place of national and international competitiveness. “It’s trying to come back and making valiant efforts to do that,” said Sanjoy Banerjee, distinguished professor of chemical engineering, who was hired from the University of California, Santa Barbara, last year to head the university’s new energy institute.“We’ve chosen the areas well,” he said. “But it’s an uphill battle. Losing 20 or 30 years is hard to make up.”In the meantime, CUNY will advance the cause of science in ways large and small. Dr. Banerjee is among the professors who stepped outside the esoteric discourse of their fields at the Kouzan restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue. “In some ways, people are scared of science,” said Dr. Small, who started the science cafe series last year. “If you can make it more amenable to people, they can come in on their way home from work and have a glass of wine and have the opportunity for a lot of interaction.”'"

"'09-11-16,'1','A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after Congress added drug benefits to a few years ago, giving tens of millions of older Americans federally subsidized drug . Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years.“They try to maximize their profits,” Mr. Newhouse said.But drug companies say they are having to raise prices to maintain the profits necessary to invest in research and development of new drugs as the patents on many of their most popular drugs are set to expire over the next few years.“Price adjustments for our products have no connection to ,” said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for , which raised its prices about 8.9 percent in the last year, according to a stock analyst’s report.This year’s increases mean the average annual cost for a brand-name prescription drug that is taken daily would be more than $2,000 — $200 higher than last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said.And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster. Merck, for example, now sells daily 10-milligram pills of Singulair, the blockbuster drug, at a wholesale price of $1,330 a year — $147 more than last year. Singulair is now selling at retail, on , for nearly $1,478 a year.The drug companies “can charge what they want — it’s not fair,” Eric White, the 42-year-old owner of a small jewelry store in , said as he left a pharmacy recently.Despite having drug insurance, Mr. White says he now pays $110 a month out of pocket for two brand-name allergy medicines, even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door.He shook his head. “What can I do?” he said. “I need my medicines.”The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost-cutting provisions in the House legislation, which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $14 billion a year over a decade.But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $8 billion a year — $80 billion over 10 years — from the nation’s drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government. That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks.But this year’s price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement. And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10-year deal.“It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $80 billion because they’ll be making more money,” said Steven D. Findlay, senior health care analyst with the advocacy group .Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. But name brands account for 78 percent of total prescription drug spending in this country. And as long as a name-brand drug still has patent protection it faces no price competition from generics., senior vice president of the industry association — the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — criticized the analysis Professor Schondelmeyer had conducted for AARP, saying it was politically motivated.“In AARP’s skewed view of the world, medicines are always looked at as a cost and never seen as a savings — even though medicines often reduce unnecessary hospitalization, help avoid costly medical procedures and increase productivity through better prevention and management of chronic diseases,” he said.But Professor Schondelmeyer’s analysis — which found prices for the name-brand drugs most widely used by the Medicare population rising by 9.3 percent in the last year, the fastest rate since 1992 — is in line with the findings of a leading Wall Street analyst, too. The report was released on Monday.Catherine J. Arnold, a drug industry analyst at , said her latest study of the nation’s eight biggest pharmaceutical companies showed markedly similar results: list prices rising an average of 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 — the highest rate of growth since at least 2004.As does Professor Schondelmeyer, Ms. Arnold based her price calculations on reported wholesale prices and a formula that puts more emphasis on each company’s best-selling drugs.Ms. Arnold said the prospect of cost containment under health care reform, as well as the tougher business environment, entered into the decisions of manufacturers to raise prices this year.The industry stands to gain about 30 million customers with drug insurance from the legislation pending in Congress. But the industry also faces the prospect of tougher negotiations from both public and private buyers as the government tries to squeeze savings out of the health system.“If you’re going to take price increases,” Ms. Arnold said, “here and now might be the place to do that, because the next year and the year after that might be tough.”Mr. Johnson did not dispute the Credit Suisse study or deny Ms. Arnold’s finding that American drug makers have raised prices at the fastest rate in five years.He said both studies were incomplete by failing to include rebates that drug makers give distributors. But Ms. Arnold, Professor Schondelmeyer and a 2007 Congressional study of Medicare said the rebates often accrue to the middlemen, not consumers, and higher manufacturer prices lead to higher retail prices.And the drug industry’s own major consulting firm, , has also reported a significant run-up in prices. Back in April, IMS predicted that drug sales might actually decline this year., president of the industry’s trade association, highlighted the gloomy prediction in a June 1 letter to President Obama shortly before striking the deal to cut drug costs by $80 billion. In negotiating the deal, the drug makers argued that they could not afford to give up more than that.But in October, IMS made an unusual change in the middle of its forecasting cycle, saying it now believed United States sales would grow at least 4.5 percent in 2009 — or $21 billion more than expected six months earlier.A major reason, IMS said, was higher-than-expected price increases for drugs in the United States.'"
"'09-11-16,'1','“But much of the recovery has been thanks to government spending, so we’ll most likely see growth slow going forward,” Mr. Haji said. “It’s too soon to say we’re out of the woods.”Strong investment by companies helped drive the recovery. Capital spending rose a better-than-expected 1.6 percent in the quarter, the first gain in a year and a half. Exports grew 6.4 percent, helped by stimulus spending by governments around the world, which has led to a recovery in global trade.Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, climbed 0.7 percent, propped up by more than 20 trillion yen in stimulus spending by Japan. In particular, government incentives on purchases of energy-efficient appliances and cars have bolstered sales at companies like Toyota Motor and Sony.Citing increases in demand, manufacturers like Toyota and Nissan recently upgraded their earnings forecasts for the fiscal year. Still, Japan’s exporters remain under pressure from the strong yen, which makes their products less competitive overseas and erodes profits in the home currency.The recent expansion goes only so far to make up for ground lost in the global downturn. Though Japan’s banks were not at the epicenter of the financial crisis, the country suffered as demand for its exports collapsed, wiping out a full five years of economic growth.Industrial production still remains a fifth off last year’s levels, and unemployment, at 5.3 percent, is close to a record high. Deflation is back in full force, eroding profits and wages.And despite the frailty of Japan’s recovery, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has been fiercely critical of further spending on public works. His Democratic Party of Japan, which swept to a landslide victory in August, has blocked 2.9 trillion yen ($32.4 billion) in stimulus measures introduced by the departing government and could hold on to the funds until next year.Instead, Mr. Hatoyama says he plans to divert the money toward social welfare spending, like subsidizing child care and lowering tuition fees at schools. His deputy, Naoto Kan, said on Monday that the government could outline an extra budget for this year that focuses on support for workers and the environment.But while better safety nets could ease the blow of high unemployment and help raise the birthrate, economists say those measures would take time to carry out and to take effect — and such a delay could hurt economic recovery in the short term.“As the Democrats move from investment in concrete to investment in people, a smooth transition will be key,” said Mr. Haji of NLI. “Any public works money not spent now is a direct loss to the economy. We could see a slight slump before the Democrats’ measures kick in.”Critics also warn that Mr. Hatoyama’s programs could be detrimental to Japan’s rising debt, which is approaching twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. Last week, the Fitch Ratings agency warned that it would review its rating on Japan’s public debt if the government failed to rein in spending.Uncertainty over Japan’s economic recovery has weighed on Tokyo’s Nikkei index, which has fallen 1.8 percent since the start of July, despite a rebound in corporate profits.'"
"'09-11-16,'1','The Treasury Department opened its doors to economic bloggers this month, and the meeting was productive in at least one respect: as John Jansen of the blog Across the Curve concluded, “After meeting them, I feel I cannot refer to them as Timothy Geithner and his minions” anymore.Mr. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, was among the senior officials who talked with bloggers at an outreach session on Nov. 2. The two-hour round table was held on background, meaning that the bloggers could describe the sessions, but not attribute quotes to specific officials. Lengthy posts about financial system reforms — and the bloggers’ disagreements with the Treasury’s strategies — ensued.New-media scribes have gradually made their way inside most governmental institutions over the years, but the meeting was the first for bloggers at the Treasury. Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University who has written at the Marginal Revolution blog for six years, said it was the first time he had heard from any Treasury official.The meeting “shows that the Obama administration is working very hard on outreach to a lot of different media sources,” he said.The Treasury invited about 20 bloggers. Eight attended — at their own expense — including some ardent critics of the department. Michael J. Panzner, who writes the Financial Armageddon blog, said the invitation “was totally out of the blue.”Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury who assembled the event, said that Mr. Geithner had “long valued the blogosphere” and mentioned that during Mr. Geithner’s tenure as the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, he had requested a daily compendium of relevant blog posts.'"
"'09-11-16,'1','Last fall there was a sense of panic because nobody knew if prices had hit bottom, not just for art but for any asset, and even the richest collectors froze. This season was all about the estimates. “Ultimately that’s what provided buyers with the confidence to bid,” said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of Sotheby’s contemporary art department, who added that for some artists, prices have dropped more than 40 percent from their high two years ago.The deliberately low estimates became catnip for bidders. Or so it seemed when Warhol’s 1962 silkscreen painting “200 One Dollar Bills” incited a bidding war among five collectors and ultimately sold for a staggering $43.7 million (including Sotheby’s fees), more than three times its $12 million high estimate.Would what proved to be the star of the last two weeks have made more at the peak of the market? No, said both Mr. Meyer and Mr. Porter. Mr. Meyer pointed out that during the boom, big money went for highly colorful images like a 1976 triptych by Francis Bacon ($86.3 million in May 2008) and a Rothko canvas, the 1950 “White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose),” from the collection of the retired banker David Rockefeller ($72.8 million in 2007).“Because this Warhol is black and white, it could have very well been overlooked at the height of the market,” Mr. Meyer said. “Although it is art-historically important, it takes a little knowledge to appreciate.”It also took a sophisticated collector to realize that the 1962 image was rare and few like it come up for sale. Or to appreciate the luster of its provenance: it had once belonged to Robert C. Scull, the taxi tycoon who amassed a world-class collection of Pop and Minimalist art. When it was offered for sale at Sotheby’s in 1986, the year Mr. Scull died, Pauline Karpidas, a London collector, bought it for $385,000, then a record price for a Warhol at auction. Yet when she decided to sell it 23 years later, the high estimate of $12 million seemed cheap. And that enticed buyers.Another perceived bargain was a Giacometti bronze, “L’Homme Qui Chavire” (or “Falling Man,” conceived in 1950) at Sotheby’s. A similar sculpture brought $18.5 million at Christie’s in 2007. The seller of this season’s work, S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate who owns Condé Nast, bought it from a London gallery for more than $20 million. He spent a year trying to sell it privately through Gagosian and then Christie’s. Its price went from $22 million to $18 million, and Mr. Newhouse ended up consigning it to Sotheby’s, where it was estimated at $12 million tops. Six collectors, thinking it seemed cheap, bid it up and the sculpture wound up selling for $17.2 million, or $19.3 million, including Sotheby’s fees.At Christie’s a group of paintings and drawings that were presents to the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, who died in July, and his partner in life and work, John Cage, who died in 1992, were also priced low despite their celebrated past. Jasper Johns’s “Dancers on a Plane” (1980-81) brought $4.3 million (including fees), more than $2 million above its high estimate, and a drawing of clocks by Robert Rauschenberg made more than six times its high estimate, selling for $780,000 ($938,500 with fees).“We had 10 to 15 active bidders on it,” Mr. Porter said. “I hadn’t seen that since the boom. It may have been lower priced, but nearly $1 million for a drawing is still real money for anybody.”With art prices readily available at Artnet.com, collectors can easily do their homework. So if something appears too expensive, it often fails to sell without a bid. That was the case with “Brother Sausage,” a six-panel painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat at Christie’s that was estimated at $9 million to $12 million.Of the two auction giants, Sotheby’s came out the winner this season in total sales because it had secured several prized properties and was able to price them conservatively. Its Impressionist and modern art sale featured a group of paintings that had belonged to the fabled Paris dealer Paul Durand-Ruel as well as works from Arthur M. Sackler, a leading collector who died in 1987.But if any one artist dominated the auctions it was Warhol. Besides “200 One Dollar Bills,” several of his drawings made strong prices. And a 1965 self-portrait by the artist that was expected to bring a high of $1.5 million at Sotheby’s sold for $5.4 million ($6.1 million with fees) to Laurence Graff, the London jeweler.Who bought “200 One Dollar Bills” remains a mystery. That element, guessing who is actually paying, is part of the magic of auctions. Officials at Sotheby’s and Christie’s said there were buyers from Russia and Asia — parts of the world that were barely represented six months ago — as well as the United States.But only the auction house knows for sure who took home the $43.7 million Warhol. Some dealers said it might have been Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager who collects contemporary art like Damien Hirst’s famous shark, or Philip Niarchos, the contemporary-art collector who is a member of the Greek shipping family. Others said it was a Russian oligarch like Roman Abramovich, who is said to have bought the $86.3 million Bacon triptych. Or maybe even Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian billionaire and contemporary art collector. And if it was Mr. Pinchuk, will “200 One Dollar Bills” be on view at his art foundation in Kiev?'"
"'09-11-16,'1','After a quiet stretch at the North American box office, Hollywood discovered once again that audiences want to see the world and a cast of B-list actors ripped into pieces in a blitz of computer-generated effects.“2012,” Roland Emmerich’s thriller about a global cataclysm, opened at No. 1 with a higher-than-expected $65 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada, according to the tracking service Hollywood.com. Sony, which released the movie, estimated that it raked in an additional $160 million overseas, making the first weekend for “2012” one of the biggest of the year.It is rare for a movie not based on a pre-existing brand, franchise or hit novel to deliver such robust results. Sony said “2012,” with a budget of $200 million, had the highest worldwide opening ever for an original movie.Sony, which has now opened eight movies in a row in first place, pushed the picture with a marketing campaign that highlighted its summeresque qualities: big, nonthinking, rip-’em-up popcorn fare. (Most reviews have been negative.) In the latest example of the studio’s forward-thinking promotional campaigns, the first wave of billboards simply read, “Search: 2012.” Sony knew that a raft of links about the doomsday date often attributed to the Maya would pop up in Google.At the other end of the spectrum the tiny independent film “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” the story of a Harlem girl who is brutally abused by her parents, played to sold-out theaters in limited release, selling about $6.1 million for a new total of $8.9 million.If that strong pace keeps up when this Lionsgate film opens nationwide on Friday, it could blossom into a substantial hit, an enormous feat given the subject matter. Lee Daniels directed the film, with Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry lending promotional backing.“Disney’s A Christmas Carol” benefited from moviegoers who seemed more in a holiday spirit than when the movie opened to disappointing results last weekend. The movie, directed by Robert Zemeckis, was second, selling a solid $22.3 million for a new total of $63.3 million.'"

"'09-11-17,'1','“I’d be lying to you if I didn’t say I have some concerns,” said Tom Renney, his coach then. “But in no way, shape or form am I surprised that he’s continuing to pursue his dream, and I’m proud of him for it.”Ortmeyer wears extra padding on the ice and compression socks when he travels. He must monitor his diet. To check for clots, he has monthly ultrasound examinations on his legs and abdomen. He times his injections so the medication, which is legal in the N.H.L., is theoretically out of his system when he plays, a plan Morrissey said was not guaranteed to be safe.“You want them to be covered 24/7, not take a holiday for six hours a day,” he said. “That six hours is when you are potentially at risk.”Ortmeyer averages about 13 minutes a game, mostly on third-line shifts, in his first season with the Sharks and has four goals and two assists. He stands out with energy and hard work, so his production rarely shows up on a score sheet.The first N.H.L. player from Nebraska since 1925, Ortmeyer grew up in Omaha, where hockey has a devoted following but trails college football and baseball. He and Jake became the first local players for Omaha’s junior team, the Lancers of the United States Hockey League.“Youth hockey has grown tremendously because the kids could see that even though they weren’t from Minnesota or they weren’t from the East Coast, they still had a chance, and they could look up to Jed,” said Roseanne Gyhra, who housed Lancers for 13 years.Ortmeyer went on to play for the University of Michigan, helping the Wolverines reach the Frozen Four in three of his four years. He was the team captain and most valuable player his final two seasons.The first sign of his ailment appeared when he developed a blood clot after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, but doctors assumed it was a complication from surgery. Ortmeyer resumed his college career, although he later tore his left anterior cruciate ligament.“He didn’t come in with a lot of fanfare, so you didn’t know if he was going to continue to develop,” said Red Berenson, Michigan’s coach for 26 seasons. “But he just found a way to become a better player. If you had to measure him in terms of will and work ethic, it would be hard to put anyone ahead of him.”That was why the Rangers signed the undrafted Ortmeyer in 2003. He soon became a fan favorite.“He was one of those guys that would block shots,” Renney said. “He always put himself in harm’s way. And I think you know that’s kind of New York, isn’t it?”In August 2006, Ortmeyer had chest pains; he said his arms ached and went numb.“I just thought I was overtraining or pulled something, and then I started coughing up blood,” he said.Emergency room doctors in New York discovered the embolism. Being young and in shape might have saved Ortmeyer, Morrissey said.“Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common causes of sudden death in this country, so he was in a life-threatening situation,” Morrissey said.Ortmeyer was treated and returned home that night. He was found to have one of several inherited blood disorders, which Morrissey said affect 5 percent to 9 percent of the general population.“At first it wasn’t about whether or not he should keep playing, it was about how, thank God, he’s still alive,” Jake Ortmeyer said.Soon after, a filter was surgically inserted in the main vein in his abdomen to keep clots from traveling to his heart and lungs, and he began taking blood thinners.The 6-foot, 188-pound Ortmeyer returned to the Rangers six months later and helped them reach the second round of the playoffs in 2007. Fans chose him to receive the team’s Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award for the second time.“The encouragement that I got from the fans, and the reception I got when I did come back was amazing,” he said. “It gives you a lot more energy and excitement every day when you come out on the ice at Madison Square.”But he became a free agent and signed a two-year contract with the Nashville Predators in July 2007. He tore his A.C.L. for the third time in February 2008 and missed the rest of the season. When he developed another clot after surgery, doctors urged him to stop playing.This summer, however, he signed a one-year deal with the Sharks, who lead the Pacific Division.“He’s a pretty astute player,” Sharks Coach Todd McLellan said. “He understands what we want to do and how we want to do it. I don’t know that he’s skilled enough or fast enough or strong enough to rely on any one of those three skills, so he puts it all together and becomes a usable part.”When Ortmeyer scored during a victory against the Rangers on Oct. 19, his first game against his former team, many in the Garden crowd cheered.Manny Malhotra, a former Ranger who was his linemate that night, said: “I’m just blown away by all the things that he’s gone through, the road back to recovery, the things that go through his mind every day. That’s one thing you’ll never question is his desire to want to be out there and his desire to play.”Berenson, Ortmeyer’s college coach, said he had mixed feelings.“I’m impressed with his will to play and his love of the game, but I just hope that he’s not taking any unnecessary risks,” he said.But Ortmeyer says he just wants people to remember what he has given to the game, not his sacrifices.“I feel like this is what I’ve always wanted to do,” he said. “I feel like I can still compete and play and contribute, so it wasn’t time for me to sit on the sidelines.”'"

"'09-11-17,'1','Paul Allen, a private investor and co-founder of Microsoft, has been told he has non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, according to an e-mail message sent to employees of his investment firm, Vulcan.This month, Mr. Allen, 56, received the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a relatively common form of lymphoma, according to the message, sent by Jody Allen, Vulcan’s chief executive and Mr. Allen’s sister.Mr. Allen received a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease in 1983, and left Microsoft for radiation therapy and a bone marrow transplant. He never returned to the company’s day-to-day operations, but his stock in the rapidly growing software firm made him the 17th richest man in the United States, according to Forbes magazine’s annual list.“This is tough news for Paul and the family,” wrote Ms. Allen. “Paul is feeling O.K. and remains upbeat. He continues to work and he has no plans to change his role at Vulcan. His health comes first, though, and we’ll be sure that nothing intrudes on that.”In recent years, Mr. Allen has become known as one of the most aggressive and inconsistent investors in technology. Apart from his ownership stakes in sport teams like the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers, Mr. Allen invested heavily in Charter Communications, the cable company, and Digeo, which made set-top boxes. Both companies sought bankruptcy protection this year.Mr. Allen also financed Space Ship One, a rocket-powered aircraft that in 2004 became the first privately financed human flight to reach suborbital space.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','Peggy Allgood, a 54-year-old black woman who lost her job and four-bedroom house and is now living in a trailer park, said she had noticed the recession obliterating racial differences up and down the economic scale.“It’s gotten to the point where everyone I talk to, their hours have been cut, their jobs have been cut,” Ms. Allgood said. “My neighbor, she’s white, she’s trying to find a job. She hasn’t had any luck.”The recession hit Henry County, for years one of the nation’s fastest growing areas, at a time when it was already struggling to come to terms with startling demographic change. In 1990, the county was almost 90 percent white. Now, as its population has more than tripled to 192,000, according to 2008 census estimates, the white percentage of the population has shrunk to 60 percent.The county’s elected government is still all white and Republican, and some leaders and newcomers alike have tried in various ways to make local board and governments more diverse. But nothing else has worked to remove barriers as quickly as economic hardship.“There used to be a lot of racial tension here, but everybody knows that we need each other to survive this recession,” said Eugene Edwards, the president of the Henry County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “People now, they seem to be starting to care for one another.”Once fueled by construction, the county has been left by the recession with a blighted crop of abandoned white utility hookups, meant for new subdivisions, sprouted in the woods.Last year, the Chamber of Commerce took a multiracial group of leaders to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, but such officially sponsored efforts at bonding have slowed.“The recession has pretty much tied folks down to survival mode,” said Steve Cash, the executive director of the Henry Council for Quality Growth, who is white. “A lot of things that were happening before aren’t happening now.”And a lot of things that were unheard of before are happening now. Women in Jaguars pull up to the local food pantry, and former millionaires hunker down in grand, unsellable homes.One reason blacks have not gained more political power is that they are not heavily concentrated in any single area in the county — the cul-de-sacs carved out of farmland and pastures in the last decade became racially mixed enclaves for the upwardly mobile. Now, the foreclosure notices and uncut lawns in those same subdivisions reinforce the notion that everyone is in the same sinking boat.Statistics also suggest that the recession’s burden is falling with similar force on both races. In June 2006, 55 percent of the families receiving food stamps were black, and 44 percent were white. Those percentages remain the same today, although the size of each group has increased by about 50 percent.Unemployment claims follow that pattern: in January 2008, 49 percent of those who filed for unemployment were white, and 45 percent were black. In August 2009, 49 percent were white, and 48 percent were black.Across the country, there have been many reports about the recession’s racial divide, as blacks have lost their jobs and houses at far higher rates than whites. But Henry County, about a 30-minute drive south of downtown Atlanta, has a very different profile from the rest of the nation. In Henry, the median income of black families, $56,715 in 2008, approaches that of whites, $69,728 (nationally, the average income gap was $20,000). Blacks in Henry County, many of whom are retirees from the North or professionals who work in Atlanta, are more likely than whites to have a college degree.That does not mean that Henry County is a perfect laboratory of equality. Blacks made up a disproportionately high number of those seeking government assistance both before and after the slowdown. Since 2006, the number of blacks on Medicaid has more than tripled, outpacing the increase among whites.And as in the rest of the country, blacks in Henry were more than twice as likely as whites to take out risky sub-prime mortgages, meaning more black families than white are struggling to keep their homes.Keith and Kenya Rucker, who are black, recently declared bankruptcy in an effort to keep the home they bought for $155,000 with an adjustable-rate mortgage when they had two incomes, before Mr. Rucker lost his job as a restaurant manager. Both said they could not rely on family members for help with their ballooning payments.“I’m not racist, but it’s harder for black men,” Mr. Rucker said, as his wife huddled with their 8-year-old daughter, KéUnica. Mr. Rucker, who is from Orlando, Fla., echoed many experts who say that middle-class blacks have fewer resources, either financial or social, to fall back on if they get into trouble. “Where I’m from,” he said, “every friend that I had is a drug dealer, locked up, on drugs or dead.”But Dennis and Jenny Duncan, a white couple who once owned millions of dollars in real estate assets as former developers, felt equally stymied. Interviewed in the lavish home they built for themselves, they said the sheriff had just come to call and told them their belongings would soon be seized to satisfy debts. Unlike Ms. Rucker, neither has a college degree, making work difficult to find.The idea that the recession is an equalizer has become accepted in Henry County. Both black and white residents were hesitant to say that either race had taken a greater hit. But Ms. Taylor, the black woman who dispensed advice at the county food stamp office, said there were some notable distinctions between blacks and whites.“They’re a little weaker than we are at handling things like this,” she said, adding without rancor, “but I know they get more sympathy than we do.”'"
"'09-11-17,'1','Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the study reported that Niaspan decreased thickening of the walls of the carotid artery — which supplies blood to the brain — while Zetia had no significant impact on arterial buildup. Abbott had helped finance the study through a grant to a nonprofit foundation.Some doctors interpreted the results as a sign that they should scale back use of Zetia because it showed no benefit in reversing the narrowing of arteries.But Merck investors viewed the results with relief, analysts said, because there was no sign that Zetia made the arterial condition worse.“The market worry was for a negative result,” Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note sent to investors on Monday morning, “while the result was essentially no change for Zetia and positive results (plaque regression) for niacin.”Merck’s stock closed at $33.81 a share, up 71 cents. Abbott’s closed at $53.63, up 68 cents.Zetia has been a polarizing drug among some doctors because, while it reduces bad cholesterol, it has not yet been proved to reduce the risk of heart problems — the ultimate purpose of a cholesterol medication.Large-scale studies have proved that statins, a group of drugs that work in the liver to inhibit bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart attack. Zetia works differently, by inhibiting the absorption of bad cholesterol in the intestines. Merck is currently conducting a clinical trial to see if Zetia, when taken in combination with a statin, reduces heart problems more than taking a statin alone. But the trial, involving up to 18,000 patients, is not due to be finished until at least 2012.In the meantime, the new study is likely to heighten the debate raging among some physicians over Zetia and another Merck drug, Vytorin, which combines Zetia and a statin.Many physicians believe, based on previous studies of different cholesterol drugs, that lowering bad cholesterol is a known good that should lead to a reduced risk of heart problems. Meanwhile, other doctors believe that in the absence of proof that the drug benefits heart health, it would be better to increase a patient’s statin dose or add niacin to their treatment than to add Zetia.Some analysts said they would be closely monitoring drug sales to see if the new study changes prescribing patterns, but they did not predict drastic changes in fortune for Abbott or Merck.Zetia and Vytorin had sales last year of about $4.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing. Ms. Arnold forecast that a 15 percent reduction in profit of the drugs next year could result in a 14 cent decrease in earnings per share, which she said would be “manageable” for the company.Niaspan had sales last year of $786 million, Abbott says. A 10 percent increase next year in sales of Niaspan and a related drug could add 7 cents to its earnings per share, Ms. Arnold estimated.The predicted earnings changes are modest because many doctors use Zetia in a specific population group — patients with very high cholesterol who cannot tolerate taking high doses of statins because they develop muscle pain.And, doctors said, some people stop taking prescription niacin — a drug given to increase good cholesterol and decrease bad cholesterol — because it can cause an unpleasant skin-reddening reaction called flushing. Dr. Jim Stolzenbach, head of cardiovascular development at Abbott, said that less than 10 percent of patients do not tolerate Niaspan.Indeed, Kenneth C. Frazier, Merck’s president for global human health, seemed buoyant after the presentation on Monday because researchers had reported that 17 patients in the niacin arm of the study dropped out because of side effects. “That reflects the real-world experience of people using niacin,” he said as he left the auditorium.Merck is developing a niacin drug intended to reduce flushing. It has enrolled 22,000 patients in a clinical trial, to be completed in 2012, that is studying whether the drug, when combined with a statin, reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke more than taking a statin alone.But, while doctors and patients await the results of both Merck trials to find out the drugs’ impact on heart health, Pfizer has been capitalizing on the situation. It has been running full-page ads promoting the proven benefit of its statin drug Lipitor to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','And yet when I visited London two weeks ago, there wasn’t much talk of a fight at all. Indeed, most takeover experts I talked to said the deal is a fait accompli — it’s just a matter of time and the price Kraft will end up paying.The reason is that, unlike in the United States, British takeover law essentially handcuffs the board of a target company from doing anything to block a deal. No poison pills. No staggered boards. No changing the shareholder vote date. The potential for a C.E.O. or entrenched board to block a deal — or otherwise act in its own self- interest — is virtually nil. In other words, England is as close as any country gets to a true shareholder democracy. Any bid gets put to a vote, and all the board can do is offer an opinion.To many people, this is how the rest of the world should work.“I’m a majority-rules guy,” said Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. “The U.K. system is better.”Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, also said that, in theory, the British system has much to commend it. “Economists will say it is much purer,” he said. “It creates a tremendous fluidity.”So what’s not to like? Professor Sonnenfeld noted an important asterisk — that this push for shareholder democracy may create a perverse incentive system so that short-term shareholders can end up determining the long-term fate of the company. So the balance of interests becomes skewed.Indeed, one parlor game in London has been to guess how much of Cadbury’s long-term shareholder base has already sold out to arbitrageurs, whose goal is to see the company sold as quickly as possible and then move on to another deal. (That’s not to say the right strategic decision isn’t for Cadbury to be sold to Kraft, though that’s the position of Cadbury’s board.)People involved in the deal estimate that about a third of the shares have already changed hands, moving from long-term shareholders to hedge funds. Those funds, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School, “have a long-term time horizon of about 12 minutes.”If the board lacks power to weigh in on the deal, that also means nobody with any clout is looking out for other stakeholders, like employees. Most mergers never live up to their hype, resulting in lower values and fewer jobs. So the question worth asking is: Shouldn’t someone be looking further into the future?That’s been the argument of people like Martin Lipton, the takeover lawyer who invented the poison pill. He has long argued that shareholders don’t necessarily know what’s good for them, and that companies need someone looking out for their best interests. That best interest may include holding out for a higher offer, or even roping in other bidders. As a result, he has often been branded a friend of entrenched boards.Without the first-line defense of boards, shareholders may simply jump at the first bid.“It gives the company less negotiating leverage,” Professor Sonnenfeld said.That’s certainly the argument that some Cadbury insiders and bankers made to me, saying they feel helpless that their votes count for so little in this case study in shareholder democracy.There is also very little evidence that shareholder democracy works better than directors in deal-making. A number of academic studies suggest it is a wash.There will always be exceptions to every rule. Some boards make bad calls.“Look at the lost opportunity with Yahoo and Microsoft,” said Professor Sonnenfeld about the decision by Yahoo’s board to originally block Microsoft’s offer, a decision that probably lost Yahoo shareholders billions.Professor Kaplan argues that both boards and shareholders will always make mistakes, but that when shareholders are in charge, “Net-net, the shareholder wins.”And he may have a point: While Cadbury’s fate may now be in the hands of fast-money arbitrageurs, “some long-term investor had to make the decision to sell.” And selling is in itself a vote on the long-term future of the company.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','Jesse Pichel, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, called the Arizona move a “very smart strategy for the company to embrace the U.S. market and have a ‘Made in the U.S.A.’ product.”For example, he said, some federal buildings might require American-made panels. Suntech said that production from the Phoenix-area factory — whose exact location will be announced in coming weeks — would qualify as American-made.In addition, the politics of foreign manufacturing compared with domestic for renewable energy have intensified recently, with some politicians calling for more of the technologies deployed on American soil to be made at home too.This month Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the Obama administration to block stimulus money for a large wind farm in western Texas that would use turbines manufactured largely in China.Other foreign-owned solar companies, including several from Germany, have set up manufacturing plants in the United States recently.Yingli, another Chinese solar manufacturer, has also said it was looking at American sites, according to Mr. Pichel.Mr. Efird said that Arizona offered strong incentives, as well as being in the heart of the Sun Belt. “For us, Arizona sits kind of in the heart of where we see a big chunk of the future market in the U.S.,” he said. “The desert Southwest, we believe, is going to be home to some huge projects.”About 15 states, according to Mr. Efird, were initially considered as possible sites, but the final choice was between Texas and Arizona. Initially, 75 people will be employed, probably rising over time to 200, he said.Suntech would not say how much the plant would cost to build. The company has applied for a 30 percent investment tax credit from the stimulus package that applies to solar manufacturing in the United States, Mr. Efird said.Suntech has been under scrutiny because American manufacturers fear being overwhelmed by cheap Chinese panels. Suntech’s chief executive, Shi Zhengrong, told The New York Times in August that his company was selling panels to American customers for less than the cost of the materials, assembly and shipping, in order to build market share. However, he swiftly reversed those comments.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','Eleventh-hour criticism is arising over President Obama’s nomination for United States attorney in northern Iowa of a prosecutor who had a leading role in the criminal cases against hundreds of illegal immigrants arrested in a May 2008 raid at a meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa.Those cases, the broadest use to date of tough criminal charges against immigrants caught working without authorization, were emblems of a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Bush administration.In supporting the prosecutor, Stephanie Rose, Mr. Obama is following the recommendation of Senator Tom Harkin, the Democrat from Iowa who is an important ally — especially in the health care debate because he is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.Ms. Rose, a senior assistant United States attorney in the office she has been chosen to run, has also garnered support from criminal defense lawyers in Iowa, including at least 11 lawyers who defended immigrants from Postville. In those proceedings, “she exhibited a level of competence and ability that would be hard to overstate,” the lawyers wrote in a letter in April.But some defense and immigration lawyers have said that felony identity-theft charges against the immigrants were excessively harsh, that immigration lawyers were not given adequate access to their clients, and that improper contact took place between prosecutors and one judge. They contend that possible civil rights and ethical violations by prosecutors should have been investigated.“Does she stand by those tactics?” asked David Leopold, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the national immigration bar. “Would she engage again in this type of prosecution of scores of undocumented workers guilty of nothing more than civil immigration violations?”'"
"'09-11-17,'1','The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb has found a clever way to shrink. The company is offering its stockholders the chance to swap at a discount into shares of its publicly traded subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition. Reducing the number of outstanding shares would improve Bristol’s earnings per share, a move that should come in handy as patents expire and put up to a third of its revenue from drug sales at risk.Bristol currently owns 83 percent, or 170 million shares, of Mead, which makes infant formula. For every $1 of Bristol share value tendered, investors will receive $1.11 of Mead stock. Do the math, and up to 282 million Bristol shares, or 14 percent of the total, may end up removed from circulation.The discount is intended to tempt Bristol shareholders into participating. But the company would be giving away only a small part of the 84 percent gain in its Mead shares since their initial public offering in February.Assuming the exchange goes through, Bristol’s earnings per share next year should be about 4 percent higher than they would have been without the deal; that’s after the benefit of reducing the number of shares is partly offset by the loss of Mead earnings.Moreover, Bristol would save $350 million in annual dividends on its stock, more than outweighing the $136 million it currently receives on its Mead shares. Investors appreciated the potential effects of the financial engineering, bidding up Bristol’s shares by 5 percent Monday. That added more than $2 billion to the company’s market capitalization, while the much smaller Mead’s value declined by less than $500 million.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','In a reflection of the challenges many arts companies are facing, including a need to develop new audiences and balance the books, New York City Ballet on Monday announced that it was creating an executive director position to oversee all nonartistic matters and named Katherine E. Brown, chief operating officer of the public radio station WNYC, to the job.Ms. Brown, who will start her new job on Dec. 14, will oversee fund-raising, finances, marketing, media and education, responsibilities previously held by Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief. Ms. Brown will report directly to the board.The hiring of Ms. Brown, 55, is part of a new long-range plan for the company, Mr. Martins and John L. Vogelstein, the chairman of City Ballet’s board of directors, said in a joint interview with Ms. Brown.“The important thing was to have the finance, administration, marketing — all of those things — managed full time by a professional that did not report to or through Peter in order for him to focus all of his time on the artistic aspects,” Mr. Vogelstein said.Among the issues Ms. Brown must deal with is City Ballet’s budget. The company, which has a 2010 budget of about $60 million, has been operating at a deficit for the last five years. “Fortunately we have a substantial endowment, so we can afford to operate a deficit for a while,” Mr. Vogelstein said. “Obviously no organization can do that forever.”Mr. Volgelstein said he hoped Ms. Brown would help reduce expenses, increase revenue and find ways to attract a younger audience. “This takes a brand new way of thinking,” he said, adding later, “We have a lot to do, and hopefully, with Kathy here, we’ll be able to tackle this in a way we haven’t been able to up until now.”'"
"'09-11-17,'1','The New York Fed, led then by Timothy F. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary, therefore had little leverage in the negotiations, according to a post-mortem of what has emerged as the most inflammatory episode in the rescue of A.I.G.The Fed “refused to use its considerable leverage,” Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, wrote in a report to be officially released on Tuesday, examining the much-criticized decision to make A.I.G.’s trading partners whole when people and businesses were taking painful losses in the financial markets.There have been suggestions that the Fed chose to negotiate weakly, Mr. Barofsky said, to give a “backdoor bailout” to A.I.G.’s banks. He said Mr. Geithner and the Fed’s lawyers had denied this, but added that “irrespective of their stated intent,” there was no doubt about the result: “Tens of billions of dollars of government money was funneled inexorably and directly to A.I.G.’s counterparties.”Among its notable findings, the report challenged Goldman’s position that it should not have been forced to bear losses on its dealings with A.I.G. because it had successfully hedged away any exposure. Mr. Barofsky said that Goldman’s hedges were unlikely to have held up amid the market turbulence of late last year.A spokesman for Goldman took issue with that finding, saying that the bank believed it had, in fact, successfully hedged its exposure to A.I.G. up until the point in November when the Fed was seeking a way to terminate all the trading partners’ contracts with A.I.G.He said any additional exposure to A.I.G.’s losses was a moot point, because the Fed’s intervention had eliminated the risk.The report concluded that the Fed’s efforts to negotiate concessions from A.I.G.’s trading partners had no chance of success because of several crucial positions taken by the Fed.First, the Fed considered itself a creditor of A.I.G., rather than a regulator that could impose its will on banks. It approached A.I.G.’s trading partners with a request for “voluntary” concessions. Mr. Barofsky said this differed from the government’s role in the auto industry, where it lent the car makers money but also negotiated aggressively and won substantial concessions from other creditors.The Fed also decided it could not treat foreign banks differently from American banks, for fear of setting off foreign retaliation.While seeking concessions from the various banks, the Fed contacted the Commission Bancaire, a French regulator, to request support in its negotiations with two French institutions, Société Générale and Calyon.The Commission Bancaire responded “forcibly” that unless A.I.G. were in bankruptcy, the French banks were “precluded by law from making concessions and could face potential criminal liability” if they helped.By that time, seven of the eight banks had also refused to grant concessions. Officials at the Fed then met with Mr. Geithner. The officials recommended that the Fed stop seeking concessions.The report said Mr. Geithner did not recall being told one bank was willing to take a haircut, but did not challenge the account of those on his staff.The report also shed new light on the effect the rating agencies had on the way the Fed handled the A.I.G. emergency. The company’s run-on-the-bank disaster began with a major credit downgrade in September; the Fed quickly responded with an $85 billion loan.But because the Fed moved so quickly, it recycled a set of lending terms that had previously been devised for A.I.G. by lenders in the private sector. The interest rate was too high, given A.I.G.’s distress, and so the loan that was supposed to rescue the insurer ended up putting it at risk of a second credit downgrade. That, in turn, could have set off a second run-on-the-bank episode.The Fed got caught in a no-win situation, the report said. While it might have been able to win concessions by threatening to withdraw support from A.I.G., it also ran the risk that the credit agencies would take the threat too seriously and impose another catastrophic downgrade.Mr. Barofsky said the facts also undermined the Fed’s arguments that banking secrecy was an essential part of bank stability.“The default position, whenever government funds are deployed in a crisis to support markets or institutions, should be that the public is entitled to know what is being done with government funds,” he said.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','DETROIT — GMAC Financial Services, the former lending arm of General Motors, replaced its chief executive on Monday as it negotiates for another round of bailout financing from the federal government.The company’s directors appointed Michael A. Carpenter, a former Citigroup executive and current GMAC director, to succeed Alvaro de Molina, who had run the company since April 2008. Mr. Carpenter said the board believed that he would be more appropriate as chief executive than Mr. de Molina, who resigned at the board’s request.GMAC, in a statement, said it had asked the Treasury Department to postpone a decision on more aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program until the new management team had “assessed the current situation and can advise the board and Treasury regarding the appropriate amount and form of such funding.”GMAC already has received $12.5 billion from the government, which now owns almost 35 percent of the company, but was expected to ask for as much as $5.6 billion more this month. This year, the Treasury told GMAC, based on the results of stress tests to evaluate its liquidity, that it must raise $11.5 billion in capital by the end of November.GMAC, a 90-year-old auto and home lender that was converted to a bank holding company last year to qualify for bailout financing, is the only bank of the 19 subjected to the stress tests that has been unable to borrow more capital from private investors.'"

"'09-11-17,'1','Had he used the welder as a cooking appliance? “Not yet,” he said, earnestly,” but we’re going to try it out.”After all, an autoclave designed to sterilize lab equipment has proven culinarily productive — “It’s basically the pressure cooker from hell,” Dr. Myhrvold said — as has a 100-ton hydraulic press, for beef jerky.All of this high-tech kitchen tinkering feeds another of Dr. Myhrvold’s projects: a cookbook.The book, still untitled, intends to be the authoritative reference for chefs wishing to employ so-called molecular gastronomy — adapting food industry technologies to restaurant cooking.Dr. Myhrvold, who once presided over Microsoft Windows, did not undertake this endeavor as a lonely intellectual pursuit. He hired 15 people, including 5 professional chefs, a photographer, an art director and writers and editors, to create it. They included Christopher Young, a biochemistry-graduate-student-turned-chef who headed the research kitchen at the Fat Duck near London, one of the most innovative restaurants in the world.Dr. Myhrvold has long pursued a Renaissance man portfolio of interests. While still at Microsoft, he showed that sauropod dinosaurs might have been able to accelerate the tips of their tails to supersonic speeds, like cracking a whip. More recently, he has been proselytizing among paleontologists, urging them to hunt for fossilized dinosaur vomit. Owls and some other birds of prey regurgitate the bones of what they eat, and Dr. Myhrvold surmises that dinosaurs, as the ancestors of birds, might have done the same thing.Every month or so, the cookbook team gathers in a conference room to review their progress. Dr. Myhrvold scans each page, points out glitches and sketches how he wants a chart to look.“It’s basically like a software project,” Dr. Myhrvold said. “It’s very much like a review we would do at Microsoft.”The project has grown in size and scope. Originally planned as a 300-page discussion of sous vide, an increasingly popular restaurant technique of cooking food in vacuum-sealed bags in warm water baths, the book has swelled to 1,500 pages that will also cover microbiology, food safety, the physics of heat transfer on the stove and in the oven, formulas for turning fruit and vegetable juices into gels, and more.Because he is self-publishing the book, Dr. Myhrvold does not have to convince a publisher or anyone else that such a huge book aimed primarily at a narrow of audience of restaurant chefs makes economic sense. He said the book would be out in a year, although he admitted that was also what he said a year ago.“There’s not a chef on Earth who won’t learn something from this,” Dr. Myhrvold said.At least some chefs are taking interest.“I think there are parts of it that are definitely new to me,” said Wylie Dufresne, the chef and owner of WD-50 in Manhattan, who visited the kitchen laboratory. “It’s a cookbook that’s going to be in its own category.”In September, Dr. Myhrvold, Mr. Young and two of the other chefs gave a presentation at the StarChefs.com International Chefs Congress, an annual Manhattan trade show for restaurant professionals.They demonstrated how to encrust a pork loin within what was essentially a large crispy pork rind, how to make stewed prunes look like coal and how to make a “constructed cream” — breaking apart a fat and a liquid into tiny droplets and mixing them together into something that had the fluidity of heavy cream.“For example, why not make a pistachio cream where, instead of milk fat, we use pistachio oil?” Mr. Young said. “If you can get the droplets small enough, if you can coat them in proteins, you can create a dairy-free pistachio gelato that’s 100 percent pistachio oil.”They also demonstrated cryoseared duck breast, a technique that calls for implements not typically found in a kitchen: a small satchel of loose metal, dry ice, dog hair brush.“We do have to perforate it to get the fat out,” Mr. Young said. “The easiest way is a stainless steel dog hair brush. It will poke a lot of little holes that aren’t going to show up.”“For God’s sake,” Dr. Myhrvold interjected, “buy a new one for this.”The duck breast was placed skin down on the dry ice before being seared, weighed down by the satchel. The cold froze not only the skin, but also a thin layer of the meat next to the skin, which acted as a cold barrier to prevent overcooking. “Until that melts, heat won’t go above it,” Mr. Young said.The result was a crispy skin while the meat remained tender and juicy.The book presents some concepts like wet bulb temperature that will be new to cooks of all skill levels. The usual temperature set in an oven is scientifically known as the dry bulb temperature. But for cooking, the wet bulb temperature, which is essentially a measure of the evaporation rate of water and depends on the humidity, is often more important.“Nathan would make the point that food is water with a bunch of impurities in it,” Mr. Young said.Dr. Myhrvold said the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures could sometimes differ by 30 degrees, which might be the difference between a soufflé that rises and one that collapses. (One advantage of sous vide is that because the food is immersed in water, the wet and dry bulb temperatures are the same.)In another discovery of culinary heat transfer physics, Dr. Myhrvold said the bulbous shape and black color of Weber grills were wrong. To achieve an even cooking temperature across the cooking grate, the inside of the grill should be vertical and shiny to reflect the heat.That can be fixed by adding an aluminum insert to the grill. “So we have directions for that,” Dr. Myhrvold said.The conclusions have often been backed up by careful scientific exploration. For example, confit, the French technique of cooking slowly in fat, is supposed to impart a unique taste and texture as the fat penetrates the meat.But Dr. Myhrvold said: “There’s no way it could penetrate. The molecules are too big.”He said double-blind taste tests proved that the same tasty results could be achieved by steaming and then rubbing some of the fat on the outside.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.  The shuttle Atlantis vaulted into orbit on Monday and set off after the International Space Station, carrying 15 tons of spare parts and equipment as a hedge against failures after the shuttle fleet is retired next year.“We’re looking for the long-term outfitting of station,” said the shuttle commander, Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines.With Colonel Hobaugh and Capt. Barry E. Wilmore, a Navy pilot, at the controls, Atlantis’s twin solid-fuel boosters ignited with a blast of fire at 2:28 p.m., instantly pushing the winged spacecraft away from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.Wheeling about to line up on a northeasterly trajectory, Atlantis accelerated through a partly cloudy sky, on course for a docking with the space station around noon Wednesday.Joining Colonel Hobaugh and Captain Wilmore for the 11-day mission were Michael J. Foreman, a retired Navy captain; Lt. Col. Randolph J. Bresnik of the Marines; Leland D. Melvin, an expert in materials testing (and a former pro football draft pick); and Dr. Robert L. Satcher Jr., an orthopedic surgeon with a doctorate in chemical engineering.It will be the first shuttle flight for Captain Wilmore, Dr. Satcher and Colonel Bresnik, whose wife is scheduled to deliver the couple’s second child, a girl, during the mission.The primary goal of the 129th shuttle flight is to deliver critical spares to the space station that are too large to be launched on the European, Japanese and Russian cargo ships that will be used to support the outpost after the shuttle is retired next year.Mounted on twin pallets in Atlantis’s payload bay are two spare gyroscopes, used to control the space station’s orientation in space, a high-pressure oxygen tank for the lab’s airlock, and a spare pump module, ammonia coolant and nitrogen that will be needed at some point by the station’s cooling system.Other components include a spare mechanical-hand-like appendage for the station’s robot arm, a power cable spool used by the arm’s mobile transporter, a solar array battery charge-discharge unit and a device designed to prevent electrical arcing that could pose a threat to spacewalkers.The Atlantis astronauts also plan to bring a space station flight engineer, Nicole P. Stott back to Earth after three months in orbit.This will be the last shuttle mission to carry a crew member to or from the space station. Until a shuttle replacement starts flying in five to seven years, American, European, Canadian and Japanese astronauts will ride Russian Soyuz capsules to the station, paying $50 million per seat.If all goes well, the Atlantis astronauts will celebrate Thanksgiving in space and land back at the Kennedy Space Center on Nov. 27.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','“Both countries are severely repressive,” said Mr. Bennett, who is now a senior foreign affairs officer for the State Department in Baghdad. “But if Zimbabwe had Equatorial Guinea’s oil, Zimbabwean officials wouldn’t still be blocked from the U.S.”Shown the Justice Department documents that detail the accusations of corruption against Mr. Obiang, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who wrote the law restricting visas, expressed frustration and anger with the State Department, which is responsible for issuing visas.“The fact that someone like Mr. Obiang continues to travel freely here suggests strongly that the State Department is not yet applying the law as vigorously as Congress intended,” Mr. Leahy said. The law was partly inspired by the accusations of corruption surrounding Mr. Obiang’s family and the Equatorial Guinean government, Mr. Leahy’s staff said.“There are many instances of corrupt foreign officials plundering the natural resources of their countries for their own use while their people starve,” Mr. Leahy said. “The law states clearly that if you do that, you are no longer welcome in the United States.”Daniel Whitman, who retired in September as the deputy director of the Office of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in the Bureau of African Affairs at the State Department, agreed that the law should be used more forcefully. “We just seem to lack the backbone to use this prohibition,” Mr. Whitman said. “In the rare cases it is used, no one at State was willing to talk about it.”When asked how many times the laws have been used to bar corrupt foreign officials from entering the country, State Department officials declined to answer, citing privacy reasons, though Ms. Pittman said thousands of visas had been denied to corrupt officials using other legal means. A 2007 State Department report said the presidential proclamation, signed by President George W. Bush in 2004, had been used “dozens” of times.A State Department official who handles corruption investigations said that while the measures were important tools, the department as a matter of policy did not want to reveal the number of times they had been used because it would show that the number was actually quite small. The official asked not to be identified because of departmental rules barring public comment.The Justice Department memorandum, dated Sept. 4, 2007, and obtained by The New York Times, said the government believed Mr. Obiang’s assets were derived “from extortion, theft of public funds or other corrupt conduct.” From April 2005 to April 2006, the memorandum said, Mr. Obiang funneled at least $73 million into the United States, using shell corporations and offshore bank accounts to launder the money and ultimately buy his Malibu estate and a luxury jet.The document identified several wire transfers by Mr. Obiang from 2005 and 2006, beginning with a bank in Equatorial Guinea, then going to the central Banque de France and landing in American accounts at Wachovia, Bank of America and UBS. In one six-week period in 2006, Mr. Obiang transferred $33,799,799.99 to the United States, it said, which was used to buy a Gulfstream V jet.Part of his wealth, the document said, comes from a “revolutionary tax” that Mr. Obiang placed on timber. Instead of sending the payments to the treasury of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Obiang, who is considered likely to be a successor to his father, has “insisted that the payments be made directly to him,” it said.In addition, the memorandum said, the Justice Department believes that Mr. Obiang “may be receiving bribes or extortion payments” from the oil companies as a percentage of their contracts.Spokesmen for ExxonMobil and Marathon said the companies followed all relevant laws. A request for comment from Hess was not answered. The Justice Department declined to comment on the memo.Another document, prepared by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Homeland Security Department, said Mr. Obiang “routinely travels to the United States with over $1 million in cash” that he fails to declare, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Obiang regularly visits the country using a diplomatic passport, though he rarely does diplomatic business here, said the I.C.E. document. The document said the immigration agency’s goal was to deny a safe haven to Mr. Obiang and to “identify, trace, freeze and recover assets within the United States illicitly acquired through kleptocracy by Teodoro Obiang and his associates.”The documents were originally obtained by Global Witness, a British human rights group that monitors corruption in natural resources industries, after they were released in response to a legal complaint filed in France against several African dictators, including Mr. Obiang’s father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea. The Justice Department and I.C.E. would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents.Through a spokesman at Qorvis Communications, a public relations firm working for the Equatorial Guinean Embassy in Washington, Teodoro Nguema Obiang declined to be interviewed. But his brother denied the charges of corruption.“This is the problem when a country becomes very successful,” said Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima, the vice minister of mines, energy and industry and another of the president’s sons. “Everyone assumes us guilty until proven innocent.”The vice minister said his government had made great strides in dealing with corruption. He cited as an example his country’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an international coalition of governments, civil society groups and companies that sets global standards for transparency in oil, gas and mining.But a 2009 internal document from the initiative says the organization is “particularly concerned about the pace of progress” in Equatorial Guinea. The country has failed to produce a required report regarding its revenue, even though it joined the organization more than three years ago, the report says.In 2004, President Bush signed a proclamation barring entry to the United States for any foreign officials and their family members “whose misappropriation of public funds” has had serious adverse effects on American businesses or national security interests. Congress followed up in 2007 with a law containing even stronger language, barring entry to anyone “involved in corruption relating to the extraction of natural resources in their countries.”Otto Reich, who served until 2004 as the United States’ special envoy to the Western Hemisphere, said there was resistance to applying these sorts of prohibitions even before the presidential proclamation was drafted.“Senior State Department people especially from Africa kept saying that if something like this is used they wouldn’t have anyone to talk to in their home countries,” Mr. Reich said. “It’s politically simply something they do not want to take on.”The Obiang family and Equatorial Guinea have been the focus of corruption accusations for years. In 2004, a Senate panel accused Riggs Bank in Washington of having “turned a blind eye to evidence suggesting the bank was handling the proceeds of foreign corruption” in accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits from Equatorial Guinea.Committee investigators found dozens of irregular payments, multiple individual signatories to accounts and even deposits of millions of dollars in shrink-wrapped currency. Riggs Bank was fined more than $25 million for its handling of the Equatorial Guinean and other accounts, and several of the bank’s directors were criminally prosecuted.But in more recent years millions of dollars of the country’s money has found its way to other American banks, including the ones named in the Justice Department memo. Wachovia and Bank of America, according to the memo, filed suspicious activity reports to the authorities, and ultimately closed all accounts associated with Mr. Obiang and his associates, but not before tens of millions of dollars had already entered the United States.“These banks appear to have facilitated a grand corruption, and it may even have been done legally,” said Gavin Hayman, director of campaigns for Global Witness. “Those that filed suspicious activity reports may have been complying with their regulatory obligations under the law, but at the same time they went ahead and forwarded transfers of tens of millions of dollars about which they already had suspicions. Effectively, the regulations are allowing banks to earn money from corruption.”All three banks declined to answer questions about the transactions. Although Wachovia said Mr. Obiang was not a client, the Justice Department documents described how he used third parties to open accounts at some banks.Since oil was discovered there in 1996, Equatorial Guinea has become the third-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria and Angola, with estimated revenues of $4.8 billion in 2007. But although petroleum has made the ruling Obiang family and its associates vastly rich, the oil and gas wealth has not been spread beyond ruling elites.In 2006, more than three-quarters of the population was living below the poverty line, according to a 2009 International Monetary Fund report.By some measures, conditions in the country are getting worse. Though the nation’s gross domestic product grew more than tenfold from 1990 to 2007, infant mortality rose to 12 percent from 10 percent, according to a 2009 Unicef report.'"
"'09-11-17,'1','It was another in a line of bright economic reports. Last week, European officials said the economy of the 16-country euro zone had grown for the first time in six quarters.The dollar rebounded slightly after Mr. Bernanke’s remarks, but ended the day lower against other major world currencies. Gold closed at $1,138.60 an ounce, and oil settled at $78.90, up from $76.35 on Friday.At the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 136.49 points, or 1.33 percent, to 10,406.96.The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 15.82 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,109.30 — finishing above 1,100 for the first time in more than a year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq rose 29.97 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,197.85.The Dow, which rose 2.5 percent last week after rising 3.2 percent the previous week, has gained 17 percent this year. The S.& P. 500-share index climbed 2.3 percent last week, while the Nasdaq added 2.6 percent.The gains were across the board, led by materials and energy shares as well as industrial stocks. Shares in Exxon Mobil rose 2.7 percent, Occidental Petroleum rose 2.46 percent and ConocoPhillips rose 1.91 percent as oil prices increased.Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said the day’s gains could be explained by a recurring cycle on Wall Street since March: a weak dollar sending high-yield stocks and commodities upward.“It’s like ‘Groundhog Day’ every day,” he said. “People are playing the game.”Jeffrey D. Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, said a factor leading to Monday’s upturn was a desire by fund managers to end the year with strong performance. “These guys not only have performance anxiety, they’re also going to have bonus anxiety, and they are ultimately going to have job anxiety,” Mr. Saut said.A report on retail sales in the United States also helped buoy shares. The Commerce Department said Monday that retail sales increased 1.4 percent in October, topping the 0.8 percent jump that economists had forecast. The government revised its figures for September, saying sales fell by 2.3 percent rather than its original estimate of 1.5 percent.“Anything even vaguely positive as it relates to the consumer right now is going to be viewed as a big upside,” said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets. “That is what the market is most focused on at the moment.”But Bruce A. Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company, said the report was not totally optimistic, since much of the growth came from car sales.“Expectations are low for the consumer going forward, and for the holiday season,” he said. “The retail sales report did not do a lot to relieve that. But if the consumer is going to be saving more, rather than maintaining a borrow-and-spend attitude, it is very bullish for the market long term.”Mr. Saut of Raymond James said strong earnings reports from retailers this week were also pushing stocks up. The home improvement retailer Lowe’s, for example, said Monday that while its profit declined 30 percent in the third quarter, its results had matched expectations. The company also said it was seeing signs that the housing market was stabilizing.“All of this is pretty consistent with a moderate economic recovery,” Mr. Saut said. “You don’t need spectacular growth for stocks to do well. All you need is some growth.”The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 23/32, to 100 11/32. The yield fell to 3.33 percent, from 3.42 percent late Friday.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:'"
"'09-11-17,'1','Many strokes cannot be explained by known risk factors like high blood pressure and smoking, and scientists have speculated that infection could play a role.A new study is linking cumulative exposure to five common pathogens with an increased risk for stroke. The infections in order of significance are Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, according to the study, published online on Nov. 9 in The Archives of Neurology. “Each of these common pathogens may persist after an acute infection and contribute to perpetuating a state of chronic low-level infection,” said the paper’s lead author, Dr. Mitchell S. V. Elkind, an associate professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center.Dr. Elkind said the low-level infection and inflammation in the vessel walls might be leading to disease.The researchers followed an ethnically diverse group of 1,625 residents from northern Manhattan whose average age was 68 and who had been stroke-free at the beginning of the study. After almost 8 years, 67 of the participants had suffered strokes.Dr. Elkind noted that the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between common infections and stroke, only an association, and that the evidence was circumstantial.'"

"'09-11-18,'1','THE luxury goods industry, struggling through a recession that has threatened some well-known names with extinction, is trying to use technology to its advantage.Many in the fashion business remain wary of the Internet, partly because of continuing legal battles over online sales of counterfeit goods and concerns about diluting carefully honed brand images. Many companies also have failed to execute online storefronts successfully. But executives say that attitudes are softening as brands realize that the Web provides one of the last untapped sources of potential growth.Federico Marchetti, the founder of Yoox, a company in Milan that runs retailing sites for luxury brands like Valentino, Emilio Pucci and Jil Sander, said many labels were skeptical not long ago.“Now,” he said, “it is the opposite.”The move to capitalize on the Web has become a financial imperative. Analysts at Bain & Company estimate that the sales of luxury goods will fall to 154 billion euros this year ($229 billion), from 170 billion euros in 2008. It is unlikely that online revenue — still only a tiny fraction of the total — will make up the difference soon.One of the most successful ventures on the Web has been Net-à-Porter, a site based in London that sells high-end fashion and accessories, delivering them to homes or offices in black boxes. Though sales in the United States slowed during the depth of the recession, they have since recovered and have continued to rise at double-digit rates in other markets, the company said. It expects sales this year to top £100 million ($168 million), up from £82 million last year.“It just made a lot of sense to allow women to shop when they wanted to shop, how they wanted to shop — at work, at home, in bedroom,” said Natalie Massenet, the company’s founder.'"

"'09-11-18,'1','A California utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, has accused more than a dozen banks of rigging the sales of municipal derivatives and sharing illegal profits.In a lawsuit based on federal and state antitrust claims, the utility claims that the financial firms, including Bank of America, UBS and JPMorgan Chase & Company, conspired to pre-select winners of municipal derivative auctions, coordinated their pricing and accepted kickbacks disguised as fees from co-conspirators.The accusations are similar to those made by a federal grand jury last month in New York, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Nov. 12 in federal court in Sacramento. In that case, the founder of CDR Financial Products, David R. Rubin, and two employees were indicted and charged with accepting kickbacks on investments sold to local governments. CDR, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is also named as a defendant in the Sacramento case.The banks engaged in “allocating customers and markets for municipal derivatives, rigging the bidding process by which municipal bond issuers acquire municipal derivatives and conspiring to manipulate the terms that issuers received,” according to the suit.Derivatives are unregulated financial instruments linked to stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific events like changes in interest rates or weather.Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, adding that the bank was cooperating with federal investigations of the derivatives industry.'"
"'09-11-18,'1','Offsets have played a growing role in the greening of travel because carbon dioxide emissions from airplanes are growing so quickly and there is currently no technological fix that would drastically lower them.In the , dozens of hotels and airlines have embraced such programs in the last year or two. became the latest American airline to offer one this summer. Globally, offset programs have grown into a multimillion-dollar industry.But it has proved difficult to monitor or quantify the emissions-reducing potential of the thousands of green projects financed by customers’ payments, and there are no industrywide standards.Responsible Travel is not the only organization that has changed its mind about the usefulness of offsets: Yahoo and the United States House of Representatives both ended trial offset-purchase programs this year, concluding that the money was better spent on improving their buildings’ energy efficiency.Some of the world’s leading experts on the emissions issue have reviewed and rejected purchasing offsets for air travel.“We’re always looking at it, but so far I’ve decided not to do it,” said Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a vast nonprofit consortium of companies that have pledged to report and reduce their emissions. For one thing, he said, offsetting the emissions of a flight from to New York would probably require an extra fee of $200 to $300, far above what any airline is now charging.And some experts say that emissions from airline travel are simply so large that it may be impossible to offset them.“Buying offsets is a nice idea, just like giving money to a soup kitchen is a nice idea, but that doesn’t end world hunger,” said Anja Kollmuss, a staff scientist for the Stockholm Environment Institute who is based at a branch at .“Buying offsets won’t solve the problem because flying around the way we do is simply unsustainable,” said Ms. Kollmuss, who has researched airline offsets.A recent study in concluded that one flight from London to produced more carbon dioxide per person than the average British commuter produces in a year by traveling by train, subway or car.Airlines defend offsets, even while acknowledging that some projects have not lived up to their promises. For example, mango trees that were planted in to offset a concert tour by the band Coldplay were found to have died a few years later.EasyJet, one of ’s largest low-cost airlines, did not offer offsets until 2007 — late for a European carrier — because it was trying to figure out how to ensure the money went to the right places, said Oliver Aust, a spokesman.It now gives passengers the option of offsetting their flight emissions by investing directly in projects that have been approved by a certification program for reducing emissions.EasyJet, which was founded in 1995 but has vastly expanded its fleet since 2003, also uses only the newest and most jets, flies full planes and packs in extra rows of seats, making its estimated emissions per passenger 28 percent lower than more established carriers on the same routes. Some airlines are experimenting with innovations that may someday reduce emissions, like using fuels made with algae rather than crude .Passenger offsets purport to cancel out carbon dioxide emissions ton for ton through in green projects. But critics say there is no transparency about how companies measure whether that happens.For example, many airlines offer investments in tree-planting projects because trees absorb carbon dioxide. But experts say it takes decades for trees to start fully absorbing the gas, making them a questionable offset for airplanes, which emit carbon dioxide. Ms. Kollmuss said the quality of offsets depended on the project. “But if it’s very cheap, it does raise red flags,” she said.For Mr. Francis of Responsible Travel, the final straw came when he noticed that carbon offsets were being offered by private jet companies and helicopter tour operators, which generate very high emissions per passenger. “The message was, ‘Don’t worry, you can offset the emissions,’ ” he said. “But you don’t really need to see from the air, do you? And you can travel in a commercial airliner.”Mr. Francis said he was not advocating an end to flying — Responsible Travel offers tours to , the Galapagos Islands and , among other far-flung destinations — but simply more reflection on the environmental impact of such journeys.Responsible Travel had bought its offsets through one of the best-known offset companies, ClimateCare, which was purchased last year by .While acknowledging that improved, universal standards for personal airline offsets are needed, Richard Folland, a and energy adviser to JP Morgan, said the offset concept had played an important role in helping to direct money to otherwise unaffordable environmental projects in poorer countries.“The primary goal is to reduce emissions, but offsets are helpful” in managing the costs, he said, adding, “There has to be a balance struck.”Mr. Dickinson of the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project said that rather than buying offsets he had sharply scaled back on flying and was instead taking trains or conducting meetings by phone or teleconference. He said that if he owned an airline, he would now be diversifying into other modes of transport.Referring to the recent purchase of a railroad by the investor , he said, “What does it tell you that the world’s most successful investor is investing in trains?”'"
"'09-11-18,'1','The time could come in handy, because figuring out how to enforce the grace period is a work in progress. It was unclear, for example, whether the Muni Meters that control multiple parking spaces would be reprogrammed to account for the extra time or if traffic agents would keep track of the time as they already do, through the clocks in their electronic ticket-writing devices.Mr. Bloomberg warned that the bill would create chaos, with drivers and traffic agents arguing over whose watch was more accurate. But the bill’s sponsor, Councilman Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, said there should be no confusion because there would be no change in how traffic agents enforced the rules.“They’re issuing tickets now and no one is confused about the time, right?” Mr. Felder said. “If they say it’s 9:01 and a taxpayer says it’s 8:59, the taxpayer is still getting the ticket, so whatever you do now you’ll continue doing.”But he conceded that the bill did not really spell out specific instructions. Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, which oversees traffic enforcement, could not shed any more light, saying in an e-mail message, “We’ll wait for the final outcome on the bill before commenting further.”Other cities have implemented similar grace periods for expired meters, though none have rules requiring drivers to move their cars so that streets can be cleaned, which happens in most New York neighborhoods at least once a week, for up to three hours.White Plains and Miami have had grace periods for years, and Laguna Beach, Calif., implemented one six weeks ago, all for the same reason: Too many drivers felt they were being victimized by overzealous traffic agents.“We had received many complaints about parking enforcement officers hiding behind the bushes, waiting for the meter to run out,” said Albert T. Moroni, the parking commissioner in White Plains, which has a five-minute grace. “In order to show people that we’re not trying to be punitive, we decided to offer this as a sign of our good intentions.”White Plains traffic agents know when the grace period ends because single-space meters scroll backward to six minutes before expiring. Angel Diaz of the Miami Parking Authority said officers were told to wait 10 minutes before ticketing for an expired meter.That was the case in New York before responsibility for traffic enforcement shifted from the Transportation Department to the police in 1996, said James Huntley, president of Communications Workers of America Local 1182, which represents the uniformed traffic and sanitation enforcement agents.“We were to be told at roll call to wait five minutes before writing somebody up,” he said. “But the Police Department tells us to issue a summons at whatever time it is that the street cleaning is starting, and that’s what we do.”On Tuesday, one traffic agent had already adopted her own grace period after hearing of the Council’s vote. As she ticketed a sport utility vehicle in a no-parking zone on Avenue C, she said that during her rounds in the neighborhood, where alternate-side regulations were in effect from 9 to 10:30 a.m., she waited until 10 to start checking.A grace period “will make people more happy,” said the agent, who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to speak with a reporter. “It will make my job easier.”'"
"'09-11-18,'1','Josh Tyrangiel, a longtime Time magazine editor and reporter, has been appointed the editor of BusinessWeek, its new owner, Bloomberg L.P., announced on Tuesday morning.Mr. Tyrangiel, 37, is currently a deputy managing editor of Time, where his duties include overseeing its Web site. His background is not in business journalism but cultural coverage: he worked for Vibe and Rolling Stone before Time, where he was a music critic and London correspondent before becoming an editor.“Look, I’ve edited plenty of business stories — there are sectors that I know quite well, including technology — but I wasn’t hired to be the great business editor. There are tons of editors at BusinessWeek and tons of editors at Bloomberg,” Mr. Tyrangiel said in an interview. The important thing, he said, is for BusinessWeek to beat competitors “by being better, faster, smarter, more comprehensive.”Bloomberg wants to use the magazine, which it expects to rename Bloomberg BusinessWeek, to write directly for consumers, rather than just subscribers to its financial terminals. It is also aiming at readership among, and interviews with, government officials and chief executives.There is a growing Time Inc. presence at the new magazine. Norman Pearlstine, Bloomberg’s chief content officer and the former editor in chief of Time Inc., is overseeing the acquisition of BusinessWeek. Jim Kelly, the former editor of Time and Mr. Tyrangiel’s onetime boss, has been advising Mr. Pearlstine on it.Mr. Tyrangiel said that he was drawing up his editorial plans for the magazine and the BusinessWeek.com Web site. He added that he would be talking to BusinessWeek employees as his Dec. 3 start date approached to get their thoughts on how the magazine should change. Bloomberg is expected to decide by Dec. 1 which staff members it will keep.'"
"'09-11-18,'1','The treasure hunters at the Actors Company Theater have unearthed another jewel with “The Late Christopher Bean,” a comedy seldom seen in New York since its Broadway premiere in 1932. It’s a play that has remained fresh and funny, proving once again that a strong script is rarely tarnished by time.“Bean” is set outside Boston in the Haggett household, where worries over money are persistent. Visitors soon arrive from New York, seeking paintings by Christopher Bean, a boarder who once lived with the Haggetts and died 10 years earlier. Bean has recently been decreed “not merely the greatest American painter, but one of the great masters of all times.”Prices for his works have skyrocketed, and paintings the Haggetts may or may not own could make them rich. In a twisty plot that is wholly charming, almost everyone is soon scheming to profit.Along with its commendable mission to restage forgotten plays, the Actors Company has put an impressive amount of work into its production. The set, by Charlie Corcoran, shows a sharp eye for detail, as do Martha Hally’s costumes and Ben Stanton’s lighting.The cast of nine is often as skilled. Though the actors’ timing occasionally misfires — a number of the jokes elicit wide smiles rather than the big laughs that such writing deserves — the ensemble, directed by Jenn Thompson, is nevertheless engaging. James Murtaugh as Dr. Haggett and Jessiee Datino as his daughter Susan are particularly effective.While “Bean” has some quaint features of the period — telegrams arrive and are read aloud; young lovers gaze at each other longingly — such moments hardly feel stuffy. And with all its talk of greed, a weak economy and a fickle art market, the topics could have come from this morning’s newspaper. Written by Sidney Howard (who would later win an Oscar for his screenplay for “Gone With the Wind”) and based on a French comedy, “The Late Christopher Bean” is a happy rediscovery. It’s a play that passes the test of time with the highest of marks.'"
"'09-11-18,'1','Baroque music and Gypsy tunes may seem unlikely bedfellows on a program, but Matthias Maute, artistic director of the period-instrument Ensemble Caprice, argues that Bach and Telemann may have been influenced by itinerant musicians.In a concert called “Bach and the Bohemian Gypsies” at the Miller Theater on Saturday evening (part of the series Bach and the Baroque), the excellent Ensemble Caprice, founded in Germany in 1989 and now based in Montreal, offered selections from the Uhrovska Collection of 1730. This compilation, rediscovered in the mid-20th century, includes almost 350 violin melodies from Eastern Europe.Bach, writes Mr. Maute in the program notes, walked great distances through northeastern Germany as a young man and might have been exposed to Gypsy music. Telemann’s encounters with the genre are better documented: he wrote of his appreciation of the “barbaric beauty” of Gypsy music in what is now Poland.Musicologists might debate the connections, but the music making on Saturday was first rate in the group’s striking arrangements of selections from the Uhrovska Collection. The violinist Olivier Brault offered virtuosic solos, performing with soulful, improvisatory flair.Bach was represented by his Concerto in F (BWV 1057), with fine playing from the harpsichordist Kenneth Weiss, and an arrangement of the Italian Concerto by Mr. Maute, who played the recorder with panache. The program also featured Telemann’s Concerto in E minor for recorder and flute, with its Gypsy-like finale, and several Bach polonaises.'"
"'09-11-18,'1','“I do not expect, and I can speak authoritatively for the president on this, that we thought the waters would part and everything would change over the course of our almost two-and-a-half-day trip to China,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. “We understand there’s a lot of work to do and that we’ll continue to work hard at making more progress.”Several China experts noted that Mr. Obama was not leaving Beijing empty-handed. The two countries put out a five-point joint statement pledging to work together on a variety of issues. The statement calls for regular exchanges between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu, and asks that each side pay more attention to the strategic concerns of the other. The statement also pledges that they will work as partners on economic issues, Iran and climate change.But despite a conciliatory tone that began weeks ago when Mr. Obama declined to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, before visiting China to avoid offending China’s leaders, it remains unclear whether Mr. Obama made progress on the most pressing policy matters on the American agenda in China or elsewhere in Asia.The president has had to fend off criticism from American conservatives that he appeared to soften the American stance on the positioning of troops on the Japanese island of Okinawa, and for bowing to Japan’s emperor.At a regional conference in Singapore, Mr. Obama announced a setback on another top foreign policy priority, climate change, acknowledging that comprehensive agreement to fight global warming was no longer within reach this year.Past American presidents have usually insisted in advance on some concrete achievements from their trips overseas. President Bush received vigorous endorsements of his top foreign policy priority, the global war on terrorism, during his visits to Beijing, and President Bill Clinton guided China toward joining the World Trade Organization after prolonged negotiations. When either of those presidents visited the country, China often made a modest concession on human rights as well.This time, Mr. Hu declined to follow the lead of President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who, after months of massaging by the Obama administration, now says that he is open to tougher sanctions against Iran if negotiations fail to curb Iran’s nuclear program. The administration needs China’s support if tougher sanctions are to be approved by the United Nations Security Council. But during the joint appearance in Beijing on Tuesday, Mr. Hu made no mention of sanctions.Rather, he said, it was “very important” to “appropriately resolve the Iranian nuclear regime through dialogue and negotiations.” And then, as if to drive home that point, Mr. Hu added, “During the talks, I underlined to President Obama that given our differences in national conditions, it is only normal that our two sides may disagree on some issues.”White House officials acknowledged that they did not get what they wanted from Mr. Hu on Iran but said that Mr. Obama’s method would yield more in the long term. “We’re not looking for them to lead or change course, we’re looking for them to not be obstructionist,” one administration official said.In a meeting in Beijing with a senior Chinese official on Wednesday morning, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton again pressed China on Iran. She told the official, Dai Bingguo, that even if China had not decided what sanctions on Iran it would accept, “you need to send a signal,” said a senior American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could describe the exchange.Mr. Obama did not appear to move the Chinese on currency issues, either. China has come under heavy pressure, not only from the United States but also from Europe and several Asian countries, to revise its policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi, pegged at an artificially low value against the dollar to help promote its exports. Some economists say China must take that step to prevent the return of large trade and financial imbalances that may have contributed to the recent financial crisis.Mr. Obama on Tuesday could only cite China’s “past statements” in support of shifting toward market-oriented exchange rates, implying that he had not extracted a fresh commitment from Beijing to move in that direction soon.There are many reasons the White House may have heeded China’s clear desire for a visit free of the polemics that often accompany meetings between leaders of the two countries. Mr. Obama’s foreign policy is rooted in recasting the United States as a thoughtful listener to friends and rivals alike. “No we haven’t made China a democracy in three days — maybe if we pounded our chest a lot that would work,” Mr. Gibbs said in an e-mail message on Tuesday night. “But it hasn’t in the last 16 years.”Kenneth Lieberthal, a Brookings Institution scholar who oversaw China issues in President Clinton’s White House, agreed. “The United States actually has enormous influence on popular thinking in China, but it is primarily by example,” he said. “If you go to the next step and say, ‘You guys ought to be like us,’ you lose the impact of who you are.”The National Security Council’s spokesman, Michael A. Hammer, added, “What we did come to do is speak bluntly about the issues which are important to us, not in an unnecessarily offensive manner, but rather in the Obama style of showing respect.”Mr. Obama, even as he projected a softer image, did nudge the Chinese on some delicate issues.On Tuesday, standing next to Mr. Hu, Mr. Obama brought up Tibet, where Beijing-backed authorities have clamped down on religious freedom. “While we recognize that Tibet is part of the People’s Republic of China, the United States supports the early resumption of dialogue between the Chinese government and representatives of the Dalai Lama to resolve any concerns and differences that the two sides may have,” he said.'"
"'09-11-18,'1','Wholesale prices in the United States increased only slightly in October, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing concerns that inflation might soon emerge as a threat to the economic recovery in a period of extraordinarily low interest rates.A separate report on industrial production showed weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, which is grappling with tepid consumer demand. The stock markets, meanwhile, rose slightly. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, and trading volume remained light.David M. Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said investors took the mixed signals on the economic data in stride.“It’s a two-steps-forward, one-step-back type of environment,” he said. “Many people have worried inflation will snap back with a vengeance, but there still seems to be so much global overcapacity that in the short term we can focus on the play at hand.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.The Labor Department’s wholesale prices report said that higher food and energy costs contributed to a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent rise in the producer price index, which measures the cost of goods to companies. That fell short of the 0.5 percent jump economists had forecast.'"

"'09-11-19,'0','Don’t hate them because they’re beautiful. Don’t hate them because they’re thin and young and glowing with health. Don’t hate them because they live in a fabulous New York loft and have jobs that seem to give their lives meaning and, in one case, will soon make them wealthy. And especially don’t hate them because they have a little girl and — because Mommy wants to work as hard and as much as Daddy does — they employ a live-in nanny. Well, go ahead and hate them a little because they have a nanny. In fact, hate them a lot.The parents in question are Ellen (Michelle Williams) and Leo (Gael García Bernal), who, when we first see them in “Mammoth,” are engaged in a giddy group tickle with their 8-year-old, Jackie (Sophie Nyweide). It’s a snapshot of family bliss (the three are as prettily arranged as the bourgeois bohemian furnishings), one that the Swedish director Lukas Moodysson will before long and with great deliberation begin ripping to shreds. First, though, he sets the stage, pulling you in with seemingly casual details and actions — a business trip, a vigorous run, a visit to a planetarium — which don’t seem meaningful in and of themselves.But because Mr. Moodysson is a director of some talent (his best film remains “Show Me Love”), and uses details and actions to advance his story, nothing in this overdetermined tale is casual: Leo, as it happens, is jetting off to Thailand on a private plane, and Ellen takes her run on a treadmill perched on the family’s apparently private roof, the city spilling around her. Meanwhile, down in the streets, far from her highflying parents, Jackie takes her nanny’s hand. A woman who — because Mr. Moodysson doesn’t want anyone to miss the point, however obvious — is named Gloria (Marife Necesito), as in “Gloria in Excelsis Deo” or “Glory to God in the Highest,” said to have been sung by angels as they announced the birth of Jesus.Gloria’s own cherubs, Salvador (Jan Nicdao) and Manuel (Martin Delos Santos), live with her brother (Perry Dizon) and mother (Maria Del Carmen) in a nice if cramped home in the Philippines. The children miss their mother, who works abroad to pay for their schooling and a home of their own that, at this stage in Gloria’s struggle, is nothing but cinderblock walls and a still-elusive dream. Gloria regularly talks to her children, whose photos decorate her small room in the big loft, cooing endearments into her cellphone. The boys understandably miss her — please, please come home, they plead — but Gloria must make money, which is why she feeds, dresses and tenderly cuddles someone else’s child instead of her own.The plight of mothers forced to neglect their children so they can support them is familiar and depressing and as old as the world, or rather human civilization. Most filmmakers working in fiction tend to ignore this kind of struggle unless they can use it for melodrama or tragedy, as Mr. Moodysson does to increasingly blunt effect by fingering his villains and hanging halos on his martyrs. It emerges that Leo and Ellen have blood, or at least blame, on their hands. Their privilege marks them as exploiters, however casual and naïve, never more overtly — or comically — than when Ellen apologizes to Gloria for a jealous outburst (over Jackie), a self-serving act of conscience that Ellen delivers while Gloria scrubs the family’s toilet.In “Mammoth,” when a rich child eats her lunch in New York, a poor boy in the Philippines cries. And so it goes, as privilege begets exploitation with grimly deterministic logic and pages and pages of bad dialogue (this is Mr. Moodysson’s first film in English), much of it spoken by Ms. Williams, fine, if floundering in an impossible role. Mr. García Bernal, whose character receives a ludicrously expensive pen made with woolly mammoth ivory (hence the title), has a somewhat easier time, partly because when he engages with another embodiment of first world exploitation (Run Srinikornchot), she isn’t holding a toilet brush. But no worries: Mr. Moodysson has never met a pleasure he didn’t want to punish. Leo ends up feeling really bad.Written and directed by Lukas Moodysson; director of photography, Marcel Zyskind; edited by Michal Leszczylowski; music by Jesper Kurlandsky, Erik Holmquist and Linus Gierta; production designer, Josefin Asberg; produced by Lars Jonsson; released by IFC Films.

"'09-11-19,'0','Perhaps the most moving moment of the night came with the presentation of the award for Young People’s Literature, which went to Phillip Hoose for “Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice,” a biography of Ms. Colvin, who as an African-American teenager in 1950s Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up her seat on a bus nine months before Rosa Parks took the same stand.Mr. Hoose brought Ms. Colvin onto the stage to accept the award. “My job was to pull someone who was about to disappear under history’s rug,” he said. The book was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.The awards, in their 60th year, were presented at a black-tie dinner at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan. About 640 attendees, down slightly from a year earlier, paid up to $12,000 per table.The writer and comedic actor Andy Borowitz hosted the ceremonies, joking that just as he had been invited to perform services for no pay, publishing was similarly an industry that demanded “a lot of work, and then nothing.”The award for poetry went to Keith Waldrop for “Transcendental Studies: A Trilogy,” published by University of California Press.This year’s nominees had some in the publishing industry wondering about the relevance of the National Book Awards, in part because most of the titles had sold so little and few people had heard of them. The biggest selling finalist was Mr. McCann, with “Let the Great World Spin” selling 19,000 copies in hardcover, according to Nielsen Bookscan, which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales.The award can sometimes fuel sales, but in other cases its effects are modest. Generally, readers seem to pay more attention the Pulitzer Prize, or even Britain’s Man Booker Prize. This year’s winner, Hilary Mantel’s “Wolf Hall,” has sold 45,000 copies.The novelist Dave Eggers received the 2009 Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. Mr. Eggers, the founder of the independent publishing house McSweeney’s who also helped found 826 National, a nonprofit writing center for young people, said in his acceptance speech that he remained “an eternal optimist” about publishing.“I think this is the most exciting and democratic time,” he said. “There is a pluralism in publishing that is unprecedented.”The award for the Distinguished Contribution to American Letters was given to Gore Vidal, the novelist and social critic.In wandering remarks, Mr. Vidal cited anecdotes about President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. In his only comments about publishing, he puzzled the audience by noting, “Nowadays it seems the progress of literature is to first print the book and then pulp it,” adding: “It saves such a lot of time. It’s fun for everybody.”'"
"'09-11-19,'0','Few universities make required reports to the government about the financial conflicts of their researchers, and even when such conflicts are reported, university administrators rarely require those researchers to eliminate or reduce these conflicts, government investigators found.In a report expected to be made public on Thursday, Daniel R. Levinson, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, said 90 percent of universities relied solely on the researchers themselves to decide whether the money they made in consulting and other relationships with drug and device makers was relevant to their government-financed research.And half of universities do not ask their faculty members to disclose the amount of money or stock they make from drug and device makers, so the potential for extensive conflicts with their government-financed research is often known only to the researchers themselves, the report concluded.The report is the latest in a series of investigations that have found that conflicts of interest in academic research are at best lightly supervised. Federal rules require that researchers report to their universities any outside income that may conflict with government-financed research, much of which comes from the National Institutes of Health. Those rules also require universities to manage those conflicts in ways that protect patients and the integrity of research.But a long-running investigation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has found that the enforcement of these rules is based on an honor system that is often violated.'"

"'09-11-19,'0','Separately, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat who has led efforts in the Senate to seek more concessions from drug makers, wrote to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services asking for “an immediate and thorough investigation into drug industry pricing and recent increases, and the extent to which these increases may affect the Medicare and Medicaid programs.”Both letters cited a New York Times article on Monday reporting that wholesale prices of brand-name drugs rose about 9 percent in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the highest increase in years — even as the Consumer Price Index was declining during the same 12-month period.The Times article cited a Wall Street analyst’s calculations; a study sponsored by the AARP, the advocacy group for older Americans; and a report by IMS Health, a consulting firm to the drug industry.The price increases could add more than $10 billion to the nation’s drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year.At that rate, the increases would more than offset at least the first year of savings that the drug industry has agreed to make under a provision of the health care bill that was approved by the Senate Finance Committee and has been incorporated into the full Senate bill introduced on Wednesday. That measure calls for the industry to come up with discounts and rebates that would save Medicare recipients and the government $8 billion a year for 10 years.“I want to know if there’s a back-door move under way by the drug makers to recover some of the concessions they’ve promised for health care reform,” Senator Nelson said in a statement Wednesday.Drug companies do not deny having raised wholesale prices at the highest rate in years. But they say it has nothing to do with the impending health care legislation. They say the price increases are necessary to maintain profits for research and employment in the face of a difficult business environment, which includes a slowdown in sales of many brand-name products, expiring patents and increasing competition from generic drugs.The wholesale prices of brand-name drugs most commonly used by Medicare recipients rose in the latest 12-month period at the fastest rate since at least 1992, according to Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pricing expert working with AARP.Separately, a study by the investment bank Credit Suisse found that prices for all drugs from the eight largest United States pharmaceutical companies had risen, on average, at the highest rate in at least five years.And IMS Health said there were higher-than-expected price increases this year.Mr. Schondelmeyer, professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota, and Catherine J. Arnold, a senior drug industry analyst for Credit Suisse, have said they believe that part of the reason for the price increases was to get ahead of possible cost containment measures in health care reform.Professor Schondelmeyer and Joseph P. Newhouse, a Harvard health economist, said there were precedents for drug price increases before government actions affecting the industry.The House Democrats also said the G.A.O. had previously found unusual price increases in some prescription drugs in the year before Congress added drug benefits to Medicare.The House letter on Wednesday said that the G.A.O. could build on that work.The House members are also asking the G.A.O. to submit a proposal to continuously monitor prescription drug prices. The House health care bill already includes a provision authorizing Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers — a proposal hotly opposed by the industry.Ken Johnson, an official with the drug industry’s trade association, said in a statement that calls for an investigation were “based on misleading use of statistics and sensationalized media reports.”Mr. Johnson, senior vice president for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Research Association, did not deny any of the specific findings of AARP, Credit Suisse and IMS Health reports, which were based on data supplied by manufacturers and wholesalers. But he said other measurements of drug price increases show they have risen substantially less than 9 percent.Mr. Johnson accused AARP of “trying to muddy the waters for its own political gain as we enter the homestretch of the health care reform debate.”An AARP executive vice president, John Rother, said in a statement: “This isn’t about politics. It’s about affordable health care.”'"
"'09-11-19,'0','The association now has 40 franchises that form leagues and hold local tournaments in 30 states. It also sponsors regional championships and a five-day national championship featuring singles, doubles and team competitions. It has about 10,000 members, 114 of them professional players.“It’s a major national organization, a growing business,” Jay Tomlinson, the editor and publisher of Bull’s-Eye News, a bimonthly magazine, said in an interview last week. “There have been several big national promoters, and Glenn was one of them.”Mr. Remick helped popularize the game in other ways.“He started the soft-tip dart program,” Jim Poliquin, the founder of the Hall of Fame, said last week. “That made it possible to move the tournaments out of the bars into places like a hotel ballroom.”As opposed to the all-stainless-steel dart, the soft-tip model has a plastic tip that allows it to pierce the board, hit a sensor and electronically register the value of the part of the pie-shaped wedge that the player’s dart has pierced. The score is then immediately displayed on a large scoreboard. A steel dart would short-circuit the sensor.“It’s really helped the game considerably,” Mr. Poliquin said, “and he was one of the key ones to start tournaments in that category.”Besides allowing for bigger audiences, there were other advantages to the competitions that Mr. Remick, and others, began holding in large hotels.“Tournaments usually start Friday night and end about 5 o’clock Sunday morning,” Mr. Poliquin said. “Golf guys have caddies; dart players have to walk eight feet after every throw, then walk back, and that can be miles in the course of a day. Having it in a hotel, you can check into your room; you’re there.“And if you play in a pub,” he continued, “you almost have to have a shuttle bus to take us to and from the site, because you don’t want us driving and drinking.”His promotional skills aside, Mr. Remick was also an accomplished darter. In 1985, he was captain of the American team that took second place at an international tournament in Brisbane, Australia.Glenn Wellington Remick was born on Jan. 21, 1951, in St. Johnsbury, Vt., one of five children of Glenn and Shirley Remick. His father was a car service manager. Both his parents were darters.When young Glenn was in seventh grade, the family moved to Greenfield, Mass. After graduating from high school, he attended Greenfield Community College, but dropped out to work as a welder at construction sites all over western Massachusetts.“He would carry his darts with him, and as soon as he got off work he would head down to one of the local bars,” Karl Remick said. “He would be throwing darts and watching baseball on TV, and wondering why darting couldn’t be a professional sport.”With his wife, the former Gloria Denault, Mr. Remick opened the dart shop in Holyoke. Besides his wife and his son Karl, he is survived by his father; another son, Mark; a daughter, Sarah Coyne; a sister, Glennise Remick; and a brother, Erik.Although he was a major promoter of the game, Mr. Remick did not shun smaller venues, like the one at the V.F.W. hall or the board by the snack stand at the local bowling alley. He also threw darts in his garage, pausing to sip the beer he made in his home brewery.'"
"'09-11-19,'0','The reports, known as material loss reviews, delve into the past, but their significance lies in how they might shape the future. As another wave of bank failures looms, policy makers are considering a variety of measures that would generally strengthen banks’ finances and limit their ability to lend money aggressively in risky areas like construction. Bankers contend that such steps would not only hurt their businesses but also the broader economy, because they would throttle the flow of credit just as growth is resuming.But while the worst seems to be over for the banking industry as a whole, many lenders are still in danger. The havoc caused by the collapse of the housing market is now being exacerbated by the deepening problems in commercial real estate, which many analysts see as the next flashpoint for the industry.Given the past lapses, some wonder whether examiners will spot new troubles in time. Of the nation’s 8,100 banks, about 2,200 — ranging from community lenders in the Rust Belt to midsize regional players — far exceed the risk thresholds that would ordinarily call for greater scrutiny from management and regulators, according to Foresight Analytics, a banking research firm.About 600 small banks are in danger of collapsing because of troubled real estate loans if they do not shore up their finances soon, according to the firm. About 150 lenders have failed since the crisis erupted in mid-2007.Many bank examiners acknowledge they were lulled into believing the good times for banks would last. They also concede that they were sometimes reluctant to act when troubles surfaced, for fear of unsettling the housing market and the economy.Then as now, banking lobbyists vigorously opposed attempts to rein in the banks, like the 2006 guidelines that discouraged banks from holding big commercial real estate positions.“Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” said Timothy W. Long, the chief bank examiner for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. “At the height of the economic boom, to take an aggressive supervisory approach and tell people to stop lending is hard to do.”Haven Trust, founded in 2000, enjoyed a light touch from its regulators, according to its autopsy, which was completed in August.Almost from the start, examiners with the F.D.I.C and the state of Georgia raised red flags. In 2002, F.D.I.C. officials found problems with the bank’s underwriting practices. Over the next few years, Haven’s portfolio of risky commercial real estate loans grew so quickly — by an astounding 40 percent annually — that the regulators raised questions about the dangers.But not until August 2008 did examiners step up their scrutiny by telling Haven to raise its capital cushion. A month later, the regulators issued a memorandum of understanding, known as an M.O.U., ordering the bank to limit its concentration of risky loans.Haven’s examiners “did not always follow up on the red flags,” says the report, which runs 29 pages. “By the time the M.O.U. was issued in September 2008, Haven’s failure was all but inevitable,” it concluded.But the fiasco at Haven Trust was not all that unusual. At the fast-growing Ocala National Bank in Florida, for example, examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found loose lending standards and a high concentration of construction loans.But regulators “took no forceful action to achieve corrections,” according a review after the failure. The bank collapsed in late January.At County Bank in California, a potential powder keg of construction and land loans warranted “early, direct and forceful” action from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, according to a review of the failed lender, which collapsed in early February.Regulators have begun to act on some of the lessons learned. Federal officials are discussing whether to impose hard limits, not just soft guidelines, on the portion of bank balance sheets that can be made up of commercial real estate loans. That would automatically prevent the buildup of risky assets and take more discretion out of the examiners’ hands.Other ideas include requiring all lenders to hold more capital if they report big concentrations of risky assets or rapid loan growth — an approach that is the centerpiece of the Obama administration’s policy for too-big-to-fail banks.Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor overseeing bank supervision, recently proposed to impose new rules that would require banks to raise capital in the event they breach certain financial thresholds in areas like loan delinquencies or defaults.At the F.D.I.C., Ms. Bair has been increasing the hiring of experienced examiners in the last few years, and recently empowered its on-site supervisors to impose restrictions on dividends, brokered deposits and loan growth. Every major regulator has urged examiners to take swifter action and issue more formal enforcement orders.Still, banking executives and some regulators worry that after the long period of lax oversight chronicled by the reports, regulators will crack down too hard. The challenge, these people say, is to strike a balance between rigorous oversight and oppressive regulation. A heavy hand might discourage banks from lending.“Right now, bankers don’t need to be told it is a dangerous world,” said William M. Isaac, the former F.D.I.C. chairman and now a regulatory consultant. “Right now, they need to be told there will be a tomorrow.”'"
"'09-11-19,'0','The European Union’s ombudsman on Wednesday criticized the antitrust inquiry that led to a 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion) fine against Intel, saying investigators failed to note statements that might have been relevant to the chip maker’s case.The ombudsman, P. Nikiforos Diamandouros, said investigators for the European Commission failed to record in their official minutes a meeting they held in August 2006 with a senior executive for Dell, the computer maker, even though the meeting focused on the central allegations in the case. “This constituted maladministration,” he said.But Mr. Diamandouros said the oversight did not prevent Intel from mounting its defense.After a nine-year investigation, the commission ruled in May that Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, had used improper rebates and incentives to persuade computer makers to use its processors over those of Advanced Micro Devices.The commission, in a statement, said it “does not agree with the ombudsman’s position that a formal, agreed minute should have been prepared.” It added that its practices were in accordance with European legal principles and rules of procedure.A lawyer for Intel, Ian S. Forrester, said the ombudsman’s finding called into question the unchecked nature of the commission’s investigative powers and would bolster Intel’s efforts to overturn the ruling at the European Court of First Instance.“The issue raises the broader question of whether the current procedures used by the European Commission to determine facts are adequate,” said Mr. Forrester, a partner at the law firm White & Case in Brussels. “The commission’s information-gathering process is in question. The European Commission has the only competition authority where the investigative team is the same one that drafts the decision.”'"

"'09-11-19,'0','Founded in 1927 by the bass player and songwriter Ignacio Piñeiro, Septeto Nacional performed at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair and is now composed of a fourth generation of musicians. The word salsa as a name for music from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean derives from a song that Mr. Piñeiro wrote in the 1930s and that the group still uses to open many of its shows: “Échale Salsita,” which means “Throw a little sauce on it” or “Spice it up a bit.”Septeto Nacional arrived in the United States on Nov. 7, played a concert at Hostos Community College in the Bronx that same evening; did a show the next night at a club in Nyack, N.Y.; spent most of last week performing in Puerto Rico; and then returned to New York on Monday. On Thursday night the band is scheduled to play at S.O.B.’s in the South Village, and then will travel to Miami, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles for additional engagements.“Our mission is to preserve the songs and the legacy of Ignacio Piñeiro,” who died in 1969, said Eugenio Rodríguez, the group’s lead singer and, at 68, the oldest member of the band both in age and years of service. He spoke between sets at the Guantanamera restaurant and club in Midtown on Monday night. “The contribution of the fourth generation has been to bring some new vigor and energy to that sound, which increases our enjoyment and that of our audience,” he added.The genesis of the current tour dates to 2003, when Cuban performers dominated nominations for the Latin Grammy in the traditional tropical album category. Some of Septeto Nacional’s members wanted to attend that awards ceremony, but were refused visas for reasons they said they still did not understand.“Maybe they thought we were terrorists and not musicians,” said Frank Oropesa, the band’s bongo player and an arranger. “You know, Ignacio Piñeiro played at the Apollo and recorded at Columbia Studios in the 1920s, and we have always been eager to see those places. So we were disappointed when we couldn’t come.”For both fans and performers of Latin music in the United States, Septeto Nacional’s return after 76 years has been treated as a historic event and extraordinary opportunity. Contemporary stars like Eddie Palmieri, Cheo Feliciano, Gilberto Santa Rosa and El Gran Combo have attended the band’s shows, and Septeto Nacional’s seven musicians were invited to give a master class at a conservatory in Puerto Rico.“It’s good for them to know us, and good for us to know them,” Mr. Oropesa said of American musicians. “We hope this kind of exchange can continue, because if you want to be a good musician, it is important to be exposed to as many styles and genres as possible.”The group’s tour is being organized by Leo Tizol, a Dominican-born promoter who worked previously with Septeto Nacional on a DVD. During the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, Mr. Tizol brought numerous Cuban groups to the United States, including Los Van Van, Orquesta Aragón and Los Papines, but that activity ceased once George W. Bush became president.“The door shut completely, and every effort to open it was frustrated,” Mr. Tizol said. “So I stopped trying. But when we heard the rumors it was again going to be possible” — after the Obama administration eased restrictions on travel, remittances and communication links to Cuba in April — “we decided to try again, and here they are.”So far, though, the flow seems to be all in one direction, from Cuba to the United States. Last month the New York Philharmonic, which had been invited by the Cuban government to perform in Havana, canceled its trip there because the United States government barred orchestra patrons from going along, citing Treasury Department regulations prohibiting American citizens from spending money in Cuba or visiting as tourists.A State Department official minimized the political significance of the new situation, saying, “Rather than evaluating these exchanges from a political point of view, we are simply processing them according to their merits under the immigration statutes.” He added that future cultural exchanges were also contingent on the Cuban government’s allowing creative artists there to travel freely, permission that is not always granted.The blogger Yoani Sánchez, for example, has twice been refused permission to travel to receive prizes in the United States and Spain for her writing. A spokesman for Cuba’s quasi-embassy in Washington, Alberto González, said his government has “always been open to all types of cultural exchanges” with the United States, but added one caveat: “Our interest is in healthy exchanges, without provocations, where both sides can learn, independent of ideology, but with respect” and not “part of a media war against Cuba,” his description of Ms. Sánchez’s activities.Members of Septeto Nacional said that they knew that they were breaking ground on their current tour, and added that they were glad to at last be able to “follow the trail of Ignacio Piñeiro.” But when Ricardo Oropesa, their tour manager, was asked if the group was also here as ambassadors, he seemed eager to steer clear of any political entanglement.“We are representatives of a people and a style of music, not of a system,” he said. “We have represented Cuban culture in the world for 82 years, and we play Cuban music anywhere that there are Cubans or other people who like our sound, even those who think differently.”'"

"'09-11-19,'0','The Earth’s oceans, which have absorbed carbon dioxide from fuel emissions since the dawn of the industrial era, have recently grown less efficient at sopping it up, new research suggests.Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels began soaring in the 1950s, and oceans largely kept up, scientists say. But the growth in the intake rate has slowed since the 1980s, and markedly so since 2000, the authors of a study write in a report in Thursday’s issue of Nature.The research suggests that the seas cannot indefinitely be considered a reliable “carbon sink” as humans generate heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.The slowdown in the rise of the absorption rate resulted from a gradual change in the oceans’ chemistry, the study found. “The more carbon dioxide the ocean absorbs, the more acidic it becomes and the less carbon dioxide it can absorb,” said the study’s lead author, Samar Khatiwala, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology.“It’s a small change in absolute terms,” Dr. Khatiwala said. “What I think is fairly clear and important in the long term is the trend toward lower values, which implies that more of the emissions will remain in the atmosphere.”'"
"'09-11-19,'0','The Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which has monitored Mr. Selechnik’s management practices since the 1970s, nicknamed him “Jake the Snake,” claiming that he mismanaged his buildings. Mr. Selechnik said that the coalition calls him that name only because it is angry that he won out in a bid to buy two buildings it wanted.Myra Goggins, a member of the group’s board, said that even though it has worked with housing corporations, it is a separate nonprofit groupAbout 30 residents of one of Mr. Selechnik’s buildings, at 3525 Decatur Avenue, in Norwood, filed complaints in housing court on Wednesday over what they described as a bedbug infestation, nonworking ramps for disabled residents and the lack of a full-time active superintendent, said one resident, Dane Pookrum. Mr. Selechnik said that only four or five tenants have bedbug problems and that when he tried to send an exterminator, Mr. Pookrum encouraged his fellow tenants not to allow him in.Harold Shultz, who worked for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development from 1974 to 2007, said that during his tenure, Mr. Selechnik “rose to the top of the pile for attention by the litigation bureau.”In 2006, there were 23,000 violations in 104 buildings associated with Mr. Selechnik and his family. In 2007, Mr. Selechnik sold 51 apartment buildings to a group of investors for $300 million, and with the sale, his violations declinedAs of last month, the department counted 5,775 violations in 55 buildings.But his management continues to draw attention. The department says Mr. Selechnik still owes $13,855 for outstanding violations.Garrett Wright, a staff lawyer with the Urban Justice Center’s Community Development Project, said Mr. Selechnik and his family stood out for how quickly they try to evict tenants.“You don’t see many landlords that are as aggressive” as Mr. Selechnik, said Mr. Wright, who is representing tenants of 2720 Grand Concourse in a case about how much of the cost of major improvements can be passed on to them.Mr. Selechnik denied those accusations and said he ran his buildings well. Mr. Selechnik, who says he seeks to remedy his violations — he puts the number at 4,814 — also said the city’s claim that he owed money was news to him.“I can sleep very comfortably at night. I know I made every possible effort to provide essential services,” he said. Mr. Selechnik was born in Guatemala City, where his parents moved in the 1920s from Lithuania. In 1956, he arrived in Manhattan to study at the Yeshiva Haichel Hatorah. Mr. Selechnik, an opera fan who savors Puccini, wanted to become a cantor.While taking music classes at Yeshiva University several years later, he worked at a Bronx rental office, where he heard about two buildings for sale, at 1269 and 1271 Morris Avenue. In the early 1960s, he bought them for $1,000. Soon, landlords who wanted to escape the Bronx’s growing blight started selling their buildings to Mr. Selechnik.In 1963, he met his wife, Arlyne, when she rented an apartment from him. They had two daughters, Robin and Ellen, who now help run his properties. His wife died in 1993.Even as he has grown into one of the Bronx’s biggest landlords, he has lived modestly. He works six days a week from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., in a graffiti-etched red-brick building behind a parking lot in the northwest Bronx. He swims every day after work at the Scarsdale Jewish Community Center. He attends the opera once or twice a season.He drives a 1989 Oldsmobile and rents a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. He said he pays a nominal amount for rent in exchange for sharing his construction workers with his landlord. Other than the $5,000 he gives to a yeshiva each month and saving for his grandchildren’s and great-grandchild’s education, he spends his money on his buildings, he says.“If you saw him, you probably would want to lend him a few dollars to get a cup of coffee,” said Marco Lala, an associate vice president for investments of Marcus & Millichap, who has sold Mr. Selechnik a dozen buildings over the past decade.His reputation worries government agencies and tenants-rights groups. Mary Dailey, who worked for the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition from 1986 to 2005, said it considered Mr. Selechnik “one of the most problematic” landlords in the borough because his properties were “chronically run down.” In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she helped organize campaigns against his effort to buy more buildings, she said. “Why would he change his patterns now?” Ms. Dailey asked.Some current tenants say that Mr. Selechnik and the relatives who work for him are quick to demand payment for major improvements — payments that rent laws authorize — but slow to make repairs.Dino Rossi, a resident of 2720 Grand Concourse, was notified on Dec. 24, 2007, that the monthly rent on his apartment would rise to $1,501.64 from $1,227.23 because of improvements. Mr. Rossi, 47, who shares the apartment with a roommate, joined his neighbors in fighting the increase.Despite the buildingwide projects, Mr. Rossi said, he said, he waited three years to get a rusty sink replaced and eight months to have water damage near his kitchen light fixture repaired.His roommate, Brady Sanabria, said the landlord put in kitchen cabinets — without handles — that are so shoddy that they splinter when they are wiped down.Some of Mr. Selechnik’s tenants praised him and said that landlords have an unenviable job.Nilsa Chacon, 24, who lived at 55 West 180th Street from 2005 to 2007, said Mr. Selechnik responded quickly to her requests for repairs on her $825-a-month one-bedroom apartment. “I can’t complain about that man,” she said of her landlord.Mr. Selechnik says that even though he loves his buildings like “my own children,” he may never satisfy his tenants.“I don’t think there is 100 percent happiness,” he said. “Because we dig into their pockets every month.”'"

"'09-11-20,'0','Citing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s call to civil disobedience, 145 evangelical, Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders have signed a declaration saying they will not cooperate with laws that they say could be used to compel their institutions to participate in abortions, or to bless or in any way recognize same-sex couples.“We pledge to each other, and to our fellow believers, that no power on earth, be it cultural or political, will intimidate us into silence or acquiescence,” it says.The manifesto, to be released on Friday at the National Press Club in Washington, is an effort to rejuvenate the political alliance of conservative Catholics and evangelicals that dominated the religious debate during the administration of President George W. Bush. The signers include nine Roman Catholic archbishops and the primate of the Orthodox Church in America.They want to signal to the Obama administration and to Congress that they are still a formidable force that will not compromise on abortion, stem-cell research or gay marriage. They hope to influence current debates over health care reform, the same-sex marriage bill in Washington, D.C., and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.They say they also want to speak to younger Christians who have become engaged in issues like climate change and global poverty, and who are more accepting of homosexuality than their elders. They say they want to remind them that abortion, homosexuality and religious freedom are still paramount issues.'"

Until then and given Tehran’s continued efforts to crack down on Ashraf through its Iraqi proxies, the United States must ensure that Ashraf residents are safe and not forcibly displaced inside Iraq.According to Article 45 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the United States’ responsibility toward Ashraf did not end with the transfer of protection of Camp Ashraf to Iraq earlier this year.Washington’s reluctance to fulfill its humanitarian obligations has only exacerbated concerns among Ashraf residents and their families in Iran and abroad.Although the United Nations has called on Iraq to treat the residents humanely, it is the United States that has a responsibility under the Geneva Conventions (and written commitments from Baghdad) to ensure that this happens.Our loved ones in Ashraf, contrary to the assertions of Iraqi Army officers in the article, are not “cultlike” or “too frightened to leave.” They are members of the main Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, who went to Ashraf of their own free will to strive for freedom and human rights in Iran.'"

"'09-11-20,'0','(Reuters) Increasing the levels of a message-carrying chemical in the brain may help prevent some of the memory deficits in Down syndrome that hinder learning and make it hard for the brain to develop normally, researchers said. They said mice with a rodent version of Down syndrome that were injected with drugs to increase levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which nerve cells use to communicate, showed improvements in their thinking ability. Down syndrome affects 5,000 newborns in the United States each year. “If you intervene early enough, you will be able to help kids with Down syndrome to collect and modulate information,” said Dr Ahmad Salehi of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, whose study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. In the study, the researchers found that the mice with Down syndrome-like dysfunction had lower amounts of norepinephrine in the brain than normal mice. But giving these mice drugs that boost levels of norepinephrine appeared to help.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','At one point, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi warned the audience — a group of governors, their aides and lobbyists — against attacks on Mr. Obama, suggesting this was a path to defeat. (Mr. Barbour showed no hesitation about critically invoking the names of two other Democrats who are not blessed by Mr. Obama’s popularity, Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader.)To a considerable extent, the tilting of these scales reflect the fact that governors tend to run different races than members of Congress, dealing with state and local concerns. Yet governors and Republican leaders said the tenor of the discussion also reflected the recognition that social issues no longer carried the punch they once might have.No one here was about to rebuke Mr. Rove or Mr. Bush. Yet their names were mentioned so infrequently that it was hard not to conclude that the party has moved beyond two men into a still uncertain future.Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a likely presidential candidate in 2012, said: “In my case, and I think it’s true in most areas that are politically competitive, what most people want to know about candidates and officeholders is this: ‘Will you keep my taxes reasonable, hopefully decreasing; can you help me get my kid to a school so he or she can get a decent education?’ ”Indeed, as a political issue — and also as a policy issue — these governors were much more likely to be focused on what Democrats were trying to do with health care than on gay marriage. Mr. Barbour said that he thought that Democrats were making a major miscalculation in assuming that getting a health care bill through Congress would, ultimately, prove to be a political advantage.“The Democrats seem to believe that cramming this down the American people’s throat will make them more popular,” Mr. Barbour said. “I think the American people will be livid if a political party on a partisan vote crams an enormous change down their throat.”As Mr. Barbour noted, next year’s gubernatorial elections are particularly important because governors elected in 2010 will help oversee the redrawing of state and Congressional district lines, based on the results of the 2010 census. That would give them significant impact on the political makeup of Congress and many state houses. And there are reasons for Republicans to be bullish: 19 of the 37 seats that are being contested next year are held by Democrats.Democrats face tough races in at least seven of those states, though Nick Ayres, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said he believed that number would increase. He said nine Democratic governors face electorates as restive as the one confronted by Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, who lost to Mr. Christie.Beyond that, he said, they would also have to cope with the same problem as R. Creigh Deeds, the Democrat who lost to Mr. McDonnell in Virginia.“They are going to face Deeds’s problems, where they really have two options going into their re-election: Do they stand with Reid and Pelosi on issues like national health care and appease their base or do they stand with taxpayers in their states unhappy with this plan,” he said.Still, however tough it may be to be a Democrat these days, it is tougher to be a governor, at the front lines of cutting services and raising taxes. While Republicans kept talking about the 9 or 10 Democratic seats they have in their sights, they were well aware of the fact that just as many Republican gubernatorial seats are equally vulnerable going into next year.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','WASHINGTON — Immigration enforcement officials said Thursday that they were expanding a program for auditing companies that might have hired illegal immigrants and had notified 1,000 companies this week that they would have to undergo such a review.John Morton, who heads Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, announced the new initiative, saying it was part of the administration’s plan to deal with companies that hire illegal workers. “ICE is focused on finding and penalizing employers who believe they can unfairly get ahead by cultivating illegal workplaces,” Mr. Morton said.He said that because the program was a law enforcement operation, he would not identify the companies that would undergo an audit except to say that they had been selected as a result of investigative leads and their connection to public safety and national security.The language suggests the audits will affect private companies involved in infrastructure operations like gas and electric utilities and contractors on military bases but not retailers and manufacturers of nonessential goods.The announcement of the action appears to be part of a two-pronged strategy by Homeland Security officials to crack down on companies that regularly rely on illegal workers while simultaneously trying to reward companies that are diligent in checking the documentation of prospective workers.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','Lincecum had 100 points, Carpenter 94 and Wainwright 90. The quirk for Wainwright was that he received only five second-place votes and 15 votes for third.“Both guys I was up against, in Wainwright and Carpenter, just had tremendous seasons,” Lincecum said. “Given that, especially what Carpenter came off of and what Wainwright did as a workhorse, I didn’t know how the cards were going to fall. It was a lucky one for me. I’ll take them as they come, I guess.”Carpenter, the 2005 N.L. winner, had reconstructive elbow surgery in 2007 and missed time this year with a pulled muscle in his side. He went 17-4 with a 2.24 earned run average in 28 starts; Wainwright was 19-8 with a 2.63 E.R.A.Lincecum, 25, was 15-7 with a 2.48 E.R.A. He joins seven other pitchers as back-to-back winners: Sandy Koufax, Denny McLain, Jim Palmer, Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson, a teammate of his in San Francisco last season.Like Kansas City’s Zack Greinke, who won the American League award on Tuesday with only 16 victories, Lincecum won despite a low win total. His 15 victories are the fewest ever for Cy Young-winning starter in a nonstrike season.Lincecum said he was vaguely familiar with Fielding Independent Pitching, or FIP, the statistic Greinke named as his favorite on Tuesday. Another nontraditional metric was important to Lincecum.“To say which one I look to the most, I would just say WHIP,” Lincecum said, referring to walks-plus-hits per inning, “just because you limit the amount of base runners that can hurt you.”The Arizona Diamondbacks’ Dan Haren led the National League in WHIP, at 1.003, followed by Carpenter (1.007), Javier Vazquez of the Atlanta Braves (1.026) and Lincecum (1.047). Ken Davidoff of Newsday, who voted for Lincecum, wrote on the newspaper’s Web site that he did not consider won-lost record because it clouded a voter’s judgment. Davidoff listed Wainwright second and Carpenter third, giving Wainwright the edge because he pitched more innings.Lincecum led the league in strikeouts, with 261, ranked second to Carpenter in earned-run average (2.48) and third in innings, with 225 1/3, behind Wainwright and Haren.Haren was 14-10 with a 3.10 E.R.A., and got a third-place vote from Will Carroll of Baseball Prospectus.Carroll voted Wainwright first and Lincecum second. He wrote that he left off Carpenter because “consistency and availability are two traits that I don’t think get measured well, but they have clear value for a pitcher.”The other voter to omit Carpenter was Keith Law of ESPN.com, who had Lincecum first, Vazquez second and Wainwright third. Vazquez was 15-10 with a 2.87 E.R.A. and ranked second to Lincecum in strikeouts, with 238.“I also gave him extra credit for pitching in the most difficult division in the N.L.,” Law wrote, “one in which he had to face two great offenses and only one patsy.”The voting for both Cy Young Awards showed writers paying more attention than ever to a wider array of statistics. Greinke benefited on Tuesday, and now Lincecum has, too.“You can see where the game is today — it’s turned into a game of complete numbers and statistics and what people do with that,” Lincecum said, adding later, “When there are so many numbers to be looked at, it makes the votes just completely different.”'"
"'09-11-20,'0','“What we are looking at is whether we feel that we can put down a number that would be provisional in effect, contingent on getting our legislation done,” he said. “Our inclination is to try to do that, but we want to be smart about it.”He noted that bills pending in Congress involved cuts of around 17 percent in emissions by 2020, increasing to much deeper cuts by 2030.The United States is one of the largest emitters in the world, second only to China, which has also refrained from setting a specific emissions reduction target, although as a developing country it would not be required to do so under the current outlines of the treaty that is being proposed.If neither China nor the United States made a commitment, the national plans of lesser emitters would have little practical effect.Although the United Nations no longer believes that the Copenhagen meeting can come up with a binding treaty to control emissions this year, the event is viewed as a crucial forum for the world’s nations to demonstrate a commitment to addressing global warming and its potential impact.This week, South Korea said it would cut emissions by 30 percent from “business as usual” by 2020. Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said his country would try to reduce emissions by 25 percent by then, instead of 15 percent as announced earlier. Last week, Brazil promised reductions of about 40 percent below current projections by 2020.The recent announcements are a mix of aspirations, good intentions and negotiating tactics. In most cases there is no certainty that the targets are politically or scientifically plausible. Still, they are a rough harbinger of the potential shape of future agreements and conflicts.United Nations officials have said they hope that the richest industrialized nations will promise to reduce their emissions to meet negotiated individual targets. For developing nations, the hope is that they will commit to reducing their future emissions to levels below those that would accrue if they took no action. The poorest nations would get money and technological assistance to adapt to the consequences of climate change.Many nations have based their new offers on that model. While some of the pledges are conditioned on reaching a binding international agreement, some countries, like South Korea, have said they will act whether the world did or did not.South Korea, whose emissions nearly doubled from 1990 to 2005, said it would cut emissions by investing in energy-efficient buildings and transportation, developing new green industries and changing patterns of consumption.“Our industry is really energy-intensive, so this is very ambitious,” Sang-Hyup Kim, South Korea’s secretary to the president for national future and vision, said in a phone interview from Seoul. He noted that the president and cabinet ministers had made the pledge in a building with the thermostat set low, and while wearing thermal underwear.Last week, Brazil said it would offer to reduce its emissions by 38 to 42 percent from current projections for 2020. About half of that reduction would result from slowing deforestation in the Amazon. Forests are a crucial force in absorbing carbon dioxide.The government described its action as a “political gesture” to show its good faith.But it is in many ways easier for developing countries and so-called industrializing countries, like South Korea and Brazil, to put forth offers because they are under far less pressure to commit themselves formally under an agreement.The industrialized countries — counted as those that were already industrialized when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992 — have the more concrete task of committing to specific reductions.Despite the steady stream of new pledges, representatives of many of the world’s poorest countries have expressed frustration over a recent decision by world leaders to defer a binding agreement until next year.“This is a major setback — we should not pretend otherwise,” Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, Sudan’s United Nations representative, said Thursday, speaking for a coalition of developing nations.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','WASHINGTON — The government watchdog overseeing the federal stimulus program testified Thursday that he could not vouch for the Obama administration’s recent claims that the money had saved or created 640,000 jobs. He suggested that the administration should have treated the number with more skepticism.The 640,000 figure, announced by the White House with some fanfare last month, came from reports filed by recipients of the stimulus money, many of which have been shown to be inaccurate or overstated since they were made public. But the watchdog, Earl E. Devaney, the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, said that it was also possible that the figure understated how many jobs were affected. Up to 10 percent of the recipients had not filed the required reports showing how many jobs they had created or saved, he said.“I have no doubt that there’s a lot of jobs being created,” Mr. Devaney said at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “I think it could be above or below 640. I think missing reports might drive the job numbers up, and I think there’s enough inaccuracies in here to question if the 640 number might go down.”When the White House announced the figures three weeks ago, officials hoped to reassure people that the $787 billion stimulus program was working in the face of rising unemployment. Many economists credit the stimulus with helping the economy, but tallying the actual jobs has proved difficult. A series of embarrassing reports — of raises being counted as new jobs, of jobs claimed in Congressional districts that do not exist, of school districts claiming to have saved the jobs of more teachers than they employ — may have ended up undermining confidence in the stimulus program.This week, Representative David Obey of Wisconsin, an influential Democrat who helped write the stimulus bill, issued a blistering statement calling the mistakes in the data “ludicrous” and “outrageous.”'"
"'09-11-20,'0','THESE days, even monsters have handlers.On a recent Monday morning at a cavernous design studio here, a quintet of colorful, uncategorizable creatures  or, at least, a group of people dressed to look like them  were being instructed on how to stand atop a long, narrow float that will soon make its maiden voyage in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.Crew members from the children’s television show “Yo Gabba Gabba!” were positioned around the float, directing a pink flower-bubble beast named Foofa on her ballet steps and telling a furry green unibrowed animal called Brobee how wide he could sweep his exceptionally long arms when he waves to parade watchers.On Thursday, when this psychedelic menagerie makes its way through Midtown Manhattan on a Keith Haringesque float (with a giant boombox at its center), “Yo Gabba Gabba!” will take its most significant step into mainstream popular culture, sharing a parade route with the likes of Spider-Man and Mickey Mouse. At the same time, a live tour based on the television series continues to travel the country, stopping at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan for three sold-out performances on Saturday.These milestones highlight how rapidly “Yo Gabba Gabba!,” a show aimed at a preschool audience and broadcast on Nickelodeon’s Nick Jr. channel, has built a fan base of young (and not-so-young) viewers with a mix of charming characters, catchy music and hip celebrity guests.They are also occurring at a time of growing pains for the show, when its producers are wondering if Nickelodeon  which does not produce “Yo Gabba Gabba!” itself, and instead licenses it from an outside studio  values their show as much as its other children’s franchises.“We’re a little bit of a stepchild,” Christian Jacobs, who created “Yo Gabba Gabba!” with Scott Schultz, said in a telephone interview.He added: “Everyone we work with creatively at Nickelodeon is so super-into the show. But we’re at a place in the business model where they’re like, ‘We don’t own that show, so we don’t necessarily want to push it.’ ”Now in its second season, “Yo Gabba Gabba!” has taken off in many measurable ways since its August 2007 debut: It is shown three times a day, seven days a week, on Nick Jr., and draws around 524,000 viewers an episode, according to Nielsen, about a third of whom are 18 and older. (By comparison, “Dora the Explorer,” which is shown on Nick Jr. in prime time, gets more than one million viewers). Nickelodeon said that “Yo Gabba Gabba!” videos averaged more than 1.3 million streams per month at the nickjr.com Web site.Its producers, however, prefer to focus on the eclectic lineup of performers who have been booked on the show, from the Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh and the rapper Biz Markie (who are featured regularly), to buzz bands like MGMT and the Shins (who played original songs), to Elijah Wood and Andy Samberg (who have boogied in the recurring “Dancey Dance Time” segment).In perhaps the ultimate act of cultural validation, Brad Pitt was photographed on Halloween dressed as DJ Lance Rock, the program’s human host. His costume was provided by Wildbrain, the studio that produces “Yo Gabba Gabba!” with the Magic Store, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Schultz’s company.“We had no idea he was a fan of the show,” said Michael Polis, the chief executive of Wildbrain, “but orange suits him.”Despite these accomplishments, the producers say that Nickelodeon’s long-term commitment to “Yo Gabba Gabba!” feels unclear.After their first season, they said they waited several anxious months for Nickelodeon to renew the show. Now they do not have a firm premiere date for a third season (which they recently wrapped shooting) or an order for a fourth.“If we were owned by them, like ‘SpongeBob SquarePants’ or ‘Dora the Explorer,’ it would be a no-brainer,” Mr. Jacobs said. “Which one of those shows had Jack Black on it for a whole episode, or got the Shins?”The producers also note that of the 44 merchandising deals that “Yo Gabba Gabba!” has struck in the United States and Canada  for everything from action figures to CDs to dinnerware  Nickelodeon has a stake only in the show’s home video, giving the network even less incentive to put its full weight behind the series.Brown Johnson, the Nickelodeon executive who brought “Yo Gabba Gabba!” to Nick Jr., said in a telephone interview that though the show was not a Nickelodeon-owned property, “it fits our brand incredibly well.”“The out-there creativity and the wonderful innocence in the show are a really good match for us,” Ms. Johnson continued.She said that a range of criteria factor into the network’s decision to renew a show, from ratings to cost-benefit analysis to online video hits to intangible cultural buzz. (“Brad Pitt was a big check mark in the good column,” Ms. Johnson said.)“It’s tough times,” she said, adding that the third season will most likely have its debut next year and that a verdict on a fourth season would be rendered “in about a year.”The current “Yo Gabba Gabba!” live tour and its Thanksgiving parade presence could provide further proof of the show’s viability.Before its United States itinerary, which concludes in Chicago on Dec. 5, “Yo Gabba Gabba!” spent two weeks in May on tour in Australia, where the show is broadcast on both Nick Jr. and that country’s public ABC television channel (and where the Australian branch of the parent-advice Web site babble.com described the show as “crack for toddlers”). This was followed in the summer by a handful of smaller stateside appearances by the DJ Lance Rock and Brobee characters.During this time Mr. Polis, a former executive with the Jim Henson Company, worked with Macy’s to secure a spot in its annual Thanksgiving parade, including a 90-second performance in front of the Herald Square store that will be shown on NBC.“We felt it could bring real pop to the parade,” Amy Kule, the Macy’s parade producer, said of the show. “It’s on the cusp of becoming something big.”As a late addition to the Macy’s lineup, the “Yo Gabba Gabba!” team built its float by converting one that was used in last year’s parade to promote Gwen Stefani’s Harajuku Lovers perfume.Mr. Jacobs, a founding member of the punk-pop band the Aquabats, said he relished the chance to “go into the parade as complete fly-by-night, low-budget, amateur dudes.” He emphasized that the float was being financed by Wildbrain and with funds raised from the live tour.Nickelodeon, he said, “if they wanted to, could jump in and say, ‘Hey, we want to co-sponsor it with you guys.’ ”“But really,” he continued, “this whole live thing, it’s all us.”Ms. Johnson of Nickelodeon said that the channel believed that Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Schultz were the best equipped to decide who their promotional partners should be, and gave them enormous latitude to choose the opportunities they want to pursue.“We really trust those guys to deliver high-quality, highly entertaining, kid-appropriate content,” she said. “There are very few times where we’ve had disagreements about anything.” She added, “I hope to be working with them for a long time.”Mr. Polis of Wildbrain called Nickelodeon “a great partner,” and said that he understood that the cable channel had a business to run.“They’ve got to focus on properties that they feel are going to provide them with the greatest return,” he said. “We do our best to offer them the opportunity to work with us.”Mr. Jacobs, too, was optimistic for the future of “Yo Gabba Gabba!” But for now, he was mostly concerned that its cast of characters remain with the parade float for the duration of its Thanksgiving Day journey.“We’re hoping it all works out,” he said. “Or it will be a complete disaster, and everyone will still talk about it. Either way, we can’t lose.”'"
"'09-11-20,'0','GENEVA (AP) — The World Trade Organization opened investigations Thursday into a European Union ban on American poultry and American labeling rules for cattle and hogs from Canada and Mexico.The organization also authorized Brazil to raise tariffs on United States goods to punish the United States for illegal cotton subsidies.In the poultry case, Washington and Brussels have argued for more than a decade over European restrictions on imports of poultry treated with four antibacterial chemicals approved in the United States but banned in Europe.Canada and Mexico are hoping the agency will rule against an American decision not to consider Mexican and Canadian calves raised and slaughtered in the United States as being cattle of American origin.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','There already has been action elsewhere. Australia became the first country to raise interest rates after the crisis. And Beijing’s bank regulator has started requiring commercial banks to look at the bank valuation and the transaction price, then to base the mortgage on whichever price is lower.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the equivalent of the city’s central bank, has instructed banks that loans on homes selling for 20 million Hong Kong dollars, or $2.6 million, or more must be capped at 60 percent. The cap had previously been 70 percent. And the Hong Kong Mortgage Corp., which issues second mortgages, said it would no longer make loans to investors and cut its maximum loan size.In early November, Singapore also suggested it would introduce cooling measures. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said there should be “close monitoring” of home prices and transactions. The central bank already had scrapped a system of “interest-only” loans, which the bank believed was making it easy to “flip” apartments.Hong Kong and China were the first places in Asia to see real-estate values recover this year. The mainland government introduced a mammoth stimulus package of 4 trillion yuan, or $586 million and the program freed up Chinese bank lending, and prompted the country’s annual rate of economic growth to return to pre-crisis levels.According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, China’s economy was forecast to grow at a rate of 8.7 percent this year and expand to 10.1 percent in 2010. The slowest recent growth was in the first quarter of 2009, when annualized growth fell to 6.1 percent.In September property prices in the “Big Four” Chinese cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — already were 6 percent to 9 percent higher than their peaks in the previous upturn. Now there is mounting speculation that the Chinese government will introduce measures to curb the rapid rise.Xavier Wong, research head for greater China at Knight Frank real estate, believes the central government will act next year, raising mortgage rates and introducing administrative measures to combat price increases.“The tendency of Chinese citizens to accumulate substantial savings and their fixation with investing in bricks and mortar may mean that China’s property market upcycle will last longer than those in the West, though the risk of an investment bubble should not be taken lightly,” Mr. Wong stated in a November report.The recovery has spread across North Asia to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as to Singapore and parts of Southeast Asia. Residential real estate has led the way, but the slide in commercial rents also has slowed. Project funding for institutional deals, which had dried up, has started to return, although analysts say it is still a concern.In Singapore, sales volumes turned around in February, after the Lunar New Year. Nassim Park Residences and The Ritz-Carlton Residences Singapore Cairnhill grabbed headlines for high-profile sales. And activity in the secondary market, the resale of existing homes, has tracked the bullish interest in new high-end apartments. Colliers real estate says one of the turning points was a strong launch for The Caspian, a 712-unit development at Boon Lay Way and Lakeside Drive. Over all, a total of 2,108 new apartments came on the market in the second quarter, triple the pace of the first three months of the year.The most eye-catching deal was in Hong Kong, where an apartment in Henderson Land’s 39 Conduit Road development set a world record in October when it sold for 439 million dollars, or 88,000 dollars per square foot by net area. On that basis, it replaced One Hyde Park, a London luxury development nearing completion, as the most expensive residential real estate in the world.The previous record at the height of Hong Kong’s 1997 property bubble was only 23,000 dollars per square foot.Is another bubble building in Asia?“Arguably, yes — it has created some localized asset price bubbles or early bubbles,” said Simon Smith, head of research and consultancy in Hong Kong for Savills real estate. “The China stimulus is having an impact well beyond China’s borders. Many of the economies in Asia are much more China-dependent than they used to be.”Central bankers and policy makers now have to walk a tightrope. “The problem is that the last thing the government wants to do is hurt the recovery,” Mr. Smith said. “They would rather struggle with the problem of higher asset values than negative equity.”'"
"'09-11-20,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Thursday that the government would end its $700 billion bailout program “as soon as we can,” and that part of it would be used to lower the federal debt.During a sometimes contentious Joint Economic Committee hearing that included one lawmaker calling on him to resign, Mr. Geithner was pressed to disclose the administration’s plan for dealing with the unpopular financial rescue program.“We are winding it down and will close it as soon as we can,” Mr. Geithner said of the $700 billion bailout fund, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Congress approved TARP at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008 as a way to supply banks with fresh capital.Mr. Geithner said “substantial resources” remaining in the fund would be used to pay down the national debt, which is being pushed higher by record deficits, including a $1.42 billion imbalance for the budget year that ended Sept. 30.While pledging to end TARP as quickly as possible, Mr. Geithner also said the administration did not want to repeat the mistake of other countries by ending government support too fast and derailing a fledgling economic recovery.But Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, said the economy was such a mess that Mr. Geithner, as the Obama administration’s chief economic spokesman, should resign immediately.'"
"'09-11-20,'0','France moved a step closer Thursday to issuing billions of euros in bonds to raise money to promote growth industries, even as a leading research group warned it could damage the country’s long-term fiscal future.Two former prime ministers, commissioned by President Nicolas Sarkozy to study the most promising areas of investment, submitted proposals for a total of 35 billion euros ($52 billion) in new state spending.The two former leaders, Michel Rocard and Alain Juppé, recommended that about half, 16 billion euros, go to universities and research. They also suggested investment should be focused on measures preparing France for a low-carbon economy, notably in transportation, urban design and energy policy.The “grand loan,” as the bond has been known since Mr. Sarkozy floated the idea in June, when the country was still in recession, comes at a time when economists at home and abroad are warning of rising debt levels and their implication for economic growth in years to come.European Union officials have called on member states to begin planning now to wind down economic stimulus measures starting in 2011 to prevent budget deficits and debt levels from spiraling out of control, possibly undermining confidence in the euro.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in a semi-annual economic outlook, added its doubts about the “grand loan” as well.'"

"'09-11-21,'0','Where was Alex Chilton on Wednesday night? At the Brooklyn Masonic Temple, he was onstage, more or less, standing at the far right, sometimes even near his microphone (and sometimes even using it). But as has been the case on and off for the last couple of decades, he was frustratingly hard to find.It was the first New York show in several years for Big Star, Mr. Chilton’s band, still plying the songs that for a few years in the early 1970s helped shape what power pop was to become, even if it was coolly received at the time. (An impressive Big Star boxed set, “Keep an Eye on the Sky,” was released on Rhino in September.)But memories are made in a variety of ways. The resurrection of Big Star in the early 1990s cemented its legend, and also the lineup: Mr. Chilton, who also played guitar, and the drummer Jody Stephens from the original group, rounded out by the guitarist Jon Auer and the bassist Ken Stringfellow, who were enlisted more than 15 years ago to fill out the band during its first comeback and never left.On Wednesday Big Star motored through its catalog in polite and dutiful fashion: about 20 songs in a little more than an hour, with Mr. Chilton at the microphone only slightly more often than Mr. Auer and Mr. Stringfellow. Maybe he was conserving energy for when it counted: “Thirteen” still had some of its old petulance, and “Do You Wanna Make It” — from the 2005 album “In Space” — could have passed for a song from the early years.But Mr. Chilton rarely appeared fully committed. In between many songs, he’d pull his glasses out of his front pocket, put them on, then bend over, presenting his bald spot to the crowd as he presumably read from the set list taped to the stage near his feet. Mr. Stephens sang lead, distantly, on “Way Out West” and “For You,” and his drumming was often lethargic.That left the burden of energy on the band’s newer members, particularly Mr. Auer, who managed to be a humble and engaging frontman without ever explicitly taking the helm. He sang “I Am the Cosmos” with a bit of snarl, and gave strong definition to “Lady Sweet.”'"
"'09-11-21,'0','“The Drug Industry Cashes In” (editorial, Nov. 18) correctly points out that the drug industry’s price escalations threaten to make a mockery of its deal with the Senate Finance Committee and the Obama administration.I remember well how President John F. Kennedy responded to the announcement made by Roger Blough, chairman of United States Steel, that the company had increased the price of steel, contrary to what President Kennedy thought was Mr. Blough’s promise not to do so.His public condemnation of the steel industry and the businessmen who ran it was followed by swift action that resulted in a rollback of the price increases. It also sent a message to the nation as a whole: that this president was to be taken seriously.What we need from President Obama is less rhetoric and tougher action.Now that the price of prescription drugs has risen by 9 percent in the past year, it’s imperative for the White House to scrap its “deal” with drug companies, which from the get-go was too high a price to pay for their nonopposition to health care reform.How many more concessions have to be made to the private sector before the American public wakes up to the fact that health care and medications cannot be subject to the same laws of supply and demand as the rest of the free market?Now that Big Pharma has upped the ante, it’s up to President Obama to call its bluff.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','The recommendations for reduced screening for breast and cervical cancer embrace a remarkable premise — that there are some things we’re better off not knowing.The screening procedures themselves, of course, don’t require anyone to do anything. If we think unnecessary tests or treatments will follow, that will be because we expect patients — and their doctors — to use the information produced to make the “wrong” decisions.But those decisions are “wrong” only as a statistical matter. Whether or not they are wrong for any individual will be a matter of personal attitude toward risk and, in truth, of personal priorities in life.This distinction illustrates again the inevitable tension between individual and collective interests in the operation of our health care system, a tension at the heart of the current debate.The science speaks for itself: mammograms are not an effective means of preventing breast cancer mortality among women younger than 50.But this argument and all the controversy surrounding it miss the point that advocacy groups and young women who have survived breast cancer are trying to make in the wake of the latest recommendations: since this disease was discovered and named, we have not made any progress in combating breast cancer mortality among younger women, and this needs to change.Recommending against screening mammography in younger women is smart. Increasing research efforts that focus on decreasing mortality, as well as media campaigns that help increase Congressional support for such efforts, is smarter.Robert Aronowitz points out that one of 1,900 women in their 40s will be saved by 10 years of mammography. This must total many thousands of women in America, and it has not been adequately explained why these lives should be sacrificed. Obviously, the lives saved must be balanced against the consequences of false positives, but few media accounts spell out these consequences.Dr. Aronowitz, at least, gives us a number: for every life saved, there are 1,000 false positives, all of whom will needlessly suffer great anxiety. Arguably, though, that is a reasonable price to pay to save one life.What has not been adequately explained are the other consequences of these false positives. How many of those 1,000 women die, and how many suffer greatly, as a result of needless surgery and toxic therapy? This crucial information is missing from every account I have read.The writer is a professor of molecular and cell biology in the Cancer Research Lab, University of California, Berkeley.I have been somewhat disappointed at the superficial level of the mammography debate. To me and to others, I believe, a major concern is the level of radiation we are subjecting our patients to.Ionizing radiation presents potential dangers, cancer being the obvious one, but there are others. At the end of the day, we must ask ourselves how many cancers may be caused by an extra burden of radiation versus how many cancers will be diagnosed. This is far from a trivial concern.Added to the mammograms are the CT scans done, frequently for defensive purposes, on an ever-increasing scale. Mammograms, as well as other X-ray and related techniques, come at a cost, not only in dollars, but in real health dangers. We must continue to practice the dictum “First, do no harm.”The writer is an internist.As a pediatric nurse practitioner who has been doing Pap smears on adolescents for more than 20 years, I applaud the new Pap smear guidelines, while I have serious reservations about the new mammography guidelines.First, we have much more data about the cause and development of cervical cancer than breast cancer. Human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted organism, causes cervical cancer. HPV, like chlamydia and other S.T.D.’s, is much more prevalent in teenagers, for reasons having to do with the cellular immaturity of their cervixes.More than 90 percent of that HPV resolves on its own in women with normal immune systems. Therefore, yearly Pap smears in teenagers essentially find HPV (which is likely to resolve on its own) rather than cancer.Furthermore, there is a real downside to yearly testing. Recent studies show that the invasive procedures that follow abnormal Paps can have serious side effects, including increased likelihood of premature births.I hope that women do not view the new Pap smear screening guidelines through the same lens as the mammography guidelines. They are apples and oranges.The writer is assistant dean for research, Hunter College School of Nursing.'"

"'09-11-21,'0','“He’s maybe a little more focused because there’s not as many guys for him to hang out with and things for him to do,” Jason said of Devin in a telephone interview from Nashville.The Titans have a disappointing 3-6 record but have won their last three games. Jason, the Titans’ sixth-round draft choice in April, has started three games and has found a niche on special teams.“He’s adjusted to that life,” Devin said of Jason after a Rutgers practice this week. “And the one good thing is that he’s having fun.”They were born in Nyack, N.Y., and moved with their mother to Nanuet, N.Y., when they were in junior high. Those were the only days they competed against each other on different teams, and only in basketball.Jason said, “You always wanted to see your brother do well — score a lot of points.”The twins decided to go to St. Joseph, which is in Bergen County, N.J., about a 15-minute drive from Nanuet.Karcich, a coach for more than three decades, holds a summer football camp that a boy from Wyckoff, N.J., named Greg Schiano used to attend. Even before Schiano became the coach at Rutgers in 2001, he had re-established ties with Karcich.One of Karcich’s players, Ron Girault, had a fine career as a defensive back at Rutgers, and Karcich let Schiano know that the McCourty twins were prospects.But Devin injured a hip and missed the first three games of their senior year. Karcich also used Jason at running back, and he rushed for nearly 1,100 yards for an 11-1 team that won a state championship.At that point, the twins were prepared to go their separate ways. Boston College had recruited Jason but not Devin, and Jason liked what the Eagles had to offer. Then Jason and Devin took a recruiting trip to Rutgers together.“When Jason went on his visit to Boston College, Devin didn’t go with him,” their mother said, “but when they went to Rutgers, he felt more of a connection. The people felt more like what he’s used to.”They signed letters of intent with Rutgers at 8 a.m. on the first day allowed. They moved into a suite together on campus, but Jason played as a true freshman, and Devin did not.“You knew they would be special guys,” Schiano, who has twin 10-year-old sons, said this week. “Jason was just a little more physically mature because he had played more as a high school senior.”As a freshman, Jason helped Rutgers reach the 2005 Insight Bowl, the Scarlet Knights’ first bowl game in 27 years, and Jason and Devin — both listed then at 5 feet 11 — helped the 2006 Rutgers team finish 11-2. Rutgers went to bowls in all three seasons they played together.The twins say they never talked about their playing days together coming to an end — it would just happen, sooner or later. As Devin said: “It’s the next step in life. It was a blessing — we could enjoy ourselves and go to the same college.”Jason received a bachelor’s degree in information technology. Devin is one course from earning his degree in sociology. Devin would like to play in the N.F.L. next year.Harrell, their mother, has Rutgers and Titans schedules on her refrigerator door, and she has seen both play this season. She planned to travel from Nashville to Syracuse this week with their older brother, Larry. She may need to juggle her schedule next year, too.Jason said of Devin: “With his play this year, he’ll definitely get an opportunity to play somewhere next year. I think it’ll be even more enjoyable for my mom and older brother to see both of us play at the highest level.”'"
"'09-11-21,'0','ALBANY — Moody’s Investors Service this week warned that the state’s credit rating could be downgraded if the Legislature does not take serious steps to close the $3.2 billion budget gap and revenue continues to lag.The warning, released on Thursday, comes as Gov. David A. Paterson presses lawmakers to come to a consensus on how to address the deficit after weeks of sputtering negotiations. Mr. Paterson has urged reductions to schools and health care, which have long been third rails of state budget politics.“This is a lot more serious than the interests of some of the legislators who would rather go home and be heroes saying, ‘Look, I didn’t cut school aid,’ or ‘Look, I didn’t cut health care,’ ” Mr. Paterson said at a news conference Friday morning in Albany. “People had better get serious here.”In its statement, Moody’s warned against one-time measures to close the gap, saying the state must address a stubborn reality: It is spending more than its revenue will support. Lawmakers, for example, have suggested that they may refinance the state’s tobacco bonds and use the proceeds to plug the hole for now, until the economy improves.“The next three months will be critical to the state’s credit rating,” the Moody’s statement read.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','Mr. Gault added: “I don’t think it’s right to look at it by saying, ‘Well, the economy is still doing extremely badly, therefore the stimulus didn’t work.’ I’m afraid the answer is, yes, we did badly but we would have done even worse without the stimulus.”In interviews, a broad range of economists said the White House and Congress were right to structure the package as a mix of tax cuts and spending, rather than just tax cuts as Republicans prefer or just spending as many Democrats do. And it is fortuitous, many say, that the money gets doled out over two years — longer for major construction — considering the probable length of the “jobless recovery” under way as wary employers hold off on new hiring.But there are criticisms, mainly that the Obama team relied last winter on overly optimistic economic assumptions and oversold the job-creating benefits of the stimulus package.Optimistic assumptions in turn contributed to producing a package that if anything is too small, analysts say. “The economy was weaker than we thought at the time, so maybe in retrospect we could have used a little bit more and little bit more front-loaded,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, another financial analysis group, in St. Louis.While some conservatives remain as skeptical as ever that big increases in government spending give the economy a jolt that is worth the cost, Martin Feldstein, a conservative Harvard economist who served in the Reagan administration, said the problem with the package was that some of its tax cuts and spending programs were of a variety that did little to spur the economy.“There should have been more direct federal spending that would have added to aggregate demand,” he said. “Temporary tax cuts and one-time transfers to seniors were largely saved and didn’t stimulate spending.”Even the $787 billion price tag overstates the plan’s stimulus value given changes made in Congress, economists say. Nearly a tenth of the package, $70 billion, comes from a provision adjusting the alternative minimum tax so it does not hit middle-income taxpayers this year. That routine fix, which would do nothing to stimulate the economy, was added in part to seek Republican votes. But to keep the package’s overall cost down, provisions that would stimulate the economy — like aid to revenue-starved states and infrastructure projects — got less as a result.Among Democrats in the White House and Congress, “there was a considerable amount of hand-wringing that it was too small, and I sympathized with that argument,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com and an occasional adviser to lawmakers.Even so, “the stimulus is doing what it was supposed to do — it is contributing to ending the recession,” he added, citing the economy’s third-quarter expansion by a 3.5 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate. “In my view, without the stimulus, G.D.P. would still be negative and unemployment would be firmly over 11 percent. And there are a little over 1.1 million more jobs out there as of October than would have been out there without the stimulus.”Politically, however, the president is saddled with his original claim that, with the stimulus, the jobless rate would peak at 8.1 percent — a miscalculation that Republicans constantly recall. While the administration has said its economic assumptions were in line with private forecasts, most of which also underestimated the recession’s punch, it was more optimistic than most.“That was a mistake,” said Jeffrey A. Frankel, a Harvard University economist and former Clinton administration official who is a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research panel that judges when recessions start and end. “I thought so at the time.”Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, said attention to that too-rosy projection “prevents people from focusing on the positive impact of the fiscal stimulus. So of course I find that frustrating.”Much federal infrastructure money has gone not to new job-creating projects but to finance existing plans, which otherwise would be unaffordable to states.So the stimulus has not “supercharged” transportation construction as was hoped, said Charles Gallagher, an asphalt company owner, speaking for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, but it has nonetheless been “a welcome Band-Aid” to offset state cuts.“Many contractors across the nation have been able to sustain, if not add to, their work force,” he said.That sort of impact is what makes federal aid to state governments rank high in economists’ reckoning of the stimulus value of various proposals. Every dollar of additional infrastructure spending means $1.57 in economic activity, according to Moody’s, and general aid to states carries a $1.41 “bang” for each federal buck.Even more effective are increases for food stamps ($1.74) and unemployment checks ($1.61), because recipients quickly spend their benefits on goods and services.By contrast, most temporary tax cuts cost more than the stimulus they provide, according to research by Moody’s. That is true of two tax breaks in the stimulus law that Congress, pressed by industry lobbyists, recently extended and sweetened — a tax credit for homebuyers (90 cents of stimulus for each dollar of tax subsidy) and extra deductions for businesses’ net operating losses (21 cents).Economists said Republicans’ recent proposals to rescind unspent money would be a mistake.James Glassman, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company, said: “If we could be absolutely convinced that the growth we’re getting is for reasons beyond the help the government is giving, then that would make sense. But the fact is we can’t be certain of that.”'"
"'09-11-21,'0','These types of businesses have popped up around the country, but took off in when it made the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test, or Olsat, a reasoning exam, and the Bracken School Readiness Assessment, a knowledge test, the universal tests for gifted admissions beginning in 2008.Kayla’s session at Bright Kids was an initial assessment; her mother, Jena Rosenblum, had not decided whether to put her through a full course of tutoring. She was considering it at the suggestion of Kayla’s preschool teacher. “Even though we live in the West Village and there are great public schools, obviously, any opportunity to step it up a notch in caliber, we would like to try,” Ms. Rosenblum said.Melisa Kehlmann said her main concern was that her 4-year-old son, Adrian, would be shut out of the well-regarded but overcrowded schools in her neighborhood.“It’s quite pricey, but compared to private school, which averages about $20,000 for kindergarten, the price is right,” she said of the tutoring. “I just want the opportunity to have a choice.”Private schools warn that they will look negatively on children they suspect of being prepped for the tests they use to select students, like the Educational Records Bureau exam, or E.R.B., even though parents and admissions officers say it quietly takes place. (Bright Kids, for example, also offers E.R.B. tutoring.)“It’s unethical,” said Dr. Elisabeth Krents, director of admissions at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side. “It completely negates the reason for giving the test, which is to provide a snapshot of their aptitudes, and it doesn’t correlate with their future success in school.”No similar message, however, has come from the public schools. In fact, the city distributes 16 Olsat practice questions to “level the playing field,” said Anna Commitante, the head of for the city’s Department of Education.As for parents doing more — like hiring a tutor — Ms. Commitante said she finds “anything else a little too stressful for young kids” but that “we can’t dictate what parents choose to do.”There is no state registry or licensing for these services, but an Internet search turns up numerous companies with names like Another Young Scholar, Junior Test Prep and Thinking to Learn. Harley Evans, the owner of Manhattan Edge Educational Programs, raised prices this year to $90 a session from $65, but still has his maximum load of 70 children. Daniel C. Levine, the founder of Exclusive Education, based in Manhattan, said that a few years ago, 2 percent of his clientele were children under 6. Now it is about 10 percent.“It’s the same phenomenon as with the SATs: a gradual rise in test prep, until it becomes the norm,” said Emily Glickman, a Manhattan educational consultant. “Given that the demand for high-stakes schools outstrips supply, that’s what’s happening.”Some of the thousands of students registered to take the gifted tests in January are also preparing at home. Bright Kids is selling a few hundred $90 workbooks per month, said Bige Doruk, the company’s founder. Dr. Robin MacFarlane, who developed the Kindergarten Test Study System, said she was on track to sell more than a thousand of the $60 Olsat prep kits this year, though she advises parents against intensive cramming.Tutoring preschoolers is not quite the same as drilling high school students for the SAT. At Bright Kids, Kayla was initially stumped by the visual analogy, but once the learning specialist, Meredith Resnick, explained that she was looking at a whole-to-part relationship, she easily found the right answer: a slice of bread. “You can see that when I scaffolded her, she knew it,” Ms. Resnick said.Children often have to be trained to listen to questions from strangers and to sit still for about an hour, the time it takes to complete the two tests.“If their mind isn’t keyed into listening, the whole question can fly over their heads,” said one tutor, a retired teacher in gifted programs.She spoke on condition of anonymity because she has administered the test for the city and wants to do so again.“Some kids can do well without preparation, but children who are familiar have an edge,” the tutor said. From an equity perspective, she said, “it’s ridiculous.”Ms. Commitante said the city had not noticed any bias due to test preparation. For this year’s kindergarten class, 3,231 students scored in at least the 90th percentile, the minimum to qualify for a gifted program, a 45 percent increase from the year before.But that rise was attributable to “a variety of factors,” including increased participation, she said: 14,822 took the tests, an increase of 19 percent. The percentage scoring 90 percent or higher rose to 22 percent from 18 percent.“I would hope that parents make decisions around this program because they feel that this is an educational option that their child really needs, as opposed to, ‘I have to get my child into this program because that’s the only place where they are going to get a good education,’ ” she said. “I just don’t think that’s true — we have a lot of really good schools.”'"
"'09-11-21,'0','You get it right away, right? Just because it’s so obvious doesn’t mean it’s not a good idea. People love dogs. Dogs love ice cream. But people don’t like what ice cream does to their dogs, specifically, their dogs’ stomachs. Neither do the dogs. Neither do the carpets.So why not make ice cream dogs can tolerate?This was the idea Christian Liendo stumbled on at the tender age of 16. Christian, a bright-eyed science buff from Flushing, Queens, who is the son of a cabdriver, has lots of great ideas  he’s just been waiting for someone to ask him to do something with them. Last summer, he enrolled in an entrepreneurial program and competition sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Prep for Prep, a nonprofit that identifies minority students and prepares them, during summers and weekends, for private schools. Christian, now a junior at Columbia Prep, started working with the group after fifth grade.For the competition, Christian started with the idea of toothpaste squeezers  sure, they exist, but not as child-friendly collectibles, each one with a different cartoon character. Still, he and his instructor worried, how many toothpaste squeezers does a child need? Next he thought of a women’s shoe with an adjustable heel, so she can go low on the subway and high for dinner out. But it turns out such a thing is already out there, and manufacturing seemed too complicated for his low budget.Finally, he hit on a nexus of relative originality and practicality. Because both his parents work, Christian spent a lot of his childhood at the home of his grandmother. It was an arrangement that came with perks: time with his grandmother’s dog, Max, a friendly cocker spaniel; and an after-school snack of vanilla ice cream. On a visit to his grandmother’s this summer, as he watched Max whine for a taste of the stuff, it suddenly dawned on Christian: New York has dog bakeries, dog spas, dog therapists; how was it that the canine market wasn’t already saturated with local, artisanal ice creams?With his mother’s help, Christian started experimenting with carob powder (chocolate is dangerous for dogs), soy milk and lactose-free milk. He gave tastes to friends’ dogs and to Max. Corn and carrot were bigger hits than chocolate and vanilla (an indication of the limits of dogs’ intelligence).Given samples, the students in Christian’s class came back for seconds. At a recent tasting, the carrot had a bright, not-too-sweet flavor, and a consistency on the refreshing side of icy. At least it looked like that’s what Max would have said had he been able to verbalize it.THE judges awarded first prize and $1,200 to a young woman who made vegan cookies. Judging from competition winners in this and past years, the future of entrepreneurship lies in tasty things, green things, animal-friendly things or things that are some combination therein: vegan dog biscuits, low-sugar power bars (for humans), environmentally friendly stuffed animals.Christian, who won an honorable mention, thought he had something to bring to the niche market: a more upscale version of what Purina, for example, sells in grocery stores. “It won’t be in supermarkets,” Christian said of his creation. “It’s going to be sold in ice cream stores.” That way, he explained, dog owners won’t feel bad when they stop for a cone and their dogs whimper in longing.Christian did win $250, and he is trying to figure out how to save enough money to scale up the project.As much as Christian loved the entrepreneurial program, next summer he hopes to get a job to earn some seed money. He said that he always envisioned himself becoming a math or science academic, but that “if this business works out, that would be great.”This is what the best youth empowerment nonprofits do: dangle a carrot  or some carrot ice cream  in front of young people, then inspire them to set their own goals. They do more than just ask for ideas, they challenge students to see how far they can take them.Christian’s family has only one concern about the project: Max is getting chubby. A side business in personal trainers for dogs may not be far behind.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has not awarded any federal grant money directly to the antipoverty group Acorn over the last seven years, but about $200,000 has made its way to the organization or its affiliates, according to an internal audit released Friday.Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, is the largest neighborhood-based antipoverty group in the country, and has become a prime target for conservative critics. In recent months, government agencies have moved to distance themselves from the organization, and Congress has voted to ban future grants to it.The review added only a relatively minor amount of money to the $53 million in federal aid from other sources that Acorn was already known to have received since 1994.The review was undertaken by the department’s inspector general at the request of Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee.It found that Acorn had directly applied for five department grants since 2002, but that all five were denied. Still, some money reached the group or its affiliates through other grantees who sub-awarded it to Acorn to help carry out a program.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','The case of the missing mezuzah will go to trial.Last week the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, ruled that a case may go forward involving a family’s fight to affix a small box containing Hebrew religious texts, known as a mezuzah, to the doorposts of their condominium units. The mezuzah has deep importance for many Jews as a sign of faith, but for the family of Lynne Bloch, it is also a symbol of battle.The Blochs have lived in the Shoreline Towers condominium in Chicago for three decades. In May 2004, the condo association began a hallway renovation and asked residents to remove everything from their doors, including mezuzot (the plural of mezuzah). The Blochs took the mezuzot down from their three apartments, then replaced them when the renovations were complete. But the condo management removed them, and did so repeatedly so when the Blochs put them up again — even on the day of the funeral of the family patriarch, Marvin Bloch. The family sued the condo association in 2005.The City of Chicago has since banned condo restrictions on doorway religious symbols, as did the state legislature; the condo board has changed its policy. But the Blochs continued their lawsuit, pressing for damages over their treatment.A lower court, followed by a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit, blocked the trial last year, but in a highly unusual move, the full court agreed to rehear the case and last week overruled the earlier decision.A lawyer for the condo complex, David C. Hartwell, noted that the Seventh Circuit relied on an account provided entirely by the plaintiffs for the purpose of deciding if their claims were enough to merit a trial. Now that the case is moving forward, more details will emerge, and “people are going to be somewhat shocked and amazed,” he said.He insisted that the dispute is about condo board politics, not anti-Semitism. “This case is really about intense discord” between Mrs. Bloch and the board president, he said.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','Mahler’s Seventh Symphony is probably the least popular of his nine works in the genre. Completed in 1905, it was the last of his symphonies to enter the repertory of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which didn’t perform it until 1978.But the orchestra offered a nuanced interpretation at Carnegie Hall on Thursday, led by Christoph Eschenbach, its music director from 2003 to 2008. Mr. Eschenbach’s relationship with the players during his tenure was often acrimonious, and some complained about a lack of chemistry. But the partnership may be happier now that the pressure of a full-time relationship is off; it certainly seemed solid on Thursday.Unlike other Mahler symphonies, the huge Seventh has no program, and it lacks any narrative sweep or defining trait, like the heroic character of the Fifth or the tragic air of the Sixth. The work has puzzled audiences but garnered prominent fans, including Schoenberg and Webern, who appreciated its modernist tinges.“It is my best work and predominantly of a cheerful character,” Mahler wrote, although he suffered severe writer’s block during its composition. He overcame this hurdle when, as he was being rowed across a lake, the rhythm and sound of the oars in the water inspired the mysterious introductory theme of the opening movement.The Philadelphia Orchestra played with plenty of tension in those opening bars, with the haunting melody of the tenor horn rising above the dark rumblings of the string section, which glowed throughout the evening. The cellos sounded particularly lovely in the first “Night Music” section.David Kim, the concertmaster, offered an evocative solo in the Andante amoroso movement (also titled “Night Music”), in which Mahler made the unusual decision to include a guitar and a mandolin. An occasional blooper aside, the brass playing was generally fine.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','Ms. Ghansam had hers first. Afterward, though weak and still sedated, she said she asked about her husband “a thousand times” after his procedure the next day. They could not stay in the same room because their shared surname meant their medications might have been confused. But as soon as he was out of surgery, she dragged herself to his room next door to visit.“Oh, we were the talk of the hospital,” Ms. Ghansam said.But reality set in soon after their release. The incision in Ms. Ghansam’s chest was taking forever to heal, and Mr. Ghansam needed stents in seven of his arteries. Then there was their home on Kiamesha Lake. They had lived there free in exchange for managing the property, which included enough land for chickens and ducks and a garden full of peppers and tomatoes.“I came home on June 5, he came home June 6, and on the 8th, the landlord said that we had to move,” Ms. Ghansam said.“I told him, ‘We can’t lift five pounds between us.’ ” she said. “ ‘How are we going to move?’ ”The landlord gave them two months, during which time they found a cramped one-bedroom in a rundown section of Monticello, about 95 miles northwest of New York City, with the help of a $600 grant from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It was not what they were used to, and they were not accustomed to the new expenses they were saddled with.Ms. Ghansam said the couple did not know how much utilities like electricity and gas cost “because we didn’t pay them.”Though they receive food stamps and are on Medicaid, and Mr. Ghansam collects $680 a month in workers’ compensation, they live without a steady income because they are not well enough to return to work. They might never be. Their best hope is early Social Security; their applications are pending.“All this time we lived up here we never needed the government — until we got sick,” Mr. Ghansam said. “We’re barely breaking even.”“We can’t even go out and eat fast food,” Ms. Ghansam said.“It’s not good for us anyway,” she concluded with a laugh. “One thing is for sure.

That picture played in 4,366 theaters, giving it a clear edge over “New Moon.” But Summit is well on its way to outstripping the $69.6 million in ticket sales for the first “Twilight” film, which was released in November 2008. “Twilight,” which took in $191.5 million at the domestic box office during its first run, was re-released in 2,057 theaters on Thursday night, and took in $1.3 million, Summit said.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department intends to drop manslaughter and weapons charges against one of the security guards from the company formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide who were involved in deadly Baghdad shootings in September 2007, prosecutors said Friday in court documents.The shootings in Nisour Square left 17 Iraqis dead and set off inquiries that led the State Department to cancel the company’s lucrative contract to guard American diplomats in Iraq.A one-paragraph notice filed Friday said that prosecutors had asked that the case against Nicholas Slatten of Sparta, Tenn., be dropped. The government’s detailed request asking the judge to dismiss the case was filed with the court and with the defendant, but was not made public.Mr. Slatten was one of five guards who worked for Blackwater to be charged in the case. Blackwater is now Xe Services.Prosecutors filed the request on Friday in a way that allows them to file new charges against Mr. Slatten later. The case against the remaining four guards is scheduled to go to trial in February.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations criticized Iran on Friday for numerous human rights abuses in the wake of the disputed presidential election in June, including the arrests, intimidation and mass trials of members of the political opposition.A draft resolution detailing the criticism was approved by a vote of 74 to 48, with 59 countries abstaining.Although a resolution rebuking Iran for domestic oppression has been an annual event for about 15 years, the latest version expressed particular concern about the “rise in human rights violations” after the election.In Iran, the fallout from the election protests continued, with more opposition figures sentenced to prison terms. A nationwide campaign of arrests was reported by student Web sites, with the government apparently focusing on student leaders before protests expected on Dec. 7, known as Student Day.The violations listed in the United Nations’ draft resolution included the death and injury of opposition members and other citizens trying to exercise their right to freedom of expression; the use of violence and intimidation by the government-run Basij militia forces; the abuse of prisoners, including rape and torture as well as forced confessions; and severe restrictions on media coverage of the events.'"
"'09-11-21,'0','Professor Neal was among dozens of black people interviewed about their perspectives on “Precious.” Perhaps the most provocative salvo against the movie was fired by Armond White, the chief film critic of The New York Press and the chairman of the New York Film Critics Circle.“Not since ‘The Birth of a Nation’ has a mainstream movie demeaned the idea of black American life as much as ‘Precious,’ ” Mr. White wrote in his review. “Full of brazenly racist clichés (Precious steals and eats an entire bucket of fried chicken), it is a sociological horror show.”“Black pathology sells,” Mr. White said in an interview. “It’s an over-the-top political fantasy that works only because it demeans blacks, women and poor people.”Mainstream news media and serious critics ignored recent black-theme films like “Cadillac Records” and “Akeelah and the Bee” because they were not negative enough, he added.But Latoya Peterson, the editor of Racialicious.com, a blog about the intersection of race and popular culture, said Mr. White was off base.“His review buys into the narrative that there can only be one acceptable presentation of black life,” Ms. Peterson said. “He’s flattening the black experience, and in that way, he denies our humanity.”Ms. Peterson, who lives in the Washington area, said that she believed that “Precious” effectively tackled many issues affecting young girls: “sexual abuse, poverty, violence and failing schools.”Luvon Roberson, a public relations specialist in Manhattan, said that some of her friends had told her that “Precious” was a cascade of stereotypes, but that she found it a “deeply moving” way to show the beauty and innocence of a poor, fat, dark-skinned woman.“At the end of the film, Precious looked angelic to me,” Ms. Roberson said.Aymar Jean Christian, a doctoral student in communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said he found “Precious” brilliant and added, “In some ways, the debate’s not about the movie, it’s about the idea of the movie,” and black concerns about representation.On his blog, Televisual (at blog.ajchristian.org), he wrote that Precious was “by far the scariest movie for anyone invested in having only ‘good’ representations of black people (‘The Cosby Show!’) in film and TV.”In that case, “Precious” need not apply. Set in Harlem in the late 1980s, the movie focuses on Claireece Jones, a teenager known as Precious, who is sexually and emotionally abused by her enraged, foul-mouthed mother, Mary (played by the actor and comedian Mo’Nique). They rely on welfare; Precious is H.I.V.-positive; and the first of her two children (both by her father) has Down syndrome. Precious fantasizes about having a light-skinned boyfriend and about herself as a thin, white girl.Joe Drake, president of the film division at Lionsgate, the movie’s distributor, sidestepped a response to the more negative charges about the movie.“Precious has become imperative viewing and entered the cultural conversation in an organic, impassioned way,” Mr. Drake wrote in an e-mail message. “We are proud to be a part of this phenomenon.”Sapphire, the author of “Push,” said it was too late in the day to worry that the film’s themes and images were somehow stigmatizing or inauthentic.“With Michelle, Sasha and Malia and Obama in the White House and in the post-‘Cosby Show’ era, people can’t say these are the only images out there,” Sapphire said. “Black people are able to say ‘Precious’ represents some of our children, but some of our children go to Yale.”“Child abuse is not black,” she added. “What do you call the man in Austria who imprisoned his daughter for years?”She defended her title character as a positive “Oliver Twist-like” figure, who grew out of the stories of the young people she met in New York in the late 1980s, when crack and AIDS emerged.“Push,” which was controversial when it was published in 1996, is also back at the top of best-seller lists.“Precious” puts a much-needed spotlight on the underclass, said Nathan McCall, a novelist and former newspaper reporter who teaches a course on the history of African-American images at Emory University. But, he added, Lee Daniels, the film’s director, could have avoided some stereotypes by not making light-complexioned actors the good guys or showing Precious eating a bucket of chicken, he said.“A white artist can make a film about a family of 10 drug addicts, and the public sees it as a film about a family of 10 drug addicts, not 10 white drug addicts,” Mr. McCall said. “A black artist can make that film, too, but you have to be aware of the history.”'"

"'09-11-22,'0','“We’re playing to win the football game,” Williams said afterward. “We thought it was worth 22 yards, and we came up 5 yards short. Our whole idea was to keep our foot on the pedal and not play scared.”Williams was crestfallen, a stark contrast to the Harvard players, who were mobbed by their fans among the Yale Bowl crowd of 52,692. They later put on bright pink leis, courtesy of Takamura, a native of Honolulu.The Yale senior Larry Abare, a ferocious safety, played with a cast that covered almost his entire right arm, including his hand. He broke the arm Oct. 17 in a 7-0 victory against Lehigh. Yale lost three of its next four games, and Abare received medical clearance on Monday to play against Harvard.“It’s something I definitely was going to do,” Abare said.But Williams became the focal point.Harvard scored on its previous possession, when Winters hit Matt Luft for a 41-yard touchdown with 6:46 left.The Crimson used its final timeout during Yale’s ensuing possession. Yale led, 10-7, and Williams did not want to give the ball back to Harvard. So Yale ran a variation on a fake-punt play the Crimson had never seen. It included a lateral from Rice to Powers, but defensive back Anthony Spadafino dragged Powers down at the Yale 40 with less than three minutes remaining.“You’re a genius if that play works,” Harvard Coach Tim Murphy said. “If you don’t, you know the deal.”Yale punter Tom Mante averaged 51.3 yards on three punts Saturday, including a soaring 69-yard kick that wowed the Bulldogs’ fans. And the Yale defense stuffed the Crimson on a goal-line stand midway through the third quarter.But Harvard seemed to get on track after a slow start. Two plays before Luft scored Harvard’s first touchdown, running back Gino Gordon broke a tackle at the line of scrimmage on fourth-and-4 and rambled for 19 yards.“We were moving the ball,” Winters said, “and eventually, we thought we’d get it across the goal line.”Although Luft said he ran the wrong route, he made an alteration to find open space in the middle of the field and gathered in the touchdown pass from Winters. The 6-foot-4 Lorditch later beat defensive back Adam Money for the winning score.“We were fortunate today,” said Murphy, whose team lost a chance to tie for the Ivy League title when Penn (8-2, 7-0) beat Cornell in its season finale, 34-0. “But you do get a little bit more fortunate if you play hard all the time.”Murphy said his team was outplayed and outcoached by Yale in the first half, when the Bulldogs took a 10-0 lead.Williams ended up as the coach who had to defend his decision-making, not unlike New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick last week. The Patriots failed to convert on fourth-and-2 with a 6-point lead and a little more than two minutes remaining, and they lost to Indianapolis.Williams addressed the fake-punt play before anyone even asked.“I was trying to keep momentum on the blue side,” he said with a weak smile.'"
"'09-11-22,'0','The most penetrating and iconoclastic response to this sort of reasoning came from the writer Isaac Bashevis Singer in his story “The Letter Writer,” in which he called the slaughter of animals the “eternal Treblinka.”The story depicts an encounter between a man and a mouse. The man, Herman Gombiner, contemplates his place in the cosmic scheme of things and concludes that there is an essential connection between his own existence as “a child of God” and the “holy creature” scuffling about on the floor in front of him.Surely, he reflects, the mouse has some capacity for thought; Gombiner even thinks that the mouse has the capacity to share love and gratitude with him. Not merely a means for the satisfaction of human desires, nor a mere nuisance to be exterminated, this tiny creature possesses the same dignity that any conscious being possesses. In the face of that inherent dignity, Gombiner concludes, the human practice of delivering animals to the table in the form of food is abhorrent and inexcusable.Many of the people who denounce the ways in which we treat animals in the course of raising them for human consumption never stop to think about this profound contradiction. Instead, they make impassioned calls for more “humanely” raised meat. Many people soothe their consciences by purchasing only free-range fowl and eggs, blissfully ignorant that “free range” has very little if any practical significance. Chickens may be labeled free-range even if they’ve never been outside or seen a speck of daylight in their entire lives. And that Thanksgiving turkey? Even if it is raised “free range,” it still lives a life of pain and confinement that ends with the butcher’s knife.How can intelligent people who purport to be deeply concerned with animal welfare and respectful of life turn a blind eye to such practices? And how can people continue to eat meat when they become aware that nearly 53 billion land animals are slaughtered every year for human consumption? The simple answer is that most people just don’t care about the lives or fortunes of animals. If they did care, they would learn as much as possible about the ways in which our society systematically abuses animals, and they would make what is at once a very simple and a very difficult choice: to forswear the consumption of animal products of all kinds.The easy part of this consists in seeing clearly what ethics requires and then just plain doing it. The difficult part: You just haven’t lived until you’ve tried to function as a strict vegan in a meat-crazed society.What were once the most straightforward activities become a constant ordeal. You might think that it’s as simple as just removing meat, eggs and dairy products from your diet, but it goes a lot deeper than that.To be a really strict vegan is to strive to avoid all animal products, and this includes materials like leather, silk and wool, as well as a panoply of cosmetics and medications. The more you dig, the more you learn about products you would never stop to think might contain or involve animal products in their production — like wine and beer (isinglass, a kind of gelatin derived from fish bladders, is often used to “fine,” or purify, these beverages), refined sugar (bone char is sometimes used to bleach it) or Band-Aids (animal products in the adhesive). Just last week I was told that those little comfort strips on most razor blades contain animal fat.To go down this road is to stare headlong into an abyss that, to paraphrase Nietzsche, will ultimately stare back at you.The challenges faced by a vegan don’t end with the nuts and bolts of material existence. You face quite a few social difficulties as well, perhaps the chief one being how one should feel about spending time with people who are not vegans.Is it O.K. to eat dinner with people who are eating meat? What do you say when a dining companion says, “I’m really a vegetarian — I don’t eat red meat at home.” (I’ve heard it lots of times, always without any prompting from me.) What do you do when someone starts to grill you (so to speak) about your vegan ethics during dinner? (Wise vegans always defer until food isn’t around.) Or when someone starts to lodge accusations to the effect that you consider yourself morally superior to others, or that it is ridiculous to worry so much about animals when there is so much human suffering in the world? (Smile politely and ask them to pass the seitan.)Let me be candid: By and large, meat-eaters are a self-righteous bunch. The number of vegans I know personally is ... five. And I have been a vegan for almost 15 years, having been a vegetarian for almost 15 before that.Five. I have lost more friends than this over arguments about animal ethics. One lapidary conclusion to be drawn here is that people take deadly seriously the prerogative to use animals as sources of satisfaction. Not only for food, but as beasts of burden, as raw materials and as sources of captive entertainment — which is the way animals are used in zoos, circuses and the like.These uses of animals are so institutionalized, so normalized, in our society that it is difficult to find the critical distance needed to see them as the horrors that they are: so many forms of subjection, servitude and — in the case of killing animals for human consumption and other purposes — outright murder.People who are ethical vegans believe that differences in intelligence between human and non-human animals have no moral significance whatsoever. The fact that my cat can’t appreciate Schubert’s late symphonies and can’t perform syllogistic logic does not mean that I am entitled to use him as an organic toy, as if I were somehow not only morally superior to him but virtually entitled to treat him as a commodity with minuscule market value.We have been trained by a history of thinking of which we are scarcely aware to view non-human animals as resources we are entitled to employ in whatever ways we see fit in order to satisfy our needs and desires. Yes, there are animal welfare laws. But these laws have been formulated by, and are enforced by, people who proceed from the proposition that animals are fundamentally inferior to human beings. At best, these laws make living conditions for animals marginally better than they would be otherwise — right up to the point when we send them to the slaughterhouse.Think about that when you’re picking out your free-range turkey, which has absolutely nothing to be thankful for on Thanksgiving. All it ever had was a short and miserable life, thanks to us intelligent, compassionate humans.'"
"'09-11-22,'0','The survey found that more American households had air conditioners and microwave ovens than computers. Since 1998, the share of households with a personal computer increased to 67 percent, from 42 percent. The poor, the elderly and people without a high school diploma were least likely to own one.Ninety percent had land-line telephones (down from 96 percent in 1998), and 71 percent had cellphones (up from 36 percent). Among households headed by people under age 30, more had cellphones (81 percent) than landlines (71 percent).Since the survey was conducted well before the recession started in 2007, presumably many measures of economic well-being have since gotten worse. Still, 9 percent of households over all and more than 25 percent of those below the poverty line could not afford nutritionally adequate food without resorting to food pantries or other emergency supplies or to scavenging.Compared with the 1990s, people over all said they were more likely to expect help if they needed it from family, friends, social services agencies or religious institutions. Black and Hispanic respondents, though, were a little less likely to expect such help; blacks were a little more likely to have received it.Generally, people surveyed were more likely than in the 1990s to say they were satisfied with the safety and overall condition of their neighborhoods. Still, in 2005, 20 percent of blacks said they stayed at home because they were concerned about their safety, and 32 percent of blacks said they were afraid to walk alone at night.Because respondents were not asked to elaborate, some of the results seemed anomalous. Almost the same proportion of householders lacking medical insurance said they were as satisfied with health services as those who were insured.'"
"'09-11-22,'0','I’m one of nine sisters. My parents were dairy farmers in Wisconsin. My father didn’t believe in girls doing farm work. Girls did housework, and he hired young men to do farm work. I would have preferred to be outside.When I was 9, we moved to Osseo, Wis., where we owned a couple of hundred acres. My father was well respected in town. Years later, people would come up to me and say, “Wally was always worrying about the schools and the community.”I became pregnant by my first love at 17 and did what my parents thought was the right thing. I married him. My first husband and I moved to Janesville, Wis., where he worked in a Chrysler plant. I went to work on the assembly line of Parker Pen.I knew I didn’t want to work in a factory and three months later got a job selling new construction. It didn’t require a real estate license. But I started studying to get my broker’s license. I knew I had to find a way to support myself alone. I never had any doubt I could raise my son. I filed for divorce a week after I was 21.Soon a man named Ken Hendricks, whom I had never met, called me on the phone trying to arrange a blind date for me with one of his friends. His friend had told him about me, and he called me every night for three weeks. We talked about ourselves, but not about his friend. He said, “I really want to meet you.” By the time he walked up to my front door, I felt I had always known him.He was a roofing contractor, and we started doing business together within weeks. Within three years we had bought about 100 homes in the Beloit area. About 10 were single-family homes. The rest were two- to four-unit apartments. At the time, we could buy a three-bedroom home for $10,000 and fix it up. We did most of the work on the homes ourselves, with the help of Ken’s father. I painted about 200 units myself. We married in 1975.'"
"'09-11-22,'0','“You know, I feel really good about things,” Martin said. “And I’ve had the time of my life. I’m in the best frame of mind that I have been since I’ve been an adult.”If Johnson wrecks and somehow finishes last, Martin would need to finish seventh or better to win his first championship. Two weeks ago, at Texas Motor Speedway, Johnson tangled with Sam Hornish three laps into the race, crashed and limped to a 38th-place finish. Anything can happen.But consider this: Johnson has finished 25th or lower in only 2 of 39 Chase races over the last four years. The second time was at Texas Motor Speedway. The first was the season finale last year at Homestead, in which Johnson needed to finish 36th to win his third title. (He was 30th.) He has never won at Homestead, but he has posted an average finish of 13th place. Johnson will not be a slowpoke Sunday.Martin, 5 feet 6 inches and 125 pounds, is known as Mr. Clean because he is a skillful driver who does not bang fenders to make a pass. Chances are extremely remote that he would knock Johnson into the wall for an opportunity to win the title, even if Johnson were not his teammate. Martin has said he did not enjoy racing when he was caught up in winning a title.“The reason I took this deal is because I got close to winning a race or two in 2008,” Martin said at another news conference Thursday, “and I could just taste it. I really wanted a chance to try to win again before I wasn’t able to ever experience that again. That was the motivation for me, taking this opportunity.”He added: “One of my biggest goals coming into this year was just to be considered a good teammate, to make a contribution to Hendrick Motorsports so that when the season was over, everyone involved would be glad that I, you know, was a part of the organization.”After winning 4 of 298 races from 2000 to 2008, Martin won 5 of 35 races this year, second only to Johnson’s seven victories. Martin has finished on the lead lap in every Chase race this year except at Talladega, where he wrecked on the next-to-last lap, effectively ending his title run.Johnson made news Friday at Homestead, when the team owner Rick Hendrick announced that he had given Johnson a contract extension through 2015. Lowe’s, Johnson’s sponsor, was signed through 2013. Hendrick said he would also like to sign Chad Knaus, Johnson’s crew chief, to an extension.“We’ve said this a million times: usually, good organizations split up from the inside; they don’t get broken down from the outside,” Hendrick said. “We’re doing everything we can to make our deal nice and tight so we can be competitive for years to come.”So Johnson is not going away. But neither are his teammates, Martin and Jeff Gordon, a four-time series champion who stands to finish third this year and is likely to drive for another four or five years. To win a fifth title, Johnson will probably have to go through Martin and Gordon, again. Everyone else is just catching up.'"
"'09-11-22,'0','As the Democrats succeeded Saturday in uniting their caucus by winning over the last two holdouts, big disagreements remained, making final approval of the bill far from certain.Two reluctant Democratic senators, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, warned that their support for a motion to open debate did not guarantee that they would ultimately vote for the bill. Their remarks echoed previous comments by several other senators, including Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.Those comments made clear that more horse-trading lies ahead and that major changes might be required if the bill is to be approved. And it suggested that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who relied only on members aligned with his party to bring the bill to the floor, may yet have to sway one or more Republicans to his side to get the bill adopted.The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said his party’s opposition would persist. “The battle has just begun,” he said.In a rare ceremonial gesture reserved for major votes, senators cast their yeas and nays from their desks in the chamber, each one rising to voice his or her position. Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, was not present and did not vote.After the vote, Mr. Reid said he understood that Ms. Landrieu was already working with two other Democratic senators, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Charles E. Schumer of New York, to see if they could devise a public insurance plan with broad appeal.The White House issued a statement praising the vote. “The President is gratified that the Senate has acted to begin consideration of health insurance reform legislation,” his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, adding that President Obama “looks forward to a thorough and productive debate.”Mrs. Lincoln, who faces a tough re-election campaign next year and has in recent weeks been the target of millions of dollars in television advertising by both sides in the health care fight, said pointedly that she would not vote for the measure if it retained a government-run health insurance plan, known as the public option, to compete with private insurers. “Although I don’t agree with everything in this bill, I believe it is more important that we begin debate on how to improve the health care system for all Americans,” said Mrs. Lincoln, who was the last uncommitted Democrat, and whose speech, at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday, lifted a cloud of suspense that had hovered around the Capitol.She added: “But let me be perfectly clear. I am opposed to a new government-administered health care plan as a part of comprehensive health insurance reform, and I will not vote in favor of the proposal that has been introduced by leader Reid as it is written.” But Senator Lieberman, who voted to take up the health care bill, said he was still staunchly opposed to a government-run plan. It is “a terrible idea,” he said.Ms. Landrieu, whose support came after she won a provision that could be worth more than $100 million in additional federal aid for her financially troubled state, said, “I have decided there are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward, but much more work needs to be done.”A parade of Democrats and Republicans spent Saturday laying out their arguments for and against the bill in floor speeches.Mr. Reid, in a rousing closing speech given at his customary volume, which is barely audible, likened the health care bill to some of the most profound issues confronted by the Senate across history.“Imagine if instead of debating either of the historic G.I. Bills — legislation that has given so many brave Americans the chance to brave college — if this body had stood silent,” Mr. Reid said. “Imagine if instead of debating the bills that created Social Security or Medicare, the Senate’s voices had been stilled. Imagine if instead of debating whether to abolish slavery, instead of debating whether giving women and minorities a right to vote, those who disagreed were muted, discussion was killed.”With the Democrats nominally controlling 60 votes — the precise number needed to overcome the Republican attempt to stop the bill — the vote on Saturday evening was the biggest test yet of the Democrats’ resolve and of Mr. Reid’s ability to unite his fragile caucus. Mr. Reid faces a tough re-election fight next year.The bill would expand health benefits by broadly expanding Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income people, and by providing subsidies to help moderate-income people buy either private insurance or coverage under a new government-run plan, the public option. And it would impose a requirement that nearly all Americans obtain insurance or pay monetary penalties for failing to do so.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of the legislation would be more than offset by new taxes and fees and reductions in government spending, so that the bill would reduce future federal budget deficits by $130 billion through 2019.Mr. Reid accused Republicans who opposed the legislation of “living in a different world.” He and several other Democrats also used their speeches to assail perceived abuses by private insurers. “The health insurance industry has an insatiable appetite for more profit,” Mr. Reid said.Senate Republicans countered with an impassioned denunciation of the measure as an ill-conceived budget-busting expansion of government and a threat to the health and economic security of all Americans, especially the elderly.The Republicans sought to portray the vote on Saturday — on whether to end debate on a motion to bring up the health bill — as tantamount to a vote on the bill itself, and to shake the confidence of Democrats who had wavered in recent days.In his closing argument, just ahead of the vote, Mr. McConnell implored at least a single Democrat to vote no. “If we don’t stop this bill tonight,” he said, “the only debate we’ll be having is about higher premiums, not savings for the American people, higher taxes instead of lower costs, and cuts to Medicare rather than improving seniors’ care.”“The American people are looking at the Senate tonight; they’re hoping we say no to this bill,” Mr. McConnell added moments later, holding up a single index finger. “All it would take,” he said, “is just one member of the other side of the aisle, just one, to give us an opportunity not to end the debate but to change the debate in the direction the American people would like us to go.”Mr. McConnell warned of the political consequences for senators who voted to move ahead. “Senators who support this bill have a lot of explaining to do,” he said. “Americans know that a vote to proceed on this bill, to get on this bill, is a vote for higher premiums, higher taxes and massive cuts to Medicare.”Republicans also said that the vote was a proxy for a larger dispute over abortion, because they said the bill did not sufficiently restrict the use of federal money for insurance covering abortions. Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, described the vote as “the key vote on abortion in the health care debate.”Saturday night’s vote was required because Senate rules and precedent have long granted a right of virtually unlimited debate, or filibuster, to the minority that can be curtailed only by a supermajority vote of 60 senators to move ahead. Currently, there are 58 Democrats in the Senate and two independents who routinely align with them. If the Democrats had lost the vote, they could have tried again, presumably after changing the bill to try to attract more votes.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont assailed the Republicans as obstructionists on Saturday morning. “I will vote today to end the filibuster so the Senate can begin the historic debate to improve and reform our nation’s health insurance system,” he said. “Let’s not duck the debate, let the debate begin. Let’s not hide from the votes.”While Democrats generally agree on the broad goals of the legislation, to cover the uninsured and to slow the growth in health care spending, there are potentially serious disagreements over any number of provisions that could sink the bill.Ms. Landrieu, in her speech, methodically cataloged provisions of the bill that she liked and those that she said needed improvement.Under the bill, she said, owners of small businesses would no longer face “volatile costs” for health insurance. In addition, she said, the bill would “encourage employers to move away from high-cost benefit plans” and shift some compensation to wages.But more needed to be done to improve the bill, she argued, particularly to help small businesses and the self-employed. And she issued a stern warning about the public option, one of the most contentious features of the sweeping health care legislation.'"

"'09-11-22,'0','I glance at the bedside clock. Seven thirty. Stefanie let me sleep in. The fatigue of these final days has been severe. Apart from the physical strain, there is the exhausting torrent of emotions set loose by my pending retirement. Now, rising from the center of the fatigue comes the first wave of pain. I grab my back. It grabs me. I feel as if someone snuck in during the night and attached one of those anti-theft steering wheel locks to my spine. How can I play in the U.S. Open with the Club on my spine? Will the last match of my career be a forfeit?I was born with spondylolisthesis, meaning a bottom vertebra that parted from the other vertebrae, struck out on its own, rebelled. (It's the main reason for my pigeon-toed walk.) With this one vertebra out of sync, there's less room for the nerves inside the column of my spine, and with the slightest movement the nerves feel that much more crowded. Throw in two herniated discs and a bone that won't stop growing in a futile effort to protect the damaged area, and those nerves start to feel downright claustrophobic. When the nerves protest their cramped quarters, when they send out distress signals, a pain runs up and down my leg that makes me suck in my breath and speak in tongues. At such moments the only relief is to lie down and wait. Sometimes, however, the moment arrives in the middle of a match. Then the only remedy is to alter my game — swing differently, run differently, do everything differently. That's when my muscles spasm. Everyone avoids change; muscles can't abide it. Told to change, my muscles join the spinal rebellion, and soon my whole body is at war with itself.Gil, my trainer, my friend, my surrogate father, explains it this way: Your body is saying it doesn't want to do this anymore.My body has been saying that for a long time, I tell Gil. Almost as long as I've been saying it.Since January, however, my body has been shouting it. My body doesn't want to retire — my body has already retired. My body has moved to Florida and bought a condo and white Sansabelts. So I've been negotiating with my body, asking it to come out of retirement for a few hours here, a few hours there. Much of this negotiation revolves around a cortisone shot that temporarily dulls the pain. Before the shot works, however, it causes its own torments.I got one yesterday, so I could play tonight. It was the third shot this year, the thirteenth of my career, and by far the most alarming. The doctor, not my regular doctor, told me brusquely to assume the position. I stretched out on his table, face down, and his nurse yanked down my shorts. The doctor said he needed to get his seven-inch needle as close to the inflamed nerves as possible. But he couldn't enter directly, because my herniated discs and bone spur were blocking the path. His attempts to circumvent them, to break the Club, sent me through the roof. First he inserted the needle. Then he positioned a big machine over my back to see how close the needle was to the nerves. He needed to get that needle almost flush against the nerves, he said, without actually touching. If it were to touch the nerves, even if it were to only nick the nerves, the pain would ruin me for the tournament. It could also be life-changing. In and out and around, he maneuvered the needle, until my eyes filled with water.Finally he hit the spot. Bull's-eye, he said.In went the cortisone. The burning sensation made me bite my lip. Then came the pressure. I felt infused, embalmed. The tiny space in my spine where the nerves are housed began to feel vacuum packed. The pressure built until I thought my back would burst.Pressure is how you know everything's working, the doctor said.Soon the pain felt wonderful, almost sweet, because it was the kind that you can tell precedes relief. But maybe all pain is like that.My family is growing louder. I limp out to the living room of our suite. My son, Jaden, and my daughter, Jaz, see me and scream. Daddy, Daddy! They jump up and down and want to leap on me. I stop and brace myself, stand before them like a mime imitating a tree in winter. They stop just before leaping, because they know Daddy is delicate these days, Daddy will shatter if they touch him too hard. I pat their faces and kiss their cheeks and join them at the breakfast table.Jaden asks if today is the day.And then after today are you retire?A new word he and his younger sister have learned. Retired. When they say it, they always leave off the last letter. For them it's retire, forever ongoing, permanently in the present tense. Maybe they know something I don't.Not if I win, son. If I win tonight, I keep playing.But if you lose — we can have a dog?To the children, retire equals puppy. Stefanie and I have promised them that when I stop training, when we stop traveling the world, we can buy a puppy. Maybe we'll name him Cortisone.Yes, buddy, when I lose, we will buy a dog.He smiles. He hopes Daddy loses, hopes Daddy experiences the disappointment that surpasses all others. He doesn't understand — and how will I ever be able to explain it to him? — the pain of losing, the pain of playing. It's taken me nearly thirty years to understand it myself, to solve the calculus of my own psyche.I ask Jaden what he's doing today.Going to see the bones.I look at Stefanie. She reminds me she's taking them to the Museum of Natural History. Dinosaurs. I think of my twisted vertebrae. I think of my skeleton on display at the museum with all the other dinosaurs. Tennis-aurus Rex.Jaz interrupts my thoughts. She hands me her muffin. She needs me to pick out the blueberries before she eats it. Our morning ritual. Each blueberry must be surgically removed, which requires precision, concentration. Stick the knife in, move it around, get it right up to the blueberry without touching. I focus on her muffin and it's a relief to think about something other than tennis. But as I hand her the muffin, I can't pretend that it doesn't feel like a tennis ball, which makes the muscles in my back twitch with anticipation. The time is drawing near.After breakfast, after Stefanie and the kids have kissed me goodbye and run off to the museum, I sit quietly at the table, looking around the suite. It's like every hotel suite I've ever had, only more so. Clean, chic, comfortable — it's the Four Seasons, so it's lovely, but it's still just another version of what I call Not Home. The non-place we exist as athletes. I close my eyes, try to think about tonight, but my mind drifts backward. My mind these days has a natural backspin. Given half a chance it wantsto return to the beginning, because I'm so close to the end. But I can't let it. Not yet. I can't afford to dwell too long on the past. I get up and walk around the table, test my balance. When I feel fairly steady I walk gingerly to the shower.Under the hot water I groan and scream. I bend slowly, touch my quads, start to come alive. My muscles loosen. My skin sings. My pores fly open. Warm blood goes sluicing through my veins. I feel something begin to stir. Life. Hope. The last drops of youth. Still, I make no sudden movements. I don't want to do anything to startle my spine. I let my spine sleep in.Standing at the bathroom mirror, toweling off, I stare at my face. Red eyes, gray stubble — a face totally different from the one with which I started. But also different from the one I saw last year in this same mirror. Whoever I might be, I'm not the boy who started this odyssey, and I'm not even the man who announced three months ago that the odyssey was coming to an end. I'm like a tennis racket on which I've replaced the grip four times and the strings seven times — is it accurate to call it the same racket? Somewhere in those eyes, however, I can still vaguely see the boy who didn't want to play tennis in the first place, the boy who wanted to quit, the boy who did quit many times. I see that golden-haired boy who hated tennis, and I wonder how he would view this bald man, who still hates tennis and yet still plays. Would he be shocked? Amused? Proud? The question makes me weary, lethargic, and it's only noon.Please let this be over.I'm not ready for it to be over.The finish line at the end of a career is no different from the finish line at the end of a match. The objective is to get within reach of that finish line, because then it gives off a magnetic force. When you're close, you can feel that force pulling you, and you can use that force to get across. But just before you come within range, or just after, you feel another force, equally strong, pushing you away. It's inexplicable, mystical, these twin forces, these contradictory energies, but they both exist. I know, because I've spent much of my life seeking the one, fighting the other, and sometimes I've been stuck, suspended, bounced like a tennis ballbetween the two.Tonight: I remind myself that it will require iron discipline to cope with these forces, and whatever else comes my way. Back pain, bad shots, foul weather, self-loathing. It's a form of worry, this reminder, but also a meditation. One thing I've learned in twenty-nine years of playing tennis: Life will throw everything but the kitchen sink in your path, and then it will throw the kitchen sink. It's your job to avoid the obstacles. If you let them stop you or distract you, you're not doing your job, and failing to do your job will cause regrets that paralyze you more than a bad back.I lie on the bed with a glass of water and read. When my eyes get tired I click on the TV. Tonight, Round Two of the U.S. Open! Will this be Andre Agassi's farewell? My face flashes on the screen. A different face than the one in the mirror. My game face. I study this new reflection of me in the distorted mirror that is TV and my anxiety rises another click or two.Was that the final commercial? The final time CBS will ever promote one of my matches?I can't escape the feeling that I'm about to die.It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.But if tennis is life, then what follows tennis must be the unknowable void. The thought makes me cold.Stefanie bursts through the door with the kids. They flop on the bed, and my son asks how I'm feeling.Fine, fine. How were the bones?Stefanie gives them sandwiches and juice and hustles them out the door again.They have a playdate, she says.Now I can take a nap. At thirty-six, the only way I can play a late match, which could go past midnight, is if I get a nap beforehand. Also, now that I know roughly who I am, I want to close my eyes and hide from it. When I open my eyes, one hour has passed. I say aloud, It's time. No more hiding. I step into the shower again, but this shower is different from the morning shower. The afternoon shower is always longer — twenty-two minutes, give or take — and it's not for waking up or getting clean. The afternoon shower is for encouraging myself, coaching myself.Tennis is the sport in which you talk to yourself. No athletes talk to themselves like tennis players. Pitchers, golfers, goalkeepers, they mutter to themselves, of course, but tennis players talk to themselves — and answer. In the heat of a match, tennis players look like lunatics in a public square, ranting and swearing and conducting Lincoln-Douglas debates with their alter egos. Why? Because tennis is so damned lonely. Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players — and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement, which inevitably leads to self-talk, and for me the self-talk starts here in the afternoon shower. This is when I begin to say things to myself, crazy things, over and over, until I believe them. For instance, that a quasi-cripple can compete at the U.S. Open. That a thirty-six-year-old man can beat an opponent just entering his prime. I've won 869 matches in my career, fifth on the all-time list, and many were won during the afternoon shower.With the water roaring in my ears — a sound not unlike twenty thousand fans — I recall particular wins. Not wins the fans would remember, but wins that still wake me at night. Squillari in Paris. Blake in New York. Pete in Australia. Then I recall a few losses. I shake my head at the disappointments.

"'09-11-22,'0','Indeed, Mr. Millan’s advice has replaced a shelf full of books on how to tame an unruly child. “It’s all the same simple concept: how to be the pack leader in your own house,” she said.Certainly, an army, or at least a few divisions, of credentialed experts on human parenthood long ago stumbled on Mr. Millan’s philosophical holy trinity — exercise, discipline and affection equals happiness. And Mr. Millan does not hold himself up as a new Dr. Spock; he has never opined on how one should raise a creature with two legs in his show on the National Geographic Channel, or in his four books.But some parents — particularly those weary of never-say-no techniques and child-rearing books suggesting that children should call the shots — say they find inspiration, and even practical advice, in Mr. Millan’s approach, which teaches pet owners how to become the alpha dogs by projecting his trademark “calm-assertive energy.”DaddyCast, a series of podcasts published online by a father of two who identifies himself only as P.D., devoted an episode last year to discussing how he applied Dog Whisperer philosophies to raising children. In the episode, he recalled exchanging Twitter messages with a father who wrote: “Pampering and never punishing will make a child crazy and unlikable, never self-competent.”“That goes along with the philosophy of the Dog Whisperer,” the host added. Brenna Hicks, a child therapist in Palm Harbor, Fla., who writes an advice blog, The Kid Counselor, adapted Mr. Millan’s central idea, that dogs take their cues from their masters, and misbehave only when the masters fail to carry themselves, in body language and tone of voice, like pack leaders. In a post, “Raising Kids: Wisdom From the Dog Whisperer,” she wrote, “When we present nervous, angry or scared energy in front of our kids, they pick up on those emotions.”Allison Pearson, author of the novel “I Don’t Know How She Does It,” which explored the stresses of modern motherhood, explained how parents would naturally envy the authority of dog trainers. “My generation got itself in a muddle about parenting,” she wrote by e-mail. “We thought that obedience was the enemy of love. We didn’t want the kids to be afraid of us, but after a while we found ourselves wondering: do we have to do what they say the whole time?”“Unlike modern parents,” she added, “dog trainers don’t think discipline equals being mean. They understand that dogs are happiest when they know their position in the hierarchy.”So is it “spare the rolled-up newspaper, spoil the child?” Not exactly. Many Dog Whisperer techniques — say, the push on the neck to get a dog’s attention — are best left to the kennel, unless you welcome a visit from Child Protective Services.But other measures may yield an obedient child. Matthew Hranek, a photographer in New York, has a daughter, Clara, who is 6, and a Patterdale terrier, Charlie, who is a handful. Lately, Mr. Hranek said, he finds himself adopting Mr. Millan’s trademark “sshht!” sound — meant to snap dogs out of unconstructive patterns of thought or behavior — not just when Charlie jumps up on the kitchen counter, but also when Clara does. A bit of a joke? Sure. But it’s efficient. With none of the usual red-in-the-face parental haranguing, it reminds her who is boss in a syllable.Mr. Hranek said that some parents he knows “do not allow the word ‘no’ to be said around the house. How absurd is that?”“When you’re wishy-washy with dogs, they take advantage — ‘He didn’t mean don’t eat that biscuit,’ ” Mr. Hranek said. “Kids think the same way.”In that spirit, Jenny Hope, a television producer in Los Angeles, not connected to the Millan show, applies Dog Whisperer lessons not just to the family dog, Heidi, but also to her son, Rowan, 3. On the show, she said, Mr. Millan lets the dogs know that he decides when they can run off to sniff a juniper bush, and when to heel.When Ms. Hope’s husband, Simon Cote, recently installed a sprinkler system in the backyard, Rowan wanted to play in the mud. She relented. Fun is crucial, after all. But so is an end to the fun. She let him make his resplendent mess, then brought him in after a set period of time.“It’s finite, and it’s what they crave,” Ms. Hope explained. “Children love structure, the same as animals love structure.”Mr. Millan says parents question him all the time. “I’m going to give them my point of view — I’m a father myself,” he said.As a native of Mexico, he said, he adheres to a more traditional, hierarchical child-rearing philosophy, which he considers effective in both the pack and the family. There, “for thousands of years, the elder has always been the pack leader, it’s never the child,” Mr. Millan said. “In America, kids have too many options when they only need one: ‘Just do it, because.’ ”To some parents, however, moving Dog Whisperer theories into the human realm is not so much about changing their child’s attitude as it is about changing their own.Take Elizabeth Meyer, in Columbus Township, Mich. She and her husband adopted a strong-willed 2-year-old boy from South Korea last year.“Given that all of us were still adjusting, bonding and getting to know one another, there were times when my husband and I really struggled with parenting,” she wrote in an e-mail message.Then one night she was watching the Dog Whisperer. Squaring off against a particularly difficult dog, he took its intransigence as an opportunity to teach proper behavior. “This is good,” he said.For Ms. Meyer, it was a moment of epiphany.“This is good?” she wrote. “Did I have that attitude as a parent? Was I focusing on the positives, the opportunities? Did I remember to take a deep breath, to be calm and assertive when dealing with a frustrating situation? I realized this was something I really needed to work on. And once I did, I saw a difference right away. Our son was calmer and more responsive. During those times when he did act up, being calm and assertive helped me deal with the misbehavior in a positive way.”It also, she added, “left me feeling a lot less stressed out.”'"
"'09-11-22,'0','IT was nearly midnight in an upscale Atlanta hotel room, and Robin Williams was decompressing after a show at the nearby Fox Theater. Reclining in his dimly lighted suite, he was weary but in good spirits; the mechanical key hidden in his back was winding down, and the flow of free associations and zany voices that relentlessly emanates from him was slowing to a trickle.Mr. Williams, 58, had been picking apart the 90-minute stand-up set he had finished, but his thoughts drifted back to a subsequent meet-and-greet with V.I.P. audience members. There, among the fans who had paid extra to shake his hand, get his autograph and tell him they were glad to see he was still alive, one woman had said his comedy had helped her beat cancer.Asked why he still commanded such devotion from his audience after a three-year period in which he has contended with alcohol dependency, divorce and heart surgery, Mr. Williams sat up and let loose a loud, joyous cackle.“I know what you’re saying,” he said. “What’s my credibility? Why are they looking to me for advice? Isn’t there someone more qualified?”Amid a spate of suffering that could fill a second Book of Job, Mr. Williams has resumed his first comedy tour since 2002, the one that he had already named “Weapons of Self Destruction” before he halted it to undergo an aortic valve replacement procedure in March. Assuming he makes it through to its conclusion, his itinerary will end with a nine-night stand in New York and Atlantic City, followed by the premiere of an HBO special on Dec. 6.Needless to say, the Robin Williams who will take the stage on Monday at Town Hall in Manhattan is not the same man who hit the road in September 2008, and not only because he now has a bovine valve in his heart. He has become more introspective and more grateful for what he has. (“You appreciate little things,” he said, “like walks on the beach with a defibrillator.”)Only now that the hyper-verbal Mr. Williams finds himself in a confessional mood, he isn’t sure he knows when to stop. “How much more can you give?” he asked rhetorically. “Other than, literally, open-heart surgery onstage? Not much. But the only cure you have right now is the honesty of going, this is who you are. I know who I am.”In a career that spans more than 30 years Mr. Williams has earned a reputation as the manic motormouth of numerous stand-up shows and films like “Good Morning, Vietnam” and “Aladdin.” The frenetic brute force of his performance can be awe inspiring, even as it has kept his audience at arm’s length.“I’ve always felt that Robin’s blinding speed and flash of wit was an effort at concealment, rather than revealing,” said Eric Idle, a longtime friend. “He would be talking about something personal or sexual, but it was always in general, not about him.”Seated on a private plane headed for Jacksonville, Fla., the morning after his Atlanta show, the compact, famously hirsute Mr. Williams came across as quiet and mild mannered. He spoke softly but enthusiastically about favorite video games, Japanese manga and anime, punctuating his speech with the occasional one-liner or stray impression of Liberace or an old Jewish woman.As talk turned to his personal life, Mr. Willams made it clear he was not ashamed of discussing the subject, whether in private or onstage in front of thousands.“It would be insane not to talk about it,” he said. “‘Oh, what happened?’ ‘Nothing.’ It’s what’s happened, and everyone knows.”The image of Mr. Williams as a genial joke teller  an image cultivated by a string of shticky, sentimental movie roles  came unraveled in 2006 when he checked himself into a rehabilitation center for alcohol abuse. If the development took fans by surprise, his family members say it was the culmination of a months-long cycle of binges and confrontations.“There were times when many of us were asking questions, saying, “Hey, what the hell is going on?’ ” said Zak Williams, 26, the comedian’s son by his first wife, Valerie Velardi. (Mr. Williams also has a daughter, Zelda, and a son, Cody, from a second marriage to Marsha Garces). Zak did not go into detail on the discussions that led to his father’s rehab stint, but said only, “There was an ultimatum attached to it.” He added, “I’m pretty confident that if he continued drinking, he would not be alive today.”Mr. Williams, who kicked a cocaine habit around the time that Zak was born, said he had not fully addressed the issues underlying that addiction. “There was still, in the background, this voice, like, ‘Psst,’ ” he said, beckoning with his finger. “So when I relapsed, I went back hard. The one thing I hadn’t dealt with was, how honest do you want to live?”'"
"'09-11-22,'0','From El Paso, barreling east on I-10 for two hours past mountains of dirt, I exit at the town of Van Horn cruising past a sign that would have once been portentous, reading DIESEL FRIED CHICKEN. Off the county highway, the Chihuahuan Desert rolls out in an expanse of pale green grass to mountains floating like islands in the distance. Great tilted plateaus rise and drop off in concave cliffs, and a train of endless freight cars chugs along to the north.Nearly 12 hours after starting my journey, I pull up to the small adobe house my husband and I now own at the edge of town and meet my friend Rob Crowley who’s come to take me to a cookout at the home of a food-minded newcomer. Rocky Barnette, formerly the executive sous-chef at the Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia (and now with a nonprofit called Food & Water Watch), has raised five pigs, feeding them a local restaurant’s vegetarian food scraps. Two days earlier he’d slaughtered one in a way that sounds especially Texan: feeding it two Mexican beers before shooting it between the eyes. A tall, gregarious 30-year-old, Mr. Barnette carves the meat in the yard while two dogs watch attentively, kids sprint around a gigantic garden nearly trampling young fava beans, and women in sundresses discuss the benefit of drinking tequila straight: no hangover.Mr. Barnette ventures that he might like to open a restaurant in Marfa, “Maybe a gastropub like St. John in London, where you order drinks and take them to the table.” Not long ago, this kind of statement would have sounded delusional when eating still meant cobbling together meals from the dusty supermarket.At the weekly farmers’ market the next morning, housed under a gigantic shade pavilion downtown beside the railroad tracks, I try a savory pork asado burrito and buy a half dozen chicken tamales for later, before stocking up on tortillas, pecan brittle, bok choy, bread, yogurt and eggs, all with a vague feeling that I can’t believe my luck. Sandra Harper, who helped found the market about four years ago, points out that the shift to local food is not unprecedented: “All ranches had vegetable gardens, chickens and a milk cow until after the war. But the drought in the 1950s changed the general mind-set. Nobody thinks of this area as a growing place. It’s a big secret. The main challenge is water, but you can grow things in a backyard.”One of the best-known eating destinations in Marfa is the Food Shark, a 1974 delivery truck that these days is parked under the same farmers’ market pavilion four afternoons a week. Krista Steinhauer, the Food Shark’s chef, and Adam Bork, its “art director,” moved from Austin in 2004 to work at a hotel, but Ms. Steinhauer soon began cooking for parties, and eventually the couple bought and altered the Shark.Her daily changing menu includes items like banh mi sandwiches, beef curry over rice, slow-roasted pork tacos in ancho-cocoa rub, and brown butter cookies. “It’s determined by what I have, what I can get, and what I have from yesterday that’s left over,” she says. But the mainstay of the menu is Ms. Steinhauer’s falafel, which she describes as “desert food.” Inspired by a Syrian cook she knew in Romania, Ms. Steinhauer makes her marfalafel, bright green on the inside, with cilantro, parsley, onions and garlic, and sometimes mint, and rolls them in chickpea flour rather than wheat, which, she explains, “underscores the chickpea taste.”Later, I drop by Tacos del Norte, opened by Rosario Martinez last spring, who came from Mexico via Chicago, where she lived for 20 years before her husband found construction work in the area. Set up in the old Pik ‘n’ Pak market, with two giant Speedy Gonzales murals on the walls, it’s a three-generation operation, offering homemade tortillas and chorizo, tacos and burritos in a style definitely more Mexican than Tex-Mex. Bolstering her menu with supplies she picks up on regular visits to her hometown in Coahuila, Ms. Martinez says, “I leave the crockpots going all night and do the rest in the morning.”A few days after I’ve eaten at Cochineal — enjoying a salt-and-pepper shrimp salad over fennel and oranges in a gravel courtyard under an orange-streaked sunset — the restaurant’s owner, Tom Rapp, tells me that he and his partner, Toshifumi Sakihara, opened it last year as an extension of the “global home cooking” they did at their restaurant, Etats-Unis, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, adding, “That means the home cooking takes the pretension out of the global.” Mr. Sakihara listens from the spotless open kitchen as he makes a rhubarb pie.Mr. Rapp is pithy about the history of Marfa that’s made Cochineal viable: “In the beginning there was cattle, sheep and the railroad. Then there was Judd. Judd begat Crowley,” he says, referring to Tim Crowley, a philanthropic Houstonian central to the town’s revitalization. “Judd made Marfa a destination but did little in remaking the town. It’s in a fourth phase now that there is infrastructure, hotel space, restaurant space. It’s a solidification of what they gave.”On my way out of town, I stop about 35 miles west of Marfa, on the far side of the next (and much smaller) town of Valentine at a one-room adobe building with a sign that says Prada Marfa above a plate-glass window showcasing expensive shoes and handbags on Berber carpeting littered with dead moths. Installed by the conceptual art duo Elmgreen & Dragset in 2005, the work’s punch line seems a little pat. Then I notice the low ledge that runs along the outside of the building where small, jagged rocks anchor hundreds of calling cards lined up like train cars: Pappy’s Kettle Corn; a medical diagnostic service; the Dallas Museum of Art. I find it strangely moving — the idea of so many people passing through, wanting to prove they were here.With a menu featuring dishes like rosemary-marinated rack of lamb with mint pesto and salmon grilled on mesquite, Cochineal (107 West San Antonio Street; 432-729-3300) is set in a 100-year-old adobe building redone in a style that the owner, Tom Rapp, calls “friendly Minimalism.” The desserts, especially the baked-to-order date pudding, are excellent. Dinner for two costs about $120.Close to the heart of Marfa’s good-food movement are Maiya and Saarin Keck, sisters who each own a popular restaurant. The younger one runs Maiya’s (103 North Highland Street; 432-729-4410; www.maiyasrestaurant.com), which offers an eclectic, seasonally changing menu, delicious homemade bread and the ideal margarita in a former jewelry store. Dinner for two costs about $120. She also opened the Get Go grocery (208 South Dean Street; 432-729-3335; www.thegetgomarfa.com), selling quality foodstuffs and many local products.Started by Saarin Keck and her husband, Ronnie O’Donnell, the Pizza Foundation (100 East San Antonio Street; 432-729-3377; www.pizzafoundation.com) serves up stellar thin-crust pizza and fresh limeade in a former car dealership at the town’s main crossroads. Meal for two, $15.No need to drive 60 miles for Mexican food when you can visit Tacos del Norte (1500 West San Antonio Street; 432-729-4540). Try the sopes and beef barbacoa. A meal for two is about $15.Having just reopened after a long hiatus, Carmen’s Cafe (317 East San Antonio Street; 432-729-3429) offers cinnamon rolls at breakfast and tasty pico de gallo, enchiladas and chips at lunch. A meal for two costs about $20.Tuesday through Friday afternoons, the Food Shark (Shade Pavilion, Highland Avenue; 432-386-6540; www.foodsharkmarfa.com) cooks up its marfalafel and inspired daily specials. A lunch for two costs about $25.On Saturday mornings, starting at 10, check out Farm Stand Marfa (Shade Pavilion, Highland Avenue ) for desert honey, flaky pear tarts and spicy burritos, alongside the local produce.Open only on Sunday, the airy Austin Street Cafe (405 North Austin Street; 432-729-4653; www.austinstreetcafe.com) offers brunch with fresh fruit smoothies and Texas caviar (black-eyed peas). A meal for two, about $35.For a sense of what Marfa used to be, visit the Hotel Paisano (207 North Highland Avenue; 866-729-3669; www.hotelpaisano.com), where James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor stayed while filming “Giant.” Doubles start at $99. The Thunderbird Hotel (601 West San Antonio Street; 877-729-1984; www.thunderbirdmarfa.com) is 1950s architecture reimagined in hipster chic, with record turntables and manual typewriters available, and a gemlike pool surrounded by a fence made of ocotillo cactus. Doubles from $120. El Cosmico (Highway 67; info@elcosmico.com; www.elcosmico.com) is a work in progress at the edge of town and already has vintage trailers and campsites available. Doubles from $75.Thirty-three miles south of Marfa, Cibolo Creek Ranch (Highway 67; 866-496-9460; www.cibolocreekranch.com) will take you all the way into the Wild West and offer you skeet shooting and merlot.

"'09-11-23,'1','A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments last week about whether police should have to get a warrant before putting a GPS device on a suspect’s car. It is a cutting-edge civil liberties question that has divided the courts that have considered it. GPS devices give the government extraordinary power to monitor people’s movements. The Washington court should rule that a warrant is required.Antoine Jones was charged with being part of an interstate drug conspiracy. The government obtained evidence against Mr. Jones by putting a GPS device on his Jeep. It obtained a court order to install the GPS device, but the defense said the order was faulty, and tried to get the evidence collected by the device thrown out. The government responded that the evidence was admissible because it did not need to get a court order at all.The Supreme Court has not considered the question of whether the police need a court order to install a GPS device. The government has tried to draw an analogy to a 1983 case in which the court ruled that the police do not need a warrant to use a radio beeper to track a vehicle on public roads, but the circumstances were different. In that case, the police were conducting visual surveillance of a particular suspect’s movements, and a beeper augmented the officers’ senses. A modern GPS device is a far more potent means of tracking people than a beeper.Lower courts have reached different conclusions. A panel of the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in 2007 that a warrant is not required for remote surveillance by a GPS device, although it said that if the police began to use the technique on a large scale it might violate the Fourth Amendment.The highest courts of three states — New York, Oregon and Washington — ruled the opposite way, that their state constitutions prohibit the police from installing GPS devices without a warrant. The New York Court of Appeals, the highest New York court, got it exactly right earlier this year, insisting that permitting police to install GPS devices without judicial oversight would be “an enormous unsupervised intrusion by the police agencies of government upon personal privacy.”As technology advances, government will continue to acquire new and more efficient ways of monitoring people. It is critical that the privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment keep up with those advances.'"
"'09-11-23,'1','JPMorgan’s will be the ones to watch. The bank, run by Jamie Dimon, couldn’t agree on a price with the Treasury a few months ago and elected to have the warrants auctioned off. Rumor had it at the time that the government sought $2 billion or even more, with the bank offering far less.The risk for the Treasury, of course, is that the auction brings in less than JPMorgan had been willing to pay. But as long as Deutsche does its job and brings in plenty of would-be buyers, officials should be able to say taxpayers received a genuine market price for the warrants. The trouble with being in government is that probably won’t silence the critics.One factor in the credit debacle was the “race to the bottom” by financial regulators. Overlapping jurisdictions meant companies could switch regulators. Officials competed to attract banks by offering friendlier oversight than crosstown rivals. But in this era of reform, are regulators now racing to the top?That’s one interpretation of a rise in enforcement actions and ballyhooed initiatives by the likes of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. With legislation in Congress that could gut all or some of their regulatory authority, it’s plausible that agencies are now trying to out-regulate one another.The Fed has clamped down on overdraft fees and taken aim at gift card abuses. Fines collected by the S.E.C. have more than doubled in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation wants to tighten rules governing securitization.The Justice Department, the Treasury and the Housing and Urban Development Department are forming a joint antifraud task force. And John Dugan, head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a commercial bank watchdog, urged regulators around the world to set minimum standards for mortgage underwriting.True, rules were so sketchily enforced over the last several years that even minimally increased efforts have become noticeable. And the shift in political winds in favor of heavier regulation has encouraged bureaucrats to come up with new ideas.A compelling explanation, however, involves the threat that legislative change poses to the various agencies’ powers and budgets. The bill drafted by Senator Christopher Dodd, for example, would have the F.D.I.C. and the Fed losing parts of their current regulatory mandates.With reform in the air and survival in some cases at stake, it’s reasonable to believe the various watchdogs want to be noticed, and seen as toughening up their acts. The financial industry lobby could yet defeat even modest reform. But as long as politicians are debating their future, regulators are wise to look busy.'"
"'09-11-23,'1','“I was counting my money until September,” Mr. Hart said. “I don’t know whether I’m going to be able to farm another year or not.”In the pitch black of the night, Mr. Hart’s hired hand and a friend, Edmond Clark, who were waiting to help, informed Mr. Hart that the dew had already come. The ruined beans were too wet to harvest that night.For the thousandth time, Mr. Hart, 61, asked himself why he had come back home more than three decades ago from Chicago, where he was a lathe operator, to farm the family land where he grew up.“You just keep going,” he said, forced to live for the most part off his wife’s salary as a nurse. “She knows that’s all I like to do.”The rainy autumn has made it clear that farmers across the Delta will lose money this year. But for smaller farmers in the area like Mr. Hart, who owns or rents about 1,000 acres, and Mr. Clark, with about 600 acres, the question is whether they will be able to go on.The rain has affected farmers in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, eastern Arkansas and parts of Louisiana. Mississippi and Georgia have requested disaster declarations from the United States Department of Agriculture, and Alabama is likely to follow suit. But help from Washington, in the form of low-interest loans, often takes a year or more to reach the farmers who need it.Lester Spell Jr., the Mississippi commissioner of agriculture and commerce, has asked Congress and the Agriculture Department to speed up the process, saying in a news release, “I fear many of our hardworking Mississippi farmers will no longer be able to operate due to the excessive losses faced this year.”Mr. Spell cited losses of more than 40 percent of the state’s soybean crop, almost 50 percent of the cotton and more than 60 percent of the sweet potatoes.For Mr. Hart and his friends, the specter of failure has a double burden because they are among the few black farmers to have survived years of discriminatory policies by the federal Farm Services Administration, which were detailed in a successful class action lawsuit. As part of the settlement in 1999, the Agriculture Department admitted that it had for decades made it harder for black farmers to get loans.“John grew up on the farm; I grew up on the farm,” Mr. Clark said. “We’ve both seen our parents struggle to hold onto this land.”Mr. Clark has also been touched by the recession. Last month, his wife was laid off from her job at a day care center.In December, the land rents are due for next year, but without a crop, the farmers may have no money to pay, and larger farmers will snap up their acreage. Mr. Clark predicted that small black farmers would be unable to return. “If I get out of it,” said Mr. Clark, who rents mostly from black landowners, “this land is gone.”The threat of losing the family land is very real for black and white farmers alike, who have seen generational cycles of prosperity and bankruptcy, of new farmhouses and equipment sold on the auction block. Taylor Flowers Jr., 36, farms land in Coahoma County, where tufts of cotton pile up on the road shoulders. The land was lost by his mother’s family and bought by his father’s, all before his parents married.It is not just that farming is in their blood. Farmers keep on navigating the complicated algebra of seed costs and bank loans, commodity markets and fuel prices, because there is little alternative.“I’ve got a college education, I’ve got a degree in ag business,” Mr. Flowers said. “But I don’t know, if I had to quit, what I’d go do. There’s not many jobs out there right now.”Homer Luckett, 54, another Coahoma farmer, said he had lost about all he could stand.“I’m hoping that the people that I owe will let me spread it out over two or three years,” he said. “I don’t mind quitting, but I don’t want to have to quit. I’m in debt, but I’d like to be able to farm my way out of debt.”On the dashboard of his truck, Allen C. Evans III, a farmer near Clarksdale, has a sheaf of receipts from the grain elevator, showing the damage levels of each load of soybeans: 39.9 percent, 67.9 percent, 51.8 percent. A born fretter, he is afraid to call, he said, to find out the final reckoning of the disastrous season.“You’re just kind of walking around like a zombie,” Mr. Evans said, “saying, never could I have guessed that the best crop I’ve ever raised in my entire life — the one I never worried about — of all the crops to have taken away from us, how can this be the one?”In the Delta, those elevator receipts have become talismans of the times. Michael Patterson, who helps pay for his farming with the proceeds from his grain hauling company, displayed one showing a farmer who brought in 1,110 bushels of soybeans, but got paid for 11. The rest were damaged.That farmer was distraught, Mr. Patterson said.“You don’t want to be the generation,” he said, “that loses the family farm.”'"
"'09-11-23,'1','Consumer Reports has a love-hate relationship with the holiday shopping season. If you are determined to spend a month’s income on a stove, for example, it wants to help you find the best one. But the magazine would just as soon warn you off inflated prices, features you do not need, credit card interest, extended warranties — in other words, caution against spending too much.So on Monday, for the fourth year in a row, Consumer Reports is taking out a full-page ad in a national newspaper, trying to take a little air out of the holiday shopping euphoria. And a message that sounded contrarian at the height of the last expansion now seems more in tune with the times.The new ad, appearing in USA Today, says, “It’s time we told retailers how you feel about their pushy holiday-season practices.” Then it cites results from a national survey showing that most Americans do not like it when store employees ask them to sign up for store credit cards, ask for phone numbers or e-mail addresses, push extended product warranties or fail to open more checkout lanes when there are lines.Consumer Reports said it had paid $143,000 for the ad.“I wouldn’t say there’s less need” than in the boom years, James A. Guest, president and chief executive of Consumers Union, the advocacy group that publishes the magazine, said. “People are buying less, but people want to be smarter buyers.”Extended warranties are a particular peeve for Consumer Reports, which has inveighed against them for years. They were the subject of the first in its series of holiday season ads, in 2006, prompting an opposing ad in USA Today from the Service Contract Industry Council, a group representing the sellers of those warranties.'"
"'09-11-23,'1','The coffee clash of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, began with an innocuous blog post promoting the opening of a new cafe on Franklin Avenue last month. That caught the eye of another business opening about the same time just two blocks away on the same avenue — by coincidence, it happened to be another cafe.The owners of the second shop posted a comment announcing their opening and boasting of purveying organic coffee. That provoked a pointed retort from the owner of the first shop, the Pulp and the Bean. “I won’t be selling organic coffee (whatever that is) but I will have really good coffee,” the owner, Tony Fisher, wrote.Things got nastier when Mr. Fisher posted an e-mail message from one of his workers informing him that he was quitting to go work for the competition, the Breukelen Coffee House. Mr. Fisher accused the rival shop of planting a “mole” and vowed to “buy your coffee machines in about eight months when you decide to close up.”The other side did not respond, but in an interview, the owners of the Breukelen Coffee House called Mr. Fisher’s behavior unprofessional.Something as simple as a rivalry between similar businesses in any neighborhood can take on an added dimension on the Internet. Signs in store windows and ads in local newspapers have been replaced with flaming blog posts and mass e-mail messages.On the lackluster commercial strip of Franklin Avenue, dominated by hair-braiding salons, discount stores and takeout restaurants, perhaps the tension between these two shop owners is in their roots.'"
"'09-11-23,'1','MUMBAI, India — Reliance Industries, the largest private company in India, said that it had made an offer to acquire a controlling interest in the world’s third-largest chemical company, LyondellBasell.Reliance did not disclose late Saturday how much it was willing to pay for LyondellBasell, but a person briefed on the offer said the final price could range from $6 billion to $12 billion in cash. That could make it the biggest deal in Reliance’s history and one of the largest ever by an Indian company.For Reliance, the deal would provide a chance to vault into the top ranks of global corporations in one swoop. Until now, the company has not sought to grow by making big acquisitions. Rather, it has mostly built huge businesses in refining, oil exploration and textiles from the ground up.But last week, Reliance’s chairman and managing director, Mukesh D. Ambani, told shareholders that the company was on the hunt for acquisitions, especially in oil refining. Reliance already operates the world’s largest refinery and has been expanding into exploration for natural gas and oil.LyondellBasell, which took on billions of dollars of debt in a merger in 2007, filed for bankruptcy protection in January. The bankruptcy court is considering a proposal by creditors and investment firms to infuse new equity and wipe out much of the company’s debt.'"
"'09-11-23,'1','“We were told it was the land of milk and honey, that we would ride a horse every day to school,” Mr. Humphreys, 76, said by phone from his home in Perth. “We all put our hands up because we didn’t have a clue where Australia was and we thought it was a bit of an adventure.”Last Monday at a ceremony in , Australia’s prime minister, , formally apologized for the program, expressing contrition to all who bore “the physical suffering, the emotional starvation and the cold absence of love, of tenderness, of care,” that characterized the experiences of many child migrants. “Sorry for the tragedy, the absolute tragedy, of childhoods lost,” he said.The opposition leader, Malcolm Turnbull, broke down as he, too, apologized, prompting a wave of applause from audience members, Mr. Humphreys among them. “We acknowledge that already feeling alone, abandoned and left without love, many of you were beaten and abused, physically, sexually, mentally — treated like objects, not people — leaving you feeling of even less worth,” Mr. Turnbull said.The apologies in Australia set the stage for one by Britain for what the children’s minister, Ed Balls, has called “a stain on our society.” But officials in said Prime Minister would delay his apology until early next year, perhaps to allow time to weigh demands for financial compensation made by survivors of the program in Australia. Survivors have suggested as a model the more than a billion dollars in compensation that the in the has made in the past two decades to victims of sexual abuse in church-run institutions.The Rudd government has already said there will be no compensation in Australia. The Canadian government has gone further, saying it has no plans to apologize for its program, which outstripped Australia’s. Studies in Canada have shown that as many as 100,000 British children were sent there from about 1860 to 1939, when the Canadian program was effectively halted.An association of former child migrants called Children Canada, the term by which child migrants were known, estimates that two-thirds of the children sent to Canada were abused. In his 1980 book, “The Little Immigrants,” the journalist Kenneth Bagnell documented examples of sexual and physical mistreatment, as well as widespread flouting of regulations that required farmers to pay children’s wages into trust accounts.But because there are relatively few of the migrants still living in Canada, the issue has gained less political traction than in Australia. Jason Kenney, Canada’s minister of citizenship and , told the Canadian Press news agency after Mr. Rudd’s apology that there was no need for Canada to apologize. Other Canadian officials have said that most of the children who were transported to Canada were not abused.The extent of the abuse suffered by the children who went to Australia was extensively chronicled in a 1998 report by the ’s Select Committee on Health, and in a 2001 report by the Australian Senate. The reports set out the harsh colonial rationales that underpinned Britain’s thinking in sustaining the migration over 350 years, and explored the miseries the program caused, through interviews with victims.The British report said the impetus for the program came from the mixture of realpolitik and idealism that ran through Britain’s centuries of empire-building. “On the one hand, there was a genuine philanthropic desire to rescue children from the destitution and neglect in Britain and send them to a better life in the colonies,” the report said. “This went hand in hand with a wish to protect children from ‘moral danger’ arising from their home circumstances — for instance, if their mothers were prostitutes.”The report also cited more hard-headed calculations rooted in the overcrowded poorhouses and orphanages described by Dickens. “Child migration was often seen to be of economic benefit both to Britain (because it relieved the burden on public finances of looking after these children) and to the receiving countries (because child migrants were seen as being potential members of a healthy and well-trained work force),” it said.The program also had a racial motive, the report said. It quoted John Hennessey, a former child migrant, as describing “how on arrival in Fremantle he and the other children were greeted by a senior clergyman who said: ‘We need white stock. We need this country to be populated by white stock because we are terrified of the Asian hordes.’ ”Perhaps the grimmest part of the story lies in the incidence of sexual abuse. Mr. Humphreys said that because he was older than many of the children at Bindoon, and better able to defend himself, he escaped what the report described as the “quite exceptional depravity” that was the norm there and at several other Australian institutions. The report cited one boy who had testified to the inquiry that the members of the Christian Brothers had “competed as to who could him 100 times first.”The report acknowledged that many child migrants thrived. One of those who made a successful career in Australia was David Hill, who became the director general of the state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation, after his impoverished single mother responded to a British newspaper advertisement promising a better life for children in Australia in 1959. But Mr. Hill, too, suffered after arriving in his new homeland.In an interview at corporation headquarters in , he said the voyage from Britain, aboard a luxury liner with five-course meals, had been followed by a spartan life working on farms and as domestic helpers in an isolated settlement in New South Wales. There was limited opportunity for education, and a common experience of beatings and sexual abuse, a theme that ran through both the British and Australian parliamentary reports.“The scheme was an amazing piece of British empire social engineering,” he said. “Rather than address why British society generated such appalling inequality and poverty, the British empire simply exported large numbers of its poor children. People don’t appreciate how big, and how recent, it all was.”'"

Make the fruit puree well in advance, and beat the egg whites before you sit down to dinner. Then, when you’re too full to eat anything more, fold the two together and put the soufflés in the oven. Just when you’re beginning to think you could eat a little dessert, they’ll be ready.Butter for the ramekin (or ramekins)1. Fill a bowl with water, and add the juice of 1/2 lemon. Place the fruit in the water as you prepare it. When all of the fruit is prepared, drain and transfer to a large, heavy saucepan. Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the vanilla and ginger, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir, and then turn the heat down to low, cover and simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Uncover and continue to simmer for another 30 to 40 minutes, stirring often, until the fruit is very soft and beginning to stick to the pan. It may or may not look like applesauce, depending on the texture of the apples and pears that you used (Granny Smith apples, for example, will break down, whereas Galas will not). Remove from the heat, and transfer to a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Puree until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl, and allow to cool.2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees with the rack adjusted to the lowest position. Butter one 2-quart soufflé dish or six 6-ounce ramekins and dust with sugar (use about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the sugar).3. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed for one minute or until they foam. Add the cream of tartar, and continue to beat on low speed for one minute. Turn the speed to medium, and slowly stream in the remaining sugar while you continue to beat until there are firm, satiny peaks. Be careful not to overbeat.'"

For the whole of their remarkably long history, the people of China have proved themselves willing to live under repressive regimes that have no patience for dissent.The emperors, ideologues and technocrats who have ruled China have been superficially very different. The cowed obedience they demand of the general population has been, and remains, sadly the same.And while the economic transformation that has taken place in the last generation is impressive, it has come at a high cost. Much of the Chinese landscape is now poisoned by levels of pollution found in few other places in the world.And China’s behavior toward other countries and cultures can be described as brutally pragmatic at best. Its systematic disemboweling of the indigenous culture of Tibet, which included mass murder and the destruction of thousands of unique monasteries, is the most extreme and contemptible example of this.So, yes, China makes a lot of things and has become much wealthier. But in the grand scheme of things, this doesn’t impress me as much as it does Mr. Brooks.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','In stock trading Monday, Pfizer shares were up 17 cents, closing at $18.53, near their 52-week high.But plaintiffs’ lawyers say they are winning the overall legal battle over hormone therapy, contending they have secured financial settlements for undisclosed amounts in at least 10 other cases before the suits went to trial.The issue has become Pfizer’s by dint of its acquisition of two companies — Pharmacia in 2003 and Wyeth in January — that marketed the drugs as a standard, long-term hormone treatment for menopausal women, until medical evidence emerged indicating that such therapy raised women’s risk of breast cancer.The Philadelphia cases were filed there because Wyeth’s headquarters had been there. Esther E. Berezofsky, a lawyer for one of the women who won the awards in Philadelphia said Monday, “This is just the tip of the iceberg.”She said that in cases that had reached jury judgments, women with breast cancer had won damages in 10 of the 12 hormone drug cases, although many are on appeal. Ms. Berezofsky also said a federal appeals court decision in St. Louis this month had significantly improved plaintiffs’ chances of receiving punitive damages and winning appeals.In that decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit overturned an award of $27 million for an Arkansas woman, citing improper testimony by an expert witness. But the court ordered a new trial on punitive damages. The judges’ ruling said “there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude that Wyeth acted with reckless disregard to the risk of injury.”Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company filed a motion last week asking the panel or the full appellate court to review that decision. The hormonal drugs are still used by millions of women to treat symptoms of menopause. But after estrogen was linked to breast cancer in 2002 by a federally financed research effort, the Women’s Health Initiative, the Food and Drug Administration added black-box warnings to the drugs’ labels, cautioning that they be used at the smallest possible doses for the shortest possible time.Sales of the drugs exceeded $2 billion a year before the 2002 study and then plunged, although they have regained some ground. Last year, $1.4 billion in estrogen drugs and nearly $400 million in estrogen-progestin combinations were sold in the United States, according to IMS Health, an industry consulting firm.Wyeth makes Premarin, which contains estrogen, and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin. Pharmacia and Upjohn made Provera, a progestin hormone sometimes combined with estrogen.On Monday a jury in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court awarded $28 million in punitive damages to Donna Kendall of Decatur, Ill., whose breast cancer was found after she had taken hormone drugs for 11 years. The jury had already given her $6.3 million in compensatory damages.Punitive damages in Pennsylvania require a finding of “wanton and reckless” conduct. The jurors heard testimony that Wyeth paid consultants and ghostwriters of medical journal articles to play down concerns about breast cancer, as well as testimony that Pharmacia did not study known risks. The punitive award was split $16 million for Wyeth and $12 million for Pharmacia.After that ruling was made public, Sandra M. Moss, the judge who leads the complex litigation program at the Philadelphia court, unsealed a $75 million punitive damage award from last month in a case brought against Wyeth by Connie Barton of Peoria, Ill. She was also awarded $3.7 million in compensatory damages previously made public.Mr. Anderson, the Bernstein analyst, said it was significant and in Pfizer’s favor that the hormone products were still F.D.A.-approved. Other products whose makers have paid many billions of dollars in damages were withdrawn from the market, he said, citing Merck’s Vioxx, a painkiller that was linked to heart attacks and strokes, and American Home Products’ fen-phen, an antiobesity drug linked to heart and lung risks.“This isn’t nearly as clear-cut,” Mr. Anderson said. “And you have this more-difficult-to-prove breast cancer injury.”But Tobias L. Millrood, a lawyer for Ms. Kendall, said some of the jurors in Philadelphia told him and defense lawyers Monday that the evidence showed that the companies had clearly put profits over safety. Mr. Millrood and defense lawyers were allowed by a judge to talk with the jurors after the award was made.Mr. Millrood called on Pfizer to settle the cases. “It’s not a responsible reaction to keep these women on hold forever,” he said.Pfizer took the opposite view. Mr. Loder, the spokesman, said Wyeth and Pharmacia did nothing wrong and Pfizer would appeal all of its losses.“We feel very strongly that Wyeth and Pharmacia acted responsibly,” Mr. Loder said. “They provided accurate warnings, performed studies on benefits and risks, and kept the F.D.A. fully informed.”'"

He is divorced with grown children, none of them dancers.Lesson of the day: The most important thing, you have to know the count. It’s all about the numbers. You have to count. Even on Broadway, Off Broadway, they’re smiling, but they’re counting. “One, two, three, right, left.”Mantra: I tell the seniors, “By doing this, you keep out of the pharmacy.”On his feet: These are dance spectators, like the Nicholas Brothers and Fred Astaire wore. See the thin soles?A voice made for dancing: I grew up in Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy. I quit high school after a year. I got caught up with things. No one asked me what my problems were. We got into little stuff like block turf. I wanted to be in singing groups but I realized I couldn’t sing. They used to say, “You should stick to dancing.”Where he learned to swing: I had a passion for the dance. The dancing — it was just there, it was such a natural thing for me. I went to the Ned Williams dance school on 14th Street and Sixth Avenue. I went three times a week. He demanded taking ballet. I also did Haitian dancing, African dance, jazz.Where he learned to swing and make (a little) money: I started working with models. I’d rent out a studio. The models would model clothes, footwear, swimwear, sometimes dance. I was the director who dances. The shops would get credit. People paid to see it. I had the talent, but not enough management.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Tyson Foods reported disappointing margins for its chicken business on Monday as market prices fell and grain costs rose.The company reported a quarterly profit after one-time items that beat Wall Street expectations on the strength of its beef and pork businesses, but investors focused on the performance of its poultry operations, which came in well below that of rivals like Pilgrim’s Pride.Donnie Smith, a veteran at the company who became chief executive last week, said in a conference call that the chicken business should improve in 2010, but added that the company would need to increase volume and do a better job of managing inventory.“It’s important to remember that we significantly reduced inventory in 2009, so to keep up with current domestic demand, we’ll have to produce this year what we took out of inventory last year,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ll be doing what we should be doing, which is selling what we produce and not confusing the freezer with the customer.”Tyson reported a net loss of $455 million, or $1.22 a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended on Oct. 3, compared with a year-earlier profit of $48 million, or 13 cents a share.Excluding a good-will impairment charge for its beef business, Tyson earned 28 cents a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue at Tyson rose slightly, to $7.21 billion from $7.20 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $6.88 billion.Operating margins at the chicken segment came in at 1.2 percent, much below analysts’ forecasts.Tyson expects the strength in its pork and beef businesses to continue in its new fiscal year and said that it saw a chance for the economy to improve in the last half of the year.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','WASHINGTON — In honoring Zimbabwe’s tenacious women protesters at the White House on Monday, President Obama gave his sharpest critique yet of President Robert Mugabe, the octogenarian who has ruled the southern African country with repressive zeal since 1980. Mr. Obama bluntly referred to him as a dictator.“In the end, history has a clear direction and it is not the way of those who arrest women and babies for singing in the streets,” he said. “It is not the way of those who starve and silence their own people, who cling to power by the threat of force.”Mr. Obama’s decision to publicly recognize Women of Zimbabwe Arise, or Woza, whose members have taken to the streets for years to demand democracy, will probably confirm Mr. Mugabe’s belief that the United States and the West are out to topple him, already a recurrent theme in the state-run media he controls.Though engaged in a power-sharing government since February, Mr. Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party have deployed state security forces to arrest and jail rival politicians and party workers, human rights lawyers and civic leaders.Regional heads of state, worried that the government led by Mr. Mugabe and his nemesis, Morgan Tsvangirai, will crumble, have insisted the men settle their differences in coming weeks, but so far Mr. Mugabe has shown no inclination to bend.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Blue is sometimes not an easy color to make.Blue pigments of the past have often been expensive (ultramarine blue was made from the gemstone lapis lazuli, ground up), poisonous (cobalt blue is a possible carcinogen and Prussian blue, another well-known pigment, can leach cyanide) or apt to fade (many of the organic ones fall apart when exposed to acid or heat).So it was a pleasant surprise to chemists at Oregon State University when they created a new, durable and brilliantly blue pigment by accident.The researchers were trying to make compounds with novel electronic properties, mixing manganese oxide, which is black, with other chemicals and heating them to high temperatures.Then Mas Subramanian, a professor of material sciences, noticed that one of the samples that a graduate student had just taken out of the furnace was blue.In the intense heat, almost 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the ingredients formed a crystal structure in which the manganese ions absorbed red and green wavelengths of light and reflected only blue.When cooled, the manganese-containing oxide remained in this alternate structure. The other ingredients — white yttrium oxide and pale yellow indium oxide — are also required to stabilize the blue crystal. When one was left out, no blue color appeared.The pigments have proven safe and durable, Dr. Subramanian said, although not cheap because of the cost of the indium.

His contract runs only through 2010, and if Minnesota does not secure him by then, the Yankees, the Red Sox and other high-payroll teams will be lurking.Mauer said he had not set a deadline for a deal, saying only that he was excited to play next season at Target Field, the Twins’ new outdoor home. Twins fans hope Mauer will stay because of his St. Paul roots and because his agent, Ron Shapiro, also represented the career Twin Kirby Puckett.“I’m not the kind of guy that says by this date, we need to have something done,” Mauer said. “I just try to let it happen when it needs to happen.”Mauer, a Gold Glove catcher, became the first player since George Brett in 1980 to lead the A.L. in batting (.365), on-base percentage (.444) and slugging percentage (.587) in a season. He fell just short of becoming the first unanimous M.V.P. since Barry Bonds in the National League in 2002.Keizo Konishi of The Kyodo News, representing the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, gave a first-place vote to Cabrera, who finished fourth over all. Cabrera had stellar numbers (.324, 34 homers, 103 runs batted in) but showed startlingly poor judgment during the final weekend of the regular season, with the Tigers fighting to stay in the A.L. Central race.Cabrera was picked up at a police station by Tigers General Manager Dave Dombrowski between 7:30 and 8 a.m. on the next-to-last day of the regular season, with Detroit clinging to a one-game lead in the division.Cabrera had been partying with members of the visiting Chicago White Sox, and the police said his blood-alcohol level was 0.26, more than three times the legal limit in Michigan for driving. Cabrera’s wife had called 911 at 6:05 that morning to report that the two were fighting, and Cabrera had a bruise and cut on his left cheek.He went 0 for 4 that night, with runners on base each time. The Tigers lost to drop into a tie with the Twins, and they never recovered, losing a one-game playoff at the Metrodome three days later.“We know he made a mistake; he knows he made a mistake,” Dombrowski told Detroit reporters after the season.“I feel confident that he’s going to address the issues he needs to address to take care of the problems that he has.”Cabrera appeared on all 28 ballots but had more support for 10th place (three votes) than for first. Konishi did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.“He’s one of the best players in the game,” Mauer said of Cabrera. “He had another great year. He kept the Tigers in the race the whole year. If he wasn’t there, I don’t think they would have been playing in Game 163.”Teixeira and Jeter, who joined Mauer as A.L. Gold Glove winners, were also named on every ballot. In his first season as a Yankee, Teixeira tied Tampa Bay’s Carlos Pena for the league lead in home runs, with 39, while batting .292 with 122 R.B.I.Teixeira’s previous best finish in the voting was seventh, for Texas in 2005. Other recent Yankees runners-up include Tino Martinez (to Ken Griffey Jr. in 1997), Gary Sheffield (to Vladimir Guerrero in 2004) and Jeter to Morneau in 2006.In the nine seasons since the Yankees’ 2000 championship, Jeter has had better statistics only once, in 2006. He hit .334 this season, with an O.P.S. (combined on-base and slugging percentage) of .871. Jeter also had 212 hits, establishing himself as the Yankees’ franchise leader.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Retailers are already fighting for every dollar consumers spend this holiday season. Sales are not expected to drop as much as they did last season, but the National Retail Federation, an industry group, predicts that they will decline 1 percent, to $437.6 billion.Of course, Wal-Mart and Amazon are fundamentally different companies, and for now, at least, Amazon poses little immediate threat to the behemoth from Bentonville, Ark.Wal-Mart, with $405 billion in sales last year, dominates by offering affordable prices to Middle America in its 4,000 stores. Amazon is a relative schooner to Wal-Mart’s ocean liner, with $20 billion in sales, mostly from affluent urbanites who would rather click with their mouse than push around a cart.This fight, then, is all about the future. Rapid expansion by each company, as well as profound shifts in the high-tech landscape, now make direct confrontation inevitable. Though online shopping accounts for only around 4 percent of retail sales, that percentage is growing quickly. E-commerce did not suffer as deeply as regular retailing during the economic malaise, and it is recovering faster than in-store shopping. People are also shopping on smartphones and from their HDTVs.Amazon, based in Seattle, has harnessed all of these trends, and is also behaving more like a traditional retailer. This fall it expanded its white-labeling program, slapping the Amazon brand onto audio and video cables and other products, and introduced same-day shipping in seven cities, trying to replicate the instant gratification of offline shopping.For rivals both real and putative, Amazon is expanding its slice of the retail pie at what must be an alarming rate. In the third quarter of this year, regular retail sales dipped by about 4 percent and e-commerce over all was flat. But Amazon sales shot up 24 percent, sending its shares soaring.More important for Wal-Mart, sales in Amazon’s electronics and general merchandise business — which competes directly with much of the selection in Wal-Mart stores — were up 44 percent. Wal-Mart does not break out Web sales, but it has been reported that its online business produces revenue of several billion dollars.“If you are Wal-Mart, you want to have your proportional piece of this change in consumer behavior,” said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps retailers sell online. “You can even paint a scenario where e-commerce one day is 15 percent of all shopping, and that could really start to erode Wal-Mart’s offline business.”That is why many analysts are unsurprised that Wal-Mart executives have placed Amazon squarely in their sights, with public throw-downs in interviews and pointed discounting.It began last month with what appeared to be a public-relations-oriented competition on book prices, with both companies (along with Target, based in Minneapolis) dropping prices on books like “Under the Dome,” by Stephen King, to below $9.The companies then began jousting over the prices of DVDs. Less visibly, there were isolated skirmishes, some of which also lowered prices in Wal-Mart’s stores. Wal-Mart offered a $15 gift card with a purchase of the new video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 — and Amazon matched soon after.Wal-Mart and Amazon then both offered the Xbox 360 gaming console for $199 — with a $100 gift card thrown in. Last week, they both began offering the new Palm Pixi phone for around $30 — nearly $175 off the suggested retail price.Of course, online retailers have always competed on price, monitoring rivals’ sites for changes and adjusting accordingly.“We’ve grown up in a supercompetitive environment where customers can check prices with one click, and we like it that way,” said Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman.But rhetoric from Wal-Mart itself has stoked the flames of rivalry. In an interview last week, Raul Vazquez, the president and chief executive of Walmart.com, asserted that the site was growing faster than Amazon’s; suggested that Amazon Prime, a two-day-shipping service that costs $80 a year, was too expensive; and said that it was “only a matter of time” before Wal-Mart dominated Web shopping.“Our company is based on low prices,” Mr. Vazquez said, laying down a challenge. “Even in books, we kept going until we were the low-price leader. And we will do that in every category if we need to.”Friction between the two companies is not entirely new. In the late 1990s, Amazon assembled at least some of its knowledge of retail supply chains by hiring away Wal-Mart employees. Wal-Mart sued, and the two companies settled privately.In a battle over prices, Wal-Mart is on more familiar turf. With its unmatched size, Wal-Mart has more leverage than anyone to negotiate better terms with suppliers. Offering the lowest price “is in our DNA,” Mr. Vazquez said.Among Amazon’s advantages are a sophisticated distribution network built specifically for Web shopping, the thousands of outside sellers who offer products on Amazon.com, and a recognizable online brand. Amazon’s customers also do not pay sales tax in most states, a crucial advantage that companies like Wal-Mart, and their lobbyists, are trying to eliminate.Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, is fond of saying that retailing is a big market with room for many winners. But for Ms. Dias, from GSI Commerce, Wal-Mart’s campaign against Amazon is overdue. As an executive at the now-defunct Circuit City chain, and as an adviser to traditional retailers today, she says she has watched many companies overlook the long-term threat posed by Amazon.“We have to put our foot down and refuse to let them grow more powerful,” she said. “I applaud Wal-Mart. It’s about time multichannel retailers stood up and refused to let their business go away.”'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Creating compelling television out of jacked-up interest rates, compounded penalty fees and software code rigged to rip off credit card customers is no mean feat. “The Card Game,” a new production in the long-running “Frontline” documentary series on PBS, does a fine job of it.This latest look at the questionable practices of the American credit card industry has two important things going for it: briskly paced content with a high outrage quotient and casting that draws clear distinctions between good guys and bad guys.The program, a co-production with The New York Times, springs from the enactment in May of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. As the calendar counts down through a lobbyist-induced, eight-month delay to the law’s effective date, the card companies have been infuriating consumers by hiking rates on existing balances, lowering credit limits and inventing new ways to induce late payments and trigger multiple penalty fees.Lowell Bergman, the on-camera interviewer who wrote and produced the documentary with Oriana Zill de Granados, corrals a diverting assortment of players. Opening the program is Shailesh Mehta, a former chief executive of Providian Financial Corporation, a credit card company that pioneered what he calls “penalty pricing” or “stealth pricing.” With disarming candor, Mr. Mehta reviews the tactics that lure new cardholders, many with poor credit records, with promises of no annual fees and initial zero-interest periods, only to squeeze them later with high interest rates and fees lurking in the fine print of their account contracts.The program, which has its premiere on Tuesday night, offers brief case studies of people caught in the resulting credit vise. Among them: Ben Collins, a construction contractor whose small business has been paralyzed by the arbitrary reduction of his firm’s credit card limit; Don Bollinger, a rural worker who survived cancer but was forced into bankruptcy after he lost his job and his credit card company doubled the interest rate and minimum payments on his existing balances; and Josette Wermuth, whose debit card’s mandatory overdraft “protection” ended up costing her $365 in penalty fees after a $7 pizza purchase left her with a negative account balance.Caught between the complaints of constituents and industry muscle, politicians including Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and a member of the House Financial Services Committee, recount repeated legislative and administrative opportunities to rein in abusive practices, only to see reform bills killed or emasculated by lobbying power and regulatory authority neutralized by ideological posturing.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','“A lot of the artists who were reporting were telling us, ‘I live in a recession all the time, so this downturn has really not been so different for me,’ ” said Judilee Reed, the executive director of Leveraging Investments in Creativity.The artists surveyed tended to earn either very little of their overall income from their artwork or almost all of it. Slightly more than 40 percent said that in 2008 they earned 20 percent or less of their total income from their art.But at the other end of the spectrum 28 percent said creative work accounted for 80 percent or more of their income, and those artists were often those whose incomes were higher, $80,000 or more. Visual artists (who made up half of the respondents) and writers were more likely to earn 20 percent or less of their income from art.Even artists whose second jobs have carried them through the downturn relatively unscathed said that the climate for creative work was more difficult. Esther Robinson, a Brooklyn filmmaker whose 2007 documentary, “A Walk Into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory,” was partly paid for with credit cards, money later recouped with an advance from a distributor, said, “This year there are almost no advances available for the same kind of film that is of a certain quality and that is theatrically releasable.”Ms. Robinson, who also runs a nonprofit arts organization that she founded, said that she was concentrating on short films because “I don’t see a way to finance any of the feature ideas I have for documentaries right now.”Perhaps because artists tend to have an idealistic bent, the survey found, however, that many also reported upsides to the downturn: that it has given them freedom to experiment and to spend more time on their art when avenues for making money are closed. James Vira, a Manhattan architect who recently lost his job in a round of layoffs at Cooper, Robinson & Partners, is trying to make it on his own by doing consulting work, taking on small projects and designing furniture and other objects.“It’s allowing me to pursue things that I really want to pursue, and it’s working out so far,” said Mr. Vira, the father of two young children. “I’m very, very hopeful. But I still check the want ads — as a habit, I guess.”'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Geoff Freeman, senior vice president for public affairs for the U.S. Travel Association, said that business travel was unfairly characterized as an excessive perk in the wake of the taxpayer-financed bank bailouts last year. “It left the industry terribly exposed,” he said. “There was anger, there was emotion, but there was not enough data.”Adam Sacks, managing director of Oxford Economics, the firm that prepared the U.S. Travel Association report, said the results confirmed the bottom-line value of business travel using government data that covered 14 economic sectors over 13 years, a broad review of related research and surveys of corporate executives and business travelers.To some extent, Mr. Sacks said, the findings confirmed what business people already knew intuitively: curbing travel may save money in the short term, but there are significant long-term benefits from investing in business travel. “Not all cuts are smart cuts,” he said.Last fall and spring, Brian Jacobsen, co-president of Madison Park Greetings, a stationery and gift company in Seattle, said he carefully weighed how best to ride out the tough economic climate, and “made a strategic decision to do more travel.” He made cuts in other areas, and paid almost every bill using credit cards so the company could earn free tickets. “We have actually increased our travel budget this year by 20 percent,” he said. “We saw it as an opportunity to have more of a presence while our competitors have been cutting back.”In September, for example, his company provided the featured gift tote bags for celebrities at a fund-raising luncheon before the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. He also sent the designer of the bags to network there. Her presence was not essential but “led to all sorts of opportunities,” he said.The company was asked to provide gifts for similar philanthropic events preceding the American Music Awards this past weekend and the Golden Globe Awards in January, Mr. Jacobsen said. “It was all the result of one travel trip.”Brian Parish, president of IData, a technology consulting company for higher education based in Alexandria, Va., said he, too, saw the direct effect of in-person encounters. Earlier this year, negotiations for a couple of projects stalled. “They seemed on the fence,” he recalled. “We braced ourselves.” So he quickly flew out to meet the prospective clients.“We got the deal,” in both cases, said Mr. Parish, who estimated the accounts to be worth a total of well over $400,000. “They were two clients we probably wouldn’t have had without making the trip. It showed them we were serious,” he said.Craig A. Banikowski, president of the National Business Travel Association, noted in an e-mail message that two separate studies reached essentially the same conclusion. “When you read either study,” he said, “you come away with the same questions: Is my business investing enough in traveling? Are my competitors going to gain the edge by optimizing their travel? Answering these questions effectively could mean the difference between surviving and thriving as we climb out of the recession.”Brooks C. Holtom, associate professor of management at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, said he was initially skeptical of the two reports. After reading both, Professor Holtom said that “deeper analysis would have benefited organizational decision makers since the return on investment varies substantially by type of travel and industry.”But despite some concerns, “I agree with the broad findings” of the reports, he said, “In fact, relationships with people matter. All else equal, people do business with people they like.”Mitch Mounger, president of Sunrise Identity, a promotional merchandise agency in the Seattle area, said his company had struggled to maintain the right balance.“We certainly have felt the pain of the economic downturn, and it has impacted our business travel decisions,” Mr. Mounger said. He no longer has a set travel budget, for example, and each trip must be justified. “There are less fishing expeditions,” he said.The company now uses several strategies to make trips affordable and productive, like arranging meetings all in one day to avoid hotel stays, and clustering cities and regions into one trip rather than making several. Sales representatives even call on colleagues’ clients if they happen to be in the area, unheard of before.“We believe in business travel,” Mr. Mounger said. “You just have to be smart about it.”He added, “I don’t have data, but every time we do it, good things happen.”'"
"'09-11-24,'0','The Obama administration has so far resisted demands that it commit to a specific emissions reduction goal, saying that it could not pre-empt Congress, which has stalled on climate change legislation. China, the world’s largest emitter of climate-altering gases, has also refused to spell out its plans for reducing emissions, although President Hu Jintao promised in September that his country would reduce the amount of emissions per unit of economic output by a “notable margin.”Many observers of the climate negotiations expect China to deliver a more specific pledge on this so-called carbon intensity target before the Copenhagen meeting opens.Mr. Obama has come under criticism from leaders of dozens of countries that have already set domestic greenhouse gas reduction targets. He is also under fire from numerous environmental advocates who say the United States, the world’s second-largest emitter, must take a credible commitment to Copenhagen to ensure that the talks do not fall apart.The House passed a measure in June that calls for a 17 percent reduction over 2005 levels of the domestic emissions of the gases that contribute to the heating of the planet. A Senate committee passed a bill last month that sets a 20 percent target, but that is likely to be weakened in future negotiations.Paul Bledsoe of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy said the president’s hands were tied by Congressional inaction. “The U.S. cannot negotiate at Copenhagen above the targets in domestic legislation without risking support for that legislation in the Senate,” Mr. Bledsoe said. “If European demands continue above the U.S. domestic targets, they set up an impossible dynamic for the administration.”A second administration official briefing reporters on Monday said that Mr. Obama would have a stronger hand at Copenhagen if Congress had already acted on climate change legislation, but that the debate on health care had blocked it.“We would have preferred that health care be done a long time ago, and we’d be having an energy debate today,” the official said.Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Obama could credibly tell delegates to the climate conference that the United States intended to reduce its emissions by 17 percent to 20 percent, based on the legislation that has been approved by the House and the Senate environment committee.“It’s important for the president to exert that leadership with consultation with Congress,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview late last week.Mr. Obama and leaders of a number of other major countries have said that the Copenhagen talks would not yield a comprehensive and binding treaty to address global warming. Instead, the more than 190 nations represented there are expected to produce an interim agreement that addresses the major issues without requiring ratification or international enforcement.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','But there is a third possible retort, one that draws on the Supreme Court’s 2002 decision in Atkins v. Virginia barring the execution of the mentally retarded. That sounds like a rule, in that it made an entire class of people categorically ineligible for the death penalty. But it turns out to be a standard.Proving age is pretty straightforward, and inmates who were under 18 when they committed the crimes that sent them to death row promptly had their sentences commuted after the court’s decision in Roper. The Atkins decision, on the other hand, “has spawned extensive, intricate and bitterly contested litigation,” Carol S. Steiker and M. Steiker wrote in the DePaul Law Review last year.The Supreme Court in Atkins said requires proof of three things: “subaverage intellectual functioning,” meaning low IQ scores; a lack of fundamental social and practical skills; and that both conditions were present before age 18. The court said IQ scores under “approximately 70” typically indicate retardation.How has this standard been applied in practice?A new study from three law professors at Cornell, one that resonates with potential lessons for juvenile life without parole, shows that states making case-by-case determinations have taken wildly different approaches.The study, conducted by John H. Blume, Sheri Lynn Johnson and Christopher Seeds, tried to collect all determinations concerning retardation in capital cases in the six years after Atkins, finding 234. That means about 7 percent of the nation’s roughly 3,200 death row inmates have claimed to be mentally retarded.Nationwide, the claims have succeeded about 38 percent of the time. But state success rates vary widely.courts heard 21 Atkins claims and ruled in the inmate’s favor 17 times. courts heard 26 claims and ruled for the inmate 3 times.Recall that the Supreme Court said an IQ of “approximately 70” should usually satisfy the first part of the test. In Alabama, and , four inmates with IQ scores of 66 and 67 were held not to be retarded. But in , an inmate whose score ranged from 70 to 75 won an Atkins claim. In , a score of 84 did the trick.Professor Johnson said there was a lesson here.“If you look at Atkins, which is supposed to be a categorical rule but has some play in the definitions, you get enormous pushback from the states that don’t want to do it,” she said. Were the court to adopt Chief Justice Roberts’s approach for juvenile life without parole, she added, “the problem of Atkins’s application would be greatly magnified.”Yet there is an obvious appeal to the chief justice’s suggestion.“If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are no line-drawing problems,” he said at the arguments this month. “You just simply say age has to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment.”Justice objected. He had dissented in Atkins and Roper, and he was not brimming with sympathy for the two juvenile offenders in the cases before the court.His problem with Chief Justice Roberts’s proposal was grounded in a preference for easily applied binary rules over mushy standards that give judges too much power.“And then we apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test,” Justice Scalia said dismissively of the chief justice’s proposal, “which means, ‘whatever seems like a good idea.’ ”'"
"'09-11-24,'0','“There is a serious chance Barghouti will be released,” said Danny Danon, deputy speaker of the Israeli and a key member of Prime Minister ’s Likud party, in an interview in his office.But a deputy prime minister, Silvan Shalom, told the ’s Arabic-language service that Mr. Barghouti would not be part of any trade.Mr. Barghouti was elected from prison to a top leadership post this past summer. Some say he is a rare leader who could unify the Palestinian people.While prisoner exchanges have occurred in the past, a deal now would have unusual potential to allow the Israelis to shift some policies toward Palestinians — as well as to unleash new violence against Israel — making an exchange the topic of anguished debate in the country. It is also being passionately debated among Palestinians because of the deep division between Hamas and its rival, the Fatah-dominated .Most Israelis have followed the fate of Sergeant Shalit, who was a corporal when captured but has since been promoted, as if he were their own son. A bespectacled and boyish-seeming 23-year-old, he was last seen in a video released last month, looking thin and wan. His picture and name are everywhere in Israel, and his fate is the topic of endless concern and prayer. Most Israelis perform mandatory military service, and the government goes to sometimes extraordinary lengths to bring home soldiers, or their remains.Yet the release of legions of violent fighters and the chance that Hamas would gain politically over the Palestinian Authority have made this a complex negotiation for the Israelis.“From our point of view, this will lay the ground for the next 9/11,” Yossi Mendellevich, an engineer whose -year-old son, Yuval, died in a bus bombing in Haifa in 2003, said by telephone. “We know they will not turn to macramé and painting,” he said of the security prisoners to be released.“This will give the tail wind to all those in the Arab world who believe the way to defeat Israel is through terrorist activity,” Mr. Mendellevich said. “It will lead to the kidnapping of another soldier and to the next release and so on. What will be the end?”Yaakov Perry, former head of the Shin Bet internal security agency, told Israel Radio that while a real risk existed, “the past has shown that some of the prisoners do not return to terror and some portion are integrated in various operative positions.”Israelis are also concerned by Hamas’s request that some Israeli Arabs be released, fearing that Hamas’s standing would increase among the 20 percent of Israel’s citizens who are Palestinians.Moreover, since Hamas receives support from , any boost for Hamas could strengthen a country that Israel considers the region’s greatest menace.Among Palestinians, any prisoner release is a source of joy and relief. But this is an especially delicate moment in Palestinian politics. Mr. Abbas has vowed not to run again for the Palestinian presidency because of what he said was his frustration over Israeli and American policies. With no clear successor to Mr. Abbas and a stalled peace process, some fear that if released prisoners are seen as gifts from Hamas, Mr. Abbas and his party will suffer a severe blow. How Mr. Barghouti’s release would affect this situation is unclear.Ziad Abu Ein, the Palestinian Authority’s deputy minister for prisoner affairs, played down the damage that a prisoner exchange credited to Hamas could inflict on the authority and Mr. Abbas.“This is the first time that Hamas will be releasing any prisoners,” Mr. Abu Ein said in a telephone interview on Monday. The , by contrast, has released “tens of thousands” over the years, he said.He added that rather than Hamas’s gaining an advantage with the Palestinian people through a deal on Sergeant Shalit, the soldier’s capture led the people of Gaza to pay a heavy price.He was referring, among other things, to the blockade that Israel has imposed on Gaza since Hamas took control there in 2007. The embargo, which bans nearly all commercial and human traffic between Israel and Gaza, is largely aimed at isolating Hamas because of its commitment to Israel’s destruction, and creating a contrast between conditions in Gaza and those in the West Bank, run by the Palestinian Authority.Many governments, including that of the , want to end the embargo to relieve the suffering of the 1.5 million people in Gaza, especially after Israel’s invasion 11 months ago, which destroyed homes and factories. But Israel has said the embargo will not end until Mr. Shalit is free.Therefore, if a deal is really imminent, it may also signal the possibility of some opening of the commercial crossings. Efforts to reconcile Fatah and Hamas, also being brokered by , could conceivably make progress, too.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','MANILA — In one of the worst episodes of election-related violence in the Philippines in recent memory, a group of more than 40 people — including lawyers, journalists and relatives of a local politician — were kidnapped by armed men on Monday, and military officials said at least 21 of them had been killed.Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner, a military spokesman in Manila, the capital, said 21 bodies had been recovered in Maguindanao, a province on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines that has often been wracked by election violence. Thirteen of the dead were women, according to the military. Twenty-two people were unaccounted for, according to military officials.Maj. Gen. Alfredo Cayton, a security official in the province, said in a radio interview that the victims had been shot. But relatives of victims said at least 30 abductees had been killed, and many of them had been beheaded, by a group of about 100 men.Jesus Dureza, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s adviser on Mindanao, recommended that a state of emergency be declared in Maguindanao Province. “Everyone should be disarmed. Anything less will not work,” he said.The victims were reportedly stopped on their way to an election office to file candidacy papers for Esmael Mangudadatu, the deputy mayor of the town of Buluan, who plans to run for governor of Maguindanao. Mr. Mangudadatu said on ABS-CBN television that his wife, his sister and several other female relatives had been in the group and that he had received confirmation that they had been killed.'"
"'09-11-24,'0','Whenever modern humans reached a new continent in the expansion from their African homeland 50,000 years ago, whether Australia, Europe or the Americas, all the large fauna quickly disappeared.This circumstantial evidence from the fossil record suggests that people’s first accomplishment upon reaching new territory was to hunt all its all large animals to death. But apologists for the human species have invoked all manner of alternative agents, like climate change and asteroid impacts.A careful analysis of lake deposits in New York and Wisconsin has brought new data to bear on this heated debate. A team led by Jacquelyn Gill, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, has uncovered a critical sequence of events that rules out some explanations for the extinction of the large animals and severely constrains others.The first event documented by Ms. Gill and her colleagues is the pace of extinction in North America, known from other research to have affected all animal species over about 2,200 pounds and half of those weighing more than about 70 pounds, the weight of a large dog.Ms. Gill found a clever proxy for these disappearances. A fungus known as Sporormiella has to pass through the digestive system to complete its life cycle, and its spores are found in animal dung. By measuring the number of spores in the lake deposits, the Wisconsin team documented the steady disappearance of large animals from 14,800 years to 13,700 years ago, they reported in Thursday’s issue of Science.'"

"'09-11-25,'1','Is the market for credit-default swaps in for a renaissance? George Soros, for one, reckons credit derivatives should be banned. But trading in swaps has so far survived the crisis and market reforms are on the way. Barring unexpectedly draconian regulatory changes, a comeback looks likely.In a credit-default swap, the buyer pays the seller a fee to protect against default on a notional amount of a borrower’s debt, typically in increments of $10 million. If the borrower defaults, the seller pays up. Losses on an oversize book of particularly wacky versions of these derivatives forced the American International Group to take a gigantic government bailout.Cheery forecasts for growth in swaps trading from Icap, a British broker, and the Intercontinental Exchange, the clearinghouse, are therefore a bit surprising. After all, the notional volume of outstanding contracts declined by 14 percent, to $36 trillion, in the first half of 2009, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In part, the decline reflects the efforts of dealers to cancel out offsetting contracts. But trading activity has also fallen.There’s still uncertainty over reforms being mulled by lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe. Sensibly, they mostly want swaps contracts to be traded through central clearinghouses rather than bilaterally, the traditional way of doing business. Done right, that ought to reduce the systemic risk of an individual market participant going bust. It should also mean collateral requirements are standardized and more uniformly enforced. Both reforms would have eased A.I.G.’s troubles.Central clearing of swaps, and maybe exchange trading of the most popular instruments, would accelerate an existing trend toward electronic trading, especially in the United States, which has lagged in that regard. Standardization could also bring in a wider range of users.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','The Lloyds Banking Group, the troubled British lender, said Tuesday that it planned to raise £13.5 billion to keep the government from taking a controlling stake.Lloyds plans to sell new shares at 37 pence each, a 59.5 percent discount to the closing price Monday. The discount is steeper than what other banks, like HSBC and Société Générale, offered their shareholders recently. The British government owns 43 percent of Lloyds after its bailout of the lender.Like its rivals, Lloyds plans to use the proceeds, equivalent to $22.4 billion, to repair its capital base, which suffered after an ill-fated takeover of the mortgage lender HBOS last year. The share offering would be the biggest in Britain and would help the bank avoid using the government’s asset-protection program, which would have raised the government’s stake to a majority.Separately, the Bank of England disclosed Tuesday that it had injected £61.6 billion in emergency funds into Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS at the height of the credit crisis in October 2008 to keep the lenders from collapsing.The Bank of England said the two banks repaid the emergency money by January and were charged an undisclosed fee to use the capital. The central bank said it kept the support a secret until now because it did not want to unsettle the markets even further.Some investors, meanwhile, have raised concerns about the size of the Lloyds share sale, which is worth more than half the bank’s current market value and trumps a £12.5 billion rights issue by HSBC this year.'"

Animal rights activists and some religious groups protested the killings, which a Nepalese minister said were the largest sacrificial slaughter of animals in the world. The sacrifice is part of a two-day festival to honor the Hindu goddess Gadhimai, which is held every five years. During the festival, buffalo, goats, chickens and pigeons are sacrificed in order to end evil and bring prosperity.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','The proposed rule also includes reductions in emissions from industrial and transportation fuels beginning in 2015.California joins a number of other states and regions, including the 10 states of the Northeast, in moving ahead with programs to address global warming as Congress debates a nationwide program. One point of dispute in the legislation is whether the federal government will pre-empt these local and regional efforts and create a single national cap-and-trade program.California, the world’s eighth-largest economy by some measures, was one of the first states to recognize the potential effects of a changing climate. State scientists have identified reduced snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, prolonged droughts, increasing wildfires and growing infestation of pests as some of the results of the warming.The draft of the California program dodges one of the toughest issues in designing any cap-and-trade system: how to allocate permits that allow companies to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A bill that passed the House in June distributes roughly 85 percent of the permits to various parties and industries free in the early years of the program, with more of them auctioned in later years.Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the Air Resources Board, said her preference was for virtually all of the California permits to be auctioned from the start.“Congress started this, you know, as a political exercise to see how many allowances you had to give out to which groups to get them to buy into the program,” Ms. Nichols said in a briefing for reporters, according to Reuters. “We know how many emissions we have to reduce. The question is how do we do it in a way that costs less.”The resources board has scheduled months of hearings and public comment on the rule before it is to be finalized next October.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','“The next time people come to 125th Street, they’ll remember there was something big going on there,” she said. “It’s all about building a lasting impression.” According to Ms. Jenkins, the moves have paid off with year-to-year sales up about 10 percent. She expects them to total about $350,000 for 2009.For other companies, the secret has been tightening expenses to make prices lower. In January, Travis Harris spun off his cellphone accessories business in Ephrata, Pa., from New Covenant Software, his software development firm, founded seven years ago. For one thing, the spun-off company, which Mr. Harris named TheCellGuru.com, begun two years ago and which has four employees, had been growing much faster than the original business. Plus, the two companies had very different business models. “It was easier to handle them as separate corporations,” Mr. Harris said.While he said he usually sold his products at about 10 percent less than competitors did, Mr. Harris decided to reduce his marketing budget and cut prices even further. He eliminated all of his paid advertising on the Web, choosing instead pay-per-click sites like Google Products, through which customers can shop by comparing prices. Mr. Harris was able to pass his savings on to customers, lowering prices by $2 to $3 an item and increasing traffic 200 percent. Year-to-year sales, according to Mr. Harris, have also grown by that amount. “We knew people were searching deeper, looking for the best prices they could find,” he said. “And when they discovered us, they’d say, ‘O.K., this is it.’ ”At Inside Sports and Entertainment, Ety Rybak, a founder, and his partner concluded that the difficult climate called for a significant change in the type of events the 14-employee company organized. The company, based in New York and started five years ago, usually provided deluxe packages to the Super Bowl, Master’s Cup and other major events, which clients used to reward employees or curry favor with their own customers, often spending $10,000 a person. But, last fall, Mr. Rybak realized that his “clients couldn’t possibly spend the kind of money they used to spend. We had to get creative.”Mr. Rybak decided to focus on local extravaganzas that didn’t require paying for airfare or hotels — organizing, for example, a number of large events during the openings of the new Yankee and Citi Field baseball stadiums in April. Another example: For a law firm, he put together a day at the Central Park Zoo, to which clients, employees and their families were invited. Usually, the firm held separate events for each constituency. Alan Baum, president of the company, estimates that revenue will be up about 25 percent this year, to more than $13 million.Even before last fall’s crash, sales at Lexington International, a 12-employee maker of a laser device for treating hair loss, started heading south. “People cut down on nonessential health care items, and we really felt it,” said David Michaels, managing director of the company, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., and was founded nine years ago. When he analyzed his company’s performance, Mr. Michaels concluded that the possibilities for domestic sales growth were slim. But he had started exporting his product, called HairMax, to Canada and Australia in 2001. Perhaps expanding to other countries was the answer.Mr. Michaels turned to the Gold Key Service of the Commerce Department, hiring consultants who spent several months conducting industry research and visiting a handful of countries, the better to pinpoint potential distribution partners. Then, Mr. Michaels traveled to those places to meet his partners in person. At the same time, the consultants helped him understand the regulatory issues he would have to tackle in each country. Ultimately, the licensing process took three to nine months, depending on the region. The most difficult country was South Korea, which, Mr. Michaels said, has a particularly rigorous licensing procedure for medical devices.Now, he is also selling to Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, in addition to South Korea, where, Mr. Michaels said, “There are significant social advantages to having a great head of hair.” He figures that international sales have more than compensated for the decline in the United States.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','In the campaign to broaden support for the overhaul of American health care, few arguments have packed as much rhetorical punch as the there-but-for-the-grace-of-God notion that average families, through no fault of their own, are going bankrupt because of medical debt., in addressing a joint session of Congress in September, called on lawmakers to protect those “who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.” He added: “These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans.”The Senate majority leader, of , made a similar case on Saturday in a floor speech calling for passage of a measure to open debate on his chamber’s health care bill.The legislation moving through Congress would attack the problem in numerous ways.Bills in both houses would expand eligibility for and provide health insurance subsidies for those making up to four times the federal poverty level. Insurers would be prohibited from denying coverage to those with pre-existing health conditions. Out-of-pocket medical costs would be capped annually.How many personal bankruptcies might be avoided is unpredictable, as it is not clear how often medical debt plays a back-breaking role. There were 1.1 million personal bankruptcy filings in 2008, including 12,500 in Nashville, and more are expected this year.Last summer, Harvard researchers published a headline-grabbing paper that concluded that illness or medical bills contributed to 62 percent of bankruptcies in 2007, up from about half in 2001. More than three-fourths of those with medical debt had health insurance.But the researchers’ methodology has been criticized as defining medical bankruptcy too broadly and for the ideological leanings of its authors, some of whom are outspoken advocates for nationalized health care.At the bankruptcy court in Nashville, lawyers provided a spectrum of estimates for the share of cases in Middle Tennessee where medical debt was decisive, from 15 percent to 50 percent. But many said they felt the number had been growing, and might be higher than was obvious because medical bills are often disguised as debt.“This has really become the system for the country,” said Susan R. Limor, a bankruptcy trustee who calculated that of the 48 Chapter 7 liquidation cases on her docket one recent afternoon included medical debts of more than $1,000.Under Chapter 7, a debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are used to pay creditors; any remaining debts are discharged, and filers are left with a 10-year stain on their ratings.“You can’t believe how many people discharge medical debts,” Ms. Limor said. “It’s a kind of trailing indicator of who’s suffering in this economy.”Kyle D. Craddock, a bankruptcy lawyer here, said his medical cases were heartbreaking because the financial devastation was so rapid and ill-timed. “They’re sick, they’re bankrupt, and if they stay sick for too long, they end up losing their jobs as well,” he said.That was the case for Ms. Phillips, 45, who said she was fired in October from her job in a shipping department because she had missed so much work while recuperating from her car accident and operations. Her firing came only 11 days after she filed for bankruptcy, listing about $7,000 in unpaid medical bills among her $187,000 in liabilities.“The medical bills put me over the edge,” said Ms. Phillips, who lost her health insurance along with her job. “I had no money for food at this point. How was I going to do it?”It was the same for the Mullinses, who have two children. They had a and owed money on credit cards and . “But the medical problem is what took us down,” said Ms. Mullins, who is packing to move from the two-bedroom house they will soon surrender to . “Everything was due, they wanted their money now, now, now, and it just became overwhelming.”For some, like Nathan W. Hale, 34, who had an attack of two months after losing his job with a Nashville cable company, it is the absence of insurance that pulls them under. Others, like Robin P. Herron, 35, of Eagleville, Tenn., have insurance, but it is not enough. Her Blue Cross Blue Shield policy covered only 80 percent of the cost when her daughter needed surgery to remove a cyst from a fallopian tube, leaving her $6,000 in debt.After cortisone injections failed to cure his gimpy knee, Mr. Covington, 31, had surgery because the pain was forcing him to miss days of work as an emergency medical technician. His recovery kept him off the job for five months.Simultaneously, his wife, a 911 dispatcher, developed while pregnant and had to take months off on reduced disability pay. Their insurance policy, with an $850 monthly premium, has a $4,000 annual deductible per family.As the bills rolled in, the Covingtons compounded their troubles by placing medical charges on credit cards, simply to make the collection agencies stop calling. They fell months behind on their mortgage, and by August had lost their house and both cars.Mr. Covington, who has taken a second job, said he found it ironic that it had not been the recession that forced them into bankruptcy. “I tell my wife that we beat the economy,” he said, “but health care beat us.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','CHICAGO — This city’s Christmas tree, which by tradition will be lighted by Mayor Richard M. Daley on Wednesday, has already suffered slights.As the tree awaited its grand moment in Daley Plaza downtown, one passer-by this week deemed it spare and wondered whether its branches might break off. Another resident, in one of several letters to local newspapers on the topic, likened Mr. Daley to the Grinch for erecting what the writer called an “ornamental evergreen shrub.”In truth, Chicago’s tree is big. This blue spruce stands 50-some feet tall, and took decades to grow, in the care of the generous suburban family that donated it to the city. If you count the base and the star on top, which city officials appear to prefer to, it stands 60 feet tall, they say.Still, it is a speck of what once filled the plaza. Since 1956, when Mayor Daley’s father ran the city, multiple trees have been shaped together to make an elaborate display. Just last year, 113 trees were fashioned into a towering 85-foot creation. But in recent years, the cost of the weeks of construction and a surrounding display had approached $350,000, a price too steep, the city decided, at a time of deep budget cuts.Chicago is hardly alone in its downsized jollity and energy-saving lights. In Austin, Tex., a beloved “Trail of Lights” tradition will look different — and shorter — this year, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. At the State House in South Carolina, the fir provided by garden clubs is shorter and cheaper.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','Should Bradshaw be unable to play, his replacement would probably be Gartrell Johnson, a rookie who has carried 11 times for 39 yards.Brandon Jacobs (Earth) also left Sunday’s game with an injury to his right leg.“I feel really good,” Jacobs said Tuesday. “It’s all mental. I took a hit near the leg. It could have been worse. I could have gone back in the game.”Danny Ware, the third-string running back, severely injured his right elbow on the season’s opening kickoff. Since returning, he has carried 4 times for 24 yards. Jacobs leads the Giants with 163 carries for 656 yards. Bradshaw is second with 115 for 549.The passing game of Eli Manning paced the Giants’ offense against Atlanta, but the defense again was subpar. The Giants gave up two touchdowns in the last 6 minutes 1 second, allowing Atlanta to force overtime.In the previous game, a 21-20 loss to San Diego before the bye week, the Giants gave up a late touchdown and lost.Although the Giants are still second in the N.F.L. in overall defense, allowing an average of 282.2 yards a game, they are last in efficiency against touchdowns inside the 20-yard line.That means they have given up touchdowns 74.3 percent of the time that opposing teams have the ball in the red zone.Those failures, particularly late in games, have bothered defenders like cornerback Terrell Thomas because much of the damage has been through passing.Chase Blackburn, who filled in at middle linebacker Sunday for the injured Antonio Pierce, said the victory over the Falcons “almost feels like we lost.”Blackburn said the faster tempo of the Atlanta offense created communication problems among his teammates, and that the defense was not always fully prepared for the snap of the ball.“For whatever reason, we didn’t seem to get the checks done right there at the end,” Blackburn said. Pierce said similar things before he was sidelined with a neck injury.Another perception is that the Giants’ pass rush, a strength in the Super Bowl championship after the 2007 season, has not consistently pressured quarterbacks.Defensive end Justin Tuck rejected that idea Tuesday. “We haven’t got the sacks, but I’d dare to say we might lead the league in quarterback presses and quarterback hits,” he said.But Tuck has been hobbled by shoulder and leg injuries. Late in games, at about the time the entire defense sags, Tuck has gotten up slowly after plays, sometimes with the assistance of trainers.Referring not only to himself but to the sagging of the entire defense, Tuck said, “Fatigue might have something to do with it, but I don’t think that’s the all telltale.”Behind him, the secondary has been bolstered by the return of Aaron Ross, who played his first game Sunday after missing the previous nine with a hamstring injury.Instead of playing his usual cornerback position, Ross helped out at safety in packages of five and six defensive backs. Corey Webster remained at the other corner opposite Thomas.“We still have room for improvement,” Webster said. “You never want to give up 30-some points. It was a pretty ugly win. Hopefully, we can move forward and build off it.”Coughlin, when asked to diagnosis why the defense has not been able to stop late passing drives, said, “I wish I had an answer.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','Adidas is planning to move most production of N.B.A. players’ official jerseys and shorts out of the United States, managers of the main factory producing the gear said on Tuesday.With the decision threatening 100 jobs at the factory, American Classic Outfitters in Perry, N.Y., 50 miles east of Buffalo, Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged Adidas not to move the jersey operation.“It is flat wrong for Adidas to move the production of jerseys worn by N.B.A. players outside the United States when there are U.S. companies that have done this work so well and for so long,” Schumer said. “And to do it in this economic climate adds insult to injury.”Schumer said he might ask the N.B.A.’s commissioner, David Stern, to intervene.Donna Wampole, a production supervisor at the factory, said it had already cut workers’ hours by 20 percent because of Adidas’s decision. The nonunion plant made the jerseys worn by Michael Jordan and other members of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team.“I think it’s a horrible thing,” Wampole said. “I think American teams should be wearing American garments made in the United States.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','It’s not easy being green, the heroine of “The Princess and the Frog” discovers. But to judge from how this polished, hand-drawn movie addresses, or rather strenuously avoids, race, it is a lot more difficult to be black, particularly in a Disney animated feature. If you haven’t heard: Disney, the company that immortalized pale pretties like Snow White and the zip-a-dee-doo-dah of plantation living in “Song of the South,” has made a fairy tale about a black heroine, a character whose shoulders and story prove far too slight for all the hopes already weighing her down. It’s no wonder she’s soon jumping into the bayou, green legs and all.But before she leaps, Tiana is just another child of New Orleans. When we first meet her, sometime before World War I, Tiana (initially voiced by Elizabeth Dampier) is keeping company with her mother, a seamstress, Eudora (Oprah Winfrey), who sews princess dresses for Charlotte (initially Breanna Brooks), the pint-size daughter of the richest white man in the Crescent City, Big Daddy LaBouff (John Goodman). Life is more humble back at Tiana’s home, where her own father, James (Terrence Howard, silky as always), an aspiring restaurateur, makes a gumbo that draws neighbors from their homes and, later, he helps tuck her into bed. Wearing work boots and suspenders, his sleeves rolled up, James cautions Tiana that it’s fine to wish upon a star, but that hard work gets the job done.Hard work is a recurrent theme in “Princess,” which the directors John Musker and Ron Clements, who wrote the script with Rob Edwards, further underscore when the adult Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) swans into the Jazz Age. Though the theme certainly serves the story — like her father, Tiana yearns to open a restaurant — it also displaces race, which the film, given the commercial stakes, cannot engage. Hard work separates her from Charlotte (voiced as an adult by Jennifer Cody), not race (or segregation). It drives Tiana, feeding her savings and dreams. “I don’t have time for dancing,” she sings. “This old town can slow me down/people taking the easy way./But I know exactly where I’m going,/I’m getting closer and closer every day.”Hard work, though, also makes the adult Tiana something of a drudge and a bore. Like a lot of classic Disney heroines, Tiana is good and sweet and pretty as a meticulously animated picture, from the top of her sleek chignon down to her high-stepping shoes. Although she can be a whirlwind of activity, as when she balances multiple plates at the cafe where she works double shifts, Tiana doesn’t have the verve of the spunky little girl who bounces through the first few minutes of the movie. What she does have, like most Disney heroines, is a prince charming, Naveen (Bruno Campos), a well-chiseled slab from the fictional kingdom of Maldonia, who rolls into town with a jazzy flourish and a devious manservant, Lawrence (Peter Bartlett).The prince, disappointingly if not surprisingly, becomes not only Tiana’s salvation but also that of the movie, largely by bringing some slapstick comedy and a touch of suspense into the proceedings, along with the expected romance. Though he catches Tiana’s eye (and she his), Naveen is soon set upon by both Charlotte, who’s angling for a match, and Dr. Facilier (a terrific Keith David), a villain who, as is true of many movies, easily steals the show. As thin as an exclamation mark and just as excited, Dr. Facilier wears spats and a top hat emblazoned with a skull and bones. Long, inky shadows follow his every step, sprouting around him like dark thoughts, as in the bravura musical number “Friends on the Other Side.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','That line could almost come from “Troilus and Cressida,” in which the alarums of warfare take a back seat to the story of an ill-fated Trojan romance, depictions of the complex politicking on both sides, and a general fog of skepticism about the objects and ethics of war and the morals of warriors and lovers alike.Mr. Kulick cuts back on the romance: Troilus (Finn Wittrock) and Cressida (Dylan Moore) are in full florid confession when we first meet them, and are parted soon thereafter. Given the alternating flatness and empty histrionics of Mr. Wittrock and Ms. Moore, this is no serious loss.But one misses the savvy machinations of Pandarus, who is excised from the play altogether. The character does, after all, have Shakespeare’s last word, and practically his first. This is surely not accidental, and the absence from the playing field of this wily operator distinctly reduces the play’s deep tincture of skepticism, and cheats us of one of its liveliest characters, too. For cynicism, of course, we still have Thersites, but as played with broad strokes by Steven Rattazzi he’s more of a bellowing clown than an acid-tongued jackal.“Troilus and Cressida” is a naturally disjointed play, hard to categorize and harder to produce effectively. Mr. Kulick’s appendages from Heywood are in a sense less jarring than similar additions would be to most other Shakespeare’s works. But the Heywood scenes that have been tacked on to the end of the play aren’t particularly interesting.And in placing a greater emphasis on the who-did-whats of the war, they can be seen as a fundamental violation of Shakespeare’s intentions. Hard as those may be to discern definitively in this peculiar play, it seems obvious that providing closure was not among them. War, the eternal and ultimate folly of man, has no beginning and no end in the world of “Troilus and Cressida.” With help from Heywood, Mr. Kulick ties things up neatly.Were the actors involved naturally commanding and fluent in the language, the results might not be so draggy. But few make strong impressions. Steven Skybell is among the more distinguished classicists; as the smartly politicking Ulysses he is most impressive, although it is hard to believe Shakespeare’s character would participate in a boast-a-thon to win the armor of slain Achilles, as he does in a late scene from Heywood. Bill Christ has his moments as the dunderheaded Ajax. Elliot Villar’s Hector has a convincing fire in his gut.But for the most part the performers go through the motions of battle and retreat, bicker and boast, with little flair and less fluency. After a while you tire of watching them tromping around the clever sandbox set by Mark Wendland. As they tussle and tumble and fall, I found myself wondering if one of the undocumented agonies of this much-sung siege was the trouble the soldiers had in keeping sand from getting stuck in uncomfortable places. Certainly I don’t recall Homer taking up the subject.Adapted and directed by Brian Kulick from Shakespeare’s “Troilus and Cressida” and Thomas Heywood’s “Iron Age”; sets by Mark Wendland; costumes by Oana Botez-Ban; lighting by Brian H.

"'09-11-25,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook is taking a rudimentary step down the path to becoming a public company.The company said on Tuesday that it was creating a dual-class stock structure for itself, and converting all of its current shares into so-called Class B shares, which will have 10 votes each on matters of corporate governance.Class A shares, which would be sold in an initial public offering, would carry one vote. Facebook said it had “no plans to go public at this time.”In the event Facebook does sell shares, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, would firmly retain control over the company and its board of directors.“We did introduce a dual-class stock structure because existing shareholders wanted to maintain control over voting on certain issues to help ensure the company can continue to focus on the long term to build a great business,” a Facebook spokesman, Larry Yu, said in an e-mailed statement. “This revision to the stock structure should not be construed as a signal the company is planning to go public.”The news of Facebook’s new stock structure was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Such dual-class stock structures — and the controversy they typically generate — are nothing new in the corporate world. Many families and individuals who start companies grant themselves these special voting shares as a way to preserve control of the company while selling shares to the public. The structure is used at The New York Times Company, Ford, Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Visa and EchoStar Communications, among others.Google also employed a dual-class structure when it went public in 2004. Several investors criticized the arrangement, saying that it disenfranchised outside shareholders.'"
"'09-11-25,'1','For Mr. Bruno, who federal prosecutors say improperly mixed his political and business interests and sought to deceive the public about it, golf provided more than just exercise and a chance to unwind. It also assured privacy, hours at a stretch to bond with clients, and the occasional vacation on someone else’s dime.With hardly a day of Mr. Bruno’s corruption trial here passing without some mention of golf, his name can now be added to a list of politicians whose taste for the tees led them to trouble.In June, Salvatore F. DiMasi, a former speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, was indicted on charges that during rounds of golf, he plotted to rig state computer software contracts. This fall, an Indiana congressman, Steve Buyer, came under scrutiny when it was revealed that a charity he established to help teenagers pay for college had spent nothing on scholarships but $260,000 on lavish golf junkets.And the Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff, now serving four years in prison for bribery, fraud and tax evasion, routinely flew members of Congress and other officials to exclusive golf resorts in Scotland, California or the Mariana Islands.“More politicians will succumb to a pricey golf outing than to a sexy woman in a negligee,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “You have a lot more privacy than in your office and in a restaurant, and it’s socially acceptable to leave your office for half the day to play golf.”Mr. Bruno often conducted his business during golf fund-raisers or over a pregame lunch, sometimes at his own club, the Country Club of Troy. On other occasions, his associates would arrange outings where Mr. Bruno could solicit clients.“I think it is really important that you set up some kind of meeting where Joe Bruno can be with the president,” a Wright salesman wrote in a 1995 e-mail message to a hotel union official, urging a meeting between Mr. Bruno and the union’s president during a conference in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. “In addition, I think at this same conference, we try to set up a golf outing where Joe can be with the president.”Several years ago, Mr. Bruno played in a charity tournament at the Niagara Falls Country Club in Lewiston, N.Y. hosted by a local laborers’ union seeking Senate approval for casinos in the area.Before the tournament, a union official, Michael Quarcini, took Mr. Bruno on a helicopter ride above the falls, pointing out what he believed to be the more developed Canadian side, where gambling was already legal.Mark Congi, a former union official now in prison on federal racketeering chargers, testified at Mr. Bruno’s trial about Mr. Quarcini’s discussing the ride at a dinner after the golf tournament.“He told Mr. Bruno that if he didn’t get money for us to fix up the area, he was going to throw him out of the helicopter,” Mr. Congi said. (Mr. Quarcini, who died soon after his 2002 indictment on racketeering charges, was joking — but the casinos were ultimately approved.)In trying to explain why he arranged close to half a million dollars in payments to Mr. Bruno, Jared E. Abbruzzese, the Albany-area entrepreneur who flew with him to Florida, testified that Mr. Bruno used golf to teach him better leadership skills.“When we would be playing golf and talking about these things, what I would be doing, breaking the rules at the club, always on a cellphone at the golf course, yelling and screaming at people,” Mr. Abbruzzese related. “And he would say, ‘Would you stop; that’s not how you lead.’ ”But Mr. Abbruzzese said that he did not get much for his money.“I probably should’ve gotten paid by him,” Mr. Abbruzzese said, “because I was always trying to help his swing.”Mr. Bruno, speaking outside the federal courthouse here last week, admitted to a love for golf but disputed the notion that he used the game to hatch any corrupt schemes.“All of the people that talked about playing golf, if we were on the golf course 10 times in 14 years, that’s probably a lot,” Mr. Bruno said.But even a single game with the senator could be useful, according to prosecutors.In a 2005 e-mail message obtained by prosecutors, an assistant to Senator Bruno asked him whether he wanted to join a golf foursome that his son, Kenneth R. Bruno, a lobbyist, had planned with the Cablevision executive James L. Dolan. Mr. Dolan had hired the younger Mr. Bruno to help block plans to build a stadium on Manhattan’s West Side.“Ken suggests himself and Tim Rooney for the 3rd and 4th players,” Mr. Bruno’s assistant wrote. “I am not sure how this relates to any prohibitions that Ken may have, and I wouldn’t want someone to see you, Ken & Jim Dolan on the golf course and question the ethics of the situation.”Mr. Bruno played in the game. Three months later, opposition in Albany helped doom the stadium project, a major defeat for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.When Mr. Bruno, 80, will play golf next remains to be seen. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in prison.“I haven’t played, by the way, 18 holes this past year,” Mr. Bruno said outside the courthouse, sounding wistful. “Never got to play once.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','The housing market is confronting an abundance of inventory, high unemployment, fearful consumers and devastated family balance sheets.“There is no clear, easy way out for housing,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. “Contrary to my hopes, housing prices and the housing market in general will weaken again.”He forecast a new decline in prices of as much as 10 percent, which he expected to shave a half-point off the nation’s economic output just as it emerges from the recession.In its report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 3.5 percent rate reported last month.The revised number, based on more complete data, was in line with analyst expectations. It was larger than the typical adjustment, underscoring the erratic nature of the recovery. But although growth was slower, the third quarter ended the longest economic contraction since World War II, with the economy expanding for the first time in a year.Little of this recovery is reflected in housing prices, which are limping despite improved sales volume.The Case-Shiller index, which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market, is a three-month moving average. Since July and August were relatively strong, the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices.The Federal Housing Finance Agency uses data from the government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which until recently were limited to loans below $417,000. Its index tends to swing less widely than Case-Shiller.The two housing price reports lag, by a month, the figures on the volume of home resales, which were issued Monday for October. Home resales jumped 10.1 percent to the highest level in two years, better than analysts had expected.Much of the increase was attributed to the $8,000 first-time buyer’s tax credit, which had been set to expire Nov. 30 but has been renewed through spring. Buyers who have already owned a home are now eligible for a $6,500 credit.While brisk sales volume should, in theory, push up prices, Maureen Maitland, the vice president for index services at S.& P., said the oversupply of inventory was acting as a brake. “You can look down the street and have 10 houses to choose from,” she said.About 3.57 million used homes are for sale, a number that has been declining but is still higher than the historic average. It represents seven months of inventory at the current sales rate.Ms. Maitland speculated that the housing market might follow a “W” pattern, as the price lows plumbed last spring are tested again this winter.“There is going to be more moderation and downturn in the coming months,” she said.While that might be good for prospective buyers, it would put more stress on would-be sellers and everyone who looks to his or her house to measure net worth and ability to spend.Consumers are much poorer than they were, and are acting accordingly. Consumer spending in the third quarter increased 2.9 percent, less than the 3.4 percent originally reported.That number worried some economists, who said it was below healthy margins and even lower than growth levels in 1983, when joblessness was as high. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy.Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas, said the revised figures suggested economic renewal would be mild indeed.“It’s going to be a very gradual pace of recovering instead of a roaring return to business as usual,” she said. “The G.D.P. number highlights this recovery is different from prior recoveries.”Also released Tuesday was the S.& P./Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. That index covers a broader segment of the market, about 75 percent, but is released quarterly, rather than monthly.The national index showed an 8.9 percent decline in the third quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2008, a substantial improvement over the 14.7 percent decline in the annual rate of return in the second quarter of 2009.Despite such improvements, it will be a long time under the most favorable circumstances before housing recovers what it lost. The 20-city composite index is off nearly 10 percent in the last year and 29.1 percent since its 2006 peak.Prices in Las Vegas have declined for 37 months and are down more than half from their peak. At the other extreme is Dallas, which did not have much of a boom and thus did not have so far to fall. Prices there are only down about 5 percent.Florida has been ravaged almost as much as Las Vegas. About a quarter of its homeowners with mortgages are late with payments. But even there, some people are still buying.“They’re not buying as investors, they’re buying as homeowners,” said Grant Stern of Morningside Mortgage Corporation in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., near Miami Beach. “Nobody expects a 50 percent gain. Flat is the new up.”One of Mr. Stern’s clients is Howard Roth, who recently moved to Florida from Oakland, Calif., where he lived in an apartment. He closed on a house in Boca Raton on Monday.“I wanted a dog, and a yard for a dog,” Mr. Roth, a 61-year-old retiree, said. The turmoil in the market did not faze him.“America always bounces back,” he said. “Somebody’s got to make a move.”'"
"'09-11-25,'1','A mass prisoner release credited to Hamas could also have far-reaching implications for regional politics and stability, though it is not clear how significant the impact would be.Should there be such a swap, Mr. Netanyahu said, “We will not be sparing with a public discussion.”“We will not do it as a fait accompli. We will allow the cabinet ministers and the public in general to discuss the issue.”The Israeli soldier was seized by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in a cross-border raid in June 2006 and was taken to . He was 19 at the time. Several weeks ago Israel released 20 Palestinian women from its jails in exchange for a videotape of Sergeant Shalit that proved he was alive.The video was seen in Israel as a sign of progress after years of public campaigning and unsuccessful negotiations for his release.Likewise, the prisoner issue is highly emotional for the Palestinians, with tens of thousands having passed through Israeli jails over the past four decades.But the Palestinians are now at a delicate juncture, split between Hamas, which rules Gaza, and the -dominated , whose power is now confined to the .A prisoner release orchestrated by Hamas would very likely pose a new challenge for the Western-backed authority led by President . A deal that includes the release of , a popular Fatah leader, could also shake things up within Fatah.Mr. Barghouti was sentenced by Israel to five life terms in 2004 for involvement in the killing of civilians. A leader of Fatah’s so-called young guard, he is often suggested as a potential successor to Mr. Abbas, who recently declared that he did not intend to run for another term as president.Reflecting the awkwardness that a deal for Sergeant Shalit might pose for the Abbas government, , the Palestinian prime minister and a political independent, made no direct mention of it in a speech on Tuesday at an international conference in the West Bank town of Jericho on the rights of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.Yet he called for the “immediate release” of “pillars” of the prisoner population like Mr. Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, a leader of the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who was convicted of ordering the assassination of an Israeli cabinet minister in 2001. And repeating a point often made by Mr. Abbas, Mr. Fayyad said there would be no final agreement with Israel until all Palestinian prisoners were freed.Ghassan Khatib, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority government, said that the authority “welcomes the release of any prisoner,” but that the emerging deal was “not something to talk about.”“There is a great deal of uncertainty and the negotiations are secret, in addition to the fact that they are not being done by the Palestinian Authority,” he said. He acknowledged that Hamas was bound to gain politically from any such deal.The German foreign minister, , declined to comment on the status of the negotiations during a visit here on Tuesday. “I can simply express the hope that the talks will lead to a good and humane solution,” he said during a stop in the West Bank, according to The Associated Press.Earlier on Tuesday, Israel’s minister of industry and trade, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, told Army Radio that a prisoner exchange deal was “moving toward completion in the very near future.” Mr. Ben-Eliezer was in on a mission to patch up Turkish-Israeli relations, which deteriorated sharply after Israel’s military offensive against Hamas in Gaza last winter.'"

"'09-11-26,'0','BANGKOK (AP) — Samak Sundaravej, a firebrand right-wing politician and television cooking show host who served a brief and tumultuous term last year as prime minister of Thailand, died Tuesday in Bangkok. He was 74.His death, after a long battle with liver cancer, was confirmed by Navachamol Sangkaew, an official at Bumrungrad International Hospital.Mr. Samak had a four-decade political career in which he was associated with military-backed, authoritarian governments. Critics accused him of helping to stir up the bloody lynching of students by anti-Communist vigilantes and the police at Thammasat University in Bangkok in 1976, which led to a military coup.He became prime minister after agreeing to act as a stand-in for Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup and barred from politics. As the proxy for Mr. Thaksin, who was living in exile, Mr. Samak became the focus of street rallies by anti-Thaksin protesters who demanded his resignation.Before being named prime minister Mr. Samak was best known to many Thais for “Tasting and Complaining,” the cooking show he hosted for seven years.Ironically, it was his television job that was his ultimate political undoing: a court ruled in September 2008 that his acceptance of payments for appearing on the program while he was prime minister constituted a conflict of interest. As a result, little more than seven months after Mr. Samak took office, the court removed him.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','BRASÍLIA (Reuters) — The United States risks souring relations with much of Latin America if it recognizes a presidential election in Honduras on Sunday, the foreign policy adviser to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil said in an interview on Wednesday.The de facto leader of Honduras, Roberto Micheletti, has said he hopes the election will end a political crisis that began when soldiers placed President Manuel Zelaya on an airplane and sent him into exile on June 28.The United States, which condemned the coup, has not announced an official position on the election, but American officials have implied that the Obama administration will support the outcome, saying that recognition of the presidential election was not contingent on Mr. Zelaya’s reinstatement.“The United States will become isolated — that is very bad for the United States and its relationship with Latin America,” the Brazilian foreign policy adviser, Marco Aurélio Garcia, said after he had spoken on the telephone to the White House national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones.Mr. Garcia said that “very important countries — the majority in terms of population and political weight — won’t recognize” the results of the election.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuters) — The political party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be barred from legislative elections scheduled for Feb. 28, Haitian election officials said Wednesday.The decision drew immediate criticism from Mr. Aristide, who was a populist hero in Haiti before being ousted in an armed rebellion in 2004. From exile in South Africa, he asked whether Haitian election officials were trying to organize an election or “to make a selection.”Mr. Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, became Haiti’s first freely elected president in 1991 and won a second election in 2000. His Lavalas Family party is still considered the most popular political force in Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation of nine million people.“The Lavalas Family party will not be allowed to participate in the next election, because the electoral council’s legal counsel said the party did not meet all legal requirements,” the electoral council president, Gaillot Dorsinvil, told local radio stations.He did not specify which requirements the party had failed to meet.All but one of the 99 seats in the Parliament’s Chamber of Deputies will be at stake in the February elections, along with one-third of the 30-member Senate. The vote for the one remaining lower house seat will be held later.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','“My mother told me to be quiet about what I did,” Ms. Colvin recalled. “She told me: ‘Let Rosa be the one. White people aren’t going to bother Rosa — her skin is lighter than yours and they like her.’ ”Ms. Colvin said she came to terms with her “raw feelings” a long time ago. “I know in my heart that she was the right person,” she said of Mrs. Parks.Ms. Colvin was riding the bus home from school when the driver demanded that she give up her seat for a middle-age white woman, even though three other seats in the row were empty, one beside Ms. Colvin and two across the aisle.“If she sat down in the same row as me, it meant I was as good as her,” Ms. Colvin said.Two police officers, one of them kicking her, dragged her backward off the bus and handcuffed her, according to the book. On the way to the police station, they took turns trying to guess her bra size.At the time, the arrest was big news. Black leaders, among them Dr. King, jumped at the opportunity to use her case to fight segregation laws in court. “Negro Girl Found Guilty of Segregation Violation” was the headline in The Alabama Journal. The article said that Ms. Colvin, “a bespectacled, studious looking high school student,” accepted the ruling “with the same cool aloofness she had maintained” during the hearing.As chronicled by Mr. Hoose, more than 100 letters of support arrived for Ms. Colvin — sent in care of Mrs. Rosa Parks, secretary of the Montgomery branch of the N.A.A.C.P.But Ms. Colvin was ultimately passed over.“They worried they couldn’t win with her,” Mr. Hoose said in an interview from his home in Portland, Me. “Words like ‘mouthy,’ ‘emotional’ and ‘feisty’ were used to describe her.”Mrs. Parks, on the other hand, was considered “stolid, calm, unflappable,” he said. The final straw: Ms. Colvin became pregnant by a married man.A second Montgomery teenager, Mary Louise Smith, was also arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat — after Ms. Colvin’s arrest but before Ms. Parks’s — and she was also deemed an unsuitable symbol for the movement partly because of rumors that her father had an alcohol problem.Although Ms. Colvin quickly left Montgomery, she returned during the peak of the bus boycott that Mrs. Parks had subsequently sparked, and testified in federal court in Browder v. Gayle, the landmark case that effectively ended bus segregation.“It’s an important reminder that crucial change is often ignited by very plain, unremarkable people who then disappear,” said David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Dr. King.Even Mrs. Parks was forgotten for the better part of 20 years, only re-emerging as a world-famous figure in the early 1970s after magazine articles and attention in several children’s books.Ms. Colvin, who relies on a cane to steady herself, retired in 2004 after 35 years as a nurse’s aide at a Manhattan nursing home. She contributed to her own obscurity: after settling in New York, she never talked about how her arrest helped prompt the famous bus boycott.“She continued to heed her mother’s advice, and worried that drawing attention to herself would result in the loss of her job. “I wasn’t going to take that chance,” she said.So she settled into living an average life. She never married. The son she had in Montgomery died at age 37; a second son is an accountant in Atlanta. She watches television — “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” is a favorite — and is a regular at the diner.Ms. Colvin said she reads two newspapers every day to keep up on current events, chatting about recent Nobel Prize winners. She likes Chris Rock and Alicia Keys. Aretha Franklin could stand to lose a few pounds, but she wore a good hat to President Obama’s inauguration. Don’t get Ms. Colvin started on Sarah Palin.She has fond memories of Dr. King. “He was just an average-looking fellow — it’s not like he was Kobe Bryant or anything,” she said, fluttering her eyelashes. “But when he opened his mouth he was like Charlton Heston playing Moses.”Mr. Hoose said he stumbled across Ms. Colvin’s story while researching a previous book, “We Were There, Too! Young People in U.S. History.” Several sources told him to investigate what had almost become an urban myth: that a teenager had beaten Mrs. Parks to the punch in Montgomery.He eventually tracked down Ms. Colvin, who has an unlisted telephone number. She refused to talk to Mr. Hoose for almost four years.Mr. Hoose won over his reluctant subject over a long lunch at the diner. It was clear, he said, that she yearned to have her story told despite protests to the contrary. “It was easy to find the rebel girl inside of her,” he said.One of her first questions: “Can you get it into schools?”'"
"'09-11-26,'0','But even with high demand and prices to match, many of the producers say they are having trouble making money. That is because the old-time breeds — with names like Black Spanish and Bourbon Red — take longer and cost far more to raise than their modern competition, a turkey breed known as the Broad-Breasted White. Broad-breasted turkeys grow quickly, have lots of white meat and are docile enough that they can easily be mass-produced in large-scale poultry operations.The heritage breeds were popular 100 years ago but almost disappeared until preservationists, sustainable agriculture advocates and food enthusiasts worked to bring them back into vogue. They are generally raised on small farms, allowed to feed on pasture and roam freely. While broad-breasted birds can mature in 14 weeks, heritage birds take 28 weeks.Enthusiasts say they taste better and have firmer, darker meat. But the birds also come with a compelling story that a frozen Butterball can’t match. Breeds from a bygone era, allowed to run free, are promoted as the edible embodiment of older ways of farming and eating — a political statement with a side of cranberry sauce.“The prices seem very high at first, if you compare them to a bird at the supermarket,” said Mark Scherzer, who raised about 95 heritage turkeys this year on his 40-acre farm in Germantown, N.Y. “But when you consider the slaughtering at our scale, you’re paying a premium for that. You’re feeding them organic grain and it takes them more than twice as long to get to market size.”Mr. Scherzer and his partner, Peter Davies, raised their price this year to $10 a pound, from $8.75 last year. Mr. Scherzer said only a few customers balked at the higher price and they had no difficulty selling all their birds. Still, he said, farmers do not make an outsize profit.He and his partner paid $9 each for day-old poults from a hatchery last spring. And on Monday, they trucked the birds to a slaughterhouse that charged $10 a head to kill them. Those costs alone put the cost for each bird well above the retail price of a typical supermarket turkey. That also does not include the expenses of high-end organic feed, labor, overhead and birds lost to illness or predators.“Ten bucks a pound for turkey is a whole bunch of money,” said Ed Di Gangi, who nonetheless was happy to pay $81 for a heritage bird that weighed a bit more than eight pounds. He bought the bird at a Pittsburgh farmers market from Margaret Henry, a farmer from northwest Pennsylvania. “There’s certainly sticker shock, but it’s not something we do all the time,” he said.Mr. Di Gangi, 61, who manages a hospital communications center and lives in suburban Pittsburgh, said that over the last year he had been paying more attention to where his food comes from. With a heritage bird, he feels he will have a healthier meal and support a local organic farmer instead of a commercial turkey mill.But he has had some bemused responses from friends who got free turkeys in supermarket promotions.“There have been a couple of blank stares, a couple of ‘Oh wows’ and a couple of, ‘Why are you doing that?’ ” Mr. Di Gangi said.It is not clear how many heritage birds are sold each year. A conservative estimate, according to some producers, is 20,000 to 30,000 birds. That is a blip compared with the 273 million broad-breasted turkeys produced annually in the United States (46 million of those are eaten on Thanksgiving).Stephanie Turco and her husband, Paul Alward, raised about 400 heritage turkeys last year on their farm in New Paltz, N.Y. But feed costs soared and they had a hard time selling the birds, priced at $7 a pound, at the height of the recession. Renting space at a freezer to store unsold birds increased their costs further. This year, they raised only about 60 birds, selling them for $7.50 a pound.“If we wanted to really make money on them, they should be $12 a pound,” she said. “The question is, does it pay for the farmer to do it?”Frank Reese, a renowned breeder, has helped lead the crusade to save the heritage breeds and works with farmers associated with his Good Shepherd Turkey Ranch in Lindsborg, Kan., to market 9,500 turkeys a year. Most are sold on the Internet, through a company called Heritage Foods USA and shipped to buyers by overnight delivery.Mr. Reese ran into problems this year when the slaughterhouse he had used shut, forcing him to truck his turkeys to Illinois and Ohio for processing, increasing his costs by about 10 percent.“Our turkeys are very expensive, not because of the turkey but because of the processing and shipping,” he said. “The problem is the infrastructure to support truly honest-to-God sustainable agriculture is not there.”Mr. Niman, who has begun breeding birds on his farm in Marin County, Calif., is looking for ways to overcome such obstacles. He envisions building a network of farmers to raise heritage birds, working together to lower the cost of feed, processing and marketing as volume increases.Until then, he said, there are plenty of people “willing to pay $100 for an exceptional turkey that’s more reflective of how things were at one time and it’s supporting traditional agriculture.” He added, “And the birds taste dramatically different.”'"
"'09-11-26,'0','In the energy sector, some corporations have also been vocal in demanding clarity on emissions. James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy, a large power company and a major emitter of carbon dioxide, says that clear rules are needed to ensure that companies relying on coal-fired power plants can finance their transition to lower-carbon fuels, like natural gas or nuclear power. Coal accounts for half of the nation’s electric generation.“A well-designed cap will provide a smooth transition to clean electricity,” Mr. Rogers said in an ad that ran over the summer.Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, “Industry needs certainty, and without a very strong role played by the administration, they are not likely to get it.” She added, “Real leadership from the White House is the only way to get a bill through the Senate, and a bill is how we will get certainty.”Until now, the United States had been the only industrialized economy to shun hard targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The nation has been overtaken by China as the top emitter of carbon dioxide, but Americans are bigger carbon polluters per person than citizens of other countries.The White House said on Wednesday that the president would present a provisional target at the Copenhagen summit meeting on climate next month to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will be “in the range” of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent below by 2050, the White House said.That target reflects the goals specified by legislation that was passed in the House in June. A similar bill is bogged down in the Senate, which would set cuts of 20 percent by 2020.Limiting the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, let alone cutting them, will require a radical transformation of the nation’s energy consumption and fuels that will most likely take decades. It is bound to hurt some energy-intensive businesses, like petroleum refiners and coal-fired power plants, and some manufacturers, while bolstering the development of alternative power industries like solar and wind.To reduce emissions, Congress has been looking at a mechanism called cap and trade, in which legislators would set a limit on the nation’s emissions and it would decline each year. They would also assign pollution permits that companies could then buy and sell depending on their needs.Much of the legislative horse-trading in recent months centered on which sectors of the economy would receive these carbon allowances free, as a subsidy to switch to low-carbon fuels or to invest in carbon-abating technologies, and which industries must pay for them.Corporate America is by no means unanimous in embracing the idea of emission limits. Larger corporations, especially those operating in both the United States and Europe, have gone furthest in tackling their emissions. By contrast, many small businesses and domestic manufacturers have made little headway, and they are worried about the higher energy costs that an attack on global warming would require.Oil producers have opposed the current climate legislation being debated in Congress. Refiners and producers claim the bill would result in higher gasoline bills, lower domestic output and an increase in fuel imports.“In the midst of a severe recession with 10.2 percent national unemployment, our economy, the creation of jobs and consumer impact should take much greater precedence over attempts to impress international bureaucrats during an annual convention,” Charles T. Drevna, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, wrote on a recent blog post, referring to the Copenhagen meeting.Some of the nation’s biggest trade groups, including the powerful United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, have also been fighting the climate legislation through ads and a protracted lobbying battle on Capital Hill.The National Association of Manufacturers said recently that a climate bill would result in job losses and slower economic growth. The Senate bill, it said, represents a “significant technological and economic challenge to manufacturers while resulting in little benefit to the environment.”But the chamber’s attacks against climate policy have also led to a wave of well-publicized resignations from the trade group — by prominent companies like Apple and Nike, and the utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Exelon and PNM Resources. All of them assailed the chamber’s climate policy as counterproductive.“Nike believes that climate change is an urgent issue affecting the world today and that businesses and their representative associations need to take an active role to invest in sustainable business practices and innovative solutions to address the issue,” the company said after quitting the chamber in September.Since coming into office, the Obama administration has encouraged the development of lower-carbon technologies and has sought to increase the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles. Venture capital firms have also been pouring billions of dollars into alternative energy projects, car companies are working on electric vehicles, and some power utilities have welcomed incentives to switch to low-carbon sources of energy.Adam Sieminski, the chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, said that setting a goal was a constructive step, but that much more work remains to map out ways the country can actually meet the president’s target. That includes increasing the use of natural gas to replace coal in the short term, in his view, and adding more nuclear power in the long run.“We have a lot of ideas on the table,” he said. “But no one has actually agreed to the blueprint that would allow us to get to the goal that the president has outlined.”'"
"'09-11-26,'0','France Télécom said Wednesday that it would pay 1.5 billion euros ($2.27 billion) to merge its Swiss subsidiary with Sunrise, Switzerland’s No. 2 operator, in an effort to challenge the state-owned market leader, Swisscom.France Télécom said that it planned to combine Sunrise, which is owned by TDC of Copenhagen, and its Orange Switzerland in a new entity with 3.4 million customers and a 38 percent market share. France Télécom will own 75 percent of the new company, while TDC will retain 25 percent.“This will really provide us with the critical mass we need in the Swiss market,” said Olaf Swantee, the Orange executive vice president in charge of France Télécom’s mobile businesses.The merger is the second deal in three months for France Télécom, which in September announced plans to combine its unprofitable British operator, Orange U.K., with another struggling operator, T-Mobile U.K., in a 50-50 joint venture.In Switzerland, Orange and Sunrise were fighting an uphill battle against Swisscom, which is 57 percent owned by the Swiss government and has 62 percent of the mobile market, according to IE Market Research in Vancouver, Canada.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','And even after such a big stock issue, the trust would control 64 percent of Hershey’s votes. That might still be palatable to the trustees and local grandees who would like to keep a global chocolate powerhouse in Pennsylvania.But a transforming deal that perpetuated the trust’s control should raise a red flag for other shareholders. After all, the trust hasn’t done a great job of safeguarding its interests until now. In 2002, Hershey, with the trust’s backing, rejected an offer worth $45.50 a share from Wm. Wrigley Jr. The stock hasn’t traded at that price for years.That year, the group failed to buy the Adams gum division from Pfizer, leaving it to Cadbury. Just two years ago, it passed up a chance to merge with Cadbury in a deal that arguably would have brought the same strategic benefits as the bid it is contemplating, but without the need to pay a premium.Put it all together, and it’s hard to see why Hershey’s regular investors should back a deal that would pile on leverage of the financial kind but bring them little or none in the boardroom. Cadbury isn’t a sweet enough prize for that.Is General Motors about to pull an Opel on Saab? The sale of Saab, G.M.’s Swedish subsidiary, to Koenigsegg has fallen through, and directors are considering whether to keep it going. There may be some on the Detroit carmaker’s board who believe that G.M. should bring Saab back into its garage, just as the company did this month with Opel, its main European operation. They should resist the temptation.Granted, G.M. is in better shape after its restructuring. But the Motown manufacturer still has more than enough fine-tuning of its own to do. While it managed to generate $3.3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last quarter, many of its plants were idle for much of the summer and huge bills were paid in early July by its bankrupt predecessor.That means it’ll be hard to replicate the performance without an uptick in sales. And G.M. still has to cut more of its staff and dealers. The last thing it needs is the distraction of taking on another struggling niche operation. Opel, it can be argued, was a special case. G.M. was going to keep a third of the European mass-market carmaker anyway and was concerned about sharing technology with prospective buyers, Magna International and, via Sberbank, the Russian carmaker Gaz.That’s not the case with Saab. As sad as it would be for Swedish manufacturing, G.M. should send Saab to the junkyard.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','“Our culture, the whole Arab culture, unfortunately, does not encourage free thinking,” said Madiha el-Safty, a sociology professor at American University in Cairo. “You’re not encouraged to think freely, you’re supposed to be molded into certain forms and frameworks.”In large part because of the emphasis on memorization over critical thinking, many here say, the quality of the education is poor. While countries in the region often spend as much or more than the world average per pupil, the results are frequently far below average.Egypt, for example, once considered the intellectual capital of the Arab world, was recently ranked 124th of 133 countries in the quality of its primary education by the World Economic Forum, based in Switzerland. Other global assessments have provided equally dismal results.“If our education system is solid, but without emphasis on Darwin, it would be O.K.,” said Belal Fadl, a script writer and social commentator. “But our education system doesn’t really teach anything well, not Arabic, not English, nothing.”Indeed, many people, including some of the 150 scientists and scholars in attendance at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina this month, were somewhat surprised that the government even agreed to allow the conference. It was unlike the leadership here to permit public discussion of ideas that challenge religious thinking and the national curriculum, or promote critical thinking, they said.But the government’s acquiescence came in part because of the library itself, a modern reincarnation of an ancient intellectual center that was rebuilt and re-opened in 2001, a one-shot effort to rekindle the kind of scholarship that centuries ago put Egypt at the forefront of science and learning.While defending Darwin, it was this broader theme, the idea of at least listening to new ideas, that the library’s director, Ismail Sergaldin, emphasized in his opening remarks. He pointed to the Koran, which he said emphasized study and scholarship, as well as early Muslim scientists, to make his point. He cited the words of the pioneering 13th-century physician Ibn al-Nafis:“When hearing something unusual, do not pre-emptively reject it, for that would be folly. Indeed, horrible things may be true, and familiar and praised things may prove to be lies. Truth is truth unto itself, not because people say it is.”It was a message that seemed to resonate with the many Egyptian college students in the lecture hall.“I am not against the idea of evolution completely,” said Amr Zeydah, 23, a zoology major at Alexandria University. “I accept the idea partially.”Despite his major, Mr. Zeydah has never studied Darwin, and before the conference knew little about the theory of evolution. He accepted the Islamic account of creation, that God formed Adam from dirt and infused him with a soul.But after taking in the discussion, he said he had worked out a way to reconcile the two: that God created life, which then evolved to suit its environment. “God created Adam at 15 meters tall,” he said, quoting what he said was a Hadith, or saying, of the Prophet Muhammad. “So evolution comes in because we are obviously not that height now.”While some people may chuckle at the notion that man was once of enormous height, the point, some of the speakers here said, was that local sensitivities and beliefs must be understood, too, not dismissed out of hand, if dialogue is to work.“The problem is trying to impose your ideas on others,” said Samy Zalat, professor of biodiversity and former chairman of the department of zoology at Suez Canal University.The British Council framed the conference to seek middle ground, more than to promote confrontation. While challenging a religious society to think seriously about evolution, it emphasized the possibility of reconciling a belief in divine creation with Darwin’s theories of evolution and natural selection. That was a position that many students here said they were comfortable with.“Darwin’s theory of species says nothing about the appearance of life — or about the origins of the universe,” read panel No. 7, in an exhibition on man’s evolution that was displayed during the conference. “It is perfectly plausible to uphold a scientific account of how natural laws allowed the universe and life to develop and to believe that a deity created those laws.”Judging from public comments made during the gathering, the effort to reconcile faith and science left avowed atheists in the audience frustrated and did little to convince the religious fundamentalists.“How did religion start? With myths and traditions and superstitions. That came first and science came later,” said Francisco Diego, a researcher from University College, London. “But there is an explanation for the natural world, whether we like it or not.”Even among those in the middle, the conference did not seem to change minds. “I don’t believe in a common ancestor, but I do believe in evolution,” said Asma Sharaf, 21, a business major.What the conference did seem to do, though, was give Ms. Sharaf a chance to experience the free and open exchange of ideas without fear of reprisal from her teachers, parents or neighbors.“We were taught that Darwin said that man was a descendant from monkeys, that he was wrong, and that was it,” she said.'"

"'09-11-26,'0','A Swiss court on Wednesday granted bail to the filmmaker Roman Polanski, right, who was being detained as he fights extradition to the United States to face sentencing on charges of having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The Swiss Federal Criminal Court granted Mr. Polanski’s appeal against detention in exchange for $4.5 million, along with other guarantees like the surrender of his identity papers to ensure he does not leave the country, the federal tribunal said. The three judges of the court estimated that the bail amount was a substantial portion of Mr. Polanski’s fortune and that given his “advanced age” — he is 76 — the “possibility of reaccumulation of fortune in this amount would not be certain.” The court considered the bail and the supporting measures “as being sufficient to avert the risk of flight,” it said. The Justice Ministry has 10 days to submit an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. If it does not appeal, Mr. Polanski would be allowed to leave his jail cell and remain under house arrest and electronic monitoring at his holiday chalet in the resort of Gstaad.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','But none of this has prevented beer-making enthusiasts from trying their luck. Roughly 450 microbreweries operate in the United States, an increase of almost 25 percent since 2004, according to the Brewers Association, a trade group based in Boulder, Colo. That figure does not include nearly 1,000 brew pubs, which primarily sell the beer they make at their own restaurants.Paul Gatza, the director of the Brewers Association, said that the pace of new microbrewery openings had slowed this year with the recession. Last year, 56 microbreweries were opened, and 10 closed. Three of those that closed had opened in 2008. This year, the association has tracked 25 microbrewery openings and five closings.Even among America’s craft brewers — as aficionados call the independent breweries — some have grown into larger operations. The Brewers Association reclassifies microbreweries that exceed 15,000 barrels of production a year as regional breweries. In this way, nine microbreweries became regional breweries last year.Mr. Welch, who runs his microbrewery from a 7,000-square-foot former filing cabinet factory, described the creative process of making beer as “understanding what people want and matching the reality to that desire.” He has come up with dozens of beer recipes using a wide variety of grains.His approach, which he says is to keep the business as “amorphous” as possible, appears to be working. Mr. Welch says that Sixpoint is on track to sell around 8,000 barrels of beer this year — roughly 10 times what it sold in 2005, its first full year of production.Patrick Rue, who operates the Bruery out of a 10,000-square-foot warehouse in Placentia, Calif., is pursuing a different strategy. Although his microbrewery has been in business only a little more than a year, its Belgian-style beer — which is brewed a few miles from Disneyland — is sold in states as far away as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.“We need to sell a little bit of beer in a lot of places,” Mr. Rue said. “That’s our bridge to survival.”The Bruery, which shipped its first case of beer in May 2008, sold about 1,200 barrels during its first 12 months of production. All of the bottled beer — which accounts for roughly three-quarters of sales — comes in champagne bottles, with prices ranging from $8 to $14. “It’s hard to compete with Sam Adams on price, so you have to be distinctive,” Mr. Rue said.On the other hand, the Mt. Carmel Brewing Company, which is based in Cincinnati, is focusing on its local market, where demand has outstripped the supply this tiny brewery can produce. A recent investment in new equipment has raised the brewery’s annual production to 3,000 barrels from 1,000 barrels.Kathleen and Mike Dewey founded Mt. Carmel Brewing four years ago. Ms. Dewey manages the office and distribution, while her husband is in charge of production. They started the business with a $10,000 family loan, which they supplemented with credit cards while they got their brewery off the ground. At one time they had roughly $40,000 billed to credit cards, all of it for business-related expenses. But they have paid off those cards.Ms. Dewey said that anyone who wanted to start a microbrewery should either have a substantial sum of money to begin with — or a great deal of patience. “It can be very dreamy thinking about starting your own microbrewery,” she said. “But unless you have several million dollars, be prepared for a lot of hard work.”'"
"'09-11-26,'0','The first Self Edge store opened in San Francisco three years ago, when Kiya Babzani, a founder, persuaded a group of Japanese design firms, about 10 in all, to sell their replicas of American vintage outside of Japan.“It’s a very new thing for them to be distributed to the West,” Mr. Babzani said. Well, they didn’t consider what they were doing to be fashion. Iron Heart, for one, is chiefly interested in making jeans for motorcyclists. Another company might be into work shirts, after a Cone Mills model from the ’60s, with a chain-stitch run-off. Either way, Mr. Babzani said, “They’re not interested in any kind of innovation.”Self Edge on Orchard Street has a 10-year lease. On a recent afternoon, Andrew Chen, an owner, was helping a European visitor with a pair of jeans. Asked if the recession had hurt business, Mr. Chen said no. “It helps to carry a product that nobody else has, and it helps to be knowledgeable about it,” he said.Across Orchard, Victor Osborne, a hat maker, took a five-year lease on a storefront, paying only slightly more in rent than he did for a workroom in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If anything, the recession has changed his approach to design.“I was designing for what the department stores wanted,” he said. “It was ‘fill this void, fill this void.’ Now I can merchandise my store the way I want.” Mr. Osborne, whose hats range from neat felt cloches to hip Mao caps, said he receives about five custom orders on weekends, at $250 apiece.“Half the people I’ve met here I used to know on the Lower East Side in the ’80s and ’90s,” said Denise Carbonell one morning in Red Hook, in Brooklyn, as sunlight filled her shop, Metal and Thread, on Van Brunt Street, across from the restaurants Baked and The Good Fork.Here was a woman whose knowledge and disillusionment about fashion — she began her career in 1976 as Perry Ellis’s patternmaker and later had her own label and then a shop for 20 years — seemed to coalesce in the fond, well-chosen contrarian displays of jewelry and wood and metal objects, like forged baskets and beautiful old jackknives.Ms. Carbonell, who owns her building, has been around the retail block too many times to become a proselytizer for the local hand-made movement, though, in fact, that is the sort of thing she sells — and at reasonable prices ($50 for a pair of copper-pipe earrings set with Czech glass). “I think it was just a personal vision of where I wanted to be during the day and how I wanted to live for a while,” she said, adding: “It’s not a shop that makes money or will ever make money. There are people who are drawn to this kind of thing and love the feeling of it, but it’s not the majority.”Maybe, but the stores that have opened in recent months, like JF & Son on Kenmare Street in NoLIta; and Against Nature, a bespoke tailor on Chrystie; and certainly Metal and Thread, suggest a mind-set about fashion that feels less doctrinaire than in the past and, like local cuisine, not beholden to broad trends.Everything at Against Nature, which resembles a shabbily genteel Victorian men’s club, is made in the backroom by the owners: Jake Mueser, 27, and Amber Doyle, 23, who are tailors; Simon Jacobs, 34, a custom-jeans designer; and Ryan Matthew, 29, a jeweler and leather-goods maker. Last Friday, Michael Zucker sat on the store’s Chesterfield sofa with his fiancée, Caitlin DiStefano, a fashion publicist, while Ms. Doyle finished the last adjustments on a gray suit for him. The couple was getting married the next day at the Plaza Hotel.“This is the last place I thought I’d be,” Mr. Zucker, who works in real estate, said almost shyly. “Usually I’m at Barneys. This is something different.”Ms. DiStefano put in, “He’s already looking at swatches for shirts.”The partners pay $3,150 a month for rent, an amount they say they can handle, given the foot traffic and the business they get from referrals. A bespoke suit, which involves three or four fittings, begins at $2,500. A pair of Mr. Jacobs’s jeans costs about $350.And they don’t ask how big the market is for such clothes. They know it’s limited to privileged people who want something a little different. “Right now,” Mr. Mueser said, “any amount of money that keeps this place open and keeps me fed and living is more than enough money to make what I do worthwhile.”Lately he and Ms. Doyle have been working on the design of a floor-length cape for a customer. “It’s so much fun,” she said. “There are no boundaries to these things.”Beyond favorable rents, beyond an interest in traditional things, the new stores say a lot about the fashion world. That there is a disconnect between the customer and the people making clothes. That men have replaced women as informed, upward-moving shoppers. That designers will have to take control of how their clothes are produced.At JF & Son, if you don’t see a washed denim dress or a slouchy pair of corduroys in your size, the owners — Katie King, Jesse Finkelstein and Travis Boyer, all in their 20s — can get it for you in about two weeks. They make everything in a studio in India that Mr. Finkelstein and Ms. King opened about two years ago, selling their clothes at wholesale prices. They also develop fabrics for design houses like Vena Cava and Opening Ceremony.They started the studio, outside New Delhi, mostly out of frustration with the demands of middlemen, including buyers and showroom owners. As Ms. King explained: “Our aesthetic can be a little earthy, but we also have things that are glitzy. When we had a showroom, they were always trying to push us into a category. ‘Are you going to be the next Alexander Wang? The next Vena Cava?’ ” She added: “Once we started the studio, it made a world of difference. We were able to make things we’d never be able to do in New York.”In September, with the help of Mr. Boyer, who helps coordinate textile exhibitions, the partners opened a store, for which they pay $6,500 a month in rent. “Because of the economy, we weren’t sure how people would react to an unknown brand, but it’s been amazing,” Ms. King said. “I’ve forgotten about the recession.”Their clothes are simple and friendly, with a surprising amount of detail for the price. Most garments are under $250. In an e-mail message, Mr. Finkelstein said there was a moral dimension to their strategy: “People want to know how the things they buy are produced, be it children’s toys or food. I think we have a responsibility to our consumers to offer this level of transparency.”Mr. Boyer believes that a store must also clearly relate to some contemporary need. Not long ago he and Ms. King were in a bar in Williamsburg, where, as Mr. Boyer said, “guys had waxed mustaches and were shaking drinks.”“We were kind of critical of that — this over-fetishization of a past that also included racism and denial of women’s rights. We work with a lot of feminist artists and so we have no real reason to want to put a deer head on a wall.”He paused. “Is there not enough momentum behind new ideas? Are people not thinking about the future? Are we going to start walking around with monocles?”AGAINST NATURE 159 Chrystie Street (between Rivington and Delancey Streets); (212) 228-4552.'"
"'09-11-26,'0','“Seven to 10 million iPhone or iTouch users have already downloaded a beauty-related app or indicated they are very interested in doing so. And we’re just starting to see big brands get involved, which will be huge,” said Mr. Verma, citing data his company has collected.Not surprisingly, appearance-oriented apps resonate well with 14- to 17-year-old girls who are experimenting with makeup and flirting with romance. But, Mr. Verma said, there is plenty of growth in the area for women 18 and over.“We’re seeing a lot of single professionals and mothers downloading these apps,” he said.And the market is not women only. For a while this summer, one of the top apps of the game category — competing with popular ones like Farm Frenzy and Surviving High School — was called Sally’s Spa, which puts the user in the unenviable position of having to manage a spa empire with an increasingly demanding and growing client list. The game won rave reviews from YouTube application reviewers, including one who noted it didn’t get to be No. 1 by “being girly.”Apart from beauty apps that fall into the category of entertainment, there is a health element as well. “We see this segment of apps as one of the fastest growing components of the category of health and fitness, too,” Mr. Verma said.While some of the earliest applications offered users the opportunity to replicate the looks of famous faces like Angelina Jolie’s, some recent apps are more utilitarian. They not only allow users to rate their own photographed faces (and compare one’s own score with, say, Megan Fox’s), but also to locate nearby beauty services. They also can offer easy access to tips and tutorials of what to buy when standing in a Sephora with its dizzying array of choices, or how to apply a particular eyeliner.Augmented reality, now a hot trend in tech development, could mean that an app user could virtually explore, say, the newly renovated 25,400-square-foot cosmetics department at Bloomingdale’s flagship store in New York, try on and compare products, get a makeover and advice, and make a purchase all without leaving the couch.“We’re certainly seeing a lot of possibility here,” said Judith Curr, the executive vice president and publisher of Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.Atria chose “Return to Beauty,” by Narine Nikogosian, to release as one of the imprint’s four maiden apps, developed in vook form, a hybrid of video and text.“Women are a perfect target audience for this,” Ms. Curr said. “You could be standing at your kid’s soccer practice, or wherever, and have this useful information at your fingertips.”Increasingly, recognizable beauty brands are entering the market. Carmindy, a makeup artist and a star of “What Not to Wear” on TLC, is coming out with her own app in April to coincide with the publication of her beauty guide, “Crazy Busy Beautiful.”“I want to be right in someone’s purse, right there in the bathroom when she’s getting ready for that power meeting or hot date,” said Carmindy, who is also a creator of Sally Hansen Natural Beauty, a line of beauty products.LÂNCOME and L’Oréal Paris already have apps. And another member of big beauty, Avon, and its little sister brand, mark, entered the apps market this fall with apps packed with custom videos, popping graphics and tightly edited content on the latest fall trends.“We look at it holistically,” said Annemarie Frank, the director of digital and strategic alliances at mark. “We wanted to highlight our fall trends for our target market, who is someone very much living in a digital age. So what better way to deliver to her the hottest trends and how to incorporate them into her own life than on her phone?”While many apps allow users to sample products and create fantasy looks such as punk-style raccoon eyes or bleached spiky hair, some new apps, like iSurgeon, are already raising the ante. Why not see how you would look with plumper lips? Botox injections? A face-lift?“Of course it works off of mathematical principles of beauty and it’s an average of what a procedure would really look like on an individual,” said Dr. Frederick Lukash, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and Manhasset, N.Y. “It could be kind of fun and maybe juice business, but in the end, it’s really just a parlor game.”'"
"'09-11-26,'0','But White House officials acknowledged that those outcomes were uncertain. They will depend in large measure on whether the Democratic sponsors of the legislation can win 60 votes for a measure that is at the moment unpopular and whether major developing nations, notably China and India, deliver credible emissions reduction pledges of their own.Mr. Obama has met over the past two weeks with the leaders of China and India, the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases, to discuss climate change and the Copenhagen conference. American officials said that both countries told the president they would be prepared to announce steps to reduce the rate of growth of emissions if the United States put a pledge on the table.Neither has done so yet, although Chinese officials have hinted that they will announce a near-term target for reducing energy use relative to economic growth, or “carbon intensity,” before the Copenhagen conference opens.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday that Prime Minister would attend the conference.“Obviously, we hope other major economies will put forth ambitious action plans of their own,” , the president’s senior adviser for energy and climate change, said at a White House briefing on Wednesday morning.Mr. Obama, who had not previously committed either to emissions targets or to going to Copenhagen, has been under considerable pressure from other world leaders and environmental advocates to reassert American leadership on climate change.Andreas Carlgren, the Swedish environment minister, said that Mr. Obama had now raised expectations for the , but he expressed a note of disappointment about the timing of his visit. He said he hoped Mr. Obama would come in the final days of negotiations, when dozens of other heads of government were planning to arrive.A White House official said a return trip was “highly unlikely.”It was unclear what effect Mr. Obama’s promise of domestic emissions reductions would have on the slow progress of climate legislation through Congress. Until now, the administration’s negotiators have said they will not get ahead of Congress in making promises in an international forum, but Mr. Obama has now essentially adopted the targets of a climate and energy bill that passed the House in June.The House bill aims at greenhouse gas reductions of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and sharper cuts in the following decades, through a system that includes most of the nation’s major sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Last month, a Senate committee passed a measure calling for a 20 percent cut by 2020, but that is expected to be weakened as the legislation moves through other Senate committees and onto the floor, perhaps next spring.“By putting a serious number for U.S. emission reductions on the table, the president has just called the world’s bet and then raised it for our negotiating partners,” said Representative , co-sponsor of the House legislation.Senator , Democrat of , co-sponsor of the Senate legislation, said he believed that the president’s actions would give a boost to the Copenhagen talks and help move the Senate bill. He called the decision to declare an American target a “game changer,” domestically and internationally.“By announcing a provisional target, contingent on the support of Congress, the president has defined a path to an international agreement that challenges the developed and developing nations to fulfill their obligations,” he said. “It lays the groundwork for a broad political consensus at Copenhagen that will strip climate obstructionists here at home of their most persistent charge, that the United States shouldn’t act if other countries won’t join with us.”But Senator , the Senate’s most outspoken skeptic on climate change, said that Mr. Obama’s public pledge would do little to speed an international agreement and foolishly prejudged the outcome of a Senate debate that had barely started. Mr. Inhofe, Republican of , said that Senate climate legislation was “dying on the vine” and that the Senate would never ratify a treaty that did not require strong emissions reductions from major developing countries.“The has made clear on numerous occasions that unilateral action by the United States is unacceptable, because it will harm our economy and have virtually no effect on climate change,” Mr. Inhofe said.Mr. Obama takes little risk in appearing briefly at the Copenhagen conference because he and other world leaders punctured expectations for the session 10 days ago in a side meeting of leaders of Pacific nations. The leaders agreed that they would work at Copenhagen toward an interim political declaration on climate change that stopped short of a binding international treaty. Delegates are expected to pledge to complete work on a treaty next year.Mr. Obama came to office promising to end eight years of relative inaction on climate change under the Bush administration, but the inaction of Congress has limited the administration’s ability to negotiate with other nations. At the climate conference in 1997, the Clinton administration joined other industrialized nations in pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent by 2012, but Congress refused to ratify the agreement because it made no demands of developing nations.Many foreign leaders, particularly those in European nations that have been more aggressive in dealing with climate change, have become critical of Mr. Obama’s seeming passivity on the issue. The White House appears to hope that the announcement of the targets and the trip to Copenhagen will quiet some of the dissension and help Mr. Obama re-establish American leadership on what he calls one of the signature issues of the time.Mr. Obama said recently that he would attend the session if his presence could help lead to a successful outcome. It is significant that he will appear at the beginning rather than at the end of the 12-day meeting. Most major decisions at such environmental talks come in the closing days.Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations climate directorate, said in an e-mail message that he would like to see the American target in writing and a pledge of money to help poorer nations adapt to a changing climate.“If the president comes in the first week to announce that,” Mr. de Boer said, “it would be a major boost to the conference.”The White House also announced that several cabinet secretaries would speak at the Copenhagen conference: , the administrator; , the secretary of energy; and , the secretary of interior.'"

The report was a welcome sign as the holiday shopping season prepared to move into full swing.Not all the day’s news was promising, however. Orders for expensive manufactured goods dropped 0.6 percent last month, the first decrease since August. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.69 points, or 0.29 percent, to 10,464.40, its second gain this week and its best finish since October 2008.The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 4.98 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,110.63, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.87 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,176.05.Markets in the United States are closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close early on Friday.A. Haag Sherman, chief investment officer at Salient Partners in Houston, said light trading around Thanksgiving indicated that investors should not draw many conclusions about the latest economic data.“The market’s reaction has been kind of a muted,” he said. “You can’t read too much into what the market’s doing today.”The dollar fell against most other major currencies, while gold rose for the ninth consecutive session, advancing $22.40 to settle at $1,191.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Bond prices were mixed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to 100 28/32, pushing its yield down to 3.27 percent from 3.30 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose to 0.05 percent from 0.03 percent.Beyond the increase in consumer spending, earnings from Tiffany & Company increased confidence about consumer spending for the holidays. The jeweler’s third-quarter profit topped expectations, and the company raised its full-year profit forecast. Tiffany rose $2.06, or 4.9 percent, to $43.89.Other luxury names rose, as did most retailers. Saks gained 33 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $6.74, while Nordstrom rose $1.15, or 3.4 percent, to $34.83.The reports came ahead of the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season on Friday.

"'09-11-27,'0','Those markets allow companies to bet on — or, if you prefer, hedge themselves against losses from — changing interest rates and commodity prices. They also allow investors to use credit-default swaps to bet on whether a company will go broke. The administration wants to standardize those products when possible, and force the trading of them onto exchanges when possible.Banks want to whittle away the reforms if they can, and to minimize the roles of the C.F.T.C. and the Securities and Exchange Commission, experienced market regulators who have been generally kept away from over-the-counter derivatives in the past. Instead, the banks would like to leave it to banking regulators to oversee the dealers, something regulators totally failed to do in the past. Unless Mr. Geithner can persuade legislators otherwise, one of the great bank lobbying campaigns will have succeeded, in large part because some companies that buy derivatives from banks have been persuaded that their costs will rise if needed reforms were made.The opposite is probably true. The history of nearly all markets is that customers suffer if dealers are able to keep them ignorant of what is actually going on.Until the beginning of this decade, that was true in the corporate bond market, where actual trades were kept confidential. That made it easy for bond dealers to charge big markups when they sold bonds to customers.After regulators forced timely disclosures, the bid-ask spreads — the difference between what customers paid when they bought bonds and what they could get when selling them — declined significantly. The result was smaller profits for bond dealers, and better returns for bond investors.“It is now time,” Mr. Gensler testified, “to promote similar transparency in the relatively new marketplace” for derivatives traded over the counter.“Lack of regulation in these markets,” he added, “has created significant information deficits.”He listed “information deficits for market participants who cannot observe transactions as they occur and, thus, cannot benefit from the transparent price discovery function of the marketplace; information deficits for the public who cannot see the aggregate scope and scale of the markets; and information deficits for regulators who cannot see and police the markets.”In the listed markets for derivative securities, like futures, there are margins that must be posted every day if markets move against the buyer of the derivative. Corporate customers of over-the-counter derivatives fear that they might face similar margin requirements if their contracts were to be traded on exchanges, and have persuaded some legislators that would be horrible.Of course, because prices aren’t made public, we can only hope that the banks currently are pricing the credit at reasonable levels. The banks say they are. Robert Pickel, the chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, an industry group, assured me this week that “the cost of credit is taken into account in the collateral relationship and in the bid-ask spread.”In layman’s terms, that means that customers with worse credit would face different prices than customers with excellent credit, which Mr. Pickel argued would make price disclosure of limited value.Mr. Gensler, the C.F.T.C. chairman, argues that customers would be better off if the two markets — for the derivatives and for the credit — were separated and had clear pricing. “How else,” he asked in an interview, “can customers know if they are getting fair prices?”Remarkably, big corporations like Boeing, Caterpillar and many others that use derivatives to hedge risk have been persuaded by bankers that they should not worry about that.If over-the-counter derivatives were to be traded on exchanges, or centrally cleared, or subject to margin requirements, a host of corporate trade associations and companies said in a recent letter to legislators, such reforms “would inhibit companies from using these important risk management tools in the course of everyday business operations. These proposals, which would increase business risk and raise costs, are at cross purposes with the goals of lowering systemic risk and promoting economic recovery.”Reflected in that letter is a belief that the banks, in designing and selling derivatives to customers, are acting as trusted advisers, looking out for the best interests of their customers. Every so often, one of these deals blows up and winds up in court. Then the banks argue that they were simply counterparties, with no responsibility for the wisdom, or lack of same, shown by the customers.If, as seems likely, Congress chooses to eliminate or minimize the disclosure of customer trades, and if it allows custom derivatives to remain almost completely opaque and without visible pricing of credit, that will encourage some corporate customers to prefer customized contracts. Such contracts will probably cost them more, but the cost of credit will be hidden, and they may not have to post collateral immediately if they are losing money.For Mr. Geithner, this legislative battle may indicate whether he still has the ability to persuade legislators, or whether he has become the political liability that at least some Republicans think he is. When he ventured to Capitol Hill earlier this month, one congressman suggested he should resign.If Mr. Geithner is vulnerable, it is because the efforts of the administration and the Federal Reserve to save the banking system worked too well. The fears of collapse that were present early this year have faded away, and been replaced by a general feeling of resentment.The banks seem to be on the verge of harnessing that feeling of resentment to preserve a major profit center. In terms of lobbying, it will be a remarkable achievement.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','Bonobos’ other co-founder, Brian Spaly, started making the trousers in 2007, while he and Mr. Dunn were housemates at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Mr. Spaly, a former athlete, could not find pants with both a slim waist and enough room in the rear and thighs.The Bonobos pants, which come in straight leg and boot cut, are best for those with athletic builds, although it is developing pants for slimmer and bigger men.Mr. Dunn is well aware that manufacturers could easily replicate Bonobos pants, so he is trying to distinguish the company with customer service, convenience and technology.Many shoppers still prefer going to stores over shopping online because of the in-person help. But some unlikely online marketers have succeeded, like Zappos.com, the shoe seller that was acquired by Amazon.com for $1.2 billion this month. It offers free shipping both ways, allows returns for a year and answers customers’ questions on the phone and online.Bonobos also offers free shipping both ways along with lifetime returns, and encourages people to buy and return several pairs of pants to find the right fit. Its so-called style ninjas are available by phone, e-mail and, soon, video chat, where they will assess fit and give style advice.A few other online stores also sell men’s pants, with different marketing strategies. One, Cordarounds, is a two-man design shop that makes a rare item: pants made of corduroy with wales that run horizontally, instead of up and down. It manufactures a couple of hundred of each style and then moves on to the next. Another, called Bills Khakis, is more concerned with durability and comfort than the style and fit that Bonobos’ customers seek. It also sells in stores.Bonobos, named after a promiscuous species of primates, is now preparing to pitch the pants to women with advertisements on Web sites including Refinery29.com and Jezebel.com and in magazines like OK! The ads urge women to “give the gift that fits” to husbands, boyfriends, sons and fathers. “Let your man wear the pants this holiday,” proclaims the ad copy in the internally produced campaign.Men are being pitched too. An ad for Bonobos that appears in the November issue of Men’s Journal features a photo of a male from the waist down, modeling pants under the headline, “Here’s your chance to tell women, ‘Hey, my eyes are up here.’ ”The ad, by the New York office of the Gate Worldwide, continues, “When you wear the world’s best-fitting pants, women tend to stare. Even gawk. If you can handle being seen as a sex object, visit bonobos.com and order a pair.”During Bonobos’ first year it advertised only on Facebook, aiming at affluent men in the financial sector; it now casts a wider net. “We have tons of customers who are school teachers, because they have to wear a comfortable nonjean every day, and those finance guys are actually wearing a suit four times a week,” says Scott Peterman, vice president for marketing.One advantage online stores like Bonobos have over those in the mall is the ability to track exactly who buys things, which sizes and styles they prefer and whether they return them.Eventually, shoppers on the Bonobos Web site will have a personalized home page, based on what they like and their size and body type. Bonobos is also planning marketing campaigns that will include surprising pants customers with a free dress shirt.Bonobos, which could bring in $4 million this year, plans to stick to the few types of men’s clothes that have fit problems, a lesson learned the hard way when a swimsuit line sold poorly. Men, it seems, do not have a problem with swimsuits that cling or droop. Bonobos makes shorts and polo shirts and is working on dress shirts that do away with the “muffin top” created by excess fabric around the waist. And it plans to make suits.Bonobos is “crowdsourcing” the design of the dress shirts using TweetSwell, a program for conducting surveys on Twitter, to figure out what people want. This has provoked heated debates over things like whether there should be a placket and whether cuffs should have one button or two. Even men who aren’t sure what a placket is (it is the vertical strip of fabric sewn onto the front of the shirt to reinforce the button holes) seem to care whether or not their shirts have one.Only about 10 percent of men can be classified as fashionistas, said Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at NPD Group, though that is up from 3 percent two decades ago. “I can’t tell you how many times I stop a guy in a store and say something doesn’t fit right, and he says, ‘I don’t care,’ ” Mr. Cohen said. “So he’s got a big hill to climb.”Ray Kramer, 27, a debt researcher at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who calls himself a fashion novice, has already started the uphill trudge. His wife, Dominika Smereczynski, often complained about the way his trousers fit, and was relieved when the seat of his pants tautened, with Bonobos’ help.On a recent morning, Mr. Dunn visited Mr. Kramer’s closet, and took out a pale blue Brooks Brothers dress shirt. “Billowing. Billowing!” he exclaimed. “You should throw this out.” Another, blue with black checks, was deemed as a source of muffin top.Mr. Kramer began to nod. “I see most guys at work, even the skinny guys, with this big puff coming out the back,” he said. “It’s kind of embarrassing, I don’t have shirts that fit well.”Mr. Dunn had succeeded at his goal of giving another guy a fashion complex. “Oh man, we can help him so much,” he said on the way out the door.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','“Dubai was fairly much the worst example of overextension. It had the worst debt per capita in the world by far. I would like to put it down as a really enormous white elephant that doesn’t have much in common with the regular economy of a regular state.”Still, in the mentality of the market, guilt by association can be a powerful force. Referring to the unexpected weakness at Dubai World, Mr. Davidson said, “It will tarnish the reputation of the Gulf region a bit, and it will certainly make investors more bearish again about emerging markets.”Like many Western consumers during the good times, Dubai gorged on debt and borrowed too much to finance a building boom that has gone bust in the downturn. When credit markets froze last year, Dubai, like Iceland, found itself overextended. But Dubai, which has no oil, was backed by its Arab emirate neighbors. At least that is what investors had assumed.The shocking announcement on Wednesday upended the assumption that Dubai would stand behind Dubai World and that other emirates, especially Abu Dhabi, would stand behind Dubai.On Thursday, the first full trading day in Europe since Dubai’s announcement, the FTSE 100 index in London lost 3.18 percent, to close down 170.68 points. The DAX index in Germany fell 3.25 percent and the CAC-40 index in France lost 3.41 percent. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average, was less affected, falling about 0.62 percent. Markets in the United States were closed for Thanksgiving.In separate moves that could portend longer-term instability, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Dubai-based banks with heavy exposure to Dubai World, and the Saudi-backed Gulf International Bank postponed a bond auction that was scheduled to be priced this week.The cost of insuring Dubai’s debt against default quadrupled Thursday.No one could be certain how destabilizing a default by Dubai World would be — banks have not disclosed their exposure to Dubai World’s debt. But concern in global markets ran high. The dollar fell below 85 yen. The dollar also fell against the Swiss franc, a traditional safe haven, until the Swiss National Bank intervened in the market to bolster the American currency.“Investors have gone from getting cozy to a sense of serious concern,” said Saud Masud, head of research at UBS in Dubai.Mr. Masud said negotiators would feel pressure to reach some kind of deal to present to the markets before trading in the region resumes next week after the Eid holiday, because otherwise markets there might fall precipitously too.Dubai, one of the seven members of the United Arab Emirates, said Wednesday that it intended to ask all lenders to Dubai World, the government’s main investment vehicle, and Nakheel, the conglomerate’s property development unit, to sign on to a so-called standstill agreement and extend repayment deadlines until at least the end of May.Foremost on the minds of bondholders was the $3.5 billion sukuk, or Islamic bond, that Dubai World had been expected to redeem in December, one of the largest such financial instruments ever issued. Islamic law prohibits the payment of interest.In Europe, banking stocks fell amid concern that the value of loans to the emirate would have to be written sharply lower. The financial sector declined about 3 percent over all. In London, HSBC Holdings fell 4.3 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland declined 4.2 percent and Barclays fell 3.9 percent. Deutsche Bank lost 4.2 percent in Frankfurt. ING Group fell 5.3 percent in Amsterdam.EADS, the maker of Airbus planes, which has counted Middle Eastern customers among its most resilient, also declined, as did the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy, Daimler and BMW, all of which have substantial sales in the region.Shares of companies in which Gulf investors own big stakes, including the London Stock Exchange, the grocer J Sainsbury and the German carmaker Porsche, also fell sharply on concerns the holdings would be cut to meet obligations at home.Booming services and real estate sectors, a gleaming new airport and a pro-business climate had for years lured businesses, as well as prominent investors, including the soccer star David Beckham.The Dubai government’s total debt is estimated at about $80 billion, of which, Mr. Masud estimated, about two-thirds is held by local investors.Real estate developments for which market values have tumbled have accounted for much of the company’s problems, he said, though “the biggest liabilities for these companies isn’t just the stuff on the balance sheets. It’s the cost of completing the half-finished projects on which the investors have bailed out.”The company did not respond to requests for comment.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','Both men asked that their last names not be used to protect their privacy.The great promise of neuroscience at the end of the last century was that it would revolutionize the treatment of psychiatric problems. But the first real application of advanced brain science is not novel at all. It is a precise, sophisticated version of an old and controversial approach: psychosurgery, in which doctors operate directly on the brain.In the last decade or so, more than 500 people have undergone for problems like , , Tourette’s syndrome, even , most as a part of medical studies. The results have been encouraging, and this year, for the first time since frontal lobotomy fell into disrepute in the 1950s, the approved one of the surgical techniques for some cases of O.C.D.While no more than a few thousand people are impaired enough to meet the strict criteria for the surgery right now, millions more suffering from an array of severe conditions, from depression to obesity, could seek such operations as the techniques become less experimental.But with that hope comes risk. For all the progress that has been made, some and medical ethicists say, doctors still do not know much about the circuits they are tampering with, and the results are unpredictable: some people improve, others feel little or nothing, and an unlucky few actually get worse. In this country, at least one patient was left unable to feed or care for herself after botched surgery.Moreover, demand for the operations is so high that it could tempt less experienced surgeons to offer them, without the oversight or support of research institutions.And if the operations are oversold as a kind of all-purpose cure for emotional problems — which they are not, doctors say — then the great promise could quickly feel like a betrayal.“We have this idea — it’s almost a fetish — that progress is its own justification, that if something is promising, then how can we not rush to relieve suffering?” said Paul Root Wolpe, a medical ethicist at .It was not so long ago, he noted, that doctors considered the frontal lobotomy a major advance — only to learn that the operation left thousands of patients with irreversible brain damage. Many promising medical ideas have run aground, Dr. Wolpe added, “and that’s why we have to move very cautiously.”Dr. Darin D. Dougherty, director of the division of neurotherapeutics at and an associate professor of at Harvard, put it more bluntly. Given the history of failed techniques, like frontal lobotomy, he said, “If this effort somehow goes wrong, it’ll shut down this approach for another hundred years.”Five percent to 15 percent of people given diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder are beyond the reach of any standard treatment. Ross said he was 12 when he noticed that he took longer to wash his hands than most people. Soon he was changing into clean clothes several times a day. Eventually he would barely come out of his room, and when he did, he was careful about what he touched.“It got so bad, I didn’t want any contact with people,” he said. “I couldn’t hug my own parents.”Before turning to writing, Leonard was a healthy, successful businessman. Then he was struck, out of nowhere, with a fear of insects and spiders. He overcame the , only to find himself with a strong aversion to bathing. He stopped washing and could not brush his teeth or shave.“I just looked horrible,” he said. “I had a big, ugly beard. My skin turned black. I was afraid to be seen out in public. I looked like a street person. If you were a policeman, you would have arrested me.”Both tried like , as well as a variety of other medications. They spent many hours in standard psychotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder, gradually becoming exposed to dreaded situations — a moldy shower stall, for instance — and practicing cognitive and relaxation techniques to defuse their anxiety.“It worked for a while for me, but never lasted,” Ross said. “I mean, I just thought my life was over.”But there was one more option, their doctors told them, a last resort. At a handful of medical centers here and abroad, including Harvard, the University of Toronto and the , doctors for years have performed a variety of experimental procedures, most for O.C.D. or depression, each guided by high-resolution imaging technology. The companies that make some of the devices have supported the research, and paid some of the doctors to consult on operations.In one procedure, called a cingulotomy, doctors drill into the skull and thread wires into an area called the anterior cingulate. There they pinpoint and destroy pinches of tissue that lie along a circuit in each hemisphere that connects deeper, emotional centers of the brain to areas of the frontal cortex, where conscious planning is centered.This circuit appears to be hyperactive in people with severe O.C.D., and imaging studies suggest that the surgery quiets that activity. In another operation, called a capsulotomy, surgeons go deeper, into an area called the internal capsule, and burn out spots in a circuit also thought to be overactive.An altogether different approach is called deep brain stimulation, or D.B.S., in which surgeons sink wires into the brain but leave them in place. A pacemaker-like device sends a current to the electrodes, apparently interfering with circuits thought to be hyperactive in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (and also those with severe depression). The current can be turned up, down or off, so deep brain stimulation is adjustable and, to some extent, reversible.In yet another technique, doctors place the patient in an -like machine that sends beams of radiation into the skull. The beams pass through the brain without causing damage, except at the point where they converge. There they burn out spots of tissue from O.C.D.-related circuits, with similar effects as the other operations. This option, called gamma knife surgery, was the one Leonard and Ross settled on.The institutions all have strict ethical screening to select candidates. The disorder must be severe and disabling, and all standard treatments exhausted. The informed-consent documents make clear that the operation is experimental and not guaranteed to succeed.Nor is desperation by itself sufficient to qualify, said Richard Marsland, who oversees the screening process at Butler Hospital in , R.I., which works with surgeons at Rhode Island Hospital, where Leonard and Ross had the operation.“We get hundreds of requests a year and do only one or two,” Mr. Marsland said. “And some of the people we turn down are in bad shape. Still, we stick to the criteria.”For those who have successfully recovered from surgery, this intensive screening seems excessive. “I know why it’s done, but this is an operation that could make the difference between life and death for so many people,” said Gerry Radano, whose book “Contaminated: My Journey Out of ” (Bar-le-Duc Books, 2007), recounts her own suffering and long recovery from surgery. She also has a Web site, , where people from around the world consult with her.But for the doctors running the programs, this screening is crucial. “If patients are poorly selected or not followed well, there’ll be an increasing number of bad outcomes, and the promise of this field will wither away,” said Dr. Ben Greenberg, the psychiatrist in charge of the program at Butler.Dr. Greenberg said about 60 percent of patients who underwent either gamma knife surgery or deep brain stimulation showed significant improvement, and the rest showed little or no improvement. For this article, he agreed to put a reporter in touch with one — Leonard — who did not have a good experience.The true measure of an operation, medical ethicists say, is its overall effect on a person’s life, not only on specific symptoms.In the early days of psychosurgery, after World War II, doctors published scores of papers detailing how lobotomy relieved symptoms of mental distress. In 1949, the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz won the in medicine for inventing the procedure.But careful follow-up painted a darker picture: of people who lost motivation, who developed the helpless indifference dramatized by the post-op rebel McMurphy in Ken Kesey’s novel played by in the 1975 movie.The newer operations pinpoint targets on specific, precisely mapped circuits, whereas the frontal lobotomy amounted to a crude slash into the brain behind the eyes, blindly mangling whatever connections and circuits were in the way. Still, there remain large gaps in doctors’ understanding of the circuits they are operating on.In a paper published last year, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in reported that half the people who had the most commonly offered operations for obsessive-compulsive disorder showed symptoms of apathy and poor self-control for years afterward, despite scoring lower on a measure of O.C.D. severity.“An inherent problem in most research is that innovation is driven by groups that believe in their method, thus introducing bias that is almost impossible to avoid,” Dr. Christian Ruck, the lead author of the paper, wrote in an e-mail message. The institute’s doctors, who burned out significantly more tissue than other centers did, no longer perform the operations, partly, Dr. Ruck said, as a result of his findings.In the , at least one patient has suffered disabling brain damage from an operation for O.C.D. The case led to a $7.5 million judgment in 2002 against the hospital that performed the procedure. (It is no longer offered there.)Most outcomes, whether favorable or not, have had less remarkable immediate results. The brain can take months or even years to fully adjust after the operations. The revelations about the people treated at Karolinska “underscore the importance of face-to-face assessments of adverse symptoms,” Dr. Ruck and his co-authors concluded.Ross said he felt no difference for months after surgery, until the day his brother asked him to play a video game in the basement, and down the stairs he went.“I just felt like doing it,” he said. “I would never have gone down there before.”He said the procedure seemed to give the psychotherapy sessions a chance to work, and last summer he felt comfortable enough to stop them. He now spends his days studying, going to class, playing the odd video game to relax. He has told friends about the operation, he said, “and they’re O.K. with it — they know the story.”Leonard is still struggling, for reasons no one understands. He keeps odd hours, working through most nights and sleeping much of the day. He is not unhappy, he said, but he has the same aversion to washing and still lives like a hermit.“I still don’t know why I’m like this, and I would still try anything that could help,” he said. “But at this point, obviously, I’m skeptical of the efficacy of surgery, at least for me.”Ms. Radano, who wrote the book about her recovery, said the most important thing about the surgery was that it gave people a chance. “That’s all people in this situation want, and I know because I was there,” she said while getting into her car on a recent afternoon.On the passenger seat was a container of decontaminating hand wipes. She pointed and laughed. “See? You’re never completely out.”'"
"'09-11-27,'0','KUNDUZ, Afghanistan  Far from the heartland of the Taliban insurgency in the south, this once peaceful northern province was one place American and Afghan officials thought they did not have to worry about.Afghan officials cut the police force here by a third two years ago and again earlier this year. Security was left to a few thousand German peacekeepers. Only one Afghan logistics battalion was stationed here.But over the last two years the Taliban have steadily staged a resurgence in Kunduz, where they now threaten a vital NATO supply line and employ more sophisticated tactics. In November, residents listened to air raids by NATO forces for five consecutive nights, the first heavy fighting since the Taliban were overthrown eight years ago.The turnabout vividly demonstrates how security has broken down even in unexpected parts of Afghanistan. It also points to the hard choices facing American, NATO and Afghan officials even if President Obama decides to send more soldiers to Afghanistan, as he is expected to announce next week.Even under the most generous deployments now under consideration, relatively few additional troops are expected in the north; most will be directed to the heartland of the Taliban resistance in the south and east.Afghan and international officials say security never had to deteriorate so badly here. The Taliban were a scattered and defeated force in northern Afghanistan, long home to the strongest anti-Taliban resistance, the Northern Alliance.But the government, and American military trainers, failed to remain vigilant to signs of Taliban encroachment, and reduced deployments in the northern provinces in order to bolster other, more volatile regions.The decisions created vulnerabilities as Kunduz became a target with the opening of a new logistics route here for NATO supplies from Russia and Central Asia, over an American-financed bridge that opened in 2007. The route is supposed to serve as a strategic alternative to the treacherous passage through Pakistan, which is regularly attacked by Taliban militants.Now, the Taliban have re-emerged with such force that during the presidential election in August, police officers were fending off attacks on the outskirts of the city of Kunduz, and militants were poised to overrun the center, officials said.“The Taliban were at the door of the city; the people thought the government was at an end,” said a senior security official, who asked not to be named because of the nature of his work.Since then, the threat has been somewhat contained after an operation by NATO and Afghan forces, but the province remains at risk.Residents of Kunduz said they noticed that the Taliban reappeared in numbers in the region in the spring of last year.At just that time, under pressure from the American military in charge of training the Afghan security forces, the government of President Hamid Karzai reduced the number of police officers in Kunduz to just 1,000 from 1,500, officials said. Then, earlier this year, the Interior Ministry ordered 200 police officers from every northern province to help secure the capital, Kabul, which was suffering increasingly serious attacks from insurgents.A district like Khanabad, with a population of 350,000, has just 80 police officers now, the governor of Kunduz, Muhammad Omar, said in an interview. In the district of Chahardara, where hundreds of insurgents are at large, there are only 56 police officers, enough only to guard the district center and the main road.“It deteriorated suddenly,” the governor said. “The first reason is that we have very few police in Kunduz considering the strategic position of our region, and our police are not able to cover the whole region.”In fact, after their defeat in 2001, the Taliban never left the region. The insurgents lay low but remained a menace to be constantly watched, according to the former governor of Kunduz, Gen. Muhammad Daoud, now a deputy interior minister.The Taliban, who are mostly Pashtun, draw natural support through tribal ties with Pashtuns, who make up nearly half of Kunduz’s population. Many of the fighters are local men who fled to Pakistan after 2001 and have returned in the last two years.Central Asian fighters from a group linked to Al Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, who also took refuge in Pakistan have reappeared, Afghan security officials said. Local journalists have seen some of them. The officials, who have captured some of the insurgents, accuse Pakistan’s intelligence agency, Al Qaeda and even Iran of supporting the resurgence. Pakistan and Iran routinely deny supporting the insurgency.Whether it is the influence of foreign fighters, or the growing capability of the Taliban and another regional militant group, Hezb-e-Islami, Western officials say the insurgency in Kunduz has grown more sophisticated, mounting coordinated suicide car bombings and ambushes.“Clearly this year we have seen much better fighters, capable of complex attacks,” said one Western official.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','TORONTO — About 60 members of the hard-line Basij militia force demonstrated Thursday outside a house in Qum, Iran, where the opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi was staying, in an effort to intimidate him before a large opposition rally planned for next month, according to officials in Mr. Karroubi’s party.In an action against another opposition leader, the authorities in Tehran confiscated the Nobel Peace Prize medal of Shirin Ebadi, news reports said.The Tagheer Web site, which is affiliated with Mr. Karroubi’s political party, said that around 1 a.m. Basij militiamen gathered around the house where Mr. Karroubi was staying and chanted slogans against him. The demonstration eventually broke up after police officers appeared, the Web site reported.Mr. Karroubi, who had traveled to Qum, the center of Iran’s religious establishment, to meet with senior Shiite clerics, ran against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 presidential election. He and another candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, have remained outspoken critics of the government, which they accuse of election fraud and violence against opposition figures.They and other reformist figures have repeatedly been the targets of attacks and intimidation by hard-liners in recent months.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','Critics say Mr. Alan is the source and symbol of the club business’s coming of age. If Harvey Milk is the Thomas Jefferson of gay politics in San Francisco, giving eloquent voice to a movement for self-respect and justice, Mr. Alan is an edgier figure, a punk, pierced version of the 1930s labor organizer Harry Bridges, his charisma tied to his sheer force of will and the economic power he represents.In the late 1980s, when Mr. Alan was in his 30s, clubs were the home turf of the expanding gay culture in San Francisco. Many patrons and club owners remember police raids and the condoning of gay bashing that helped to ignite Mr. Milk’s political movement. During that time, Mr. Alan attracted a following by hosting benefit parties for his partner, who was dying of AIDS.During the “nightclub wars” of the 1990s, he was among the promoters and club owners who chafed at the way the Police Department issued permits — not enough, club owners felt — and cracked down on underground clubs — too much, they said.With his parties shut down and their patrons arrested, Mr. Alan sought help. At the time, Bevan Dufty, the supervisor whose district included the largely gay Castro neighborhood, was the city’s director of neighborhood services by day and a party-hearty clubber at night. Mr. Alan came calling. “He was sitting at my desk in ’98, ’99,” Mr. Dufty said, “I was one of the first people to tell him, ‘Look, this is how you go from being an outsider of the system to get to the inside.’ ”In 1999, Mr. Alan formed the Late Nite Coalition to push for a new city commission that would control permitting. The rallies he held attracted a freshly elected supervisor named Mark Leno. Like Mr. Dufty, Mr. Leno was an enthusiastic clubgoer and, in his current capacity as a state senator, he remains a bulldog for entertainment interests.Mr. Leno said, “As someone who has always appreciated the vibrancy of San Francisco’s night life, I felt this natural gravitation” to the rallies.In 2000, a civil grand jury recommended that the police be relieved of permitting powers.Then, in 2002, Supervisor Leno pushed through the board a bill that created the seven-member entertainment commission and gave it the permitting powers formerly held by the Police Department. Members were appointed by the mayor and the board.In 2008, James I. Dudley, a police commander whose former district included most of the clubs, saw the new draft legislation sought by club owners as seeking even more power at police expense.“I was horrified,” Mr. Dudley said. “The first piece took out a lot of our controls for limiting applicants with criminal backgrounds. It opened things up to all entertainment, all hours, 24-7.” The police were given emergency, not supervisory, authority.Club supporters pushed back. Give veteran industry insiders regulatory teeth, they said, and they would make bad operators toe the line more effectively.Over all, that view prevailed with the board.Part of the impetus for the recent change was the appearance of new, more violent club patrons. What had been raucous dance venues in the 1990s were attracting patrons from the blue-collar suburbs and tourists. All were looking for action; a few had guns. According to newspaper reports, there have been more than a dozen shootings and several stabbings near clubs in the past two years.Neighborhood groups were furious at the board’s decision on permitting powers. “The commission has never done anything in the neighborhood’s interest,” said Tom Ferriole, who leads a Nob Hill opposition group. “It just hands out more permits.”Mr. Alan’s muscle is being viewed warily by many who wonder how the commission will use its new power. Asked who gets the credit for the victory at the Board of Supervisors, Jim Meko, a neighborhood representative on the commission said: “It’s the Late Night Coalition. Terrance Alan is the one who pulls all the strings.”Mr. Alan bristles at the suggestion that he is a political puppet master. The criticism, he said, conjures a “script out of Al Capone days with power, money and bribery.”But, he added, “if I have a magic wand, then why don’t we have last call at 4 a.m.?”The commission’s new powers, in theory, give club owners the lucrative right to stay open longer — and make it easier to close clubs. “If we call a club owner in with this new power, trust me, they’ll fall in line,” Mr. Alan said in a long interview on the afternoon he lobbied in City Hall.Mr. Alan’s work is also visible in other arenas. He helps organize Lovefest, the Gay Pride Parade and the Folsom Street Fair.That impresario role, combined with his political heft and his roguish appearance — a row of piercings along the right eyebrow, a shock of red hair, a goatee — gives him an aura of mystery.Exasperated members of community groups believe there are sinister strands to the story of the clubs’ political ascent. Indeed, efforts to find conflicts of interest— like a 5,000-word article on the business connections among club owners published by SF Weekly last summer — have underlined the dual role of three commissioners who own clubs.SF Weekly first reported that the Late Night Coalition had given almost $50,000 to political campaigns since 2000. City records examined by The New York Times show the largesse spread widely; of current elected officials, Supervisor Chris Daly has received the most: $1,500 through recent election cycles.Mr. Alan, in an interview this week, said that city records were incomplete, and that the recipient of most of his largess — as much as $3,200 per election cycle — was Senator Leno.Mr. Alan also said he was working with Mr. Leno to curb the power that the California Alcoholic Beverage Control agency has to close the city’s clubs. He anticipates legislation sponsored by Mr. Leno to create a “citizen’s oversight group” over the A.B.C. to rein in the regulators.“Things are in motion,” he said. “The governor’s race gives us the chance to grab some of the candidates’ attention.”Still, he said: “I have a perfectly clear conscience when it comes to what I do at City Hall. People overestimate my influence.”'"
"'09-11-27,'0','Early in “Ward No. 6,” an updated adaptation of Chekhov’s famous short story set in a Russian provincial mental hospital, the chief doctor, Hobotov (Evgeny Stychkin), leads a documentary film crew through the halls of the shabby institution. In a movie that deliberately blurs the line between fiction and reality, present and past, the sane and the crazy, interviews with actual mental patients (one of whom claims to have killed John Lennon on orders from the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov) are interspersed with actors playing residents speaking Chekhov’s dialogue.One new patient is the hospital’s former chief of staff Dr. Andrey Ragin (Vladimir Ilyin), a stocky, sad-eyed man with a resemblance to Archie Bunker, who huddles under a bathrobe in the men’s dormitory and refuses to speak. The movie, after introducing various characters and relating the history of the institution, a former monastery and later a tuberculosis sanitarium, settles down to tell the story of Ragin’s downfall.“Ward No. 6,” the Russian submission for this year’s foreign-language Academy Award, has a disorienting sense of time. Although set in 2007-8, the movie, which has a scene in contemporary Moscow with traffic jams and naked dancing girls, features Chekhov’s dialogue from the story published in 1892, conjuring a slower-paced late-19th-century life with endless room for philosophic rumination. The juxtaposition seems to imply that below the frantic pace of modern Russian life, the same longing for “the old days” expressed by many of Chekhov’s characters still applies. When Ragin visits Moscow he disdains it as a city of crooks and stays in his hotel room.The quasi-documentary affectations of “Ward No. 6,” directed by Karen Shakhnazarov with Alexander Gornovsky from a screenplay by Alexander Borodyansky and Mr. Shakhnazarov, also include home movies of Ragin filmed by his best friend, Mikhail (Alexander Pankratov-Chyorny). There is no attempt to reconcile the two tones of the film, shown as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s series Celebrating Chekhov: The Drama of Everyday Life.Ragin’s metamorphosis from slovenly, alcoholic doctor and avid bookworm to inmate kept under lock and key (and in one scene tethered to his bed) is hastened by his friendship with Gromov (Alexey Vertkov), a gaunt, brilliant young patient suffering from persecution mania whom Ragin believes to be a prophet. The two engage in intense, lively debates about everything from belief in an afterlife to Ragin’s certainty of the ultimate meaninglessness of life and death. In their most devastating conversation, Gromov, who has had a much harder life than Ragin, accuses the doctor of being spineless and lazy for indulging himself in “the sphere of nonsense.”'"
"'09-11-27,'0','“Fear of sovereign default in the Middle East rattled the markets,” the research director at Forex.com, Jane Foley, said.Banks bore the brunt of the selling in Europe, amid fears of potential exposure to Dubai. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland was down nearly 8 percent, giving it the biggest decline on the FTSE. In Germany, Deutsche Bank was the biggest faller on the DAX in Frankfurt, down around 6 percent.Investors were also keeping a close eye on associated developments in the currency markets after the dollar slid to a new 14-year low of 86.27 yen, while the euro pushed up to a fresh 15-month high of $1.5141.By late afternoon London time, the dollar had recouped some ground and was trading at 86.55 yen, down 0.9 percent on the day, while the euro was 1 percent lower at $1.4988.The continued appreciation in the value of the yen continued to dent Japanese stocks as investors worried that the rising currency would have a detrimental effect on the country’s exports. Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock average fell 58.40 points, or 0.6 percent, to 9,383.24.Kit Juckes, chief economist at ECU Group, said the developments in Dubai and in the currency markets were related as the fall in risk appetite has pushed money into government bonds and into safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc and the yen.This, he said, was “testing the tolerance of central banks to see their currencies cause further damage to their economies.”Already there have been unconfirmed reports that the Swiss National Bank has intervened to buy dollars to prevent the export-sapping appreciation of the Swiss franc.Meanwhile, the Japanese finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, tried to assure the market he was closely monitoring the situation and would “take appropriate steps if foreign exchange rates move abnormally.” But that did little to ease investor worries.Across all markets, there is a growing awareness that investors may use the coming end of the year to lock in whatever profits have been made over the last 12 months.Gold has been one of the biggest high fliers over the last few months, having gained more than 10 percent in November alone. It continued to rise Thursday as investors bought it up as a safe haven.It hit a new record high earlier of $1,196.8 an ounce, before falling back modestly. By late afternoon London time, gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,182.50 an ounce.Earlier in Asia, the Shanghai index tanked 119.19 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 3,170.98, its biggest one-day fall since August 31, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1.8 percent to 22,210.41.Markets on Wall Street will open Friday for a shortened trading session.'"
"'09-11-27,'0','The Chinese propose, by 2020, to reduce so-called carbon intensity — or the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output — by 40 to 45 percent compared with 2005 levels. By that measure, emissions would still increase, though the rate would slow. That falls far short of what many in Europe and other nations had hoped for — an increase in energy efficiency of at least 50 percent.Analysts said the Chinese offer might take some of the pressure off the United States, which is offering to reduce the total tonnage of its greenhouse gas emissions “in the range of” 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. But now China seems to be offering almost no deviation from its business-as-usual path, a more troubling development to some.In a sense, the Chinese offer is less ambitious than the American proposal because China is already well on the way to its target with existing energy efficiency initiatives, while the American offer would require changes in many government policies. American efforts, though, have been mired in Congressional infighting.Yet the offers by the United States and China both amount to politically safe opening bids in what is likely to be a long, tough process of negotiations on concrete steps that the two countries should take to address climate change.How that will play out in Copenhagen, where nations will negotiate terms for a post-2012 treaty on reducing emissions, or in follow-up sessions next year, is unclear.President Obama discussed climate change with Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, when the two met in Beijing on Nov. 16. Officials from the two countries were in talks on the issue under President George W. Bush, but Mr. Obama earlier this year made climate change a top priority in diplomacy between the governments.China’s arguments about balancing environmental concerns with economic growth resonate with other developing countries like India, and both countries propose slowing the growth of emissions relative to the growth of their economies.The target announced Thursday “is not so low that China can get to it easily without actual effort, nor is it too high to believe,” said Jin Jiaman, executive director of the Global Environmental Institute, an advocacy group based in Beijing.China, India and the United States are expected to be crucial players among the 190 or so nations at the meetings in Copenhagen. Leaders have said they do not expect to come to a firm agreement there.The State Council, China’s cabinet, said Thursday that fixing the target for 2020 was a “voluntary action” taken by the Chinese government “based on our own national conditions,” according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Chinese officials also announced Thursday that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would attend the Copenhagen talks.Michael A. Levi, director of the climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations, called the target announcement disappointing because it did not move the country much faster along the path it was already on.“The Department of Energy estimates that existing Chinese policies will already cut carbon intensity by 45 to 46 percent,” Mr. Levi said. “The United States has put an ambitious path for emissions cuts through 2050 on the table. China needs to raise its level of ambition if it is going to match that.” Some environmental advocates have also said that the substance of Mr. Obama’s announcement on Wednesday was weak as well.Ahead of Copenhagen, China has been trying to deflect criticism by showing that it can make commitments to battling climate change. In September, Mr. Hu said at the United Nations that China would slow its emissions growth by 2020, but drew some criticism by not giving a target at the time.Both Washington and Beijing face domestic pressure from business and political constituencies pressing their governments not to make energy and environmental pledges that could limit economic growth during a recession. Members ofCongress made it abundantly clear to the Obama administration thatthey would not approve any treaty that did not include a firm promisefrom major developing countries, particularly China and India, to atleast slow the growth of emissions.Meanwhile, the two countries have come under increasing pressure from European and other nations to bring some sort of commitment to the Copenhagen talks or risk their total collapse. Officials in China and the United States waited until just two weeks before the start of the conference before putting their offers on the table.Some analysts said China might be unwilling to make larger commitments until Congress passed stalled legislation on emissions reduction targets.The figures released by the White House on Wednesday were based on targets specified by legislation that passed the House in June but is stalled in the Senate. Congress has never enacted legislation that includes firm emissions limits or ratified an international global warming agreement with binding targets.“China is in a more comfortable negotiating position,” Yang Ailun, theclimate and energy campaign manager for Greenpeace China, said earlierthis month. “In fact, every country is in a more comfortablenegotiating position than the U.S. right now.”'"
"'09-11-28,'0','In totalitarian regimes, some people take huge risks for the freedom to be themselves; in this democracy, some people take huge risks for the freedom to be someone else — a celebrity.Fame has a spellbinding power in American society, the one thing that can trump wealth, talent, breeding and even elected office. Reality shows and social Web sites like Facebook long ago knocked down the barriers that kept ordinary people trapped in obscurity. And instant renown is nothing if not democratic.Michaele and Tareq Salahi, the couple who sneaked into the Obamas’ first state dinner on Tuesday night, are loopy, through-the-looking-cam versions of those East Germans who tried to climb over the Berlin Wall and flee Communism during the cold war: the odds are bad and the risks are real, even deadly, but a foolhardy few do make it through.The Salahis are now famous, or at least infamous, and they have not yet suffered any serious consequences for their security breach at the dinner in honor of the prime minister of India. The Virginia arrivistes — they promote wine, polo and themselves — had larger ambitions than just meeting and greeting President Obama and Michelle Obama, which they did with impunity, and hobnobbing with the Bidens and Rahm Emanuel. They apparently donned black tie and red and gold sari to raise Mrs. Salahi’s chances of making the final cut for the reality show “The Real Housewives of D.C.” (Camera crews followed the couple this fall but a full cast has not yet been announced.)And in all likelihood, the stunt that drove a dumbfounded Secret Service to apologize, infuriated the Department of Homeland Security and stunned the nation did the trick. Bravo has not yet said it would drop the dashing blond Mrs. Salahi; Larry King has already booked her for his show. The Washington social climbers had a plan, even if it was lunatic and dangerous. So did the father who pretended that his son was trapped in a runaway balloon, and in much the same reality-show fevered way, so did Jon and Kate Gosselin when they ripped their marriage apart on camera.Richard and Mayumi Heene, the parents of Falcon, the so-called Balloon Boy, were not as lucky as the Salahis. They briefly held cable news in their thrall last month, but after the local Colorado sheriff concluded that the 50-mile balloon chase was a fake, Mr. Heene pleaded guilty to a felony charge of falsely influencing the authorities and faces jail time. But even that may turn out to be worth it to the Heenes, amateur storm chasers who appeared twice on ABC’s reality show “Wife Swap.”'"

"'09-11-28,'0','Whether right or wrong, Mr. Sinkinson’s campaign has left The Planet — a weekly already hammered by the recession — gasping for breath. Advertising sales revenue is down some 60 percent from last year, Ms. O’Malley says. In October, the paper trimmed its skeleton crew of full-time reporters to one from three, and has begun a fund-raising drive to keep publishing.Still, she says she has no intention of stopping the publication of submitted letters, citing a commitment to free speech that is a legacy of the city where the Free Speech Movement was born in the 1960s.“I have the old-fashioned basic liberal thing of believing that the remedy for speech you don’t like is more speech,” said Ms. O’Malley, 69, a veteran local journalist who bought the paper in 2002 as a retirement project with her husband, Michael, now 72. “If somebody says something you don’t like, say what you think. And I felt it a privilege here in my middle age to be in a position to make that happen.”The paper has published unpopular opinions on other subjects, including a commentary from a local activist arguing that the murder of four Oakland police officers — none of whom were black — by an African-American parolee in March was “karmic justice” for past police killings of civilians. But such pieces are in a section of the paper that clearly states they “do not necessarily reflect the views of the Daily Planet.”Mr. O’Malley, the paper’s publisher, said he thought The Planet’s critics were confusing letters from unaffiliated writers — the paper says it prints anything that is not libelous or obscene, with a preference for local writers — with official editorial positions.“We publish things from people that we can barely stand to be in the same room with,” he said.In addition to the letter-writing campaign, the paper has faced online criticism from dpwatchdog.com, a site that contains pages of what it calls anti-Semitic writings published in The Planet. The site’s editor, John Gertz, says his goal is not to close the paper, but “reform” it.“The object is not to attack the press,” said Mr. Gertz, the president and chief executive of Zorro Productions, which owns the trademark and copyrights on the Zorro franchise. “The object is to turn the press into something responsible.”Mr. Gertz complains that The Planet does not fact-check reader submissions, something Ms. O’Malley says is well beyond its resources.“We make a serious effort to get most words spelled right in the headlines, which we don’t always achieve,” Ms. O’Malley said. “And we of course never knowingly print something that we know to be untrue. But, frankly, there are things we don’t know.”Mr. Sinkinson, whose company publishes The Bulldog Reporter, a media guide, first took aim at The Planet in March, in a letter to advertisers likening the paper to a “publication that praises the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan.”“In these tough economic times, is it really a good investment to continue advertising in a paper, one of whose main purposes seems to be the defamation of Jews and the state of Israel,” stated the letter, which included a cancellation notice advertisers could send to the paper as well as reader submissions published in The Planet that Mr. Sinkinson described as “hate-speech.” Among those was a letter printed in 2006 from an Iranian student then living in India, Kurosh Arianpour, who suggested that the Jews had brought historical persecution — including that by the Nazis — on themselves.Mr. Arianpour’s letter brought a sharp rebuke from local civic and Jewish leaders, and two weeks later, a published explanation from Ms. O’Malley, who wrote that the letter’s content was “very nasty” and amounted “to untrue racist generalizations of the worst sort.”But, she wrote, “I still don’t think that keeping sentiments like this out of The Daily Planet will make him or people like him go away.”The fight has gotten personal on occasion, with one of Mr. Gertz’s earliest complaints centering on a 2005 letter responding to a letter he had written to The Planet. In that response, a Planet reader said Mr. Gertz wore the “funniest-looking” yarmulke.On his Web site and in a written report he has assembled, Mr. Gertz has called Ms. O’Malley “brutish,” “a second-rate intellect” and “ungifted” and suggested she may have learned what he calls anti-Semitic views while growing up in a largely non-Jewish community in Pasadena, Calif.“It never occurred to me, frankly, till somebody submitted the research to us about her background, to begin to ask the question of, well, ‘Maybe she learned this stuff on her daddy’s knee,’ ” Mr. Gertz said. He also attacked a regular Planet contributor as a Stalinist and called The Planet’s readership “aging radicals” who would be “of only marginal interest to most would-be advertisers.”Wars of words are not uncommon in Berkeley, particularly regarding the Middle East, a contentious topic that the City Council occasionally addresses though it has no sway over foreign policy.Councilman Kriss Worthington, who condemned the Arianpour letter but was still singled out by Mr. Gertz as a “gullible politician,” said he tried about a decade ago to devise a moderate council policy toward Israel. He failed.“It was the only council item I ever wrote that got no support from either side,” Mr. Worthington said.Local Jewish leaders, meanwhile, seem wary of getting involved in the campaign against The Planet. The Anti-Defamation League’s regional director in San Francisco, Jonathan Bernstein, said that while the paper had published some “divisive and hateful” material, Mr. Sinkinson’s and Mr. Gertz’s efforts were their own.“I don’t think anyone in the organized Jewish community is involved in this in any way,” Mr. Bernstein said.Both sides met recently to discuss possible resolutions to their dispute, but it was unclear if progress had been made.Ms. O’Malley said the paper would abide by its mission to publish diverse opinions, trusting what she called “the self-correcting process” of open debate.She also offered a possible two-entity solution to the conflict, saying of her critics, “They could start their own paper.”'"
"'09-11-28,'0','The World Health Organization tried this week to dampen fears about mutations seen in the swine flu virus in several countries, noting that both mutations had been found in very few people.A change that created Tamiflu resistance has been found in about 75 people around the world, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, chief flu adviser to the W.H.O.’s director general. Two clusters, in cancer units at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina and a hospital in Wales, were both among patients whose immune systems had been severely suppressed by cancer treatment; some had had their bone marrow, which produces infection-fighting white blood cells, wiped out so that replacement blood stem cells could be injected.Such patients are more likely to develop resistant viruses when on Tamiflu because they can not clear a virus on their own. But the mutant strain appears not to spread easily in people with normal immunity, like hospital workers.“We don’t know the full answer, but it is more likely that we are not seeing a major shift,” Dr. Fukuda said.Widespread Tamiflu resistance is a serious problem in the seasonal H1N1 virus, but it has not crossed over into the swine H1N1.'"

"'09-11-28,'0','KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — The shuttle Atlantis glided to a flawless landing in Florida on Friday, wrapping up an 11-day space station delivery mission and bringing a flight engineer, Nicole P. Stott, back to Earth after 91 days in space.Dropping out of a clear sky, the shuttle was guided to a tire-smoking touchdown at 9:44 a.m. by the commander, Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines, and the pilot, Capt. Barry E. Wilmore of the Navy, in the final chapter of a 4.4-million-mile voyage that began with blastoff on Nov. 16.“That was a picture-perfect end to a top-fuel mission to the space station,” Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy radioed from mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole.”Launched on Aug. 28 aboard the shuttle Discovery, Ms. Stott made the trip home resting on her back in a recumbent seat on the shuttle Atlantis’s lower deck to ease her readaptation to gravity. She was helped off the orbiter by flight surgeons and was escorted to crew quarters for medical checks and a reunion with her husband and 7-year-old son.Aside from seeing her family, Ms. Stott said her top priorities were consuming pizza and her first soft drink in three months.Ms. Stott, Colonel Hobaugh, Captain Wilmore and the others aboard the Atlantis — Leland D. Melvin; Michael J. Foreman, a retired Navy captain; and Dr. Robert L. Satcher Jr., an orthopedic surgeon with a doctorate in chemical engineering — planned to fly back to Houston on Saturday. Lt. Col. Randolph J. Bresnik of the Marines flew home right away to meet his second child, a baby girl born last Saturday after he made his first spacewalk.The astronauts delivered nearly 15 tons of equipment and spare parts to the International Space Station to protect against failures after the shuttle fleet is retired next fall. They also performed three spacewalks to prepare the outpost for the arrival of a new module on the next shuttle flight, scheduled for February.'"
"'09-11-28,'0','“It looks like pretty good time to be positioning yourself to enter Russia,” said François Heisbourg, special adviser of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. “Gas prices are down, the Russians are desperate for customers and their infrastructure needs are great.”He said the French involvement in the pipelines would give Paris strategic options in the country’s natural gas supply, potentially a wise move in light of Russia’s decision to curb exports via Ukraine.Separately, the French carmaker, Renault, confirmed a rescue plan for the Russian factory that makes Lada cars. The deal will pull the plant back from bankruptcy, but puts off until March questions of future ownership.Renault, a Russian state company and a Moscow investment bank each own 25 percent of the Russian factory, known as Avtovaz. Under the agreement, Moscow will contribute 50 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) to pay down debt, and a regional government will pay the salaries of 14,600 laid-off Avtovaz workers shifted to a new subsidiary.Renault had been pressured by the Russians to invest cash, but avoided doing so. Renault said it would provide Avtovaz the equivalent of 240 million euros ($359 million) in contributions via transfers, production machinery and technological expertise.Igor Sechin, a deputy prime minister, said that Moscow would support Renault’s owning a controlling share but said that the French company had not yet decided if it wanted control. A decision on swapping debt or the value of technical aid for equity will be made in March, Igor Komarov, the president of Avtovaz, said, according to Interfax.The two countries also have projects in mind for cooperation in the nuclear sector, despite the difficulty of talks on the issue, Reuters quoted Mr. Putin as saying.French officials were taken aback by the announcement this year that Siemens of Germany would build nuclear reactors with Rosatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, rather than the French specialist Areva. Siemens sold its stake in Areva this year. Total, the French oil giant, said on Friday that it was expanding cooperation with the Russian state-owned company Zarubezhneft.Total retains a 25 percent stake in the giant Shtokman field, expected to start production in 2014 to 2015, alongside Gazprom and Statoil.'"
"'09-11-28,'0','When Ms. Kyser needed a routine gynecological exam, she called a handful of local doctors, all of whom were charging $200 or more. “There’s no way we could pay that,” Ms. Kyser said. “I had to find another way.”Having seen an ad for PriceDoc.com, a new Web site that lists doctors throughout the country who are willing to post their prices and negotiate with patients, she decided to try it. Ms. Kyser found a nearby clinic where doctors charged only $75 for the exam.“I was a little nervous at first because the price was so cheap, but when I got there, it was wonderful,” Ms. Kyser said. “Everyone was so professional and helpful.”The crucial part of shopping wisely for health care (or anything else for that matter) is comparing prices the way Ms. Kyser did.But that is also where problems arise. Medical pricing is a quagmire, oozing with jargon and current procedural terminology codes. Just look, if you dare, at your latest “explanation of benefits” from your insurer.What’s more, rarely is there one standard price for a medical treatment. Prices vary based on geography and type of provider — whether hospital, stand-alone clinic or any alternative.Then, doctors, hospitals and other providers may negotiate different rates with different insurers. It is not unusual for a provider to have 10 or more different prices for the same procedure, depending on who is paying. Providers often charge a completely different rate for people paying on their own, which is almost always much more expensive than the discounted rate that insurers pay.“It’s a challenge for consumers to sift through these different price structures,” said Ha T. Tu, senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change. And there is no one place to go for good information, she added.Despite the challenges, here are several steps consumers can take to make health care shopping a bit more manageable:CHECK WITH YOUR INSURER Many insurance companies have begun posting provider prices on their Web sites so enrollees can access cost information. These tools allow you to compare prices among network doctors (not all network doctors are paid the same) and check on the price of diagnostic tests and other treatments.“This is especially helpful if you’re in a high-deductible plan,” said Ms. Tu, “because you can see how much you’ll pay out of pocket.”USE THE INTERNET A few Web companies have tried to fill the price information gap online, all with varying approaches.On PriceDoc.com, the site Ms. Kyser used, you plug in your ZIP code to find a list of providers in your area who have posted their prices. You can also plug in the price you’re willing to pay. Providers will then respond if they are willing to accept that price.HealthcareBlueBook.com compiles prices paid for specific treatments and procedures in ZIP codes throughout the country, then lists what the site determines is a range of fair prices. Consumers can then use these ranges as a jumping-off point for negotiating with their providers, said Dr. Jeffrey Rice, the chief executive of the concern.Dr. Rice tells the story of a woman in northern Ohio who had been quoted a price at a local hospital of $2,500 for an M.R.I. of her knee. When she looked up the test on the site, she found the fair price in that area was more like $500.She went back to the hospital where she had been quoted the high price and started asking questions. The clerk told her it would be much less expensive if she went to the clinic down the street instead of the hospital. The woman followed that advice and paid $300 for her M.R.I.Another Web site, OutOfPocket.com, combines price information that users send in to determine a going rate for specific health care costs throughout the country.None of these sites are comprehensive, although all of them are easy to use and are expanding their listings. It’s worth taking a look to see if you can glean any useful information from them.BROWSE STATE DATA If you’re checking out hospitals, you will want to see what information your state government offers. At least 33 states mandate that hospitals make their prices public, Ms. Tu says.But there are caveats. Often, only the most expensive, nondiscounted prices are listed.Moreover, on most sites, costs are not bundled, so you may find the price of a general surgery, for example, but it would not include the surgeon’s or anesthesiologist’s fees.Some states offer more information than others, points out Ms. Tu. Minnesota, for example, uses average prices for some procedures, and New Hampshire and Maine have some bundled prices. To see what information, if any, is available in your state, you can use the links on healthcarebluebook.com.PICK UP THE PHONE “The most important thing to do if you’re looking for price information is call your doctor,” said Jonathan Weiner, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University.“This is still an awkward discussion for most doctors,” Professor Weiner said. “But if you sit down and talk about money, it almost always leads to discounts, particularly for self-paid people.”If your doctor balks at having this conversation, ask to speak to the office worker in charge of billing, who will know the prices your doctor charges and can at least estimate what you will be paying.

"'09-11-28,'0','With the European Union a bigger economic than political force, large countries like France and Germany asserted their power by securing the posts they wanted, analysts said.Other important, but less prized, economic jobs went to smaller nations.Olli Rehn of Finland, who currently serves as enlargement commissioner, will take over economic and monetary affairs, and Karel de Gucht of Belgium, the current commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, will be trade negotiator.Neelie Kroes of the Netherlands, the current competition commissioner, takes charge of telecommunications and the digital economy, and Connie Hedegaard will take the newly created job of commissioner for climate action. Ms. Hedegaard, Denmark’s minister of climate and energy, is hosting hundreds of nations gathering in Copenhagen for 12 days in December for the global climate treaty negotiations.The allocation of portfolios ends days of difficult negotiation between the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, and national capitals.On Friday, Mr. Barroso insisted that he had awarded jobs to individuals, not countries, though he conceded that he had talked to several prime ministers in recent days.“In such a process there is always going to be a dialogue, requests and suggestions that are made,” he said at a news conference in Brussels. “I spoke with many of the commissioners-designate and prime ministers, but the decision is mine.” The result, he said, was a “sound mix of talent, gender and political orientation,” while none of the 13 commissioners who remain in Brussels will keep the same job.The commissioners will face hearings in the European Parliament starting on Jan. 11 and then, if confirmed, begin work in February.The most tense behind-the-scenes negotiations in recent days were over Mr. Barnier’s appointment — Britain lobbied against the inclusion of financial services in his portfolio.Though London lost that battle, it did secure the job of director-general of the internal market — the most senior full-time career official — for a Briton, Jonathan Faull.Last week, Catherine Ashton of Britain, the current trade commissioner, was named the bloc’s new foreign policy chief as well as vice president of the European Commission. That effectively removed Britain from contention for economic posts.Mr. Barnier succeeds Charlie McCreevy of Ireland, whose laissez-faire approach to regulation came under fierce criticism once the financial crisis enveloped the Continent.“It is a change not only of personality but also of philosophy,” said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, an economic research institute. “It goes together with the change of epoch — it all goes in the same direction.”Reaction from the City of London was cool. Lesley McLeod of the British Bankers’ Association said her organization “has seen the appointment and we hope to establish a close working relationship with him as quickly as possible.”Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, said that “the five or six big countries have divided up between each other the important portfolios.”Mr. Barnier, he said, “will probably do the opposite of what Mr. McCreevy did when he came in and called for a regulatory pause.” However, he added that the policy on financial services regulation and financial supervision had been decided, and that Mr. Barnier’s task would be primarily one of implementation.Mr. Lannoo argued that the appointment of Mr. Oettinger made sense because Germany had a clear position on energy issues as well as good lines of communication to Moscow.Energy, which now becomes a department in its own right, has only recently become a significant job within the European Commission, and Mr. Barroso said that there were “probably six or seven” countries that wanted the post.Winning that post serves a double purpose for Berlin because, while important, energy is not one of the dominant positions like competition. That helps Berlin’s case if it wants to make a big push to install the Bundesbank president, Axel Weber, at the head of the European Central Bank when the job comes up in October 2011.Meanwhile, Antonio Tajani of Italy takes charge of industrial policy, and Stefan Fule, Europe minister of the Czech Republic, takes charge of enlargement and policy toward neighboring countries. Sweden’s Europe minister, Cecilia Malmstrom, will be in charge of home affairs, which is being separated from justice and fundamental rights, a post that is going to Viviane Reding of Luxembourg, the current commissioner for telecommunications.'"

"'09-11-28,'0','In totalitarian regimes, some people take huge risks for the freedom to be themselves; in this democracy, some people take huge risks for the freedom to be someone else — a celebrity.Fame has a spellbinding power in American society, the one thing that can trump wealth, talent, breeding and even elected office. Reality shows and social Web sites like Facebook long ago knocked down the barriers that kept ordinary people trapped in obscurity. And instant renown is nothing if not democratic.Michaele and Tareq Salahi, the couple who sneaked into the Obamas’ first state dinner on Tuesday night, are loopy, through-the-looking-cam versions of those East Germans who tried to climb over the Berlin Wall and flee Communism during the cold war: the odds are bad and the risks are real, even deadly, but a foolhardy few do make it through.The Salahis are now famous, or at least infamous, and they have not yet suffered any serious consequences for their security breach at the dinner in honor of the prime minister of India. The Virginia arrivistes — they promote wine, polo and themselves — had larger ambitions than just meeting and greeting President Obama and Michelle Obama, which they did with impunity, and hobnobbing with the Bidens and Rahm Emanuel. They apparently donned black tie and red and gold sari to raise Mrs. Salahi’s chances of making the final cut for the reality show “The Real Housewives of D.C.” (Camera crews followed the couple this fall but a full cast has not yet been announced.)And in all likelihood, the stunt that drove a dumbfounded Secret Service to apologize, infuriated the Department of Homeland Security and stunned the nation did the trick. Bravo has not yet said it would drop the dashing blond Mrs. Salahi; Larry King has already booked her for his show. The Washington social climbers had a plan, even if it was lunatic and dangerous. So did the father who pretended that his son was trapped in a runaway balloon, and in much the same reality-show fevered way, so did Jon and Kate Gosselin when they ripped their marriage apart on camera.Richard and Mayumi Heene, the parents of Falcon, the so-called Balloon Boy, were not as lucky as the Salahis. They briefly held cable news in their thrall last month, but after the local Colorado sheriff concluded that the 50-mile balloon chase was a fake, Mr. Heene pleaded guilty to a felony charge of falsely influencing the authorities and faces jail time. But even that may turn out to be worth it to the Heenes, amateur storm chasers who appeared twice on ABC’s reality show “Wife Swap.”'"

"'09-11-29,'0','Beyond that, why is the wealth accumulated by those families more deserving of protection from tax than estates built through savings and investment?The writer is a trusts and estates lawyer.Apparently, tired arguments never die. In this case, the argument in question is Ray D. Madoff’s contention that family farms and small businesses need further protection from the estate tax beyond the current $3.5 million exemption.As an initial matter, I disagree with what Ms. Madoff considers “small.” The fear of the estate tax among small-business owners, real as it may be, is based on ignorance and political propaganda — not the empirical data. After practicing estate planning for more than a decade, I can attest that I have yet to see a family farm or a small business go under because of the estate tax.What Ms. Madoff didn’t mention is that under the current law, if a family business interest does make up a significant portion of the taxable estate, the heirs have 15 years to pay the estate tax attributable to it. Of course, the family has to hold on to the business to qualify for this deferral (as well as Ms. Madoff’s proposed $10 million small-business exemption). And that is the real issue.In my experience, the family business fails upon the death of the patriarch or matriarch because of the family. Spouses from a second marriage do not get along with the children. Children do not get along with one another. And when nobody plans for the inevitable, the business suffers from a lack of unified management and is often split into pieces.The irony is that, as a consequence of the rapid increase in the estate tax exemption over the last 15 years, more and more families have come to disregard the need for business succession planning. Increasing the exemption for “small” businesses is not only unnecessary, but also would probably worsen the situation.The federal estate tax is often a form of double taxation. Inherited wealth is not free of income taxes, contrary to the suggestion by Ray D. Madoff. Earned income and already taxed property have been subject to income taxes. Built-in gains on property, on the other hand, have not been subject to tax.Ms. Madoff proposes to tax every “heiress” at 55 percent and provide a meager exclusion of $1 million to $2 million. In high-cost states like New York, the frugal employee and the self-employed professional would get slaughtered. What happens after an owner sells the family business: is the family money now in the hands of an “heiress”?The proposal would also create a perverse incentive to start businesses to take advantage of the larger $10 million exclusion. Ms. Madoff’s dichotomy might sound good, but it is a false dichotomy between good and bad wealth.The writers are, respectively, a lawyer who is the author of Future of the Federal Estate Tax Blog, and a benefits professional.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','“You have an opportunity to change rumor and innuendo into truth. Moving past fear and doubt — that’s something they did not do well during the first 24 hours.”But now even the authorities will apparently have to wait at least another day to hear from Woods, who is not required to speak with them. An interview on Sunday could determine whether charges will be filed. Among the unanswered questions are why Woods was leaving his home at that late hour and where he was going, the circumstances of his wife’s presence at the scene, and how he sustained his injuries.“This is still an ongoing crash investigation,” Sgt. Kim Montes, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said Saturday afternoon in a statement. Earlier, in an e-mail message, Montes said: “We will not be addressing any rumors or other scenarios. If our investigation takes us in a different direction, we will let the media know.”Woods, 33, was lying on the street unconscious near his vehicle for nearly five minutes, according to an incident report released by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which received the initial 911 call from a resident of the gated community of Isleworth, an Orlando suburb where several high-profile athletes live.Woods and his 29-year-old wife of five years have two children, Sam Alexis, 2, and Charlie Axel, born in February. The couple married in October 2004.Much of the speculation in the news media about the cause and nature of the incident stemmed from reports from the Windermere, Fla., police chief, Daniel Saylor, who said Friday that Woods’s wife used a golf club to break the rear window of the S.U.V. to help extricate Woods.Saylor told reporters that when officers arrived on the scene, Woods was “drifting out of consciousness.” He was taken to the hospital 23 minutes after officers from the sheriff’s office arrived and was later released.The Orlando Sentinel reported Saturday on its Web site that the highway patrol said Woods’s car sustained $5,000 to $8,000 worth of damage to the front bumper and grille, and that the airbags did not deploy.The highway patrol said alcohol was not a factor.Montes said the highway patrol had not yet reviewed a tape of a 911 call provided by the sheriff’s office and that there was no timeline for its release. The sheriff’s office did, however, release a copy of the dispatch report on its Web site.Experts said Woods might have to step outside the cocoon in which his private life is usually wrapped in order to take control of the story. The longer he waits to address the news media about the accident, the greater the possibility that his reputation could suffer, they said.Referring to the private lives of public figures, Rosner said, “They don’t need to tell everybody everything at every time, but because of what has transpired and the different reports that have come in, I think it is essential for him to address it within the next 24 hours.”Regardless of when Woods chooses to address the incident publicly, he will have a chance to do so Tuesday at a previously scheduled news conference at the Chevron World Challenge, a tournament he is hosting at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif.Paul said that even if Woods waited until then, he must still address the subject.“You’ve got major sponsors, you’ve got a major investment in it yourself, and the best way to protect them right now is to be there to answer the questions,” Paul said. “You don’t want to be seen as lying and you don’t want to be seen as avoiding.”Investigators are almost certain to ask for an explanation of the details reported by the police who arrived at Woods’s house.On Friday, Saylor of the Windermere police said in a briefing that officers found Woods lying in the street with his wife standing over him “frantic, upset.”According to information from the dispatchers, and released by the sheriff’s office, Woods was lying on the street unconscious at 2:29:20 a.m. At 2:33:49, the dispatcher reported that the “male is breathing.”Saylor said Friday that Woods sustained cuts to his upper and lower lips and that there was blood in his mouth. Saylor said Woods was treated on scene for 10 minutes. The dispatch report shows that at 2:52 a.m., Woods was transported to Health Central Hospital in Ocoee. He was treated and released Friday in good condition, a spokesman for Woods said.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','The top 30 players in the world can earn good livings. But it is considerably more difficult for the players ranked just below them. Their appearance fees are lower, and they rarely are invited to the tournaments that offer the best prize money.For these players, the World Chess Cup now being held in Khanty Mansiysk, Russia, is a great opportunity. With a field of 128 and prize money totaling $1.6 million — with $120,000 going to the winner — the tournament is giving some second-tier players a chance to compete against the elite, and perhaps to join them. The winner also will be seeded into the candidates’ matches for the world championship.The highest-ranked players in the World Cup are certainly favorites, but it is a long tournament (the champion has to win seven matches). In the last World Cup, two years ago, Gata Kamsky of the United States was the No. 11 seed, but he won. Ranked No. 27 this year, he sailed through the first two rounds, but other high-ranked players were not so fortunate.They included Sergei Movsesian of Slovakia (No. 16), who lost in Round 1 to Yu Yangyi of China (No. 113). Round 2 was more surprising: Alexander Morozevich of Russia (No. 4), Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan (No. 5) and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine (No. 6) lost, respectively, to Viktor Laznicka of the Czech Republic (No. 61), Konstantin Sakaev of Russia (No. 69) and Wesley So of the Philippines (No. 59).Laznicka won both games against Morozevich. In Game 1, Morozevich tried to create an unbalanced position in which he could thrive, but Laznicka outplayed him.Morozevich chose 5 Nc6, which is rarer than 5 Be3 because Black often has no trouble gaining equality. White’s 7 Nc3 is more unusual because it allows Black to double White’s pawns with 7 ... Qf3; 7 Nd2 is usually played.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','The South African players opposed apartheid but took different approaches to representing what had become a pariah state.Cliff Drysdale, who was the top-ranked South African player in 1974 and is now a tennis commentator for ESPN, publicly opposed apartheid, left the team and renounced his South African citizenship after playing one Davis Cup match in 1974.Drysdale said that he grew tired of representing a country whose government had become “increasingly unacceptable to the whole world.” (In a notable example, South Africa was barred from the Olympics from 1964 until 1992.) Drysdale said he had begun to feel like an “unwelcomed guest” at tournaments around the globe. “I just had had enough of it,” he said.Moore was a vocal critic of the apartheid regime, while Hewitt and his doubles partner, Frew McMillan, did not comment publicly on the issue.“I could understand the nature of governments opposing the politics of South Africa, which I opposed myself, but I was not a political animal, I was a sporting beast,” McMillan said.While the rising tide of condemnation for South Africa’s minority-rule government complicated the team’s surprising run to the Davis Cup final, India’s path there included more on-court drama. After upsetting the defending champion, Australia, in an epic confrontation that set a record for games played, 327, India still had the Soviet Union standing in the way of a trip to the final.The team was led by Vijay and Anand Amritraj, who were brothers and rivals.“I was always better than Vijay growing up,” said Anand Amritraj, who was two years older. “Then in ’73, he had a breakout year, and I was left in the dust.”With India leading the Soviet Union after the doubles, 2-1, Anand Amritraj clinched a berth in the final with a rousing five-set win over Teimuraz Kakulia.“It was two brothers taking their country to the final, which had never happened, and this was for a billion people,” Vijay Amritraj said. “It was past the goose-bump feeling.”India’s celebration proved short-lived. South Africa defeated Italy to reach the final, and after weeks of speculation that a compromise might be reached to play at a neutral site, the Indian government decided to boycott the final. The decision, which most believe came from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, ceded the Cup to South Africa and came as a crushing disappointment for the players on both teams.The boycott did spare the South African officials that ran Ellis Park in Johannesburg, which was scheduled to host the matches, from having to accommodate Indian fans.“The crowd at Ellis Park would have been segregated with just a very small section near the top reserved for nonwhites,” said Sy Lerman, who covered the Davis Cup in 1974 for The Daily Mail in Johannesburg.Would South African officials have allowed Indian fans to sit among whites, or might they have relegated friends of the Indian team to the nonwhite section? “That would have been a ludicrous chance for us to take,” Vijay Amritraj said.The passage of time has not produced a consensus on whether the boycott was justified.“At the end of the day, the Indian government was right,” Moore said. “If more countries had boycotted South Africa, maybe apartheid would have crashed down sooner.”McMillan, who lives in England, maintained that sports should be separated from politics. “If we had played, they might have seen that we weren’t as bad as some people thought,” he said. “I would like to think that they took the worst course of action.”The Indian team is no less divided.“I think it was a bad call,” Anand Amritraj said. “The only time we had an excellent chance of winning the Davis Cup, we gave it away.”But Vijay Amritraj contended that the Indian government made the right move. “As a sportsman I was disappointed, but as an individual I took pride in the fact that my government made the right call,” he said.Each side remains convinced that it would have won.“I felt then and I feel now that we would absolutely have beaten them,” said Moore, who lives in California and is a director of the Indian Wells tennis tournament. Anand Amritraj, who owns a tennis club in Bayshore, N.Y., disagreed, saying: “I think they’re definitely delusional. We would have won, 4-1.”During a Davis Cup tie with India in 1967, Hewitt broke his leg late in the final set of a doubles match with McMillan but finished and won the match in South Africa’s 5-0 victory.In September, India and South Africa met in Davis Cup play in Johannesburg — India won their World Group playoff tie, 4-1 — but the lost Davis Cup meeting is viewed as a missed opportunity by the men who would have played. South Africa never made it to another final, and India still has not won the Cup.'"

"'09-11-29,'0','WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board warned bluntly on Saturday that provisions in financial legislation before the House and Senate would “seriously impair” the Fed as it struggled to maintain financial and economic stability.In a column published on The Washington Post’s Web site and scheduled to appear on the op-ed page on Sunday, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, sharply criticized a Senate provision that he said “would strip the Fed of all its bank regulatory powers” and a House provision to repeal a 30-year-old law “to protect monetary policy from short-term political influence.”The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction to regulate banks has come under increasing attack in Congress in recent months, reflecting the anger of voters at the huge taxpayer costs of the bailout of Wall Street.Mr. Bernanke repeated, as he has many times before, that while some of the measures in response to the financial crisis were “distasteful and unfair,” they were necessary.The White House and senior Democratic lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have proposed eliminating the Fed’s current role of setting the rules for products like mortgages and credit cards. Instead, officials have proposed a new federal consumer financial protection agency to both set and enforce rules over such products.The op-ed article was part of Mr. Bernanke’s running campaign to preserve the Fed’s powers and independence as the system of financial regulation is overhauled. In the past, it would have been unusual for a Fed chairman to make such pointed remarks in a public forum, but Mr. Bernanke has been more outspoken than most.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','I’ve danced all over the world, and people are people. We cannot cut off from each other in life. In order to lead, you can’t do that.Q. How do you interview dancers, and others who work for Ailey?A. When they come to my office, I say: “Hi, how are you? What do you want this job for? Why are you here? Do you know how hard this is?”’ And half the time I’m just trying to get an expression out of their faces.I ask everybody why they’re here, especially dancers. And the people who give the greatest answers are the ones who understand that this is not just some dance school or some big organization that was founded 51 years ago. There’s a sense that you’re entering another world. You’re going to have your vulnerability tapped into, and nobody’s going to laugh at you. You will be honored for being who you are.Q. How do you foster that?A. You have to reinforce it every now and then, but they know, they know. The reason I hired them is their extreme individuality and uniqueness, and their willingness to be able to work as a group.Q. How do you get a sense of that from somebody?A. You don’t until they’re in the company for the first year and then the second year. The second year is always the telltale in Ailey Company. If you can get through that second year, you can get through anything.Q. What is it about the second year?A. Concert dance is the hardest kind of dance. We tour constantly, around the world, year in and year out. It just doesn’t work for everybody. It’s the lifestyle, it’s the stamina, it’s the love, it’s the dedication, it’s the commitment, it’s all those words. You must retain your love of what you’re doing and understand why you’re doing it.Why am I doing this? Why am I bending over and kissing my knees every morning, and know that every day of my life until I die, I have to take class. That’s even if you become an architect, a nurse, anything. You still have to take classes. Strive for perfection. Nobody’s going to be perfect on this earth. But strive for perfection.Q. Do you ever have dancers who don’t work well within the group?A. Dissension is like luggage that you’re trying to carry around while you’re out there doing a revelation. How do you do that? You can’t. You have to dance unencumbered. There’s no other way to move. The idea of dance is freedom. It is not exclusiveness, it’s inclusiveness.A. I don’t think of myself as a leader. I am, but I don’t think of myself that way. I’m not trying to belittle what I do, but I think of myself as a dancer first. I’ll always be a dancer. Even if I can’t dance in front of you, I’ll always be dancing. I think of myself as a person who can seem intimidating until I break out my grin and then you realize, “Oh, yes, it’s her. Yeah, we know her.”A. When you’re dealing with numbers, see the people behind those numbers, and understand that they’re just like you. You just happen to have a degree in business and you could be very, very smart. But they might be smart in other ways that you aren’t. And give people full credit for being who they are. It’s so important to remember that.And it starts with, “Hello, how are you?” and listening.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','Instead, Iraqis treat their Constitution — like the benchmarks — the way they treat what few traffic lights operate here.“So what?” a Kurdish lawmaker, Mahmoud Othman, said when asked about the risk of holding the election later than the Constitution demands. “Nothing in Iraq is very legitimate.”As a matter of policy, there’s nothing wrong with prodding Iraq or Afghanistan toward reforms aimed at creating stable democratic government. Achieving them could hasten the withdrawal of American troops, which is clearly on Mr. Obama’s mind. Once Americans set a timetable to do so, however — as Mr. Obama is now under pressure to do for Afghanistan — momentum has a way of evaporating.“It is time for us to transition to the Iraqis,” Mr. Obama said when he last visited Iraq. “They need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty. And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations.”But that was seven months ago, and little has changed. In fact, the coming election has paralyzed Iraq’s lawmakers because they seem less interested in accommodation than in jockeying for best advantage out of the rapidly changing rules that will govern the vote.The postponing of a planned census — another unmet constitutional requirement — means that no one can even agree how many voters each lawmaker should represent or how seats should be apportioned. The Iraqis raised the number of seats in Parliament to 323 anyway, based on little more than a guess that Iraq’s population has grown to 32 million, from 27 million.“It’s important to recognize how this kind of general constitutional and political immaturity is continuing to hamper progress in the Iraqi democracy,” said Reider Visser, an Iraq expert at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.Despite campaign oratory about reaching across sectarian and ethnic lines, the fight over the election has broken along those very lines. One of Iraq’s vice presidents, Tariq al-Hashimi, vetoed a much-delayed election law last month on grounds that the vote wouldn’t fairly represent Iraqis living abroad, most of them Sunnis.Mr. Hashimi, a Sunni who told me not long ago that Iraq was now ready for historic reconciliation, was widely accused of acting in a purely sectarian way to ensure more votes for his bloc. The Parliament’s Shiite and Kurdish blocs promptly joined forces in last week’s session and, despite intense American lobbying, passed yet another election law that would reduce Sunni seats even more.If there’s good news in Iraq’s election impasse, it’s that the conflict is still a political one. So far. The bad news is that politics in Iraq remain rooted in passions that turned violent the last time Iraq held a national election, in 2005.“The election impasse demonstrates that the Sunni Arabs have not fundamentally reconciled themselves to their reduced stature in Iraq’s power structure,” Kenneth Katzman, an analyst at the Congressional Research Service in Washington, wrote in an e-mail message.The new election was supposed to ameliorate Sunni grievances; now it threatens to revive the Sunnis’ sense of disenfranchisement and, perhaps, drive some back into the insurgency.“It is highly likely that many Sunni Arabs will revert to the use of violence if they do not get what they perceive is their fair share of power and resources by participating in the legitimate political process,” Mr. Katzman wrote.While that may seem pessimistic after the security successes of the last two years, a wealth of recent history shows that there is nothing inevitable about democratic transition.The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in democracy from Eastern Europe to the Pacific — only to see the tide ebb as political leaders reverted to old instincts. Russia, Belarus and the Central Asian republics became authoritarian. Georgia splintered. Ukraine’s Orange Revolution in 2005 has degenerated into an ethnically tinged political paralysis not unlike Iraq’s.“Democracy, as I understand it, is not like a vehicle or a car,” Sami al-Askari, a senior member of Parliament close to Prime MinisterNuri Kamal al-Maliki, said. “Just buy a Mercedes or a B.M.W. and everyone can drive it, whether he is from Russia or Iraq. Democracy is a culture, based on culture, and culture needs time.”“America’s Role in Nation-Building,” a book by the RAND Corporation published shortly after the American invasion in 2003, said as much.Reviewing examples from Germany and Japan to Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, the authors wrote, “The record suggests that, while staying long does not guarantee success, leaving early ensures failure.”But now the window for the United States to nurture Iraq’s democratic institutions — the Parliament, government ministries, political parties, independent courts — as the route for resolving disputes is rapidly closing. Mr. Obama has ordered the last combat troops out by August; a security agreement between Iraq and the United States says all must be out when 2011 ends. American influence is already waning.When the American ambassador,Christopher R. Hill, went to Parliament on Sunday to lobby for a resolution over the election law, some deputies demanded he be barred from the building.'"

Although he had been in 15 cities in two weeks, he had nowhere to go on this day but offered to meet at an airport because I had a flight, and he likes airports just fine. Loves them, in fact.“I’m very at home here. Look, I get to see a plane take off over your shoulders every few minutes, which is always exciting for me,” he said, gesturing to the tarmac as we settle in to a booth at T.G.I. Friday’s. “It would be fine for me to sit down at the bar, approach anyone here and talk to them about stuff and learn about their lives. The rest of the world turns off, no one expects anything of you, and I talk to strangers, I learn about lives I would never otherwise know about.”That may sound a bit affected, a postmodern accommodation of a peripatetic existence, but Mr. Reitman looks at home in the booth even though he grew up in and around Los Angeles as the son of the Hollywood director and producer Ivan Reitman, who is a producer on the film and whose company put up half of the $25 million budget.“All the airports kind of feel and look the same now,” Mr. Reitman said, grabbing one of the small burgers in the middle of the table. “Some are more beautiful, some are less beautiful, but for the most part you’re going to find a Starbucks in every airport. You’re going to get your coffee and the USA Today or New York Times in every airport. All the things that you want are there, so you can land anywhere, and you feel at home. You’re given the sense that you’re everywhere, but you’re nowhere; that you are constantly with your community, yet you have no community. There’s kind of a terrific irony to that.”It is a short metaphorical walk, Mr. Reitman suggests, from the temporary bonhomie of airports to the social networks proliferating through our wired society.“Technology works the same way. Things like Facebook have made you feel as though you’re connected to everybody,” he said, indicating his iPhone. “You’ve got a thousand friends on Facebook, but you don’t actually talk to anybody. You’re not close to anybody.”This lack of attachment, both physical and emotional, frees Mr. Clooney’s character and imprisons him at the same time. His chosen path of piling up the miles while missing connections with his fellow humans comes in for scrutiny when his boss in Omaha (played by Jason Bateman, who also starred in “Juno”) becomes impressed by a fresh-out-of-college innovator inhabited by Anna Kendrick. She officiously argues that it’s much more cost effective to ship the outplacement brochures to each location and ruin people’s life remotely. She is sent on the road with Mr. Clooney’s character to be schooled in the face-to-face process even as she argues for its obsolescence. With his black belt in both travel and dismissals — her newbie status at both is the source of high jinks — he teaches her never to check luggage and to tell the freshly disenfranchised, “Everything you need to know is in the brochure.”That last piece of advice is, of course, a lie, something that becomes clear in the reaction shots of the people whose lives are being fundamentally altered. By the time the script was finished and shooting was being set, Mr. Reitman realized that job loss, merely a motif in the script, was something he had to come at more directly. He decided to hold an open casting call for the recently fired in St. Louis and Detroit. Kevin Pilla, a father of four from St. Louis, was cast after he received an untenable relocation offer from his employer, an electronics distribution company.“It gave me a chance to relive the moment and say all of the things that I wanted to say at the time,” Mr. Pilla said. He did not move and now has a job, but it took 19 brutal months, a kind of rolling agony that is etched into the performances of the nonactors who are part of the film.“The second they heard the language of firing, you could just see it,” Mr. Reitman said. “Their eyes would turn, their posture would change, their face would go sallow. One girl broke into hives. It just happened, and they would be in the moment.”“Some people were angry; some people were really sad; some people just had questions, were looking for answers,” he continued. “The scariest thing, the saddest thing, it wasn’t that they didn’t have money. No one complained about that. The harder thing was, people said unanimously, across the board: ‘I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t know where I’m supposed to go from here. When I leave this interview, I get in my car, I don’t know where I need to be.’ That for me is a devastating idea, and the closest thing to what George’s character was going through.”Mr. Reitman originally did not plan to turn Mr. Kirn’s novel into a movie; he had urged his father to buy the rights. But after several stalled attempts to develop it, Ivan Reitman turned to his son.“Jason is always watching all the time and has a gift for dialogue as a writer and a director that is pretty rare,” the elder Mr. Reitman said. “And he has a moral compass about how people are treated that worked very well in this film.”His son took Mr. Kirn’s idea of a man who lived in an airline seat — “I’m from here,” he says cheerfully to a query from a fellow passenger — and wrote several new story lines, including a romance of equals with Ms. Farmiga’s character. In a hotel lobby bar, naturally, they meet cute and begin comparing club cards and membership privileges until they casually hook up, which may be the ultimate amenity of travel. But Mr. Clooney’s character finds himself pining for something more from his fellow road warrior and takes her to the wedding of a family member. It looks as if a movie-magic hug is nigh, but that is not how Mr. Reitman works.“Jason is not somebody who is going to give you the same old tidy ending,” Ms. Farmiga said. “And as an actor, it is much more surprising and invigorating to work on a film like this.”Mr. Reitman’s ability to render imperfect people in watchable ways is not lost on fellow directors.“This movie is funny and sad, a very personal kind of work that is not very common,” said Judd Apatow, the director and producer (“Knocked Up,” “Funny People”) who is a friend of Mr. Reitman. “It’s full of people who are not doing the right thing most of the time, and even though they are a mess, we find them human and relatable.”In an e-mail message from Italy Mr. Clooney said that Mr. Reitman was one of the best directors he’s worked with, on the level of the Coen brothers or Steven Soderbergh. “And with each film he gets better,” he wrote. “He’s nice. He’s smart. He’s accomplished. I hate him.”Despite his upbringing and his professional accolades, Mr. Reitman has little concern for status. (“Jason is the kind of guy who is happy to meet at the old taco stand around the corner from the fancy restaurant,” said Eric Steelberg, a high school friend and the director of photography on this film and “Juno.”)Except when it comes to airline travel. He once flew from Los Angeles to Chicago to pick up a pizza and, not so coincidently, to maintain his status on United Airlines. I mention that the flight I’m about to take will earn me a gold card on Continental.“I’m very proud of you,” he said, offering a fist bump, but he can’t resist a bit of comparison. “I’m at a level on United that is invite-only. It’s called Global Services.”Yes, he’s from here.'"
"'09-11-29,'0','What surprised me about Nicholas Carr’s analysis of the potential breakdown of broadcast TV as we know it was that he never considered how ads may factor into the equation. One of the few growth areas in media spending is in broadband TV ads. So-called preroll ads (15-to-30-second ads usually repurposed from TV) dominate the content on Hulu. Hulu has also been in testing mode on enabling users to choose which ads they watch or to answer a market-research survey rather than view the ads. Some of the most compelling ads have been from packaged-goods companies that appear as single-sponsor units for a program. The ads bookend the content and may appear within it too, and they have a story arcthat continues and pays off with the final ad after the episode.Contrary to Carr’s belief that this will usher in an era of no more “Mad Men,” Internet TV will probably ensure that more programs like “Mad Men” will thrive, because it will enable extended life spans and continuous streams of ad-supported viewers of these shows — not to mention people who sample an episode online and decide they have to buy the DVD. Yes, broadcast will get more drecky and reality driven — but it’s been some time since there were more than a handful of great shows on the networks.'"

"'09-11-30,'1','Trying to prevent a run on its banks and stem financial turmoil that some fear could spread globally, the United Arab Emirates helped calm markets Monday by pledging to lend money to banks operating in Dubai. But the action comes amid concerns about excessive borrowing around the world.The move by the group’s central bank was an attempt to head off the kind of crisis of confidence that froze credit markets last year and brought the global economy to the brink of failure, threatening everyone from hedge fund billionaires to retirees who had their savings in supposedly safe investments.Central bankers and government officials around the world were watching Monday’s stock markets closely for signs that fears are spreading or are being contained. Asian markets closed up about 3 percent while European markets were down by less than 1 percent in late-day trading.Last week, investors fled the stocks of banks with outstanding loans to the tiny emirate and its investment arm, Dubai World. Now, analysts will be watching to see whether investors desert other highly indebted companies.While Dubai is not big enough to set off financial repercussions outside the Middle East, the main fear is that investors could flee risky markets all at once in search of safer havens for their money. As in September 2008, when the failure of Lehman Brothers heightened worries about all financial institutions, they might pull back, regardless of the markets’ strength.Those fears were allayed only after the United States announced a huge bank bailout and began guaranteeing a variety of borrowing that slowly helped credit markets begin functioning again. That many of these measures remain in place could help contain any problems from Dubai now.But while the United Arab Emirates federation is following a similar strategy, albeit on a smaller scale, analysts expressed concern that the promise of added funds to support Dubai banks might not be enough to keep anxiety from jumping to other countries and institutions.Indeed, an analysis from Goldman Sachs on Sunday said that the failure of federation authorities to provide a blanket guarantee for all of Dubai’s debt showed that governments worldwide were less willing to bail out overextended companies and their investors.“This episode represents a timely reminder that emergency public funding support should not be taken for granted,” wrote Francesco Garzarelli, an analyst based in London for Goldman.The extent to which the federation and its wealthiest member-state, Abu Dhabi, which has vast oil reserves, appear to guarantee Dubai’s debts could affect how investors view many other companies previously believed to have the implicit backing of their governments.A top Dubai finance official, Abdulrahman al-Saleh, director general of Dubai’s Finance Department, made it clear on Monday however that Dubai World itself was not guaranteed by the emirate’s government.“There are plenty of people around in world capitals who are tired of bailouts,” said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.As a result, banks that made big loans to some heavily indebted governments and companies might start to incur more losses. The shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered, which lent heavily to Dubai, have fallen sharply in the last week, and Mr. Johnson said that the cost of insuring against defaults by big Irish banks has surged since the Dubai announcement.A fear of contagion from Dubai would further destabilize European banks that were only starting to mend.The Dubai crisis began last week, when the emirate said Dubai World would not be able to make on-time payments for some of its $59 billion in debt. The company invested in lavish real estate projects, including artificial islands in the shape of a palm tree and a globe, and spent heavily to acquire stakes in glittering properties like Barneys in New York and the MGM Mirage in Las Vegas.Dubai was far from alone in taking on too much debt as companies and countries around the world did the same. Investors have already been alarmed by problems in countries in Eastern Europe, in Ireland and in Greece.Dubai’s problems are also a reminder of the lasting effects of the global real estate bubble, which remains a danger in the United States, where several big banks are encumbered by souring commercial real estate loans.There is a concern that governments have responded to the financial crisis by taking on unsustainable levels of debt that they may no longer be able to finance. Even in the United States, public debt is forecast to rise to around 80 percent, from about 40 percent, of gross domestic product, the economist Nouriel Roubini said.“Dubai could be the beginning of a series of sovereign debt issues or crises,” said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the giant bond-trading firm. “What Dubai is going to do is make people think more intensely about the lagging implications of last year’s crisis. It’s going to be a wake-up call to the people who thought that the financial crisis was just a flesh wound.”Many analysts expect federation authorities to release further details as soon as Monday on how they plan to restructure the debt of Dubai and Dubai World to keep markets calm.Analysts will be watching crucial indicators of stability or alarm. The most apparent will be if money is pulled from other investments to the safe havens. Analysts will be monitoring the amount of interest that investors demand to lend money to emerging market countries. It has already risen sharply since the Dubai crisis erupted on Wednesday.'"
"'09-11-30,'1','But those developments also come as, several analysts say, reporting has never been more dangerous, for everyone.“This business of inexperienced people going into conflict zones without proper preparation or training is increasingly worrying,” said Rodney Pinder, the former global editor of Reuters Television who is now the director of the International News Safety Institute, a charity financed largely by news organizations and based in Brussels.“There’s a lot of ignorance behind some of this behavior, because people don’t realize how dangerous it’s become for journalists in the world today,” he said. Mr. Pinder’s organization estimates that about 1,500 people have been killed while working for news organizations in the last decade.Ms. Lindhout and Mr. Brennan remained hospitalized on Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya, where they were taken after their release. Ms. Lindhout was expected to be released on Sunday. Neither they nor their families were speaking to reporters.But interviews with former associates of Ms. Lindhout and accounts by Canadian news organizations portray her as a passionate, tough-minded and curious young woman. Paul Vickers, a restaurant and bar owner in Calgary, said that Ms. Lindhout worked long enough at one of his pubs to pay for a trip and “when she ran out of money, she came back here.”Several news reports indicated that Ms. Lindhout had traveled with Mr. Brennan to Somalia to report for France 24, a news channel owned by the French government.While Ms. Lindhout had filed a few reports to the network from Iraq, Nathalie Lenfant, a spokeswoman for France 24, said the network had turned down her proposal to act as a correspondent from Iraq as well as her subsequent suggestion that she report from Somalia. During her capture, Ms. Lenfant said, France 24 decided to confirm that Ms. Lindhout had been on a freelance assignment, even though that was not the case.“We thought it would be better if she could be seen to be part of the structure of a larger company,” Ms. Lenfant said.Robert Draper was already in Somalia on an assignment for National Geographic when Ms. Lindhout and Mr. Brennan arrived. Mr. Draper said that it was apparent that she had been the driving force behind their trip. She had met Mr. Brennan backpacking in Ethiopia. While Mr. Brennan was in Somalia as a photographer, Mr. Draper said, it was not clear whether he had ever sold any photographs.“She was eager to make a name for herself, and I don’t say that as a negative,” Mr. Draper said. “But a lot of the early and intermediate steps one does to become a journalist, she bypassed. Amanda was very eager to go where the action was.”Mr. Draper said that Ms. Lindhout took several precautions, including hiring a local adviser, or so-called fixer. She also listened to advice from the adviser as well as one retained by National Geographic as they repeatedly rejected successive travel plans as excessively dangerous.But Mr. Draper said it was apparent that Ms. Lindhout’s excursion had lacked the degree of planning he had undertaken along with a photographer for the magazine, Pascal Maitre. Her limited finances also restricted the number of armed guards she was able to hire. Journalists from large news organizations will hire up to 10 gunmen, a private army of sorts, at a total cost of $300 to $1,000 a day.No amount of protection can guarantee a reporter’s safety in Somalia, a place Mr. Pinder describes as too dangerous for even many experienced journalists. But when Ms. Lindhout and Mr. Brennan left Mogadishu to see a squalid camp where thousands of refugees sleep in bubble-shape huts made from twigs and plastic bags, they were traveling into a dangerous border region where control passes between the government and warlords.Mr. Pinder’s group and other organizations have programs for improving the safety of freelancers working in war zones. But he is at something of a loss about how to protect people like Ms. Lindhout and Mr. Brennan.A few years ago, he said, several large broadcasters tried to reach an agreement not to buy video from unassigned, unaffiliated freelancers, so as to discourage excessive risk-taking. But that collapsed when it became apparent that no news organization would actually turn down images from a major news event.Given the increasing danger, Mr. Pinder said he hoped that novice journalists would invest in war zone safety training before leaving home and make their first forays into dangerous areas with experienced reporters rather than on their own.Whatever the risks, Mr. Pinder said it was unlikely that aspiring reporters would end their efforts to learn on the job in war zones.“The main driving force is instant fame or instant recognition of some sort,” he said. “It’s a way of breaking into the business at a very competitive high-end level. And what is a journalist at the end of the day?”'"
"'09-11-30,'1','“In the current economic context, all companies are looking for cost-effective I.T. solutions, and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,” said the European Commission’s competition chief, Neelie Kroes, in a recent statement. “The commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.”Oracle, meanwhile, insists that it will continue to develop MySQL and other Sun technologies. Oracle’s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, contends that MySQL serves a different part of the database market than Oracle’s main products do — an assessment supported by many analysts. One main incentive for Oracle to keep improving MySQL is that the program serves as a bulwark against Microsoft’s SQL Server database, which challenges Oracle’s products on the low end.“The commission’s statement of objections reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics,” Oracle said in a statement.To Ms. Kroes’s point, there is an open-source alternative, and usually a pretty good one, to just about every major commercial software product. In the last decade, these open-source wares have put tremendous pricing pressure on their proprietary rivals. Governments and corporations have welcomed this competition.Whether open-source firms are practical as long-term businesses, however, is a much murkier question.The best-known open-source company is Red Hat, which produces a variant of the Linux operating system for server computers. Like most of its peers, Red Hat offers a free version of its base product and relies on selling support services and extra tools for revenue. In its last fiscal year, which ended in March, the company’s revenue rose 25 percent to $653 million, and it reported net income of $79 million.But Red Hat is a rare case. “There’s only one company making real money out of open source, and that’s Red Hat,” said Simon Crosby, the chief technology officer at Citrix Systems, which acquired the open-source software maker XenSource for $500 million in 2007. “Everyone else is in trouble.”The enduring appeal of open-source software revolves more around its disruptive nature than blockbuster sales.As long as there has been software, there have been some people eager to share and improve it for the common good. The rise of the Internet made such sharing easier than ever, enabling people the world over to work together on projects outside the confines of a formal corporate structure.Open-source software has thrived and played a prominent role in the building of the Internet’s infrastructure. Many companies rely on Linux-based computers and Apache Web server software to display their Web pages. Similarly, the Mozilla Firefox Web browser has emerged as the most formidable competitor to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.The grass-roots nature of open source has led advocates to view the projects as a populist foil to proprietary software, where a company keeps the inner workings of its applications secret.But in the last decade, open-source software has become more of a corporate affair than a people’s revolution.In some cases, dominant technology companies have used open-source projects as pawns. Google, for example, has needled Microsoft by providing financial support to the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, which oversees of the development of Firefox. I.B.M. has been a major backer of Linux, helping to raise it as a competitor to Microsoft’s Windows and other proprietary operating systems.Many of the top open-source developers are anything but volunteers tinkering in their spare time. Companies like I.B.M., Google, Oracle and Intel pay these developers top salaries to work on open-source projects and further the companies’ strategic objectives.In the last three years, there have been five big acquisitions in which a major technology company bought an up-and-coming open-source company for many times its annual revenue. Sun, for example, bought MySQL for about 10 times its revenue, while Citrix bought XenSource for more than 150 times its revenue, according to people familiar with the companies’ sales.Most recently, VMware, the leading maker of virtualization software, brought SpringSource for $420 million, or about 20 times its annual sales.“A lot of these guys were getting close to an I.P.O., but they elected to go the acquisition route instead,” said Michael Olson, the chief executive of Cloudera, an open-source start-up. “A lot of open-source firms are one-product companies, and it’s hard to build a long-term, successful business that way.”The larger technology companies have tended to buy these one-trick ponies for strategic purposes. With its core server business declining, Sun hoped it could piggy-back on MySQL’s momentum with Internet companies. In SpringSource, VMware acquired a company that had cultivated deep interest with software developers and helped VMware diversify beyond its virtualization roots.“VMware took into consideration that which money can’t buy, which is a critical mass of adoption,” said Peter Fenton, a venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital, who has been involved in some fashion with many of the large open-source deals. “SpringSource’s main product was the equivalent of a best-selling novel.”Citrix took perhaps the biggest risk of all, paying a huge premium for XenSource in the hopes of disrupting VMware’s position in the virtualization market.“I don’t think Citrix would ever say it paid too much,” Mr. Crosby said. “Citrix leaped to the forefront of a whole software category. The ability to talk credibly about virtualization is worth a huge amount in its own right.”Meanwhile, the ideal of an independent open-source giant has faded.Mr. Fenton said that many open-source advocates had once hoped Red Hat would scoop up the top open-source start-ups, keeping these crown jewels out of the hands of proprietary software makers. But the company failed to go after other open-source companies initially and later could not afford to pay the high prices offered by larger companies.“You could make the case there was a window of opportunity to do that three to five years ago,” Mr. Fenton said. “That opportunity has gone away. And it’s hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again now.”'"
"'09-11-30,'1','Although the Jets lost two fumbles, and Sanchez missed four plays in the third quarter after injuring his left leg, his mistakes were minimal as he employed a newly implemented code system designed to remind him of the level of care he should take when throwing the ball.Sanchez said the code was too complicated for him to explain. Ryan, however, said it was merely a three-tiered framework, communicated by words and colors to Sanchez before each possession and each passing play by Ryan and the offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.For instance, before Sanchez ran onto the field at the start of a possession, say, at the Jets’ 20 early in the game, Ryan might say, “Red.” That would convey Ryan’s concern that Sanchez not make a costly mistake in that situation. As the possession unfolded and the Jets moved down the field, Sanchez might hear a different color in his headset from Schottenheimer, like yellow, suggesting he could be slightly more daring.Obviously, it all depended on the scoreboard. Had the Jets faced a fourth down trailing by 6 points with less than a minute to play, the code would have changed again. It was a basic formula that Ryan assumed Sanchez knew coming into the season. He learned the hard way that Sanchez needed a structured reminder before every passing down.“Basically it’s a thing between me and Rex and Schotty,” Sanchez said. “I don’t know how else to explain it. There’s color codes, there’s words associated with it. I can’t say the whole thing because other teams might be looking to see what we’re trying to do. But just know that the code works, almost like telepathy between the three of us.”The actual code used was not as important as the need for it. Most N.F.L. quarterbacks with at least 10 games of experience should know when to take a chance and when not to. But not all do. The Panthers veteran Jake Delhomme, a former Super Bowl starter, threw four interceptions Sunday, two each to Darrelle Revis and Kerry Rhodes. Two of the interceptions led to Jets touchdowns.On the opening possession of the game, the Panthers were marching down the field. But on third-and-9 from the Jets’ 39 Delhomme threw a pass behind receiver Steve Smith. The ball hit Smith in the back of the leg and bounced to Revis, who easily ran it back 67 yards for a touchdown. That gave Sanchez a 7-0 lead before he stepped onto the field.“We’ve been working on that play, the deflection-off-the-heel play, for a while,” Ryan said. “It’s great coaching.”Ryan was joking, of course, but maybe there was some good coaching involved with the code system. As a first-year head coach, Ryan probably did not think he would have to design a code to tell his quarterback when to be careful and when to take a chance. Or that he would have to sit in on offensive meetings, as he did last week. But it all seemed to work in the Jets’ favor.In the fourth quarter, Sanchez faced a third-and-3 at his 39. As he dropped back, he had a chance to fling the ball to tight end Dustin Keller, something he had tried over and over earlier this season. But in that situation Sunday, the code indicated that the receiver had to be wide open for Sanchez to throw. So he held on to the ball and took a sack, as well as praise from the quarterbacks coach Matt Cavanaugh.“Coach Cav talked to me right after, and Coach Schotty called me up, too,” Sanchez said. “It was a smart play. Did I feel like I could throw the ball to Dustin? Yeah, probably. But is that what we needed right there? What happens if it gets intercepted?”Sanchez’s teammates, who have stuck by him through his growing pains, seemed to appreciate his self-control.“We don’t mind if the kid makes mistakes,” linebacker Bart Scott said, “as long as he doesn’t make the same mistakes over and over again. That’s how you learn how to play football. You make a mistake and learn from it.”'"
"'09-11-30,'1','“There are more interviews to do,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing inquiry.A former White House press secretary, Dana Perino, predicted a tough time for the White House social office as the holiday parties approached.Ms. Perino, a press secretary in the Bush administration, said on “Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace” that once the Salahis were on the White House grounds, the social office might have played a role in processing them through the receiving line.“What will be a concern for, I think, the social office going forward is they have their busiest season coming up,” Ms. Perino said. “It’s the holiday season. They’ll have a lot of people coming through.”Ed Rollins, a Republican political operative, said Sunday that the Salahis should be prosecuted.“They basically trespassed,” Mr. Rollins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “They had no right to be there. The Secret Service has a tough-enough task without having people dress up and pretend they’re important.”Referring to the Salahis’ reported intention to appear on the reality television show “The Real Housewives of Washington,” Mr. Rollins continued, “These people want a reality TV show, give them one. It’s called ‘Dealing With the Federal Prosecution System of the District of Columbia.’ ”A broader sampling of opinion turned up in posts on Ms. Salahi’s Facebook page, where the couple first posted snapshots of their escapade. There it was hailed as an example of American egalitarianism and excoriated as a low-class stunt.The Secret Service’s Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting interviews in the case, and a spokesman for the agency, Jim Mackin, said Sunday that it would be at least Wednesday before the Secret Service would have anything to say. There will be a written report, Mr. Mackin said, “but it probably will not be made public.”“We do have measures in place to handle every type of event that takes place at the White House,” he said. “What we have to do is make sure the measures and protocols we have in place are adhered to every single time.”An independent auditing agency, the office of the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, of which the Secret Service is a part, could also look into the matter, but a department spokesman, Sean Smith, said on Sunday that the department had not asked the inspector general to do so. The inspector general did not reply to a message left at his home.The inspector general’s office prepared a report after The Washington Post in January quoted V.I.P.’s who complained that there were security breaches at Mr. Obama’s inauguration, but by and large the report exonerated the agency.'"
"'09-11-30,'1','While such concerns “have to be taken seriously,” she said in a statement, “The Federal Council takes the view that a ban on the construction of new minarets is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies.”The government must now draft a supporting law on the ban, a process that could take at least a year and could put Switzerland in breach of international conventions on human rights.Of 150 mosques or prayer rooms in Switzerland, only 4 have minarets, and only 2 more minarets are planned. None conduct the call to prayer. There are about 400,000 Muslims in a population of some 7.5 million people. Close to 90 percent of Muslims in Switzerland are from Kosovo and Turkey, and most do not adhere to the codes of dress and conduct associated with conservative Muslim countries like , said Manon Schick, a spokeswoman for in Switzerland.“Most painful for us is not the minaret ban, but the symbol sent by this vote,” said Farhad Afshar, who runs the Coordination of Islamic Organizations in Switzerland. “Muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community.”The Swiss vote reflected a growing anxiety about Islam, especially its more fundamentalist forms, in many countries of Western Europe. , for example, has been talking about banning the full Islamic veil as a way to stop the influence of the more fundamentalist Salafist forms of Islam, popular among some of the young and also converts.Pre-referendum polls had indicated a comfortable, if slowly shrinking, majority against the proposal, after a controversial campaign that played aggressively on the same fears of Muslim and the spread of Islamic values that resonate in other parts of Europe.Media Tenor International, which monitors television coverage, said that the main Swiss evening news programs tended to report about Islam “primarily in the context of terrorism and international conflict.” Representatives of Islam “were quoted only infrequently,” said the group’s president, Roland Schatz.“That Switzerland, a country with a long tradition of religious tolerance and the provision of refuge to the persecuted, should have accepted such a grotesquely discriminatory proposal is shocking,” said David Diaz-Jogeix, Amnesty International’s deputy program director for Europe and Central Asia.Campaign posters depicting a Swiss flag sprouting black, missile-shaped minarets alongside a woman shrouded in a , a head-to-toe veil that shows only the eyes, starkly illustrated the determination of the right to play on deep-rooted fears that Muslim immigration would lead to an erosion of Swiss values.In a recent televised debate, Ulrich Schlüer, a member of Parliament from the S.V.P., said minarets were a symbol of “the political will to take power” and establish , or religious law.He also claimed that Switzerland already suffered from thousands of forced marriages.That debate prompted the government to mount a public relations campaign overseas to try to avoid a backlash like the one Denmark faced in Islamic countries after a newspaper published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, and to avoid damage to lucrative commercial and banking ties with wealthy Muslims.Muslim leaders have tried to keep out of the spotlight and to avoid internationalizing the issue, shunning interviews with most news outlets from Muslim countries, according to Youssef Ibram, an imam at Geneva’s main mosque and Islamic Cultural Foundation.Still, the campaign was accompanied by sporadic shows of hostility. Last week, vandals threw stones and a pot of paint at Geneva’s main mosque.In an interview before the referendum, Mr. Ibram said that whatever the outcome of the vote, Muslims would lose out from a campaign that had played on fears of Islam and exposed deep-seated opposition to their community among many Swiss.'"
