The sentencing took place two to three months ago in a court in the Chamdo area of the Tibet Autonomous Region, but details emerged only this week. Khenpo Kartse, whose full name is Karma Tsewang, has been detained since last December, and full details on the charges against him are not known, according to International Campaign for Tibet.

The report by Radio Free Asia said he had been accused of harboring a fugitive monk from Chamdo in his own monastery in the Yushu area of Qinghai Province. Khenpo Kartse had been detained in Chamdo before the trial, the reports said, and he might be transferred to a prison east of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.

The Chinese authorities have carried out a broad security crackdown across the Tibetan plateau since a widespread Tibetan uprising in 2008.'"
