With a putter he once borrowed from his mother and never returned, Points rolled in a putt from just outside 12 feet on the final hole to polish off a six-under 66 and avoid a sudden-death playoff with Henrik Stenson and Billy Horschel.

It was quite a turnaround for Points, whose only other PGA Tour win was at Pebble Beach two years ago. He started the year by missing the cut seven times in nine tournaments. He arrived at the tournament at Redstone Golf Club in Humble, Texas, having not broken 70 in his last nine rounds. But he stayed in the hunt after opening with a 64, and he kept his calm when he returned to the golf course after a rain delay of nearly three hours.'"
