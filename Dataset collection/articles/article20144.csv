Alaska Dispatch, a six-year-old website owned and published by Alice Rogoff, the wife of the billionaire David Rubenstein, is buying the 68-year-old Anchorage Daily News from the McClatchy Company for $34 million, the two companies announced Tuesday afternoon.

The price included not only the newspaper, which has the largest circulation in the state, but its building as well. In an interview, Ms. Rogoff said that the building constituted much of the purchase price and that it would be resold after she retained ownership in May.

The deal is just one more in a wave of investments by millionaires into the faltering newspaper business. Among the notable recent takeovers, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post; John Henry, the owner of the Boston Red Sox, bought The Boston Globe; and the real estate developer Doug Manchester bought The San Diego Union-Tribune and renamed it U-T San Diego.

Although married to the private equity investor who founded the Carlyle Group in Washington, Ms. Rogoff has had her own independent publishing career. From 1985 to 1997, she was the chief financial officer of U.S. News and World Report. Earlier in her career she served as an assistant to Donald Graham, when he was the publisher of The Washington Post.

In recent years, Ms. Rogoff has taken a passionate personal interest in Alaska and moved to the state. She established a lecture series to raise awareness of global interests in the North Pole and she is the co-founder of a number of other organizations, including the Alaska Native Arts Foundation.

She bought a majority stake in Alaska Dispatch in 2009 and not only became its publisher, but contributes articles and photos that she takes from a private plane that she pilots.'"

The law, which passed the Legislature with only Democratic votes, raises the wage to $9.50 by 2016 from $6.15 per hour. For large employers, minimum hourly pay will climb to $8 in August, $9 a year later and $9.50 in 2016. Employers with gross sales below $500,000 will also have to pay more, though their rate reaches $7.75 per hour by 2016. There are exceptions for teenage workers and those getting trained into new jobs. The law authorizes automatic raises in the years to come tied to inflation.

"'199','2014-04-29','An American couple in Qatar convicted of child endangerment in the death of their adopted daughter from Africa, and not the original charge of murder, were denied permission on Monday to return home while their appeal is pending, and they faced the new possibility that Qatari prosecutors would seek to charge them with human trafficking.

Defense experts expressed shock at the developments, which came at the first hearing in the appeal by the couple, Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles, who were sentenced to three years in prison last month. They have asserted their innocence in a case that has come to symbolize what critics call the arbitrary and opaque system of Islamic justice in the criminal courts of Qatar, the affluent Persian Gulf emirate that has sought to portray itself as a progressive beacon of Middle East multiculturalism.

On the contrary, the Huangs and their defense lawyers have argued, the prosecution has revealed ingrained prejudices about multiracial families and adoption by having assumed that the parents, who are of Asian descent, had no legitimate reason to have children who are of African descent.

The State Department has expressed concern about the fairness of the case. The Huangs have been supported by the California Innocence Project, a group that helps with the defense of what it considers unjust prosecutions, and by the David House Agency, a Los Angeles group that assists Americans trapped in legal crises overseas.

The couple, who were living in Qatar because Mr. Huang was working on an engineering project, were arrested in January 2013 after their daughter, Gloria, 8, adopted from Ghana, was pronounced dead at a hospital after having not eaten for four days. Prosecutors said then that they suspected that the Huangs were child traffickers who had abused the child by starving her with the intent to sell her organs. The couple said she suffered an eating disorder, and defense witnesses said she had been active and happy the day before she died.'"
