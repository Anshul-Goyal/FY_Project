"'64','2014-12-09','By winning, they lose. This week the Jets face another 2-11 team, the Tennessee Titans, with the winner denting its chances of securing the first pick in the draft.

""That doesn't mean that we're going to approach this game any different,"" said Coach Rex Ryan, whose best receiver Sunday, Percy Harvin, seems unlikely to play because of a sprained ankle. ""Because we're going to try to win the game.""

Comforting thought, that. Every week the Jets try to win -- honest, they do -- and they did again Sunday in Minnesota, where they went 0 for 5 in the red zone, lost a fumble at the goal line and allowed a game-winning 87-yard touchdown on a screen pass. They made it almost exciting by losing in overtime, 30-24.

""You go back and look at it and you're sick to it, because you realize how one play can affect the outcome of a game,"" Ryan said. ""But that's kind of been our story this whole year.""

A problem for the Jets this season has been that not just one play goes awry. It is two. Or four. Or seven. And they do not make enough good plays to compensate.

Even though Smith rebounded to finish 18 of 29 for 254 yards after throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown on the game's first snap, he failed to lead the Jets into the end zone on five tries inside the Vikings' 20-yard line.

""We're young and learning and we're going to find ways to win,"" Smith said.

Whether Smith will be around in 2015 to find ways to win is most likely out of his control. His future depends, in part, on who is coaching the team, and also if there is a new general manager.

Less uncertain is the presence of Richardson, whose continued improvement has been one of the few positive developments of the season. Pro Football Focus ranks Richardson fifth among the 48 defensive ends who play in a 3-4 scheme, third against the run and, unofficially, first in striving to catch speedy receivers.

Even as Jarius Wright raced down the sideline with the winning touchdown, after Ryan's aggressive defensive call left no safety deep to help, Richardson gave chase, pursuing him for 30 yards. Early on, he thought he had an angle, but he just could not close.

Ryan said he appreciated Richardson's effort. Richardson said he never considered giving up on it.

""This is a team-oriented game, but this is a business in the end,"" Richardson said. ""And I've still got something to play for.""'"
"'65','2014-12-09','More than half of the overall package -- about $554 billion -- would go to military spending. The deal would also allocate roughly $948 million to handle the surge of unaccompanied minor children who began pouring across the southern border this summer.

Negotiations grew contentious on Monday and the public release of the legislation was likely to slip until Tuesday. The delay would push a House vote on the deal from Wednesday -- the target date -- to Thursday, with little margin for error to pass the package to avoid a government shutdown.

Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, did not rule out a 24- or 48-hour short-term measure to give Congress some additional time to pass the spending package, but seemed confident the legislation would ultimately make it through.

""I believe that we will not have a shutdown, and I believe that we will not have government on autopilot,"" she said. ""The exact time and hour -- I'm not exactly sure.""

Policy prescriptions, including those to ease standards on school lunch content and the Environmental Protection Agency's jurisdiction over some bodies of water, have been more contentious than the negotiations over money. Cultural conservatives in the House and Senate were also pressing to include a ""conscience clause"" for employers who say funding contraception violates their religious beliefs.

""Nobody here is disagreeing on nutrition in school lunches,"" said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. ""It's just that sometimes people carrying out your wishes are so overzealous they go beyond what you were asking.""

Republicans maintain that efforts by the first lady and congressional Democrats to improve school nutrition by reducing the sodium content and increasing the percentage of whole grains in school lunches have become onerous for beleaguered school cafeterias. The eased school lunch standards are ""about pace and flexibility,"" Mr. Cole said.

Meantime, conservatives on and off Capitol Hill were growing more leery as lawmakers tried to stuff the spending plan with other, only marginally related measures. Lawmakers were considering add-ons to extend federal terrorism risk insurance for private developers and to shore up the ailing federal pension regulator, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

The $1 trillion spending bill would fund almost all the government through September 2015 but keep the Department of Homeland Security open only through February to keep pressure on the president over his executive action to defer deportation of as many as five million illegal immigrants.

Military projects were given the benefit of the doubt in a package that will bear the fingerprints of Republican negotiators more than any other spending legislation has since the party took control of the House. For instance, seven reserve Awacs surveillance planes the administration wanted to cut from the Air Force Reserves will be saved at Tinker Air Force Base in Mr. Cole's district.

Conservative groups like Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, were pressuring Republicans to vote against the measure, saying it did too little to combat Mr. Obama's increasingly bold use of executive authority. That, in turn, strengthened the Democrats' hands, since with Republican defections it will take Democratic votes to secure a majority to pass the bill.

""I remain cautiously optimistic that there will be sufficient votes,"" said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, who added that his preference would have been to pass a broad spending bill to fund all of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security, through the current fiscal year. ""Maybe in the new year we add some policy riders, but at the end of the day we're going to pass the Homeland Security bill, so why not do it now rather than wait.""

Speaker John A. Boehner may need several dozen Democratic votes to push the legislation through the Republican-controlled House, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, has signaled that she will provide the necessary votes only if Democrats and Republicans can find ""common ground"" on the policy provisions.

Mr. Cole said Ms. Pelosi's objections over policy prescriptions were ""a desperate attempt to stay relevant.""

Mr. Boehner, meanwhile, has been busy trying to corral his own restive conference into supporting the broad spending bill. But some conservative lawmakers are still refusing to vote for the package, arguing that it does not go far enough to fight Mr. Obama's action on immigration.

Democrats and the administration, however, worry that the short-term Homeland Security funding could have immediate negative ramifications. Department officials pointed to border enforcement and national security programs that Republicans have supported in the past, which they said would suffer with short-term funding.'"
