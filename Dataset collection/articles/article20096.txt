19 2009-06-01 An estimated 306,000 copies of the print edition of The Herald were distributed in a promotion that took place in eight major markets, including Atlanta, Chicago and Miami.

In two of those markets — New York and San Francisco — the free (fake) paper was accompanied by free (real) cups of coffee.

The jest behind the paper is that it was reported and edited by dogs for dogs. From the weather forecast (“It’s going to rain men and women”) to the classified ads (“For sale: Used stick. Hardly chewed. Has most of its original bark”), The Herald is completely canine-centric.

After all, if they say “Dog bites man is not news; man bites dog is news,” how newsworthy must it be when “dog writes newspaper”?

The mock newspaper is a time-honored tactic in advertising, but it would not be surprising if the decline of the newspaper industry led to fewer marketers undertaking such efforts.

That has not happened, at least not yet. In addition to The Herald from Mars Petcare U.S., the HBO division of Time Warner plans to publish a parody of the giveaway tabloid AM New York. The spoof, reported by AdAge.com, will promote the coming second season of the series “True Blood.”

Or, as a man asks as his dog brings him the paper in a cartoon in the June 8-15 issue of The New Yorker magazine, “Yes, we still love print, don’t we?”

The campaign for Cesar Sunrise includes, in addition to The Herald, television commercials, magazine ads, coupon inserts and content on the cesar.com Web site. The campaign carries the theme “Wake up to something special,” along with the slogan for the Cesar brand, “Love them back.”

It may seem risky to bring out a breakfast food for dogs during a severe economic downturn, but that has not proven to be the case, says Anne Herrington, marketing director for Mars Petcare U.S. in Franklin, Tenn.

“We’ve had some really strong results” since Cesar Sunrise was brought out in late March, Ms. Herrington says. “It is such a perfect extension of the core brand.”

Over all, “our core consumers have stayed quite strong,” she adds, reflecting that “Cesar’s loyalty rate is the highest in the category.”

Assisting Cesar’s sales performance is the fact the brand is perceived as an “affordable luxury,” Ms. Herrington says, because “in most parts of the country it’s under a dollar per unit.”

Cesar Sunrise is “another opportunity to increase purchase frequency,” she adds.

The idea for the new product grew from Cesar’s brand DNA as “gourmet food for the small dog you adore,” Ms. Herrington says, and the new line “leverages the strength of the connection consumers have with their small dogs.”

“Most of our line is meat-based, acknowledging the humanization trend,” she adds, referring to the increasing predilection for dog owners to feed their pets the types of food they themselves eat. The Cesar varieties include pork tenderloin, grilled chicken, turkey and filet mignon.

But “you don’t want to eat filet mignon for breakfast,” Ms. Herrington says, hence the concept to develop varieties that would be “customized for the breakfast occasion.”

The three flavors of Cesar Sunrise are smoked bacon and egg; chicken and cheddar cheese soufflé; and grilled steak and eggs.

Is it any reason that the expression “It’s a dog’s life” is changing from one that means how hard things are to one that means to have it easy?

The belief that dogs, like their owners, ought to have special food in the morning came from a study conducted by BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, about behaviors that become daily rituals — for humans, not pets.

“We learned a lot about breakfast rituals” from the study, says Jim Lesser, executive creative director at BBDO West, based in San Francisco, primarily that “people are on autopilot and you have to shake them awake, no pun intended, to get them to change behavior.”

The make-believe newspaper, along with the coffee giveaways, were “to really plug the brand into the morning ritual in exciting ways,” he adds, so that Cesar Sunrise would seem as much a part of breakfast as French toast, oatmeal or pancakes (for humans, that is).

As part of that strategy, some ads are being scheduled to appear during “morning media,” Mr. Lesser says. So, for instance, the television commercials run only in early day parts.

And The Herald was, of course, a morning newspaper, distributed to commuters and passers-by early in the work day. The parody paper was very low-key in its peddling, limiting references to Cesar Sunrise to ads on inside pages.

The ads, which are doubling as the print campaign that is running in magazines, show small dogs mimicking the morning behavior of humans. In one ad, a dog is yawning with its eyes practically closed.

In another ad, the fur atop a dog’s head is askew, as if it was suffering from a bad case of bed head.

Mixed in with the real ads in The Herald are hilarious fake ads for products like a fragrance named Heat (“Bring out the animal in him”); a canine lawyer, Merv the “legal beagle”; and a language course called Rosetta Bone, for dogs that want to “bark in a different language.”

Then there are the classified ads, which take up only a small part of a page of The Herald — just like in an actual newspaper. (Are dogs using Craigslist, too?)

In addition to the for-sale ad for the used stick, there are classifieds seeking a lost human (“Responds to ‘Knuckles’ ”), romance (“Are you my Tramp?”) and canines that want jobs like junkyard dog (“Must provide own chain”) and start-up mascot (“Hip Internet software company seeks dog to lie around on poured concrete floors to give office casual air”).

The dog paper has many other features that are staples of papers for humans. There is a daily horoscope, a fashion and life style page, sports news, a crossword puzzle and even a Op-Ed page with articles carrying headlines like “Sorry Big Dogs, Small Is Way Better” and “Begging: Is It Always Beneath You?”

There are also articles that mock the conventions of real journalism. Some report court news (“Catnip Pyramid Scheme Sends Pooch to Pound”). Some report medical news (“Chasing Tail Okay, Vets Say”). And some are breathy bearers of scandal (“Pics of Dog Show Winner Drinking From Toilet Posted on Web”).

“It was a tremendous amount of work to write all that content,” Mr. Lesser says, “but it was really worth it.”

The laughs continue from the print edition of The Herald to the Internet. Careful readers of the article about the dog-show winner caught “bleary-eyed with a rabid gleam as she dives snout-first into the toilet of an unidentified human” will notice a reference to a Web site called chokingbone.com.

On that site, part of the Cesar Sunrise campaign, are photographs of additional imaginary canine scandals bearing sensational write-ups worthy of tmz.com or perezhilton.com.

Among them are photos of “once glamorous Chou-Chou LaRue caught ungroomed” and “a disoriented and disorderly Rex Ruff found rummaging through neighbor’s garbage.”

The funniest item may be a report about “notorious French bulldog-about-town Rowdy,” spotted outside a Kabbalah Center wearing a yarmulke.

“When questioned about his new faith, Rowdy barked, ‘Until Kabbalah, my life was just about the next bone — but now I want something more,’ ” the item reads. “Is our little mutt becoming a mensch?”

Hmmmm. Perhaps the next flavor of Cesar Sunrise will be smoked salmon with a schmear.

20 2009-06-01 Credit Suisse said it has brought in Barclays' former chief financial officer for the Americas, James Walker, to be its new head of investment banking operations in the region....
21 2009-06-01 The original restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler earlier this year did not call for the sweeping changes these companies needed to survive -- and I couldn't in good conscience proceed on that basis. So we gave them a chance to develop a stronger plan that would put them on a path toward long-term viability. The 60 days GM had to submit its revised plans have now elapsed, and I want to say a few words about where we are and what steps will be taken going forward. But before I do, I want to give you an update on where things stand with Chrysler.

When my administration took office and began going over Chrysler's books, the future of this great American car company was uncertain. In fact, it was not clear whether it had any future at all. But after consulting with my Auto Task Force, industry experts, and financial advisors, and after asking many tough questions, I became convinced that if Chrysler were willing to undergo a restructuring, and if it were able to form a partnership with a viable global car company, then Chrysler could get a new lease on life.

Well, that more promising scenario has now come to pass. Today, after taking a number of painful steps, and moving through a quick, efficient, and fair bankruptcy process, a new, stronger Chrysler is poised to complete its alliance with Fiat. Just 31 days after Chrysler's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, a court has approved the Chrysler-Fiat alliance, paving the way for a new Chrysler to emerge from bankruptcy in the next few days.

What happens next is in the hands of their executives, managers, and workers -- as it is for any private company. But what the completion of this alliance means is that tens of thousands of jobs that would have been lost if Chrysler had liquidated will now be saved, and that consumers have no reason at all to worry about a restructuring -- even one as painful as what Chrysler underwent.

And keep in mind -- many experts said that a quick, surgical bankruptcy was impossible. They were wrong. Others predicted that Chrysler's decision to enter bankruptcy would lead to an immediate collapse in consumer confidence that would send car sales over a cliff. They were wrong, as well. In fact, Chrysler sold more cars in May than it did in April, in part because consumers were comforted by our extraordinary commitment to stand behind a quick bankruptcy process. All in all, it's a dramatic -- an outcome dramatically better than what appeared likely when this process began.

Now the situation we found at General Motors was very different from what we found at Chrysler -- largely because GM is a different kind of company. It is much larger and much more complex, with operations all over the globe. In this context, GM's management team -- including its new CEO, Fritz Henderson, its interim chairman, Kent Kresa, and all of their colleagues -- have worked -- has worked tirelessly to produce a plan that meets the strict standards I laid out at the beginning: to streamline GM's brands, clean up GM's balance sheet, and make it possible for GM to compete and succeed.

Working with my Auto Task Force, GM and its stakeholders have produced a viable, achievable plan that will give this iconic American company a chance to rise again. It's a plan tailored to the realities of today's auto market; a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars. As this plan takes effect, GM will start building a larger share of its cars here at home, including fuel-efficient cars. In fact, if all goes according to plan, the share of GM cars sold in the United States that are made here will actually grow for the first time in three decades.

Now, any time a business as large as General Motors goes through a restructuring, it is extremely difficult to find common ground among all of the company's stakeholders. But while the deal that has been worked out is tough, it is also fair.

It will require the United Auto Workers to make further cuts in compensation and retiree health care benefits -- painful sacrifices on top of all that they have already done.

It will require GM shareholders to give up the remaining value of their shares -- just as they would have had to do in any private restructuring of this kind.

And it will also provide unsecured bondholders with an equitable outcome -- an outcome that will let them recover more than the current value of their claims, and substantially more than they would have recovered if the government had not intervened and GM had liquidated. That's why a majority of GM's bondholders already support this deal.

Throughout this process, I wanted to ensure that none of GM's stakeholders receives special treatment because of our government's involvement. That's why I instructed my Auto Task Force to treat all of GM's stakeholders fairly and to ensure that this restructuring was carried out in a way that was consistent with past precedent -- and it was.

What we have, then, is a credible plan that is full of promise. But GM can't put this plan into effect on its own. Executing this plan will require a substantial amount of money that only a government can provide. Considering GM's extensive operations within their borders, the governments of Canada and Ontario have agreed to do their part with an investment in GM's future, and I want to thank them for doing so. I also want to thank the government of Germany for working diligently to reach a Memorandum of Understanding on the sale of a major stake in GM's European Division and for providing interim funding that will make it possible for that transaction to be finalized.

But of course GM is an American company with tens of thousands of employees in this country, and responsibility for its future ultimately rests with us. That's why our government will be making a significant additional investment of about $30 billion in GM -- an investment that will entitle American taxpayers to ownership of about 60 percent of the new GM.

Now, let me talk about this. I recognize that this may give some Americans pause. So let me explain as clearly as possible why we are making this investment. We inherited a financial crisis unlike any that we've seen in our time. This crisis crippled private capital markets and forced us to take steps in our financial system -- and with our auto companies -- that we would not have otherwise even considered. These steps have put our government in the unwelcome position of owning large stakes in private companies for the simple and compelling reason that their survival and the success of our overall economy depend on it.

Understand we're making these investments not because I want to spend the American people's tax dollars, but because I want to protect them. Instead of taking so much stock in GM, we could have simply offered the company more loans. But for years, GM has been buried under an unsustainable mountain of debt. And piling an irresponsibly large debt on top of the new GM would mean simply repeating the mistakes of the past. So we are acting as reluctant shareholders -- because that is the only way to help GM succeed.

What we are not doing -- what I have no interest in doing -- is running GM. GM will be run by a private board of directors and management team with a track record in American manufacturing that reflects a commitment to innovation and quality. They -- and not the government -- will call the shots and make the decisions about how to turn this company around. The federal government will refrain from exercising its rights as a shareholder in all but the most fundamental corporate decisions. When a difficult decision has to be made on matters like where to open a new plant or what type of new car to make, the new GM, not the United States government, will make that decision.

In short, our goal is to get GM back on its feet, take a hands-off approach, and get out quickly.

Exiting a restructuring of this scale, however, requires not only new investment. It also requires giving GM a chance to start anew by clearing away the massive past debts that are weighing the company down. And that's why earlier today, GM did what Chrysler has successfully done and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with the support of its key stakeholders and the United States government.

In all likelihood, this process will take more time for GM than it did for Chrysler because GM is a bigger, more complex company. But Chrysler's extraordinary success reaffirms my confidence that GM will emerge from its bankruptcy process quickly, and as a stronger and more competitive company. And I want to remind everyone that if you are considering buying a GM car during this period of restructuring, your warrantees will be safe and government-backed.

So I'm confident that the steps I'm announcing today will mark the end of an old GM, and the beginning of a new GM; a new GM that can produce the high-quality, safe, and fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow; that can lead America towards an energy independent future; and that is once more a symbol of America's success.

But I want to be honest with you. Building a leaner GM will come at a cost. It will take a painful toll on many Americans who have relied on General Motors throughout the generations. So I want to say a word directly to all the men and women watching today, wondering what all of this will mean as far as their own lives are concerned.

I know you've already seen more than your fair share of hard times. We saw 400,000 jobs lost in the auto industry in the year before this restructuring even began. I will not pretend the hard times are over. Difficult days lie ahead. More jobs will be lost. More plants will close. More dealerships will shut their doors, and so will many parts suppliers.

But I want you to know that what you're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation -- a sacrifice you may not have chose to make, but a sacrifice you were nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an America that still makes things; that still builds cars; that still strives for a better future.

As our autoworkers and auto communities pass through these difficult times, we, as a nation, must do our part. That's why, in March, I appointed Ed Montgomery Director of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers. That's why two weeks ago Ed announced a green jobs training program for autoworkers in hard-hit communities. And that's why last week Ed and Karen Mills, my Small Business Administration chief, traveled to Indiana to announce a new plan to provide loans to auto, RV, and boat dealers to help finance floor plans. That's why we are accelerating the purchase of a federal fleet of cars to jumpstart demand and give the industry a boost at a time when it needs one. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass fleet modernization legislation that can provide a credit to consumers who turn in old cars and purchase cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars. These are important steps on the long road to overcoming a problem that didn't happen overnight and will not be solved overnight.

I recognize that today's news carries a particular importance because it's not just any company we're talking about -- it's GM. It's a company that's not only been a source of income, but a source of pride for generations of autoworkers and generations of Americans. But while the GM of the future will be different from the GM of the past, I am absolutely confident that if well managed, a new GM will emerge that can provide a new generation of Americans with a chance to live out their dreams, that can out-compete automakers around the world, and that can once again be an integral part of America's economic future. And when that happens, we can truly say that what is good for General Motors and all who work there is good for the United States of America.

Thank you, everybody.

30 2009-06-01 Marino, a 29-year-old from Oklahoma, pulled his drive into a spotty lie above the left fairway bunker 139 yards from the green. He tried to punch a shot that nicked a tree branch and stopped 90 feet from the hole. His pitch stopped short, and he missed his par putt.

“To be sitting here, I feel very fortunate,” Stricker said. “It’s funny how things work out. I’ve been on the other end a couple, three times this year where you think you are going to win and all of a sudden things don’t go your way and you end up losing. So this one feels very good.”

Clark was almost disconsolate after the loss. Last year, he watched in disbelief from the edge of the green as Phil Mickelson pulled off a stunning shot from the trees at the final hole and made a birdie to beat him. He said at the time “that’s what great players do.”

This year, Clark was undone by doing what great players don’t. He began the day with a two-stroke lead and still held that margin with five holes to play. He was seemingly about to cruise to his first win in the United States.

But two huge mistakes off the tee and two missed putts cost him the title. He bogeyed the 14th hole after slicing his tee shot into heavy rough, and he hit his tee shot into the trees at the 18th. Even then, he could have won in regulation by making a 12-footer for par at 18. But he left that putt short, then missed a 7-footer on the first sudden-death hole. When his ball bounced off the flagstick on the next playoff hole, it was the final indignity.

“I saw how close Steve hit it, and I knew I had to do something like that as well,” Clark said. “Bad break or not, the tournament should have ended on the first playoff hole. I didn’t make a confident stroke. I pulled it.”

And Stricker was there to pull the tournament out with the final 3-footer, the one that made up for the 3-footer he missed for par at the 16th.

“I’ve been maintaining a positive attitude,” he said. “Every time I get into contention, I take it as a positive. I really had a couple of good chances to win earlier this year, and I didn’t. At first they stung, not winning, but when I looked back over the week, I realize I did a lot of good things to get myself in that position.

“You know, I guess that’s what I kept telling myself is to keep putting myself back in this position and maybe it will work out.”

CHAMPIONS TOUR PLAYOFF Mark McNulty won the Principal Charity Classic for his seventh Champions Tour victory, beating Fred Funk with a left-to-right birdie putt to end a thrilling playoff in West Des Moines, Iowa.

The 55-year-old McNulty closed with a 5-under 66 to match Funk (66) and the second-round leader, Nick Price (68), at 10-under 203. McNulty and Funk birdied the second extra hole to eliminate Price.

McNulty saved par on the third playoff hole — the par-4 17th — after hitting to the fringe, and Funk’s birdie putt lipped out.

Funk failed to convert a tough birdie try on the par-4 18th, and McNulty’s putt gave him his first win since 2007. (AP)
31 2009-06-01 NBC News coverage of a speech by President Obama in which he discusses the bankruptcy of General Motors.
32 2009-06-01 Ford Motor stands alone among Detroit’s Big Three in dodging a shareholder-crushing government bailout. If automobile sales continue to slide, that may be a short-lived accolade. If not, it is a testament to the carmaker’s hard work, smart financial planning and competent management.

So what does it get for its virtue? So far, not much. President Obama gave Ford’s products a plug and its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, a slap on the back when announcing new emissions standards last month. But the competitive advantage the government’s life-support package would give General Motors, as well as the billions it has injected into Chrysler, must worry Ford.

After Ford’s two domestic rivals emerge from swift trips through the Chapter 11 car wash, they will have cleaned up their legacy cost problems and scaled back their dealer networks in ways Ford, outside of bankruptcy, cannot. As G.M.’s majority shareholder, the government has an incentive — perhaps even a fiduciary obligation — to favor G.M.

To dispel that notion, the government would have to level the playing field. But there’s not much it can do. The White House could expedite the “cash for clunkers” bill now slowly wending its way through Congress and speed up the arrival of cheap Energy Department loans to help develop fuel-efficient vehicles.

And it should continue to bolster the financing markets that Ford Motor Credit depends on to make loans to buyers. These measures would help all carmakers. But if Ford is smart, it can use its status as the only financially virtuous domestic carmaker to good advantage in its advertising as a way to scoop up greater market share.
33 2009-06-01 The Senate owes the American people more than a pro forma confirmation of Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, President Obama’s choice to be the next United States military commander in Afghanistan.

General McChrystal, who goes before the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, built an impressive reputation as commander of the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations teams in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2003 to 2008. Highly trained and motivated task forces under his command captured Saddam Hussein and called in the air strikes that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Successes like these could help turn the tide in Afghanistan.

But there are other, more disturbing aspects of that record that the Senate also must consider. Special Operations task forces operated in secret, outside the normal military chain of command and with minimal legal accountability, especially during the years Donald Rumsfeld ran the Pentagon. General McChrystal’s command substantially overlaps this troubled period.

In 2004, for example, a Special Operations unit converted one of Saddam Hussein’s former torture centers near Baghdad into its own secret interrogation cell, where detainees were subjected to a range of physical and psychological abuses.

This was not an isolated incident. In 2006, The Times reported on field outposts set up by Special Operations units in Baghdad, Falluja, Balad, Ramadi and Kirkuk where detainees were stripped naked and subjected to simulated drowning.

At least 34 Special Operations soldiers were eventually disciplined by the Pentagon for these abusive interrogations. Many more cases had to be dropped because the specific interrogator could not be conclusively identified or because crucial computer records were lost.

While there is no suggestion that General McChrystal was personally involved in any misconduct, he has a clear responsibility to illuminate what went wrong, what if anything was done to stop these horrors, and what he intends to do to ensure that they are not repeated under his command in Afghanistan.
34 2009-06-01 It also places the government in uncharted territory as a business owner, as it takes a 60 percent ownership stake in the company during its restructuring.

Reflecting the government’s extraordinary intervention in industry, aides say, Mr. Obama plans to tell the nation on Monday that he believes G.M. can be brought back from the brink of insolvency, even if the company looks almost nothing like the titan of old.

Meanwhile, a federal judge late Sunday night cleared a path for to get out of bankruptcy by approving a sale of most of that carmaker’s assets to a new entity to be run by of .

Administration officials briefed reporters on the G.M. plans Sunday night, as President Obama began to inform members of Congress. But the White House insisted that the aides who talked to reporters could not be named.

In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Obama will spell out a strategy in which a shrunken G.M. can make money even if new car sales remain at a sluggish 10 million a year in the and even if G.M., once the giant of the industry, drops below its current 20 percent market share in this country.

But to get there, American taxpayers will invest an additional $30 billion in the company, atop $20 billion already spent just to keep it solvent as the company bled cash as quickly as Washington could inject it. Whether that will ever be recovered is still an open question.

The company will also have to shed 21,000 union workers and close 12 to 20 factories, steps that most analysts thought could never be pushed through by a Democratic president allied with organized labor.

Forty percent of the company’s 6,000 dealers will close, the workers’ union will be forced to finance half of its $20 billion health care fund with stock of uncertain value in the restructured G.M., and bondholders, including many retirees, will be forced to take stock worth 10 cents for every dollar they lent the company.

The company’s last steps toward bankruptcy took place over the weekend as a majority of G.M. bondholders agreed not to challenge the filing in court and to exchange their debt for stock.

, who as head of the National Economic Council serves as one of the co-heads of the auto task force, argued in an interview on Sunday that the bailout of the auto industry was fundamentally different from the Mexican bailout in 1994, the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, and the continuing banking crisis.

General Motors and Chrysler, he said, were “clear cases of insolvency,” in which mere would not accomplish the goal of getting the automakers past a temporary crisis. “There was no argument that they were solvent, no argument they could meet their obligations.”

He said that left the Obama administration to decide whether to allow “a laissez-faire, uncontrolled bankruptcy, which would have had an enormous cost,” or a “controlled process,” in which the goal was to make sure that the auto companies not only restructured, but were not overburdened with debt. So, in return for what amounted to debtor-in-possession financing, Mr. Obama chose to accept equity in the new company — while insisting that he had no intention of exercising day-to-day control over the company.

“It’s a fine line,” Mr. Summers said, “but we think it is manageable.”

To assist in the restructuring, the automaker is expected to hire the consulting firm Alix Partners, which has worked on several major bankruptcies, including those for and Kmart. One of the firm’s partners, Al Koch, is expected to manage the liquidation of corporate assets that G.M. will shed during its Chapter 11 restructuring, people with knowledge of the strategy said.

Mr. Obama is taking several risks under the plan. None may be bigger than the decision that the United States government will take its 60 percent share of the stock in a new G.M., leaving taxpayers vulnerable if the overhaul is not successful. ( , for its part, is taking a 12 percent stake.)

“We don’t think that after this next $30 billion, they will need more money,” one administration official said. “But the fact is there are things you don’t know — like when the car market will come back, and how much and and will benefit from the chaos.”

On Monday, Mr. Obama is expected to argue that any alternative to his plan would be worse, and that a liquidation of G.M. — the only other real option — would send the unemployment rate soaring over 10 percent and would radiate damage throughout the economy.

But aware of the hardships the plan will impose on regions across the country that depend on auto production, the White House is dispatching a dozen Cabinet members and other officials across four states this week to reassure residents.

Aides say Mr. Obama will portray himself on Monday as a reluctant shareholder, eager to sell the company back to private investors, perhaps within 6 to 18 months.

Officials say the president will insist that once the government sets up new management and a board of directors, it will remove itself from G.M.’s day-to-day operations. But even his aides anticipate intense pressure as the company’s managers are called to testify in Congress and face questions like why they decided to build new cars in and , rather than in or the South.

“Congress and many Americans are going to say, if we own it, why can’t we make these decisions?” one of Mr. Obama’s top economic aides said, “and it’s going to be a challenge to answer that.”

To ease the way, the White House on Sunday briefed reporters on a new set of principles for how the government should behave as a majority shareholder. It argued that the government’s role should be limited primarily to the beginning of the process, but that it should then recede, becoming a passive investor, one seeking to sell its stake quickly.

At the same time, Mr. Obama has laid out goals for all the Detroit automakers that will presumably affect their major strategic decisions. He has urged them, for example, to build smaller cars with significantly better .

Six months ago, even the suggestion of such deep intervention into G.M.’s operations would have raised huge objections. But by the time the denouement came, the company seemed almost relieved. Robert Lutz, G.M.’s vice chairman, said that “for the first time in our history, the American auto industry has the ear of the administration. Their number one goal is to make us successful.”

Nonetheless, Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the , said the decision would “mean a new chapter in the history books on American capitalism.” He added, “How we think about American free enterprise is really hanging in the balance.”

For Mr. Obama, whose ascent to the White House depended on carrying states across the industrial Midwest, the political risk is significant.

The G.M. bankruptcy will ripple across several states where hundreds of parts suppliers and car dealerships face imminent closings.

Indeed, the four states where Cabinet secretaries are focusing their efforts this week — , Michigan, , — all were carried by Mr. Obama last November. It was the first time Indiana has supported a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.

These Main Street political challenges will almost certainly be an issue for Democrats on the ballot in next year’s midterm election campaign and in the president’s own re-election effort in 2012. If those jobs shift to nonunion plants in the South, where German and Japanese carmakers have built their facilities, or overseas, Mr. Obama could face criticism inside his own party.

“It is unacceptable to ask U.S. workers to subsidize the exportation of their own jobs,” said Representative , Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes . “The taxpayers’ investment should be used to protect American plants so that American workers can build the next generation of automobiles.”

In his presidential campaign speeches last year, often delivered in the shadow of closed manufacturing plants, Mr. Obama bluntly conceded that most of the jobs would not come back. Instead, his administration is pointing to investments that the economic recovery act will make in communities.

Rob McNabney, chairman of the County in Anderson, Ind., a onetime booming automotive center, said the problems for Mr. Obama were severe. “He’s going to be judged by what he does,” Mr. McNabney said.
35 2009-06-01 LONDON (AP) — Facing a national uproar over lawmakers claiming lavish expenses, Britain’s prime minister, Gordon Brown, promised Sunday to pursue constitutional reforms — including a proposal to remove legislators’ power to decide their own pay.

Mr. Brown said he was shocked by the recent revelations that scores of legislators from all three main political parties had filed claims for a range of expenses, including tax advice and swimming pools. He said the government was considering reforms that would mean lawmakers no longer set the rules about their salaries and expenses.

“There will be no more of the gentleman’s club,” Mr. Brown said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “Self-regulation, closed society — that was a 19th-century idea.”

He said he wanted to overhaul the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber, and set up external supervision of Parliament, adding that he wanted an independent panel to scrutinize all lawmakers’ expense claims for the past four years.

Mr. Brown said he wanted a code of conduct for lawmakers to be written into a Constitutional Renewal Bill that is due to go through Parliament later this year. The bill was intended to strengthen Parliament and reduce the role of the attorney general, but the prime minister said he wanted to use it to set up codes for lawmakers.

David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said he wanted Mr. Brown to call an election instead of looking at long-term measures. He also said he wanted to institute a system under which constituents could recall, or fire, lawmakers who are found to have broken the law.
36 2009-06-01 “About 45 percent of the people we see at those screenings have something on them that’s going to have to be treated, and that’s a much higher incidence rate than the general populace,” said Dr. Marta Rendon, a dermatologist who has participated in about a dozen of the golf tournament screenings. “We see skin cancers and a lot of precancerous spots. The screenings have saved a lot of lives.”

Dr. Wendy Roberts, the president of the society, has her practice in Rancho Mirage, Calif., a Valley community known for its many golf courses. She said specific problem areas for golfers included the back of the hand not usually inside a golf glove and the lips, which should be protected by balm with sun block.

“Men also completely forget about their ears, and they miss the patch of skin on the side of their neck just below the ear,” Roberts said. “I remove a lot of cancers from that spot.”

She added: “I have golfers tell me that they’re being careful because they wear a hat or a visor, but when I ask if they put sunscreen on their legs, they say they didn’t think of that because they’re in the golf cart a lot. But the leg is the No. 1 site for in a woman and No. 2 in men.”

The L.P.G.A. has a sun-safety initiative, and many of its players preach the sun-protection gospel. The Women’s Dermatologic Society has been a partner with the help of a grant from L’Oréal USA and has created a Web site with golf sun safety tips, playsafeinthesun.org.

One tip that struck me was to reapply sunscreen every nine holes. If you think about it, if you were exercising on a beach for five straight hours, would you apply sunscreen just once?

Being safe from lightning on the course asks golfers to do something they usually hate to do: stop playing, at least temporarily. And that may be why many golfers are struck. They might see a storm on the horizon, but it’s not raining yet and they haven’t seen lightning. Sure, there was the distant rumble of thunder, but gee, they think, I’m playing so well today. Or, it took me two months to get this tee time.

“Every thunderstorm has its first flash of lightning, and that one is as deadly as all the others,” said John Jensenius, a lightning safety expert.

Lightning often strikes 10 miles from any rainfall and can strike ahead of storms or seemingly after they have passed. Jensenius said golfers should examine the sky and plan.

“On a golf course, you usually have a good view of a coming storm, and if you hear any thunder, you should head inside a building or a hard-topped car as soon as you can get there,” Jensenius said. “I study the case histories of all lightning fatalities. Often, if people had gotten inside 5 or 10 minutes earlier, they would be alive. All the cases are very sad; these are good people who make a mistake.”

Jensenius said golf clubs and other metal objects do not attract lightning and that getting in the cart would not protect you. The rubber tires do not help, he said. Lightning victims, for example, are struck and injured riding lawn mowers. Cars are safe, he said, because they have metal roofs and sides.

“There isn’t anywhere on a golf course that’s safe, and that goes for rain shelters or huts that aren’t sturdy structures built to withstand a lightning strike,” Jensenius said.

The National Weather Service offers safety guidelines and suggestions online at lightningsafety.noaa.gov. A majority of lightning victims are children or men younger than 40, which suggests to Jensenius that behavior or peer pressure plays a significant factor in who gets struck. About 85 percent of victims are men.

“Being safe is inconvenient,” he said. “I’ll add that most people struck by lightning do not die, but most are left with lifelong neurological problems.”

We talk in golf about playing safely or making the safe play in a given situation. If you’re like me, you’ve rushed to the first tee without putting on sunscreen or stayed out an extra hole or two, trying to ride out a thunderstorm. It may seem innocent, not perilous.

But these are clearly risks not worth taking.
37 2009-06-01 Even before you got into Galapagos Art Space in Dumbo, Brooklyn, on Friday night, you could tell that anticipation was running high for the final event of Undiscovered Islands, a concert series presented by the innovative record label New Amsterdam. Outside the club a line stretched around the corner. Inside, a boisterous crowd filled the space to capacity. The buzz was understandable, since the program featured new works by Missy Mazzoli and William Brittelle, two of the label’s more prominent artists.

“Song From the Uproar,” a haunting multimedia concert piece Ms. Mazzoli created with Stephen Taylor, a video artist, drew on the journals of Isabelle Eberhardt, a short-lived 19th-century Swiss explorer. Ms. Mazzoli selected clear, singable passages, setting them in melodic lines that slowly stretched and curled over melancholy harmonies and fidgety rhythms, or wafted, ghostlike, within cistern-resonant electronic passages.

Live performance and video fused with unusual potency in “This World Within Me Is Too Small,” an early scene inspired by Eberhardt’s loss of her family when she was 20. While Ms. Mazzoli’s music conjured the loneliness that prompted Eberhardt’s journeys, an old black-and-white film, doctored by Mr. Taylor, showed a small girl wandering through a backyard gathering, as adults and children around her were mysteriously erased one by one.

Abigail Fischer, a mezzo-soprano, confidently navigated a spare, cool staging by Gia Forakis, melding into grainy vistas of sand and sea spray while singing with conviction and clarity. To one side of the stage, the Now Ensemble — Alex Sopp, flutist; Sara Budde, clarinetist; Mark Dancigers, guitarist; Michael Mizrahi, pianist; and Logan Coale, bassist — accompanied Ms. Fischer with suitable restraint. All the performers were amplified and deftly mixed.

Technical difficulties marred a few songs in a preview performance of Mr. Brittelle’s “Television Landscape” — a substantial matter since Mr. Brittelle, who seriously injured his vocal cords during a performance with a punk group in 2004, was miming his own studio-recorded vocals in front of a live rock band augmented with strings, harp, woodwinds and French horns. When the glitches were ironed out, it was still hard to discern the elliptical poetry of Mr. Brittelle’s lyrics.

But the music was substantial: a riotous shotgun wedding of rich orchestrations and complex arrangements with the rock-oriented pleasures of flamboyant posturing and excessive volume, Mr. Coale’s fuzz-pedal bass lines and the bombastic precision of Ted Poor’s drumming. Where the two sides came closest together — as when Mr. Dancigers, Mohawk-coiffed and wearing a “Classical Music Is Dead” T-shirt, piloted a dive-bombing guitar solo into a plush thicket of horns — the results were irresistible.
38 2009-06-01 Music that went (almost) nowhere slowly was both methodical and mesmerizing when the Wordless Music series went ambient on Friday night at the Miller Theater. The program paired the only United States appearance of Wolfgang Voigt’s electronic project Gas with a performance of Brian Eno’s “Discreet Music” by Contact, a Toronto chamber ensemble.

In various roles — as a musician, a producer and the founder of the Kompakt electronic-music label in Cologne, Germany — and under many recording aliases, Mr. Voigt has been an architect of minimal techno since the early 1990s. That style finds dour but genuine pleasure in dry, austere sounds, including electronic glitches.

But in the mid-1990s Mr. Voigt was also drawn to more enveloping sounds and to a reconsideration of German Romanticism, particularly the swelling strings, lofty fanfares and hovering unresolved harmonies of Wagner and Mahler. Applying techno’s repetition and layering to those sounds and subduing the beat, he came up with four albums between 1996 and 2000 — and then, last year, an additional album of unreleased tracks — under the name Gas. They are grandiose and somber, deliberating from a distance over cultural memories of sublime ambition by using sampled shards and remnants, swathed in latter-day distortion.

Onstage Mr. Voigt stood in shadows at a table with a laptop and mixer; his silhouette was cast in one corner of a large video screen, like a painter’s signature. The video images were by Petra Hollenbach, using Mr. Voigt’s photography, and they were of a forest with no one in sight.

The music wafted out, edgeless and unhurried, in foreboding drones and sustained chords from what sounded like strings, brass or woodwinds. Sometimes there was a muffled underlying beat, sometimes just the undulations of overlapping loops. Surrounding them, helping blanket the frequency spectrum, was Mr. Voigt’s beloved electronic noise: rumbles, whooshes of static or quiet clicks ricocheting in stereo.

Meanwhile the video panned slowly across close-ups of branches and foliage. Plant images also multiplied into grids, proliferating and rippling until they turned trippy: nature processed through digital technology, as Mr. Voigt was processing a German heritage of sound.

64 2009-06-02 Jeter had only 48 at-bats in the major leagues when he homered against Martinez, a pitcher who won 245 games. Jeter had 15 games of experience at shortstop when he dashed into shallow center field to make the type of catch Jerry Rice would have made.

Home runs have not been a staple for Jeter, but he has long been adept at sprinting into no-man’s land in the outfield and turning dicey pop-ups into outs. After Jeter’s first opener with the Yankees, he steered the dialogue away from himself and to the team.

“In our house, you couldn’t go around talking about yourself,” Jeter said in 1996. “I really don’t like people who talk about themselves a lot. It’s all right to have confidence, but without the cockiness. I don’t talk too much about myself.”

Thirteen years later, Jeter came close to giving the same response about his attitude.

“I don’t like talking about myself,” he said. “Never have. I don’t even like people who talk about themselves. If you can do it, why do you need to talk about it?”

Numerous things have changed in Jeter’s life, but he is eerily similar in how he prepares, plays and presents himself. When asked about this, Jeter said simply: “That’s who I am. Who you are is who you are. I don’t think you should try to be someone you’re not. It’ll come back to bite you.”

Jeter’s approach was borne out of lessons from his parents, Charles and Dorothy. When the 1996 game was snowed out, Dorothy Jeter stayed here while her husband drove four hours back home to Kalamazoo, Mich., because Derek’s sister, Sharlee, had a softball game.

“She’s just as important as I am,” Jeter said at the time.

While Jeter’s future could include contentious discussions about whether he will continue to play shortstop and about his contract status, he continues to march along as a historic hitter. From Jeter’s first game with the Yankees on May 29, 1995, through May 28, 2009, he had 2,592 hits and 1,497 runs scored. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, only one other player who made his debut in the live-ball era surpassed both of Jeter’s hits and runs totals within 14 years of his debut. That was Hank Aaron, who had 2,621 hits and 1,520 runs.

As Jeter sat in the clubhouse Monday and ruminated about how similar he is to the nervous rookie who dressed in the same room in 1996, he volunteered one thing that has changed.

“They moved my locker,” said Jeter, who pointed to the locker beside his current space and added, “I used to be in that one.”
65 2009-06-02 Some NASA officials did not want reporters present. Mr. Haney did. In a compromise, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin performed the session twice, once for the officials and once for journalists.

Mr. Johnson said Mr. Haney profusely thanked the astronauts, who were exhausted by the end of the day, but said the incident was “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Mr. Slayton, who died in 1993, maintained a friendship with Mr. Haney in later life.

Mr. Haney also had disagreements with Julian Scheer, the top NASA public affairs official in Washington, although they agreed on a need for openness. Mr. Scheer died in 2001.

A few days after the clash with Mr. Slayton, Mr. Scheer told Mr. Haney to report to a new post in Washington, far from the main Apollo activities in Houston.

In an oral history recorded by the NASA Johnson Space Center in 2003, Mr. Haney recalled that he replied: “I guess I have some options here, and I choose to exercise one. I quit.”

That was only a few months before the historic moon landing.

Mr. Haney went to London, where he provided NASA commentary for the Independent Television News in Britain and wrote for The Economist.

Paul Prichard Haney was born July 20, 1928, in Akron, Ohio. He worked at night for The Associated Press while attending Kent State University. After receiving a journalism degree in 1949, he worked at several newspapers before moving to The Evening Star in Washington.

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite. The newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration was looking for public information officers. Mr. Haney signed on and started work during the week of Christmas in 1958.

In 1963, after almost leaving NASA for IBM, he became director of public affairs at Johnson, then known as the Manned Spacecraft Center. Among his duties, he provided mission commentary of the Gemini and Apollo missions through Apollo 9.

After leaving NASA, Mr. Haney worked at a variety of jobs, including handling public affairs for the Astrodome in Houston, the Port of Galveston and a broadcast lobbying group. But “he always went back to newspapering,” Mrs. Haney said.

He also worked for newspapers in Houston, Charleston, S.C., and St. Petersburg, Fla.

In 1983, he and his wife bought The Homesteader News, a small community newspaper in a town east of El Paso. Mr. Haney was the writer, editor and publisher for six and a half years.

His first marriage, to Jane Bramley, ended in divorce.

In addition to his second wife, Jan, Mr. Haney is survived by two daughters, Maura Ford and Megan Reeves, both of El Dorado Hills, Calif.; a stepson, Richard Shrum of El Paso; a sister, Mary Wilson of Stow, Ohio; and seven grandchildren.

The Haneys eventually moved to High Rolls, N.M., where they bought a cherry orchard.

“At that point, he pretty much retired,” Mrs. Haney said.

People would come to pick cherries and talk to Mr. Haney about the space program. “Oftentimes,” she said, “I had no help with the orchard, because he was talking to people.”
66 2009-06-02 CHICAGO (AP) — A federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago on Monday approved a bidding process for the Hartmarx Corporation after the company revised a takeover bid to provide more cash for its largest creditor, the Wells Fargo bank. Emerisque Brands and SKNL North America submitted an $85.5 million offer last week for the company’s assets, which Wells Fargo rejected, saying it was too low.

Hartmarx renegotiated the bid’s structure, allowing Wells Fargo to get more cash. Another hearing to approve final details was scheduled for Tuesday.

68 2009-06-02 The Times rightly asserts that Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s “up-by-the-bootstraps tale” is “one reason for her selection” by President Obama for the Supreme Court (“Woman in the News: A Trailblazer and a Dreamer,” front page, May 27).

A significant part of that compelling tale is the great value the Sotomayor family placed on higher education. Judge Sotomayor’s mother, Celina, benefited from the nursing program at the City University of New York’s Hostos Community College, which had then only recently been opened, and advanced her professional aspirations, graduating in 1973. Her brother, Juan, graduated from CUNY’s Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at City College in 1979.

CUNY has historically created new educational options for the sons and daughters of its graduates. Celina Sotomayor and her son, a graduate of New York University’s medical school, and daughter, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, are wonderful examples of the doors opened through quality public higher education.

69 2009-06-02 Four Tibetan advocacy organizations have organized a candlelight vigil in Dharamsala in memory of Chinese protesters who were killed by military forces in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. The vigil is scheduled for Wednesday, the day before the massacre’s 20th anniversary. The effort appears aimed at building an alliance with Chinese democracy advocates.
70 2009-06-02 The authorization to issue the invitations was disclosed by a senior State Department official on the eve of a three-day visit to Latin America by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the new policy was not public.

Even as the United States reaches out to Tehran, it is trying to reclaim American influence in Latin America, where Iran has made inroads while the United States has been waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was in El Salvador to attend the inauguration of Mauricio Funes, whose election as president represents the first time the country has swung to the left since its civil war ended in 1992. She will be in Honduras on Tuesday for a meeting of the Organization of American States. The United States is expected to face intense pressure from Cuba’s neighbors to reinstate the island’s membership in the group.

Mrs. Clinton has said Iran’s rising influence in the region is “quite disturbing.” In May, she told State Department employees that the Bush administration’s policy toward Latin America had created an opening for Iran and China, which are using commercial and other assistance to bolster anti-American leaders like Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.

“They are building strong economic and political connections with a lot of these leaders,” she said. “I don’t think that’s in our interest.”

While Iran’s influence in the region is dwarfed by that of China — which is a huge buyer of raw materials from Latin American countries — Tehran’s role has touched a nerve among senior administration officials like Mrs. Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has also spoken publicly about it.

“The specter of Iran raises red flags in a way that China doesn’t, because China tends to respect the American sphere of influence,” said Julia E. Sweig, a Latin American expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Iran’s motives are murkier, according to administration officials. It has cultivated wide-ranging economic ties with Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua. But it has also been linked to the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, which killed 85 people.

Iran is not known to have a big presence in El Salvador, officials said, and it was not represented at Mr. Funes’s inauguration. But the change in power after 17 years of a pro-American right-wing government could offer an opening.

Mr. Funes’s victory continues the ascension of the political left across Latin America; some analysts worry he will adopt the anti-American rhetoric of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. His party, the F.M.L.N., has its roots in guerrillas who fought El Salvador’s American-backed army in the 1980s and 1990s. But Mr. Funes is viewed as more centrist than his party. American officials said Mrs. Clinton’s presence was meant to signal that Washington would not take El Salvador for granted.

“Some might say President Obama is left of center,” Mrs. Clinton said after meeting with Mr. Funes.

Speaking earlier to American diplomats, she alluded to the vagaries of American influence in the region.

“Some of the difficulties we’ve had historically in forging strong and lasting ties in our hemisphere,” she said, “are a result of our perhaps not listening, perhaps not paying close enough attention.”
71 2009-06-02 It ended with Monfils winning, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, in 1 hour 51 minutes, which was not a minute too soon for the 11th-seeded Monfils.

“I knew that we had about one hour and a half, 1 hour and 45 minutes to play or perhaps just a bit more,” he said. “It was a bit stressful, but I’m happy to have pulled it off.”

The reward for his remarkable time management and performance is a rematch with Roger Federer, the highest-ranked man remaining in the tournament. Last year, Federer handled Monfils in four sets in the semifinals. This year, they will meet in the quarterfinals in a match that will surely put a temporary end to Federer’s being the sentimental favorite of the French crowd.

“We’re in France; I’m French,” Monfils said. “He’s a great player and somebody I respect a lot. I know that in his mind, he has a strong hand to play here now that Nadal the favorite is not here. But I’m not going to give anything away, Roger. I’m sorry.”

Monfils, who is a passionate fan of the N.B.A. and wore a LeBron James jersey after his victory, certainly gave nothing away to Roddick. As he skidded and sprinted about, it was difficult to believe he had missed nearly all of the clay-court season and seriously considered not playing here because of chronic pain in his swollen left knee.

But undergoing intense therapy and gritting his teeth are working so far. With his abbreviated service motion, Monfils hit 17 aces to 4 for Roddick, still considered the game’s premier server. Monfils finished with 45 winners and nearly half as many unforced errors (23), and he transformed many of Roddick’s tactically justified forays to the net into exhibition space for his own defensive talents.

Roddick won just 12 of the 30 points when he pushed to the net, and if he was not getting passed or lobbed, he was mistiming overheads or volleys in the gloaming.

“It was difficult,” Roddick said of the visibility. “But I think a lot more of it has to do with him being probably at least in the argument of the best athlete we’ve seen play this game.”

Roddick had not dropped his serve or a set in his first three matches, but Monfils represented too big a step up. Positioning himself deep behind the baseline to return, Monfils broke Roddick’s serve six times and allowed him to win only 58 percent of the points on his first serve, a remarkably low figure for the American.

“Basically, you know, I want to shorten the court, and he’s trying to lengthen the court,” Roddick said. “So that’s the battle that took place.”

Instead, it turned into a short match. Roddick can now leave the clay and make the shift to the grass and to Wimbledon, where reaching the second week would be no novelty.
72 2009-06-02 Of course, making predictions about G.M.’s reorganization, with all the political interest and concerns about the company’s role in the economy, is tricky, lawyers cautioned. The company’s size and its international reach will complicate a process that the government hopes to complete in no more than three months.

“We are really headed into uncharted territory,” said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “Any bankruptcy judge is going to look at this and expect it to explode.”

Judge Gerber, 62, has been willing to take potentially controversial steps to move big cases along. In the Chapter 11 proceedings of Lyondell Chemical Company this year, he approved a financing arrangement that allowed lenders to convert some of the prebankruptcy debt they held into a higher priority postfiling obligation.

That bodes well for any effort by the federal government to get the loans already extended to G.M. to be treated as higher priority obligations after the filing, said Stephen J. Lubben, a law professor at Seton Hall.

In the Adelphia bankruptcy, the judge approved a $17.6 billion sale of the company to Time Warner and Comcast, using the same kind of auction procedure drawn on by Chrysler in its sale to Fiat. That sale procedure, under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code, may also be an important part of any reorganization of G.M., lawyers said.

Judge Gerber also worked the lawyers in the Adelphia case hard, Mr. Friedman said. “He kept his courtroom open on at least one circumstance, and I think there were more, well past midnight in order to complete a hearing that was critical to the company’s survival,” he recalled.

In that case, the judge produced dozens of opinions, some of them lengthy and at least one scathing, said Edward R. Morrison, a law professor at Columbia. Judge Gerber slammed a group of creditors, accusing them of pursuing “scorched-earth litigation strategy,” after they raised objections that could have hindered the sale to Time Warner and Comcast.

That kind of blunt language is not common in judicial opinions, Professor Morrison said, and it may be a sign of some sympathy toward those trying to get a case concluded more quickly.

“But perhaps this was an unusual case in which the hedge funds were more aggressive,” Professor Morrison added. “It’s hard to know.”

A graduate of Rutgers and Columbia Law School, Judge Gerber interrupted his private practice to serve about two years in the Air Force before he was appointed to the bankruptcy bench in 2000. While practicing, he handled securities and commercial litigation before moving into bankruptcy work.

Not surprisingly, in the small world of big bankruptcy lawyers, no one had a harsh word to say about Judge Gerber on Monday. Many lawyers will appear before him in the G.M. case, after all, and many others will down the road.
73 2009-06-02 What drove General Motors into bankruptcy? It’s tempting to blame the broader financial crisis, which torpedoed the United States economy, dragged down car sales and shut carmakers out of the capital markets. That overriding factor certainly precipitated the demise of America’s largest carmaker, but it was not the ultimate cause.

Insolvency has, in fact, been looming over G.M. for several years. In April 2005, for example, while markets were worrying about rating agencies downgrading the carmaker’s debt, G.M.’s onerous unfunded health care and pension liabilities looked to have punched a multibillion-dollar hole in its balance sheet. Even then, some suggested that a filing for Chapter 11 protection might be the only way to get G.M. back on track.

That’s not to say G.M.’s executives sat back and did nothing. In the last four years they have halved the union work force in the United States; laid off white-collar employees in droves; renegotiated labor contracts and health care expenses; and sold businesses like Allison Transmission and GMAC, the financial services arm, to raise cash.

But none of that was enough. G.M. was losing market share faster than it could shrink its operations, even before the precipitous declines of the more recent credit crisis. Other measures were slow to materialize, like a cut in its the dividend. And other options were shunned as taboo by its then-chief, Rick Wagoner, including the closing or sale of some of G.M.’s crowd of eight brands.

While on government life support and under imminent threat of bankruptcy this last year, G.M. executives moved too slowly. Twice they had to revise rosy assumptions for their restructuring plan.

Still, even for those who have argued strongly in favor of G.M. seeking bankruptcy protection, there’s no pleasure in being proved right. The generous support of American and Canadian taxpayers, whose $60 billion or more in loans are unlikely to be repaid in full — as well as some luck — will help. And G.M.’s expedited bankruptcy process will allow it to emerge in a position to compete profitably again. If not, another bankruptcy will be in the cards.
74 2009-06-02 Bindella, a family-owned group, employs about 500 people in a chain that includes an exclusive restaurant called Bindella, midpriced restaurants known as Santa Lucia and a number of modestly priced restaurants called the Spaghetti Factory. Italian cuisine, Mr. Müller said, “is almost Swiss cuisine; it’s a big, integrated part of our life.”

Restaurants that are not Italian are recognizing that they have to compete with Mediterranean cuisine. In an advertisement on billboards around Zurich, for example, McDonald’s shows a large juicy cheeseburger and its price, about $2.25, with the words, “Four tortellini, or this.”

“Everybody has suffered to some extent,” said Urs P. Roth, chief executive of the Swiss Bankers Association, gazing from his office above the Limmat River at the banking center. Mr. Roth was general counsel at UBS, when it was profitable.

The health of banks is no academic matter, for banks are to Switzerland what lobsters are to coastal Maine. About a quarter of a million Swiss work in finance, about 40 percent of them in the Zurich area.

Even so, in some traditional Swiss restaurants, well-known bankers have been booed out of the house; one brasserie even turned away an illustrious banker client.

While he was chairman of the board at UBS, Marcel Ospel dined regularly on Wednesday evenings at his favorite restaurant, the Kronenhalle, an old brasserie near the opera house where paintings by Matisse, Picasso and Miró adorn the walls. Yet last year, after Mr. Ospel announced that UBS had lost more than $19 billion, the Kronenhalle made him feel he was persona non grata, according to Swiss news media reports. Only recently has he begun to visit the restaurant again.

But the restaurants that are not turning the bankers away are the Italians, which have displaced the Chinese as the largest group of restaurants in the city that do not serve up Swiss dishes. Asked where he eats when he goes out, Mr. Roth of the Bankers Association replied, “If I’m with clients, I go to local restaurants around the office; if I’m alone and just want to relax, I go to Il Giglio.”

Mr. Giglio, for one, is not mystified by the bankers’ sudden taste for Italian cuisine. Like another Italian specialty, it is soothing, he said: “Like the music of a tenor. For lots of music has been written for tenors; for Caruso, Pavarotti.”

And yet, on a recent evening when a banker and a lawyer were complaining loudly over their pasta about their banking losses, Mr. Giglio said, a diner at a neighboring table leaped to his feet and loudly upbraided them. “He told them it was not they, the bankers, who were losing money; it was paupers like him,” he said.

“Giglio’s is a place you can go to in good times and bad,” said Jan A. Bielinski, 55, of Bank Julius Bar, an exclusive private bank just off the Bahnhofstrasse. “The mood has changed,” he said over coffee. “The moods change when the market changes, and a bad market influences everybody.”

Mr. Müller of Bindella agrees with Mr. Giglio about the soothing factor in Italian food. Leisurely dining is fading in Switzerland, he said, where life is increasingly rushed. “Here you have the feeling of being on vacation,” he said, picking at calamari and polenta at the Café Terrasse, one of his group’s newest restaurants, in a hall that once housed a striptease club.

Even at the very top, some Italian restaurants are prospering. Over at the Savoy Baur en Ville, the exclusive five-star hotel on the Paradeplatz, the center of Zurich finance, Manfred J. Hörger operates Orsini, the restaurant where the Piccatine di Vitello alla Milanese, or veal Milanese, costs a diner $47.

Mr. Hörger, 67, who has run the hotel for decades with his wife, Christina, says the most important element in Italian cooking is continuity. “A guest came in recently from Basel and said, ‘I’d like the Ravioli della Nonna,’ ” Mr. Hörger said. “And we had taken it off the menu.”

Mr. Hörger ordered it returned immediately. “What marks us is continuity,” he said proudly.
75 2009-06-02 As General Motors went into bankruptcy protection on Monday, Delphi, a former unit of the giant automaker, disclosed a new plan to leave it.

Delphi, an auto parts supplier that has languished in bankruptcy for nearly four years, said on Monday that it had reached an agreement to sell most of its assets to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm specializing in distressed companies.

The deal has the backing of the federal government, and Delphi’s fate weighed heavily on the carmaker, because a liquidation of the supplier — long considered a possibility — would have dealt G.M., still a major customer, a severe blow.

As part of the proposed deal, G.M. will buy back certain Delphi businesses, including its steering parts operations. G.M. will also provide Delphi with $250 million in capital to keep it afloat through July 31.

“After an extended period of complex and challenging discussions with a wide range of stakeholders, we are confident that these modifications to our confirmed plan of reorganization will provide a resolution that will allow Delphi to emerge from Chapter 11,” Rodney O’Neal, Delphi’s chief executive, said in a statement.
76 2009-06-02 WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide what sorts of business methods might be patented, an issue with the potential to reshape significant parts of the economy.

“This is the most important patent case in 50 years, in particular because there is so much damage and so much good the court could do,” said John F. Duffy, a law professor at George Washington University who submitted a brief in the appeals court in support of neither side.

“The newest areas of technology are most threatened by the issues at stake here,” Professor Duffy said. “The court taking this is likely to make a lot of people nervous, including software manufacturers and biotechnology companies.”

In October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington significantly narrowed the processes eligible for patent protection, ruling that only those “tied to a particular machine or apparatus” or transforming “a particular article into a different state or thing” qualified.

The petitioners in the case, Bernard L. Bilski and Rand A. Warsaw, had sought to patent a method of hedging risks in the sale of commodities, including the risks associated with bad weather. The appeals court ruled against them, and it disavowed statements in earlier cases suggesting that business processes could be patented so long as they yielded useful, concrete and tangible results.
77 2009-06-02 LOS ANGELES — Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking.

In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.

Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.

More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.

Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.

Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around.
78 2009-06-02 Most people know what precautions to take to protect their skin at the beach this summer: slather on the sunscreen, reapply as needed and take breaks in the shade as often as possible.

But few people know that a number of common medications can intensify the effects of sunlight, greatly raising the risk of burning, rashes and other skin problems, even after only a little time in the sun. Studies show that this can happen in at least two ways.

One, known as a photoallergic reaction, occurs when a certain medicine or substance is applied to the skin. Ultraviolet light from the sun transforms the substance in a way that provokes the immune system, leading to irritated skin and eczemalike rashes. The onset of visible symptoms is usually delayed 24 hours to several days.

Far more common is a phenomenon called phototoxic reaction. It occurs when a person ingests the drug or substance in question, then spends time in the sun. Exposing the skin to ultraviolet rays excites molecules of the ingested substance, causing damage to tissue  severe redness and sunburn, for example  that is almost immediately apparent.

The list of drugs that can cause sun sensitivity is long, but among the most common culprits are antibiotics like tetracycline, certain antihistamines and topical antimicrobials. The best remedy is either to limit the use of the offending substance or to take extra precautions, like wearing protective clothing.

Many drugs can raise a person’s sensitivity to sunlight.
79 2009-06-02 Banks have been sparring with the Obama administration and lawmakers for months over how quickly they may repay bailout money. The government has prohibited the banks from reimbursing it unless they can prove they are healthy enough to raise money in the capital markets on their own, to avoid having to dole out a new round of support should the recession deepen.

In recent months, many of the strongest banks began jockeying to demonstrate their ability to repay the government’s money. As the credit markets have improved, they are now issuing debt without guarantees from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And all eight big banks that received bailout money and passed the government’s stress tests have also raised capital by voluntarily selling common stock to private investors, even though regulators did not require them to do so. JPMorgan Chase and American Express, which announced a similar $500 million offering on Monday, were the last in that group.

Early repayment of these funds, and of warrants the government received from banks last fall, may mean less of a return to the taxpayer for rescuing the banks. But it will have the benefit of letting the government rechannel some of the money in the $700 billion bailout program to other smaller banks that need it.

Even before the stress test results were released, bank officials had been pressing their regulators to let them repay the money. Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation and U.S. Bancorp have already sent their regulators letters of intent to repay the government, a federal official briefed on the situation said.

Morgan Stanley said Tuesday morning that it planned to raise $2.2 billion in common equity to bring it closer to repaying its loans from the federal government. In a statement, the bank said that some of the additional shares would be acquired by existing Morgan Stanley shareholders, including the China Investment Corporation and the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.

And the Bank of America said in a statement that it had raised almost $33 billion of the $33.9 billion required by regulators after last month’s stress tests.

“If we didn’t get out of TARP, we’d be very surprised,” Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said Monday, although he acknowledged the government could still change its criteria. “Obviously, you know, they can do anything they want,” he said.

On Monday, the Federal Reserve added a new requirement that big banks seeking to repay the government sell a sizable amount of common stock to private investors. A similar list last month included requirements on borrowing money without government backing and maintaining an extra capital cushion to protect against a worsening economy.

Regulators expect to review the applications over the next few days and decide next week. But even banks that repay the money could face another showdown with federal officials. To fully extricate themselves from government, they will have to either allow the Treasury to auction off warrants that taxpayers received last fall or buy them back themselves.

If they repurchase the warrants, the move could cost the banks billions of dollars. Taxpayer warrants in JPMorgan Chase, for example, are valued at least $1.6 billion, according to some estimates.

Mr. Dimon said that he did not know how much they would wind up costing the bank, although he argued the government should cancel half “out of fairness” since new restrictions and a change in public perception had stigmatized the program. A few small banks have sought to reduce the amount they need to pay the government for their warrants.
80 2009-06-02 Re “Referral System Turns Patients Into Commodities” (Essay, May 25): Dr. Sandeep Jauhar suggests that a single payment to the doctor per year per patient would remove the financial incentive to provide unnecessary care. However, such a payment shifts the underwriting of health care to the doctor and provides a financial incentive for the doctor to provide less care — exactly the situation that we criticize the insurance companies for in the current system.

Additionally, in the absence of the large reserves required of insurance companies, the incentive for the doctor to provide less care would be immediate and very powerful.
81 2009-06-02 “We found a strong association between frequent changes of residence and suicidal behavior among children,” Dr. Qin said.

But, she added, “We could not distinguish whether the mobility was a causal risk factor or merely an intermediate variable of other risk factors.”

The study was published on Monday in the June issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.

The report corroborates earlier studies that have found an association between frequent mobility and children’s mental health. But the new report goes further, because it used actual medical records rather than self-reported survey data and looked at moves throughout childhood rather than just at recent moves, said Dr. Scott J. South, professor of sociology at the University at Albany, State University of New York, who was not involved in the Danish study but has studied the impact of frequent moves on children.

“The evidence is becoming quite compelling that there is a causal effect of children’s residential mobility on a variety of negative behavioral outcomes,” Dr. South said. “[The children] do worse in school, they are more likely to drop out of high school, and I published a study that found they’re more likely to engage in sexual behavior earlier.”

Dr. Qin and her colleagues used several databases in Denmark — including a hospital registry, a psychiatric registry and a civil registration system that requires citizens to inform authorities any time they change addresses — to identify 4,160 children and teens who had visited a hospital between 1995 and 2006 following a suicide attempt. Another 79 children who had committed suicide were also identified.

Some 55 percent of the more than 4,000 children and teens ages 11 to 17 who sought medical help at a hospital for a suicide attempt had changed residences more than three times, while less than one-third, or 32 percent, of similar children in a control group had moved more than three times.

Of the suicidal children, 7.4 percent had moved more than 10 times, compared with 1.9 percent of the control group, researchers found.

Each of the suicidal children was matched with 30 controls of the same sex and age living in Denmark who were randomly drawn from the population for comparison. Researchers adjusted the data to account for other factors that may have influenced the children’s psychosocial well-being, including whether they had lost a parent or had a history of mental illness.

The researchers did not adjust for poverty, family instability or for the distances moved.

Among the much smaller number of teens and pre-teens who had completed a suicide, a significant association with frequent moves was seen only in adolescents who had moved at least six times, the researchers found.

Teens and pre-teens who had moved 6 to 10 times were almost three times more likely to complete a suicide.

“Little research has addressed the influence of mobility of children’s psychosocial well-being,” Dr. Qin said, adding that adolescence is an inherently turbulent time for children, so moves may be more traumatic. Moves at this age are also unlikely to be the child’s decision, and parents may be too distracted by their own adjustments to pay close attention to a child’s needs, Dr. Qin said.

“Moving from one place to another can result in a breakdown of connections to peer friends, and distress and worries about the new environment,” she said. “All of these factors can be stressful.”
82 2009-06-02 In the waning days of April, as federal officials were declaring a public health emergency and the world seemed gripped by swine flu panic, two rival supercomputer teams made projections about the epidemic that were surprisingly similar — and surprisingly reassuring. By the end of May, they said, there would be only 2,000 to 2,500 cases in the United States.

May’s over. They were a bit off.

On May 15, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were “upwards of 100,000” cases in the country, even though only 7,415 had been confirmed at that point.

The agency declines to update that estimate just yet. But Tim Germann, a computational scientist who worked on a 2006 flu forecast model at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said he imagined there were now “a few hundred thousand” cases. (At their peaks, epidemics are thought to double in as little as three days, which could drive the number into the millions, but Dr. Germann said he would not use such a rapid doubling rate unless it was a cold November and no countermeasures, like closing schools, were being taken.)

The leaders of both the Northwestern University and Indiana University teams seemed a bit abashed when they were asked that last week.

Northwestern’s predictions got the most publicity because of the eye-catching metric for predicting spread: data from Where’s George?, a Web site that tracks millions of dollar bills as they move around the country.
83 2009-06-02 Mr. Frank said the idea of a single agency “would be a good one if you were starting from scratch.” But he said it simply wasn’t “worth the political cost” that it would inevitably entail.

Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, another senior Democrat in regular discussions with the administration, said there appeared to be a consensus among senior officials that there were too many bank regulators, but the debate in recent days had centered on whether it was politically wise to propose a plan that might face significant opposition in Congress.

“The question is whether they should put down the ideal plan and whether they should make the political compromises before they issue the plan or after,” Mr. Schumer said. The administration has been strongly considering abolishing the O.T.S., which regulates savings associations. (The O.T.S. was the primary federal regulator for A.I.G. because the company bought a small savings association a decade ago.) Its elimination was proposed last year by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the idea has gained political currency since then.

“The Office of Thrift Supervision has very little political support given its track record,” Mr. Schumer said.

A merger of two other federal agencies — the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — would face fierce political resistance. In recent years, both agencies have been accused of weak oversight. But the industries regulated by the agencies have traditionally opposed a merger, and the Congressional committees with jurisdiction over each agency historically have been reluctant to cede any authority.

Mr. Frank and Mr. Dodd said they expected the House would move first on legislation and could complete a package of measures by the August recess, which would then go to the Senate for consideration. Unlike many other measures, regulatory overhaul does not break along party lines as much as along regional lines. The views of lawmakers from states with big banks and financial institutions often differ from those with smaller institutions.

A central goal of the plan is to more tightly control companies that are now largely unregulated but could pose risks to the financial system if they failed, such as hedge funds. Under the proposal, hedge funds would be required to register with the S.E.C. and provide access to their books. Many hedge funds already do so.

Administration officials were considering this week how to resolve many of the crucial details of the plan, such as whether the umbrella regulator for systemic risk should be the Federal Reserve alone, as Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, had previously suggested, or whether it should be a council of regulators.

Another difficult and unresolved question is how the federal government should more aggressively regulate insurance companies, which are now exclusively under the supervision of a patchwork of state agencies.

As part of its overhaul, the Obama administration announced three weeks ago that it would seek new authority over the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, which were a major cause of the financial crisis and have gone largely unregulated for decades. While some in Congress are pushing for tougher oversight, the financial industry is lobbying hard against it, arguing that too much regulation would thwart financial innovation. On Thursday, Gary Gensler, the new chairman of the C.F.T.C., is expected to provide more details about that proposal at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.

For years, the debate over how to regulate such instruments has been mired in disagreement between the C.F.T.C. and the S.E.C., reflecting the rivalries between markets in Chicago and New York. But officials said this week that Mr. Gensler and Mary L. Schapiro, his counterpart at the S.E.C., had reached an informal understanding that would enable their respective agencies to share authority over the derivatives market.

The understanding, which the regulators hope Congress will ultimately ratify, would essentially give the S.E.C. authority over derivatives that are related to publicly traded securities and other instruments under the S.E.C.’s jurisdiction, such as credit-default swaps, while the C.F.T.C. would oversee commodities-based derivatives, the officials said.
84 2009-06-02 Q. What happens to G.M. dealers?

A. G.M. is able under bankruptcy to cancel franchise agreements with its dealers. It has already announced plans to eliminate 1,100 dealers and may cut more. The company wants those dealers to close within 18 months. Dealers can sue to block the action, but a final decision would be up to the judge. In the meantime, G.M. will continue to provide dealers with vehicles.

GMAC, with support from the government, will provide financing for G.M. customers. It is also providing financing for Chrysler.

Q. What’s the biggest difference between the G.M. and Chrysler cases?

A. Chrysler had reached an agreement to sell assets to Fiat before its case began. G.M. is trying to restructure on its own, with financing from the Treasury. The Treasury is providing G.M. with $30 billion in debtor-in-possession financing so it can operate while in bankruptcy, in addition to about $20 billion G.M. has already received. It is likely the Treasury will provide more scrutiny and guidance in the G.M. case, since such a large amount of taxpayer money is at stake.

Q. What happens to G.M. employees?

A. G.M. employees who are not union members do not have any job security. The company can ask a judge for an immediate pay cut for its salaried employees, and can announce job cuts and close offices, just as it can outside bankruptcy,

Contracts covering members of the United Automobile Workers union and other unions will remain in force, unless the company asks a judge to void them. But U.A.W. members approved changes last week, and the new G.M. is expected to honor that contract.

A. The White House said Sunday that, assuming the sale went forward, G.M. workers’ pensions and health care benefits would transfer to the new company and remain in force.

Companies have the right under bankruptcy law to ask to terminate their pension plans. If pensions were terminated, employees would receive reduced benefits through financing from the federal pension agency.

A company can also eliminate retiree health care benefits for nonunion employees; they would subsequently be covered by Medicare if they were 65 or older.

Q. What happens to G.M. suppliers?

A. The White House said supplier contracts would remain in force, and it has created a program to provide federal help to parts makers. But in bankruptcy, supplier contracts can be canceled.

G.M. is likely to tell the court which suppliers it wants to keep doing business with and which contracts it wants to reject. Suppliers can challenge the rejection of their contract, but most likely they will have to reach a settlement with G.M.

Q. Will the warranty for G.M. vehicles be honored?

A. Yes. The Treasury Department has already said it will stand behind warranties for cars purchased during the restructuring period for both G.M. and Chrysler. And G.M. itself said that it would honor existing warranties. If you own, say, a Saturn and the company ultimately does away with the brand, other G.M. dealers will perform the repairs.

Q. Are any current stockholder’s shares worthless? What options exist for stockholders?

A. Sell, if you possibly can.

The shares will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange beginning on Tuesday. But the stock is likely to trade, in a limited fashion, on the Pink Sheets, an electronic quotation system for companies that do not meet the listing standards for the stock exchanges.

Most shareholders are typically wiped out in bankruptcy, financial planners said, which is why G.M. stockholders should probably dump their shares if they can. Warren F. McIntyre, a financial planner in Troy, Mich., said that many people “don’t realize that usually a new share class is issued and the holders of the old shares are wiped out.”

But getting rid of the stock may be difficult, and if you have too few shares, the brokerage commission alone may wipe out any proceeds from the sale.

If you have the actual stock certificates, you might try to sell them on eBay. You may be able to get more for them as collector’s items. It’s worth a shot.

A. The value of G.M. cars will probably fall faster than it would have absent bankruptcy. How much further the value falls will depend on the model, the year, economic conditions in the future and how the company handles itself in bankruptcy.

Q. What will happen to the Hummer brand, servicing for owners and buying out a leased Hummer?

A. There’s some good news here. It appears that G.M. will be able to sell the Hummer brand and all of its dealers to another company. If this happens, the new company will aim for a seamless transition. It probably won’t be seamless, but it most likely will beat the alternative, which is G.M.’s dropping the brand altogether.

Q. Is G.M. still going to honor recall notices?

A. They’d be crazy not to, but we can’t confirm this yet. Here’s what Kelly Cusinato, a G.M. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message: “We understand that customers have many questions. As you know though, there are certain things we cannot answer until the judge makes rulings.”

Keep an eye on http://gm.com/restructuring for more information as it becomes available. Or call (866) 405-4005, though so far the people answering the phones there seem to be mostly reading off scripts or from the Web site.

Q. Why would anyone buy a G.M. product during bankruptcy?

A. Some of the cars are going to be real bargains. A dealer being forced to close will want to get rid of inventory quickly. Or, if you visit a dealer with nearby Japanese or German competition, that dealer needs to move the metal.

Anyone worried about disappearing dealers and parts shortages could hedge a bit by buying one of the few G.M. cars with above-average reliability ratings.
85 2009-06-02 If you have the actual stock certificates, you may try and sell them on eBay. You may be able to get more as a collector’s item. It’s worth a shot.

Q. We own a G.M. car and have a question. Will the warranty be honored? — Bob Diehl

A. Yes. The Treasury Department has already said it will stand behind warranties for cars purchased during the restructuring period for both G.M. and Chrysler. And G.M. itself says that it will honor your existing warranty. If you own, say, a Saturn and the company ultimately does away with the brand, other G.M. dealers will perform the repairs.

The question is, how much friction will there be. If your dealer disappears, how much farther will you have to drive to get warranty service? G.M. also says that replacement parts are and will continue to be available. It’s not clear how the company can say that with such certainty, however, with many parts suppliers in bankruptcy themselves or on the brink of it. That said, many of those suppliers service many manufacturers. So sporadic parts shortages or waits to get parts may happen no matter what kind of car you buy or own.

Q. I have accumulated several thousand dollars of credit toward a G.M. vehicle purchase from my G.M. Rewards MasterCard. Will this credit be lost because of the GM bankruptcy? — David A. Mickelson

A. No. The company has asked the bankruptcy court to maintain the G.M. card program.

Q. Should I be concerned that my Impala, my Impala SS and my Lumina will be worth less now that G.M. is in bankruptcy? Will I be able to write down any value loss on my federal income tax return next year as the bankruptcy was forced by the Obama White House? — John Howlett

A. Yes. The value of your cars will probably fall faster than it would have absent bankruptcy. How much further it falls will depend on the model, the year, economic conditions going forward and how the company handles itself in bankruptcy. As for the tax break, while we admire the ingenuity and the subtle bit of social commentary, it isn’t likely to happen.

Q. What will happening to the Hummer brand, servicing for owners, and buying out a leased Hummer? — Bruce Rosenthal, Rumson, N.J.

A. There’s some good news here. It appears as if G.M. will be able to sell the Hummer brand and all of its dealers to another company. If this happens, the new company would aim for a seamless transition. It probably wouldn’t be seamless, but it most likely beats the alternative, which is G.M. shuttering the brand altogether. Then resale values would probably fall even further, and you’d need to go to another G.M. dealer for warranty service. Maybe the old Hummer mechanics would land at other G.M. dealers and offer expert service on your vehicle there, but maybe they wouldn’t.

Q. I’m having trouble finding a factory guide for my new Pontiac G8, since the company doesn’t seem to have published it yet. Should I expect to wait even longer for it now that the company is in bankruptcy? — Mike Pitt, El Cajon, Calif.

A. I think that’s a safe bet. There are a lot of distracted people at headquarters right now, plus they’re likely to fire a bunch more white-collar workers. Have you asked your dealer for information, though? The people there might know something about this, or know how to get the answer. Readers who have ideas about this (or any other answers) can share them with us by e-mail.

Q. The government will honor the warranty on G.M. vehicles, but what about accidents caused by a defect in the vehicle? Will G.M. be accountable to those who are injured because of product defects? Will the government? — Sherlyn Manson, Lenexa, Kan.

Q. I own a Chevrolet pickup which still has a pending recall notice I have not yet had time to have installed. Is G.M. still going to honor recall notices? — Bob Jones, Carrollton, Tex.

A. They’d be crazy not to. But we can’t confirm this yet. Here’s what Kelly Cusinato, a G.M. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message when we put these questions to her: “We understand that customers have many questions. As you know though, there are certain things we cannot answer until the judge makes rulings. Again, we are committed to keeping customers informed as we go through this process. I am sorry but this is all we can offer at this time.”

Q. I am an investor in G.M. LEAP options (derivatives). I would like to know what happens to them if G.M. is delisted from the N.Y.S.E.? Also, what does the G.M. management have in mind for the G.M. shareholders? — Rahul Mukerjee, Plano, Tex.

A. Once the stock stops trading, the underlying options will also stop trading. But your right to exercise the option does not cease, said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. “You can continue to exercise the option right through the expiration date,” he added.

Exercising the options gives you the right to buy or sell the shares at a certain “strike price.” But Mr. Schwartz notes that the lowest strike price for June is $1. The shares are currently trading at 73 cents, which means your options are currently “underwater” — you can get a better deal on the open market.

So, if you need the shares, for instance, to cover a short position, you’re better off buying the stock on the open market and forgetting about your options.

But as long as they are trading, you should sell out your position as soon as you possibly can. “As long as it is trading and has some value, sell it,” Mr. Schwartz said.

Run, don’t walk. Shares of the company will stop trading on Tuesday, according to the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock may continue to trade on what’s known as the “Pink Sheets,” an electronic quotation system for companies that do not meet the listing standards for the stock exchanges. But even if it didn’t trade anywhere, you could still exercise your options, Mr. Schwartz added. But no new or “opening” trades are permitted, according to the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

Q. I have preferred stock in G.M. What happens to my stock, and more importantly, what will happen to me? Do I have no alternative except to keep the stock until I am dead and gone (I am a young 55) and transfer the stock in a will to my heirs? — Denise D., Seattle

Q. I own G.M. preferred shares. Should I be looking to sell them, or hold on? I bought them at $25 a share when they were issued in late 2001. — Karen, Manhattan

A. When a company files for bankruptcy, its various stock and bondholders essentially get in line. The first investors to be repaid are secured debt holders, then senior bond investors, followed by subordinated debt holders. Preferred shareholders are next, and lastly, holders of common stock.

In a bankruptcy, preferred shares are usually worthless, much like shares of common stock. But in the case of G.M., there may be some good — or at least somewhat better — news. Most of G.M.’s preferred shares are actually senior notes or “quarterly interest bonds,” which means you will be treated as a bondholder, according to Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management. So you will be able to exchange your preferreds for G.M. stock (bondholders will receive 10 percent of the new company’s stock). It’s not the best deal, but it beats the empty bag true preferred shareholders would have been left holding.

And Karen, Ms. Cohen believes you are holding senior notes that were sold at $25 apiece in 2001.

Q. Will it be possible that the NEW General Motors can build a car of the quality and durability of Toyota, Honda, Acura, Infiniti, Nissan and others known for their reliability? Will it be possible to get a warranty combined with the service that these Japanese companies have provided for the past 40 years? — Ray Bayles, Green Valley, Ariz.

A. Well, why not? There are all sorts of American industries that manage to produce world-class products. And there’s nothing like a near-death experience to scare a company straight. G.M.’s chief executive, Fritz Henderson, said in his news conference on Monday that gone are the days when the company can foist 15 cars on the world and hope that five of them end up working out. “Give us another chance,” he said. “The G.M. that let too many of you down is history.”

So it’s possible. But whether I’d buy a car from the company right now is a whole nother question. Which someone has helpfully asked next.

Q. Why would anyone buy a G.M. product during bankruptcy? — Warren Ruder, Phoenix

A. (Ron Lieber)_ I wondered the same thing after Rick Wagoner, then G.M.’s chief executive, insisted that nobody would buy the company’s cars if it went into bankruptcy. I was so curious that I wrote a column about it. And now, we’ll get to see if he was right.

Here’s one reason to buy. Some of the cars are going to be really cheap. So, let’s say you go to a dealer that G.M. is forcing to close its doors. That dealer probably wants to get rid of its inventory quickly and just be done with it. Or, let’s say you’re visiting a dealer situated on a stretch of highway with plenty of Japanese and German competition. The dealers at those competitors are doing a lot of trash-talking right now. And if you’re a G.M. dealer that doesn’t want to get cut in the next round of dealer death sentences, you need to put money on the hood right now to survive (and counter the nasty talk down the highway).

If you’re worried about disappearing dealers and part shortages, then you could hedge a bit by buying a G.M. car with (way) above average initial and long-term reliability ratings.

Q. Is Ford going to try to capitalize on the G.M. bankruptcy by offering special deals to G.M. customers? Joseph A. Kinney, Pinehurst, N.C.

A. Wouldn’t you if you were a Ford dealer? Officially, the company is trying to be gentlemanly. And there don’t seem to be any special offers aimed squarely at G.M. or Chrysler customers. (Anyone know anything different? Let us know.) But if I’m a Ford dealer right now doing my own thing far away from headquarters, you can bet I’m filling potential customers’ heads with all sorts of doubts about what is going to happen to G.M. and Chrysler dealers, raising the possibility of parts shortages, mouthing off about how distracted the two companies’ designers and engineers must be right now, and all of the rest. If you want to buy American and sleep at night, they’re undoubtedly saying right now, then buy a Ford.

In which case, I’d tell them this: Match the deals and discounts that the G.M. and Chrysler are offering right now, and then we’ll talk.

Q. My husband is executor of his father’s estate, which includes a G.M. bond. I would like to know where we can find out more about the process taking place and how it is likely to affect this small investment in the company.— Tucker Respess, Charlottesville, Va.

Q. I owned a G.M. bond (relatively small denomination) for 15 years. To meet the May 26 deadline I opted to keep the bond rather than accept the offer for a stake in the future company. After hearing of the extended deadline to May 30 and reading about that the big bondholders were accepting the 10 percent stake, I tried to change my decision and to accept the stake for the bond. I was told by my broker that the extension only applied to large bondholders like institutions. Was I misinformed? What is the likely value of my bond? — David Wallace, Massachusetts

Q. As a bondholder who did not agree to the settlement, where do I stand? — G. Hurn, Lady Lake, Fla.

A. All bondholders would be able to exchange their bonds for fresh stock in the new G.M.: bondholders will get 10 percent of the new company’s equity, with warrants that could allow them to receive another 15 percent.

But how much is that in real dollars? Nobody really knows yet. “Over time, if the economy turns around, and if G.M. produces cars that people want to buy, and if you live long enough, the stock will probably go up,” said Marilyn Cohen of Envision Capital Management. “If you are not a risk taker, get out and put your money elsewhere.”

On Monday, most of G.M.’s intermediate-term bonds were selling anywhere from $130 to $150 (for bonds with a $1,000 face value), Ms. Cohen said. “All of the news is baked into the bond price,” she added. Keep in mind that your G.M. bond’s coupon payments will stop.

Q. Bondholders would receive only 10 percent equity plus warrants to purchase 15 percent more under certain conditions in exchange for their claims of $27 billion. Meanwhile, the Treasury will receive 60 percent equity in exchange for its investment of only $20 billion. This is obviously unfair. Are bankruptcy courts likely to approve this obviously distorted distribution? (The unions also would get a hugely disproportionate distribution.) — Allan R. Drebin, Evanston, Ill.

A. Is it fair that the taxpayers are bailing out these companies to begin with? The question of fairness is a debate for the ages. Regardless, the distribution plans are probably final. Why? Since the Treasury is providing G.M. with such a huge sum of money so it can operate while it’s in bankruptcy ($30 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, in addition to the $20 billion it already received), the government is likely to keep a tighter grip on the proceedings.

“The government is in the drivers seat in bankruptcy court due to the significant amount of restructuring funding provided to G.M.,” said Gary Cloud, a senior portfolio manager with the AFBA Funds. “Therefore, it is unlikely that challenges to the final equity apportionment to G.M. creditors will change dramatically from the current blueprint.”

Q. My OnStar contract is up for renewal in a few weeks. What is the effect of the G.M. bankruptcy on On-Star? — Ellen, Palos Park, Ill.

A. G.M. says that there will be no impact on OnStar service, and that subscriptions will remain in place. Given that this service is, arguably, one of the best products of any sort that the company has come up with in the last decade or two, there’s little chance that it’s going away or changing much.
86 2009-06-02 GAZA — Richard Goldstone, a South African jurist, led a 15-member team into Gaza on Monday for a one-week investigation of possible war crimes and human rights violations by both Israel and Hamas during Israel’s three-week assault that ended in January. The team arrived from Egypt because Israel turned down requests to cooperate. Mr. Goldstone, a former chief prosecutor for tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda as well as head of a commission of inquiry into his native South Africa, expressed disappointment at Israel’s position. Israeli officials say his mandate, from the United Nations Human Rights Council, is biased against Israel.
87 2009-06-02 The Dow Jones industrial average is the latest Wall Street institution to be reshaped by the financial crisis.

Seven years after being spun off by Citigroup, the Travelers Companies is supplanting its former parent as a member of the Dow Jones industrial average. Cisco Systems, which makes computer networking equipment, is filling the role left by General Motors, which had been a part of the Dow for 83 years. G.M. was removed after filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

Travelers will help the Dow maintain the representation of financial companies. Citigroup was expected to be removed from the index as its share price tumbled nearly 87 percent since the beginning of 2008. Shares of Travelers, a property and casualty insurer, are down about 22 percent.

Citigroup is the second financial company to be dropped from the Dow after huge losses during the credit crisis and recession. Dow Jones removed the insurer American International Group in September after it received several multibillion-dollar bailouts that gave the government a nearly 80 percent stake in the company.

As of Friday, Citigroup accounted for less than 1 percent of the value of the index, which includes 30 stocks that make up the best-known barometer of Wall Street. The Dow is down 40 percent from its record high of 14,164.53 in October 2007.
88 2009-06-02 FORT GREELY, Alaska — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates descended into an underground silo in this sub-Arctic outpost on Monday to deliver the message to North Korea — and his critics in Congress — that the United States had plenty of interceptors to shoot down an enemy missile should the North launch an attack.

“We have a good capability here,” Mr. Gates said after clambering down the stairs of the silo to view one of 16 interceptor missiles designed to stop a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile before it reaches, theoretically, San Francisco or Hawaii. “Knowing that we have this capability and that it becomes more effective each passing day should be a source of comfort to the American people in an uncertain world.”

The defense secretary, who is not normally a theatrical man, engaged in the showmanship in an attempt to soothe those in Congress who have complained that his proposed $1.2 billion worth of cuts in the missile defense budget are risky at a time when North Korea has just tested another nuclear device and continues to launch missiles.

In Mr. Gates’s proposed budget, plans for 44 interceptors here in Alaska and at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California would be reduced to 30, which Mr. Gates maintains is adequate for now.

“It’s not a forever decision,” Mr. Gates said. “And if capabilities in one of these rogue states should develop faster, or in a more worrisome way than anybody anticipates right now, then I think the way is open in the future to add to the number of silos and interceptors up here.”
89 2009-06-02 The disappearance of an jet en route from to on Sunday evening left seasoned crash investigators with a mystery to plumb and very little data to work with.

The Airbus A330-200, carrying 228 passengers and crew members, is believed to have vanished in a towering thunderstorm with no word from its pilots that they were in crisis.

The plane had beamed out several signals that its electrical systems had malfunctioned and, according to one report, that it had lost cabin pressure. The signals were sent not as distress calls, however, but as automated reports to Air France’s maintenance system, and were not read for hours, until air traffic controllers realized that the plane’s crew had not radioed in on schedule.

As a search for wreckage began over a vast swath of ocean between and the African coast, experts struggled to offer plausible theories as to how a well-maintained modern jetliner, built to withstand electrical and physical buffeting far greater than nature usually offers, could have gone down so silently and mysteriously.

There were no suggestions on Monday that a bomb, a hijacking or sabotage was to blame. Whatever of the plane’s final minutes was recorded in its black box may never be known, because it is presumably at the bottom of the Atlantic. As is common with trans-ocean flights, it was too far out over the sea to be tracked on land-based radar from Brazil or . Whether its location was captured by satellite or other planes’ radar is not known yet.

The plane, Flight AF 447, was scheduled to arrive at airport at 11:10 a.m. local time. Stricken relatives descended on Terminal 2D, where the airline established a crisis center. A black-robed priest was making his way past hordes of police officers and journalists to comfort relatives of those on the flight.

“Air France is extremely distraught, and the whole team of Air France is suffering,” Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the chief executive of Air France-KLM, told reporters in Paris. “We would like to say to the relatives of the victims that we are totally with them and will make every effort to help them.”

President of said: “It’s a tragic accident. The chances of finding survivors are tiny.”

There were people of 32 nationalities aboard, including 58 Brazilians, 61 French and 2 Americans, Air France said in a statement based on information from Brazilian authorities.

The flight took off from Rio de Janeiro at 7:30 p.m. local time (6:30 p.m. Eastern time), and its last verbal communication with air traffic control was three hours later, at 10:33, according to a statement from Brazil’s civil aviation agency. At that time, the flight was at 35,000 feet and traveling at 520 miles per hour.

About a half-hour later, it apparently encountered an electrical storm with “very heavy turbulence,” Air France said. The last communication from it came at 11:14 — a series of automatic messages indicating it had suffered an electrical-system malfunction. The Associated Press reported that it also suffered a loss of cabin pressure.

Brazilian officials said the plane disappeared over the Atlantic somewhere between a point 186 miles northeast of their coastal city and the islands off . The area is known as the intertropical convergence zone, where the tropics of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres mix, sometimes creating violent and unpredictable thunderstorms that can rise to 55,000 feet, higher than commercial jetliners can go.

Experts were at a loss to explain fatal damage from lightning or a tropical storm, both of which jetliners face routinely, despite efforts to avoid them — as much out of concern for passengers’ nerves as for the planes’ safety.

Pilots are trained to go over or around thunderstorms rather than through them. Brigitte Barrand, an Air France spokeswoman, said the highly experienced pilot had clocked 11,000 flying hours, including 1,100 hours on Airbus 330 jets.

“Lightning alone is not enough to explain the loss of this plane,” Julien Gourguechon, a longtime Air France pilot, said. “Turbulence alone is not enough.”

“It is always a combination of factors,” Mr. Gourgeon said. By some estimates, jetliners are typically hit by lightning at least once a year. But the strike normally travels across the plane’s aluminum skin and out the tail or a wingtip. Passengers are insulated in the nonconductive, largely plastic interior, and vital equipment is shielded.

A loss of cabin pressure could suggest a break in the fuselage, but planes are built to withstand buffeting from a storm’s updrafts and downdrafts. It could also be a consequence of an electrical failure, if the plane’s air compressors stop working.

Large hailstones created by some thunderstorms have been known to break windshields or turbine blades, though pilots would be likely to rapidly report something like that.

The missing aircraft was relatively new, having gone into service in April 2005. Its last hangar maintenance check was on April 16, Air France said. No A330-200 passenger flight ever had a fatal crash, according to the Aviation Safety Network.

Hans Weber, head of the Tecop aviation consulting firm in , offered a hypothesis about the episode, based on his knowledge of severe losses of altitude by two Qantas jets last year.

The new Airbus 330 was a “fly-by-wire” plane, in which signals to move the aileron, rudder and elevators are sent through electric wires to small motors rather than through cables or hydraulic tubing. Fly-by-wire systems can automatically conduct maneuvers to prevent an impending crash, but some Airbus jets will not allow a pilot to override the self-protection mechanism.

On both Qantas flights, the planes’ inertia sensors sent faulty information into the flight computers, making them take emergency measures to correct problems that did not exist, sending the planes into sudden dives.

If the inertia sensor told a computer that a plane was stalling, forcing it to drop the nose and dive to pick up airspeed, and there was simultaneously a severe downdraft in the storm turbulence, “that would be hard to recover from,” Mr. Weber said.

108 2009-06-03 The commissioner in charge of New York City’s jails and its probation department said Tuesday night that he would announce his resignation on Wednesday.

The commissioner, Martin F. Horn, said he would not answer questions about why he was stepping down until after the announcement, because “I think that would be unfair to the mayor.”

But a senior adviser to the mayor said that Mr. Horn planned to take a teaching job.

Mr. Horn’s departure comes in the wake of a swine flu outbreak in the jails on Rikers Island. Officials have been testing inmates since one of them was hospitalized with the H1N1 virus on May 15. (On Monday, a city official said there had been 47 confirmed cases there.)

The commissioner is also leaving a month after a suspect in an attempted burglary died while being held at Rikers.

The resignation is the latest high-level departure from the Bloomberg administration, which prides itself on low turnover.
109 2009-06-03 A new appraisal of existing studies documenting the links between tiny soot particles and premature death from cardiovascular ailments shows that mortality rates among people exposed to the particles are twice as high as previously thought.

Dan Greenbaum, the president of the nonprofit Health Effects Institute, which is releasing the analysis on Wednesday, said that the areas covered in the study included 116 American cities, with the highest levels of soot particles found in areas including the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles and the Central Valley of California; Birmingham, Ala.; Atlanta; the Ohio River Valley; and Pittsburgh.

The review found that the risk of having a condition that is a precursor to deadly heart attacks for people living in soot-laden areas goes up by 24 percent rather than 12 percent, as particle concentrations increase.

A variety of sources produce fine particles, and they include diesel engines, automobile tires, coal-fired power plants and oil refineries.

Comparing exposure within the New York and the Los Angeles metropolitan areas, the study found that the risks were evenly distributed in the vicinity of New York while some areas around Los Angeles, including neighborhoods near the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, had elevated health risks.

The extended epidemiological analysis, which draws on data gathered from 350,000 people over 18 years, and an additional 150,000 people in more recent years, was conducted for the Health Effects Institute by scientists at the University of Ottawa.
110 2009-06-03 The Obama administration, juggling an array of huge and pressing issues on the economy and health care reform, has encouraged the mobilization of immigration advocates, especially Latino groups, while avoiding any legislative battles for now on the prickly topic of immigration. President Obama has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White House next Monday to “launch a policy conversation” about immigration, an administration official said.

The president wants to “identify areas of agreement, and areas where we still have work to do,” said the official, who would only speak on background because the final plans for the meeting were not settled.

The most contentious part of the immigration legislation that the administration supports, which is known as comprehensive immigration reform, is a program to give legal status to more than 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country. But current proposals also include a variety of measures intended, like Senator Leahy’s, to expand or streamline the legal immigration system.

Mr. Leahy’s proposal for same-sex immigration benefits was not included in the immigration legislation that the Bush administration brought forward in 2007, which failed after a firestorm of opposition, mainly from Republican voters.

Groups backing the overhaul this year have cobbled together a wide-ranging but fragile coalition that includes Latino and black groups, Roman Catholic and evangelical Christian churches, farm workers and commercial farmers, and some employer groups. In contrast to 2007, organized labor is united this time around in supporting the overhaul.

The political fault lines opened by Senator Leahy’s same-sex bill quickly became apparent this week. In a letter sent Tuesday, Bishop John C. Wester of Salt Lake City, the chairman of the Catholic bishops’ Committee on Migration, wrote that the Uniting American Families Act would “erode the institution of marriage and family,” by taking a position “that is contrary to the very nature of marriage which pre-dates the Church and the State.”

Bishop Wester addressed his letter to Representative Michael M. Honda, a California Democrat who has said he will introduce an immigration bill containing similar same-sex provisions in the House this week.

J. Kevin Appleby, the immigration policy director for the bishops’ conference, said, “The last thing the national immigration debate needs is another politically divisive issue added to the mix.”

But Senator Leahy said the bill would eliminate discrimination in immigration law against gay and lesbian couples.

Under family unification provisions in immigration law, American citizens and legal residents can petition for residency for their spouses. There is no numerical limit on permanent residence visas, known as green cards, for spouses of American citizens, and this is one of the main channels for legal immigration to the United States. Same-sex couples, though, cannot petition for partners, and many face the prospect of an immigrant partner’s deportation.

Senator Leahy’s bill would add the term “permanent partner” to sections of current immigration law that refer to married couples, and would provide a legal definition of those terms.

“I just think it’s a matter of fairness,” he said Tuesday in an interview, noting that a number of American allies, including Canada, France and Germany, recognize same-sex couples in immigration law.

The Judiciary Committee is to hear testimony on Wednesday from Shirley Tan, 43, the mother of twin 12-year-old boys who are United States citizens because they were born here. Ms. Tan has raised them with her partner of 20 years, Jay Mercado, who like Ms. Tan is from the Philippines. Although Ms. Mercado became a naturalized American citizen in 1998, she has not been able to gain legal immigration status for Ms. Tan.

Ms. Tan said she came to this country fleeing a cousin who was released from prison in the Philippines after he served 10 years for the murders of her mother and her sister. Ms. Tan said she had been severely injured in the 1979 attack by the cousin.

She applied for political asylum in the United States, she said, but did not receive notice when it was denied years later. She remained here with a provisional legal status until last Jan. 28, when federal immigration agents carrying a deportation order came to the home she shares with Ms. Mercado, 48, in Pacifica, Calif.

Since her arrest, Ms. Tan has been able to remain legally in the country because of a private bill introduced on her behalf by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.

Ms. Tan said she feared returning to live in the Philippines, in part because of concern that she and Ms. Mercado would face anti-gay discrimination there.

“People are cruel,” she said. “I don’t know if I can expose my boys to narrow-minded people.”

Opponents of the Leahy bill argue that it would foster immigration fraud because it would be difficult for immigration officers to determine whether same-sex couples had an established relationship.

Supporters said the bill would assist about 36,000 same-sex couples nationwide. Rachel B. Tiven, the executive director of Immigration Equality, a group that advocates for gay rights legislation, said the bill had improved chances this year because of recent same-sex marriage victories in Iowa, Maine and Vermont.
111 2009-06-03 The World Health Organization said Tuesday that it was moving closer to declaring swine flu a worldwide pandemic.

The disease has reached 64 countries, and there have been dozens or hundreds of cases in several nations outside North America, including Britain, Spain, Japan, Chile and Australia.

The Southern Hemisphere countries are now of chief interest because their winter flu season is just beginning and another strain of the H1N1 virus, widespread last winter, was resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu.

To raise the flu alert to its highest level, Level 6, the W.H.O. would need to find evidence of widespread “community transmission” — meaning beyond travelers, schools and immediate contacts — on two continents. Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency’s chief of flu, said that finding had not been made.

The agency is debating new rules for assessing global disease outbreaks. If it declares a Level 6 pandemic, Dr. Fukuda said, it may add a caveat indicating that the virus is not very lethal. The flu has been blamed for only 117 deaths.
112 2009-06-03 James J. Pallotta, a stock picker and former partner of the hedge fund pioneer Paul Tudor Jones, has decided to liquidate his $800 million Raptor Global fund after losses and investor withdrawals last year, he said in a letter sent to investors on Tuesday.

Mr. Pallotta, a co-owner of the Boston Celtics, did not give a specific reason for closing the fund, but wrote in the letter that he had grown skeptical of the “sustainability of certain aspects of the industry’s structure and short-term focus.”

At its peak in mid-2007, Raptor managed nearly $9 billion in assets, but that declined to about $5 billion last August. Like other hedge funds, Raptor took huge losses in the fourth quarter and had a wave of withdrawal requests.

A person familiar with Mr. Pallotta’s thinking said he planned to take a few months off before raising money for a new fund, most likely with a focus on longer-term investments. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement signed with the fund.

A spokesman for Mr. Pallotta declined to comment on his decision.

The move is surprising because Mr. Pallotta ended a 15-year partnership with Mr. Tudor Jones on Jan. 1 to form his own firm. As part of the separation agreement, Raptor, which was formed in 1993, was spun out of Tudor Investment Corporation as an independent business, and Mr. Pallotta took several veteran traders and portfolio managers with him.
113 2009-06-03 The Obama administration and some large banks and insurance companies have been pushing for the creation of a single federal watchdog to oversee the financial industry.

In many ways, that seems reasonable. Such an entity could minimize regulatory venue shopping, monitor systemic risks and find a way to wind down troubled institutions. But having a whole pack of watchdogs on the prowl might be a better way to keep Wall Street honest.

Two senior members of Congress, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, have expressed worries that a super-regulator would put too many eggs in one basket. They’ve got a point: if this agency misses a problem, it could grow and become unmanageable. And giving more power to, say, the Federal Reserve could create an unwieldy and potentially overwhelmed institution. But their concern presents a nagging question: What are the alternatives?

Adding to the number of regulators patrolling Wall Street seems like the last thing the industry needs. After all, the banks’ ability to exploit the current hodgepodge of regulatory authorities by seeking out its weakest links allowed them to plunge into unwise and risky strategies that the watchdogs did not block or fully understand. The American International Group, for example, expanded its risky derivatives operation within the regulatory arms of the hapless Office of Thrift Supervision, whose original mandate was to oversee community lenders.

And there is already plenty of room for venue shopping. Oversight is fractured among entities like the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees commercial banks; the Federal Reserve, which also has a role overseeing money-center banks; the Securities and Exchange Commission, which keeps an eye on the securities industry; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which swoops in on troubled institutions.

Unfortunately, as Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. proved, this patchwork has many holes. One gaping problem is that the banks’ multitrillion-dollar off-exchange derivatives business, a potential vector of financial contagion, largely escapes regulation. Proponents of centralizing bank oversight say it would help bring more of these products under government scrutiny by eliminating turf wars among various agencies.
114 2009-06-03 After months of complaints by university groups and scientific organizations, the State Department is acting to speed up the delay-plagued visa process for foreign graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, an official said Tuesday.

The official, David Donahue, the deputy assistant secretary of state for consular services, said the department started attacking the backlog of requests on Friday. “I am not sure when we will get all of them cleared up,” he said, but eventually routine requests should be dealt with in two weeks. He said the department had brought in extra staff to handle the applications and had revised procedures to speed reviews.

Albert H. Teich, the director of science and policy programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science called the moves “very gratifying.” Dr. Teich said he and representatives of the National Academy of Sciences, the Association of American Universities and other groups learned of the changes in a conference call last week.

Since last year, science and engineering researchers from abroad seeking to obtain or renew visas have routinely encountered delays of months. The problem became so acute that researchers who left the country often found themselves stranded abroad, not knowing when their visas might be approved.

The delays have caused problems for American universities, which rely on foreigners to fill slots in graduate and post-doctoral science and engineering programs. Foreign talent also fuels scientific and technical innovation in American laboratories, and the visa difficulties discouraged scientific organizations from holding meetings in the United States. Some researchers said the apparent reluctance of the United States to accept them encouraged them to seek work in other countries.

Mr. Donahue said the clearance process was important, especially as it related to “guarding against proliferation of science and technical information.” But he said people in the department were unhappy about the delays. “We should not have been behind, but we will be glad to be caught up,” he said.
115 2009-06-03 Barclays stock fell 42.75 pence (70 cents), or 13.52 percent, to close at 273.5 pence ($4.50) in London, reflecting an increase of more than 15 percent in the number of Barclays shares in the market, to about 9.7 billion. Barclays shares are still up nearly 80 percent this year, while the FTSE global banks index is up nearly 12 percent.

Many governments and investors that provided aid to shore up banks after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September are now thinking of extricating themselves from their investments. The Barclays divestment appeared to make Abu Dhabi one of the first big sovereign wealth funds to do so at a profit.

Temasek Holdings, a fund owned by the Singapore Ministry of Finance, is thought to have lost at least $3 billion on its stake in Bank of America, which it sold in the first quarter. The Swiss government is considering an exit from its investment in UBS, which it provided with 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.6 billion) in October.

Institutional investors and Qatari funds are also holding billions of pounds’ worth of mandatory convertible notes in Barclays, which will convert to common shares at the end of June at 153 pence ($2.52) each. That means there will be about 11 billion shares on the market, counting the Abu Dhabi stake. But the investors are under no obligation to sell.

The investment company, which is run by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, said it was selling its stake before the mandatory June conversion date to focus on its core oil and natural gas business.

In a statement, Khadem al-Qubaisi, managing director of the Abu Dhabi fund, expressed “great confidence” in Barclays. “The Emirate of Abu Dhabi intends to maintain a close commercial and strategic relationship with Barclays in the future,” he said.

“I don’t think it’s a reflection on Barclays,” Mr. Wheeldon said of the decision by Abu Dhabi to sell. “Rather, I think it’s a reflection on Abu Dhabi’s view of the market, which has probably run up faster than anticipated, so maybe it’s time to pause to catch up.”

Barclays, which operates in more than 50 countries and employs 156,000 people, has sought to expand during the financial crisis, acquiring Lehman Brothers’ operations in the United States and adding to its staff in Europe and Asia. Analysts said the Abu Dhabi sale was unlikely to affect the bank’s plans.
116 2009-06-03 Arthur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will advise the Goldman Sachs Group on public policy issues, the firm announced Tuesday.

Mr. Levitt, also a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, will offer “strategic advice to the firm on a range of matters,” Goldman Sachs said in a statement. Mr. Levitt, 78, left the S.E.C. in February 2001 as its longest-serving chairman.

Federal regulators and lawmakers are overhauling the rules governing financial institutions after firms reported more than $1.48 trillion of write-downs and credit losses since 2007.

Mr. Levitt, a graduate of Williams College, served as chairman of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and as chairman of the American Stock Exchange. Before working for the S.E.C., he owned Roll Call, a Washington newspaper that covers government and legislative issues. He is also a member of the board of Bloomberg, the parent of Bloomberg News.
117 2009-06-03 “Value means different things to different people,” said Herb Walter, consumer packaged-goods and retail advisory partner at the Washington office of PricewaterhouseCoopers. “You almost have to think about it in the plural instead of the singular.”

One type of consumer behavior that is becoming more prevalent, Mr. Walter said, is “paying closer attention to the spread of price points in a category — premium, midprice, lower — and more selectively choosing a price point.”

“If it’s Johnny’s birthday and you’ve got the relatives coming, you may splurge a bit” on food and beverage brands, he added, “but if you’re buying midweek for the family, you may buy a more value-oriented product.”

PricewaterhouseCoopers, along with the Grocery Manufacturers Association, plan to issue a report on Wednesday on the financial performance of marketers of consumer packaged goods. The report concludes that the industry is weathering the recession better than others because of a focus on delivering value along with innovation.

Value “is not just about price,” said Clayton Wai-Poi, senior brand manager for Kraft Singles cheese slices at Kraft Foods in Northfield, Ill.

As a result, “the role Kraft Singles can play in meeting mom’s needs in the current climate” extends beyond ads that describe how a meal of a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of Campbell’s tomato soup can “warm hearts without stretching budgets,” Mr. Wai-Poi said.

There are also promotions sponsored by Kraft Singles with partners like the Walt Disney Company and Minor League Baseball, he added, that are centered on affordable family entertainment.

And at Procter & Gamble, a line featuring new products that cost $42 to $62 each — a far cry from the price of a bar of Ivory soap — is getting a value designation because, ads assert, it performs like product lines costing much more.

The line is called Olay Professional Pro-X, part of the Olay skin-care brand. A print campaign from Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, that is scheduled to begin in July for the Intensive Wrinkle Protocol — a regimen kit of three products — will carry this headline: “As effective at wrinkle reduction as what the doctor prescribed. At half the price.”

The Pro-X items cost two or three times as much as the products in another Olay line, Total Effects, which cost about $20 to $25 apiece.

“It is getting into higher price points,” said Tim Bunch, Olay Pro-X brand manager at Procter in Cincinnati. So “if you’re going to lay down that type of money,” he added, “it ought to be for a brand you believe in.”

“With Olay, we’ve built that trust with women through the decades,” Mr. Bunch said. “A big element of value is standing behind your product, especially in beauty where so much is smoke and mirrors.”

Since the line was introduced in January, “consumers have really responded,” he added, to the point where Procter executives now “project Olay Professional will be the largest skin-care launch in North America in year-one dollar sales.”

Helping achieve those results, Mr. Bunch said, is an image for the Olay brand as one that “speaks straightforward and direct to consumers.”

“We tell them what we believe the truth is,” he added, which includes an acknowledgment that not all women will achieve the same results after using Olay products.

“If you don’t see it for yourself, I would rather you find a product better suited to your needs,” Mr. Bunch said, and return the Olay items for a refund.

Hmmmm. That calls to mind the scene from the classic movie “Miracle on 34th Street” when the Santa Claus at Macy’s (Edmund Gwenn) informs a skeptical shopper (Thelma Ritter) that the fire engine she wants to buy her son, which Macy’s does not have, can be found at another store.

“The only important thing is to make the children happy,” Mr. Gwenn says. “Who sells the toy doesn’t make any difference. Don’t you feel that way?”

Ms. Ritter replies: “Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure. Only I didn’t know Macy’s did.”
118 2009-06-03 Teenagers whose parents have a history of depression are at particularly high risk of becoming depressed themselves. Now, a large clinical trial has found that a group cognitive behavioral program that teaches coping and problem-solving skills to such high-risk teenagers can reduce the risk.

But, the study also found, the success rate of the prevention program varied greatly depending on the mental health status of the teenagers’ parents at the time they began intervention. The program was much more effective than standard care if the parents were also not depressed when the intervention began.

The study was published in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association.

“Were we surprised?” said Judy Garber, a professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University. “No. There is evidence in the literature that kids don’t respond as well to treatment if the parent is depressed.”

John R. Weisz, a professor of psychology at Harvard University and president and C.E.O. of Judge Baker Children's Center, who was not involved in the trial, said the results might help identify the best candidates for the prevention program.

He said there were several reasons why the treatment may be less effective when a parent is depressed. “It may be the biological risk for depression is greater in these adolescents — that if the parents were once depressed but aren’t depressed any longer, the biological risk isn’t as great," he said.
119 2009-06-03 Even the big boys are ramping up production. Last week DreamWorks Animation said it would increase its output by 20 percent, delivering five films every two years. Coming titles include “How to Train Your Dragon” and “Puss in Boots,” a prequel to the “Shrek” franchise.

When “Toy Story” had its debut in 1995 as the first feature-length computer-animated movie, the new look of the medium was captivating in and of itself. But this filmmaking style is becoming less special as more of it hits the big screen, movie executives say, forcing giants like Pixar and DreamWorks to keep inventing to stand out.

Few would confuse “Planet 51” with one of Pixar’s films — noted for their highly original stories and lavish production values — or a DreamWorks release, which boast A-list stars and dazzling action sequences. “Planet 51” cost about $70 million to produce, according to Ilion, compared with $160 million for the average DreamWorks title.

The independent production companies entering the market just don’t think computer-animated films need to cost that much.

“Pixar and DreamWorks films end up being very expensive because they have to invent it,” said Keith Calder, president of Snoot Entertainment, whose first animated film, “Battle for Terra,” was released in May. “What they do — breakthroughs in rendering hair and water — trickles down to us at reduced cost.”

In addition to leading the way in technology, the Walt Disney Company has inadvertently given a boost to newcomers by eliminating its Happy Meal partnership with McDonald’s as part of a children’s health initiative. So guess who has a major partnership with the fast-food chain? “Astro Boy.”

It’s easy to see what all these upstarts are chasing. In 2008 4 of the top 10 movies at the box office were computer-animated films (“Wall-E,” “Kung Fu Panda,” “Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa” and “Horton Hears a Who!”), which are easier for studios to control than their live-action counterparts.

And the medium is showing signs of expanding beyond the kiddie market. The success of video games has resulted in a generation of adults who are comfortable consuming animated entertainment, Hollywood executives say. One indication: “Coraline,” the sophisticated 3-D picture about an adventurous girl, found an adult audience, so far selling $85.2 million in tickets.

Disney will test this part of the market with “Ponyo” on Aug. 14. This Hayao Miyazaki film is centered on a 5-year-old boy’s friendship with a goldfish that wants to be human. “Sophisticated stories coupled with powerful imaginations and beautiful animation appeals to everyone,” said Kathleen Kennedy, who is co-producing the English version of the film.

Ignacio Pérez Dolset, the chief executive of Ilion, is well known in Europe for his work with video games. Mr. Dolset, via Pyro Studios, introduced its first game title, “Commandos,” in 1998. It reached No. 1 in 17 countries, selling more than 1.5 million copies. He formed Ilion in 2002 and announced “Planet 51” three years later, developing more than 100 computer applications along the way. About 400 people, based mostly in Madrid, have been toiling on the movie.

“Planet 51” tells the story of a cheery American astronaut who lands in a world filled with characters, landscapes and attitudes that bear a humorous relation to the 1950s. Joe Stillman (“Shrek” and “Shrek 2”) wrote the script; Jorge Blanco directed with Javier Abad. (The title is a nod to the secretive military base in Nevada known as Area 51.)

“The film is a recognizable world, yet one that is so unique that we see franchise opportunities everywhere,” Mr. Dolset said. “Around every corner is a new piece of business.”

George Leon, the studio’s executive vice president for worldwide consumer marketing, said, “The quality of animation is truly extraordinary, and we are blown away by the storytelling.”

Of course breaking into this market is easier said than done, something Mr. Calder knows all too well. “Battle for Terra,” distributed by Lionsgate, sold a disastrous $1.6 million in tickets — total — for its theatrical run, even though it got some positive reviews. Mr. Calder blamed the competition. “We learned it is very hard to open against an X-Men sequel,” he said.

“Igor,” the first feature from Exodus Film Group, opened last September to better results, making $29.5 million in its run, but still fell far short of a hit, although DVD sales were stronger. Exodus will try again this year with its forthcoming “Bunyan & Babe,” a computer-animated film based loosely on the Paul Bunyan folk tales.

“We learned with ‘Igor’ that a long and consistent and strong marketing campaign is a requirement for a family title,” said John D. Eraklis, chief executive of Exodus. “The nag factor is a very real thing.”
120 2009-06-03 Tuck this tidbit away somewhere: It is easier to die with your eyes open. Eyes closed  much harder.

“There’s nothing worse than sitting there holding your breath and concentrating on not moving your eyelids,” said Mike Doyle, an actor with a quick grin and a knife sticking out of his chest on the set of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” last month.

It was May 7, a day Mr. Doyle spent mostly playing dead for the season finale on Tuesday on NBC. Mr. Doyle played Ryan O’Halloran, a forensics expert who first appeared in 2003. More than 50 appearances later, revealing little about himself other than occasional impatience with his fellow officers and a drive to solve crimes, O’Halloran ran afoul of a co-worker, Dale Stuckey, who has snapped and gone on a killing rampage.

Dying on screen is nothing new for Mr. Doyle. At 36, he has been killed off in so many made-for-television movies and shows that if there were a gold statue on his mantel at home, it would be lying flat on its back with a chalk outline around it.

“This will be No. 7,” he said. “I’ve been shot with a shotgun, shot with a machine gun. I’ve been blown up in a boat. I’ve been burned in a submarine fire. I’ve been strangled and today, stabbed.”

He paused, counting on his fingers.

“Oh  and I was electrocuted on a fence. After being gang-raped.” Later, after further reflection, he realized that he had not, in fact, been shot by a machine gun, but was the one firing it. Furthermore, that particular shooting and the boat explosion happened to the same character on “Smith,” a canceled CBS show that starred Ray Liotta. For the record, Mr. Doyle’s character was shot, then the body blown up. But the total number still stands at seven, as Mr. Doyle counts a quiet death off-camera on the CBS movie “Bella Mafia.”

“They didn’t show how I died,” he said. “It’s a mystery. James Marsden meets me at a roadside stop, and the next scene, he’s wearing my clothes.”

Mr. Doyle, it should be noted, has survived several roles as well, most recently on HBO’s therapy drama “In Treatment,” in which he had a brief cameo as Bennett Ryan, the boss and lover of the character Mia, played by Hope Davis. Later in the season she described in graphic detail his shortcomings in the bedroom, but she doesn’t kill him. He also had small roles in the films “Rules of Attraction” and “P.S. I Love You,” and has a supporting role in the forthcoming film “Rabbit Hole.”

After a small role in the “ABC Afterschool Specials,” his first big acting job also included his first death on screen. “It was a movie-of-the-week called ‘Loss of Innocence,’ ” he said, a 1996 drama set in 1920s Utah about a Mormon community. Mr. Doyle’s character goes hunting with his brother, who happens to be having an affair with his wife. There is an “accident,” and then there is one fewer brother.

In 1997 Mr. Doyle had the bit part in “Bella Mafia.” In 2002 he appeared in a four-episode arc on the HBO prison drama “Oz” that was particularly grim even by that show’s standards. He played Adam Guenzel, a rich kid convicted of rape who is in turn transformed into a lipstick-wearing sex slave behind bars. It was on this HBO show that he met Christopher Meloni, who also played a prisoner and went on to star in “Special Victims Unit.”

“I took one look at that face,” Mr. Meloni recalled in his dressing room, “and said, ‘Bye-bye.’ Pretty boys don’t last long on ‘Oz.’ ” Mr. Doyle’s character was raped by Aryans, then killed in an attempt to escape, last seen hanging  eyes open  over the top of a prison fence.

“It looked so cool,” Mr. Doyle said. “The makeup was phenomenal.”

Next he will be strangled in a flashback scene of a horror movie called “Sibling: Marcus Miller the Orphan Killer.” We take him at his word for this as the film has not been released.

The role of O’Halloran on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” was Mr. Doyle’s longest job. Only a couple of weeks before filming, he learned of his character’s demise from Neal Baer, a producer, in a telephone call to his apartment in the East Village, where he has lived most of the last 12 years.

Mr. Meloni, his old co-star from “Oz,” searched for a bright side: “He said, ‘At least you’re not getting gang-raped,’ ” Mr. Doyle said.

The staging of the death was fairly elaborate. Strapped to Mr. Doyle’s chest was a metal plate with a center slot holding the retractable blade of a fake knife. He walked onto the set in a warehouse in North Bergen, N.J., on May 7, and somebody shouted, “Dead man walking!”

He lay on his designated spot on the floor of the crime lab, and no fewer than 18 people hovered over him, dabbing fake blood on his shirt and hands and angling the knife just so. “Mike, bring your left leg in that way,” said George Pattison, a camera operator. “Go for comfort. You know that.”

Between takes, his co-stars shared their own past death scenes. The actor Noel Fisher, who plays Stuckey the killer, recalled his suicide scene on “Huff,” in which he shot himself in the mouth, and fake blood and cottage cheese blasted out of the back of his head. Mr. Meloni was hanged in one movie and made a deadly swan dive in “Oz.”

There is one person who will never get used to seeing Mr. Doyle die on screen, no matter how many times it happens: his mother, who picks up the phone in Northern California every time.

“She’ll call me and say, ‘I know it’s not real, but I just want to make sure you’re O.K.,’ ” he said. “Not that many mothers have seen their son die over and over.”
121 2009-06-03 It was the first game of the College Softball World Series finals, but Jenn Salling got a Little League grand slam when her two-out single brought in four runs in Washington’s 8-0 victory over Florida on Monday night in Game 1 of the best-of-three series. Game 2 is Tuesday night.

In the college baseball playoffs, the N.C.A.A. super regional times and places are set, and USA Today breaks down the matchups. Texas will host Texas Christian in a best-of-three series in Austin, Tex., beginning Saturday. That should give Texas’ closer, Austin Wood, some much-needed rest. He’s the pitcher who was called on in the seventh inning in a 2-2 tie against Boston College over the weekend and wound up working 13 innings, including 12 1/ 3 without allowing a hit, before the Longhorns won, 3-2, in 25 innings, the longest game in N.C.A.A. history. Wood threw 169 pitches, struck out 14 and gave up 2 hits.

In the N.B.A., writers are still talking about the non-handshake. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports writes that Cleveland’s biggest problem is that nobody has the guts to tell LeBron James that he sounds like an immature, self-absorbed brat. And in The Detroit Free Press, the columnist Drew Sharp gets the rare twofer. He writes that James and Sidney Crosby are two of a kind, caught in the media’s glare. And he offered the N.H.L. an interesting P.R. strategy: “The N.H.L. should tell Crosby to follow James’s lead and not shake the Wings’ hands once the Penguins have lost the Stanley Cup for the second straight year.” No charge for that advice, either.

Keeping his focus on the teams that are still hoping to win a championship this year, John Hillinger of ESPN.com writes that the past meetings between the Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando favor the Magic.

Switching to the N.F.L, how is Eric Mangini doing in his first five months with the Cleveland Browns? Has he brought new intensity to the organization and a culture change to the Browns, or did he also bring “a sophisticated form of hazing” rookies? On Friday The Cleveland Plain Dealer, citing multiple N.F.L. sources, reported that the Browns rookies and their agents were baffled because Mangini took the rookies on a 10-hour bus trip to Hartford to work a football camp for children in grades 8 to 12. The Browns say the camp was voluntary, but the players feel that often voluntary can mean mandatory.

In golf, Phil Mickelson, whose wife, Amy, is being treated for breast cancer, has decided to return to the tour at the St. Jude Classic in Memphis on June 11, according to Golf World.

146 2009-06-04 As a conservative former Texas Supreme Court justice, Mr. Cornyn might be expected to make a tough intellectual case against Judge Sotomayor. But as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he also has to worry about how the confirmation battle plays across the nation. And his own future back home is tied somewhat to Hispanics who will be closely watching the confirmation proceedings.

Elected to a second term last fall in a difficult year for his party, Mr. Cornyn said he saw no conflict among his ideological leanings, his responsibility for boosting Republican Senate candidates and his own home-state interests.

He also said he would press to define the contours of Judge Sotomayor’s legal philosophy and remind Americans that Democrats were not alone in trying to put a Hispanic jurist in line for the Supreme Court.

“I will bet there are a lot of people who don’t really remember Miguel Estrada,” Mr. Cornyn said, referring to the Honduran-born federal appeals court nominee put forward by President George W. Bush. Mr. Estrada was considered likely to be a future Supreme Court nominee before his nomination to the appeals court was blocked by a Democratic filibuster in 2003.

An imposing 6 feet 4 inches tall, Mr. Cornyn manages to combine congeniality with combativeness. He often takes to the Senate floor to joust with Democrats, though in a lawyerly way befitting his experience as a judge and an attorney general.

But he did not hold back against those in his own party who made what he saw as harmful and overly personal criticism of Judge Sotomayor in the first few days after her selection.

Attention quickly focused on a 2001 speech in which Judge Sotomayor suggested that a Latina judge might have better judgment than a white male judge. Mr. Gingrich, among other critics, asserted that the remark showed her to be racist.

“I just think that was the wrong way to start the discussion,” Mr. Cornyn said.

His words evidently carried some weight. As Judge Sotomayor made a second day of rounds in the Senate on Wednesday, Mr. Gingrich dialed back his accusation, writing on his Web site that “the word ‘racist’ should not have been applied to Judge Sotomayor as a person, even if her words themselves are unacceptable.”

“I think it speaks well of Newt,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who met with Judge Sotomayor and said he did not believe she was racist. “There is no evidence of that.”

But in a sign that Republicans will not easily fall in line on the nomination, Mr. Graham said he remained troubled by her comments and painted himself as a likely vote against her.

As Democrats push for confirmation hearings next month, they see Mr. Cornyn and his fellow Republicans struggling with a delicate political balance, wanting to put tough scrutiny on Judge Sotomayor without alienating Hispanics.

“He is in a difficult situation, and he is trying to figure it out,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who said Mr. Cornyn sometimes picked his brain in the Senate gym.

Despite his conservative credentials, Mr. Cornyn finds himself at odds with some on the right over more than just the tone of the nomination fight. He is also under fire for the way he is carrying out his responsibilities as chairman of the Senate Republican campaign operation.

His decision to back Gov. Charlie Crist over a more conservative Republican for the Senate nomination in Florida and his courting of party moderates like Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware for a Senate run there have drawn scorn from some conservatives, who accuse him of watering down the brand.

Mr. Cornyn makes no apologies, saying he bases political decisions on a simple premise: “I want to win, and I don’t think the Republican Party wins becoming more and more insular.”

Mr. Cornyn argues that Republicans desperately need to become more inclusive, a factor that drove him to challenge the attacks on Judge Sotomayor and helps govern his view of the nomination. He said that he was all for a close examination of the nominee, but that scrutiny must focus on her judicial philosophy, qualifications and record, not her ethnicity or sex.

“She certainly has a distinguished career,” Mr. Cornyn said. “The real question is how she views her role as a judge: whether it is to advance causes or groups or whether it is to call balls and strikes.”
147 2009-06-04 A congressman has written a letter to the National Basketball Association and the players union asking them to repeal the rule governing the minimum age of players.

Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, wrote that the four-year-old rule, which requires that players be 19 years old and one year removed from their high school graduation, is of “deep concern.”

“It’s a vestige of slavery,” Cohen said Wednesday in a phone interview, noting that most of the players affected by the rule are African-American. “Not like the slavery of 150 years ago, but it’s a restraint on a person’s freedoms and liberties.”

Cohen said he was dismayed to hear that N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern was hoping to extend the age limit to 20. He added that his office was in the process of looking into the legalities of the limit and that a hearing and legislation were possible. He said the issue would fall under the jurisdiction of the House’s Judiciary Committee.

“Hopefully, they’ll just do the right thing,” he said.

Cohen said that one of his primary arguments against the rule, which is part of the collective bargaining agreement between the league and union, was that soldiers can fight for their country at age 18 but not play in the N.B.A. He also said noted that predominantly white sports like hockey, baseball and golf lack similar restrictions.

“There’s something wrong with keeping kids, who are more likely to be African-American than not, from playing professional basketball and football when they can help their families and communities immediately,” Cohen said. “They’re forced to go to school when they have no desire or interest in going to school.”

The N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass said the league was looking forward to receiving and responding to the congressman’s letter. The players union spokesman Dan Wasserman said he expected the age issue to be “front and center” when the collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2011, is renegotiated. Wasserman added that the union looked forward to the opportunity to “revisit the change to the rule that was made in 2005.”

Cohen said he began researching the issue in April and chose to write the letter now to use the spotlight of the N.B.A. finals for exposure. Four of the biggest stars in the finals  Kobe Bryant, Andrew Bynum, Dwight Howard and Rashard Lewis skipped college before the rule changed. (The current rule essentially forces players to attend college for a year.)

“I don’t think its fair,” Lewis said, ticking off the names of the players in the finals. He added: “The M.V.P. of the league, LeBron James, came out of high school. Kevin Garnett won a championship last year. There are a handful of guys who are the face of the game who came out of high school. So I think you should continue to let certain guys do it, make that jump.”

Part of the reason that Cohen has raised the issue is that the University of Memphis, which is in his district, has had, in Derrick Rose and Tyreke Evans, so-called one-and-done players in each of the last two years. Rose and Evans, each played one season before declaring his intention to turn pro.

“I think the odds of either of them coming back and getting a degree is probably less likely than the Grizzlies winning the N.B.A. title next year,” Cohen said, referring to Memphis’s hapless N.B.A. franchise.

Memphis is currently in the throes of a scandal in which the N.C.A.A. is alleging that a Memphis player, presumed to be Rose, had a standardized test taken for him.

Cohen said that the controversy and the allegations that the former Southern California star O. J. Mayo took money and gifts illegally while in college would not have happened if this rule was not in place.

He added that the former Georgia Tech star Thaddeus Young, who is from his district, was also affected by the rule.

“He could have gone straight to the pros,” Cohen said. “I don’t think he’s going to be an engineer. It’s just kind of a mockery.”
148 2009-06-04 They also argued that Congress had acted unconstitutionally, essentially taking over a role reserved for the courts in deciding the legal liability of the phone companies over accusations that they had violated the privacy rights of their customers.

After a fight lasting months, Congress last July included the immunity provision for the phone companies as part of a broader overhaul of federal wiretapping law. The debate put , then a Democratic senator from , in an awkward political position, as he initially opposed the provision and vowed to it on the Senate floor, only to anger some of his supporters by voting for it.

Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department has maintained the Bush administration’s forceful efforts to kill the lawsuits, and the department said Wednesday that it was pleased by the ruling.

“Judge ruling today was the appropriate result based on the law,” said Tracy Schmaler, a spokeswoman. “The law is clear. The department sought and obtained this dismissal based on the law, and the department’s role is to defend the statute.”

Since Congress acted 11 months ago, Judge Walker considered more arguments and numerous filings on whether Congress could pass immunity retroactively and whether it had acted improperly in sidelining the judiciary and allowing the executive branch to “certify” that the phone companies had met the conditions for immunity.

In his ruling on Wednesday, Judge Walker said the legal protection carved out by Congress for the phone companies appeared unique in immunity law. “It creates a retroactive immunity for past, completed acts committed by private parties acting in concert with government entities that allegedly violated constitutional rights,” he wrote.

But he said the objections of the privacy groups were not strong enough to override the wishes of Congress.

The ruling disappointed the groups suing the phone companies, in part because Judge Walker had shown some sympathy for the plaintiffs’ claims. He had refused the government’s efforts to invoke the “state secrets” privilege and had moved toward compelling the Justice Department to turn over documents.

“I’m very surprised,” said Bruce I. Afran, a lawyer in representing a group of phone users. “It looks like a complete reversal of the positions that he took earlier. Judge Walker’s decision lets the government be the judge of its own actions, and that’s a pretty dangerous precedent.”

Cindy Cohn, legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said one “silver lining” was that Judge Walker had kept intact related claims against the government over the wiretapping program, as well as a suit by an charity that says it has evidence it was a target of wiretapping without warrants.

The phone companies have said almost nothing publicly about the lawsuits, refusing even to acknowledge whether they had assisted in the wiretapping program. But on Wednesday AT&T and — the biggest defendants — did express satisfaction.

“We are gratified by the court’s decision,” said Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, “and we look forward to continuing our focus on serving our customers’ needs.”
149 2009-06-04 In this new era, he hoped for concrete changes like population control (he criticized the Catholic Church for not doing more in this regard) and respecting and preserving the habitats of all living things as a fundamental right.

As Dr. Berry explained in a 2006 interview with the filmmaker Caroline Webb, “From here on, the primary judgment of all human institutions, professions, programs and activities will be determined by the extent to which they inhibit, ignore or foster a mutually enhancing human-Earth relationship.”

He said the transformation of humanity’s priorities would not come easily. It would require what he called “the great work” — the title of one of his most popular books — in four realms of endeavor: the political and legal order; the economic and industrial world; education; and religion.

Colleagues and admirers say he left an imprint on fields ranging from childhood education to green architecture, not only through his writing but also through his persona.

“To spend time with him was like getting a soul transfusion,” said Mr. Louv, chairman of the Children and Nature Network, a nonprofit group whose goal is reconnecting children with nature.

William Nathan Berry, named for his father, was born on Nov. 9, 1914, in Greensboro, the third of 13 children. He often alluded to how his focus on the spiritual power of nature grew out of “numinous” experiences exploring woods and fields as a child, particularly his stumbling upon a lily-dotted meadow when he was about 11.

He later recalled the insight that shaped a lifetime of thinking: “Whatever preserves and enhances this meadow in the natural cycles of its transformation is good; what is opposed to this meadow or negates it is not good.”

When he was 20, he sought to remove himself from a world he recalled as “crassly commercial” in a 2001 profile in The National Catholic Reporter, and entered a monastery of the Passionist Order of the Catholic Church, taking the name Thomas. He was ordained in 1942, but pursued the life of a scholar, receiving a doctorate from the Catholic University of America with a dissertation on the philosophy of history.

He traveled to China in 1948 to teach at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing but, with the rise of Mao Zedong, returned to the United States a year later. He studied Chinese language and culture at Seton Hall University and Sanskrit and South Asian culture at Columbia, then served as a United States Army chaplain in Germany from 1951 to 1954.

Dr. Berry returned to teaching, first at Seton Hall and St. John’s University. From 1966 to 1979, he taught at Fordham University, where he started the doctoral program in the history of religions and where some of his students formed a devoted coterie, focused increasingly on religion and ecology. They remained involved with him for the rest of his life.

He is revered by many academicians who spent time at the Riverdale Center for Religious Research in the Bronx, which he founded in 1970 and used as an intellectual base into the 1990s. He organized a series of popular international conferences on provocative themes like “Energy: Its Cosmic-Human Dimensions.”

He wrote two books on Asian religion, “Buddhism” in 1966 and “Religions of India” in 1971. But he is best known for his later writing on the human place in the cosmos, beginning with “The Dream of the Earth” in 1988.

Other notable books are “The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Em,” which he wrote in 1992 with Brian Swimme, a mathematical cosmologist, and “The Great Work: Our Way Into the Future,” published in 1999.

Dr. Berry is survived by a sister, Margaret, of Greensboro, and three brothers: Stephen and Thomas, both of Greensboro, and Benedict, of Charlotte, N.C.

Two books of Dr. Berry’s essays are scheduled for publication in August: “The Sacred Universe” and “The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth,” said Ms. Tucker, who edited both.
150 2009-06-04 But with oil prices now above $60 a barrel, the pressure on the government of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin to change has eased, even though the stock market remains 44 percent off its high in December 2007. Instead, an economic strategy that amounts to essentially waiting out the downturn is beginning to take shape.

The interplay of change and oil prices is likely to be a major theme at an economic forum opening in St. Petersburg on Thursday, which will be attended by at least 200 emerging market investors.

“The oil price is going up, everything seems to be in order, so why change?” Sergei M. Guriev, dean of the New Economic School in Moscow and a board member of the state-owned Sberbank, said by telephone. “If oil prices go back to where there is no budget deficit, then it will be business as usual.”

State banks, for example, are rolling over loans to failing companies rather than requiring them to restructure in bankruptcy, as is the case with General Motors in the United States, on the premise that the Russian economy will quickly turn around, along with the value of oil.

“The big problem with this crisis is it may be too short for Russia,” Roland Nash, the chief strategist at Renaissance Capital, a securities firm in Moscow, said in an interview.

At first blush, oil’s rapid price rise is fabulous for Russia. For each $1 increase in the price of oil, for example, Russia’s government budget earns about $1.7 billion a year, according to Yulia Tseplayeva, the chief economist for Merrill Lynch in Moscow.

Yet in recent Russian history, the two periods of most intensive economic change — both of which were a condition for the boom of the past decade — were preceded by deep and prolonged slumps in oil prices.

In a study of the ties between oil price and policy changes in the late Soviet period, Russia’s former prime minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, says a balance-of-payment shock during the period of low oil prices in the mid-1980s was a major factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In his book “Collapse of an Empire,” Mr. Gaidar argues that the Soviet government turned to West European bank lending as the value of its principal export commodity, crude oil, plunged. That set in play the dynamic that unwound the country even before the uprisings began in the former satellite states.

The Soviets’ lack of a hard currency reserve, and thus dependence on Western lending, limited the Kremlin’s options when nationalist movements broke out. Any forceful response would surely have prompted Western banks and governments to call in their credit lines, which were propping up the Soviet government by allowing food imports.

This balance-of-payments shock also prompted the sweeping privatizations, liberalization of consumer prices and introduction of a convertible currency in the early 1990s — reforms that ultimately put the Russian economy on a modern footing.

A second sustained collapse in oil prices in the late 1990s, in the wake of the Asian economic crisis, led the government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to default on domestic debt and devalue the currency.

That shock also impelled the government to overhaul its tax regime, introducing a 13 percent flat income tax that is easier to collect and helped wean the government from domestic borrowing. In addition, that crash became the impetus for a “never again” policy that led the government to accumulate a huge currency reserve — the third largest in the world going into the current downturn, behind China and Japan.

These reforms stood Russia in good stead for the oil price collapse last autumn, cushioning the impact on the balance of payments and propping up the budget, as intended.

But the vulnerabilities of an economy that is still inadequately diversified showed themselves.

From tumultuous growth, Russia fell quite quickly into a deep recession. Its swing from 8 percent growth in 2008 to a 6.5 percent contraction this year is the most extreme of any major economy in the global slowdown.

Unemployment numbers came in higher than expected in April, at a nine-year high of 10.2 percent. As factories closed in one-industry towns, no alternative sources of employment from small and midsize business could soak up the jobless.

Also, Russian companies had borrowed excessively from Western banks, which pulled back their credit when problems arose in their home markets.

Still, the crisis did usher in some change. Until this year, government ministers or other bureaucrats dominated the boards of state-owned companies, creating a conflict of interest and risk for minority shareholders. Under a policy initiated by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, independent directors are now being appointed to these boards.

In another change that amounts to a de facto tax break for small business, Mr. Medvedev signed a law prohibiting surprise inspections from fire and health authorities of the type often used to collect bribes. Mr. Medvedev required bureaucrats to disclose not only their own income and assets, but those of their spouses as well, plugging a loophole in anticorruption legislation. A draft law prohibiting insider trading, a bane on the Russian market, is before Parliament.

Even more far-reaching measures were envisioned. The Institute for Contemporary Development, a research organization where Mr. Medvedev serves as chairman, published a report in February, back when oil prices were languishing, suggesting political liberalism would be needed to revive the economy.

Now, it is unclear how long a liberal wing will have the upper hand in the economic policy debate in the Kremlin.
151 2009-06-04 Mr. Geithner said his proposal recognized the significant role that unregulated derivatives, particularly credit-default swaps, played in the financial crisis. Such swaps, a form of insurance against the default of a bond, played a central role in the near collapse of the American International Group last year. Rather than limiting risk as they are supposed to do, the swaps wound up spreading the crisis globally.

The plan is expected to run into sharp resistance from the industry, which this week proposed its own set of voluntary rules as part of an effort to head off more aggressive legislation. Some lawmakers who applauded Mr. Geithner’s plan said they intended to press Mr. Gensler to be more aggressive in policing the marketplace even before Congress completes work on the derivatives legislation.

“Gensler has to show that the C.F.T.C. will have teeth and we can implement some things right now,” said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington. She said she had asked Mr. Gensler in recent days to revoke exemptions given to some oil futures traders through what are called no-action letters that she said could permit the manipulation of prices to consumers.

“He laments that Wall Street will be pushing back on the plan proposed by the administration and him. I told him they could get a quick gold star by revoking the no-action letters,” she said.

Some longtime critics of the absence of regulation of the derivatives markets applauded Mr. Gensler’s approach.

“I’m very enthusiastic about it,” said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School who has been critical of the lack of regulation of the market and is a former director of trading and markets at the commodities futures commission. “There has never been a proposal before to regulate the swaps dealers.”

But Frank Partnoy, another longtime critic of the lack of derivatives regulation, said the administration’s plan did not go far enough. “Disclosure to regulators will not be particularly useful,” said Mr. Partnoy, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who has written extensively about derivatives regulation. “We’ve been through decades of watching regulators chase innovation and fall progressively further behind.”

The proposal on swaps dealers would include antifraud and antimanipulation provisions as well as potential limits on market positions and holdings. It would apply regardless of whether a dealer issued standard derivatives or specially tailored ones to meet the needs of specific companies.

One major criticism of the Geithner plan was that it would permit less regulation of some of the more complicated derivatives that are custom-written, rather than plain-vanilla instruments, and would open a loophole that would keep much of the market unsupervised and opaque.

But Congressional officials said Mr. Gensler, in his testimony, would describe mechanisms to both supervise the marketplace of customized derivatives and impose standards that presume most derivatives are standard and subject to more rigorous oversight. For instance, any derivative accepted by a clearinghouse for settlement would be presumed to be a uniform derivative, not a customized one.
152 2009-06-04 Q. I personally have no reason to upgrade to Excel 2007, but I’ve started receiving files in the newer document format and have problems opening them with my older version of the program. Is there any way to open these files?

A. If you’re still running along just fine on versions of Excel from Office 2000, Office XP or Office 2003, you can update your software just enough to enable it to open Excel 2007 files.

A 28-megabyte Microsoft file called the Office Compatibility Pack lets people with older versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint open files created in Office 2007’s newer Open XML file format. The software is free at bit.ly/10IhvN, but read the overview carefully.

Microsoft recommends having certain high-priority updates installed on the computer before installing the Compatibility Pack. You can find detailed instructions for installing and using the software at support.microsoft.com/kb/924074.

People using older Mac versions of Microsoft Office can find a free Open XML converter at www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.mspx.
153 2009-06-04 No one I know actually uses more than a handful of apps on a daily basis, but these are still meaningful numbers, since the great promise of a smartphone is that it can be just about anything you need it to be in a given moment.

To offer just one example: I was at a horrible concert a few months ago, and realized I had no way to accurately convey the experience to my children. I pulled out an iPhone, paid $6 for the iRec Voice Recorder, and a few seconds later had what I needed.

In the Ovi Store, such possibilities seem greatly limited. On the phones I tested, there was no Shazam, which finds the name of a song on the radio. No Slacker, no Pandora, no Finger Paint to keep the children occupied for a few minutes and no MySpace app to quickly check for updates. (Aside from Twitter and Facebook, the only other well-known social network listed was — hold onto your hat — Friendster.)

Others seem promising, like an app that teaches you to tie knots (Handy Knots), or a 16-language Speereo Voice Translator. But the knots program was $10, and the voice translator was $30, far more expensive than comparable iPhone apps.

Ovi Store is stronger on entertainment apps and games, which have traditionally been a point of emphasis for Nokia. On many phones, you can watch episodes of Fox’s “24,” or take Lonely Planet video tours. Electronic Arts games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2009 and FIFA ’09 are available, alongside Sims games and other well-known brands.

To find them, use the search box, since browsing the Ovi Store is a slog. You can’t divide the apps by subject matter or function. Apple, meanwhile, divides its apps into 20 categories, and in each category you can sort by name, popularity or release date. In short, it’s fun to browse the App Store, whereas in the Ovi Store, it is frustrating.

Is it fair to judge Nokia by the same standard as Apple? After all, Nokia has to build a single app store that works for more than 50 phones, while Apple has one device.

Yes, Apple has a great advantage. But that means nothing to someone who is deciding whether to drop $200 on a device that can be personalized in the extreme, or spend much more on an unlocked Nokia that’s beautiful but much less versatile.

Take the 5800 Xpress Music, for one. It is available only from NokiaUSA.com or online stores like Dell.com and Amazon, or one of Nokia’s flagship stores. Like the other devices I tested, the 5800 is impressive. It has an eye-catching design, a responsive touch screen, a good camera and a dedicated key for music and videos.

Getting it working on a major carrier wouldn’t be difficult. An unlocked phone simply means it’s not tied to a wireless carrier, so you must visit AT&T or T-Mobile and get prepaid or postpaid service at which time they will give you a SIM card to activate your device. (You can’t take an unlocked Nokia to Verizon or Sprint, because they don’t support devices with SIM cards.)

But once the Xpress is up and running, the Ovi Store would have to improve — and rapidly — if it were to thwart any iPhone, Palm Pre or BlackBerry envy I would develop.

One factor suggests the Ovi Store will improve. Because Nokia enjoys such a huge lead in global market share, software developers may have more incentive to create programs for those phones than, say, the new Palm Pre.

At least one other service upgrade will make the Ovi Store a nice alternative. AT&T said it would be the first of the major American carriers to integrate its service with the Ovi Store, later this year, so purchases will appear on the monthly AT&T bill. At that point, AT&T users will also be able to download the Ovi Store to their phones, thereby remedying a huge flaw in the current service.

That’s right, current Nokia users can’t get the Ovi Store on their phones — even those who recently bought the E71x, the first subsidized Nokia smartphone in the United States — unless they bought an unlocked phone. Devices that are sold through carriers are blocked from downloading the Ovi Store software, so you must instead browse through the Ovi Store’s mobile Web page on your phone.

That’s a big deal. Unlike the downloaded version of the Ovi Store, which is optimized for your phone, the mobile Web version is much more difficult to navigate.

My advice: if you want to bet on the Ovi Store’s improving, and you absolutely fall in love with a Nokia phone, go for it. Otherwise, sit tight and see how the Ovi Store develops. Who knows — by then, carriers might even subsidize your new Nokia.

Prepaid cellphone plans are attracting new fans, but the phones that go with such plans are often yawners. Now Boost Mobile, one of the leading prepaid wireless carriers, is offering an upscale device, the Motorola Clutch i465, for $130. It has a qwerty keyboard, walkie-talkie capabilities, a camera and GPS function. For $50, Boost provides a month of unlimited texting, talking and surfing. ... T-Mobile’s G1 won’t be the only Google phone for much longer. Perhaps trying to divert some buzz from the Palm Pre announcement, T-Mobile said this week that it would offer another device working on Google’s Android mobile platform, but the company would share no other details. Verizon also recently said it would soon offer an Android-based phone. ... BlackBerry Storm users will have an easier time typing messages because of last week’s software update, which includes a full qwerty keyboard, alongside other improvements. ... IPhone games killing your productivity? Quickoffice might help. The $20 app lets you edit and create Microsoft Word and Excel files on the phone, among other things.
154 2009-06-04 Could all this be irrational exuberance? Current valuations are extremely rich: the price of stocks on the Indian Nifty is more than 20 times earnings. Prices are nearly 21 times earnings on the Bovespa and 29 times earnings on the CSI 300.

The optimistic view is that these price-to-earnings ratios reflect the return of an appetite for risk in the markets, which normally accompanies a more positive outlook, and a belief that these countries are ready to resume strong economic growth.

The skeptical outlook is that the economies would have to leap to double-digit growth rates to justify these valuations and that that could only mean a bubble was forming.

Emerging markets generally swing more wildly, in both directions, than developed countries do. And each of the big developing economies, the so-called BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, face weaknesses that could stunt any recovery.

Exports and foreign investment flows, for instance, which are critical for many developing countries, remain anemic. Government spending has taken up some of the slack, but rising fiscal deficits in places like India could limit how much more policy makers can do to stimulate their economies.

For now, there is little talk of caution. In India, the rising stock market surged even more when the government garnered a bigger majority in national elections last month. Many analysts say they expect the government to expedite economic changes and infrastructure overhauls.

Madhabi Puri-Buch, the chief executive of Icici Securities, in Mumbai, said India would weather the crisis better than other countries because domestic consumption, the primary engine for the economy, was still growing. Sales for the biggest Indian automaker, Maruti Suzuki, for instance, climbed more than 10 percent in May.

Investments also are showing signs of revival. Foreign flows into the stock market have turned positive in recent months. Ms. Buch said companies were raising billions of dollars from institutional investors.

“Most companies in their boardrooms would be saying we need to plan for future growth,” she said, “rather than saying we need to batten down the hatches for a long winter.”

Other analysts say the fundamentals of the Indian economy have not improved enough to justify the big rally.

“There is the potential for this new government to make a significant difference in terms of economic reforms,” said Ajay Shah, a senior fellow at the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy. “I would underline the word potential. There are very big gaps between theory and execution, between promise and reality.”

The Reserve Bank of India expects the economy to grow 6 percent this fiscal year, down from an estimated 6.7 percent last year. Optimists like Ms. Buch said economic growth in India could be as high as 7.5 percent, while the World Bank has forecast 4 percent.

In China, industrial production has started to recover, and imports of commodities have risen. But the rebound is heavily concentrated in domestic sectors that benefit from the government’s stimulus program. Exports are still struggling.

An increase in bank lending has prompted a revival of the real estate market and the car market. The government has also offered $1.02 billion worth of subsidies to people in rural areas for car and home appliance purchases, contributing to a 14 percent increase in overall car sales in the first four months of this year, compared with the period last year.

The situation on the ground tells the tale.

For Wu Guo Fei and Wu Guo Cai, brothers who alter clothes at a sidewalk shop in Dongguan, China, near Hong Kong, the shock of the global financial crisis is slowly starting to fade.

From last summer until December, their monthly revenue shrank by 40 percent as some migrant workers at the nearby furniture and handbag companies, a large part of their customer base, lost jobs.

Laboring over foot-powered sewing machines made in the 1960s, the brothers fretted in the winter as workers left for unpaid vacations. But after Chinese New Year in January, the workers started trickling back. “Maybe 80 percent of the workers came back,” said Wu Guo Cai, 46.

Business is still off nearly 20 percent because of workers who did not return, but those who have come back are spending money.

“We expect manufacturing activity will continue to expand in the coming months, supported by the roll-out of the government’s stimulus,” said Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairman of China equities at JPMorgan Chase.

Outside of China, emerging markets in East Asia are also showing signs of recovering from a steep slowdown in manufactured exports. The Taiwanese economy, for instance, shrank 10.2 percent in the first quarter compared with the period a year ago, but closer relations with mainland China have improved investors’ confidence.

Central banks across the region are maintaining low interest rates, and some, like in the Philippines, are still cutting rates to offset weak exports.

Indonesia has been insulated from the global downturn by its large domestic market and limited reliance on exports, and is benefiting from improving overseas demand for its natural resources.

In Brazil, which has been hurt by the steep drop in commodity prices, industrial production has risen every month since January, though it remains much lower than the corresponding periods last year. The government is predicting that the economy will grow 1 percent this year, down from a previous projection of 3.5 percent. Many independent analysts say Brazil will be lucky to avoid a contraction.

Nonetheless, the Brazilian stock market has risen smartly as investors regain confidence.

“We never thought it would get back to this level so quickly,” said Alessandra Ribeiro, an economist at Tendências, a consulting group. “When there was panic, investors fled to the U.S. to buy Treasury bonds and now they are diversifying again. Brazil is clearly one of those that have been chosen.”
155 2009-06-04 Start practicing your teenage shrieks and squeals of delight: Paul McCartney will be the first musical artist to hold concerts at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens, the concert promoter AEG Live announced on Wednesday. The company said that Mr. McCartney would perform at the stadium on July 17 and 18, and that tickets for the shows would go on sale on June 15. Mr. McCartney, you may recall, was among the first musicians to play at Shea Stadium, the previous home of the New York Mets, when he performed there with the Beatles in 1965. He also made a guest appearance during a 2008 performance by Billy Joel, who was the last musician to hold a concert there.
156 2009-06-04 WASHINGTON  President Obama said Wednesday that he was receptive to Congressional proposals that would require Americans to have health insurance and oblige employers to share in the cost. But he said there should be exemptions for people who cannot afford insurance and for small businesses in general.

Mr. Obama set forth his views in a letter to the chairmen of the two Senate committees writing health care legislation, Max Baucus of Montana and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, both Democrats.

The president said he was open to proposals for “shared responsibility  making every American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost.”

He did not use the terms “individual mandate” and “employer mandate,” which suggest a degree of coercion that Democrats try to avoid implying. Still, the letter provides the fullest statement of Mr. Obama’s views on proposals at the heart of legislation to cover all Americans, his top domestic priority.

“If we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable,” Mr. Obama wrote. “If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it.”

Moreover, the president said, “while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.”

To help pay for coverage of the uninsured, Mr. Obama called on Congress to squeeze $200 billion to $300 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years, on top of the $309 billion in savings he proposed in his budget. Such cutbacks are sure to face resistance from health care providers who would be affected.

Mr. Obama’s letter affirmed his support for creation of a new government-sponsored health plan.

“I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating alongside private plans,” he wrote. “This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market more competitive and keep insurance companies honest.”

Republicans say a public plan could drive private insurers from the market and lead eventually to a single-payer government-run system. They said Wednesday that if Mr. Obama insisted on a public plan, he could wreck the chances of enacting a bipartisan bill.

The president’s letter reaffirmed his “determination to enact a government-run health plan that would raise taxes and ration care,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader.

But Richard J. Kirsch, the national campaign manager of Health Care for America Now, a consumer group, said he was “thrilled to see President Obama’s strong, unambiguous support for a public health insurance option.”

Administration officials said the letter reflected the evolution of Mr. Obama’s views since the election last year. In the presidential primaries, Hillary Rodham Clinton supported requiring everyone to carry insurance. But Mr. Obama said then that the requirement for coverage should at first apply only to children.

The idea of a child-only mandate has not found significant support in Congress, where Democrats favor an individual mandate, with federal subsidies or tax credits to help defray the cost of insurance for people with low or moderate incomes.

The waiver proposed by Mr. Obama is similar to that in Massachusetts, which requires all adults to have health insurance but offers exemptions to people considered unable to afford it.

This year, for instance, Massachusetts considers a premium of $232 a month to be affordable for a family with annual income of $45,781 to $54,936. If residents in that income range cannot obtain a premium that low, either through an employer or in the individual insurance market, they qualify for a waiver. In 2007, the plan’s first year of operation, about 76,000 Massachusetts residents were so qualified.

In Washington, senior House Democrats, including the majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, have said the House bill will include some type of public plan option.

Senate Democrats are by no means unified on that idea, and a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats expressed concern on Wednesday about some proposals for a public plan.

The group, the 51-member Blue Dog Coalition, said the public plan should be available only as a backup, if private insurers did not rein in costs and offer affordable coverage to everyone.

Even then, the Blue Dogs said, the public insurance plan must not be a replica of Medicare, the government-run health program for older Americans; must not use Medicare rates to pay doctors and hospitals; and “must adhere to the same rules and regulations” as private insurers.

“No one knows what the public option will or will not be able to achieve,” said Representative Mike Ross of Arkansas, a Blue Dog leader. “Frankly, it’s an experiment. We cannot create a public option that stacks the deck against a system that currently provides coverage to more than 160 million Americans.”

Mr. Obama said he was “committed to working with the Congress to fully offset the cost of health care reform,” by curbing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and “by enacting appropriate proposals to generate additional revenues.”

The president did not comment on proposals to tax some employer-provided health benefits, an idea favored by Senator Baucus but opposed by labor unions and many employers.
157 2009-06-04 “What’s new is this is plastic surgery being marketed to the public as a widget,” said Dr. Brian Reagan, a plastic surgeon in . “People are buying, so buyer beware.”

In this new landscape, patients are encouraged to seek an advertised procedure rather than work with a surgeon to select from a menu of options. What’s more, some patients are now “looking not for the best doctor, but the one who has the magic wand,” said Dr. Reagan, who has given a lecture titled “Invasion of the Mini-Lifts ... Coming to a Clinic Near You.”

Dr. David M. Kent, an osteopath and facial plastic surgeon who founded Lifestyle Lift, said he employs nearly 100 doctors in 31 offices who are trained to do Lifestyle Lifts. (The company also has 10 doctors in private practice who license its brand.) “Every single patient gets the same basic face-lift,” he said, explaining that it consists of lifting underlying layers of muscle and connective tissue, and trimming skin. Patients also receive custom nips and tucks as needed.

The QuickLift, which roughly 10,000 patients have had since 2003, is sold differently. Doctors who offer it maintain their own practices and might also offer traditional face-lifts. A company, MDCommunications, helps those physicians market the QuickLift by placing television spots and optimizing how fast a doctor is found online.

Dr. Dominic A. Brandy, the developer of the QuickLift, coined the term to describe his adaptation of an S-lift, an operation that uses teardrop-shaped to suspend sagging features. Dr. Brandy said he improved on the S-lift by pulling the face vertically instead of toward the ears.

Currently, 25 to 30 doctors receive patients through . The doctors attended a one-day workshop priced at $1,950 (and sometimes a few other days of training) taught by Dr. Brandy, a cosmetic surgeon with a background in emergency medicine.

Teresa Bradley, 47, found her QuickLift surgeon on the company’s site. Even before meeting him, she had decided QuickLift was for her. “I researched the procedure,” she said. “It was excellent.” But she has agonized over the results. “He lifted one side very high and left the other side hanging,” she said.

Now Ms. Bradley said she realizes the QuickLift is only as good as the surgeon doing it.

In response, Dr. Brandy said, “When you teach somebody a procedure, even if they use the basic same procedure, skill levels are so different.”

The American Society of Plastic Surgeons hasn’t taken a stand on branded procedures. But its president, Dr. John W. Canady, advised, “Go get a second opinion from someone who doesn’t have a big ad.”

Patients should be presented with a range of options, said Dr. David S. Kung, a board-certified plastic surgeon in the , D.C., area. He considers deeper-plane face-lifts “the gold standard,” because they “last the longest and they can effect the maximal change,” he said. But he sees a place for middle-of-the-spectrum face-lifts, which in his opinion, include the QuickLift, Lifestyle Lift and another (nonbranded) lift, the minimal access cranial suspension.

Dr. Kent said that before patients meet a Lifestyle Lift surgeon, they see a consultant and watch a video in which the company’s medical director explains its philosophy. Then they meet with a surgeon before deciding whether to proceed.

But three Lifestyle Lift patients and Dr. Mario S. Yco, a board-certified otolaryngologist who was an employee of the company for about a year, said that patients were urged to put down a deposit before they met with a surgeon.

“The consultant sold the surgery,” said Dr. Yco, who practices in Encinitas, Calif. Often by the time he saw patients, the surgery was booked. “There were many patients I had to cancel,” he said, explaining that he didn’t deem them appropriate candidates.

In response, Dr. Kent said, “It’s never a consultant that decides whether or not a patient should have surgery.” He described the company’s consultants as “people-friendly people.” They make sure patients “understand what they are getting into, explain the things we offer, talk about the doctor,” he said.

Dr. Yco said he was amazed at the power that advertising had over Lifestyle Lift patients. “They are sold by the concept, they are not sold by the surgeon’s credentials,” he said. “Unfortunately if they are not satisfied, it’s a big drop for them.” He added, “It’s like lemmings going down a cliff.”

In May, on the job site Monster.com, the branch of Lifestyle Lift ran an ad seeking applicants to be plastic surgery consultants. “No medical experience needed,” it said, adding that the right candidate would have an “ability to match the offerings of Lifestyle Lift with the desires of Clients.”

Sharron Bryant, a manager for Lindt Chocolates in , who got a Lifestyle Lift in 2007, said she had a “high pressure” consultation and put down a deposit before meeting a surgeon. Ms. Bryant, then 59, paid $6,100 for a Lifestyle Lift and chin . She never needed pain medication during her weeklong recovery, she said.

But she disliked the loose skin that remained on her jowls and neck. “I got nothing for the money,” she said. She later paid $8,200 for a traditional face-lift from a different surgeon.

With “every plastic surgery procedure, there’s a certain number of people afterwards that are unhappy,” Dr. Kent said. “There’s nothing wrong with them medically. They are just dissatisfied.”

On , a Web site where patients discuss cosmetic surgery, 37 percent of the 170 people who reviewed the Lifestyle Lift said the procedure was “worth it,” while 63 percent didn’t think so.

Leigh Floyd, 46, a technical writer in , is an “extremely satisfied” customer of Lifestyle Lift, which she partly attributed to her realistic expectations. “You won’t look 20” afterward, she said, “because it’s still your 40-year-old skin.”

But she was most impressed by the skill of her surgeon, Dr. Kevin R. Smith, a Houston otolaryngologist. “His sutures were so tiny,” she said. “I just know I picked the right doctor.”

Here’s some advice for those considering face-lifts.

Check whether your surgeon is certified by one of the boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties at . They require physicians to complete residency training in a specialty and to pass rigorous oral and written exams.

Before you schedule an operation, meet the surgeon to make sure you’re on the same page. “The best surgeons will give you their honest opinion whether they can achieve what you’re looking for,” said Dr. John W. Canady, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

Don’t settle for a hasty consultation. The downside as well as the upside of an operation should be covered, said Dr. Robert Singer, a plastic surgeon in , Calif.

You should never feel as if you’re being sold a procedure. “If you’re getting a high-pressure sales pitch for a procedure, personally that would worry me,” Dr. Canady said.

It never hurts to get a second opinion.
158 2009-06-04 For more than a year, the Brighter Planet team has been blogging, Tweeting, friending on Facebook and initiating viral marketing campaigns intended to help consumers reduce their carbon footprints.

While most small businesses have not yet embraced social networks as Brighter Planet has, their numbers are growing. According to the April index of Discover Small Business Watch, compiled by Discover Financial Services, 38 percent of owners were a member of an online social networking community, up from 22 percent in October 2007.

Charles H. Matthews, president of the International Council for Small Business, said the key was to view the sites as tools, not toys. “It can certainly help enhance the process of identifying customers, especially in niche markets.”

For Brighter Planet, the niche is the environment. Before Earth Day, for example, it sponsored Earthtweet, an Earth Day Tweet-a-Thon, which has generated 4,200 conservation Tweets and 2,500 followers.

Soon, BrighterPlanet.com will feature a portable social Web application that will allow visitors to calculate the status of their carbon footprints and share what they are doing on conservation on other social platforms like Facebook.

Friends, family and colleagues can immediately see how saving the environment is important to BrighterPlanet members, Ms. Prairie said. “That’s what we find is the beauty of social networking, particularly for environmental-type causes.”

A recent study for Sage North America found that 65 percent of small businesses that used social networking sites said that they felt more comfortable doing so this year than they did last year, and 51 percent said that they had acquired and retained customers because of it.

More than 260,000 North American businesses currently use social networking to promote their businesses, Mr. King said.

In April, Sage, which has 2.9 million small and midsize business customers, introduced its own networking site, SageSpark .com. “We know we’re not the first to the game,” Mr. King said. “Our twist really is the community, tools and services.”

Other niche sites have sprouted recently, like Shustir.com.

Last week, Shustir.com introduced its virtual marketplace, which was started by two former Lehman Brothers colleagues, Shu Kim and Khanh Pham. “It matters where you spend,” Ms. Kim said, echoing the site’s catchphrase. The goal, they said, is to keep Main Street U.S.A. alive.

“We want you to spend with small businesses,” Ms. Pham said. “By doing so, 80 percent of the money goes directly back to the community.”

The site is arranged so owners can create virtual storefronts with photos, video, blogs and store information, and communicate with customers.

“Shustir gives consumers a one-stop destination,” Ms. Kim said, where they can buy from trusted businesses, post about their favorite shops and make recommendations.

Businesses can exchange advice, ideas and information, and network on a site that provides them search optimization.

In its second phase, Shustir will add Facebook and Twitter badges so owners can use other social media to build business. There will also be a shared community calendar. “The call to localism is existing across the country,” Ms. Pham said, “because small business is suffering.”

PartnerUp has been around longer. It is a social networking site that helps entrepreneurs and small-businesses owners find partners or co-founders, network, ask for and offer up advice, find resources and create or join groups based on their interests. It was founded in 2005 and acquired by the Deluxe Corporation in 2008.

PartnerUp has more than 100,000 active members, and more than 300,000 unique business owners and entrepreneurs come to the site every month, according to Steve Nielsen, its president.

“We’re at an inflection point now,” Mr. Nielsen said, “where social media sites that are specific to a purpose for a market are going mainstream, and they’re not just for early adopters any more.”

In late 2007, David Reinke joined PartnerUp for a specific purpose. He had quit corporate America to start a fashion rating Web site, StyleHop.com, but needed a partner well versed in technology. He posted a profile on PartnerUp, and a job description for a chief technology officer and said, “Let’s see what happens.”

About a month later, Froilan Mendoza, who had 12 years experience building technology start-ups, contacted him and after a series of discussions, Mr. Mendoza quit his job to become chief technology officer of StyleHop.com.

Turning to PartnerUp, Mr. Reinke said, was consistent with how he uses online sites. “I was looking for something specific. I go to the source where the experts are,” Mr. Reinke said. PartnerUp also allowed for a quiet search and limited exposure, he added, so thousands of people would not know about his start-up.

To be sure, the majority of smaller concerns have not caught the online wave. In its monthly index, Discover noted that 62 percent of businesses still do not have Web sites.

What’s more, when asked which networking opportunities they used most, 46 percent of small-business owners identified traditional methods like conferences, trade shows, local in-person groups or chambers of commerce. Of the remaining respondents, 16 percent cited “other” networking opportunities, 8 percent cited online sites, 7 percent said e-mail messages and 22 percent said they were not sure.

Mr. King of Sage North America estimates that small businesses have a 12-month window to figure out online social networking. “I hate to say it, but if they don’t, they’ll get left in the dust,” he said. “It’s here to stay.”
159 2009-06-04 The posted idea that gets the most public votes wins $10,000. On stage and on the Web site, the ideas are called blobs — a prospective buzzword intended to suggest that the ideas are like lumps of clay, potent but unstructured, ready to change into whatever shape will help them thrive.

It is a service to the small-business community with some growth potential. And right now the whole enterprise exists like a circus tent in a tornado.

Ideablob is owned by the Advanta Corporation, which spun off the unit in 2007 as a project of Mr. Kassar’s innovation department. Yes, that Advanta: the big issuer of credit cards to small businesses, based outside Philadelphia in Spring House, Pa., that recently entered lockdown mode.

Last month, in the wake of a $76 million first-quarter loss, Advanta said it would suspend further lending to its cardholders, meaning that as many as a million account holders would need to find credit elsewhere. Last week, the planned credit freeze date of June 10 was moved to May 30.

Although Advanta is still in business, collecting payments from existing customers, the company’s future is in question. But for now, the blobs will carry on.

“We’re plugging away,” said Mr. Kassar, who landed at Advanta eight and a half years ago as a refugee from a failed start-up during the Internet bubble. Even Advanta’s chief executive, Dennis J. Alter, is standing behind the blobs, for now.

“A logical question would be, ‘With earnings and losses and delinquencies being what they are, how come you’re doing this?’ ” Mr. Alter said. “Well, as I’m sure as you can tell, putting on one of these events is not very expensive. For about $1,000 an event, we’re in a way branding Advanta as being valuable to the small-business owner or start-up. Six months from now, maybe we have bloblives in 30 cities around the country. Or maybe we don’t.”

Exactly why Advanta needs to brand itself for small businesses — now that its future in serving them is in doubt — is not entirely clear. Mr. Kassar said the company was keeping its options open. “We may well be active in that market again. Anything is possible.” The first live blob event is free, after that it costs $10 for a single event or $20 for all the events in a month.

Some of those who have shared their blobs on the Web site and on stage have come away feeling warmly about Advanta. Naomi Bar-Yam, executive director of the Mothers’ Milk Bank of New England, said the $10,000 ideablob prize that her nonprofit group won in January 2008 went toward equipment and education. “People don’t even know what a milk bank is,” she said. The group stores and distributes human milk, but just as important, “it put our name out there,” she said. “We got some attention in places we might not have.”

Matt Allison, then a student at Pennsylvania State University, won the $10,000 prize in May 2008 for a concept called BrioBody, a portable touch-screen device with personal training software that would link to a Web site and track an individual’s fitness. His prize “went straight into development of the Web site,” he said, and he was able to raise an additional $25,000 in part because of the “market validation of ideablob.” (BrioBody, like a true blob, has changed; when it begins, it will be just a Web site, a sort of Facebook for fitness.)

The bloblive events are free-form and social and occasionally silly. There are no cash prizes, just feedback. Viable business ideas share the night with individuals grasping for what they might do next and how to start.

“You hear a lot of ‘How do I...?’ ” said Jeffrey Donnon, a finance manager at a Philadelphia venture capital firm, First Round Capital, who has attended several of the events.

Like stand-up comedy shows, some people taking the stage are natural performers and some have terrific material — but one does not guarantee the other. When Mike Klusek described PhillyGoesSolar.com at the Helium club, he was holding the microphone too low, looking down to read a prepared statement. His idea was a Web site where consumers can share experiences installing solar power products: Web 2.0 meets Energy 2.0.

But it was merely a concept. Mr. Klusek was offering equity in exchange for help from a Web designer. Live video of the event was captured and streamed on the Web, and online viewers commented through a Twitter feed that was projected on a wall. Someone on Twitter suggested that Mr. Klusek look into the Web site elance.com to hire a freelancer.

Part of the dynamic of the live event — how it transcends a simple business-card swap — is that each blob presentation becomes something of a puzzle for audience members to solve, challenging them to add expertise. When Jeff Greene presented a plan to help cities generate revenue by leasing library space to businesses after hours, the room went silent as the audience digested the idea.

“People are thinking. Their brains are ticking,” Mr. Kassar said. Someone suggested creating a database to match available spaces with groups that might need them.

Next up was Jason Wisdom, whose idea was to print reference books on toilet paper. The crowd groaned. Someone suggested a gag name for the product. Mr. Kassar said, “Are we at a comedy club or an ideas night?”

The bloblive events continue this week in Santa Monica, and next week in Philadelphia. The company is about to announce the $10,000 winner for May’s online contest. It was suggested to Mr. Kassar that, during its next live event at a comedy club, the company could take suggestions for how ideablob might continue to thrive despite Advanta’s struggles.

182 2009-06-05 LOS ANGELES — With the N.B.A.’s age limit under assault by a congressman and a variety of critics, Commissioner David Stern reiterated Thursday that he was happy with the policy and had no interest in abolishing it.

Speaking during a news conference before Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Orlando Magic, Stern also announced that he had fined LeBron James $25,000 for failing to meet with the news media after the Cleveland Cavaliers’ loss to Orlando in the Eastern Conference finals last Saturday.

Stern defended the motives and underpinnings of the age policy, which generally requires players to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school before becoming eligible to play in the N.B.A. The age limit was instituted in 2005 through negotiations with the players union.

“This is not about the N.C.A.A., this is not an enforcement of some social program,” Stern said. “This is a business decision by the N.B.A., which is: We like to see our players in competition after high school.”

In fact, Stern has expressed a desire to raise the age limit to 20 in the next round of collective bargaining. The union wants to repeal the rule.
183 2009-06-05 IN his speech in Cairo yesterday, President Obama acknowledged an important principle: “Elections alone do not make true democracy.” That principle will be tested this weekend when the Lebanese people go to the polls. Many have called for the elections to be free and fair. But few have asked whether this is even possible if Hezbollah — the radical Shiite party with a huge arsenal and a deeply anti-democratic agenda — is viewed as a legitimate participant in the process.

A similar question arose before Hamas’s participation in the 2006 Palestinian Authority elections. Then, as Israeli justice minister, I tried in vain to persuade the international community that to promote democracy it was not enough to focus on the technical conduct of elections, it was necessary to insist that those who sought the benefits of the democratic process accepted its underlying principles as well.

At the time, the counterargument was that the very participation in elections would act as a moderating force on extremist groups. With more accountability, such groups would be tempted to abandon their militant approach in favor of a purely political platform.

But this analysis ignored the possibility that some radical groups sought participation in the democratic process not to forsake their violent agenda but to advance it. For them, electoral participation was merely a way to gain legitimacy — not an opportunity to change. Some of these groups were better seen as “one-time democrats” determined to use the democratic system against itself.

I believe that democracy is about values before it is about voting. These values must be nurtured within society and integrated into the electoral process itself. We cannot offer international legitimacy for radical groups and then simply hope that elections and governance will take care of the rest. In fact, the capacity to influence radical groups can diminish significantly once they are viewed as indispensable coalition partners and are able to intimidate the electorate with the authority of the state behind them.

For this reason, the international community must adopt at the global level what true democracies apply at the national one — a universal code for participation in democratic elections. This would include requiring every party running for office to renounce violence, pursue its aims by peaceful means and commit to binding laws and international agreements. This code should be adopted by international institutions, like the United Nations, as well as regional bodies. It would guide elections monitors and individual nations in deciding whether to accord parties the stamp of democratic legitimacy, and signal to voters that electing an undemocratic party would have negative international consequences for their country.

The intent here is not to stifle disagreement, exclude key actors from the political process or suggest that democracy be uniform and disregard local cultures and values. The goal is to make clear that the democratic process is not a free pass — it is about responsibilities as well as rights. (This is why, for instance, Israel banned the radical Kach movement from the electoral process.)
184 2009-06-05 “Nominee’s Links With Advocates Fuel Her Critics” (front page, May 29) reported that opponents of Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court are likely to point to her past service as a member of the board of directors of LatinoJustice PRLDEF as evidence that she is unsuited for a position on our nation’s highest court. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Judge Sotomayor served on the board of LatinoJustice PRLDEF (then the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund) from 1980 through 1992.

She joined a board on which many prominent lawyers had served, including Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Senator Jacob K. Javits, Ambassador William J. vanden Heuvel, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, the New York State attorney general Robert Abrams and the federal court judges Jose Cabranes and Victor Marrero.

Judge Sotomayor resigned from our board in 1992 when she was appointed to the federal bench by President George H. W. Bush. Judge Sotomayor’s volunteerism, in the years before she became a federal judge, is in the highest tradition of the American legal system: the donation of time by lawyers to advance pro bono publico — the public good — and to defend those who are the most vulnerable in our society.

Contrary to what her detractors would unfairly insinuate, Judge Sotomayor’s past service on our board enhances her superb qualifications.

We at LatinoJustice PRLDEF proudly support Judge Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court and in the face of the current criticism pledge to redouble our resolve to protect Latinos’ rights under the Constitution, the civil rights laws and the Voting Rights Act.
185 2009-06-05 The bank is also in a dispute with regulators over federal aid. Regulators want the bank to pay a substantial amount of money to the government to exit a program set up this year to insure losses on some of its troubled assets. The bank is balking, arguing that it should not pay anything since it did not actually use the program, according to two government officials and a person briefed on the negotiations.

The shake-up may help Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank’s chief executive, hold onto his job if the changes satisfy regulators and shareholders. The Federal Reserve has told the bank that management and board changes were needed because the Fed is concerned about the bank’s ability to manage its risk during the downturn. The government did not tell the bank which board members or executives should lose their jobs, these people said.

“He’s certainly under pressure to show that he is responding to the crisis,” said Rosabeth M. Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “And the chief risk officer is a position that has the most responsibility to ensure that no angle was missed, that no excessive risk was taken.”

A spokesman for the bank said Mr. Lewis and Ms. Brinkley agreed that she would retire, with both believing that the bank needed a new approach to risk. She was at Mr. Lewis’s side as the bank rapidly expanded its credit card and home equity lending, businesses that are causing charge-offs for the bank.

It is hard to tell if the executive change will satisfy shareholders, who voted in April to strip Mr. Lewis of his chairman title.

“The buck stops with the C.E.O., and if the risks are realized, it’s ultimately the C.E.O.’s responsibility,” said Charles Elson, a shareholder and a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

Ms. Brinkley spent the bulk of her career at the bank, rising from the front lines of corporate lending. She ran the bank’s consumer lending and marketing programs before taking over risk management eight years ago. Recently, she was the point person between the bank and the regulators during the stress tests. Ms. Brinkley’s husband, a lawyer, stayed home with their children in recent years.

Ms. Brinkley is the latest in a line of upper-level women on Wall Street to lose their jobs during the financial crisis. In the last 18 months, high-profile women have left Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.

Ms. Brinkley received no bonus last year. But she took home at least $37.2 million during her tenure as Bank of America’s risk chief from 2001 to 2007, according to an analysis by Equilar, a compensation research firm. She is also entitled to pension benefits worth more than $12 million, and potentially millions more in deferred pay and accumulated stock. The figures are based on the 2008 proxy statement, the last time data was publicly available.

Last year, she provided a list of her “tips for survival” to ForbesLife Executive Woman magazine. Her top tip was: “Don’t be preoccupied with proving yourself. I think a lot of energy gets lost in this. It did for me.”

Mr. Curl joined the bank in 1996, when it bought Boatmen’s Bancshares, a bank in Missouri. Since that deal, Mr. Curl has grown close to Mr. Lewis, who led the company in its aggressive acquisitions. Mr. Curl’s primary role was to scope out possible deals and then negotiate the price and terms for them.

Mr. Curl is known to shy from media attention. Early in his career, he worked in Navy intelligence, experience that gives him a certain cachet within the bank. He spends his weekends on a farm in Missouri.

Last year, Mr. Curl was the lead negotiator for the bank’s purchase of Merrill. Many shareholders contend the bank paid too much, but Mr. Curl has not been the target of their complaints.

A House committee on Thursday requested that Mr. Lewis testify in Washington about the Merrill merger on June 11.

Bank of America’s current dispute with regulators centers on a loss-sharing program that was set up in January, when its deal with Merrill hit trouble. In addition to providing an extra $20 billion in fresh capital, the government agreed to share the losses on $118 billion of assets, mostly from Merrill.

It was a program similar to one provided to Citigroup late last year. But Bank of America never signed a formal agreement. And after the stress tests, Mr. Lewis said publicly that he did not plan to use the program.

Regulators contend the bank derived some value in the market from the program, simply because investors knew that it was available. But bank executives point to the drop in the company’s stock price this year and say that the program did not benefit them in the market.

The government is asking the bank to pay to cancel the program, but the bank says it believes it should pay nothing, according to the three people briefed on the negotiations.

The job ahead for the bank’s chief risk officer will not be boring. A spokesman for the bank said Mr. Curl would overhaul the way the bank assesses the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. One area of focus will be credit cards, where the bank would like to lower its loss rates, said Robert Stickler, a spokesman for the bank.

The bank will not hire a replacement for Mr. Curl, who was the chief deal maker, because it does not have plans for any more acquisitions soon.
186 2009-06-05 To maintain its advantage, Apple must preserve the impression that it is far ahead of rivals when it comes to the capabilities and the “cool” factor of its devices.

“If they start making products people don’t want, and start losing users, then Apple’s strategy will run into problems,” said Benjamin Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “If they continue to have an aura where their products are seen as defining the marketplace, they are going to be fine. But that’s going to be the challenge and the opportunity for Apple.”

For now at least, Apple appears to have a comfortable lead in the simmering smartphone battle. In the last two years, it has sold more than 37 million iPhones and the similar-looking iPod Touches, and the devices have become its most profitable product category. Apple’s stock has nearly doubled in the last six months, largely on the iPhone’s inexorable momentum, although it is still down 28 percent from its high in December 2007.

The iPhone has also attracted an enthusiastic community of independent software makers that have created about 40,000 free or low-cost applications for the devices. Apple now celebrates that wide range of programs, from flight simulators to spreadsheets, as one of the major differences between the iPhone and competing systems.

Apple’s goal for next week: to keep the energy, momentum and spotlight focused on the iPhone and away from its rivals, like the new Pre from Palm, a well-reviewed new phone that goes on sale Saturday.

Apple is expected to use its keynote presentation on Monday to demonstrate the new types of programs that can be created on the latest version of the iPhone’s operating system.

Developers will be able to charge for certain features within their programs (perhaps a new level within a game), and applications will be able to send alerts to users even whey they are not actively running. Apple has also said it will show an early version of its latest operating system for the Macintosh, dubbed Snow Leopard.

But talking about new software can be dull. So analysts point to Apple’s need to surprise its fans, and to its dwindling inventory of iPhones in stores, and predict that Apple will introduce a new iPhone model next week as well. Its new tricks could include the ability to record video and an internal compass that will add extra intelligence to the device’s awareness of its location.

“Apple’s objective will be to clearly and strongly show why the iPhone platform is the best for developers, and that means there’s a high probability Apple will announce one or more phones at the conference,” said Michael Abramsky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Satisfying its large audience of developers may be Apple’s most significant challenge. They want to know they can build profitable businesses even if they focus exclusively on the iPhone, and that Apple will continue to do its part by wooing consumers with compelling new gadgets.

“We want to hear that there are going to be cool new devices, because that means our market gets bigger,” said Bart Decrem, the chief executive of Tapulous, a company in Palo Alto, Calif., that makes musical games for the iPhone.

Apple has actually set a high bar for itself. Unlike its rivals Google and Microsoft, which license their mobile operating systems to many phone makers, Apple builds its own hardware and software and carefully strikes exclusive relationships with wireless carriers that are willing to heavily subsidize its devices. The strategy depends on a constant flow of new products that people are willing to switch wireless companies and pay extra to use.

That same strategy — introducing expensive but elegant products with high switching costs — is showing signs of strain in other parts of Apple’s business. Although Apple has performed better lately than other American computer makers, its sales of Mac laptops and desktops declined by 3 percent in the first three months of the year. That was the first time in six years that sales in Apple’s personal computer business had a year-over-year decline.

Meanwhile, the Taiwanese manufacturers of the smaller, cheaper computers called netbooks, like Acer and Asustek, continue to have growing sales.

“Apple has to address the structural slide of the PC industry to more value-priced products,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Collins Stewart.

But Apple is not expected to talk about the Mac next week, and that could be emblematic of one of the largest problems the company faces. Apple watchers and investors have many questions that Apple does not seem to want to answer in public, and they could punish the stock if they come away from the conference disappointed.

The big questions include whether Apple is working on any entirely new product lines (like a much rumored tablet computer), what it might do with its $29 billion hoard of cash, and how Mr. Jobs’s health is faring.

Mr. Jobs, Apple’s innovator in chief, has not been seen in public since last October, when he unveiled a line of laptops at Apple’s headquarters. A survivor of pancreatic cancer, Mr. Jobs has been on medical leave since January. Two people close to his personal circle say he looks healthier, and they expect him to be back at work full time soon. Apple will say only that it still expects Mr. Jobs back at the end of June.

That is one area where the expectations of Apple observers and investors may have fallen somewhat. Apple has thrived in the last six months under the leadership of Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, who has handled day-to-day operations during Mr. Jobs’s absence. If Mr. Jobs does not return, or returns in a diminished role, investors and fans may no longer see it as the end of the world.

“Apple has had a nice rally because they put up very strong numbers, and at the end of the day it will still be all about numbers,” said Mr. Reitzes of Barclays Capital.
187 2009-06-05 “We will see a few transactions,” said Fred Pollock, a vice president at Morgan Stanley Infrastructure, a private equity fund. “But we know what we won’t see — a tidal wave of projects.”

Some big names still want to enter this business, among them Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Such investors have raised about $180 billion for global infrastructure projects. Large funds have also been established in Australia, Britain and Bahrain, where such public-private partnerships are more common. More than 20 states enacted legislation in recent years to allow some form of private-sector investment that would help fill budget gaps and repair crumbling roads, bridges and even airports.

But now the deals are falling apart. In April, a much-anticipated $2.5 billion plan to privatize Midway Airport in Chicago collapsed after a group of investors was unable to obtain debt financing. The deal, which had been in the works for four years, was to have been the first in a Federal Aviation Administration project that would have allowed up to five major airports to move into private hands.

Midway was just the latest setback. The biggest was the failure last fall of the largest deal proposed to date — a $12.8 billion lease of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to an investor group headed by Citigroup and a Spanish investment firm. Postmortems into that failed effort show that privatization advocates vastly underestimated the political opposition the deal would stir up in the Pennsylvania legislature.

Late last month plans to privatize “Alligator Alley,” a 78-mile stretch of Florida highway that connects Fort Lauderdale with Naples, collapsed when no bidders showed up. The failure has had a ripple effect — in Mississippi, state officials have pushed back the bidding schedule for a new 12-mile toll road.

Then there is the $1.2 billion privatization of 36,000 parking meters in Chicago. In the five months since the deal took effect, widespread complaints about poor service and rising parking rates have created a political firestorm for the Chicago City Council. Public opposition was so strong that on Wednesday the council approved a delay in voting on any future asset sales.

Chicago public officials have called the work of the private operator, Chicago Parking Meters L.L.C., “simply unacceptable.” For its part, the operator has apologized and announced it would delay price increases at the meters.

Proponents of public-to-private asset sales point to the $1.8 billion lease of the 7.8-mile Chicago Skyway in 2004 and the $3.8 billion raised by Indiana through a 75-year lease of its toll road in 2006 as successful pioneering efforts.

In Indiana, the money went to pay for a 10-year highway infrastructure program, and Gov. Mitch Daniels was re-elected last year promoting the lease, despite bumper stickers that read “Keep the Toll Road, Lease Mitch.”

The stimulus money, as well as other infrastructure money promised by Congress, has provided temporary relief for cash-poor municipalities. But this situation will not last forever.

“They still have expenses, and revenues will not keep up,” Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said of state and local governments. “Some states will have to look at asset sales and decide. Once we step back from this crisis mode, I think they will be looked at again.”

If the market revives, the problems that scuttled recent deals may provide some lessons. In the case of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, politics clearly played a role in the deal’s collapse. A study by the Pew Center on the States found that proponents of the deal had overpromised what the turnpike could fetch and had failed to make it clear where the money would go.

After indicating that the turnpike might be valued at as much as $26 billion, when the winning $12.8 billion bid came in lawmakers felt it looked too small. Even more, there was concern that the money would be squandered and that the state was putting a valuable asset into foreign hands, since the top bidder included a Spanish company.

“It simply wasn’t a sufficient bid by a long shot,” said Joseph F. Markosek, a state legislator and head of the Pennsylvania House Transportation Committee.

Similar sentiments are coming into play in Florida, where few had expected Alligator Alley to be leased. “I believe the private partnership is like fool’s gold,” said David Aronberg, a state senator in south Florida who has led the fight against privatization. “It only looks good from afar.”
188 2009-06-05 The Intel Corporation said Thursday that it had agreed to buy Wind River Systems, a software company, for about $884 million in a bid to put its chips into more consumer electronics and wireless devices.

Intel said it had agreed to pay $11.50 a share for Wind River, a 44 percent premium over its closing price on Wednesday.

Wind River makes operating systems for platforms as diverse as autos and mobile phones, serving customers like Sony and Boeing.

Intel, whose processors run about 80 percent of the world’s personal computers, is expanding into new markets, including chips for televisions and mobile devices. Wind River’s software and customer list will pave the way for Intel to win more chip contracts, said Cody Acree, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Company in Dallas.

“If you have a chip you want to put in a lot of things other than a PC, you need code,” Mr. Acree said. “Wind River brings that, and it brings customers.”

Shares of Wind River, which is based in Alameda, Calif., rose $3.76, or 47 percent, to $11.76 a share. Shares of Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose 19 cents, to $16.13 a share.

It is Intel’s first major acquisition since Paul S. Otellini took over as chief executive in 2005.

Intel expects chips for so-called embedded systems, like the electronics in car navigation systems, to generate billions of dollars in annual sales, said Bill Kircos, a company spokesman. Intel already supplies chips to BMW for car stereos that use Wind River software.
189 2009-06-05 The Hartford Financial Services Group said Thursday that its chief executive, Ramani Ayer, 62, would retire by the end of the year. The insurer has been under pressure from shareholders as it struggles with record losses, and is expected to receive $3.4 billion in taxpayer funds.

Hartford said in a statement that it was looking outside the company for a successor.

Shareholders questioned Mr. Ayer’s leadership after Hartford reported billions of dollars in losses over the last three quarters, leading the company to cut major international operations and reduce its dividend by 84 percent.

The announcement is the latest in a string of senior management changes at Hartford since last year. David M. Johnson, who had been the company’s chief financial officer, resigned in May 2008. And its chief operating officer, Thomas M. Marra, seen by many as a possible successor to Mr. Ayer, announced in February that he would step down and also quit the board immediately.
190 2009-06-05 Airspeed on jets is measured by the combination of a tube that faces forward, called a Pitot tube, and an opening on the side of the plane known as a static port. The plane’s speed is determined by comparing the pressure in the Pitot tube that is created by the oncoming wind with the pressure from the static port.

The model that crashed, an A330, has three pairs of tubes and static ports. But other instruments can also be involved in calculating air speed, and the notice to airlines, called an Accident Information Telex, did not specify the nature of the inconsistency.

The message went to airlines that operate all Airbus models, from narrow-body A318 models to the double-decker jumbo A380.

Failure to manage an inconsistency properly has been cited in several crashes of big jets from various manufacturers. In 1996, a Boeing 757 taking off from the Dominican Republic crashed because the airspeed indicators of the captain and the first officer disagreed, and the crew mismanaged the problem. Mud wasps had nested in one of the Pitot tubes.

A plane that flies too slow can lose lift and crash; too fast and it can break up in the air.

The Airbus notice referred to the Quick Reference Handbook and the Flight Crew Operating Manual, which is a more detailed volume that is also kept in the cockpit. For all the models, however, the advice is the same: keep the plane level and keep the throttle setting in place while troubleshooting.

The ability to fix the problem in flight would depend, of course, on its source. With only limited information available, and without the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder, experts around the world could not do much more than speculate. A series of system failures could be set off by an on-board fire, by a failure that allowed ice buildup on a critical instrument, or by a variety of other causes, experts said.

The Airbus notice pointed out that the airplane was crossing an area of multiple thunderstorms at the time of the accident early Monday. Severe thunderstorms can cause crashes, although it is not clear whether the conditions that the flight encountered, on its planned route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, were unusual.

At AccuWeather.com, a commercial weather service, forecasters calculated that thunderstorms in the region of the crash could have generated updrafts in the range of 100 miles per hour, although Daniel G. Kottlowski, a senior meteorologist, conceded that this was not unusual weather. He noted that one message sent out automatically by the plane indicated the cabin had depressurized, and he suggested perhaps this had forced the crew to descend into breathable air — and a more intense part of the storm.
191 2009-06-05 Investors are growing concerned that the government’s huge spending projects could lead to a round of inflation once the economy begins to recover, driving commodity prices higher and pulling Treasury prices even lower. Some analysts worry such a move could stifle consumer spending and throw the economy into deeper trouble.

“All the actions the Treasury has taken to drag us out of the muck are going to come back to bite us,” said James D. King, president of National Penn Investors Trust.

On Thursday, crude oil futures for July rose $2.69 to $68.81 a barrel after Goldman Sachs said that oil prices could surge to $85 a barrel by the end of the year. Just a few months ago, some oil analysts were predicting that oil could sink to $20 a barrel as the economy stayed mired in recession.

John Kilduff, senior vice president of energy at MF Global, said he was seeing a new species in the markets to complement the so-called bond vigilantes who drove up bond yields decades ago in protest of the government’s monetary and fiscal policies. Enter the commodity vigilantes, he said.

“There’s a new crew of commodity market vigilantes out there as well, buying up hard assets in anticipation of how beaten up the dollar could get as a result of these moves by the Fed and Treasury,” Mr. Kilduff said. “There’s a real concern out there.”

The prices of copper, wheat, sugar, silver and platinum also rose on Thursday, and gold rose to $980 an ounce. Even though those commodities and others have rebounded sharply this spring, analysts said that global demand for raw materials has remained depressed, and they did not expect a speedy recovery would revive industrial output soon.

“It’s unnerving,” Mr. Kilduff said. “You have a hard time squaring the fundamental picture of supply and demand with these price rises.”

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.96 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 8,750.24 while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 10.7 points, or 1.2 percent, to 942.46. The Nasdaq was 1.3 percent higher, closing at 1,850.02.

Financial stocks led the way higher after analysts upgraded several banks, encouraging investors to put their money back into a section of the market that fell the hardest as the financial crisis took hold. Goldman Sachs rose 5.2 percent to $149.47 after an analyst upgraded its stock. Bank of America and Citigroup each gained more than 5 percent.

Retailers were mixed after another anemic month of sales in May, and energy producers like Exxon Mobil and Chevron rose on higher oil prices.

But investors shunned longer-term Treasury notes for another day, pushing the price of the benchmark 10-year note down 1 12/32 to 95 5/32. The yield rose to 3.71 percent, from 3.54 percent late Wednesday.

The rising yields on Treasuries are rippling through to mortgage markets. On Thursday, Freddie Mac said the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to an average 5.29 percent this week, from 4.9 percent. The Federal Reserve is buying billions in securities to contain borrowing costs, but analysts said the steady rise in rates suggested that bond investors were undoing those efforts.

“It would be a detriment to early recovery if rates do trend higher,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.

198 2009-06-06 The leader of Lance Armstrong’s Astana team said Friday that its financial crisis had not been solved and that protests against its Kazakh backers would continue during a preparation race for the Tour de France.

Kazakhstan’s cycling federation, however, said early Friday that it had paid its debts to Astana, clearing the way for the team to take part in the Tour.

“The debt issue has not been solved,” the team leader, Johan Bruyneel, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “The situation has not changed for us” since the Giro d’Italia, which ended last week.

Armstrong, meanwhile, posted a message on his Twitter account announcing that his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, had given birth to their son, Max. Armstrong has three children with his ex-wife, Kristin.

201 2009-06-06 WASHINGTON — The Obama administration’s nominee to lead intelligence efforts at the Department of Homeland Security withdrew Friday after it became clear that lawmakers would raise questions about his role in the Bush administration’s interrogation programs.

Philip Mudd, who has 24 years of intelligence experience, said in a letter to the White House that he worried that his nomination could become a “distraction” from President Obama’s agenda.

Mr. Mudd is now a deputy in Federal Bureau of Investigation’s counterterrorism unit. Before that, he was deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency’s Counterterrorism Center. It was in the latter post that legislators believed Mr. Mudd became deeply involved with the government’s enhanced interrogation efforts, including the use of the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding.

A White House aide said the president was well aware of Mr. Mudd’s links with interrogation programs that the Obama administration has described as torture. Still, the aide said Mr. Obama had complete confidence that Mr. Mudd was the best person for the Homeland Security post.

But the aide said Mr. Mudd had become increasingly concerned that his nomination would lead to another angry political debate in Congress over torture. It would come at a time when the president wants Congress to press forward on health care and Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

A White House spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said Mr. Obama had regretfully accepted Mr. Mudd’s withdrawal, adding, “Phil once again demonstrated his duty to country above all things.”
202 2009-06-06 “It’s always fun to see people try to break records,” said Paul Annacone, Sampras’s longtime coach, in a telephone interview from London on Friday. “Obviously, I didn’t think Pete’s record would be caught so quickly. But Roger has just had such an amazing run. He’s such a class act, and it couldn’t happen to a better guy. I hope it’s a good day Sunday. I hope it’s good tennis, and I’d like to see him hold that trophy up at the end of it.”

Annacone said that view is shared by Sampras, who has become friendly with Federer in retirement through playing exhibitions. “I talked with Pete two weeks ago in L.A., and he said he didn’t think the record would be caught that quickly either, but he said, ‘Roger is a great guy and great player, so hats off if he gets there and passes it because I know how hard it was to do.’ ”

There are some eerie parallels. When Sampras won his 14th major title, his wife, Bridgette Wilson, was pregnant with their first child and watching from the stands in New York. On the verge of his 14th, Federer’s new wife, Mirka Vavrinec, is pregnant with their first child as she watches him in Paris.

“I’m doing great,” Vavrinec said Friday after her husband’s latest five-set escape.

If Federer beats Soderling, he will have accomplished one feat that Sampras never quite managed: a complete set of Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras, despite occasional triumphs on clay elsewhere, advanced to only one semifinal at the French Open and never reached the final.

This will be Federer’s fourth straight final in Paris and the first in which he will not have to worry about Rafael Nadal’s left-handed topspin forehand kicking high to Federer’s one-handed backhand.

“Maybe you’ll miss him, but not me,” Federer said to reporters. “I’ve played him 20 times. It’s nice to play someone else, too. I know that I’ll be playing him plenty more times in the future.”

Without Nadal, Federer might already have won multiple titles in Paris, but without Federer, Nadal might already have won Wimbledon more than once. Playing the game of what-if in tennis is diverting but far from conclusive, which is also true of comparing greatness across eras.

“I think if he wins, you’d have to say Federer’s record is the greatest of the Open era,” said Brad Gilbert, the American commentator and coach. “But the greatest of all time? I really don’t think you can say that. Too much has changed to really compare.”

The Open era began in 1968 and allowed professionals to compete without restrictions in the four Grand Slam tournaments, which had been open only to amateurs, or at least to those who were able to hide their tennis revenue.

In the two decades after World War II, many top amateurs made their names and then quickly turned professional to join barnstorming tours like those run by the American star Jack Kramer. The result was that until 1968 very few players had the opportunity to amass large numbers of Grand Slam singles titles, with Roy Emerson of Australia, who remained amateur, being one of the exceptions by winning 12 over all.

To cite just two examples, Pancho Gonzalez of the United States and Lew Hoad of Australia, who both make many experts’ lists of greatest players, had brief amateur careers. Gonzalez won just two United States Open singles titles; Hoad won four major singles titles.

Rod Laver, the Australian left-hander nicknamed Rocket, is often considered the greatest player because he was the only man to complete the Grand Slam twice by winning all four major singles titles in the same calendar year. Laver did it in 1962 as an amateur and in 1969 as a professional.

He won 11 major singles titles in all but was ineligible to play them as a professional from 1963 to 1967. Many argue that Laver would ultimately have won far more than 14 if he had been eligible to play Grand Slam events during that five-year period, but the flip side is that he would have faced stiffer competition if other professional stars had also been eligible.

“Laver and those guys weren’t going for any record,” Gilbert said. “They didn’t know any record existed like Grand Slams in a career. It didn’t mean anything to them.”

Even in the professional era, there are pitfalls to comparisons, because the Australian Open was once undervalued and regularly snubbed by leading players because of logistics and its Christmas-holiday time slot. Bjorn Borg, the five-time Wimbledon champion and six-time French Open champion, played the Australian only once in his career, losing in the third round in 1974. Jimmy Connors played it twice, winning in 1974.

Sampras played it 11 times, winning it twice. Andre Agassi, Sampras’s longtime American rival, played it nine times and won it on four occasions. Federer has played it 10 consecutive times and won it three times.

The comparison game is indeed tricky, and it also bears mentioning that the Davis Cup, the men’s team competition that began in 1900, was long considered a must for a great tennis player. Federer has yet to win it for Switzerland while Sampras won it twice for the United States.

What is clear is that if Federer wins on Sunday, he will belong on every short list of Grand Slam tennis greatness. Only five men have won all four major singles titles during their careers: Fred Perry of Britain, Don Budge of the United States, Emerson, Laver and Agassi. Budge and Laver are the only men to have completed true Grand Slams, and Agassi is the only man to have won his titles on three different surfaces, because he played after the Australian Open and the United States Open switched from grass to hardcourts.

If Federer wins, his achievement at all four majors will be without equivalent. He has won three titles and reached four finals in Australia. He has reached the final four times in Paris. He has won five titles and reached six finals at Wimbledon. And he has taken five titles at the United States Open.

He has achieved all this in a seven-year span and is still just 27.

“It is amazing,” Annacone said. “If he wins in Paris and someone tells me he’s the greatest ever, I can totally understand why they would say that. But the most exciting part is it’s still an unfinished book. Let’s enjoy the rest of the book.”
203 2009-06-06 There are few 9-year-olds whose lives would merit an entire book, but Rubina Ali Qureshi, below, a young star of the movie “Slumdog Millionaire,” may be the exception. On Friday, Transworld Publishers in London said that it would publish the life story of Rubina, who was recruited from a Mumbai slum for the Academy Award-winning film, in a book called “Slumgirl Dreaming: My Journey to the Stars,” The Associated Press reported. Since the release of the movie, Rubina has accumulated enough material for a second book: a British tabloid said her father had tried to offer her for adoption in exchange for money (the police in Mumbai said they could not find evidence of this), and her family’s shanty home was demolished by the authorities in preparation for India’s monsoon season (state officials said the family would be given a new home in suburban Mumbai). A publication date for the book was not given; proceeds from its sales will go to Rubina and the French medical organization Médecins du Monde.
204 2009-06-06 DAKAR, Senegal — Two prominent politicians were killed in Guinea-Bissau on Friday, just three months after the killings of the country’s president and army chief.

The authorities in the foundering West African nation said that they had thwarted a coup attempt and that there had been “fatal victims” after intervention by the military police.

The local United Nations office, however, called the killings “murder.”

The victims were not identified in the Interior Ministry’s communiqué, but the United Nations office in Bissau, the capital, identified them as Baciro Dabo, a candidate in the coming presidential elections, and Helder Proença, a member of Parliament and former minister of defense.

Officials said Mr. Proença was the leader of the coup attempt.

A third well-known figure, former Prime Minister Faustino Embali, was arrested, according to the United Nations, though several news reports said he had also been killed.

Calls to government ministries in Bissau were not answered Friday. Diplomats and observers there said the atmosphere remained calm despite the killings.
205 2009-06-06 He continued: “The incredibly inaccurate efficient market theory was believed in totality by many of our financial leaders, and believed in part by almost all. It left our economic and government establishment sitting by confidently, even as a lethally dangerous combination of asset bubbles, lax controls, pernicious incentives and wickedly complicated instruments led to our current plight. ‘Surely, none of this could be happening in a rational, efficient world,’ they seemed to be thinking. And the absolutely worst part of this belief set was that it led to a chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking.”

I couldn’t help thinking about Mr. Grantham’s screed as I was reading Justin Fox’s new book, “The Myth of The Rational Market,” an engaging history of what might be called the rise and fall of the efficient market hypothesis.

Mr. Fox is a business columnist for Time magazine (and a former colleague of mine) who has long been interested in academic finance. His thesis, essentially, is that the efficient marketeers were originally on to a good idea. But sealed off in their academic cocoons — and writing papers in their mathematical jargon — they developed an internal logic quite divorced from market realities. It took a new group of young economists, the behavioralists, to nudge the profession back toward reality.

Mr. Fox argues, echoing Mr. Grantham, that the efficient market hypothesis played an outsize role in shaping how the country thought and acted in the last 30-plus years. But Mr. Fox parts company with him by also arguing that the effect wasn’t necessarily all bad. As for the question of whether an academic theory hatched in Chicago led to the financial crisis, suffice it to say that some questions can never be answered definitively. Which isn’t to say they shouldn’t be asked.

“There are no easy ways to beat the market,” Mr. Fox said when I spoke to him a few days ago. If you want to point to the single best thing the efficient market hypothesis taught us, that is the lesson: we can’t beat the market. Indeed, the vast majority of professional money managers can’t beat the market either, at least not on a regular basis.

As Mr. Fox describes it, much of the early academic work that led to the efficient market theory was aimed at simply showing that most predictive stock charts were glorified voodoo — just because a pattern had developed didn’t mean it would continue, or even that it had any real meaning. Dissertations were written showing how 20 randomly chosen stocks outperformed actively managed mutual funds. (Hence the phrase “random walk,” to connote the near impossibility of beating the market regularly.) Mr. Thaler, the Chicago behavioralist, says that evidence on this point — “the no free lunch principle,” he calls it — is clear and convincing.

In time, this insight led to the rise of passive index funds that simply matched the market instead of trying to beat it. Unless you’re Warren Buffett, an index fund is where you should put your money. Even people who don’t follow that advice know they should.

As it turns out, Mr. Grantham was an early advocate of index funds, mainly for unsophisticated investors who have no hope of beating the market. But he also believes that professionals should do better precisely because, as he puts it, “the market is full of major league inefficiencies.”

“There are incredible aberrations,” he told me over lunch not long ago. “The U.S. housing market in 2007. Japan in the 1980s. Nasdaq. In 2000, growth stocks were three times their fair value. We were quoted in The Economist in 2000 saying that the Nasdaq would drop by 75 percent. In an efficient world, you wouldn’t have that in a lifetime. If the market were truly efficient, it would mean that growth stocks had become permanently more valuable.”

As Mr. Grantham sees it, if professional investors had been willing to acknowledge these aberrations — and trade on the fact that the market was out of whack — they should have been able to beat the market. But thanks to the efficient market hypothesis, no one was willing to call a bubble a bubble — because, after all, stock prices were rational.

“It helped mold the ‘this time it’s different’ mentality,” he said. Indeed, professional money managers who tried to buck the tide wound up losing their jobs — because everybody else was making money by riding the bubble for all it was worth. Meanwhile, government officials, starting with Alan Greenspan, were unwilling to burst the bubble precisely because they were unwilling to even judge that it was a bubble. “Our default reflex is that the world knows what it is doing, and that is extravagant nonsense,” Mr. Grantham said.

But as much as I’ve admired Mr. Grantham’s writings over the years, I think the truth, in this case, is a little more subtle. Given the long history of bubbles, I suspect this crisis would have taken place with or without the aid of the efficient market hypothesis. People thought “it’s different this time” in the 1920s, long before anyone was writing about efficient markets. And over the course of history, professional money managers have been just as fearful of bucking the trend as they were during the Internet bubble.

Mr. Fox sees it somewhat differently. On the one hand, he says, the efficient market theoreticians always assumed that smart market participants would force stock prices to become rational. How? By doing exactly what they don’t do in real life: take the other side of trades if prices get out of whack. Their ivory tower view reflected an idealized market that simply doesn’t exist.

On the other hand, Mr. Fox says, what was truly pernicious about the efficient market hypothesis is the way it allowed us to put asset prices on a pedestal that they never deserved. Stock options — supposedly based on a rational price — became prevalent in part because higher stock prices were supposed to be the rational reward for good performance.

Or take the modern emphasis on market capitalization. “At some point in the early 1990s (or maybe it was in the late 1980s), market capitalization became accepted as the best measure of a company’s importance,” Mr. Fox wrote me in an e-mail message. “Before then it was usually profits or revenue. I think that’s a classic example of the way efficient market theory seeped into popular discourse and shaped how we perceived the world. It wasn’t entirely stupid — profits and revenue are flawed, limited measures, and market value does tell you something useful about a company. But it was another one of the ways in which asset prices came to rule the world, which eventually turned out to be a bad thing.”

A few days ago, I called Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economist, to ask him what he thought of Mr. Grantham’s theories. Mr. Malkiel is the author of “A Random Walk Down Wall Street,” surely one of the greatest popularizers of any academic theory that’s ever been written.

“It’s ridiculous” to blame the financial crisis on the efficient market hypothesis, Mr. Malkiel said. “If you are leveraged 33-1, and you’re holding long-term securities and using short-term indebtedness, and then there’s a run on the bank — which is what happened to Bear Stearns — how can you blame that on efficient market theory?”

But then we started talking about bubbles. “I do think bubbles exist,” he said. “The problem with bubbles is that you cannot recognize them in advance. We now know that stock prices were crazy in March of 2000. We know that condo prices were nuts.”

I thought to myself: if a smart guy like Burton Malkiel had to wait for the Internet bubble to end to realize we had been in one, then maybe Mr. Grantham has a point after all.
206 2009-06-06 Femi Kuti’s band, Positive Force, danced its way onstage at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza on Thursday night. Guitarists swayed in unison, horn players strutted, female backup singers shimmied and bumped, and they all moved to Mr. Kuti’s directions — left, right, down to the ground — after he made his entrance. The women kept shaking and swiveling their hips virtually nonstop through the set, to a beat that merges rhythms from Mr. Kuti’s home, Nigeria, with funk, swing and reggae. As they danced, they sang choruses like “Stop AIDS, fight AIDS.” For Mr. Kuti, in a family tradition, dance music carries messages.

The rhythm is Afrobeat, which was forged by Mr. Kuti’s father, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, from the 1970s until his death in 1997 (of complications from AIDS). It is virtually inseparable from protest and a social conscience. In “You Better Ask Yourself,” from Femi Kuti’s most recent album, “Day by Day” (Mercer Street), the lyrics wonder why Africa, with all its natural resources, still has the “majority of the poorest people.” Often, the songs rail against a problem that both Fela and Femi Kuti have condemned: government corruption.

On May 28, as Femi Kuti was preparing for the United States tour that started with Thursday’s concert, the state government announced a permanent shutdown of the club he and a sister built in Lagos, the New Afrika Shrine, citing “noise nuisance, illegal street trading, indiscriminate parking, blocking of access roads and obstruction of traffic.” (It is named after the Shrine, his father’s club from the ’70s and a center of defiance until it was shut down by the government after Fela’s death.) This permanent closing didn’t last; the New Afrika Shrine was allowed to reopen on Tuesday. Onstage, Mr. Kuti spoke about the closing and the reopening, saying that the Nigerian government was not strong enough to send him to prison, as it had his father, or it would have already done so. Then he called for a united Africa.

Mr. Kuti’s Afrobeat moves in ways established by his father. Behind Mr. Kuti’s vocals, it can simmer along, with accents flickering on high-hat cymbal and snare drum amid rippling keyboards and guitar. It can ease back, turning into a subdued midtempo pulse, for guitar and horn solos that approach jazz. And it can switch into brawny funk when the horn section kicks in with choppy, insistent lines anchored by baritone saxophone. Femi Kuti adds variations of his own: passages of vocal counterpoint, undercurrents of a hip-hop beat and, especially on the new album, hints of Caribbean rhythms.

The set was more party than protest. As a bandleader — who sings and plays trumpet, alto saxophone or electric organ in various songs — Mr. Kuti is a master of dynamics. Each song shifted repeatedly between smooth and punchy, triggering a new burst of dancing with every change. But there was no mistaking Mr. Kuti’s didactic mission. Even when he turned to the subject of sex in the set’s finale, “Beng Beng Beng,” he proffered advice and instructions — about not rushing things — as the Afrobeat groove pulsated and surged behind him.
207 2009-06-06 A reputed Ku Klux Klansman will remain in prison after an appeals court ruled that his conviction should not have been thrown out in the kidnappings of two black teenagers who were slain in 1964. The man, James F. Seale, 73, was found guilty in 2007 of abducting the teenagers, Charles E Moore and Henry H. Dee; the authorities said they were beaten, weighted down and thrown, possibly still alive, into a Mississippi River backwater. Mr. Seale was serving three life sentences in the kidnappings when the conviction was thrown out last year by a three-judge panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The panel’s decision was overturned by the full court.
208 2009-06-06 While several business groups, transportation experts and lawmakers in both parties have called for raising the gasoline tax to meet transportation needs, the Obama administration has made it clear that it opposes raising the tax in a recession.

“The administration has inherited a system that can no longer pay for itself,” Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Thursday at a hearing in the House, where he pledged to act this summer to address the expected shortfall. “We must think creatively as we search for sustainable funding mechanisms.”

The federal gas tax is not a percentage of the amount of money spent, like a sales tax, but rather a flat 18.4-cent tax levied on each gallon of gasoline sold. It has not been raised since 1993, even as the price of gas has doubled. Officials also say inflation has eroded about a third of the tax’s purchasing power since 1993.

Hopes that the tax issue will be resolved before the transportation law expires Sept. 30 dimmed this week when the House put off action on the bill until after its Fourth of July recess. That means Congress could be forced to bail out the trust fund this summer and then temporarily extend the transportation law, instead of passing a new measure that would put the program on firmer footing for the long haul.

But an aide to Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said this week that Mr. Oberstar wanted a new transportation bill and would not support a temporary extension. As a pressure tactic, Mr. Oberstar is threatening to bring federally financed road work to a halt if a new bill is not passed.

Others in Congress have suggested that it is unlikely that a transportation bill can be adopted this summer. Both houses are focused on other priorities, including sweeping health care legislation. That would leave only a few weeks in September to get the transportation bill done, a narrow window for such a complex and expensive measure.

“They’ve got so many fish to fry that we’re getting out in the back of the barbecue line,” said Pete Ruane, president of the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, a major industry group, who nonetheless pronounced himself optimistic that a bill could be passed in time.

Mr. Ruane said it was vital for Congress to shore up the trust fund before it ran out of money this summer, to preserve construction jobs.

“If they delay on the short-term fix,” he said, “they will have negated a large part of the stimulus package. These jobs could go away. When people don’t see a long-term, consistent flow of revenue, they’re not going to buy equipment, they’re not going to hire people.”

Even as business groups and lawmakers in both parties have called for raising the gas tax, some fear that the move toward more fuel-efficient cars could make that only a temporary fix. A federal commission recently recommended raising the tax by 10 cents a gallon, but said that the nation should ultimately devise a way to tax people based on how many miles they drive, not on how much gasoline they use.

As the question of how to pay for transportation has taken on new urgency, the question of what kind of transportation to pay for has not gone away. Transportation for America, a broad coalition of groups including environmentalists but also the National Association of Realtors and AARP, is calling for more spending on mass transit and rail, to reduce dependence on foreign oil, cut pollution and ease traffic.

Traditionally, spending on highways has outstripped spending on mass transit by roughly four to one. Some people were given hope that the ratio could be lowered when the Obama administration made sure that the stimulus bill included more money for faster rail service.
209 2009-06-06 My wife and I were clients of Mr. Weitzman, and I wrote about my discovery of the accusations against him in an April column. (It’s linked from the version of this story at .) After the article ran, a number of people wrote in or posted comments online criticizing my judgment, opinions and qualifications to write this column.

So as the association gathers for its annual meeting, which runs through Saturday, with little about the accusations against its members on the official agenda, let me revisit a few of the points I made last time and suggest a few new ones that may help people figure out whether there’s anyone left in the financial world they can actually trust.

CREDENTIALS Being a Napfa member is not a credential. Napfa is a membership organization. There is a big difference, and I didn’t articulate it very well in my last column on this subject. Nor, frankly, had I sorted it out very well in my own head.

It’s not especially difficult to become one of Napfa’s 2,100 members. You must pay $475, submit a financial plan for peer review and meet some modest experience requirements.

You must also have a bachelor’s degree. Several readers criticized me last time for saying that I’d taken some comfort in Mr. Weitzman’s degrees.

Look, people who get M.B.A.’s from Columbia tend to know investments especially well, so that is a big part of what resonated with me. But I also recognize that there was a bit of unconscious snobbery at work, too. He reminded me a bit of me. And perhaps he counted on that happening, even though my wife and I were not among those clients of his firm who ultimately ended up losing any money.

Credentials, instead, are things like the certified financial planner designation, which requires those who have it to pass a difficult exam. A certified public accountant counts here, too, as does a chartered financial analyst. You can’t just pay to get these letters after you name; you have to earn them.

ASTERISKS A number of Napfa planners took offense at my assertion that it would be hard to mention the association again without including some kind of an asterisk.

So what if there are a few scofflaws? they said. Baseball has a problem. Some doctors commit malpractice. And quite a few readers pointed to New York Times journalists who have embarrassed the institution.

But these readers were missing the point. None of us can watch professional baseball without feeling just a little bit dirty. That’s a given. I, however, had given Napfa a free pass, taking its regular insistence on the highest commitment to integrity as evidence of every member’s purity. But Napfa membership doesn’t bestow knighthood or sainthood or anything like that. So I had been a bit naïve. That’s all I was trying to say.

SO NOW WHAT? I still believe that a Napfa planner should be among the first people you see when shopping for financial assistance. “So many good people in the organization have sweated blood to build a fiduciary culture in the midst of perhaps the most avaricious environment in the history of man,” Milo Benningfield, a financial planner, said in an e-mail message.

Even Mr. Putman, the subject of the S.E.C. action, has nothing but good things to say about the group. “Napfa is a great organization, and I have high regard for their efforts and all the hard work everyone has done,” he said.

As for the charges against him, his only comment was this: “I’d love to talk, but I can’t. I’ve been advised not to, no matter how much I’d love to.”

But has Napfa lost some of the moral standing that it once had? “Our standards are still the highest,” said the group’s current chairwoman, Diahann W. Lassus, of Lassus Wherley, which has offices in New Providence, N.J., and Bonita Springs, Fla. “The reality is that people are human. They make bad mistakes and bad choices.”

You can do a couple of things to lower the odds of bad apples damaging you personally. Planners don’t much like my notion of paying for their investment advice but then executing the trades yourself. But I still think it’s a good idea for many people. There are a few who work this way all the time, and others who may let you keep the reins on the account all to yourself.

Check the legitimacy of planners’ credentials, and ask them to sign a fiduciary oath, promising to act in your best interests at all times. And read every word of every account statement. If you see something, say something. You should never be confused by jargon, strange numbers or anything else on your statements.

Oddly, Napfa doesn’t seem to have much interest in calling an all-comers meeting about how to deal with the fallout from the accusations against its members. I volunteered to moderate one at the conference, but organization officials said there simply wasn’t room on the agenda.

No offense taken personally, though this does irritate some members. “You can’t put your head in the sand and act like it hasn’t happened,” said Michael Miller, a financial planner in Mansfield, Tex., who describes his practice as one rooted in Christian beliefs. “I don’t think they’re doing enough to address it. It floors me that they’re not responding in a big way.”

Mr. Miller chose to voice his displeasure by skipping this year’s conference, which is near . He’s also considering dropping his membership in the group altogether.

That seems a little extreme to me. Better, perhaps, to stay and fight. Sure, the organization could do with a bit more introspection, but it still has the best collection of financial advisers anywhere.
210 2009-06-06 To many analysts, the news that 345,000 jobs were lost last month offered another hint that the economy might be bottoming out. But those figures were not a good omen for investors worried about inflation, or for the government’s efforts to keep a lid on interest rates.

As the government detailed its latest assessment of the job market, interest rates on Treasury issues shot up, reaching their highest since mid-November. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 30/32, to 94 7/32, as investors edged away from buying government debt in the face of exploding federal deficits.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.83 percent, from 3.71 percent late Thursday, and was up from 3.46 percent a week ago.

The creep toward higher interest rates represents a return to normalcy in some ways and comes as investors flock to markets for corporate debt and junk bonds that they had all but abandoned at the height of the credit crisis.

But higher interest rates on Treasuries make it more expensive for the government to borrow trillions in new debt, and they also raise mortgage rates for home buyers, threatening the government’s efforts to keep borrowing costs low.

215 2009-06-07 Chess players, even the best ones, can use help in developing strategies. That is why top players often employ trainers, also known as seconds, particularly when preparing for a match or important tournament.

Players chosen as seconds usually have a variety of skills. Some are experts in openings, others are defensive specialists. Occasionally, they are even ex-champions.

In last year’s world championship match between Viswanathan Anand of India, the defending champion, and Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Anand had four seconds: Peter Heine-Nielsen of Denmark, Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan (former champion of the World Chess Federation), Radoslaw Wojtaszek of Poland and Surya Sekhar Ganguly of India. Anand won the match to retain the title.

In addition to being paid, working with top-level players can make the seconds better players. It certainly seems to have helped Ganguly. Late last month, he won the Asian Continental Open in the Philippines. The tournament was a qualifier for the World Cup, an important step on the road to the world championship.

After his victory, Ganguly told The Hindu newspaper, “Being Anand’s second gave me the chance to see how champions play and prepare at the highest level. That helped in reshaping my approach to chess.”

The key to Ganguly’s victory was his 10th-round defeat of Rogelio Antonio Jr. of the Philippines, who was leading the tournament at the time. In the game, Ganguly demonstrated patience, taking advantage of an error by his opponent to win a pawn. He nurtured that advantage through to the endgame.
216 2009-06-07 Re “A New Iran Overture, With Hot Dogs” (news article, June 2), which reports that our embassies and consulates abroad have been authorized to invite representatives of Tehran to their Fourth of July celebrations:

As the chargé d’affaires at our embassy in Tehran on July 4, 1979, and the host of the reception that day, I read this with special interest. That was the first official embassy event after the revolution in February. We saw it as an “overture” then, given the still tenuous American-Iranian relationship, with several ministers of the provisional Islamic regime accepting our invitation and, yes, attending.

Time, of course, quickly proved that “overture” to be singularly unproductive, with the hostage affair that followed in November and the 30 unrewarding years since.

We can only hope that this current “overture” will turn out better.
217 2009-06-07 The Obama administration has made a serious proposal to regulate derivatives — the multitrillion-dollar market in financial contracts that malfunctioned so disastrously last year. The plan goes further than many thought politically possible, especially in its call for federal oversight of all large derivatives dealers. But it does not go far enough.

Those dealers — including big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — trade derivatives mainly as one-to-one private contracts, largely without any regulation. The plan would allow regulators to impose rules on dealers and track their activities and presumably put a timely halt to abuses. But it does not demand the full transparency that would come from trading all derivatives on exchanges, like stocks.

Exchange trading allows the market as a whole — investors, economists, researchers — to see how derivatives are structured, priced and traded. Such knowledge is the best defense against speculative excesses.

The plan would require that derivatives that are deemed “standardized” — off-the-shelf contracts with mostly boilerplate language — be traded through a central clearinghouse or on an exchange. But the plan would also allow for “customized” derivatives — no one knows yet with certainty what the difference would be — to continue to be traded privately.

The danger of perpetuating a freewheeling market in customized derivatives is real. The decision to rope them off looks like a sop to the banks, which have fought against disclosure and transparency. They know that customers who rely on derivatives — including investment funds, major corporations and wealthy individuals — would likely pay less if they could compare prices.

The question now is whether Congress will try to improve the plan. Gretchen Morgenson and Don Van Natta Jr. reported in The Times last week on the banks’ post-meltdown lobbying efforts. Lawmakers are being pressed, and plied with contributions, to favor the lightest regulations and the largest loopholes.
218 2009-06-07 Although most students still come directly from high school, Mr. Cox says the ranks of older students leaving other careers for cosmetology are growing. Frank Schoeneman, chief executive of Empire Beauty Schools, says that at least half of Empire’s students have attended college but left because they felt it would not prepare them for jobs.

Angela O’Brien, a student at Empire Beauty School in Indianapolis, is a former operations director at a trucking company. When she was laid off last year — her company’s biggest customers were American automakers — she wanted to move into an industry that would provide long-term job security.

In terms of revenue, cosmetology is holding steady in this recession. “I saw that while the beauty industry was being affected by the downturn, it didn’t devastate it,” Ms. O’Brien said. “Everyone has to get their hair cut — they may spend less, but they will still get it cut.”

The profession’s flexibility also appealed to Ms. O’Brien, who has two children. Forty-six percent of cosmetologists are self-employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many of them work flexible schedules.

That will be a welcome change, said Ms. O’Brien, who used to work 60-hour weeks and was on call 24 hours a day. “I don’t want to feel guilty anymore when I go to a school play or take a family vacation,” she said.

Public perception of the industry has also changed. “The old stereotype that only kids that can’t get into college go to beauty school — that’s gone,” Mr. Cox said.

And some hair stylists, like John Frieda, and makeup artists, like Bobbi Brown, are now celebrities. That has helped to give the profession a cachet it didn’t have a generation ago, many people in the industry say.

Becoming a cosmetologist can take 10 to 18 months of training, and tuition can range from about $8,000 to $18,000, depending on the school and the program. Every state requires a certain number of practical study hours — from about 1,000 to 2,200 — before a student can take the licensing exam. Most beauty schools also require a high school diploma or G.E.D. Graduates can work at salons, spas or behind the scenes in theater, film and television.

Many graduates will work in spas — defined by the International Spa Association as businesses that offer at least two of three services: massage, skin care treatments and body treatments. Topango Segura, a student in the holistic health-care practitioner program at Bellus Academy, has already landed a job as a massage therapist in San Diego, although he won’t graduate until August.

There are some downsides to the profession. Hair stylists and colorists spend most of the day on their feet, which can cause varicose veins and back pain. They work with or around chemicals, and many experience carpal tunnel problems, Mr. Cox said.

Starting salaries are often low, about $8 to $14 an hour (including tips and commission), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Part-time and self-employed workers often lack health benefits.

Salons and spas generally pay a weekly base salary and a commission on products and services sold, said Cheryl Whitman, a beauty consultant and president of Beautiful Forever Aesthetic Business Consulting in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

Even though entry-level earnings are generally low in the industry, it is not unusual for more experienced hair stylists, colorists and estheticians to earn considerably higher salaries. Those at the top of their profession can make six figures, Ms. Whitman said.

Cosmetology can also be very gratifying, Ms. Lynch said: “You are taking care of people all day, people who come to you to make them feel better. And that makes people feel really good about what they do.”
219 2009-06-07 In “Carbon Offsets: A Small Price to Pay for Efficiency” (Economic View, May 31), Robert H. Frank wrote that “there is no reason that fraud should be harder to curb in carbon-offset markets than in other domains.”

Unfortunately, the very nature of offset markets provides a fundamental challenge that is not present in most markets. This is because offset markets, essentially, pay some companies for carbon they haven’t produced.

To measure the true level of carbon that is offset by a payment, we must know what the recipient would have done in the payment’s absence — whether, for example it would have reduced its pollution regardless of the payment.

Rather than measure what someone actually does, this requires, somehow, a measurement of a what-if scenario. This goes beyond the domain of measurement and into the realm of mind-reading, something that regulators haven’t been very successful at to date. James Bushnell

The writer is research director of the University of California Energy Institute.

The column used the hypothetical example of a New Yorker who worries about the fuel used to ship winter tomatoes from California — and the effect that this would have on global warming. To assuage his guilt, he could pay $10 for carbon offsets and have his fresh tomatoes.
220 2009-06-07 With the government forced to sell enormous quantities of bonds to finance its fiscal stimulus and financial rescue operations, Treasury yields have risen sharply since the beginning of the year, and prices, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted.

On Friday, the Labor Department’s monthly unemployment report, which showed that the nation’s job losses in May were much lower than anticipated, exacerbated this trend. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which started the year at 2.21 percent, closed on Friday at 3.83 percent, their highest level in many months.

The Barclays Capital U.S. 20+ Year Treasury Bond index dropped 22.94 percent this year through Thursday, compared with a gain of 33.72 percent in 2008. By contrast, the Barclays Capital high-yield corporate bond index, which dropped 26.16 percent in 2008, climbed 29.5 percent this year. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which lost 38.5 percent, is up 4.1 percent through Friday, and the Nasdaq composite, which fell 40.5 percent, is up 17.3 percent.

Amid gains like this, the turmoil in the Treasury market is glaring. Individual investors who bought Treasury securities and government bond funds last year to buffer their portfolios have seen the price of their holdings decline sharply (though the government guarantees the full value of Treasury bonds that are held to maturity).

Those losses shouldn’t have been entirely surprising, though. After gaining so much in value, Treasuries were bound to fall, many analysts warned, and fall they did.

The decline was caused by several factors, Dr. Kaufman said. These include anticipation of an economic recovery, the increasing supply of government debt, the mounting fiscal deficit, and skepticism about the Federal Reserve’s huge intervention. “The market is testing the Fed’s intentions and desires,” he said.

In testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, alluded to some of these issues. He said the government must “demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term,” even as it engages in short-term deficit spending on a gargantuan scale. But he did not say whether the Fed would increase its purchases of longer-term bonds and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to drive down yields.

Edward E. Yardeni, an economist who runs Yardeni Research in Great Neck, N.Y., said that while he forecasts an end to the recession in the second half of this year, he does not expect a strong recovery. Furthermore, he said long-term fiscal deficits were unlikely to be eliminated quickly.

These circumstances, he said, make it hard for a stock market rally to continue for long. “The stock market is starting to decouple from the economy,” he said.

Improvement in the credit markets has given the Fed some breathing room, Ms. Miller said. While Treasury yields have risen, the “spread,” or gap between Treasuries and other debt instruments, has narrowed sharply. That has occurred partly because of lessening risk aversion among investors, and partly because of increased liquidity in markets like municipal bonds. Although the mortgage market is a concern, she said, interest rates have declined, not risen, for most corporate borrowers.

AFTER the wild swings of last year and early 2009, many markets have been returning to more typical ranges in a process of “mean reversion,” said Timothy W. Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. His firm last week shifted its asset-allocation recommendation to the most aggressive rating for equities, a judgment that the stock market rally is very likely to continue.

But Dr. Kaufman foresees trouble ahead for stocks. It is “difficult to project a significant corporate profit recovery,” he said, and it is likely to become clear later in the year that another bout of fiscal stimulus is needed. The government bond market might rally, he said, “if the administration recognizes that the economic recovery is not as strong as projected.”

Meanwhile, he said, the stock market “does not want to deal with a subnormal economic expansion” and would weaken.

Asked how he would advise investors, he said that those in the stock market should limit themselves to companies with extremely strong balance sheets and market share. Unless a corporate bond investor is “in a position to do extraordinarily deep analysis,” he said, he would suggest avoiding anything that isn’t “very high quality.”
221 2009-06-07 Why does this happen? One could easily believe that people are a little slower to sell their homes than, say, their stocks. But years slower?

Several factors can explain the snail-like behavior of the real estate market. An important one is that sales of existing homes are mainly by people who are planning to buy other homes. So even if sellers think that home prices are in decline, most have no reason to hurry because they are not really leaving the market.

Furthermore, few homeowners consider exiting the housing market for purely speculative reasons. First, many owners don’t have a speculator’s sense of urgency. And they don’t like shifting from being owners to renters, a process entailing lifestyle changes that can take years to effect.

Among couples sharing a house, for example, any decision to sell and switch to a rental requires the assent of both partners. Even growing children, who may resent being shifted to another school district and placed in a rental apartment, are likely to have some veto power.

In fact, most decisions to exit the market in favor of renting are not market-timing moves. Instead, they reflect the growing pressures of economic necessity. This may involve foreclosure or just difficulty paying bills, or gradual changes in opinion about how to live in an economic downturn.

This dynamic helps to explain why, at a time of high unemployment, declines in home prices may be long-lasting and predictable.

Imagine a young couple now renting an apartment. A few years ago, they were toying with the idea of buying a house, but seeing unemployment all around them and the turmoil in the housing market, they have changed their thinking: they have decided to remain renters. They may not revisit that decision for some years. It is settled in their minds for now.

On the other hand, an elderly couple who during the boom were holding out against selling their home and moving to a continuing-care retirement community have decided that it’s finally the time to do so. It may take them a year or two to sort through a lifetime of belongings and prepare for the move, but they may never revisit their decision again.

As a result, we will have a seller and no buyer, and there will be that much less demand relative to supply — and one more reason that prices may continue to fall, or stagnate, in 2010 or 2011.

All of these people could be made to change their plans if a sharp improvement in the economy got their attention. The young couple could change their minds and decide to buy next year, and the elderly couple could decide to further postpone their selling. That would leave us with a buyer and no seller, providing an upward kick to the market price.

For this reason, not all economists agree that home price declines are really predictable. Ray Fair, my colleague at Yale, for one, warns that any trend up or down may suddenly be reversed if there is an economic “regime change” — a shift big enough to make people change their thinking.

But market changes that big don’t occur every day. And when they do, there is a coordination problem: people won’t all change their views about homeownership at once. Some will focus on recent price declines, which may seem to belie any improvement in the economy, reinforcing negative attitudes about the housing market.

Even if there is a quick end to the recession, the housing market’s poor performance may linger. After the last home price boom, which ended about the time of the 1990-91 recession, home prices did not start moving upward, even incrementally, until 1997.
222 2009-06-07 Gerald W. Scully, a sports economist who offered an early statistical argument that major league baseball players were being exploited by their teams, died on May 4 in San Diego. He was 67 and lived in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.

The cause was pancreatic cancer, his daughter Audra said.

Mr. Scully wrote on many economic issues, including the relationship between government spending and economic growth; he argued that the optimum size of government is about one-fifth the size of the economy as a whole. But he is best known for an article, “Pay and Performance in Major League Baseball,” which was published in The American Economic Review in December 1974, long before the economics of sport became a common field of scholarly inquiry.

The article described a method of determining the contribution of individual players to the performance of their teams, not only in the won-lost column but in the balance sheets. He used statistical measures like slugging percentage for hitters and the strikeout-to-walk ratio for pitchers and devised a complex formula for determining team revenue that involved a team’s won-lost percentage and the market characteristics of its home stadium, among other factors.

By his calculations, Mr. Scully wrote, Hank Aaron was worth $520,800 to the Atlanta Braves in 1968, and Sandy Koufax $725,000 to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1966, his final season. Aaron never earned more than $250,000 a season in his career, which ended in 1976, and Koufax was paid $130,000 in 1966.

“Even mediocre players contribute in excess of $200,000 to team revenues,” Mr. Scully wrote.

The article was significant in its use of sport to attack the economist’s conundrum of determining the value to a company of an individual’s work product. The standard major league player contract at the time included the reserve clause, which essentially restricted the market for a player’s services to a single team. In arguing that the clause amounted to economic exploitation of the players, Mr. Scully anticipated an arbitration decision the next year that considerably modified the reserve clause and opened baseball’s era of free agency.

Gerald William Scully was born in Manhattan on June 13, 1941. His father was a bank vice president and branch manager. After graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, Mr. Scully abandoned graduate studies in Chinese to pursue economics. He received a master’s degree from the New School for Social Research and a doctorate from Rutgers.
223 2009-06-07 Q. Anything in your background that, looking back, prepared you for the art of building a team?

A. The thing that prepared me the most — where the team was front and center — was theater, which I did a lot of growing up, in high school, during college, law school and even for a couple of years after law school. I would say that probably is the starkest lesson in how reliant you are on others, because you’re there in front of an audience. It’s all live, and everybody’s got to know their lines and know their cues and know their movement, and so you’re totally dependent on people doing that.

You could have your piece down, but if one person on the team doesn’t, you’re in trouble, and it’s embarrassing because people aren’t used to seeing errors in theater. Theater is seamless every night.

Q. How do you hire people?

A. The most important thing to me is, you want to see someone who has passion, who really gets excited about the world around them and has drive. I like people who are energized by what they’re working on. I’m comfortable with people who are passionate, comfortable with people who are ambitious for the organizations they work in, ambitious for the function that they are building a career in, and want to make a contribution.

Being comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty is a trait I look for, because those folks are pretty comfortable with diversity, and not knowing how people who have differences might react in a situation doesn’t unmoor them. They’re comfortable with it and may even like that. Those kinds of folks also, when they’re faced with ambiguity and uncertainty, they’ve got their wits about them, so they’re looking as much for the opportunity that’s inherent in that as they are for the risk.

Q. How do you find out if somebody is like that?

A. You ask them about the various experiences they have had, and you try to probe, “where were those circumstances where there wasn’t good direction, when it wasn’t clear how things would break?” How do they respond to those questions? What’s the narrative around how they thought and behaved in those environments?

Q. Are there things that, as a leader or manager, you’ve learned to do less of over time?

A. I’d say probably less word-smithing, less massaging of the work product, more thinking, more reflecting. And that’s hard, because I like to wordsmith. With my background in theater and the law, I like that kind of stuff, and I work on things past the point where it makes any difference.

Q. What are you word-smithing?

A. I’ll wordsmith press releases, wordsmith analyst reports, reports to the board. You can wordsmith internal employee memos and speeches. There are all kinds of things.

Q. Any thoughts on how language is used in the business world?

A. I think writing in the business world is more functional than elegant. I felt that way making the transition from law to business. Lawyers write much better. They spend a lot more time on it. In the business world, it’s less about how well you say it and more about how efficiently you say it.

I do think language is important in leadership, and it’s critically important in oral communication. It’s worth thinking about exactly how you’re going to say something. It’s important for focusing people. It’s important for inspiring them. It’s important for directing them. The more senior you are, the more important it is, because your voice is amplified.

I did think it was an interesting debate during the presidential Democratic primary, when they talked about Barack Obama and how being able to give a good speech was one thing, but getting things done was another. I think to get a lot of things done, you have to be able to give a good speech. So I thought that was a specious argument.

Q. Are there areas you’re trying to improve as a leader?

A. As I said, I really value the passion. As a senior leader, sometimes you’ve got to harness the passion. So, you’ve got to give other people the chance to speak, voice a point of view. Some people are passionate, but it manifests itself in a different way, and so they’re more reflective in conversation. And so, you’ve got to leave some space for them to fill.

Q. Do you find, looking back over the course of your career, there was a certain insight you had that put you on a different trajectory?

A. I went to Williams College. I went to Stanford Law School. And I loved them both. I was a strong student at Williams, which I needed to be to get into a school like Stanford. I got to Stanford, and it was clear that the level of brain power among my student peers had just stepped up several levels. It was clear to me pretty quickly that no matter how hard I worked, I was not going to do better than a lot of my peers, because things came quicker to them than they did to me. Even though that was not true at Williams, it was true at Stanford. But that was fine, and I was comfortable with that.

What I discovered when I started practicing law was that, even though others had more intellectual horsepower, people still listened to me. They cared about what I thought — my peers, and the people I worked for. And so, that was probably the insight that told me at some point I could have a leadership position, because people really seemed to care what I thought, and they listened to me.

Q. Was there a particularly good piece of advice somebody gave you about your career?

A. One of the guys I worked for very early on said: “As you think about career, it’s not about planning it. Things are too dynamic; there’s too much going on; there are too many things that’ll pop up, good and bad. It’s not about planning and career planning; it’s about preparation and building skills. And if you do that, then you’ll recover from the mishaps, and you’ll be able to take advantage of the opportunities.”

Q. What has surprised you the most about the top job?

A. I would say it’s how amplified everything that you say or do is. That was the case at every senior job. It’s even more true of this position. And so, you have to be very intentional about what you say and do. If you’re not, then something that was just thinking out loud, some thought you had, some “what if,” becomes a directive, even though 10 seconds later in your own mind you dismissed it.

Q. Let’s talk about time management. How do you do it?

A. I schedule and block the calendar to have downtime, because I do think that in senior leadership positions, one of your jobs is to reflect, and you have to schedule time to do that. I try to leave a few hours a week that are unscheduled.

Q. What would you like business schools to teach more of, or less of?

A. I didn’t go to business school; I went to law school. But my sense is the one thing law school does that business schools could do more of is provide you with social context, the broader context within which business operates. There are business-and-the-law kinds of courses, but sometimes they get pretty transactional.

I think it would be interesting for business school students to learn constitutional law and comparative law. I think the dialogue between the business community and the civic community is hampered by that gap. And it’s never been clearer in my mind than now, when you’ve got a constitutional law professor as president. There’s just a disconnect. People don’t get the worldview that he’s coming from. But I don’t think he gets the business side as much as he should, either. There is a framework he’s coming from, and it’s as much a foundation to how this country works as the free enterprise system is. You’ve got to reconcile the two.

A. I would tell them that they’re privileged, given the status that they have, the fact that they’ve been able to get a higher education. And with privilege comes obligations. I think one of the most important obligations is for them to provide leadership in whatever area they choose to dedicate their life to.

Provide leadership — that’s the price of the privilege they’ve been granted. So it’s about more than them. Certainly, there are things they want to accomplish, but they’ve got to make sure that those things have some payoff for others.
224 2009-06-07 FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — Steve Atieh had the honor, if that is what it can be called. He hit the first ball off the first tee on the final day of public play before Bethpage Black was closed in preparation for this month’s United States Open.

It was a dying hook swallowed by the rough.

Spending the night in a car, being awakened at 4:30 a.m. by a course supervisor, hitting no practice balls (the driving range was closed), then being watched by dozens of strangers is not the most relaxing way to start a round of golf. But that is the way it happens at Bethpage Black, where the earliest tee times are saved for those who arrive first, usually a day ahead of time.

Those who played the course last Sunday saw what the professionals will soon see.

“It was brutal,” Atieh, 25, said in a phone interview. He usually shoots in the 90s but was “not that embarrassed” by his 108.

He said: “You felt really good when the round ended. It was over, and you did it.”

Atieh played with his two brothers and a friend, Ryan Boland, all from Basking Ridge, N.J. They spent two nights at Bethpage, earning Sunday’s first tee time.

Mike Atieh, 28, carries a 7 handicap. He was happy shooting 93. His first tee shot went right, off the hospitality tents.
225 2009-06-07 Mr. Berlusconi has brushed this off, as he has all other claims of impropriety, as a campaign against him by left-wing magistrates and journalists. He says they want to discredit his center-right coalition ahead of this weekend’s elections for the European Parliament, which he is still expected to win.

While wildly off target in my case, the magistrate’s Bloomberg theory is not entirely crazy. Mr. Berlusconi last week suggested in an interview that The Times of London had published critical editorials about him because it is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose Sky is the largest player in the Italian cable television market after Mr. Berlusconi.

In Italy, this is seen as business as usual. The general understanding is that everyone uses the means at his disposal to fight his rivals.

The real issue here is that Italy is not a meritocracy. It is a highly evolved feudal society in which everyone is seen as — and inevitably is — the product of a system, or a patron.

During the postwar years, the American-backed Christian Democrats, Moscow-backed Communists and business-minded Socialists had their own networks of politicians, bankers, lawyers — and their own press organs. That corrupt patronage system collapsed with the end of the cold war and a huge bribery scandal.

Today, there is no ideology and no network; there is only Mr. Berlusconi, and you are either with him or against him. Compared to the old order, Mr. Berlusconi’s political class is seen as a modernizing force. Mr. Berlusconi’s rivals accuse him of being on the wrong side of the law, and he in turn accuses them of being on the wrong side of history. Those two things shouldn’t cancel each other out, but often do.

The members of the Italian left have been infighting since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and are so weak and ineffective today that some in this land of byzantine conspiracy theories believe that Mr. Berlusconi must be paying them off.

Italy is deeply confusing for Americans, who are steeped in notions of speaking truth to power and following the money, raised in the country of “Yes we can,” not “Sorry, Signora, that’s impossible.”

In the topsy-turvy logic of Italy, Mr. Berlusconi’s unrivalled grip on the public and private sectors and media outlets doesn’t make him seem compromised. Instead, his supporters see him as rich enough to be independent. As one working-class Roman told me not long ago, full of admiration, “he’s so rich, he didn’t even need to go into politics.”

In Italy, when journalists ask completely legitimate questions about the legal status and personal life of the leader of a Group of Eight country — or even when they ask why Italy doesn’t seem to care about the answers — they are inevitably accused of insulting the prime minister or of being the pawns of larger interests.

In Italy, the general assumption is that someone is guilty until proven innocent. Trials — in the press and in the courts — are more often about defending personal honor than establishing facts, which are easily manipulated.

Sometimes I wonder what Pope Benedict XVI, who has railed against the “dictatorship of relativism,” in which equating all beliefs leads to nihilism, would make of Italy. Here, information is used less to clarify than to obfuscate.

How else to interpret the barrage of wildly contradictory material that has emerged in the press in recent weeks about how Mr. Berlusconi met Noemi Letizia, whose 18th birthday party he attended in April — an act that so angered his long-estranged wife that in threatening divorce she became de facto opposition leader?

In the absence of a clear, coherent story, the only standard of evidence becomes personal loyalty.

Ms. Letizia said in an interview last week that she was upset that her new boyfriend had auditioned for the reality television show “Big Brother” without asking her permission.

In the reality show that is today’s Italy, Mr. Berlusconi is the clear winner. His rivals are doing little more than throwing tomatoes on stage. The actor is showing signs of fatigue, but the audience is glued to its seats. Après lui, le déluge.
226 2009-06-07 There is no record of the founding fathers ever eating hot dogs, no trace, for example, of mustard on the Declaration of Independence. But the hot dog has played a role in American foreign relations since at least June 1939, when the king and queen of England attended a picnic at President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s estate in Hyde Park, N.Y., while soliciting American support for England in the war about to consume Europe.

The next day, a front-page headline in The New York Times shared the news:

KING TRIES HOT DOG 

AND ASKS FOR MORE

And He Drinks Beer With Them

Bob Clark, the head archivist at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library, in Hyde Park, agreed on Friday to dig deeper into this seminal event. “Anything we can do to further the diplomacy of the United States,” he said.

He called back to report that: a sample tray of hot dogs was served on a silver tray; the royal guests nevertheless joined everyone else in eating off paper plates; King George VI ate two hot dogs (“with gusto,” the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. later said); and the brand of hot dog was Swift.

A more delicate diplomatic matter concerned Queen Elizabeth. According to “The Roosevelts and the Royals,” a 2004 book by Will Swift, the queen turned to President Roosevelt and asked: “How do you eat it?”

He is said to have answered: “Very simple. Push it into your mouth and keep pushing it until it is all gone.”

But the Queen of England could not conjure her inner Ebbets Field bleacher bum. She is said to have used a knife and fork.

Twenty years later, in 1959, a hot dog again figured in American foreign relations when Nikita Khrushchev, the unpredictable leader of the Soviet Union, toured the United States. At one point he stopped at a packing plant in Des Moines, where he ate his first hot dog — although at least one account says his first bite had to wait until security agents waved a Geiger counter over the dog. A mere cold war formality.

The hot dog, it seems, figures in American diplomacy only when absolutely needed. In 1999, for example, President Bill Clinton gathered at a table with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to eat hot dogs. Kosher, of course.

Now it is needed again — on Independence Day, to help the Obama administration with the delicate matter of Iran. And if things do not go as well as planned, the administration might consider contacting the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, a project of the American Meat Institute and conveniently located in Washington.

Its officials can suggest recipes beyond the traditional dog in a bun. Perhaps the crisis at hand might call for “grilled hot dog and fruit kabobs,” or maybe something more traditional, like “franks and beans.”

The council also has a cheeky list of etiquette tips that could come in handy for foreign heads of state. Among them: use paper napkins, not cloth napkins, when wiping one’s mouth while eating a hot dog; take no more than five bites in consuming a hot dog; and never, ever, use utensils to eat a hot dog on a bun.

One more thing, Your Majesty. Wanna beer?
227 2009-06-07 When cousins in the United States sent him videos of N.B.A. games, Bryant studied the feet of Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.

“I’ve always worked on it, always worked on it since I was a kid,” Bryant said. “I just watched different players — Olajuwon, Michael, Charles — and just all kinds of footwork and just tried to emulate them. Playing soccer, I think, had a lot to do with it as well. It’s just growing up overseas.”

Eventually, Bryant teamed with Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, who used to have other great jab steppers. When Jackson coached the Chicago Bulls, he walked into the team’s training center one day and found Scottie Pippen tutoring Jordan on a corner sequence. “Because Scottie could make the footwork and dunk with his left hand, and Michael always envied that,” Jackson said.

Jackson also appreciated the value of other sports. Before the draft, he used to ask prospects about their athletic experiences.

“Basketball is a very skilled sport,” Jackson said. “But we need guys that can throw the basketball like a baseball and we like guys that have footwork like in soccer.”

As Bryant’s game advanced, his appetite for watching film grew. He seldom goes anywhere without a DVD player so he can study highlights and the tendencies of opponents.

“There’s some things that we’ve always worked with him on, particularly where he gets his shots from and how he got his shots,” Jackson said. “Footwork has always been something he’s worked at on his own.”

In Game 1 of the finals Thursday night, Lee and Mickael Pietrus were mostly helpless bystanders against Bryant, who put on a clinic of sound fundamentals in the Lakers’ 100-75 victory over the Magic. Bryant scored 40 points, his most in a finals game, many of them by freeing himself for midrange jump shots.

“He has great footwork; he has great body control,” said Pietrus, who guarded LeBron James in the Eastern Conference finals only to have his hands full again with Bryant. “He has great everything. Compared to LeBron, he’s very different because he’s moving a lot and he knows how to get you unbalanced to make his shot. He’s Kobe Bryant, so I’m not surprised.”

Although Bryant and Jordan were originally known for their high-flying theatrics, many contend that as their careers advanced, their footwork helped maintain the quality of their game.

“All good players have the same DNA in that regards,” said the Lakers assistant Jim Cleamons, who had the same role with Jordan’s Bulls. “If you’re going to start building a foundation, footwork is part of it. It’s part of being athletic. Michael, I would throw right up there at the top with anybody I’ve ever been associated with. Same with Kobe”

“Just depends on what he’s doing and what I feel,” he said. “I just react instinctively.”

Defenders also have to deal with other parts of Bryant’s game.

“It’s his mind frame,” Battier said. “That’s what sets him apart. There are guys with, I wouldn’t say equal skill, but there are really skilled guys. What sets him apart is his relentlessness. He never quits. Never quits. That’s his biggest strength.”

Before pausing, Battier added: “Got pretty good footwork, too. He doesn’t give you much.”
228 2009-06-07 Emily Lynn Lewandowski and Dr. James Merriman Hildebrand were married Saturday The bridegroom’s mother, the Rev. Alice A. Hildebrand of Deer Isle, Me., a minister of the United Church of Christ, performed the ceremony at First Congregational Church in Blue Hill, Me.

Mrs. Hildebrand, 29, recently completed her second year of study in the master’s degree program in architecture at Boston Architectural College. She is also a project assistant in the Somerville, Mass., office of Mashek MacLean Architects in Vineyard Haven, Mass.

She is the daughter of Maryanne Lewandowski and Stephen M. Lewandowski, also of Deer Isle. Her father is a nurse anesthetist at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Me. Her mother is a sixth-grade teacher at Blue Hill Consolidated School.

Dr. Hildebrand, 29, received his medical degree from the University of Rochester last month, and in July is to become an intern in the emergency medicine residency program at University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester. He graduated from Vassar.

His mother is the pastor of both the First Congregational Church of Deer Isle and Sunset Congregational Church, also in Deer Isle. His stepfather, the Rev. Allen C. Myers of Deer Isle, is pastor of the West Brooksville Congregational Church in Brooksville, Me. Mr. Myers is also an instructor of geology and marine science at the University College in Ellsworth, Me., which is part of the University of Maine.
229 2009-06-07 But the only 23-year-old Russian with strong ties to Spain who did a respectable impression of Graf in this final was Kuznetsova, the No. 7 seed. Her 6-4, 6-2 victory required just 1 hour 13 minutes and generated precious little suspense down the stretch.

“I’ve been waiting for this moment for a very long time,” Kuznetsova said.

Physicists may quibble over what a very long time truly represents, but the road to victory here surely must have seemed long to Kuznetsova. She is a powerhouse of an athlete with a complete set of tennis skills and a clay-court slide worthy of a Spaniard, which is essentially what she was for a decade after leaving her home city, St. Petersburg, for Barcelona in her early teens.

It is the mental game that has been her downfall, but the mental game was only an intractable problem for one woman Saturday. “I just didn’t handle it,” Safina said of the pressure.

Kuznetsova, who had lost four of her last five matches against Safina, rose to prominence as Martina Navratilova’s young, handpicked doubles partner. She won the 2004 United States Open in singles at 19 and rose to a career high of No. 2 in the rankings in 2007. But for all her abundant talent, she has not been able, until now, to produce another big tennis bang.

She lost in the final at Roland Garros in 2006 against Justine Henin and was beaten again by Henin in the final of the 2007 United States Open. Last season fizzled with a series of close losses, and Kuznetsova said she even talked about quitting tennis.

“I said it,” she said. “I never felt it.”

But she said she was re-energized by moving her training base to Moscow from Spain late last year, a move reinforced by a conversation at the 2008 Olympics with Roger Federer.

Kuznetsova, concerned about the possible distractions of being back among family and Russian friends, said Federer told her: “Look, you can only depend on yourself. You can control it. If you can concentrate and live in Moscow, do this. If you cannot, only you can judge.”

Of Federer’s advice, Kuznetsova said, “For me, it was big.” She has since shuffled her support team with an emphasis on a low-pressure approach and has hired Larisa Savchenko, a former top-20 player from Latvia, to coach her this spring.

Now, with plenty of help from the edgy and ultimately distraught Safina, Kuznetsova can no longer be accused of being a one-Slam wonder. She has felt star-crossed at times in Paris. In 2004, she lost in the fourth round after holding two match points against the eventual champion, Anastasia Myskina of Russia. The next year in the same round, she had two more match points against Henin, who also went on to win the title.

Kuznetsova started tentatively on this cool, overcast day, rare weather in a tournament that had been flooded with sunlight for much of the last week. Kuznetsova lost the opening game on her serve, but she quickly recovered and reeled off the next eight points to take a 2-1 lead. The two women, who have been playing each other since they were juniors in Russia, then settled into an intense, high-velocity rhythm.

It was a promising spectacle, but it devolved into another dud of a women’s final in Paris, where the last final that stretched to three sets was in 2001, when Jennifer Capriati beat Kim Clijsters. But this mismatch was no fault of Kuznetsova’s. She played generally smooth-flowing, clear-headed tennis, looking much more at ease in the forecourt than the taller, more mechanical Safina.

Kuznetsova did not handle her first major opportunity, losing a game at love when she served for the opening set at 5-3. But in the next game, Kuznetsova lifted her performance again, coming up with two forehand winners and tracking down a backhand drop shot from Safina to produce a sliding angle winner of her own.

She won the set, then secured the match by sweeping the final four games of the second set, with Safina making unforced errors in bunches and looking imploringly in the direction of her coach, Zeljko Krajan, in the stands.

After double-faulting to lose the title, Safina stood on the baseline, put a hand to her head and then sent her racket smashing to the clay, releasing it as it hit the ground and then making her way slowly to the net to exchange a kiss on each cheek with Kuznetsova, who kept her celebration respectfully subdued. She knows Safina well and is also close with her older brother, Marat Safin, a former United States Open and Australian Open champion. Safin, who sent a congratulatory text message to Kuznetsova on Saturday, remains, for now, the only member of his family to win a major singles title. “I don’t think she has pressure because of him,” Kuznetsova said of Safina.

Safina said it came from within and she was soon hunched forward on her chair at courtside, with a faraway look in her eyes and her heart-shaped face resting on her chin: a pose better suited to a Rodin sculpture garden than Roland Garros.
230 2009-06-07 Dr. Emily Alexandra Gordon and Daniel Justin Percella were married Saturday at Highlawn Pavilion, a restaurant in West Orange, N.J. The Rev. Dr. David M. Price, a retired Presbyterian minister, officiated.

Dr. Gordon, 26, is keeping her name. She graduated from Cornell and received her medical degree from the Newark campus of University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. This month she is to begin an internship in internal medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.

She is the daughter of Fredda Gordon and Robert Gordon of Manhattan, where both are psychotherapists in private practice.

Mr. Percella, 28, is a stock analyst at JPMorgan Chase in Manhattan. He graduated from Georgetown and is a chartered financial analyst.

He is a son of Diane Percella and Daniel L. Percella of Bayonne, N.J. The bridegroom’s mother is an administrative assistant at Bayonne High School. His father works in Hoboken, N.J., as the treasurer for Mercer, a consulting unit of Marsh & McLennan.
231 2009-06-07 With the recession in its 18th month and unemployment now topping 9 percent, even semi-conspicuous consumption is a distant memory. Consumers are hunkered down. But when they do venture out, chances are they’re on their way to places like Wal-Mart and other big discount chains.

“Our sales — it’s like holding up a mirror to our society,” said John E. Fleming, the chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer.

So what are Wal-Mart, with 4,100 stores across the country, and other major retailers seeing?

Less browsing in the aisles, for one thing. Consumers now are “very disciplined in terms of making sure that they don’t go beyond what they have on their lists,” Kathryn A. Tesija, Target’s executive vice president of merchandising, told investors recently.

Food, of course, is high on those lists (discretionary items like clothes and furniture are not). But consumers are cracking their wallets only so far. Many are trading down to private label groceries. At Wal-Mart, sales of refrigerated pizza were up last month compared with a year ago. Lower grades of meat are outselling the higher-grade, pricier cuts. A recession protein hierarchy has emerged, with ground beef trumping steak, and chicken trumping beef. Some consumers are forgoing protein altogether, opting for pasta.

“We’re seeing a movement away from protein into carbohydrates,” Mr. Fleming said. “It stretches the dollar a lot further.”
232 2009-06-07 Svetlana Kuznetsova had waited nearly five years to win her second major tennis championship. She had slogged through three-set matches fraught with anxiety during this 2009 French Open tournament.

But on Saturday morning in Paris, Kuznetsova made short work of the women’s final against her fellow Russian opponent, Dinara Safina. She needed only 74 minutes to breeze through what was to be the hardest match yet, upending the top-seeded Safina with a 6-4, 6-2 victory.

“I have been waiting for this moment for a long time, losing to the winners,” Kuznetsova, a 23-year-old from St. Petersburg, said in her bubbly English on Philippe Chatrier court when accepting the trophy. “I had been playing many matches, and this time it happened. Really, I didn’t expect it to happen this year,”

At age 19, Kuznetsova had captured the 2004 U.S. Open championship, also over another fellow Russian player, Elena Dementieva. But she had twice finished as a runner-up in major tournaments, and had been known for squandering big leads.

This match had none of Kuznetsova’s trademark drama where she would seem to be in control only to fall behind, and then overcome her opponent again — as she did in the three-set marathon quarterfinal match against Serena Williams earlier this week.

Kuznetsova lost her serve on the first game of this match, but from there never lost her composure or control.
233 2009-06-07 The croissants at the Flaky Tart in Atlantic Highlands are as they should be, airy and flaky. Perhaps that’s why the shop’s owner, Marie Jackson, was a semifinalist both this year and last in the Outstanding Pastry Chef category of the James Beard Foundation awards.

“I try not to do anything over the top, but I do want it to be the best,” said Ms. Jackson, 44, who opened her Parisian-style patisserie in 2007.

In addition to French pastries, the baked goods include chocolate chip cookies ($7.50 for a bag of 10) that are pure buttery bliss. Ms. Jackson, who studied at the Restaurant School in New York City, also makes old-fashioned butter-cream cupcakes ($2), densely rich brownies ($4.25) and minitarts from puff pastry, almond cream and fruit ($3.75).

The macaroon chocolate kiss — a coconut confection topped with chocolate ganache and dipped in dark chocolate ($1.50) — is beloved, as are many other goods brought to the marble counter fresh from the kitchen throughout the day.

If you want to get your hands on a ham-and-Gruyère croissant ($3.25), come first thing in the morning; this hot breakfast sandwich sells out fast. You can eat it warm at the counter (there are nine seats).

The macaroni and cheese, with a creamy mix of cheeses topped with bread crumbs made from baguettes ($6), is equally popular. A lunch entree, it is usually ready by 11 a.m., but Ms. Jackson makes only one tray and on some days it is gone in half an hour. Fortunately, there are also some salads and sandwiches (choices change daily). And you can always just order dessert.

Flaky Tart, 145 First Avenue, Atlantic Highlands; (732) 291-2555. Open Tuesday to Friday, 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
234 2009-06-07 DAIKO Japanese Restaurant & Jerry-San’s Sushi Bar in West Haven is practically an institution in the New Haven area. In part, its reputation is due to the quality of the seafood, which is very good, particularly for Connecticut. It also benefits from the outgoing nature of its owner and sushi chef, Jerry Ting (known to his clients as Jerry-San), who holds court at the sushi bar, waving hello to regular customers as they pass through the door, and joking with the folks at the bar.

In October of last year, Mr. Ting opened a second restaurant — Jerry-San’s Sushi Bar II & Asian Cuisine — in the Savin Rock area of West Haven, a waterfront neighborhood known for its beaches and fried-seafood restaurants, like Chick’s and Jimmies. When I visited the new place this month, Mr. Ting, who splits his time between locations, was working at Daiko. I missed his artistry, but even without him, Jerry-San’s served solid fare.

The new spot is pretty — bright, light and cheerful, with one long wall painted a glorious shade of blue. The menu is substantially the same as at Daiko, combining sushi bar selections with a variety of cooked appetizers and entrees, including Thai stir-fry and noodle dishes. The seafood selection is pretty much the same at both restaurants (Daiko offers a few more options), but the prices at the new restaurant are 25 to 50 cents less per item.

Of the appetizers, I liked a special of wasabi shumai, bite-size dumplings stuffed with shrimp and sharp with wasabi. Fried pork gyoza were nicely browned, the delicate wrapping thin, light and crisp. And Jerry-San’s serves a respectable version of tako su, a salad of sliced octopus mixed with shreds of seaweed and served in a vinegar broth.

Since I had tried very few sushi rolls at Daiko, I wanted to try some here and chose most of our table’s entrees from the sushi bar menu.
235 2009-06-07 WITH orchestral commissions hard to come by, few composers are likely to look a gift horse in the mouth. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be taken aback. “They were pretty much the last people I expected to approach me for a commission,” Missy Mazzoli said of a recent request from the League of Composers/International Society for Contemporary Music that she create a work for its 2010-11 concert season.

For one thing, the league’s orchestra, for which the piece was requested, has yet to make its debut. For another, its venerable parent — the League of Composers, founded in New York in 1923 — has in recent decades favored the descendants of 12-tone masters, disciples like the honorary co-chairmen of its advisory board, Milton Babbitt and Elliott Carter. In spirit it’s a world apart from the experimental arts scene that includes Ms. Mazzoli, 28, who writes post-Minimalist, rock-inspired music, and Jason Treuting, 32, another genre-bending composer and a member of the quartet So Percussion, who has also been offered an orchestral commission.

The Orchestra of the League of Composers/I.S.C.M. (as it is known everywhere) will first perform on Wednesday, conducted by Louis Karchin at the Miller Theater. At a time when other arts organizations are struggling to stay afloat and in many cases curtailing their activities, starting an orchestra and handing out commissions may seem counterintuitive, if not perilous. But these bold endeavors show an old, established organization undergoing profound changes to ensure a viable future.

At its origins, the League of Composers joined a handful of post-World War I new-music organizations striving to establish New York as an international cultural capital. Led by the arts patron Claire Reis, it sponsored premieres of works by Schoenberg, Bartok and Barber as well as the American premiere of Stravinsky’s “Sacre du Printemps.” It commissioned American composers, like Aaron Copland, Roy Harris and Roger Sessions, and formed partnerships with major orchestras so that their pieces would be heard. It also harnessed a new medium, radio, with its broadcasts in the NBC Music Guild Series.

After the league merged with the United States branch of the I.S.C.M. in 1954, it began to serve in an administrative capacity, submitting American entries for the annual I.S.C.M. World Music Days. Its concerts continued with various programs of chamber music, formalized with the creation of its Chamber Players in 1983, but the number dwindled in recent years. The league has lately been valued perhaps more for its past than its future potential.

The leadership responsible for suddenly extending a hand to a younger generation is new. David Gordon, a 39-year-old composer, became president of the league in 2007 after getting the board to approve a detailed, strategic plan centering on the orchestra and the commissions.
236 2009-06-07 ANTWERP has been a byword for avant-garde fashion since a group of up-and-coming designers started working in the Flemish city in the 1980s.

The city’s historic core is now one of Europe’s hottest fashion hubs, and the price tags verify that status. Try walking into Dries Van Noten’s Het Modepaleis (Nationalestraat 16; 32-3-470-2510; www.driesvannoten.be) for some new apparel. A woman’s top can set you back 800 euros ($1,136 at $1.42 to the euro). A dress can easily run over 1,000.

But if you can’t afford those price tags, equally fashionable outfits can be found in the city’s booming second-hand clothing scene.

These outlets are the best way to add big-name designers from Antwerp and beyond to your wardrobe at bargain rates, while ambling through some of the city’s historic neighborhoods.

In 2007, FCS (Timmerwerfstraat 8; 32-3-294-3378; www.fcselection.be) moved to Zuid (South), a honeycomb of small industrial streets and mixed-architecture riverside avenues, considered Antwerp’s trendiest neighborhood. The store is a second-hand beacon in Antwerp, the first shop of its kind to sell both clothes and interior design items.
237 2009-06-07 CRAIG BRAMSCHER is betting that there are thousands of motorcycle riders eager to buy zero-emissions bikes. He ought to hope that his potential customers are as prosperous as they are environmentally conscious.

Mr. Bramscher’s latest creation, the Brammo Enertia, an 18-horsepower electric motorcycle with a top speed of 55 miles an hour, will make its public debut in New York on June 9. The 280-pound Enertia is available for preorder at $11,995 — that’s $4 less than a Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide — though the electric motorcycle is eligible for a 10 percent federal tax credit.

When Enertia deliveries begin in early July — they will be sold through Best Buy — new owners can fill up for pennies per charge rather than dollars per gallon. The motorcycle’s on-board charger can plug into a standard 110-volt outlet and recharge the lithium-ion batteries in less than four hours. Some of the Enertia’s components are made entirely of materials that began life as pop bottles and carpets, while the body panels are created from a mixed percentage of recycled and new materials.

Unlike many proposed electric vehicles, the Enertia comes from a company with some experience. Mr. Bramscher knew, even as his company was building the open-frame Ariel Atom sports car in 2002, that he wanted to go electric. He even looked into making an electric version of the Atom, but could not strike a royalty agreement with the car’s designer.

Mr. Bramscher contemplated a competitor for the Tesla Roadster, but determined it would take a half-billion-dollar investment to engineer and build an electric car. And there was a bigger challenge: while the promise of fast charging was (and still is) on the horizon, electric cars were not yet affordable for the average commuter.
238 2009-06-07 The voice of Oumou Sangare is a beacon — incandescent, steadfast and reassuring — throughout “Seya” (World Circuit/Nonesuch), her intensely spirited fifth album. Singing in the Wassoulou style of southern Mali, awake with fluttering digressions, she strikes a tone of moral authority and audacious uplift. Her accompaniment, a small army of musicians marshaled by the arranger-producer Cheikh Tidiane Seck, adds bright bustle without obscuring the purpose of the songs, which revisit poignant themes. “Sounsoumba” and “Wele Wele Wintou” advocate women’s rights and the end of preadolescent forced marriages. Elsewhere Ms. Sangare tackles immigration, encourages societal respect and, with joy and reverence, invokes the names of her musical forebears. Her most personal declarations might also be the most effortlessly scrupulous: when she sings about her own extravagant success, on the title track and a song called “Kounadya,” she’s presenting herself as an approachable ideal, something made possible in this world.

Mali also looms large in the music of Oran Etkin, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist making his debut with “Kelenia” (Motéma). But it comes projected through a notably different lens: Mr. Etkin, now based in Brooklyn, was born and raised in Israel. His version of a Malian jazz hybrid includes traces of Middle Eastern modality as well as ebullient swing rhythm. It doesn’t feel like the work of a dilettante, partly because Mr. Etkin puts such obvious effort into the act of cultural translation. It helps too that two of his regular partners — Balla Kouyaté, a balafon ace, and Makane Kouyate, a percussionist and vocalist (they aren’t related) — hail from Mali, along with one of the album’s guests, the well-known griot Abdoulaye Diabaté. Even on an Africanized version of Duke Ellington’s “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” Mr. Etkin has no trouble keeping his stylistic bearings. (He’ll play Friday at Barbès; barbesbrooklyn.com.)

“Monoliths & Dimensions” is exactly the right title for the new album from this drone-metal band, released a few weeks ago on Southern Lord. The scale of the album is tectonic, with each of its four movements suggesting a kind of epochal change. When there are lyrics, articulated with guttural care by the Hungarian black-metal vocalist Attila Csihar, they align the subconscious with the cosmic: “Thunderous resonant sounds call from beyond the depths,” goes the first line from “Aghartha.” (Another track includes this romantic couplet: “I got you in my sublimes of dreams/Where asteroids explode.”) But words are secondary for Sunn O))), a k a Greg Anderson on bass and Stephen O’Malley on guitar, who long ago made thunderous resonant sounds their stock in trade. What’s striking about this new release is its wealth of additional textures: woodwinds, brass, strings, male and female choirs. It all concludes with a pastoral solo from the jazz trombonist Julian Priester, who sounds secure in this setting, almost serene.

The tension between structure and spontaneity has long been a core preoccupation for this expressly future-minded alto saxophonist and composer. “Travail, Transformation and Flow” (Pi), due out on Tuesday, takes that tension to heady extremes. Mr. Lehman composed most of the music on the album with clinical attention to frequency and overtone: his harmonies were devised with the help of spectrum analysis and programming software. So in one sense this is computer music, though it’s also the product of a nimbly improvising octet. (On Monday the group will play at Le Poisson Rouge; lepoissonrouge.com.) Some of the album’s eight tracks — notably “Alloy,” the longest and most immediately gripping — summon the ghosts of a knockabout post-bop avant-garde. Others, like “Echoes,” suggest the tolling of temple bells as remixed by a dance-music collagist. And Mr. Lehman closes with a meaningful nod, covering “Living in the World Today” by GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. It’s a perfectly ultramodern gesture, and the swagger fits.

“Tonight: Franz Ferdinand” (Domino/Epic), released in January, charted a slightly new course for this modish Glaswegian post-punk band: fewer razor’s-edge guitar riffs, more booming bass and bobbing grooves. Produced by a Londoner, Dan Carey, it reflected the influence of dub reggae, though only to a faint degree. So “Blood” (Domino), a collection of Mr. Carey’s dub remixes of the same material, can be seen as the logical extension of an idea. Most of its tracks employ the usual modifications: a distant-sounding vocal mix, a murkier sonic palette, stark differences in color and mood. “Feeling Kind of Anxious,” which is based on “Ulysses,” the lead single from “Tonight,” gets its message across with throbbing electronics and a gradual buildup. “Feel the Pressure” rides the same tempo as “What She Came For,” but with gummier atmosphere. Less fun are the remakes of “Twilight Omens” (too robotic) and “Turn It On” (too smudged). But “Feel the Envy,” with its echo-heavy groove, seriously improves on “Send Him Away.” When Alex Kapranos, the lead singer, materializes to sing his first line — “I can’t seem to feel the envy I should feel” — he sounds credibly numb.
239 2009-06-07 Accepting the Democratic nomination in a huge football stadium way back in the presidential campaign of ’08, Senator Barack Obama displayed his oratorical talent by using one of his favorite tried-and-true devices in argument: “Don’t tell me that Democrats won’t defend this country!”

Who was telling him that? To be sure, his opponents were claiming that a Republican administration would be stronger on defense, but nobody was telling him or the voters that Democrats preferred abject surrender. At the time, reviewing that speech, I noted the rhetorical technique: “By escalating criticism, he knocked down a straw man, the oldest speechifying trick in the book.”

Encouraged by his reviews for eloquence, President Obama has embraced the straw man frequently (as F.D.R. liked to emphasize it, “again and again and again”) with nary a peep of criticism. Two weeks ago, the Times correspondent Helene Cooper dared to note this president’s repeated use of digs like “I know some folks in Washington and on Wall Street are saying we should just focus on their problems.” Some folks, like those who, are never named but are always wrongheaded extremists. Her “White House Memo” was headlined “Some Obama Enemies Are Made Totally of Straw”; its subhead was “Setting them up to have someone to knock down.” Cooper, as the objective reporter, gave examples of conservative politicians who speak straw-manese, although none with such fluency.

I’ve had experience in this form of rhetorical attack as analyst, as victim and as perpetrator. President Bill Clinton told a foreign-policy audience in 1995 that “the new isolationists would have us face the future alone.” I wondered in print: Who were those nuts proposing “America — let’s face the future alone”?

The same year, when the Serbs were imposing “ethnic cleansing” on the Muslims in Bosnia and the world was wringing its hands, op-ed columnists urged the supply of arms and NATO air support to the besieged Bosnians in their homeland. Gen. Colin Powell told The New Yorker: “William Safire and Tony Lewis say this will only take a little bit of bombing and it will work . . . and Safire . . . just says, ‘Air power can do it.’ Forget it.” Rather than whine about his misrepresentation of my position, I counterattacked: “That’s the straw-man trick: Take your opponent’s argument to a ridiculous extreme and then attack the extreme.” (U.S. air power helped force the Serbs out and also led to today’s independent Kosovo.)
240 2009-06-07 From Greene Hill, Feuer went to teach a prenatal class elsewhere in Brooklyn; she teaches in Manhattan too, and sometimes she crosses back and forth between the boroughs two or three times a day to get to her web of workplaces. “I spend a lot of time on the train,” she said on the subway to Greene Hill, “and it makes you wonder: If you had a regular job and you didn’t have all that travel time, would you make better money in the end?” She gave a small laugh. “But I love what I do. So I try not to think about that.”

The thought is increasingly hard to push away, however. Last summer, the gym that paid Feuer best closed. In January, the two weekly after-school classes she offered at a Brooklyn public school failed to fill and were canceled. Feuer’s prenatal and mommy-baby students tend to move on, and the new mothers were no longer asking for one-on-one sessions.

Feuer’s ex-husband pays one-third of her rent, and she had been counting on the money from the after-school classes to pay her share for July and August. “I don’t know how I will make it through the summer,” she said in an e-mail message. The bottom of the note read, “Sent from my iPhone.” The call of semidesperation via a high-tech status symbol is an emblem of the gap between the past and the present for many of urban America’s self-employed. Freelancers still have the trappings of middle-class entrepreneurship. But the downturn is eating away at their livelihoods and the identity they thought they chose when they decided to work for themselves.

Especially in personal services, the freelance economy of New York and other big cities is stumbling along with the national economy. Yoga teachers, private tutors, gym trainers, massage therapists, drivers, personal chefs — they all count on high hourly earnings, private sessions and tips from wealthy clients. When cities were flush, the clients rolled in and the perks of self-employment — freedom, flexibility, entrepreneurship — seemed to outweigh more traditional benefits like job security and health insurance.

“The main chance is becoming a free agent in an economy of free agents,” the business guru Tom Peters wrote in the magazine Fast Company in 1997. Liberate yourself from the confines of an office. Be your own boss. Be your own brand. “You create a message and a strategy to promote the brand called You,” Peters wrote.

An increasing number of people followed such calls to the logical end of self-employment in the decade before the recession. Nationally between 1995 and 2005, the number of self-employed independent contractors grew by 27 percent, to almost nine million workers. The category includes freelance workers and consultants — people who tell the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that they obtain work on their own but don’t own a business like a restaurant or a shop. New York City has more than its share of the self-employed: 720,000 in 2004, representing 16 percent of the city’s work force, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The city’s self-employed include lifelong artists, like Feuer, and also former coat-and-tie workers. “I totally feel like I got caught up in the zeitgeist of the ’90s,” says Ed Antoine, who is 47 and has an engineering degree from Princeton. After a decade of engineering and other jobs, he spent 10 years writing software code for banks like Morgan Stanley and software-consulting firms. “It’s almost a cliché that after 10 years no one wants to write another line of code,” he says. Beginning in college, Antoine started teaching SAT prep courses on the weekends; later, he continued to teach on the side. One day, after he left one programming job and was looking for another, he got a call from a woman he had never met. “She said, ‘My daughter has a friend who took your SAT class three years ago, and we made four phone calls to track you down: will you tutor my daughter?’ I thought, you know, I could catch this entrepreneurial dream. I could tutor for a living.”

As laid-off workers look for other ways to make money in a downturn, the ranks of the self-employed tend to increase. This means more competition among tutors and yoga teachers and trainers even as demand falls for personal services. “When people had a lot of money and not much time, they were more willing to pay for home-fitness instructors, private tutors, personal chefs,” says David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies long-term changes in wages and economic inequality. Elizabeth Gold, a 34-year-old tutor and freelance writer, put it this way, “When the recession started, I went down the list of people I know and realized almost all of us were employed because of the boom of riches in the city in the last few years.”

Even in her best years, Feuer was never affluent, but with child support she was able to live what she considered a middle-class life. This year, however, because of the classes and students she has lost, Feuer is on track to make as little as $15,000, a 30 percent drop from the past. But because she is underemployed rather than out of work, she is not eligible for unemployment insurance. She also doesn’t show up in the unemployment statistics.

A different set of numbers, however, suggests that the effect of the recession on freelance workers is widespread. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks the number of self-employed workers who say they are working “part time for economic reasons,” which means that they work fewer than 35 hours a week because they can’t line up more employment. In March 2008, 622,000 self-employed workers across the country put themselves in this category. A year later, the number had almost doubled, to nearly 1.1 million. “What you can see in this data spells real trouble for these people,” says Susan Houseman, a senior economist for the Upjohn Institute, a nonprofit research center.

That trouble is about not paying bills. It’s also about the vertigo of falling out of the middle class. “We talk about it as middle-class poverty,” said Sara Horowitz, founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union, which has 70,000 members in New York City. “Your frame of reference, when you think of yourself as middle class, doesn’t include being scared about making ends meet, realizing that welfare and food stamps are your only option. Psychologically, that shift is devastating.”

Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist who teaches at Columbia University, began to see early signs of that shift last winter in the coffee shops where he does fieldwork. Venkatesh is collecting work histories in the course of studying the off-the-books economy: in a chapter of Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt’s book “Freakonomics,” he was the clever Ph.D. student who noticed that many drug dealers lived with their mothers because they couldn’t afford their own housing.

Venkatesh observed that when the recession began, the spectrum of vulnerability among freelance workers broadened, from the sex workers he is currently studying to those in other professions. Every few months, Venkatesh goes to the same set of coffee shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn and talks to people who come in and sit down. “I’m looking for clues in weird places that won’t register for an economist,” he says. Venkatesh asks the coffee-shop patrons whether they are out of work, looking for work or have stopped looking in the past few weeks.

Venkatesh also asks people if they work for themselves. Over the years, he has observed the rise in the number of people who say yes. This year, he estimated, at least half of his coffee-shop sample was made up of the self-employed. Increasingly, they talk about their fading prospects. In 2005, 16 percent of the coffee-shop patrons Venkatesh talked to in Brooklyn and 34 percent in Manhattan said they were out of work, were looking or had recently given up looking. In April of this year, the figure rose to 37 percent in Brooklyn and spiked to 53 percent in Manhattan. Many of the coffee-shop patrons told Venkatesh that they had maxed out their credit cards and had no savings. He concluded that it wasn’t just many workers in the sex industry who were living at the edge of poverty — it could be anyone who had hung out their own shingle.

Venkatesh sees a difference in how freelancers talk about the recession compared with workers who have been laid off. “They’re more alone, and they can’t help but feel like they did something wrong because they’re losing relationships with individual clients,” he says. “They think of themselves as ministering to their clients, so they also feel guilty about no longer helping them.”

The instability of freelancing isn’t new. Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, points out that the share of workers who have standard full-time jobs with benefits has been shrinking since the 1980s. But in the past, temporary and on-call workers — everyone from data-entry employees to construction workers — were hit hardest by downturns. Now the higher-earning independent contractors are suffering, too. Meanwhile, unemployment insurance is still largely structured as it was when the system was instituted during the Depression. “Unemployment insurance was designed in 1935 to give temporary support to the classic male laid-off worker,” Katz says. “It’s not set up for the circumstances we see today, with a lot of people freelancing.”

President Obama’s recovery package includes incentives for states to modernize their unemployment-insurance laws by, among other things, covering more part-timers. “But it’s still tough for freelancers,” Katz says. At the Freelancers Union, Sara Horowitz is pushing for a new kind of unemployment protection fund that would cover the self-employed by helping them put away money that they could draw on in times of need.

In April, Lisa Feuer sent me another message from her iPhone: “I’m at the food-stamp office now, waiting.” For months, she had been putting off this trip. Feuer’s grandparents were Jews who immigrated to the United States from Vienna in 1939. She grew up in a small town in Illinois, where her parents taught public school. She has an undergraduate degree, having majored in sociology as well as Russian and Eastern European studies, and a master’s in multimedia arts. “It’s hard to imagine myself on poor people’s health insurance and food stamps,” she said. But she was deemed eligible for more than $300 in stamps a month, and her application was expedited so she could start receiving them the same day.

Venkatesh is picking up this kind of unexpected neediness in his research. He has four welfare caseworkers around the city who keep track of the clients who come in to ask about public assistance. “I wanted to understand whether ‘nontraditional’ welfare clients started to file paperwork,” Venkatesh wrote in an e-mail message. “Nontraditional means white, for Manhattan.” In 2005, the caseworkers reported that 5 percent of those who came to their offices were white. This year, the percentage has jumped to 26 percent.

Feuer is trying to find new sources of work. She has been auditioning to teach at new studios and e-mailing former clients to offer private lessons, and she added four hours a week of office work for Karma Kids Yoga. The owner, Shari Vilchez-Blatt, pays her teachers $15 an hour to answer phones, clean studios and hand out postcards. “I worry about my teachers all the time,” she says. Of the 27 who work for her, only two teach full time and none receive health insurance.

Some of the yoga teachers I talked to have started working as bartenders or waiters, the old standbys for New York artists. Feuer can’t work more nights than she already does because of Sasha. Instead she is planning to become certified to teach childbirth education. But she would have to put the $700 training fee on her credit card, which she is already using to pay some bills.

Ed Antoine, the SAT tutor, is also trying to pivot for the sake of his business. When he left his last programming job and opened a tutoring office in Park Slope in 2003, he lost much of the low-six-figure income he had earned writing software code. But he had saved money, and he figured he would make up the shortfall in earnings over time. He started charging $55 an hour as a tutor before he realized that some parents were willing to pay more and gradually raised his rates to $125. Antoine married, and he and his wife, who writes children’s books, had a baby. Last fall, he hit a high of 20 students; in November, he moved to a higher-rent storefront office. He paid the legal fees to incorporate and hired teachers so he could run early-reading classes.

But the recession ate the growth he was counting on. Antoine’s new classes didn’t fill, and his tutoring load dropped to 12 students, some of whom cut back to once or twice a month. By then, he had already begun marketing himself differently, approaching schools about setting up test-prep labs and courses. In March, he signed a contract to prepare eighth graders at a public school in Brooklyn for the entrance exam for the city’s specialized high schools. “I do think the whole notion of being entrepreneurial in education is still very viable,” he said. “Just not as a high-priced tutor.”

What will happen to urban freelancers when the recession ends? David Autor, the M.I.T. economist, says that the rise in self-employment doesn’t necessarily reflect an increase in the number of workers who want to work for themselves. Instead, it’s a shift driven in part by cyclical downturns and the disappearance of clerical and administrative jobs into the maw of computer technology and outsourcing. “I looked at the numbers in 1999, when everyone was talking about the Internet creating this new free-agent economy, and in fact, at that point self-employment was falling,” Autor says. “The reason was that times were good and there were jobs to be had, and when people can find good jobs, they’d rather be an employee.”

This suggests that once companies start hiring again, the supply of freelance tutors and personal chefs will decrease, making it easier for the people who want to earn a living on their own. Autor also expects demand for their ser​vices to rise. “Affluent parents won’t stop investing in their kids in the long run, given how anxious they are about their kids’ getting ahead,” he says. “People with money will still want health and fitness consultations. They’ll want people to come to their house and cook for them. All of that should come back.”

Feuer sometimes wonders what her life would be like if instead of dance and yoga, she had gone into video editing, a job that her master’s degree prepared her for. “I might be in a very different place now,” she said. “But so much time has passed since I went to school; that was 13 years ago. I couldn’t just jump back in. I wouldn’t know any of the programs they use. I’d have to start over again.”

Instead, Feuer is thinking about moving to a cheaper apartment, though she is not splurging on the $1,350-a-month place she lives in now: it’s a small two-bedroom in a brick-and-concrete row house in Kensington, on the ground floor. Street noises sometimes keep Sasha awake at night. A leak from the rain gutters left behind peeling paint and plaster in the bathroom.

While walking Sasha home from school one afternoon, Feuer stopped to check her phone for messages about substitute yoga jobs or auditions for teaching gigs — there were none. Sasha ran ahead, pointing out a new florist on the corner. When they got to their building, Feuer turned the key to the mailbox and Sasha took out the letters. Among them was Feuer’s student-loan bill. Because of a hardship deferral, she doesn’t have to pay it at the moment. But the loans are still out there, looming. She sighed and slipped the bill into her bag, out of sight.

271 2009-06-08 Re “Microsoft’s Search for a Name Ends With a Bing” (Business Day, May 29):

In your discussion of the branding for Microsoft’s new search engine, Bing, you quote one consultant who states that the name “has a promise that you are going to find what you are looking for,” while a former chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola holds the view that Bing “has no equity; it signals nothing.” These opposing views are based on a narrow, Western-language-centric evaluation of the name.

In Mandarin Chinese, the official dialect of China, the syllable romanized as bing holds many meanings, with the most common being ice, frozen and sick — hardly associations one would want users to make to a dynamic and nimble search engine that seeks to challenge the global industry leader.

Web users in China often ask the question, “Have you Googled it?” If we now replace the name Google with Bing, the question would sound like the common Chinese query, “Are you sick?”

272 2009-06-08 I agree with Andrew J. Cherlin that this is a time when families must pull together (“Married With Bankruptcy,” Op-Ed, May 29).

Clearly the recession makes the situation more difficult when couples want to get divorced and cannot afford to maintain two households. Parents of the divorced couple are often the light in a storm during a marital crisis. They provide love and support by putting out the welcome mat, opening their purse and spending more time babysitting.

Today seniors are feeling the economic pinch. Many have lost jobs, and their retirement accounts have been reduced 40 or 50 percent. They are having a harder time finding employment. Wanting to do more with less can be a strain for seniors who want to help heal their families. But for many parents, helping their adult children and grandchildren stabilize their lives is not a choice. It is a necessity.

273 2009-06-08 A serial streaker also interrupted play during the 2002 Wimbledon men’s final and the 2003 French Open men’s final. And in 2006, during Federer’s quarterfinal victory over Mario Ancic at Wimbledon, two men jumped onto the court with rackets in hand and tried to start a rally.

The most frightening intrusion was in 1993, when a man reached over a courtside railing in Hamburg, Germany, and stabbed Monica Seles, then the world’s top-ranked player, in the back.

What happened Sunday was disconcerting for Federer. After the security guards intervened, it was another nine seconds before the intruder was tackled.

Federer said he had not felt threatened in the past by spotlight-seeking interlopers.

“Normally, they always kind of look at me and go, ‘I’m so sorry I have to do this,’ because they have some sort of a reason for it, you know,” he said. “I remember the English guy was actually quite funny. He looked at me and goes, ‘I’m so sorry I have to do this.’ I was like, O.K., just don’t touch me, you know.”

But Sunday’s intruder touched Federer and left him shaken and off target for the remainder of the fourth game, which Soderling resumed only after checking with Federer to see if he was prepared to continue.

“It definitely threw me out of my rhythm a little bit,” Federer said. “One game later, I thought that maybe I should have sat down and taken a minute or two to kind of reflect on what just happened: ‘Was that real or what?’

“But I don’t know. I mean I wanted to play on and whatever, get over it. But it was a touch scary.”

Gilbert Ysern, the French Open’s new tournament director, said he deeply regretted the incident.

“It’s always a shame when it happens,” he said. “You can’t view it fatalistically, though. We will try all we can to find solutions before next year so it doesn’t happen again. We already have strict security measures in place, but we will review them.”
274 2009-06-08 JERUSALEM — Under mounting American pressure to define his intentions regarding peace efforts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Sunday that he would make a major policy speech next week mapping out the government’s “principles for achieving peace and security.”

The announcement came against the background of rising tensions with the Obama administration, which has demanded that Israel freeze all settlement construction in the West Bank. The Netanyahu government insists that construction within existing settlements should continue.

In another point of contention, Mr. Netanyahu has refused to endorse explicitly the notion of establishing an independent Palestinian state, a cornerstone of American and European policy on the Middle East.

In comments at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Netanyahu said, “We want to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with the countries of the Arab world, while attempting to reach maximum understanding with the United States and our friends around the world.”

His government, led by the conservative Likud Party, was sworn in nine weeks ago. Mr. Netanyahu says he has been reformulating Israeli peace policy. Some Israeli commentators have wondered how Mr. Netanyahu, whose last government fell apart in 1999, seemingly returned to office without a clear agenda.
275 2009-06-08 Meanwhile, the vague guesses of four years ago have been replaced by hard data. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which now collects trading information, was able to say last week that the $35.3 billion of outstanding swaps trades on G.M. netted down to possible payments between market participants of an unremarkable $2.2 billion.

There’s still room for improvement. Central clearing of trades is one effort. Transparency could be enhanced. Nonstandard credit derivatives, like those that laid the American International Group low, haven’t benefited as much from the market’s development. All the same, for the most common types of contract, the G.M. bankruptcy suggests the Wild West of credit derivatives is being tamed.

The leveraged buyout club’s chummy days may be over. Not long ago, the government was investigating private equity firms for acting too clubby. As the brewing battle over Clear Channel’s proposed $2.5 billion debt exchange suggests, however, it could soon be more like open warfare in the land of the barbarians.

Some private equity firms are trying to salvage overleveraged companies acquired during the boom by asking debt investors to exchange their existing holdings for other kinds of debt that may be less desirable. This is the case, for instance, with the radio company Clear Channel Communications. The plea from its owners, Bain and Thomas H. Lee, is facing resistance from creditors, according to The Financial Times.

The wrinkle is that some of the creditors are rival private equity firms, like Apollo and Blackstone’s debt hedge fund. Any rumble between private equity firms would be an about-face from the type of relationship they had when all was rosy in buyout land.

During the boom, club deals, where several private equity firms would get together to buy an asset, were the norm. The $11 billion buyout of SunGard in 2005, for example, had seven private equity buyers working together, including Bain and Blackstone. The Justice Department even looked into whether private equity firms were colluding, although that never turned into any charges.

Situations like the Clear Channel standoff look 180 degrees different. Now the private equity firms that are creditors — some sniffed around Clear Channel when it was for sale in 2006 — may think they will do best by forcing the company into bankruptcy, potentially wiping out the current owners and enabling them to take it over.

If it started getting nasty, it’s unlikely it would end with Clear Channel. The company’s private equity creditors own troubled companies of their own. And other buyout barons have scooped up debt in rivals’ distressed companies — a group of private equity firms including TPG last year bought a $12 billion portfolio of leveraged buyout loans from Citigroup.

That means any Clear Channel dissenters might find themselves fighting again soon — only on the other side.
276 2009-06-08 Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Ramirez is eligible to play in the All-Star Game because his suspension ends before the game.

“I don’t disagree with that,” Dodgers Manager Joe Torre said Saturday about a rule barring players from being honored after being suspended for banned substances. “I agree that if you do something wrong like that, there shouldn’t be a reward at the end of it. To me, it’s all about rewarding. When the votes were there and he was fourth, I said at the time I don’t think he should be there.”

Torre added, referring to Ramirez: “He’s played in a handful of games. He’s keeping somebody else off the team, and I think if you ask Manny, he’d tell you the same thing. It’s not fair.”

The N.F.L. and its players union agreed on such a rule two seasons ago, after San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman was voted to the Pro Bowl after testing positive for steroids in 2006. Merriman served a four-game suspension but played in the Pro Bowl. The N.F.L. took a stand. Major League Baseball and its players union should, too.

During the past two seasons, a number of players have become more vocal in their feelings about the use of steroids. Jimmy Rollins, Philadelphia’s shortstop, says that players who test positive for a banned substance should not be honored.

“If you get caught in the first half of the season, no matter who you are, what you mean to the game, you shouldn’t be an All-Star,” Rollins said Saturday. “It shouldn’t really be a question. Even if he’s leading in the voting or is second, he’s basically taking a spot for somebody else who is more deserving.”

Donald Fehr, the executive director of baseball’s union, did not take a position one way or the other but pointed to the existing contract.

“We have an agreement,” he said during a phone interview. “This situation was considered during the time the agreement was negotiated. If the suspension takes place during the time the All-Star Game is played, the player is not eligible. If it’s over, and he has completed the penalty, then he’s like any other player.”

An amendment to the existing language will not be considered until the next bargaining agreement.

There are obviously a number of complexities involved in the application of a new regulation. For example, would the penalty be applied to someone like the Phillies’ J. C. Romero, whose positive test was the result of taking a supplement that was tainted but was bought over the counter?

Would the penalty be applied in Ramirez’s case, where a suspension was for a substance that was not a steroid but which Ramirez acknowledged taking?

“There obviously are some stickers in there as far as inadvertent this, that and the other thing,” Torre said. “I can understand that, especially if you trust somebody that says this, that and the other thing. But that’s too bad, it’s still your responsibility. Even though Manny feels he was doing something else, he still didn’t shy away from the fact that, ‘Hey, I’m accountable for this,’ and that’s the way it should be.”

The second issue is that fans vote. They shouldn’t.

The fact that Ramirez has received so many votes suggests that the time has come to take All-Star Game voting privileges away, especially now that home-field advantage in the World Series is tied to the game. Fans are not in the business of sending moral messages.

At a time when the sport is drenched in a widespread scandal, fans continue to flock to games in robust numbers. That Ramirez would receive more than 600,000 votes underlies the need for a change. Some abuse the vote, some take it as a lark.

We talk about sending a message to players. What about sending a strong message to fans as well?

Take away their All-Star voting rights: that’s a message fans will understand.
277 2009-06-08 Q. It would be interesting to read your views on the issue of business entities being "TOO BIG TO BE ALLOWED TO FAIL." The Obama administration seems to have ignored this fundamental issue that is central to the future of both U.S. and global economics.

What, in your opinion, can and should be done to avoid the future (potential) need for taxpayer assistance to firms that are too big to be allowed to fail?

A. You both ask questions that go to the core of what went wrong and, just as important, what needs to be done to make sure another financial meltdown doesn’t happen again.

There is lots of blame to go around for what went wrong. Simply put, banks took excessive risks, government regulators didn’t provide sufficient oversight and too many borrowers — companies and individuals — took on more debt than they could afford. Now we are all in a bind as a result.

What have Wall Street, and Washington, learned? One of the most important lessons, I think, is that financial innovation in theory can be good, but isn’t always in practice. Anything taken to extremes can be risky, and has to be managed and regulated.

Take home mortgages. Few people could buy a house without them. But mortgages that require no down payment, and allow the borrower to pay less each month than the interest owed? That doesn’t make economic sense for the vast majority of borrowers, yet that’s precisely the kind of mortgage that many big banks were offering and that became popular during the housing bubble. And regulators blithely let it happen.

Credit cards? A convenience that lets you and me carry less cash in our wallets. But multiple cards that are given out like candy to people without steady income and with bad credit histories? Again, as astonishing as it sounds, that became common practice. Here, too, regulators failed to pay close attention.

I could go on, but you get the picture.

Healthy banks and a robust Wall Street are essential to making our economy tick. If they are over-regulated, that can stifle the business — which means fewer jobs created for Americans. If they are under-regulated, or poorly regulated, then . . . well, we know what happens, because we’re in the middle of it. The challenge for lawmakers and regulators, and for bank executives, is to get the balance right.

Clearly, figuring out how — and how much — to pay bankers is part of the fix. Working hard and figuring out new ways to finance business should be rewarded, but taking wild risks shouldn’t be. Yet that happened in recent years, as Times reporters found in examining the origins of the financial meltdown last year in our series The Reckoning (“On Wall Street, Bonuses, Not Profits, Were Real”).

A few banks already have reined in big salaries and stretched out bonuses over longer periods, so executives and traders don’t get big paydays before you know if an investment that looked good at the time might actually turn sour. But some Wall Streeters are resisting change, which is why Washington is paying close attention, and why we are covering this closely (“U.S. to Propose Wider Oversight of Compensation”).

Similarly, Washington is trying to get its arms around the “too big to fail” question. A global economy can’t work if we only have small, community banks. But if an institution is so big, and is allowed to take so many risks, that its failure could cause a financial meltdown and taxpayers have to rescue it, that poses a problem, too. Washington and Wall Street have to find a middle ground.

Q. I'm curious as to what percentage of your staff — reporters and editors — have actual, "hands on" business experience (other than after-school or college jobs) that gave them exposure to substantive workplace issues involving operations, payroll, policy, compeitiveness, labor relations, etc. Also, what percentage hold business, economics or other relevant degrees?

A. Jeff: Well, let me assure that I, for one, have been getting a lot more exposure than I’d like to substantive business and workplace issues lately. And I bet that everyone who works for a newspaper today feels the same.

Most editors and reporters got into the news business because they have a passion for exploring the important issues of our time, in all their complexity. For most of our lives, we didn’t even think of it as a business. Our revenue and profits were generally so stable that pay reductions and layoffs and benefit cutbacks were things that happened at companies in other industries, not ours.

Wow, has that changed. As I’m sure you know, even before the great recession hit, the newspaper (and magazine) business has started going through tectonic change. We’re not just reporting the story, we’re part of the story.

The Internet has changed our comfortable business model. Many papers are slashing their staffs. A few have even closed, or become online only publications. I firmly believe The Times will thrive, because we’ve embraced the Web — hey, Talk to the Newsroom is just one of many things we do online that we couldn’t easily do in print! — and we continue to do the kind of quality journalism that it’s hard to get in many other places. But, make no mistake, these are difficult times, and they give us a better insight than ever into what people in other troubled industries are going through.

I actually don’t know how many of my reporters have business or economic degrees, or experience working in other businesses. Some definitely do — I’ve got some M.B.A.s and some lawyers on the Business Day staff. But you don’t need that to be a great business reporter. You need smarts and curiosity and persistence and, yes, passion, to find out what is going on and tell it in a compelling way that brings the news to life and shows what it means to people and why it matters.

Q. I have been involved in resort real estate marketing for many years, and find that market continues to struggle. Developers, it seems, don't believe there are buyers out there, and have cut their marketing to bare bones.

Still, there are 80+ million baby boomers on the verge of retirement. Don't you think they have the means, and the desire, to purchase second homes in resort destinations?

Being involved in the industry that was at the center of the financial crisis can be a tough roost to occupy.

A. Actually, I’m going to have to be honest and disagree with you. I think I’m pretty safe in saying that there aren’t nearly as many baby boomers who have either the means, or the desire, to purchase a resort home, as a year or two ago.

Alas, some no longer are on the verge of retirement; given what has happened to their investment portfolios, they're going to be working longer than they planned.

So it isn’t surprising that marketers are holding their fire — although I’m sure that I speak for many in my industry who wish they were advertising more!

Indeed, a lot of people feel your pain. Not just people working for companies related to the housing industry — everyone from carpenters to small builders to mortgage lenders to furniture makers — but airlines and hotels and retailers and, well, just about anyone. Oh, did I forget auto makers? It may feel like you are at the center of the crisis, but you can’t be having a harder time than they are.

That’s what has made this recession so bad. Few businesses have been untouched, and confidence has been shaken badly.

What will it take to turn things around? Inevitably, things have to improve where the problems began — yep, the housing industry. With more people losing jobs, foreclosures continue to weigh heavily on the housing market, and efforts to slow them with mortgage relief haven’t yet worked, at least in part because there’s too little relief being offered many borrowers in trouble, as The Times has reported. (“Promised Help Is Elusive for Some Homeowners”.

There are, of course, some signs that things are getting better. The government stimulus program has helped offset weak spending by consumers, for example. And the nation’s biggest banks appear to be slowly on the mend, thanks in no small part to government bailouts.

But there still are likely to be rocky times ahead. So, while there must be some real bargains in the resort home market right now, I wouldn’t look for the business to pick up in a big way any time soon.

The Times vs. Everyone Else

Q. How would you define your coverage as different from The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times or other competitors?

A. Dan: Isn’t it obvious? The Times is the best. :)

Seriously, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times are fine and formidable publications. Having such stellar competition is good for us, good for them, good for the people we write about and good for you, the reader. I truly believe that all three are important to a robust democracy, and to enlightening readers about what is going on in the economy.

I figure you mostly want to know how we stack up vis-à-vis business coverage, but that is only part — albeit an important part — of a package The Times offers that is more comprehensive than any other newspaper. We cover international news, politics, national affairs, sports, science, the arts and lifestyles, as well as the New York region.

In covering business news, there are lots of similarities among us and our main rivals. We all aim to give readers big news scoops. We all broadly report on business, finance and the economy. We all strive to get the story behind the story, explaining to readers not just what is happening but also why and what it means, who is acting responsibly and who might be acting less so.

That said, each views coverage with a slightly different lens. The Financial Times focuses more on the world of finance (hence its first name), especially international finance. The Wall Street Journal has expanded its coverage of non-business news in the past year, but still prides itself on its coverage of the economy writ large, and of the biggest companies in important industries.

At The Times, we make it the highest priority to cover the big issues in the economy, business and finance. Coverage of companies matters to us, of course, but we are especially proud when we shed light on how the economy really works, when we highlight important public policy issues and when we raise questions about dubious business practices that warrant scrutiny.

“The Reckoning” series, about the causes of the financial meltdown that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for public service and is also finalist for a Loeb Award for financial reporting, is one recent example. Another series, “The Evidence Gap,” explored medical treatments used despite scant proof that they work despite their high costs. “Golden Opportunities,” examined how businesses and investors seek to profit from the soaring number of older Americans, in ways helpful and harmful. “Gilded Paychecks” looked at compensation practices to explain how big pay packages became so common in corporate America.

Our mission isn’t to write incremental stories, or routine “commodity” news that you can get elsewhere, but we do endeavor to cover everything important that an informed reader might want to know, which means being highly competitive on major breaking news, too. Our coverage of the Wall Street meltdown has been widely lauded (“Bids to Halt Financial Crisis Reshape Landscape of Wall St.”), as was the riveting coverage by a team of reporters about the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff, (“Madoff Scheme Kept Rippling Outward, Across Borders”). Times reporters also are finalists for Loeb awards later this month for their coverage of these momentous events.

And then there is our secret weapon — what Executive Editor Bill Keller refers to as the “murderers' row” of Business Day columnists. Gretchen Morgenson, Floyd Norris, Joe Nocera, Andrew Ross Sorkin, Ron Lieber and the three Davids: David Leonhardt, David Carr and David Pogue — provide valuable insight into the world of business and finance that you can’t get elsewhere.

Q. The business section has many columnists on a great variety of subjects, but not a columnist on consumer protection as such, despite the importance of consumer protection, as demonstrated recently by enactment of the Credit Card Act and the key role consumer protection failures played in causing the economic crisis, to take only two examples (I’m not referring to the type of column that focuses on helping consumers who have encountered problems in dealing with businesses, such as the Haggler column, or the “Your Money” column, which appears to focus more on personal investments). Why not?

A. Jeff: Ron Lieber, my “Your Money” columnist, is gnashing his teeth over your query.

I asked him for his thoughts, and he responded faster than you can say “consumer ripoff.”

As Ron puts it, “My goal in life is to write about anything and everything that hits you in the wallet. To me, investing is actually the simplest part of the equation, as long as you believe in the indexing gospel (and I do — still do). So ‘Your Money’ is not about personal investments at all — I maybe hit that topic, defined broadly (including retirement accounts) maybe 8-10 times per year.” You can look up all his past columns easily on the Web.

To show how consumer-friendly Ron is, I asked him jot down a few of his favorite consumer protection columns. Quicker than you can dial a call center in India, he emailed me the following list:

We also have other consumer protection coverage in Business Day. In addition to The Haggler, which you mentioned, we recently added a new column, “Patient Money.” It runs on Saturdays, and examines medical and insurance issues from a personal financial point of view. One recent column: “Strategies for Saving on Prescription Drugs.” And another Saturday column, “Shortcuts,” offers advice about an array of consumer topics, like one on the preposterous come-ons saying you can make a fortune working from your living room, “Work at Home and Make Big Money? Let the Wise Be Wary.”

You want more? We’re going to give you more. We will soon launch a consumer blog covering all of these issues, and then some. Watch this space.

Q. It's getting more and more difficult to understand business news because of all the abbreviated terms. What, for example, are apps, cited in the lead of the story on The Times Web page on Monday? It would be reader friendly to define such terms on first use.

A. Nat: You're right. One of our jobs is to make even complex things understandable, and cutting through the jargon can help the reader a lot.

One challenge, of course, is that the world is getting more complicated. Few readers had ever heard of credit-default swaps until they helped bring down the financial system last fall, and it wasn't all that long ago when even some business reporters would have had a hard time explaining clearly what CDSs are — oops, there I go abbreviating. A great thing about the Web is that you can find Times stories that explain them in fairly easy-to-understand terms. Our ace Wall Street reporter, Gretchen Morgenson, spotted the problem posed by credit-default swaps before just about anyone else, way back in February 2008. Her story "Arcane Market Is Next to Face Big Credit Test" defined a CDS by using an analogy: "Like a homeowner’s policy that insures against a flood or fire, these instruments are intended to cover losses to banks and bondholders when companies fail to pay their debts." And our terrific graphics department made it even easier to grasp by working up a smart illustration, "A Primer on Credit Default Insurance," that helped readers visualize how a CDS works.

We don't always do so well, as when we used apps as shorthand for applications. An application, or app, is a software program that is loaded onto smartphones, like the iPhone. These apps can do everything from letting you download New York Times stories that you can view on the phone's screen, to enabling you to use the phone as a digital voice recorder, to allowing you to watch live videos of sports events, like the Masters golf tournament.

I ran that past one of my tech editors — I mean technology editors — and he says that my explanation is right and easy for him to understand. For you, too, I hope.

Q. What does a P-E ratio tell us about any given stock? I know how it's determined, but I've never understood what it says about a company or a company's stock. Could you tell me in layman's terms and in plain English?

A. Lance: P-E ratio stands for price-to-earnings ratio, and it is one way of telling how expensive or cheap a company's stock is relative to other stocks. It refers to the ratio of the price of the stock to the earnings per share, thus helping an investor compare the profitability of one company versus another company.

As a general rule, the lower the ratio, the more reasonably priced the stock is for an investor. For example, if a company's stock trades for $10 a share, and the company earned $1 a share over the last 12 months, the P-E ratio is 10. If it trades for $10 a share, and the company earned just 50 cents a share, the P-E ratio is 20. You'd rather own a stock with higher profits than lower profits, of course, which is why the P-E ratio of 10 means the stock is more attractively priced.

Traditionally, stocks on average have a P-E ratio in the range of 12 to 18. When the P-E ratio rises to 20 or higher, some investors get nervous and decide to sell, because it means the company is making lower earnings for each dollar invested, as indicated by the stock price.

One caveat: Stocks expected to rise rapidly usually have high P-E ratios, because investors usually are willing to pay more for a stock with strong future growth prospects. Google, for example, currently has a P-E ratio of about 32, based on its closing stock price Monday of $439, and its annual earnings per share of $13.67. (Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the number of shares of stock a company has issued.)

Q. Given all the budget cutbacks -- not only at the Times, but throughout journalism -- combined with the absolute deluge of news amid the economic crisis, can you and your colleagues actually do your jobs? What is missing that we might have otherwise learned about if traditional journalism were healthier?

A. Alex: Doing good journalism takes time, and people. The best stories can take weeks, or even months, to research and write. Better technology has made some types of reporting much more efficient. You can access and search through databases online, rather than having to travel across the country to get a look at documents and records as you had to do in the past. But reporting a complicated story usually means interviewing a lot of people and sometimes means going someplace to see and hear what is going on. All of this costs money, and many newspapers — including The Times — have less as a result of declining advertising revenue.

I'm happy to say that I think we still have the resources to do the kind of great journalism that The Times has always done. We had eight Pulitzer Prize finalists this year, and five winners, a testament to the enterprising work being done here on a wide vareity of topics. We have lost some staffers, unfortunately, but — fingers crossed — so far haven't had to cut any important areas of coverage. As the business editor, I have compensated by moving more reporters to where the big story is — banking and finance — to make sure we aren't missing any major news and, even more, are doing the deep explanatory and investigative reporting that you expect of us, and that we expect of ourselves. We've now got nearly a dozen in Business Day devoting all or much of thier time to this important area of coverage. And my colleagues on the National and Metro staffs, and in the Washington bureau, are also devoting more resources to covering how the economy is affecting people around the region and the country. They've provided some terrific coverage we wouldn't otherwise have carried. Just one example: Damien Cave, the Miami bureau chief for The Times's National desk, wrote about a community devastated by the housing bust in a story headlined "In Florida, Despair and Foreclosures."

But you ask a good question when you wonder what is missing that we might otherwise have learned. I think that is a big issue in some cities where once-proud newspapers have laid off some of their talented reporters. We all depend on the type of digging and exposing that a good newspaper does, not just to keep everyone honest but to illuminate critical issues that need attention. Unfortunately, we often don't know what is missing until it is found — invariably, in the past, by a relentless reporter, and there are fewer and fewer at many newspapers.

Q. A few months ago, I was hearing lots of talk that the next crisis was going to be credit cards and credit card companies. I haven't heard anything along those lines in some time. Do you think the crisis has been averted or is it what I'm worried about — no one is talking because they fear more loss of consumer confidence, but that the debt is building and people are less able to pay than before?

A. Diane: You are right in asking about credit cards. Times reporters have written for some time that credit card defaults were bad and getting worse, and it still remains a problem, so we have continued to cover this issue.

The question is, how much worse might things get?

That depends, of course. How long with the recession drag on? How high will the unemployment rate go? The longer and higher, the greater the defaults on credit card debt, because it is hard to pay your monthly bills when you haven’t had a job for a long time. We started spotlighting this last fall, when banking reporter Eric Dash wrote a front page story on Oct. 28, “Consumers Feel the Next Crisis: It’s Credit Cards.”

More recently, on May 10, he teamed up with colleague Andrew Martin in a story headlined “Banks Brace for Credit Card Write-Offs.” We ran that story after the government’s stress tests of big banks indicated that, in an “adverse” economic situation, the nation’s 19 biggest banks could expect nearly $82.4 billion in credit card losses by the end of 2010. The story noted: “At American Express and Capital One Financial, around 20 percent of the credit card balances are expected to go bad over this year and next, according to stress test results. At Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, about 23 percent of card loans are expected to sour.”

How high are those numbers? Well, consider that banks wrote off an average of 5.5 percent of their credit card balances last year, and even at the end of the year the rate of write-offs was just 6.3 percent. And, after the technology bubble burst in 2001, credit card losses got as high as 7.9 percent.

So, anything near the figures under the government’s “adverse” scenario would be worrisome numbers if they come to pass, because credit cards in the past have been among the most profitable businesses of the big banks. If they instead rack up big losses on credit cards, it will be harder for them to recover.

We can hope that the nascent signs of economic improvement mean that the losses will be lower. But, this is one of the many unknowns still clouding the economic outlook.

About the U.S. Auto Industry

Q. Newspaper accounts state New G.M. and Chrysler will have competitive wage structures. Ron Gettelfinger states current employees will not lose wages, benefits or pensions. Does this mean G.M. and Chrysler will have competitive wage structures in 20 years when the present employees have retired?

Q. Were the secured creditors in Chyrsler placed in a worse position because of the government bailout money (which I am assuming had to be paid back first)? In other words, had there been no bailout money, would the secured creditors have more Chrysler assets to be paid back out of?

By the way, I do not consider bondholders as greedy speculators — I can "empathize" with them, because I myself could have purchased a bond thinking it was a safe investment for retirement.

A. Ken and Susan: It wasn’t that long ago (was it?) that pop bands were celebrating the U.S. auto industry. I still remember the Beach Boys singing about a girl having “fun, fun, fun, till her daddy takes the T-Bird away” (a k a, the Ford Thunderbird). And Jan & Dean crooning about the “Little Old Lady From Pasadena” driving her “brand-new, shiny red, super-stock Dodge” to the refrain, “Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!”

Ah, yes, the good old days.

But as your queries show, the once-proud auto industry is going through hard times.

The biggest issue, of course, is whether U.S. automakers have come out of this painful restructuring more competitive. The issue is yes — but a qualified yes, so far, rather than a resounding yes. General Motors and Chrysler both have reduced their costs as a result of being forced into bankruptcy, while Ford has cut its costs, too, albeit to a lesser extent, without receiving government aid and going through bankruptcy.

They have done this in a number of ways: bankruptcy allowed G.M. and Chrysler to wipe out most of their debt, so their interest expense is very low. They have laid off thousands more workers, cutting both management and labor costs. In an agreement with the United Auto Workers, the companies are giving them stock to finance a large part of their unfunded pension obligations, thus saving lots of cash. And, while the U.A.W. did technically manage to keep wages and benefits the same for current workers, the union made concessions — like eliminating the “jobs bank” in which workers received nearly all of their regular pay even if they sat around doing nothing; requiring union members to work longer to receive overtime pay; and easing restrictive work rules.

Will that alone make the automakers competitive? Well, it puts their costs more closely in line with foreign transplants — like Toyota and Honda — that make cars in the United States. (For an analysis of how the Big Three’s costs stacked up before the restructuring, read this lucid column by David Leonhardt, “$73 an Hour for Autoworkers And How It Really Adds Up.”

Regardless of costs, however, to be truly competitive the Big Three in the end have to make cars that people want to buy.

The question about how creditors were treated in bankruptcy is interesting, because it has sparked much debate. Secured creditors appealed to the Supreme Court the agreement that was reached to enable Chrysler to emerge from bankruptcy court proceedings; after delaying the deal for a day, the Supreme Court decided on Tuesday not to hear the appeal.

The appeal revolved around the secured creditors’ complaint that they should have received far more than the 29 cents they are getting for each dollar of the $6.9 billion owed them; that’s because, they argue, bankruptcy law gives secured creditors higher standing than everyone else.

This issue is important, and not just for Chrysler. If the Supreme Court had decided to hear the appeal, it could have been the first test for the authority being exercised by the Obama administration. The government moved quickly to restructure Chrysler by using all of its persuasive power to get reluctant parties to go along, with the aim of keeping the bankruptcy proceedings from getting bogged down for months or longer. But secured creditors felt the bankruptcy judge moved too quickly, without fully considering their position.

To your point about whether secured creditors got less because the government loaned TARP money to Chrysler, the answer is not really. The government isn’t being repaid its loan; instead, it is getting stock in Chrysler in lieu of repayment of the loan money. Of course, the creditors could have received that stock if it hadn’t gone to the government, but then taxpayers would have felt cheated for their help in keeping Chrysler alive.

We live in fascinating and historic economic times.

Q. What are the 10 safest banks in America for one's life savings? Who publishes a list of safe banks?

A. I am not aware of anyone publishing a list of the safest banks in America. But you don’t really need a list to feel that your life savings are safe in a United States bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — i.e., the federal government — insures deposits up to $250,000 in banks. If you have more than that to deposit, F.D.I.C. insurance will cover up to $250,000 deposited in a different bank, and on and on and on, if you’re really loaded and want to stash it in lots of banks. Just remember that as long as you keep no more than $250,000 in any bank, you should be able to sleep easy.

Where Is the Investigative Reporting?

Q. Your comments to date regarding business writers is that you find them curious individuals and curiosity, persistence, and passion are characteristics that make for good journalists. Unfortunately, it seems more and more that todays journalists are reporting on the "crash" instead of the dangers on the track before the crash. It seems that for the most part that "investigative" in investigative journalist has become a lost art. Can you opine on why journalism is trending more this way? The state of our financial markets, the excess risk posed by banks and the problems with present regulatory environments were hardly spoken about until after the collapse when suddenly everybody had an opinion to write. Do you not think that some of this could have been averted if the media was more the leader than the follower in reporting potential crisis or conflicts?

A. I can’t agree more with you about the importance of investigative journalism. It matters. It isn’t easy to do well, because it requires time to deeply report an issue. That means a newspaper needs enough reporters, because a few won’t be writing the daily news and enterprise you want and expect from us every day. Some publications, sadly, no longer have the staffs for investigative journalism.

The Times does. Indeed, I think you are wrong in saying that we (and others in some cases) didn’t ring alarm bells about the potential problems in the financial and housing markets, long before things started melting down in 2007.

Maybe some people didn’t read our stories, or don’t remember reading them, but we were writing them. Lots of them.

In March 2000, New York Times business reporter Diana Henriques worked on a joint investigative project with ABC News, “MORTGAGED LIVES: A special report.; Profiting From Fine Print With Wall Street's Help,” revealing how predatory home equity loans were being diced up into mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors. The publicity drove the abusive mortgage company into bankruptcy, but it didn't awaken federal regulators.

In August 2003, Times business columnist Gretchen Morgenson wrote a column headlined, "Mortgage Markets Are Out of Control." She warned about "the huge mortgage-backed securities market and the leveraged traders who call it home." She wrote that mortgage bond market was becoming increasingly volatile, suggesting that traders could not adequately hedge their risks. She cited one expert who "fears that the size of the market and the fact that so many players are heavily leveraged make a disaster almost inevitable."

In June 2004, Edmund Andrews in our Washington bureau wrote a story headlined, "The Ever More Graspable, And Risky, American Dream," about the dangers of some loans made to low-income homebuyers: "A kaleidoscopic array of mortgages for people with little cash or overstretched budgets has enabled families of modest income to take on debt that once would have been beyond their reach." He quoted experts who were worried that many first-time buyers could be pushed into default.

In March 2005, Times reporters David Leonhardt and Motoko Rich wrote a front-page story, "Trading Places: Real Estate Instead of Dot-Coms," that compared how the excesses of the dot-com era were being repeated in housing. After reciting the many parallels, the story stated: "Another lingering echo of the stock market boom is the role of the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank. In the 1990's, the Fed kept interest rates relatively low because it saw little risk of rising inflation despite a booming economy, helping feed a fever for stocks."

Again, in July 2005, Ed Andrews wrote a prescient story headlined, “Loose Reins on Galloping Loans.” It warned: “For two months now, federal banking regulators have signaled their discomfort about the explosive rise in risky mortgage loans.” They had cautioned banks not to let homebuyers borrow too much. They had fretted about no-money-down mortgages and “liars’ loans” that required no proof of income. “The impact so far?” the story asked. “Almost nil.” Why? Because federal banking regulators were reluctant to take corrective action, for fear they would “stifle financial innovation,” one bureaucrat told him.

In August 2005, in a story headlined, “Good News, Bad News: Your Loan's Approved,” Eduardo Porter, then an economics reporter, wrote: “Many first-time home buyers are being pushed into the embrace of creative financing. As the housing boom lifts the median home price way beyond the budget of huge numbers of Americans, middle-income home buyers are increasingly turning to such mortgages — a decision that could well come back to haunt both them and the banks behind the loans later on.”

There are dozens and dozens more. Just a few:

Could the crisis have been averted if we had written even more? I wish we had as much power as you suggest. We have covered the excesses of executive compensation, well, excessively, including in the “Gilded Paychecks” series I mentioned in an earlier answer, yet executive pay kept rising.

I can assure you that we will stay on the beat, and continue to do the type of enterprising and investigating reporting that puts the spotlight on important issues and potential problems. But it is up to regulators and legislators to take it from there.

Q. There are a lot of studies that say that small businesses are a strong growth engine for the economy. Yet The Times devotes a small amount of ink on Tuesdays to covering small business. Clearly there’s been a lot of news about large companies suffering from the current economy. But some of the news seems to be “commodity news” — articles that you can get elsewhere. Couldn’t The Times devote more space to small businesses as a way to tell the story behind the story? For example, it’s not so just that dealerships are closing around the country — it’s the impact on the businesses that surround dealerships. (Richard Perez-Pena could look at the decline in dealership advertising and its pending impact on an already battered local media.) Or a deeper look at how small businesses are trying to survive the credit crunch. The financial impact of boomers as their parents may consider declaring bankruptcy, and need their adult children’s financial support.

A. Norman, do you have an inside source at The Times? If not, then maybe you are clairvoyant, because your question comes just as we are expanding our coverage of small business.

The reason is simple. As you note, small businesses are important to our economy. The Small Business Administration says they generate as much as 80 percent of all net new jobs.

Much of our new coverage will be on NYTimes.com. Next week we plan to launch a new blog devoted to small business, called “You’re the Boss.” A lot of business owners feel as though they have few places they can turn for advice and support, and we think this blog will give them smart ideas about managing their businesses.

One of the continuing themes will be the challenges, stresses, and rewards of being an entrepreneur. We will also write about the economy from a small business perspective; the politics and policy of small business; and financial advice tailored specifically for business owners. Interestingly, owners, perhaps because they’re a little too comfortable with risk, have a reputation for not being very good at investing their own money.

We’ve already started running more small business stories on the Web (here’s one that found that complaints about the small-business credit squeeze may be overblown, and here’s one about an unusual new social network for entrepreneurs).

But the new blog will be the first big step in our effort to re-think our online small-business coverage.

So, watch this space for lots more new features in the coming months.

Q. I was hoping that New York Times would do more reporting on how the recession is affecting China and India. Do you have any plan to increase reporting on those two major economies of Asia?

A. If you are reading this, you are at the NYTimes.com site. Go to the search box, and type Keith Bradsher (our business correspondent based in Hong Kong). Or David Barboza (our man in Shanghai). Or Vikas Bajaj (Mumbai). Or Heather Timmons (New Delhi).

You will see many stories about how the recession is playing out in these countries.

As we have found in the past year, there is truly a global economy, and what happens in the United States affects Europe and Asia and the rest of the world. And vice versa.

We consider covering the other major economies of the world — China and India, yes, but Germany, Britain, France and the rest of Europe, as well as Japan and Russia — as a core part of our coverage mission. There never seems to be enough room in the paper for all the stories we would like to run on any topic, but I do think we’ve done a good job of covering how the financial meltdown, and the recession in its wake, have rippled around the globe. And that includes China and India.

Just a few stories in recent months include a look at the stock market resurgence in China, India and other parts of the developing world (“Developing Markets in Bloom Again”); the challenges facing the Indian economy (“India, Suddenly Starved for Investment”); the real estate bust in China (“Banks Face Big Losses From Bets on Chinese Realty”); the concerns about China slowing its puchaes of U.S. government debt (“China Cuts Bond Buys From U.S. And Others”).

Again, these stories are an integral part of what we do. Even more international business news can be found on our Global Edition Web site, at global.nytimes.com.

Q. How do you decide when a breaking news story is ready to publish? Before the Internet that decision was made for you. It was when the presses ran. Now you could theoretically publish breaking news stories real time, sentence by sentence, as they were happening. Obviously, there is a vast middle ground in there. What does it look like?

A. Fred: In the brave new world of newspapers, there are multiple deadlines. Like some voters in Chicago, we believe in "early and often," in our case when it comes to publishing.

Because our readers expect the most important news when it happens — not tomorrow morning, when they pick up the printed New York Times — we give it to them now. Or they will go elsewhere.

If it is a scoop, our inclination now is to post it online right away, except in unusual circumstances. Not so long ago, we hoarded those for the printed paper, but so many of our readers first get their news online that we want to give them the latest.

If it's a major breaking news story, we have to give you something different tomorrow than what we gave you online today.

Here’s what I mean: If a story breaks early in the morning, we give you the straight news. Assuming it is important enough, we also start reporting and writing a richer, more analytical story for the next day’s paper, what we have come to refer to as a second-day story on the first day. I could cite many examples of this, but one of the best is our coverage of the Microsoft takeover bid for Yahoo early in 2008. The news broke in the early morning on a Friday. We wrote and updated the news throughout the day, and came out with a package of smart, incisive analysis in the Saturday paper:

The challenge is to have something for you, the reader, to want — and need — to come to us for, both online and in the paper. Getting that right is the most important thing in the media’s Internet age.

What So Bad About Deficit Spending?

Q. We keep hearing about the growing deficit. What are the tangible negatives of the deficit/ loss jobs, lower living standard,higher interest rates etc. I would like a layman's explanation that I can share with my 14 year old what the negatives are that he(he is bright) will understsan if he reads it.

A. Tim: Budget deficits in and of themselves aren’t bad. Few people could buy a house without going into debt by taking out a mortgage; lots of people do, and never have a problem.

But, as with anything, excessive budget deficits can be bad, in many ways.

Perhaps the best way for your 14-year-old to understand this is to think of the U.S. budget just like the family’s household budget — only with a heck of a lot more zeros. You can have a budget deficit and live beyond your current cash income, but only for a while and only if the deficit doesn’t get too big.

If you are running a deficit in your household budget — i.e., you are spending more than your income — you probably are borrowing (with a mortgage, or by purchasing things on your credit card) to make up the difference between your current income and your expenses.

No problem — if your earnings are increasing, or if you expect to receive a big inheritance (or win the lottery). You can keep buying new cars, sending your kids to expensive colleges, going on long vacations at five-star resorts in the Caribbean, etc.

But let’s say that your earnings aren’t increasing. Or, even worse, maybe they’re decreasing, because your hours at work got reduced, or you don’t get a bonus. And let's say that you added a lot more debt than you planned, like the government sometimes does. All of a sudden, you are having a hard time paying your bills. Banks aren't keen on lending you any more money. Your credit card company reduces the amount that it will let you charge and, because you now pose a higher risk of not paying, it charges you a higher interest on the amount you owe. To pay down your debt — to balance your budget, as it were — you have to cut spending on lots of things (i.e., your standard of living declines), at least for a while. For your 14-year-old, that means less cash from dad for going to the latest blockbuster movie, or for buying the hot new video game from Wii, or for spending a day at the nearest amusement park.

That basically is what happens when a country’s debt grows too big. Investors shy away from lending money to the government — i.e., buying government bonds — or buy bonds only if they are paid a higher interest rate. Until its income starts growing, the government has to cut corners, reducing services or putting off highway repairs or even laying off workers. The government, of course, has the authority to increase its income whenever it wants, by raising taxes. As a result, it can increase its borrowings more easily than you can. Indeed, many economists argue that deficit spending by a government is an important way to get the economy growing again during a recession, which is why the federal government increasing our national debt now may be a good thing short term and not a bad thing.

But at some point, there is a limit to how much it can raise taxes, for all sorts of reasons. So, just like the Smiths and the Joneses, Uncle Sam can't get away with spending a lot more than it is taking in forever.

Q. I am not a Wall Street maven, a banker or financial type — I am a house builder in Philadelphia. My business, retirement, kids future, outlook — my world — has been turned upside down. I hear the news telling me it is because “the irresponsible borrowers who knew they couldn’t afford a mortgage but went forward anyway” caused the meltdown. And, because of that, the very banks that provided the mortgages then needed to be bailed out, and then an insurance company needed a bailout, and then a car company needed a bailout.

Now it seems that some banks want to repay the bailout funds to get away from the government setting rules on salary, etc. In less than six months the banks went from near death to profitability! So much so that they can still post a profit while paying back the government.

Something just doesn’t smell right, as my father would say!

I can’t get a bank to loan me a dime for my business, people are being laid off, interest rates are rising, and the cost of gasoline goes up even though demand is down and oil prices are down. I don’t see any way that I could have or will make an impact on any of the stuff that is controlling me. And the thought of the government being more a part of my life has scared me to death.

So could you explain to those of us who are just trying to go day to day what is going on and how we got here — in layman’s English, please?

A. Joe: I hear you. The financial meltdown, and the ripple effect through the economy, has many layers of complexity. Few experts — economists, Wall Street bankers, government regulators, corporate executives — anticipated the debacle, and fewer of those predicted just how bad it would be.

There is, as I noted in an earlier answer, lots of blame to go around. Many Americans have been living beyond our means: buying more luxury goods, taking more expensive vacations, going out to dinner more and, most of all, buying bigger houses than we can afford — and merrily borrowing as if the bills would never come due.

I’d like to point you to a several columns written by David Leonhardt, one of my business columnists, that I think explain in easy-to-understand terms what was happening and why. The first ran early in the crisis, the second in the middle of the crisis and third this March (toward the end of the crisis, we hope.) David writes about complicated topics with great sophistication and great clarity.

The columns, in order, are: “Can’t Grasp Credit Crisis? Join the Club,” “Lesson From a Crisis: When Trust Vanishes, Worry,” and “The Looting of America’s Coffers.”

The goal of all the action coming out of Washington now, of course, is to address some of the problems that are affecting people like you. Various financial bailout programs are intended to grease the loan markets, though many banks remain cautious in making loans because they fear some of their existing loans still will turn sour if the economy weakens. And the stimulus money is aimed in large part at limiting worker layoffs.

You are right in wondering how it is that banks seemed to be troubled and were helped by bailout money but are now getting away from government rules and making profits again. While that may seem aggravating, the reality is that we do need a healthy — and profitable — financial system to get the economy going again; plus, it is worth noting that the most troubled banks that still have bailout money are still under stricter regulatory constraints regarding pay and other practices.

As for rising interest rates, we will have to get used to it. The federal government is borrowing at an unprecedented level. The more it borrows, the higher the interest rate that investors will want for buying government bonds — which has the effect of pushing up interest rates for all borrowers.

Yes, this is painful, and will continue to be painful; and no, it doesn’t seem fair to people who didn’t contribute to the problems. But this is the price that we all are having to pay for living too large as a nation.

What Did You Say the Market Did?

Q. Given the power of words to influence, it concerns me that the verbs used to describe movements in the stock market certainly, but also in housing, employment, etc., have the potential to shape public opinion and confidence. But they seem to be used inconsistently and often for effect rather than information.

How, for example, do you decide whether to say that the market went down, slid, decreased, dropped, fell, plummeted, crashed, etc., or alternatively went up, rose, increased, soared, etc.? In the interest of helping the public understand financial trends, should the use of such descriptions be standardized in your paper or even across financial reporting in general?

A. Jill, I fell upon your query while going through my e-mail, and immediately dropped everything to write an answer lest my P.C. crash or the computer server go down for some reason. I’m hoping I can rise to the occasion and increase my productivity with this response.

Okay, enough. You raise a valid point, one that I think reporters and editors try to keep in mind, though we need to be constantly vigilant.

Words matter because, as you note, collectively they can influence opinion, and we need to be careful in using them.

So, when is a negative day in the stock market a decline versus a fall or a drop or a plunge or a plummet or a (yikes) crash?

Some of these verbs are interchangeable, because the meanings are similar, while others clearly aren’t. Crash, for example, is a word rarely used when referring to stock market declines because of the connotation.

But there is no easy definition when it comes to crash, either. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average, uh, went down 22.6 percent on Oct. 19, 1987 — Black Monday — The Times eschewed the word, instead reporting: “Stock market prices plunged in a tumultuous wave of selling yesterday, giving Wall Street its worst day in history and raising fears of a recession.” The Wall Street Journal, less restrained, wrote simply: “The stock market crashed yesterday.”

On the other hand, I do think it is appropriate to refer to a long-term, high-double-digit decline — like the 50 percent or so drop in stocks from their peak in the fall of 2007 to the low point in March of this year — as a crash, though we might qualify it as a creeping or slow-motion crash.

But in the end, the choice of word is a matter of judgment. I think it’s O.K. to say that the market plunged if the drop is, say, 8 percent or more in a single day, and I certainly would excise it from an article if the market dropped less than that, especially if it was 5 percent or less. Ditto for plummet (which in my mind is akin to a plunge, although maybe not as steep, though I’m sure others would differ).

One of my colleagues points out, though, that it is appropriate in some cases to say the stock market plunged in rare instances even if it ended positively for the day. How can that be? Well, what if the market was up 6 percent at 3:45 p.m., and ended up only 0.1 percent when trading closed 15 minutes later? A drop-decline-fall (words that I think can pretty much be used interchangeably) of 5.9 percentage points in 15 minutes is so steep that it warrants a strong verb to describe the velocity of the drop.

I also vetted my answer with David Gillen, my finance editor, and he had another smart thought:

I hope you like my answer. Or should I say my response?

Q. Actually this is feedback, not a question: The series of articles from your business correspondent in Japan comparing and contrasting the U.S. and Japanese economies have been very enlightening. Please keep them coming and know that they are appreciated.

A. Michael: Thanks so much. You will forgive me this indulgence, but I have received a number of notes like this complimenting our business and economic coverage, and I haven’t responded to any.

Both Hiroko Tabuchi, our business correspondent in Tokyo, and Martin Fackler, who preceded her as business correspondent and is now the bureau chief reporting to the foreign desk, have done a terrific job putting into perspective what is going on Japan and comparing it to the U.S. Not only have they written about the here-and-now, but they also have compared what is happening in the U.S. today with the lost decade in Japan when its real estate bubble burst in the 1990s. In a global economy, one of our main missions is to provide our readers with global coverage, especially coverage of events that have a broad effect on the major economies in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Comparing and contrasting what is happening in these different economies is a major part of what we can tell readers to help them understand what is going on. Our correspondents covering business in Europe — Nelson Schwartz in Paris, Landon Thomas and Julia Werdigier in London, Carter Dougherty in Frankfurt and Andrew Kramer in Moscow — have made this a focus of their reporting, too, along with our reporters in Asia, whom I mentioned in an earlier response about economic coverage of China and India.

Take a bow, Hiroko and Martin, along with your colleagues. And, for readers who might have missed their work from Japan that is lauded by Mr. Blumstein, here are just a few articles: “In Japan’s Stagnant Decade, Cautionary Tales for America,” “Japan’s Big-Works Stimulus Is Lesson,” “When Consumers Cut Back: An Object Lesson From Japan,” “Japan Pays Foreign Workers to Go Home,”; “In Japan, New Jobless May Lack Safety Net” and “Japan’s Slump Tests Faith in the Resilience of Stocks.”
278 2009-06-08 Previously unreleased recordings by the Who, the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane are to be included on “Woodstock — 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur’s Farm,” a six-CD boxed set of 77 songs to be released on Aug. 18 on Rhino Records to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock music festival, Billboard reported. Plenty of other performers, including Ravi Shankar, Joan Baez and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, will be represented in the set and even some of the colorful stage announcements from the 1969 festival are included.
279 2009-06-08 Roger L. Kay, one of the most prominent analysts of the PC industry, described the new generation of machines as “Franken-products,” a reference to the monster cobbled together from various parts.

For years, the popular industry term used to describe the collision of computers and cellphones has been “convergence.” But based on what’s coming soon to a store near you, it seems that “divergence” may be the more apt moniker. There is now a quasi-laptop for just about every need and want.

This month, consumers will start to see a fresh crop of cheap, thin, ultra-light notebooks arrive at chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. Top-of-the-line computers in this category used to cost around $2,000, but the newer products will sell for less than $600.

Too expensive? The computer industry offers other options. Companies like Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Acer and Asustek Computer are introducing lines of netbooks, the sub-$400 laptops aimed at simple tasks.

And if all you want to do is browse the Web, the latest netbooks shown here, built around cellphone chips, can display high-definition video and still last for up to 18 hours on a single charge. They should start appearing in stores this fall for less than $150 and weigh less than two pounds.

At the feathery end of the weight scale, Asustek, the Taiwanese company that created netbooks, even promoted a computer that is just a keyboard with a small screen attached to its right side. The keyboard connects wirelessly to the Internet and lets people crank away at their e-mail, instant messages and documents.

On the show floor, it seemed that anything with a display took on laptop-like functions. There were pads to scribble on, smart photo frames that connected to the Web and videoconferencing systems aimed at consumers rather than corporate customers.

Some of the products ran Windows, some ran Android software and some ran software that most people have never heard about. The “Intel inside” notion still held for most of the machines, but quite a few had Snapdragon from Qualcomm, Tegra from Nvidia and Ion, also Nvidia, chips inside, too.

Even on the larger, more traditional PCs, the beige box has given way to computers with LCD panels, touch-screen software and decorated cases — some with floral patterns meant to appeal to a woman.

“All these Franken-products can’t possibly exist, but they do, like a menagerie of imaginary animals,” Mr. Kay, the head of Endpoint Technologies Associates, wrote in a research note about Computex.

The industry cannot even agree on what to name some of these odd new creatures. A small laptop with an Intel chip is normally called a netbook. But a netbook with a cellphone chip is called a smartbook, according to some companies’ marketing departments. Microsoft, meanwhile, prefers to call them all “low-cost small notebook PCs.”

And wireless phone carriers might well start calling them something else entirely as they race to begin selling laptops with bundled data plans directly to consumers.

“We have been flying the carriers around the world,” said Michael Rayfield, the general manager of mobile products for Nvidia, one of many chip companies producing parts for these new laptops. “They all want to meet the manufacturers and come up with their own look and feel.”

A 30-person company called Mobinnova worked with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn for just four months to make what amounts to the thinnest, most power-efficient laptop for the carriers. Called the Elan, the Nvidia-based device can run for up to 24 days on a single charge if it is just playing music or run for 10 hours straight playing high-definition video.

Mike Holland, Mobinnova’s vice president for business development, said that one telecommunications company, which he declined to name, will start offering the product before the Christmas shopping season at a price of $49 to $99.

Mr. Holland said that later takes on the Elan will be thinner, lighter and more varied. “We’re already working on three or four more different products that advance this concept,” he said.

At least two more phone carriers plan to release Nvidia-based laptops, according to Mr. Rayfield, although he said that Nvidia withdrew planned demonstrations of the devices at Computex because the phone companies wanted to keep their competitors from seeing the designs.

Many of the new PCs feature a layer of touch-screen software that lets people sort through their music collections and photos with the flick of a finger. Some of the more complex versions even let children to draw pictures and put animated figures into their creations.

It is unclear if any of these products will take off and lead to a reinvention of the PC.

“With the exception of netbooks, no market for them has been established,” Mr. Kay wrote. “We’ll have to see what sticks as buyers vote with their pocketbooks.”
280 2009-06-08 He made that point in 2005 in a semimonthly newsletter that he published for many years. Five days before his death, he republished the article in the same newsletter, Economics and Portfolio Strategy, adding a prologue in which he said, “With hindsight, most readers today would find our position in 2005 to have been a prescription for tragedy.”

Then, quoting the Alfred Lord Tennyson line, “ ’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,” he concluded: “There was wisdom in Tennyson’s words. Who can say he was wrong beyond debate? That would be a sorry world indeed.”

Mr. Bernstein was the founder, in 1973, of Peter L. Bernstein Inc., which published his newsletter and also had as clients wealthy families and foundations, helping them manage their wealth. A year later, he founded the Journal of Portfolio Management, a scholarly journal that brought traders and academics into communication with each other as they developed efficient market theory.

They did so, in part, because more and more Americans held stock, mainly through mutual and pension funds. Picking stocks with a broker no longer met most people’s needs.

“As institutions and professional managers became the principal players, innovation was inevitable,” Mr. Bernstein wrote in “Capital Ideas,” his best-known book on efficient market theory. “But innovation must be preceded by theory.”

In the last 25 years of Mr. Bernstein’s life, nearly all his work focused on markets. But he had cast a broader net earlier, particularly in his writings with the late Robert L. Heilbroner, a historian and the author of a classic economics book, “The Worldly Philosophers.”

Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Heilbroner, both New Yorkers, were lifelong friends. They met in first grade at the Ethical Culture School and moved on together to Horace Mann Academy and then Harvard, graduating in 1940 with degrees in economics. For 25 years, until Mr. Heilbroner’s death in 2005, they made a point of having lunch together on the day before Christmas.

Like many others of their era, they were Keynesians, and they argued that public spending was necessary for a healthy market economy. They also argued that government’s role in the economy should not have been curtailed as President Ronald Reagan sought to do in the 1980s, when he argued that the deficit was too large to maintain public spending. It was not too large, they said, as a percentage of the nation’s economic output.

Peter Lewyn Bernstein was born in Manhattan on Jan. 22, 1919, a son of Allen and Irma Lewyn Bernstein. After graduating from Harvard magna cum laude, and after a year as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York — working for a Harvard professor who had gone to the Fed — he spent World War II as an officer in the Office of Strategic Services, the C.I.A.’s predecessor, in London.

While in Europe, he married the former Shirley Dowd, an American working as a secretary for the military. She died in 1971. The couple was childless. In 1972, Mr. Bernstein married a widow, Barbara L. Soskin, who took his last name. She survives, as does a stepgrandson, Peter Brodsky of Dallas, from Mrs. Bernstein’s first marriage, and three stepgreat-grandchildren.

After the war, Mr. Bernstein taught at Williams College and then became a loan officer in a commercial bank in New York, learning about risk, he later explained, as he assessed the creditworthiness of the borrowers.

Family pressure led him to Wall Street. After his father died in 1951, the family insisted that he take control of the father’s business, Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a wealth management firm. It was sold in 1967 and Mr. Bernstein stayed on as manager until 1973, having agreed to do so.

But he had already immersed himself in writing and scholarship, and from then on he focused on markets and risk, with occasional digressions. One of those was “Wedding of the Waters: The Erie Canal and the Making of a Great Nation” (W.W. Norton, 2005), in which he returned to public works spending.

“Without the gritty determination of a small group of men convinced of the prospect of a great nation,” he wrote, “the Erie Canal would not have been built and the Western territories would in all likelihood have broken away.”
281 2009-06-08 In his fourth consecutive French final, his first without Nadal tormenting him with topspin crosscourt forehands, Federer conquered the clay, his last untamed surface, and claimed his 14th career Grand Slam title, pulling even with Pete Sampras, with Wimbledon up next.

“He came back in matches in this tournament, was able to tough it out after what seemed like his darkest hours,” Courier said.

“He looked like he was about to lose it when Soderling was serving to stay in the match,” Courier said. “The thing is, we’re not used to seeing our heroes so vulnerable.”

Maybe Federer, whose footwork evokes ballet, whose Swiss-taught linguistic skills are the envy of many, was rewarded by the tennis gods for being an open man, for sharing with the world how much he cares.

How else to explain the divine parting of the draw as the world’s best players went down, especially Nadal to an overachieving Soderling in the fourth round? Then rain slowed the red clay court in the hours before the final, blunting Soderling’s power, favoring Federer’s movement and variety.

Unbreakable on serve, fierce with his forehand, dead-on with his drop shot, Federer was threatened only in the second set when Soderling served himself into a tie breaker. Federer then came up aces on the four balls he served.

“When there was a chance to make it a match, you saw what he did,” Rod Laver said from his Southern California home. “Amazing, the other guy didn’t put his racket on one ball.”

Three years ago, Laver presented Federer the trophy in Melbourne after career slam No. 7.

“I shook his hand, gave him the trophy, he went to the mic and couldn’t get any words out,” Laver said. “Afterward, when we were inside, he gave me a hug and said, ‘I’m sorry, I couldn’t help it.’ But I was touched by how much it meant to him, by how much of a historian he is, how much he knows about the years that I played.”

Even if Federer never wins again, Sampras is already out of the greatest-of-all-time discussion. He never so much as made a French final. But what about Laver? He won a Grand Slam as an amateur, another as a professional. In between, he lost five years of eligibility in Grand Slam tournaments, limiting his career victory total to 11.

“It’s not Roger’s fault that Laver didn’t play five years,” Ivan Lendl said Sunday in a telephone interview. “But I’ve been thinking about this for a long time and I think the only conclusion you can reach right now is to split it — Federer in the modern era and Laver from 1968 and back. But if Roger wins the next two or three, well, maybe you give it to him.”

This is not just a news media debate, Courier and Lendl said. Players of all generations want to weigh in. And with few exceptions, count on the sport continuing to root for Federer to climb higher up the mountain of immortality, as it has championed him since he rocketed to the top with the beautiful game and the embraceable persona.

Even Soderling, who by reputation shuns discourse with most players, became a humble charmer during the awards ceremony, paying his respects.

“You really gave me a lesson on how to play tennis,” he told Federer.

They were joined by Andre Agassi, the trophy presenter and the last man to complete the career slam, in Paris 10 years ago. In the presence of another great, in perhaps his most rewarding hour, you knew Federer would get in the flow.

The ceremonial first tear escaped during the playing of the Swiss national anthem, down his left cheek, followed by more. Finally, the French Open was played Sunday by Roger’s rules, No. 1 being: there is crying in tennis.

300 2009-06-09 The Vatican has made it easier for bishops to dismiss from the priesthood and release from celibacy rules those priests who have been living with women, abandoned their ministry or engaged in sexually inappropriate behavior, the Catholic News Service has reported.

They do not apply to priests who have been found to have sexually abused minors.
301 2009-06-09 Apple also announced it would sell the previous eight-gigabyte iPhone 3G for a price of $99, reduced from $199, on top of data and voice plans. That could make the iPhone accessible to cost-conscious consumers and undercut competitors like Palm. Palm’s new smartphone, the Pre, which went on sale Saturday, costs $199 after a mail-in rebate. Sprint, which is selling the Pre exclusively, offers a two-year service contract that is cheaper than the one AT&T offers for the iPhone.

“This puts a lot of pressure on the likes of RIM and Palm,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company, referring to the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion. “It sorts of upsets Palm’s apple cart two days after the launch of the Pre.”

Apple also used the industry gathering to announce new features and price cuts on its MacBook Pro line of laptops. All new MacBook Pros will feature up to seven hours of battery life — a 40 percent increase from the last version, because of the new lithium-ion batteries Apple is using. The new batteries are sealed into the laptops, as opposed to the removable batteries that have been in previous MacBooks. Apple is saying the power units can be recharged up to 1,000 times — up to three times as much as other batteries. New MacBook Pros will also feature an SD memory-card slot for simpler photo transfers.

The new, lower prices suggest the company is taking aim at recession-wary consumers and is willing to sacrifice at least some profit to increase its share of the market for personal computers.

But Apple did not budge on prices significantly. For example, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro now costs $1,699, $300 less than the previous version.

“I think there was a recognition that their prices are becoming increasingly disconnected from the market,” said Toni Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “But this was not a bold step into new price points.”

AT&T said iPhone owners with existing contracts would have to pay more to upgrade to a new phone: $299 for the eight-gigabyte, $399 for the 16-gigabyte and $499 for the 32-gigabyte. However, current customers who are eligible for upgrades and those whose contracts have expired would pay the same price as a new customer, said Mark Siegel, executive director of media relations for AT&T mobility and consumer markets. The original iPhone was sold two years ago.

TomTom, the maker of GPS systems for cars or personal use, also made a presentation at the conference, in which it said it was introducing a portable navigation application and car kit to provide drivers with turn-by-turn directions. TomTom executives were acknowledging that the iPhone and other smartphones were killing its market for stand-alone GPS hardware and that the company was entering the accessories and applications business.

The new software for the iPhone also pushed the device more clearly into the portable game console arena occupied by Nintendo’s DS and Sony’s PSP. In what looks like another play for the iPhone to resemble a handheld gaming device, the new peer-to-peer connection feature will locate nearby users using Bluetooth and connect the two using Wi-Fi, allowing them to compete in various games.

Much of Apple’s presentation was devoted to software, both for the Macintosh computer and the iPhone. The company said a new version of its operating system for the Macintosh, called Snow Leopard, would be available in September. It will cost $29 for current Mac owners to upgrade and the operating system will be shipped with all new Macs.

Snow Leopard includes new features that include enhanced global search that can now read URLs and text in Web pages; better compatibility with Microsoft Exchange, the dominant e-mail system used in businesses; and faster computing over all.

Apple also said the new version of the iPhone’s operating system, iPhone OS 3.0, will be made available free to current iPhone owners beginning June 17. The software will have more than 100 new features, including capabilities for multimedia messaging; cut, copy and paste tools; and search functions. It will also unlock features developers have eagerly awaited, like the ability to buy virtual goods or new gaming levels within applications.

ScrollMotion, a start-up based in New York, unveiled an application at the convention called Iceberg, a digital bookstore that will let users purchase best sellers from within the application without having to open a browser.
302 2009-06-09 HARTFORD (AP) — Federal agents violated the constitutional rights of four illegal immigrants in raids that New Haven officials say were retaliation for a city program that provided ID cards to foreigners in the country illegally, a federal immigration judge has ruled.

The raids took place in New Haven on June 6, 2007, two days after the city approved issuing identification cards to all city residents, regardless of immigration status, to help immigrants open bank accounts and receive city services. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials denied that the early-morning raids were retaliatory, saying that they started planning them the previous year.

The judge, Michael Straus, said in decisions here last week that the agents entered the immigrants’ homes without warrants, probable cause or consent; he put a stop to deportation proceedings against the four, whose names were not released. Immigration officials said all four are from Mexico, but the defendants cited their Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to say what country they are from.

Two of them lived in one home, and two in a second. They said in affidavits that agents barged into both homes after residents had opened their doors only a little. Using a “target list,” the agents went into the homes looking for specific illegal immigrants, whom they did not find, court documents said.

Immigration officials have denied claims that the 32 arrests made that morning were improper, and said that the people arrested had been ordered by judges to leave the country. They said in court documents that they were allowed into the homes during the raids.
303 2009-06-09 Prices remain well below those of last summer, when the national average for regular gasoline soared above $4, but economists say the recent gains are a growing economic problem and may presage a rise in the overall inflation rate.

“This hits everyone,” said Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale. “It has the potential to affect your confidence.” He said that the recent rise in gasoline prices could effectively offset the new $400 to $800 payroll tax cut most employees are receiving this year as part of the Obama administration’s effort to stimulate the economy.

Consumers last summer were pulling $1.5 billion a day from their wallets to fuel their vehicles. By January, as oil prices collapsed, they were spending only $600 million a day. But now they are back to daily spending of around $1 billion, Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said.

The price increase mystifies some analysts, who say that oil demand remains weak. According to the International Energy Agency, worldwide demand is down 2.6 million barrels a day from last year, mostly because of declines in driving and slower economic activity in the United States and other industrialized countries. Oil inventories are high.

“I’m scratching my head,” said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, who attributes oil’s rise to an influx of investment dollars. “Right now, the sense is the economy is on a path toward improvement, and there is a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines. So hedge funds, sovereign funds, pension funds are investing in futures and oil stocks and commodity indexes.”

Glenn Darden, chief executive of Quicksilver Resources, an independent oil and natural gas producer in Fort Worth, predicted that oil prices would keep rising. “We were below the cost of drilling and production costs, so that situation could not last,” he said. “Oil being at $70 or $80 or $100 a barrel is where it’s going.”

Crude oil settled Monday in New York trading at $68.09 a barrel.

Because of the economic downturn, petroleum refiners around the country slowed gasoline production at the end of last year, and more recently they took extra time to complete the switch from winter to summer fuel blends.

Several refineries in the Midwest had temporary maintenance delays and problems, including at the large BP refinery in Whiting, Ind., which has had to retool its operations to refine fuels from Canadian oil sands.

“You are entering the highest demand season of the year with tight supply, and that supply may not catch up with demand until the fall,” said Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy, a consulting company.

The increase since the beginning of the year has been especially brisk in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, states already hit hard by the decline in the automobile industry and slumping home prices.

“Every penny counts,” said Mayor Valerie Knol of Farmington, Mich., who said that people in her area typically drive long distances for work and do not have ready access to mass transit. She added that the extra money people were spending on gas was money they would otherwise spend going out or buying goods.

Molly Maloney, 17, winced the other day as she pumped $40 worth of gas into her Toyota Camry at a station in Westlake, Ohio, that was selling its regular blend for $2.75 a gallon. She is looking for a job in a tight economy, and the high gas prices are crimping her search.

“I’m just blindly applying to any place that’s close to my house, so I won’t have to drive very far,” she said. “It’s just crazy.”

Experts who follow the auto industry see a silver lining of sorts in the rising prices. The government, which recently bailed out two of the three Detroit carmakers, is pressing the companies to build smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.

“The manufacturers need high gas prices for people to accept those cars,” said Maryann Keller, an automotive consultant. “Gasoline prices motivate behavior.”
304 2009-06-09 Evergreen Investments agreed Monday to pay more than $40 million to settle state and federal regulators’ charges that it overstated the value of one of its mutual funds, which invested in mortgage-backed securities.

The settlement came after the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division accused Evergreen and an affiliate of improperly valuing its Ultra Short Opportunities fund and inflating its worth by as much as 17 percent.

The Evergreen settlement could affect other companies that issued short-term bond funds and suffered steep losses because of investments in risky debt or debt that became largely illiquid. Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and the Morgan Keegan unit of Regions Financial are among fund providers that face lawsuits and arbitration claims because of unexpected claims in short bond funds.

Evergreen did not admit to or deny the findings in the S.E.C. order. Evergreen, a subsidiary of Wachovia at the time of the violations, is now a unit of Wells Fargo.
305 2009-06-09 Hedge funds are beginning to recover from the huge losses they suffered last year, as May turned into one of the best performing months in history.

On average, hedge funds climbed 5.23 percent last month, leaving them up 9.43 percent this year, according to an index of monthly returns compiled by Hedge Fund Research. Major funds including Moore Capital Management, Paulson & Company, SAC Capital Advisors and the Tudor Investment Corporation scored big gains across sectors using nearly all strategies as confidence slowly crept back into the equity and debt markets.

“May has been a remarkably strong month as it relates to hedge fund performance across the board,” said Andrea Gentilini, director of prime services for Barclays Capital. “Even the strategies that have been under severe stress over the course of the last two years have continued to post strong performance.”

One of the most striking turnarounds has been from the Citadel Investment Group, the Chicago-based firm run by the 40-year-old billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. The firm’s flagship Kensington Global Strategies Fund was up 20.37 percent in the first five months of this year after plummeting 54.49 percent last year, according to performance numbers sent to investors.

Mr. Griffin is known for his talents in convertible arbitrage trading, which involves buying securities that convert into a company’s common stock while shorting, or betting against, the shares of the same company. That strategy, which brought Mr. Griffin’s investors immense financial pain last year, has gained 19.48 percent this year, according to the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index.

Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, has also experienced a reversal of fortune. After being down 37 percent last year and being forced to inject $500 million of his personal money into his fund, Mr. Icahn, who manages $5.5 billion, has gained 16 percent this year, according to investors.
306 2009-06-09 Standing on a newly renovated stretch of an elevated promenade that was once a railway line for delivering cattle — surrounded by advocates, elected officials and architects who made the transformation happen — Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg cut a red ribbon on Monday morning to signify that the first phase of the High Line is finished and ready for strolling.

Calling the High Line, which opens to the public on Tuesday, “an extraordinary gift to our city’s future,” Mr. Bloomberg said, “Today we’re about to unwrap that gift.” He added, “It really does live up to its highest expectations.”

The first portion of the three-section High Line, which runs near the Hudson River from Gansevoort Street to West 20th Street, will be open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. There are entrances at Gansevoort Street (stairs) and at 16th Street (elevator); exits are located every few blocks.

The second phase, which extends to 30th Street, is under construction and expected to be completed by fall 2010. The third phase, up to 34th Street, has yet to be approved.

The High Line project is something of a New York fairy tale, given that it started with a couple of guys who met at a community board meeting in 1999 — Joshua David, a writer, and Robert Hammond, a painter — and discovered they shared a fervent interest in saving the abandoned railroad trestle, which had been out of commission since 1980 and was slated for demolition during the Giuliani administration. That began a decade-long endeavor that involved rescuing the structure and enlisting the Bloomberg administration in its preservation and renovation.
307 2009-06-09 Consider it one small step  or a roll, actually  for a robot, one not giant, but significant step for robotics.

Willow Garage, a Silicon Valley robotics research group, said that its experimental PR2 robot, which has wheels and can travel at speeds up to a mile and a quarter per hour, was able to open and pass through 10 doors and plug itself into 10 standard wall sockets in less than an hour. In a different test, the same robot completed a marathon in the company’s office, traveling 26.2 miles. PR2 will not compete with humans yet; it took more than four days.

For the person who wants to buy a fully functioning robot butler, this may not seem so impressive. But for roboticists and a new generation of technologists in Silicon Valley, this is a significant achievement, a step along the way to the personal robot industry.

Willow Garage was founded by Scott Hassan, one of the designers of the original Google search engine. The company’s name is a reference to a small garage on Willow Road in Menlo Park, Calif., which was Google’s first office. The company is trying to develop a new generation of robotic personal assistants. Roboticists here and at other companies envision creating something on the scale of the personal computer industry, with mechanical personal assistants taking over a lot of drudgery, from cleaning up to fetching a beer from the refrigerator.

This is not a new hope, nor is it the first time that robots have tried to open doors, navigate rooms and recharge themselves. The Beast, a robot built at Johns Hopkins University in the mid-1960s, was able to locate standard wall sockets to refuel. And devices like the inexpensive iRobot Roomba vacuum cleaner can locate and dock with a specially designed charging station.

But roboticists said that the Willow Garage robot was the first to integrate the ability to do a number of operations in a real-world environment.

“There are other groups that have opened doors before,” said Andrew Ng, a Stanford roboticist with several students who have gone to work for the company. But, Mr. Ng said, this seemed to be the first robot able to repeatedly and reliably open doors and plug itself in.

William L. Whittaker, a Carnegie Mellon University roboticist and the winner of a Defense Department urban challenge robot driving contest last year, said it was “unprecedented” for a robot to navigate in a building reliably and repeatedly recharge itself. “These guys are the real deal,” he said.

The Willow Garage laboratory is less than a mile from another pioneering mobile robot project that was developed at SRI International in the late 1960s. The robot, known as Shakey, had little onboard computing capability and was remotely controlled by a combination of a mainframe and a minicomputer.

“In 40 years there has been a lot of progress, but not progress you notice,” said Nils Nilsson, a pioneering artificial intelligence researcher who was one of Shakey’s designers. “A lot of the progress has been made in removing the cheats we used.”

To help Shakey navigate, he said, the baseboards in the room were painted black to help identify walls, and objects were painted red so they could be identified by the vision system.

The ultimate goal of the Willow Garage researchers is to build a Robot Operating System, or R.O.S., that would greatly facilitate the work of a generation of software developers.

Microsoft is developing a similar system based on a version of the Windows operating system, but the Willow Garage effort is an open-source project intended to leverage the contributions of a number of robotics experts around the world.

Toward that end, a team of roboticists from the University of Tokyo recently modified the Willow Garage R.O.S. to run on a robot they were developing, said Steve Cousins, Willow Garage’s president and chief executive.

“The eventual goal is to provide a set of capabilities that are so generic and so universal that they can be used as building blocks in more complicated applications,” said Sebastian Thrun, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a Willow Garage board member.

The current PR2 robot is powered by several Intel microprocessor chips and “sees” with a combination of sensors including scanning lasers and video cameras. It is able to locate electrical outlets and navigate in a building that is designed to accessibility guidelines in the Americans With Disabilities act. Such buildings do not have doors with round door knobs, which simplifies the task of opening a door for a robot. The PR2 carries its plug on a magnet at its base.

In the recent test, one of the plugs was behind a locked door, so the robot needed to be intelligent enough to abort its effort and move on to the next plug. The doors it needed to navigate were alternately closed, open and partially open.

One of the scientists summed up his feelings about the milestone in a succinct e-mail message:

“Now they can escape and fend for themselves.”
308 2009-06-09 The word implies the rapid spread of an infectious disease to many countries in different regions, hitting each with more or less the same severity. But in fact, severity varies — not all people are infected at the same time, and not every country need be affected.

And there can be many other factors, including the numbers and percentages of people falling ill and dying; a population’s vulnerability to the disease, based on previous rates of infection; and the quality of health care facilities and disease monitoring systems.

Not least is that scientists do not know precisely how pandemics arise, what fuels them, why they vary in their lethality, why some occur in waves and why they stop.

Health officials have long preached that with influenza, the only sure bet is to expect the unexpected. The new swine influenza virus, which appeared suddenly after years of warning about a potential pandemic of , upset the W.H.O.’s assumptions that most people have the same understanding of the word pandemic.

For years, the organization’s Web site defined an influenza pandemic as causing “enormous numbers of deaths and illness.” But the agency recently pulled the definition, apologizing for causing confusion and .

One of the biggest problems in public health is communicating risk assessment.

and W.H.O. officials say their preparedness plans are intended for governments, not people in the street. Officials bristle at criticism that their messages and plans have led the public to equate the word pandemic with the Spanish influenza of 1918-19, the worst recorded pandemic in history, killing 20 million to 100 million people.

In preparing for the worst, officials have considered milder pandemics, said Dr. Nancy J. Cox, chief of the influenza division at the in .

But Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of at , said that “we, the public health community, deserve to be chided” about the confusion.

“We ought to be able to do a better job in communicating in an understandable way,” he said in an interview.

Scientists like to assert that theirs is an exact discipline. But like the terms “evidence -based medicine” and “peer review,” pandemic turns out to be another example of imprecise vocabulary that doctors use every day, assuming everyone understands their meaning.

Journals, textbooks and reference works use pandemic in discussing certain diseases, but rarely define the word.

For example, the definition section of the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, a standard reference work, includes “endemic” (said of a disease that is usually present in an area or a population group) and “epidemic” (more cases of an illness than would normally be expected) but not “pandemic.”

The disease manual’s editor, Dr. David L. Heymann, a retired assistant director-general of the W.H.O., said the term had not caused confusion in the past, but assured me in an interview that “pandemic will be defined in the next edition.”

Even the indexes of most major medical textbooks do not list pandemic. One is Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, of which Dr. , who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is a main editor.

“It’s a mistake, and I’m surprised it’s not there because it should have been,” Dr. Fauci said in an interview.

Government agencies do not have official lists of pandemics. Textbooks cite many recent and old ones, including these:

¶ . Many experts have called H.I.V. a pandemic. Others disagree, saying the virus is pandemic only in .

¶Cholera. Since 1817, most experts agree, the world has had seven pandemics of this bacterial illness, which causes severe and . ¶Acute hemorrhagic . Beginning in 1969, an enterovirus has caused tens of millions of cases of a highly contagious, acute, painful, but rarely blinding, form of hemorrhagic eye inflammation.

¶Dengue. Since World War II, this mosquito-borne viral disease has spread widely in and Latin America.

¶ . A pandemic of the bacterial disease raced through and Asia after Columbus’s return from America and during mass movements of armies in Europe.

Although pandemics have been classically limited to , the term has spread to noninfectious, chronic ones. For example, many health officials now speak of pandemics of and heart disease.

Knowledge about past pandemics is necessarily incomplete; historical accounts cannot make up for the absence of modern disease monitoring and laboratory tests.

About 14 pandemics of influenza have been described since the 16th century, with the first indisputable one occurring in 1889.

In 1580, an influenza pandemic swept through Asia into Europe within six weeks, and at least 10 percent of Rome’s 81,000 residents died in the first week, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the . Some Spanish cities were almost totally depopulated.

Dr. Morens, of the infectious diseases institute, said his studies of influenza pandemics left a confusing track record and “are rewiring our brains about thinking about influenza.”

“The medical literature will tell you there were three pandemics in the 1830s,” he said — “one from 1830 to 1832, a second in 1833 to 1834 and a third in 1836 to 1837. But I am beginning to think they were all one pandemic.”

Dr. Morens said he was puzzled as to why no influenza pandemics were recorded for nearly 150 years after the one in 1580, although there were some severe localized epidemics.

“A period of pandemic stability makes us wonder whether a pandemic comes at any time by chance,” he said, “or whether something about epidemic situations prevents pandemics,” or at least delays them.

The W.H.O.’s staging system has long been part of its plan for an influenza pandemic. Deep concern about a potential pandemic of the H5N1 avian influenza virus led the organization to convene a large meeting of experts in 2005. Among other things, the experts recommended simplifying the staging system.

A number of doctors ask why health agencies do not declare seasonal influenza a pandemic when it spreads around the world.

But Dr. Osterholm, the expert, said that “you can’t use the terminology for just worldwide transmission, because if you did that, you would say every seasonal year is a pandemic.”

“To me,” he continued, “a pandemic is basically a new or novel agent emerging with worldwide transmission.”

Dr. Keiji Fukuda, an influenza expert who is an assistant director-general at the W.H.O., said in an interview that “as difficult as things are right now,” the problem of defining a pandemic and communicating risk “would be magnitudes worse and more confusing” if the agency had not dealt with AIDS, SARS and avian influenza.

Those experiences prompted new international health regulations and pandemic plans, and allowed critical scientific information to be disseminated quickly, he said.

The process was “painful, sure,” he said. “But you can’t really do anything like this without having some amount of pain.”
309 2009-06-09 Mr. Blair came to the job determined to cement the intelligence chief’s authority over 16 disparate spy agencies, and intelligence experts said that the current dispute with the C.I.A. was a litmus test for whether the White House was willing to back him in this effort.

Mr. Panetta, meanwhile, has tried to calm nerves in Langley, Va., in part by assuring agency employees that he will fight for C.I.A. authorities at the White House. Mr. Panetta, a White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, has close relationships with several of President Obama’s senior aides, including Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.

But it is Mr. Blair who appears to be garnering the support of influential lawmakers, some of whom say they are angry that the C.I.A. has not accepted its reduced role in the intelligence firmament.

“We need to move intelligence away from the cold war mind-set, and the C.I.A. has a problem to some extent accepting that,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee.

Mr. Blair and Mr. Panetta met for the first time just days before Mr. Obama stood with them on a stage in January and announced their nominations. Despite having very different professional backgrounds, they have for the most part developed a cordial working relationship, officials said.

Although Mr. Panetta maintains close ties to some White House officials, it is Mr. Blair who spends more time in the Oval Office, as he sometimes delivers Mr. Obama’s daily intelligence briefing in person. Mr. Blair, a retired admiral, also has known General Jones for years, as the two men ascended to the military’s highest ranks during the same period.

Mr. Blair took over an office born out of the intelligence failures before the Iraq war, and almost since its inception the national intelligence director’s operations have been criticized as being bloated and ineffective. Last year, the inspector general at the national intelligence director’s office issued a withering report criticizing it as unable to end the turf battles that for years plagued the intelligence community and were partly responsible to the failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks.

Even more criticism comes from current and former C.I.A. officials, who often portray the intelligence chief’s office as an unnecessary bureaucracy that gums up machinery in need of streamlining. For their part, officials who work for the director of national intelligence sometime portray the C.I.A. as hidebound, turf-obsessed and insular.

More than a dozen current and former government officials were interviewed for this article, most insisting on anonymity because they were concerned about appearing to try to influence White House officials in the dispute. The fact that the White House has intervened in the matter was first reported by The Associated Press.

Some current and former officials portray the C.I.A. resistance to the May 19 directive as petty, as C.I.A. station chiefs are likely to remain America’s senior intelligence representatives in a vast majority of countries. These officials say nevertheless that in some countries it may be more appropriate for a representative from another agency, like the National Security Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration, to be the senior intelligence representative.

For instance, the National Security Agency, responsible for electronic eavesdropping, has a large listening station in Britain that is part of an extensive eavesdropping partnership between the United States and Britain. Some argue that the national intelligence director’s office should designate an N.S.A. official to coordinate intelligence activities in London.

Other examples that officials raise are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, where a large American military presence might lead the national intelligence director to pick an official from the Defense Intelligence Agency.

But some outside experts criticize Mr. Blair’s decision to take on the C.I.A., especially when the Pentagon still controls large parts of the secret intelligence budget.

“It could be that Blair is picking on the C.I.A. because he knows that he can’t take on the Pentagon, which is by far a bigger player,” said Amy Zegart, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who writes extensively on intelligence matters.

The C.I.A. has insisted for years that the issue is about far more than bureaucratic turf. Some central intelligence officials even threatened to resign in 2005 when John D. Negroponte, then the director of national intelligence, proposed installing an N.S.A. operative as the top American intelligence official in Wellington, New Zealand.

The biggest danger, the C.I.A. has argued, is jeopardizing the relationships between its station chiefs and foreign intelligence operatives that have taken years to cultivate.

Michael V. Hayden, who ran the C.I.A. from 2006 until the end of the Bush administration, often jousted with officials from the national intelligence director’s office over who should be station chiefs. Under the law, Mr. Hayden said, it is the C.I.A.’s duty to manage the United States’ partnerships with foreign spy services, and changing that dynamic might further bewilder allies who already do not understand America’s intelligence bureaucracy.

“When we get a liaison partner coming to Washington, they are already confused about who they should be dealing with here,” he said. “Now, you could be creating that same circumstance in a foreign capital.”
310 2009-06-09 The S.E.C. appoints board members after consulting with the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman. Members may serve two terms, but can remain on the board until successors are named.

When Mr. Cox named Mr. Olson, he gave him the seat that had been held by Kayla J. Gillen, a former official of Calpers, a California public pension fund. Ms. Gillen was given an abbreviated term, forcing her to leave the board much sooner than she otherwise would have. Ms. Gillen is now a top aide to Ms. Schapiro, giving her possible influence in naming the new chairman.

One of the five board seats comes up for appointment each October. Charles D. Niemeier, whose second term expired last fall, remains on the board until a successor is appointed. Ms. Schapiro has considered naming him chief accountant of the S.E.C., but may be prevented from doing so by conflict of interest rules that could bar him from dealing with the board. The second term of Willis Gradison, a former congressman from Ohio, will expire this fall, giving the S.E.C. three seats to fill within months.

One of the three appointees must be a certified public accountant, and the major accounting firms hope that seat will go to someone from the industry.

The board was faced with two major controversies during Mr. Olson’s tenure. One, concerning the rules to be used by auditors in assessing management controls, led to a revised board rule that is supposed to reduce the costs of such audits. But the vast majority of companies in America — those with market values less than $75 million — are still exempted from complying with the rule. The S.E.C. will have to decide whether to force them to comply, or to continue delaying enforcement.

The other issue concerned foreign auditing firms. The law requires the board to inspect firms that audit companies whose securities trade in the United States. The commission has sought to do joint inspections with other countries’ regulators, and has done them in a number of countries, including Britain, Norway and Australia. But the European Commission has sought to block such joint inspections, contending the United States board has no right to inspect European firms.

“We have indicated we can be increasingly reliant” on other regulatory bodies, Mr. Olson said Monday, “but the starting point has to be joint inspections, so we can get to know each other.”

The board also faces a legal challenge to its existence. A conservative legal group and a small auditing firm have contended that under the Constitution, the president — and not the S.E.C. — must appoint board members. An appeals court rejected that suit, but the Supreme Court has agreed to consider the case.
311 2009-06-09 The root problem is money, said Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative of Alabama, a nonprofit law firm that represents poor people and prisoners. The lawyers appointed to represent Mr. Wood in 1994 were entitled to a maximum of $1,000 to prepare for the penalty phase of the trial.

“It ought not be a shock to anyone that you get this kind of defense with that kind of funding,” Mr. Stevenson said. “The poor quality of indigent defense is still the ugliest scar on capital punishment in America.”

Mr. Trotter, who now practices insurance law in Washington, would not discuss the case.

But in a 1994 letter to a colleague, Mr. Trotter said he was anxious and lost. “I have been stressed out over this case and don’t have anyone with whom to discuss the case, including the two other attorneys,” Mr. Trotter wrote.

There was little doubt that Mr. Wood would be convicted, said Cary L. Dozier, the lead lawyer on his defense team.

In September 1993, three weeks before Mr. Trotter was admitted to the bar, Mr. Wood broke into the home of his former girlfriend, Ruby Gosha, and killed her with a shotgun blast to her head while she was sleeping, the authorities said. Soon afterward, according to testimony from a cousin, Mr. Wood admitted to shooting Ms. Gosha, saying he had “blowed her brains out and all she did was wiggle.” Mr. Wood was the father of one of Ms. Gosha’s children.

Mr. Dozier said an acquittal was out of the question once Mr. Wood’s cousin testified. “His cousin basically slammed the door on him,” Mr. Dozier said.

Mr. Dozier added that money had played no role in how the case was handled. “If I was appointed to represent someone,” he said, “I done as well for somebody as if he was a paying client. We did the best we could.”

After the jury found Mr. Wood guilty, it turned to the question of the proper punishment. Mr. Dozier said his young colleague had performed capably in presenting the case for leniency. “I thought Ken had done a good job,” he said.

The defense team had a report that described Mr. Wood as competent to stand trial. The report also noted that Mr. Wood’s I.Q. was “in the borderline range of intellectual functioning” and that he read at a third-grade level.

Mr. Trotter did not pursue that point at the sentencing hearing, though evidence of mental retardation was a factor the jury could have considered as favoring leniency.

“Wood’s counsel were well aware that his intelligence is impaired,” Alabama’s attorney general, Troy King, wrote in the state’s brief filed with the United States Supreme Court in April, “and they made a reasonable strategic decision not to present that evidence.”

After the Supreme Court’s 2002 decision in Atkins v. Virginia, which barred the execution of the mentally retarded, a state judge ruled that Mr. Wood was not retarded. True, the court said, his I.Q. was around 64, less than the score of 70 that Alabama law views as “significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.”

But Alabama, like other states, does not rely solely on I.Q. in determinations about retardation in capital cases. It also looks at whether the defendant possessed fundamental practical skills.

The state judge noted that Mr. Wood had held jobs that used heavy machinery, managed his own money, planned and cooked meals, and subscribed to Hot Rod magazine.

Those findings were drafted by the prosecutors and adopted verbatim by the judge. That curious practice is widespread in Alabama trial courts.

“The problem in Alabama is that there are effectively no state court judicial decisions,” Mr. Stevenson said. “Decisions are made by prosecutors who write orders sometimes over 100 pages that are simply adopted by trial court judges.”

The practice is “subject to criticism,” a state appeals court in Mr. Wood’s case said mildly. But it upheld the determination that Mr. Wood was not retarded for the purposes of Atkins. “Even when the court adopts proposed findings and conclusions verbatim,” the appeals court said, “the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.”

Still, the question of whether Mr. Wood was categorically barred from being executed is different from whether evidence of his mental limitations should have been presented to the jury considering his sentence.

At a hearing on a state-court challenge to Mr. Wood’s death sentence, Mr. Trotter testified that the jury’s 10-to-2 vote had been heartbreakingly close. “I felt like if I could have done just a little more,” he said, “that maybe it could have been 9-to-3, and that that would have been enough.”
312 2009-06-09 KIEV, Ukraine — Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko of Ukraine acknowledged Sunday night that talks to create an alliance between her party and opposition forces in Parliament had collapsed, putting an end to her plan to undercut her former ally, President Viktor A. Yushchenko.

In a televised address, Ms. Tymoshenko said she had hoped to build a broad coalition to address the economic crisis, which has severely affected Ukraine. But she accused the opposition leader in Parliament, Viktor F. Yanukovich, a former prime minister, of betraying her.

“He unilaterally, without warning anyone, quit the negotiation process, making a loud political statement, killing the merger and the chances for Ukraine,” Ms. Tymoshenko said.

She reiterated that she would run for president in the next election, which is likely to be in January.

Her announcement capped several weeks of renewed political intrigue in Ukraine, which has faced instability since the Orange Revolution of 2004 brought to power a pro-Western government led by Ms. Tymoshenko and Mr. Yushchenko.
313 2009-06-09 The theory of herd immunity holds that when most people in a group are vaccinated, everyone is protected  even those who refuse the vaccine, as many families are doing these days out of a belief that vaccinations cause autism and other illnesses. But the theory does not appear to work well with whooping cough.

Researchers studied children enrolled in a Colorado health plan in the period 1996 to 2007, and found 156 laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis. They recorded the vaccination status of each and matched them to 595 randomly selected control subjects. After controlling for sex, age, season of infection and other factors, they found that the unvaccinated children were about 23 times as likely as vaccinated children to get whooping cough. In other words, about 1 in 20 unvaccinated children were infected, compared with 1 in 500 who were vaccinated. The study appears in the June issue of Pediatrics.

“This study is additional information that both doctors and parents can use,” said the lead author, Jason M. Glanz, an epidemiologist with Kaiser Permanente. “Parents need to know the consequences of choosing not to vaccinate.”

Pertussis can cause serious illness, especially in children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than half of infants who get the disease have to be hospitalized, about 1 in 10 get pneumonia, and about 1 in 50 have convulsions. In 2007, there were 10,454 cases of pertussis reported to the C.D.C., and 10 children died.
314 2009-06-09 Meanwhile, stock markets recovered from steep losses only to fall back in the last minutes of trading and closed mixed.

The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down more than 100 points, gained 1.36 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 8,764.49 while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was 0.95 points or 0.1 percent lower. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell the most, down 7.02 points, or 0.38 percent, dragged down by losses in shares of Apple, Yahoo and Google.

“We’re getting some consolidation, but generally, the tone continues to be even better, even during the sell-offs,” said Andy Brooks, head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price, “You wake up Monday, say, ‘Boy that was a good week last week,’ take a little bit off the table, and continue to plow ahead.”

In other financial markets, investors dialed back some recent bets. Surging prices of crude oil and metals like gold and copper fell back. And investors hesitated on recent bets they had made that the dollar would continue to lose ground against other major currencies as the global economy struggled toward a recovery.

Commodities ranging from gasoline to soybeans to cotton and gold have raced higher in recent weeks as investors place bets that an economic recovery is around the corner, and that business will soon need to use more raw materials to increase production and meet rising consumer demand.

Crude oil futures slipped 35 cents, to $68.09 a barrel , and the price of gold fell $9.70, to $952 an ounce. Gold and oil, which are traditional safeguards for investors worried about inflation, have surged as the value of the dollar falls against other currencies and investors grow concerned about record new supplies of Treasury notes hitting the market.

But those moves were reversed as the dollar strengthened against the euro, and the dollar index — which ranks the currency against other major ones — rose to its highest point in two weeks.

As commodity prices retraced some of their climb, companies that make basic materials like chemicals and metals fell the most. Financial companies were down slightly as investors waited for details from the Federal Reserve about whether major banks would be allowed to repay portions of their government bailouts.

Stock markets have raced higher since late winter as the economy finally began to show signs of nearing a bottom, but analysts said that a fevered rally that lifted the S.& P. 500 about 30 percent off its 12-year lows was beginning to cool. Investors are not as worried about a financial calamity, but they are still wary about the economy’s chances for recovery, especially if interest rates spike, home foreclosures pile up and gasoline prices crimp consumer spending.

“Do housing prices stabilize?” said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen Ball & Associates. “Do rates hold here? If mortgage rates go back up, do we have a relapse? The market now is taking a more balanced view. We’re better, but we’re not quite out of the woods yet.”

Even GLG Partners, the hedge fund manager based in London that was hit hard by redemptions and poor returns in 2008, has experienced a turnaround, its funds rising 11 percent for the year, in part because of its large exposure to emerging markets, which have led the global rally.

Hedge fund investors, while still net redeemers as recently as April according to research by Morgan Stanley, are gradually coming back. Their focus has been on funds like those of Mr. Jabre and Mr. Odey that have proved adept enough to position themselves for the market’s recent powerful upswing.

Mr. Jabre has apparently not been hurt by a fine from Britain’s Financial Services Authority in 2006 for £750,000, $1.4 million at the time, for taking excessive risks.

Hedge fund managers caution that the return to the market has been a tentative one, driven more by institutions and less by wealthy individuals, many of whom still bear the scars of huge losses last year.

Moreover, any improved spirits have been tempered by a proposed European law that would impose restrictions and costs on funds operating in London.

Still, after one of the worst six-month stretches ever experienced by the industry, the mood in the Mayfair district of London, where many fund offices are located, is decidedly more upbeat.

Last week, the leading lights of London hedge funds came together at the annual charity dinner organized by Arpad Busson, the prominent fund of funds executive who is better known as Uma Thurman’s fiancé. An estimated £15 million ($24.4 million) was raised, down from £25 million last year, but still more than expected. Guests bid for prizes like Fiat cars decorated by the artist Damien Hirst and trips to Richard Branson’s Virgin Island retreat, a reminder of the flash and glamour that prevailed during the hedge fund boom.

As for the regulatory threat from Europe, funds in London — which have benefited from the British government’s lenient regulatory approach — are up in arms about proposals that would force fund managers to seek regulatory approval for their use of leverage and any material change in investment strategy. They would also be required to use outside agencies to value their funds.

Managers insist that such an intrusion would be calamitous for this industry, whose lifeblood is borrowing and secrecy, and veiled threats have already been aired about a hedge fund exodus, possibly to Switzerland.

Hedge fund managers argue that it was the overuse of leverage by banks, not the hedge funds, that caused the financial crisis. And that view is shared by Britain’s Financial Services Authority.

Hedge funds based in the United States looking to market their own funds in London and Europe would also be affected by the European Union rules, according to Julian Korek of Kinetic Partners, an adviser to hedge funds on compliance and regulatory matters. He says that the new law would force American hedge funds that want to market funds in the European Union to set up their own companies and funds in London.

“This is just fortress Europe and it is anticompetitive,” he said, adding that the law could result in the loss of thousands of jobs in London if managers moved their businesses.

That said, it is unlikely that the British government will stand pat as Europe imposes regulations that take direct aim at this country’s financial services industry, which remains the single largest source of tax revenue.

This week, Paul Myners, the government minister responsible for the City of London, warned against regulatory overreach and said there were a number of flaws in the directive “that needed to be rectified.”

The government is preparing its own report on hedge fund regulation, which is expected soon and is likely to blunt the impact of the proposals coming out of Brussels.

For Mr. Odey and Mr. Jabre, their success has derived largely from their ability to quickly recast their investment outlooks. Last year, Mr. Odey gained notoriety for having been among the most prominent short-sellers of the British banking sector. In February, with bank stocks leading the market down, he began buying Barclays, which hit a low of 50 pence before climbing to 300 last month as fears that it would be nationalized abated.

Mr. Jabre said he reached the conclusion that the markets were pricing in a depression, not a recession. “I just realized,” he said, “the world was not going to end.”
335 2009-06-10 If this doesn’t finally settle the question of whether Anvil is a real band, nothing will: that hard-rocking Canadian group, whose career is chronicled in the documentary “Anvil! The Story of Anvil,” will open for the heavy-metal band AC/DC at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., on July 28, and at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 31, the bands’ publicists said in a statement. Anvil, founded in Toronto in the 1970s, enjoyed a short-lived American success in the 1980s with albums like “Hard ’N’ Heavy” and “Strength of Steel.” The group recently re-entered the cultural consciousness with the “Anvil!” documentary, directed by the screenwriter Sacha Gervasi, though the movie has also prompted the occasional (mistaken) conclusion from viewers that the band is an elaborate, Spinal Tap-style hoax. “Anvil! The Story of Anvil” is scheduled for a DVD release this fall.
336 2009-06-10 His comments raised eyebrows in Moscow, where commentators have been predicting his ouster for months. The ruling body of United Russia will convene on Wednesday, and could rebuke or expel Mr. Rakhimov, whose presidential term expires in 2011.

The issue puts the party in a delicate position, since a harsh response would “inflict irreparable damage to United Russia’s image as the party reflecting the interests of the regions,” wrote Alexei Mukhin, director of the Center for Political Information, an independent research organization, on the Web site Polit.ru.

Over the decade since Mr. Putin came to power, Moscow has stripped away regional autonomy, chiefly by abolishing the direct election of governors (in Bashkortostan, one of Russia’s 21 ethnic republics, the position is called president).

A handful of regional strongmen like Mr. Rakhimov survived the transition, by virtue of their popularity or the power of their political machines, and each of them has tested the Kremlin by pressing for more autonomy. But the financial crisis has made it riskier to fire these heavyweights.

Russia’s leaders “cannot govern from the center now,” said Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “If there is a problem, there is no money to pour over it. This raises a huge dilemma: Do they expand the circle of decision makers, and share part of the authority with those who have the regions in control?”

Mr. Rakhimov’s comments did not seem to leave much room for compromise.

“Some changes must definitely be made,” he told the newspaper. “We are going back in the direction we came from.”

He added: “We could live all right in Soviet times, when people said, ‘At least there is no war.’ But with that approach, we will never build a normal civil society or a legal state.”

Mr. Rakhimov is not a model democrat. Russian human rights organizations have criticized him for police crackdowns and heavy-handed control of business and politics in Bashkortostan, which borders western Kazakhstan. His son, Ural, owns many oil-processing facilities and has become one of Russia’s richest men.

Several opposition commentators theorized that Mr. Rakhimov had spoken out sharply because he knew he would lose his post anyway.

But they did not let that detract from their enjoyment.

“We should celebrate the fact that another radical opposition figure has showed up in Russia, who is not afraid to tell truth directly to power,” commented a journalist, Matvei Gonopolsky, on the radio station Ekho Moskvy. “It is not important why a man tells the truth. It is important that he is telling it. Even if he has one foot over the abyss.”
337 2009-06-10 In 2002 the video artist Molly Davies revisited and began documenting the performers and places of the Triangle Arts Program. The project, in 1994 and 1997, brought together a choreographer and a producer from each of three countries — Indonesia, Japan and the United States — for a month of intensive, process-based work. The idea was that the final product would not be as important as the creative give and take.

Ms. Davies’s installation, “Traditions, Inventions, Exchange,” a co-presentation of Danspace Project and the Baryshnikov Arts Center, where it opened on Thursday night, is an attempt to distill a portion of that artistic interplay. Directed by Ms. Davies in collaboration with Iki Nakagawa, the three-part video and sound installation is shown on a continuous loop in two studios, with the United States in one room, and Indonesia and Japan in the other. Each screen shows three moving images.

At times the installation resembles an advertorial for the Triangle Arts Program. Videos segments focusing on Japan and Indonesia compete with each other for attention (with Japan usually winning, simply because the acoustics are better). Footage of exotic scenery is shown alongside glimpses of dancers working in the studio.

While the Japanese collective Nibroll is shown in performance, a critic talks about how contemporary Japanese choreographers have little reverence for history; he refers to them as “post-historical artists.” What follows are close-ups of pink blossoms.

The Indonesia film, in its depiction of both scenery and performances, takes greater commitment to watch. While there are potentially intriguing moments (a healing ritual dance, for instance), the footage and the sense of peering into an exotic artistic process are fairly opaque. Each video is meant to wash over the viewer in broad strokes, but what remains reveals less about art and more about location — and food, which often looks more appealing than the dancing.

Perhaps because an exotic edge is missing, the United States segment, directed solely by Ms. Nakagawa, is the most enticing. Compositionally, she has a knack for juxtaposing images, whether it’s of a cat stretching on its back, a train zipping by a mountaintop or Mr. Paxton performing his “Goldberg Variations.”
338 2009-06-10 Chrysler appeared poised to emerge from bankruptcy by early Wednesday after the United States Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear a challenge by three Indiana state funds and several consumer groups to the sale of most of its assets to Fiat.

The refusal by the Supreme Court to revisit the matter, after two lower courts approved the sale, removes the uncertainty posed by a decision by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Monday to halt the deal temporarily pending further review.

The decision by the Supreme Court, disclosed in a two-page order, made it clear that the justices were not ruling on the merits of the challenge by the Indiana funds, which had protested the government’s treatment of Chrysler’s secured lenders.

Instead, according to the order, the Indiana funds “have not carried the burden” of proving that the Supreme Court needed to intervene. “We are gratified that not a single court that reviewed this matter, including the U.S. Supreme, found any fault whatsoever with the handling of this matter by either Chrysler or the U.S. government,” the Treasury Department said in a statement.

“The Supreme Court really looks at big-picture issues with long-term dimensions,” said Evan D. Flaschen, the chairman of the financial restructuring group at Bracewell & Giuliani. “It’s clear they said, ‘we’re not commenting on the merits of Chrysler, and that this isn’t the type of case where we need to step in to clarify the law.’ ”

A Chrysler spokesman said in a statement that “we’re very pleased with the court’s decision and look forward to closing the transaction very shortly.”

In a statement, Richard Mourdock, Indiana’s treasurer, said he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s order adding, “The future ramifications of the court’s decision on the capital markets remain to be seen.”

In spite of the delay by the Supreme Court, Chrysler’s trip through bankruptcy has been astonishingly quick, taking a little over a month. The Obama administration had promised the reorganization would be efficient.

Even as Chrysler and Fiat awaited the Supreme Court’s decision, their advisers prepared the paperwork to close the deal as soon as possible. They plan to complete the transaction by 9 a.m. Wednesday, when the government wires money to finance the sale, according to people briefed on the matter.

Under the Fiat deal, Chrysler will cut its labor costs and debt levels, as well as gain a partner skilled in making and selling small, fuel-efficient cars around the world. Under the government-backed plan, the carmaker would emerge from bankruptcy with a union retiree trust owning 55 percent, Fiat owning a 20 percent share that could eventually grow to 35 percent, and the United States and Canadian governments holding minority stakes.

Now Chrysler must contend with a brutal market place, with Americans largely shunning new cars. It also faces a potentially formidable foe: G.M., itself trying to slim down through a government-sponsored reorganization.

Chrysler won an additional concession on Tuesday, when a federal judge approved its request to terminate 789 dealer franchises immediately, a move the company said would significantly cut costs.

The decision, by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan, overruled objections by scores of dealers.

Throughout its bankruptcy proceedings, Chrysler argued that it needed to close its deal with Fiat as quickly as possible. Lawyers for the company argued that it was burning through more than $500 million a week, as its plants sat idle and its suppliers needed payments to stay afloat.

The Indiana funds represent teachers and police officers and hold $42.5 million of Chrysler’s $6.9 billion in secured debt.

The funds have argued that they are receiving less compensation for their holdings  29 cents on the dollar  than unsecured creditors like the United Automobile Workers, upsetting bankruptcy law. They have also argued that the government overstepped the bounds of a federal bailout by giving Chrysler money meant for banks.
339 2009-06-10 But the deal has add-ons that dwarf the Zidane transfer. It is reported that Kaká will net $12.7 million per year for six years after . And that his father, Bosco , pockets up to $14 million for acting as his son’s agent.

The actual sums will possibly never be known outside of what Pérez and Leite said to each other. They are like-minded. Each has a degree in civil engineering, each a passion for soccer.

Kaká, born Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite 27 years ago, is now cast as the first in a possible second generation of Real Madrid galácticos, or superstars. Zidane, the catalyst for the original galácticos bought by Pérez in his previous tenure as the club president, is now an adviser to the re-elected president. Zidane, a Frenchman, is perfectly placed to guide Kaká through the fame and fortune that await him in the capital.

Pérez had been told, by Vanderlei Luxemburgo, a Brazilian he hired and fired as coach five years ago, that “Kaká has the technique of a Brazilian and the physical qualities of a European.”

And Kaká expects to be just the start of the rebuilding of Madrid’s team.

“There is an interesting project now in Madrid,” Kaká said about Pérez on Monday. “He is trying to buy other players, and I think he can make a very offensive team. That’s behind my decision to go to this team.”

’s Cristiano Ronaldo, Bayern Munich’s Franck Ribéry, ’s David Villa and, possibly, Liverpool’s Xabi Alonso could also be on the move.

Pérez, who played amateur soccer until his mid-40s, seems to have developed a formula to profit by whatever he spends. He gives the stars he signs a 50-50 deal on their commercial image rights. Whatever Madrid can make by marketing them around the world is shared between club and individual.

This was the deal with Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and , and it made them richer as brands than as players.

Almost unnoticed as Monday turned to Tuesday was the fact that Kaká is tied to . Madrid, too, is backed by Adidas.

No one seemed to find it incongruous that Kaká, as he sat before the news media in Recife, was still in his Brazilian national shirt, the shirt provided by the Brazilian federation’s main paymaster, .

Nor did anyone raise with Kaká his words to the same journalists seven days earlier.

“I will say it one last time,” Kaká said then. “I do not want to leave . I don’t want to be misinterpreted or, worse, manipulated. I just want to say to the millions of Rossoneri fans that I have made my choice. I want to stay. Just leave me alone, please.”

It was too late for that. His father was in Madrid, bartering with Pérez and Adriano Galliani, the Milan chief executive. Days later, Kaká announced he was not staying, after all.
340 2009-06-10 “I think that the company now has a chance, particularly where jobs are concerned, and possibly in conjunction with others like Metro,” Mrs. Merkel said.

Still, the filing leaves Primondo and Quelle, Arcandor’s two mail-order businesses, in limbo alongside Karstadt, a venerable brand with 89 stories in Germany. Its flagship store is the Kaufhaus des Westens in Berlin, the largest department store on the Continent.

Metro, one of the world’s largest retail conglomerates, says it is interested in roughly 60 of Karstadt’s locations.

By letting Arcandor slide into bankruptcy, Mrs. Merkel is betting that the right mixture of commercial momentum and a shift in the political climate against corporate bailouts will protect her from the fallout that would normally come from the insolvency of a company with 43,000 employees.

Mrs. Merkel’s government last month gave 1.5 billion euros in loan guarantees to save the European operations of General Motors, whose main component is the German unit, Opel. The episode prompted a resignation threat from her conservative economy minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, who has criticized the repeated bailouts of banks and other companies.

The Christian Democrats, Mrs. Merkel’s rightist political party, have also hemorrhaged support to the Free Democrats, a business-friendly party, over repeated state interventions. Germans will go to the polls in national elections on Sept. 27.

A rescue fund of 115 billion euros created by the German government in March was meant to help companies that can plausibly claim that the shock of the financial crisis — rather than management missteps — created a cash need.

Roughly 1,300 companies have applied, creating the impression of a long gravy train for the country’s corporate elite, since only companies with sales of more than 500 million euros a year can apply.

That group includes Porsche, the debt-laden sports car manufacturer, which wants 1.75 billion euros.

Arcandor missed out on the money because a review committee determined it had already had financial problems linked to the long decline of department stores in Europe. (Until last year, Arcandor was run by Thomas Middelhoff, who is a director of The New York Times Company)

A poll last week by the Forsa Institut in Berlin showed 68 percent of Germans opposed to a rescue of Arcandor, and only 23 percent for it, higher than margins even a few weeks earlier.

“Somewhere deep down people have a pretty shrewd sense of what is right and what is wrong,” Manfred Güllner, Forsa’s director, said. “They don’t expect that the state does everything and they don’t want to pay for the mistakes.”

Bankruptcy experts said the case of Arcandor might turn out to be the biggest test of a 10-year-old insolvency law, which took effect on Jan. 1, 1999, and aimed to smooth the way for company reorganizations in the fashion of Chapter 11 filing in the United States, thus avoiding outright liquidation.

Bankruptcy carries a stigma because it puts the interests of creditors far ahead of any societal interest in keeping the company afloat.

“In the United States, bankruptcy was always about protecting the debtors, which was logical enough since creditors often sat in London,” said Detlef Specovius, an insolvency specialist at the law firm Schultze & Braun.

The new law tweaked that balance in favor of debtors, but it is still used in only 2 or 3 percent of bankruptcy cases, experts said. Experts said Arcandor was far larger than most companies that had used the law.

But the mere possibility that Arcandor could emerge from bankruptcy, even if under a different name, created an opening for Mrs. Merkel to suggest that the company should find a deal with its creditors first.

“I see a political burden-relieving effect of the insolvency law in Germany,” said Christoph Paulus, dean of the law faculty at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

362 2009-06-11 Re “Not All Abortions Are Equal,” by Ross Douthat (column, New York Times on the Web, June 9):

The reason for a constitutional right to an abortion — and to free speech and to due process — is not that “where there are exceptions, there cannot be a rule.” It’s that the only way to keep the exceptions narrow is to start with a strong right, and let the courts define its boundaries through “reasonable distinction-making.”

The courts do take note of the popular will when they survey state laws to discern the evolving standards of decency, and over the years they have fashioned “saner, stricter legal regimes” for many seemingly clear-cut constitutional rights. They’re fully capable of doing the same for abortion.

There’s a special aspect to criminalizing abortion, or certain kinds of abortion, that may not exist for other actions we deem crimes. For all such actions (like killing or assault or taking property), we recognize that there are exceptional defenses and/or mitigating circumstances (like self-defense, provocation or mistake). But when Roe v. Wade was decided, women justifiably (to my mind, and in retrospect) felt that leaving the assessment of defenses or mitigating circumstances to the mostly male judges, juries or legislators of the day seemed, in all probability, merely to perpetuate an unknowing and uncaring system and therefore its unjust results.

Many today may not recall, but a question much bruited about at the time was “What do women really want?,” as if we had discovered a tribe previously unknown to man — which, in a way, we were and are. In those circumstances, there was no other way to protect a right that women (again I say, with great justification) thought only they could appreciate and enforce, than to enshrine it in the Constitution.

As a lawyer, I appreciate the constitutional, other legal and political problems that such a choice imposed on the nation, and I look forward to the time when women can entrust this most inherently feminine issue to the general population and its political processes. Do you think that time is now?

Ross Douthat presents no argument for thinking that appealing to “the democratic process” is the appropriate way to adjudicate reproductive rights. He alleges that “if abortion were returned to the democratic process, this landscape” — who may get an abortion, and under what circumstances — “would change dramatically.” No doubt it would.
363 2009-06-11 As Washington debates an overhaul of health care, many small businesses are vehemently opposed to the idea of requiring employers to help pay for their workers’ medical coverage.

But at least one small-business group says the proposals now being considered by the Obama administration and Senate leaders could save small companies tens of billions of dollars a year in health care costs  even if there is a mandate for employer coverage.

An analysis by the group, the nonprofit Small Business Majority, to be released Thursday, concludes that the changes would be better for small employers than continuing the current system, which leaves many of those businesses struggling to afford health benefits for their workers. Half of companies with nine or fewer workers do not currently provide employee coverage.

“Small businesses want to be part of the system,” said John Arensmeyer, the group’s chief executive. “They don’t want to shirk their responsibilities.” But “we need comprehensive reform,” he added. “The entire system needs to be fixed.”

Founded in 2005 by executives of small companies who wanted to broaden the small-business discussion about health reform, the group was among those recently invited to the White House to discuss the issues. Mr. Arensmeyer said any mandatory coverage requirements would have to address the inability of some businesses to pay for the contributions. “This doesn’t work in the short term without some assistance to the smallest and least profitable businesses,” he said.

The analysis, conducted by Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who helped advise Massachusetts on its overhaul of health insurance, examines proposals being discussed by the Senate Finance Committee and others in which small companies would have to pay some portion of their payroll toward health benefits but would also receive some form of tax credits to defray the expense.

Small businesses would save in two major ways, Mr. Gruber said. Because small companies traditionally pay much more than large corporations for the same coverage for an employee, they would benefit from proposals streamlining the purchase of insurance and lowering the administrative expenses associated with the policies. The companies, he said, would also benefit from the success of any legislative efforts to contain the rapidly escalating cost of health care.

Over all, the study estimates that the proposals under debate could save small businesses anywhere from $546 billion to $855 billion over the next decade.

If nothing is done, on the other hand, the study says the health care bill for small businesses  estimated at $156 billion this year  would more than double, to $339 billion in 2018.

But some small-business groups still worry that the proposals now being floated could do more harm than good.

The National Federation of Independent Business, an association of small companies, says many of its members do not favor forcing companies to pay a significant share of the cost of employee health coverage.

Susan Eckerly, senior vice president of federal public policy for the federation, said her group was concerned that the proposed measures could fail to contain the high costs of medical care, which she said was a main concern for small businesses.

“Adding new, additional burdens to small-business owners  especially in the form of an expensive mandate  is not an effective approach to reform,” Ms. Eckerly said. “In fact, it burdens the very people we are supposed to be trying to help.”

Reducing overall costs is a critical piece of any proposal, Mr. Arensmeyer agreed. “Nobody wants anyone to pay into a broken system.”
364 2009-06-11 CHICAGO — Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois appointed a panel on Wednesday to investigate accusations that the University of Illinois admitted hundreds of applicants based largely on their political connections.

Mr. Quinn said the Admissions Review Commission would look into 800 applicants who, as first reported by The Chicago Tribune, won spots at the university’s Urbana-Champaign campus after intervention from state lawmakers and university trustees. The Tribune said these students, whose names appeared on an internal list, were admitted even though some did not meet the university’s admission standards.

“We want to make sure that the taxpayers, parents and students of Illinois know there is no kind of special process where individuals who have less qualifications are admitted because of their political influence or clout,” Mr. Quinn, a Democrat, said. The University of Illinois, which has three campuses, is considered the state’s most prestigious public university.

The commission, which is to complete its work in 60 days, will be led by Abner Mikva, a retired federal judge and former state legislator and congressman, who had been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Mr. Mikva said the panel should not be as concerned about meting out punishment as with ensuring that any patronage influence in the university’s admission practices would not be tolerated.

“You can’t just criticize the politicians, because they will only push as hard as the institution allows,” Mr. Mikva said. “We certainly don’t want to weed out kids, but on the basis of the university’s grading policy, they will see which ones merit retention.”
365 2009-06-11 In recent weeks, Mr. Berlusconi has been in hot water over his own alleged cadre of women, specifically the nature of his relationship with an 18-year-old. The intense scrutiny was seen as costing his coalition several percentage points in last weekend’s elections for the European Parliament, which it won anyway.

On Wednesday, it was back to business.

Colonel Qaddafi arrived with a provocation pinned to one lapel of his baggy military uniform: a black-and-white photograph of a Libyan resistance leader, Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the Italians in 1931.

“This hanging is like the crucifixion of Christ for Christians,” Colonel Qaddafi said at the news conference. “For us, this image is a bit like the cross that some of you wear.”

But Italy had practical goals in mind. The financial crisis has led Italian blue-chip companies like the bank Unicredit and the energy utility ENI to rely more on Libyan investment.

So in exchange for the $5 billion in reparations it is due to receive over 20 years, Libya will provide Italy with more oil, make it easier for Italian companies to conduct business there and place Italian companies “in first place” to win infrastructure contracts, Mr. Berlusconi said.

Mr. Berlusconi also praised Libya for cracking down on illegal immigration from its shores.

Colonel Qaddafi, meanwhile, offered ruminative remarks on colonialism and migration. He said that Italians should understand “the appeal of Europe” to many Africans. “They have no identity,” he said. “They come out of the forest, they say, ‘In the North there’s money, I’ll go to Libya and then to Europe.’ ”

Currently president of the African Union, Colonel Qaddafi has ruled Libya since 1969. Credentials distributed at Wednesday’s news conference referred to him as “the leader of the revolution.”

He has not exactly received a hero’s welcome. After politicians on the left protested Libya’s human rights record, Colonel Qaddafi’s address to Italian senators was shifted to a nearby building from the Senate floor.

Students have protested his planned speech at La Sapienza University, and the Jewish community has also grumbled about the colonel’s visit. Many Jews fled to Italy after being expelled from Libya in 1967, and many of them are asking for restitution for their confiscated property.

In Rome, Colonel Qaddafi has pitched his Bedouin tent in a public park, the Villa Doria Pamphili.

At his request, on Friday he is expected to meet with 700 Italian women from the business and cultural sectors, an encounter organized by the equal opportunities minister.
366 2009-06-11 Jonathan Rubinstein, a former Apple executive behind its iPod, was named chief executive of the smartphone maker Palm on Wednesday.

Mr. Rubinstein will succeed Ed Colligan, who is stepping down after 16 years with Palm.

The appointment, effective Friday, comes just days after Palm introduced the $199 Pre, a well-regarded rival to Apple’s blockbuster iPhone. One of Pre’s signature features is that it syncs with the iTunes music store just like an iPod or iPhone.

Mr. Rubinstein, 52, will remain chairman, a post he assumed in October 2007 to help bring innovation back to the company. He said in a statement he was excited about his expanded role.

“With Palm webOS we have 10-plus years of innovation ahead of us, and the Palm Pre is already one of the year’s hottest new products,” he said.

Sprint, the exclusive carrier for the Pre, said the phone’s weekend introduction broke first-day and first-weekend sales records for a Sprint device.

Palm said Mr. Colligan, who had also served as president, plans to take some time off before joining a private equity firm, Elevation Partners, in Menlo Park, Calif.

Mr. Rubinstein began at Apple in 1997 as a senior vice president for hardware engineering. He helped lead the introduction of the iMac and later led the iPod division.
367 2009-06-11 Creditors of Delphi complained this was too sweet a deal, and one that reduced what they might recoup. Further, they said the deal was negotiated secretly without a proper auction. And they seemed to be saying that they would have committed cash in place of Platinum, given the opportunity. If creditors really are willing to match or beat Platinum’s deal, that suggests the process left something to be desired.

Now that Delphi has to conduct an auction, it’s not clear whether Platinum, the creditors or another bidder will win the day. But it’s a sign that President Obama’s auto sector operatives are sometimes playing close to the line.

The government’s bank bond guarantee plan has been a big success. The plan, or the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, has backstopped nearly $350 billion of bank debt with maturity up to three years. Now, healthy banks — and even the struggling Citigroup — are able to tap the capital markets without the government’s help. The strongest are even wriggling free of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Now, there’s no remaining need for the bond guarantee program, and officials should wind it down. Though it is set to expire in October anyway, that is already an extension of its original sell-by date this month. And the government has prolonged the life of most of its emergency liquidity programs so far.

Why would it do so? The main problem is that it appears to be suffering from a bit of mission creep. For example, the government recently used it to support debt issued by GMAC, the car and home lender, which is afflicted by more than just capital market dislocations.

GMAC is the first junk-rated company to use the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s guarantee program. If officials see the bank program as a back-door bailout mechanism for companies with chronic problems like GMAC, it will be harder to end. That’s a problem, because the program distorts capital markets and puts taxpayer money at risk.

Healthier banks, meanwhile, have already cut back on their use of the bond guarantee program. A mere $9.5 billion in guaranteed debt was issued last month, according to Dealogic. Banks can now issue bonds on their own, and some may have borrowed as much as they can or need under the plan. Also, bankers worry that Congress might impose retroactive requirements on participants, the way it did on banks that took the money in the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Perhaps GMAC’s participation will end up being a good thing. As healthier banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are supplanted by troubled firms like GMAC, it could cast a stigma over new issues, making them more of a signal of distress. That could dry up participation in the program, leaving no excuses for keeping it going.
368 2009-06-11 While Chrysler and General Motors appear to be speeding through bankruptcy, Delphi, the beleaguered auto parts maker, keeps hitting rough patches.

The latest came on Wednesday, when a federal judge ordered Delphi to open its sales process to other possible bidders, paving the way for alternatives to a deal struck last week with Platinum Equity, a private equity firm specializing in turnarounds.

The judge, Robert D. Drain of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, said that Delphi also needed to release more information about the Platinum deal, which was announced June 1, so that other lenders could decide whether they wanted to make counterbids.

Judge Drain also gave interim approval to a $250 million injection of financing from Delphi’s one-time parent, G.M.

The brewing battle over the Platinum deal is the latest hurdle for Delphi in a reorganization that has lasted nearly four years. During an often contentious four-hour hearing, a lawyer for Delphi, John W. Butler Jr., defended the agreement with Platinum as “the one feasible transaction we’ve had” since last year.
369 2009-06-11 SAN FRANCISCO — In the end it was not her comments on same-sex marriage or the seminude photos that got Carrie Prejean fired as Miss California USA. It was the workload.

Ms. Prejean, the smiling blond Southern Californian, a runner-up in the national competition who became a conservative pinup after stating her opposition to same-sex marriage in the tense closing moments of the 2009 pageant, was fired Wednesday by pageant organizers, including Donald Trump, who cited dereliction of duties.

“This was a decision based solely on contract violations,” Keith Lewis, the executive director of Miss California USA said in a statement, citing Ms. Prejean’s truancy at required public appearances. “It has become abundantly clear that Carrie is unwilling to fulfill her obligations.”

The move to remove came a month after Mr. Trump, the co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, which produces the Miss USA pageant, had stood alongside a teary Ms. Prejean and said she would keep her tiara.

His comments on Wednesday were less supportive. “I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.
370 2009-06-11 After two relatively subdued programs at Alice Tully Hall last weekend, the Silk Road Project, celebrating its 10th anniversary and Lincoln Center’s 50th, pulled out all the stops on Tuesday evening in a free concert at the Damrosch Park band shell. Lincoln Center estimates that 3,500 listeners braved the threatening weather, which in the end produced only a few late sprinkles, and the event was telecast as part of the PBS series “Live From Lincoln Center.”

Much of the interest undoubtedly stemmed from the star power of the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the artistic director of the Silk Road Project, a performing and educational enterprise devoted to musical globalization and named for the ancient trade route between Eastern Asia and Western Europe. But the beauty of the project is that it has from the start attracted international performers whose musical virtuosity and personal charisma rival those of Mr. Ma, who often takes a back seat.

Such performers abounded on Tuesday. In addition to the already glittery weekend cast — Wu Man, Wu Tong, Kojiro Umezaki, Dong-Won Kim, Sandeep Das, Alim Qasimov and Fargana Qasimova — Kayhan Kalhor, the Iranian master of the kamancheh, a Persian string instrument with a wiry timbre, performed and led his “Blue as the Turquoise Night of Neyshabur” (2000), one of the first and most enduring works composed for the project. And Cristina Pato, a flamboyant Galician bagpiper, energized raucous music from Osvaldo Golijov’s “Air to Air” (2006), which was largely inspired by her first encounter with the project, in a workshop.

She was challenged in the Golijov by Wu Tong’s lively squawking on the sheng (Chinese mouth organ complete with pipes). Wu Tong also revealed his versatility, first playing a bawu (Chinese bamboo flute) in the opening “Silk Road Suite,” with Mr. Umezaki on shakuhachi (Japanese bamboo flute) and Mr. Kim, a Korean drummer and vocalist. Then Wu Tong sang a fetching Chinese love song by Zhao Lin, accompanied by Mr. Ma.

Wu Man brought her familiar, astounding virtuosity on pipa (Chinese lute) to a solo number in the suite. Mr. Das, playing tabla (Indian drums), led a battery of percussionists in his “Shristi” (2006), based on a tale of creation involving Shiva and his drum.

Mr. Qasimov and his daughter, Ms. Qasimova, the stars of the tragic Azerbaijani opera “Layla and Majnun” on Saturday, turned their vocal artistry to livelier matters in two songs. And the ensemble repeated an encore from Saturday, Mohammed Abdel Wahab’s “Night at the Caravanserai.”

Guest artists included percussionists from the University of Michigan and string players from the Manhattan School of Music, though the added strings barely registered in the crude and unbalanced amplification of “Blue as the Turquoise Night.”
371 2009-06-11 Apple’s iPhoto software lets you easily organize and edit pictures on your Mac, but the program can sometimes get a little erratic over time, especially with large photo libraries. If you find the program displaying your photo thumbnails as gray rectangles, acting sluggish or generally misbehaving, take a look at iPhoto’s built-in maintenance tools. Using these, you can rebuild the program’s database, thumbnails and file permissions — and also recover unused space from the iPhoto database.

Before you start, though, back up iPhoto’s contents, either with a standard system backup or by burning the library to discs to make sure you have copies of your photos tucked away. Use the Mac’s Software Update feature (found under the Apple menu) to make sure iPhoto has all the latest patches and updates.

Then, start up iPhoto while holding down the Command and Option keys until a box appears onscreen asking if you’d like to rebuild the iPhoto library and perform other maintenance tasks. Check off the tasks you want to use and click Rebuild. It may take a while, but iPhoto should be much better behaved.

372 2009-06-11 Arcade Publishing, a venerable independent literary house that has published authors including Octavio Paz, Raymond Chandler, Ingmar Bergman and Shimon Peres, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company, founded by the husband-and-wife team Richard and Jeannette Seaver, stumbled after Mr. Seaver died in January. The filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York listed more than 200 creditors and liabilities of just over $6 million. Mr. Seaver was a literary hero who, while at Grove Press, another small independent publisher, defied social pressures and censorship to publish works by D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller and William S. Burroughs. At Arcade, he and Ms. Seaver continued to bring international and often underexposed writers to the attention of American readers. One of Arcade’s biggest creditors is Little, Brown, the publishing company owned by Hachette Book Group that distributed Arcade’s books.
373 2009-06-11 Even standing still, Richard, Emir Gloucester, seems to exist in a blur of perpetual motion. Played by Fayez Kazak in “Richard III: An Arab Tragedy,” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, this rising political star in a 21st-century Persian Gulf state is a compact, handsome figure who wears his crisp officer’s uniform with no visible trace of the physical deformity he is said to have.

What’s freakish about him is his supercharged metabolism, that sense of synapses popping like an endless string of firecrackers. When he smiles, which he does often and intensely, he seems to be savoring his own inexhaustible energy and its potential as a weapon of mass destruction. The poor guy hasn’t calculated that when the bomb that is Richard of Gloucester finally fully detonates, it will blow him, as well as his victims, to smithereens.

The man who murders his way to the crown may be the most conspicuous human explosive device on view in Sulayman Al Bassam’s lively and often savagely funny Arabic-language variation on Shakespeare’s “Richard III,” which runs through Friday at the Harvey Theater as part of the academy’s Muslim Voices: Arts and Ideas festival. But he is by no means the only one of his kind. The Kuwait-born Mr. Bassam, who also directed, has created a Richard who is less the scourge of his time than the essence of it, a combustible ruler for a combustible society.

The full title of this production is, after all, “Richard III: An Arab Tragedy,” suggesting that the central tragedy here is cultural instead of individual. Classically Shakespeare’s blood-spattered history play is rendered as a portrait of a singular sociopath, with actors like Laurence Olivier and Ian McKellen digging deep for psyche-warping motives.

None of that for Mr. Bassam (who appeared in several supporting roles in the show’s opening night, after one of his actors was unable to travel at the last moment). The withered limb and hunched back are nowhere to be seen on Mr. Kazak’s Richard, who looks like a dapper blend of Alan Ladd and Omar Sharif. And the character of Richard’s contemptuous, son-spurning mother, long an essential key in Freudian readings of the play, has been eliminated. Most tellingly, Richard is not allowed to begin the evening with his famous, self-reflective monologue.

That honored place goes to Queen Margaret (Amal Omram), the ousted monarch who is mad as hell at having been pushed from power. She arrives solo to deliver a prologue of wrath and dispossession, clutching a suitcase and brandishing a large flag portraying the head of the new king, Edward IV (Monadhil Daood). That she drops the flag and clutches the suitcase says everything about the world she inhabits. Power is fleeting, and everyone, if allowed to live, is destined to become a transient.

From then on the action more or less follows that of Shakespeare’s text. But that introductory image of Margaret, who keeps showing up to curse and gloat and cackle as things go wrong for everybody else, means that Richard can’t highjack our complicity as he traditionally does. He has been placed firmly in a diminishing historical context. We have already been alerted that he can do his Machiavellian worst, but that his time on the world stage will be short.

Not that there’s comfort in this. For Mr. Bassam makes it clear that Richard is just the latest, and not necessarily the most awful, in a succession of tyrants who rule by deception and fear. And the worst, it seems, is yet to come. As Richard woos, finesses, stabs and strangles his way to the top, it appears that there are other, even more powerful forces lurking behind him, waiting to step into the breach. It should surprise no one that these forces speak with an American accent.

Shifting the center of “Richard III” from its title character to the world he inhabits (and that ultimately controls him) means that this production is not one of fine-grained portraiture. Instead it’s a big-picture, energetic satire that, like its chief villain, never stops moving. As designed by Sam Collins, the world that’s summoned here is a runaway hybrid of ancient Arab tradition and 21st-century technology.

Video simulcasts of historic events, narrated by a hard-grinning, uneasy news reporter; projected texts of BlackBerry-sent messages to unseen allies; cellphones used to take pictures documenting temporary (and hypocritical) alliances: all these thoroughly contemporary elements have their role here, and are sometimes deployed to hilarious effect (as in the case of a fixed television text-in poll on Richard’s popularity).

But the Arab music (by Lewis Gibson, performed by an onstage band), which forms a subliminal aural backdrop to the modern power games, has the timeless, propulsive sound of centuries passing to a steady, ominous beat. God is invoked with duplicitous piety, along with apposite quotes from the Koran, by Richard and his allies, but so is the demonizing language of the West, with Richard’s adversaries denounced as terrorists and even members of “an axis of evil.” (The technology-savvy, business-suited Buckingham, played by Raymond el-Hosni, is Richard’s architect in this particular image campaign.)
374 2009-06-11 In the United States, which did not sign the Kyoto pact, a bill that would reduce emissions by 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels recently cleared a Congressional panel. That would be about 6 percent below 1990 levels.

Japan emits less relative to its total output than other major economies. Though Japan has the second largest economy, behind the United States, it ranks fifth in global emissions rankings, trailing the United States, China, Russia and India.

But critics say there is more to be done.

“Japan’s target is not nearly enough to stop the effects of global warming,” said Naoyuki Yamagishi, the head of the climate change program at the environmental advocacy group WWF Japan. “Japan has failed to step up to its international responsibilities,” he said.

Kristian Tangen, a director at Point Carbon, a research and consulting company based in Oslo, said Japan’s goals were “the weakest target any country has pledged so far.”

Japanese businesses argue that their factories are already among the world’s most energy-efficient and that the country will struggle to cut greenhouse gas emissions further. Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japanese companies have pursued technologies that save energy, a drive that has made the country a leader in alternative energy.

Industry leaders also warn that stringent targets for emissions reductions would hurt the frail economy. Japan is in its worst recession since World War II, amid a collapse in global demand for its exports. Last month, industry groups took out a full-page advertisement in the largest daily paper in Japan, warning that steep targets for emissions reductions could hurt economic growth.

“The midterm targets need to be fair to all countries, realistic, and place equal burden on a country’s citizens,” the Keidanren, the largest business lobby in Japan, said in a statement on Tuesday. The lobby had backed a target that would have allowed for a 4 percent increase in emissions from 1990, or a 4 percent decrease compared with 2005.

Mr. Aso was quick to point out that unlike targets set under the Kyoto Protocol, which allowed countries to use emissions offsets and other methods, the 15 percent decrease would come from actual cuts. The government recently introduced subsidies that encourage the use of solar power in Japanese homes, as well as incentives on low-emission cars.

The 15 percent target, he stressed, was a compromise he had reached after consulting extensively with scientists and economists, as well as with members of the public.

To meet the target, Japan will pursue breakthroughs in environmental technology, as well as expand the use of nuclear energy. Mr. Aso has said Tokyo aims to expand solar output by a factor of 20 and put more “green” cars on Japanese roads.

Meanwhile, Mr. Aso said it was imperative for countries that had not signed the Kyoto Protocol, like the United States and China, to join in the next round of talks. The Kyoto pact covered countries responsible for just 29 percent of global emissions, he said.

Tsutomu Toichi, head of the Institute of Energy Economics, an independent research organization, said Japan would struggle to meet its new emissions goals.

“Japan’s target is a compromise, but it’s still a tough one for Japan to meet,” Mr. Toichi said. “Japanese companies are already extremely energy efficient, so there’s much less room for improvement.”
375 2009-06-11 These days, business plan competitions yield prizes worth more than ever.

The Wharton Business Plan Competition, for example, awards $20,000 in cash and $10,000 in legal services to its top entrant. Harvard Business School’s traditional track competition awards $25,000 in cash and $25,000 in business services to its winner. M.I.T.’s Clean Energy Prize includes $200,000 in cash. And Rice University offers a whopping $225,000 prize to its first-place winner, including $125,000 in equity investment, $20,000 in cash and more than $80,000 in services.

Still, it’s really not about the money, says Cliff Holekamp, a senior lecturer in entrepreneurship at Washington University’s Olin Business School, which hosts multiple competitions, including the recently introduced Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation Competition, a do-good variation with a $150,000 prize pool. “The value of participation,” says Mr. Holekamp, “is not found in funding but in a process that brings you mentorship, support, structure and access to the resources and people that will help perfect your business model.”

As impressive as the cash awards sound, Saad Khan, who has served as a competition judge and is an investor with CMEA Capital in Mountain View, Calif., says the amounts are “fairly small in the context of starting a business.” A better reason to compete, he says, is “to get feedback in real time and to get noticed by alumni who have done well, local VCs and other investors in that community.”

There are even worthy competitions that offer no prize money. In 2006, for example, Ryan MacCauley won the Launch Award at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School with a plan for the Class Watch, a company he now runs with his brothers John and Kevin. “What wasn’t going to help us quit our day jobs and launch was a $20,000 check,” says Mr. MacCauley, “but winning gave us confidence.”

It also helped them secure a deal with an angel investor. The Class Watch, which sells customizable, college commemorative timepieces, began generating revenue in the second quarter of 2008 and hopes to hit $3 million in sales within a year.

Since their advent in 1984, when the University of Texas at Austin held its first “Moot Corp,” business plan competitions have proliferated within academia and beyond. More than 50 American colleges and universities host them. So do corporations, nonprofits and government economic development offices.

Hosts include Wal-Mart, Amazon.com, the states of Michigan and Nevada, the cities of Anaheim, Calif., and Pittsburgh, the Brooklyn Public Library, China’s government-controlled television network CCTV2, and Al Gore, in partnership with the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.

Some remain invitational but most have loosened their eligibility terms to foster interdisciplinary, international and intercollegiate collaboration (in other words, you don’t have to attend most business schools to enter their competitions).

Competition within the competitions can be fierce, however. And that’s why Cindy Boyd, who is chief executive of the Houston-based consultancy Sentigy and a frequent judge at competitions hosted by Rice University and the Entrepreneurs’ Organization, recommends that would-be entrants conduct extensive online research via the Web sites of the host organizations. Even more important, she suggests contacting past participants  judges, winners, and losers  to ask what worked and what didn’t.

Don’t submit an application, says Ms. Boyd, unless the advice you get sounds do-able for your team.

After selecting an appropriate competition, George Abe, a faculty director at U.C.L.A.’s Anderson School, says most teams should take at least a year to hone their business plans. “The earlier the prep begins,” says Mr. Abe, who has seven years of judging experience, “the better the plan is. You can get away with three months minimum if you have a product or service crystal clear in your mind. But you cannot be figuring out a market and competitive story in 60 days.”

Business plan competitions require an initial submission, sometimes called the “intent to compete” entry. Normally, it consists of a two-to-three-page executive summary explaining all elements of the business: product, market, competition, finances and operations. If it isn’t well written and succinct, a team won’t make it through the door.

“Students spend too much time describing the hammer and not enough time talking about the nails,” Mr. Abe says. “They have to be able to explain their product or service quickly so a judge not knowledgeable in the field can basically get it. What every judge knows is how to question students about markets, competition and finances. Those are the nails.” The bottom line: you need more than a cool idea; you have to show how the idea will make money.

Judges are often impressed by serious market research: the results of customer surveys, for example, or of pilot sales programs. That may have been what gave a team from the London Business School the edge in Columbia Business School’s first Odyssey competition this year.

The team’s plan, says a team spokesman, Vivek Makhija, was for “a renewable energy company using a combination of original and licensed technology to offer power generation at a micro level to households in India.” As yet unnamed, the company worked with an alumni mentor who is deeply involved in market research to develop comprehensive reports on rural Indian consumers’ access to and use of electricity.

Make Sure Your Teammates Know Their Roles

NIR Diagnostics wanted to commercialize technology that can prevent amputations and fatalities caused by chronic wounds. These sores may appear to be healing on the surface even though they’re actually deteriorating and infected underneath.

Clearly defined roles were essential, according to the team leader, Armen Karamanian, the interim chief executive. “We came together around common goals and complimentary skill sets,” Mr. Karamanian says. “We didn’t want to wind up with a great, life-saving idea  and lawsuits over this, that or money.” Have an honest discussion over what your team wants to accomplish beyond the academic exercise, such as how you want to start the business and who will do what, he suggests.

NIR Diagnostics won the 2009 Wharton Business Plan Competition and believes it can miniaturize, manufacture and sell by 2012 a device (based on technology created at Drexel University) that bounces lasers through layers of a chronic wound to give doctors a more complete reading of its healing progress.

The company, recently renamed Lumina Diagnostics, is now seeking a $15 million investment over several years to gain F.D.A. approvals and refine its technology..

394 2009-06-12 The station will be crowded as never before, with 13 people floating around: the seven astronauts on the shuttle meeting up with the station crew of six, which was expanded from three last month.

During five spacewalks, shuttle astronauts will unpack and install a “front porch” to the station to hold experimental samples exposed to the extremes of outer space. The other tasks include swapping out batteries on one of the station’s solar wings.

The choreography of construction will involve not only the spacewalkers, but also three robotic arms: the one aboard the Endeavour, the main robotic arm of the space station and a smaller arm that is part of the Japanese laboratory.

The commander of the Endeavour mission is Mark L. Polansky and the pilot is Lt. Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines. Also going up on the Endeavour are Cmdr. Christopher J. Cassidy of the Navy, Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army, Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn and Dr. David A. Wolf, all of NASA, and Julie Payette of the Canadian Space Agency. Colonel Kopra will remain on the space station as a flight engineer, while Koichi Wakata of the Japanese Space Agency, who has been in orbit since March, will return to Earth on the Endeavour.

When the Atlantis lifted off for the Hubble mission in May, the Endeavour was sitting on the other launching pad, ready to blast off on a rescue mission. Since the loss of the Columbia shuttle in 2003, the space station has served as a potential safe haven if another shuttle suffered major damage during liftoff or in flight. But because the telescope is in a different orbit, the Atlantis would have been unable to reach the space station.

The Atlantis flight concluded safely, and the preparation of the Endeavour for the rescue mission enabled the quick turnaround for its mission to the space station.

396 2009-06-12 Using its authority under the Voting Rights Act, the Justice Department has overturned two deeply flawed and discriminatory Georgia voting procedures. The decisions — invalidating badly designed systems for checking prospective voters’ personal information and citizenship — will prevent many eligible voters from being denied the right to cast a ballot.

They are a reminder, as the Supreme Court deliberates over a challenge to the Voting Rights Act, of why this landmark law is still very much needed. They are also a welcome change in direction for the Justice Department, which under the Bush administration routinely signed off on new state voting rules that made it harder for minorities to register and cast ballots.

Before the 2008 presidential election, voting rights advocates challenged two new systems of voter verification adopted in Georgia. One, known as “no match, no vote,” flagged new registrants whose basic information — name, date of birth, driver’s license number and last four digits of the Social Security number — did not match government databases. The other checked citizenship status through a similar matching process.

The trouble is, both systems were riddled with errors. When the Justice Department investigated the “no match, no vote” results, it found that thousands of eligible Georgia voters were wrongly flagged, often because of small glitches, like transposed digits in a driver’s license number. In the case of the citizenship check, over half of the roughly 7,000 people flagged as potential noncitizens actually were citizens.

The impact of Georgia’s faulty systems hit minority voters particularly hard. The majority of individuals flagged under “no match, no vote” were African-American. The citizenship match disproportionately affected black, Hispanic and Asian voters. Individuals who were flagged had to follow onerous procedures to prove their eligibility before they would be allowed to vote.

Georgia has every right to verify the identity and citizenship of people on its rolls. But it must use well-designed, accurate and nondiscriminatory methods.
397 2009-06-12 But the campaign on behalf of the dealers is also providing a test of one of the central criticisms of the government’s intrusion into the operations of many companies, from banks to insurers to auto giants. Even as they talk tough about the mismanagement of car companies, can members of Congress withstand political pressure and allow Chrysler and G.M. to make tough economic decisions that might hurt their own constituents?

For instance, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, came under fire for intervening with G.M. to keep a parts distribution center open in his district, preserving about 90 jobs for another year. Critics said Mr. Frank used his sway as an overseer of federal bailout money to intervene in the company’s decision-making.

Mr. Frank said that he made a common-sense argument to keep the center open, and that he was only standing up for his constituents. “I will bear up under the criticism that I have been doing too much for my district,” he said.

Other lawmakers said the growing number of calls for intervention showed the dangers of large-scale government involvement in the auto companies, saying the result would be lawmakers trying to serve as top executives of auto companies.

“It is incestuous for members of Congress to be saying, ‘Close this plant; use this model; don’t buy the Volt battery in South Korea but make it in my district,’ ” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, referring to the G.M. hybrid car now in development.

Senator Alexander has instituted a “car czar of the day” award in recognition of Congressional meddling. “What do people in Washington know about building cars?” he said. “I don’t think very much.”

Even lawmakers backing the dealers expressed mixed emotions about dipping into the workings of the auto companies. But the dealer closings are striking a nerve in Congress. The federal government has been coming to the aid of the auto manufacturers, which lawmakers see as then turning around and abandoning the element of the industry closest to home for most of them.

Representative Frank M. Kratovil, a Maryland Democrat who has introduced a measure that would restore the franchise agreements, portrayed the situation as a “bailout for the big guys, but a force-out for the little guys.”

In the Senate, lawmakers have not gone as far as the House in pushing a bill to block the move by the manufacturers. But members of the Senate commerce committee this week urged Chrysler to allow dealers a chance to appeal the closures and for both carmakers to give preference to existing, profitable operations when the automakers try to set up new franchises in areas where dealers were shut off. G.M. already has an appeals process for dealers scheduled for closure.

“We think — in the interest of fairness — that profitable dealers in this situation should have a right of first refusal for the new dealership when Chrysler returns to that particular market,” read a letter signed by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the committee, along with other members. A similar letter was sent to G.M.

The car companies say that they need to scale back to be able to return to profitability and that cutting the number of dealers is crucial to that effort.

At a hearing last week of the commerce committee, Fritz Henderson, the chief executive of G.M., said that much of the growth in his company’s dealer network occurred decades ago. Since then, he said, “our market share has shrunk, leaving us with too many dealerships.”

“Everyone agrees — even the dealers themselves — that a restructuring of G.M.’s dealer network must take place,” Mr. Henderson said.

Some point to the millions of dollars in campaign contributions that politically active car dealers have given to Congressional candidates over the years in explaining the intense interest in going to bat for the dealers. But lawmakers say that they are only trying to protect local jobs at companies that have persevered in difficult times and that donations have nothing to do with it.

Representative Dan Maffei, a freshman Democrat from New York who helped write the measure to protect the dealers, said that in his case, local car dealers strongly supported the opposition. “The vast majority are either nonpolitical or support the other party pretty strongly,” Mr. Maffei said.

Mr. Maffei said he hoped his legislation, which has already attracted about 70 co-sponsors, would spur new negotiations between the car companies and the dealers.

The Obama administration has so far shown no inclination to push back against the closures, noting that its efforts on behalf of the manufacturers have kept most dealers in business. And with Chrysler already cutting its ties with dealers, undoing those decisions might be difficult. But lawmakers say they intend to try.

“We are sure that if we do nothing, nothing will happen,” said Representative Hoyer, the House majority leader and a Maryland Democrat, who is backing the effort to restore the franchise contracts.

But it may be too late to help Mr. Shaub. Workers on Thursday were answering the phone at his business as Montrose Automotive rather than Montrose Dodge. “I am not sure this is going to do any good,” he said of the Congressional effort.
398 2009-06-12 Bunch of Grapes, the Martha’s Vineyard bookstore that was badly damaged by fire last summer, has a new owner and will reopen this season. Founded in 1975 in Vineyard Haven, Mass., the independent bookstore was damaged last Fourth of July weekend when fire broke out at a nearby cafe. In a news release, Dawn Braasch, the new owner of Bunch of Grapes, said that the store would hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its Main Street location on Saturday at 9 a.m., and that a grand reopening celebration was planned for July 4. Ms. Braasch, the bookstore’s former events coordinator, bought it from its previous owner, Jon Nelson, about six months ago, according to Steve Fischer, executive director of the New England Independent Booksellers Association.
399 2009-06-12 Another wave of protests appears likely because indigenous groups are demanding that the decrees be repealed and not just suspended. The decrees would open large jungle areas to investment and allow companies to bypass indigenous groups to obtain permits for petroleum exploration, logging and building hydroelectric dams. A stopgap attempt to halt earlier indigenous protests in the Amazon last August failed to prevent them from being reinitiated more forcefully in April.

The authorities said that nine civilians were killed in the clashes that took place last Friday on a remote highway in Bagua. But witnesses and relatives of missing protesters contend that the authorities are covering up details of the episode, and that more Indians died. Twenty-four police officers were killed on the highway and at an oil installation.

Indigenous representatives say at least 25 civilians, and perhaps more, may have been killed, and some witnesses say that security forces dumped the bodies of protesters into a nearby river. At least three Indians who were wounded said they had been shot by police officers as they waited to talk with the authorities.

“The government is trying to clean the blood off its hands by hiding the truth,” said Andrés Huaynacari Etsam, 21, an Awajún student here who said that five of his relatives had been killed on June 5 and that three were missing.

Senior government officials repudiate such claims. “There is a game of political interests taking place in which some are trying to exaggerate the losses of life for their own gain,” said Foreign Minister José García Belaunde.

He said the ultimate aim of the protesters was to prevent Peru from carrying out a trade agreement with the United States, because one of the most contentious of the decrees that were suspended on Thursday would bring Peru’s rules for investment in jungle areas into line with the trade agreement.

“But,” Mr. García Belaunde insisted, “the agreement is not in danger.”

Still, the government’s initial response to the violence seems to have heightened resentment. A television commercial by the Interior Ministrycontained graphic images of the bodies of some police officers who were killed while being held hostage by protesters. The commercial said that the killings were proof of the “ferocity and savagery” of indigenous activists, but an uproar over that depiction forced the government to try to withdraw the commercial.

The authorities are struggling to understand a movement that is crystallizing in the Peruvian Amazon among more than 50 indigenous groups. They include about 300,000 people, accounting for only about 1 percent of Peru’s population, but they live in strategically important and resource-rich locations, which are scattered throughout jungle areas that account for nearly two-thirds of Peru’s territory.

So far, alliances have proved elusive between Indians in the Amazon and indigenous groups in highland areas, ruling out, for now, the kind of broad indigenous protest movements that helped oust governments in neighboring Ecuador and Bolivia earlier in the decade.

In contrast to some earlier efforts to organize indigenous groups, the leaders of this new movement are themselves indigenous, and not white or mestizo urban intellectuals. They are well organized and use a web of radio stations to exchange information across the jungle. After one prominent leader, Alberto Pizango, was granted asylum in Nicaragua this week, others quickly emerged to articulate demands.

“There has been nothing comparable in all my years here in terms of the growth of political consciousness among indigenous groups,” said the Rev. Joaquín García, 70, a priest from Spain who arrived in Iquitos 41 years ago and directs the Center of Theological Studies of the Amazon, which focuses on indigenous issues.

“At issue now,” he said, “is what they decide to do with the newfound bargaining power in their hands.”
400 2009-06-12 Mormon men are expected to serve a two-year mission in their early 20s, and about two-thirds of Pinnacle Security’s 1,800 sales representatives this summer have been through the experience. Former missionaries work for other direct-sales companies, too, though Pinnacle seems to be in a class by itself: It has deployed them in 75 cities nationwide.

“They’re used to knocking on doors, and they’re used to rejection,” said Scott Warner, Pinnacle’s manager of the Chicago sales team.

Mr. Warner said interest in the security products was up this year — a recession indicator, he said — as people reacted to fear (if not always a statistical reality) of rising crime. But the number of potential customers who cannot pass checks is up, too, with more homeowners unable to afford the $40 or so a month that Pinnacle charges to monitor a system. The company also charges a $99 installation fee, but nothing for the alarm equipment itself in a standard package.

As millions of traditional jobs dried up last year, at least 100,000 Americans joined the ranks of what is called, in the trade, direct sales. With items like cosmetics and skin care (Mary Kay, ) and housewares (Cutco knives, Fuller Brush), more than 15.1 million people are now selling something, or trying to, somewhere far beyond the mall.

And retention is up in a profession with a notoriously high burn-out rate, industry experts say. (Fifty to 100 door-knocks a day, with one or two completed sales, is an average grind.) At Pinnacle Security’s Oak Brook office, for example, only about 15 percent of the reps had given up and gone home, or not worked out to expectations, after the first month of the sales season, which began in early May — about half the normal attrition rate.

“Consumer companies and retailers are trying to break through the clutter, and it’s a lot easier for companies to recruit talent in this job market,” said Thomas Lutz, a senior partner in the Boston Consulting Group, which advises companies on growth and marketing.

Business is only part of the chemistry though. In a free-market economy, every sale or purchase is on some level an act of conversion, a matter of overcoming objections or and getting to “yes.” Decision making and trust are never entirely matters of pure logic.

Matt Romero, a 24-year-old college student from Draper, Utah, south of , admitted freely that in his heart he was still partly a missionary.

Mr. Romero is fluent in Spanish from his mission to , eloquent and invariably polite in English in trolling the mostly black neighborhoods of Chicago’s South Side. He made $13,000 last summer selling 60 security systems for Pinnacle and is aspiring this year to sell 150 systems, which would trigger big incentive bonuses that could increase his pay to $75,000 or more.

But he said he was also ready to render unto God the things that are God’s.

His thinking on that question changed one afternoon in early May. A woman opened the door and wanted to talk about religion.

“She asked me if I believed in Christ and if I knew who my savior was and I said, ‘Yes, ma’am,’ and we had a discussion and she told me, ‘No one comes in my house without hearing the word,’ and I said, ‘That’s a good policy, ma’am,’ ” Mr. Romero said on a recent afternoon of knocking on doors.

“Since then, I’ve been carrying around these little cards,” he said, lifting up his stack of Pinnacle brochures to reveal a smaller stack of what are called “pass-along cards,” with facts and frequently asked questions about the Mormon Church. Marketing experts say that cold-calling in general has become more sophisticated since the era of Willy Loman, with training, mentoring and recruiting efforts sharpened at many companies. But Pinnacle’s salesmen are also applying skills learned in the mission field, like “mimic and mirror,” a technique of adapting one’s posture and bearing to the person being spoken to as a way of inducing trust — if his arms are crossed, you cross yours; if she tilts her head in asking a question, you do the same.

“Before my mission, I knocked on doors and I had some success,” said Matt Biesinger, 23, who worked a summer for Pinnacle before going to as a missionary. “On the mission, I learned how to talk to people.”

Role-playing exercises conducted on many mornings reinforce those lessons. Look into a potential customer’s eye, trainers say, but do not stare, which can appear confrontational. When the door opens, always stand at a slight angle to diffuse any body language that might convey threat. And never diminish yourself by using the word, “just,” as in, “I’m just here in the neighborhood.”

Sometimes, though, it rains, and when it does, Pinnacle’s sink-or-swim mentality for sales reps, especially new, unproven ones like Brandon Rogers, is tough love at its toughest.

Newbies, for fear they may retreat to their cars, are dropped off and left on foot without shelter or access to a bathroom unless they can gain admittance into a house to make their sales pitch. Mr. Rogers, who is 21, had three energy bars and no umbrella to last him through a long, wet day.

He had made one sale by dark, when they picked him up.
401 2009-06-12 Rumors of Exxon’s entry to the project had been swirling for several days in Alaska. With production from the Prudhoe Bay oil field declining, Alaskans have been hoping for years that natural gas would take over as the state’s financial mainstay.

Alaska’s estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves are now being reinjected into oil fields or left in the ground because there is no way to get the fuel to consumers.

With Exxon and TransCanada on one side, and BP and Conoco on the other, there are two contenders for what would be the biggest civil engineering project in North America, and one of the most challenging. It would dwarf the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline, a momentous project that was completed in 1977.

BP and Conoco said their joint pipeline project, called Denali, was going forward. But both said they would be open to alternative plans.

Charlie Rowton of ConocoPhillips said, “We do believe the opportunity exists for more collaboration among key stakeholders interested in an Alaska gas pipeline project.”

Steve Rinehart, a BP spokesman, said, “BP as a producer and prospective shipper will consider any viable project to deliver gas to market.”

TransCanada has estimated that the project would cost $30 billion. It would stretch roughly 1,700 miles from the North Slope of Alaska through Yukon and northeastern British Columbia to the Alberta border near Boundary Lake. From there, it would connect to Alberta’s existing gas infrastructure, which is linked to the United States.

The pipe would have a daily capacity of six billion cubic feet of natural gas, or about 10 percent of current domestic consumption. It would begin operations in 2018.

Building an Alaska gas pipeline has been sought for decades as a crucial element of the nation’s energy security. But new drilling methods in places like Texas and Oklahoma have unlocked substantially more domestic gas reserves in recent years than most experts ever anticipated. Instead of a facing a potential gas shortage, the nation is looking at the possibility of a surplus.

When Governor Palin took office in late 2006, she interrupted the negotiations that her predecessor, Frank H. Murkowski, had been pursuing with the North Slope oil operators, BP, Conoco and Exxon Mobil, to build a pipeline. After saying the talks were too secretive and not competitive, the governor sought to bring in new operators to secure better terms for Alaska. Late last year, Alaska picked TransCanada as its preferred operator after a competition that was shunned by the major companies, including Exxon.

Tony Palmer, vice president of Alaska development for TransCanada, said the project would make economic sense as worldwide gas supplies tighten and prices rise, and he welcomed Exxon’s decision to participate.

“We think it is an important step forward,” Mr. Palmer said.
402 2009-06-12 SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) — Yahoo has lured a chief financial officer away from the Altera Corporation to fill a crucial role in its new management team.

The company said Thursday that it had hired Tim Morse from Altera, a chip maker based in San Jose, Calif., not far from Yahoo’s base in Sunnyvale. Mr. Morse became Altera’s chief financial officer in 2007 after spending 15 years in various positions at General Electric.

The hiring of Mr. Morse ends Yahoo’s three-and-a-half-month search for a successor to its current chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen, who announced his plans to leave a few weeks after the company hired Carol Bartz as its new chief executive.

Mr. Jorgensen, who will depart with a $1.8 million severance package, is set to become chief financial officer of the jeans maker Levi Strauss & Company on July 1.

Mr. Morse, 40, will start at Yahoo with a $500,000 salary, up from the $375,000 he was getting at Altera. Yahoo is also paying him a $500,000 signing bonus, 400,000 shares of stock options and 150,000 shares of restricted stock.
403 2009-06-12 Moscow has long protested American plans to build a radar site in the Czech Republic and to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in Poland, arguing that the system could target Russia. Two years ago, Vladimir V. Putin, then the president, proposed jointly operating a radar station in Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic, or one on Russian territory, but American military officials did not see them as substitutes for the planned Czech site.

The Obama administration appears to be reconsidering the idea of collaborating on missile defense as part of the “reset” of its relations with Russia.

During testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Gates said he believed that Russian leaders now agreed with Washington on the potential nuclear threat posed by Iran.

“When I first met with President Putin and talked about this, he basically dismissed the idea that the Iranians would have a missile” capable of reaching Europe, Mr. Gates said. “And the fact of the matter is, the Russians have come back to us and acknowledged that we were right in terms of the nearness of the Iranian missile threat.”

He said Washington had put forward some options for collaboration, among them “putting radars in Russia, having data-exchange centers in Russia.” He said at the July summit meeting between Mr. Obama and the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, that the leaders could “make some steps where they will partner with us and Poland and the Czech Republic in going forward with missile defense in this third site.”

A spokesman for Mr. Gates had no comment on Thursday.

Moscow received the remarks coolly, with Mr. Nesterenko commenting that they “reflect the U.S.’s wishful thinking, rather than the way things actually are.”

For Russia, any reconfiguration that preserves sites in Poland and the Czech Republic “is just window dressing,” said Dmitri V. Trenin, a political analyst.

“I’m not sure everyone in the U.S. understands how much is at stake as far as the Russians are concerned,” said Mr. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “The issue for the Russians is, what are the U.S.’s long-term intentions vis-à-vis Russia? And they are looking at missile defense for the answer to that question.”

An unwillingness to scrap the Eastern European facilities would be seen by hawks in Moscow as evidence that “the hidden agenda is to contain and destroy Russia,” he said.

Some observers saw positive signs in the exchange, noting that missile defense might ultimately matter more to Russia than renegotiating the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the mutually agreed-upon first step in the “reset.” Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dvorkin, a researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said a radar site in Russia was only one in an array of options for reconfiguring missile defense. Others, he said, are the use of Russian radars in Belarus, Russian missile-testing ranges, Russian expertise in antimissile rockets or even Russian S-400 missile complexes as part of the shield.

“What’s new,” he said, “is a desire and determination for cooperation on many issues.”
404 2009-06-12 Gaafar al-Nimeiry, an army colonel who took over Sudan in a 1969 coup and, by taking a constantly swerving political course, held on to the presidency until a bloodless coup ousted him in 1985, died in Sudan on May 30. He was 79.

The death was announced by SUNA, the state news agency, which did not give a cause.

In his 16-year tenure, President Nimeiry veered from ardent Arab nationalism to socialism, from friendly relations with the Soviet Union to a pro-Western stance and a close alliance with the United States. Although he was often seen as one of the more moderate Arab leaders, he was not averse to violent crackdowns and even mass executions of opponents. He survived four attempted coups in his first nine years in power.

Colonel Nimeiry led a small group, calling itself the Free Officers, that seized power on May 25, 1969. Their cause, they said, was Arab nationalism and revolutionary socialism patterned after the ideology of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. At the time of the coup, the southern region of Sudan — home to black Christians and animists who felt oppressed by the Muslim-dominated government — had been plagued by rebellion for 14 years.

Step by step over the next eight years, President Nimeiry tried to draw together the diverse elements of his country: the Christians and animists in the south, hard-line Muslims and die-hard Communists. He met resistance from extremists on the left and the right.

In 1971, Mr. Nimeiry survived a Communist-instigated coup during which he was imprisoned for three days. He escaped by jumping out a window as loyalist forces arrived. After that coup attempt, he started turning Sudan away from Soviet influence and toward an alliance with conservative Arab governments like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. His government also became more pro-Western and began receiving armaments from the United States.

Then, in March 1972, he signed a peace agreement with the rebels in the south, granting regional autonomy to the southern provinces. His unification efforts were lauded in the West. He was the only Arab leader to support President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt after Mr. Sadat signed the Camp David peace accords with Israel in 1978.
405 2009-06-12 WASHINGTON (AP) — American households lost $1.33 trillion of their wealth in the first three months as the recession took a bite out of stock portfolios and dragged down home prices.

The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that household net worth fell to $50.38 trillion in the January-March quarter, the lowest level since the third quarter of 2004. The first-quarter figure was a decline of 2.6 percent, or $1.33 trillion, from the final quarter of 2008.

Net worth represents total assets like homes and checking accounts, minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debt.

The damage to wealth in the first quarter came from the sinking stock market. The value of Americans’ stock holdings dropped 5.8 percent from the final quarter of last year.

Another hit came from falling house prices. The value of household real-estate holdings fell 2.4 percent. Collectively, homeowners had 41.4 percent equity in their homes in the first quarter. That was down from 42.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

The latest snapshot of Americans’ balance sheets was contained in the Fed’s quarterly report called the flow of funds.
406 2009-06-12 ALBANY  For a fourth day, pandemonium reigned in the Capitol.

Republicans used a mysterious set of keys to force their way into the Senate chamber for the first time since their leadership coup on Monday. Protesters chanted “Senate not for sale” and banged on the chamber’s windows while Republicans tried to convene. And the Republicans’ vow to resume the session fizzled after one of the two dissident Democrats they were depending on for a quorum, Hiram Monserrate of Queens, walked out of the chamber shortly after the proceedings began.

Both sides continued to battle in court; a hearing is set for Friday morning, and Democrats will argue that the Republicans’ coup was illegitimate.

“The dysfunction and chaos in the Senate has wasted an entire week of the people’s business,” a clearly irritated Gov. David A. Paterson said in a statement released Thursday. He has been largely relegated to the sidelines during the dispute.

By day’s end, it was clear that the balance of power in the state’s upper house  and the very gears of state government  continued to rest in the hands of Mr. Monserrate, who was indicted in March on charges of slashing his female companion with a broken glass.

As he was leaving the Senate chamber, a Republican staff member dashed after him, pleading, “Senator, we need you back in there.” But Mr. Monserrate said he was committed to recruiting more Democrats to join the coalition and would be holding meetings all day in hopes of doing so, even as those Democrats were simultaneously trying to woo him back to their side.

“This chamber must not remain divided,” he said. “You can’t have coalition government with 2 Democrats and 30 Republicans.”

There were many other developments throughout the day.

The Senate’s new president, Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat sharing power with Republicans, tried to lure his former Democratic colleagues back to the chamber by offering to bring same-sex marriage legislation to the Senate’s floor next week, for the first time in the Senate’s history.

His comments prompted the Senate’s only openly gay member, Thomas K. Duane, to say he was open to abandoning the Democratic caucus, a day after his staff insisted he was staying put. “Today, I’m in the Democratic conference, and I’m a Democrat,” he added. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone what’s going to happen when everyone comes back on Monday.”

Democrats also huddled behind closed doors to decide the fate of their leader, Malcolm A. Smith, whom many blame for losing control of the first Democratic Senate majority in four decades after just five months. Senator John L. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat, is seen as Mr. Smith’s most likely potential successor, though Democrats cautioned that they were not yet prepared to depose Mr. Smith.

Further complicating matters, Mr. Monserrate reiterated his support for Mr. Espada, but would not answer when asked repeatedly if he still supported Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican who was named majority leader on Monday, in a power-sharing deal with Mr. Espada.

Certainly, the rising political fortunes of Mr. Espada and Mr. Monserrate have given many pause. Mr. Monserrate has his pending criminal case. Mr. Espada has been fined more than $60,000 for failing to disclose his campaign contributions; the attorney general is investigating whether a nonprofit group he founded misappropriated money, and the Bronx district attorney is investigating whether his primary residence is in his district.

As Senate president, he would become governor if David A. Paterson were incapacitated, though a court temporarily blocked Mr. Espada from becoming second in the line of succession Thursday.

If he remains president, it appears that the State Constitution gives Mr. Espada the authority to issue pardons even if Mr. Paterson is merely traveling out of state  potentially even to himself  though there is some dispute about the legal fine points.

The unlikely alliance has left Republicans on the defensive.

“It was all right when they were the 31st and 32nd vote on that side,” said Senator Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican who was, only weeks ago, calling for Mr. Monserrate’s resignation. “All of a sudden, they’re criminals? When they join us, they’re criminals.”

But Mr. Golden admitted to feeling a little queasy.

“Do I feel a little uncomfortable? The answer is yes,” he said, adding that if Mr. Monserrate was “found guilty in a court of law, he should pay the price.”

Lawmakers continued to ignore the governor’s pleas to return to work. The governor said in an appearance on WNYC that he doubted how successful the Democrats’ court challenge could be because they appeared to lack the votes needed to maintain a solid majority.

“Even if you’ve won the court battle, as soon as you go back into session, if you don’t have the votes, if somebody calls a vote, you lose,” Mr. Paterson said.

He also cast doubt on the Democrats’ legal argument that Mr. Smith could not be forced out in the middle of the session because he was elected by his colleagues for a two-year term, saying “power has been changed in legislative bodies for centuries.”

But his spokesman denied a statement by Mr. Espada that the governor “duly recognized” him as the Senate president during a phone call. “That’s false,” said Peter Kauffmann, a Paterson spokesman.

The Senate has already forfeited a week of its legislative session during one of the busiest times of year, the traditional rush before the close of the session on June 22. The governor threatened to force lawmakers to extend the legislative session, though it is not clear when a clear leader will emerge. Republicans said they would attempt to resume the session Monday afternoon. In the meantime, many issues have been sidelined, including mayoral control of the schools in New York City.

While the Senate was a carnival of dysfunction, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver kept the trains running in his chamber in almost plodding defiance, passing 129 bills in four days, including legislation that extended wage protections to farm workers and a bill that allowed a Long Island church to apply for a property tax exemption.

“Eventually, we have to govern here,” the gravel-voiced Mr. Silver said this week. “We’re trying to do it on a daily basis.”
407 2009-06-12 Rising prices at the gasoline pump drove retail sales higher in May, the government reported on Thursday, but consumers were also spending more at car dealerships, grocery stores and clothing shops.

The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in May from a month earlier, after falling the two previous months. The monthly increase indicated that consumer spending was creeping higher as gas prices rose and the economy’s declines began to level off.

“It’s price-driven,” said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody’s Economy.com. “Consumers are prioritizing, focusing their spending on necessities. If gasoline prices continue to climb, their purchasing power will take a big hit.”

The increase in May sales matched the expectations of many economists.

Sales at gasoline stations, though 33.8 percent lower than the previous May, rose 3.6 percent from April. Gasoline prices have risen to a nationwide average of $2.63 a gallon as crude oil prices rise, driven higher by signals that the recession’s worst days may be over and by concerns about inflation in the future.

Sales at automobile and parts dealerships rose 0.5 percent from April, a sign that consumers took advantage of big discounts as automakers like Chrysler and General Motors prepared to shut down hundreds of dealerships. Sales at dealerships were down 19.6 percent from the May a year ago.
408 2009-06-12 PARIS — Crude oil climbed above $72 a barrel on Thursday as the International Energy Agency revised upward its forecast for global oil demand on signs that the downturn in the world economy was flattening out.

The agency, based in Paris, now estimates global demand will be 83.3 million barrels a day this year, up 120,000 barrels a day from its previous forecast.

The new forecast still represents a decline of 2.9 percent from the 2008 level, the agency said, cautioning that the revisions “do not necessarily imply economic recovery, but may reflect a slowing in previously sharp decline.”

Crude oil futures settled at $72.68 a barrel in New York trading. The price of oil has more than doubled since sliding below $35 in February, in part because of Chinese stockpiling that began in April.

Higher energy costs have raised concerns that whatever “green shoots” may have begun to grow in the world economy could be cut down before a full recovery takes hold.
409 2009-06-12 It came as no surprise on Thursday when the World Health Organization declared that the swine flu outbreak had become a pandemic.

The disease has reached 74 countries, and probably met the technical definition of a pandemic  or global spread  weeks ago. Nearly 30,000 cases have been reported, but disease experts think hundreds of thousands or millions of people have actually been infected.

So the agency made official what had become obvious: that the H1N1 virus is spreading quickly in different parts of the world, and its chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, said, “Further spread is considered inevitable.”

The announcement does not mean that the illness, which has been mild in most people, has become any worse. The term pandemic reflects only the geographic spread of a new disease, not its severity. Pandemics typically infect about a third of the world in a year or two, and sometimes strike in successive waves.

“Globally, we have good reason to believe that this pandemic, at least in its early days, will be of moderate severity,” said Dr. Chan, director general of the health agency. So far, 144 people have died from H1N1.

The decision to raise the pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6, its highest level, is meant to signal to countries to step up their efforts to deal with the disease.

It also means that the health organization is asking drug makers to start making vaccine as quickly as possible, with the hope of having some batches ready by September. Efforts to make a vaccine are under way, and stockpiles of antiviral drugs have been opened. But the agency does not recommend closing borders or restricting travel.

“This is not a surprise,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “For all intents and purposes, the United States government has been in Phase 6 of the pandemic for some time now.”

Even though the disease has been relatively mild in most people so far, governments must not relax, Dr. Chan said. For one thing, she explained, the virus could change at any time and become more severe.

In addition, the illness may take a greater toll when it reaches poor countries with higher rates of malnutrition, AIDS and other diseases that can lower people’s resistance to infection. Dr. Chan said rich countries should help poor ones less able to protect themselves.

Even in developed countries, the virus can cause severe and sometimes fatal illness in pregnant women, babies and people with underlying problems like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases. Dr. Frieden said people in those risk groups should seek treatment if they have a fever of at least 100.4, and a cough or a sore throat.

A third to half of the severe and fatal cases have occurred in young and middle-aged people who were previously healthy. In contrast, seasonal flu tends to kill the frail elderly.

The severity of the new virus does not even approach that of the 1918 one, which killed 40 million to 50 million people worldwide. But even the milder flu pandemics took serious death tolls. The one in 1957 killed two million people, and the 1968 pandemic killed about one million. Seasonal flu, by comparison, kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year.

Countries that have not yet had cases must anticipate them and prepare their health systems to treat patients, Dr. Chan said. Countries in the early stages of outbreaks should try to contain the disease, she said. Those further along, like Mexico, should not let their guard down even if the disease seems to be waning, she added.

“The virus can come back in a second wave,” Dr. Chan said. “When you’re over the first wave, start preparing for the future.”

The W.H.O. has been questioned sharply for weeks as to why it would not go to Phase 6 even though the spread of cases, first in Britain and Spain, then in Japan, Australia and Chile, seemed to meet its pandemic definition: the sustained community spread of a novel virus in two different W.H.O. regions.

Dr. Chan has indicated recently that she thought a pandemic was under way, especially as cases in Australia quadrupled in a week, but she wanted to consult with countries that had large outbreaks and then with a panel of experts on Thursday.

From early reports in Mexico and the United States, scientists have said that H1N1 appears to have roughly the same 0.6 percent death level as the 1957 Asian flu. The 1918 flu killed about 2.5 percent of those infected.

But in 1918, antibiotics did not exist, and many people died of secondary bacterial infections. In 1957, antiviral drugs did not exist, and mechanical ventilators were less common.

Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said this year’s flu is not acting like the 1957 one, which quickly faded into a seasonal pattern. There would normally be no flu cases in the United States in June, but flu hospitalizations are increasing in Minnesota, he said.

Flu levels continue to be high in New York and New England, and especially in Massachusetts, the C.D.C. said.

414 2009-06-13 Howard is the franchise star, but he is a career 60 percent free-throw shooter, so his errant shots were inconvenient but not entirely surprising. More startling were the four missed free throws by Hedo Turkoglu, a career 80 percent foul shooter and the Magic’s leading scorer in the finals.

“You just feel that moment just kind of slips out of your hand, and you just miss it,” Turkoglu said wistfully.

The most-debated play of the night came after Howard’s missed free throws. With 10.8 seconds left, Jackson elected to run an inbounds play in the backcourt. It gave the Lakers more room to work and it seemed to catch the Magic off guard.

Orlando trapped Kobe Bryant, who gave up the ball to Trevor Ariza. He passed to Derek Fisher, who streaked upcourt and hit the tying 3-pointer with 4.6 seconds left. The second-guessing was almost immediate. With a 3-point lead, should the Magic have fouled intentionally?

Magic Coach Stan Van Gundy expressed some regret in the immediate aftermath, but he was more circumspect Friday.

“I still don’t think at 11 seconds to go in a game that we’re going to foul in that situation,” Van Gundy said in a conference call with reporters. “I’ll put it this way: You always have regrets. Faced with the same situation again at 11 seconds, we still wouldn’t be telling them to foul.”

The next glitch was more fundamental. Jameer Nelson picked up Fisher on the play but gave him a wide berth to drive, pull up and shoot, as if he were more concerned with Fisher’s driving to the basket for a 2-pointer.

“Basically, Jameer had one responsibility on the play, and that was to not give Derek Fisher a look at a 3,” Van Gundy said. “It’s one of those things I’m sure Jameer wishes he had back and had played differently. I question whether we made that clear enough or could have told him to play the play a different way. But I thought we were pretty clear on that.”

The Magic had one chance to win in regulation, but the inbounds play also went awry, with Turkoglu dishing to Mickael Pietrus, who missed a 20-footer. Howard was in the paint, guarded only by Bryant, and Rashard Lewis was alone in the corner.

“It was totally my fault,” said Turkoglu, adding that he panicked with the five-second count running down.

Overtime brought more of the same. Turkoglu and Howard went a combined 0 for 5 from the field. Howard missed a free throw. Lewis lost the ball. Fisher hit another 3-pointer, this time when Nelson left him to double-team Bryant at the top of the key. Nelson took an elbow in the mouth as Bryant passed, and Fisher hit the shot that put the Lakers ahead for good.

The series, of course, began with Van Gundy’s decision to play Nelson, who had been out for four months after shoulder surgery. His return unsettled point guard Rafer Alston. Their roles have changed from game to game. The regrets and questionable decisions keep mounting for Orlando, while the odds of winning the championship keep shrinking.

Yet the series ledger could easily be reversed. The Magic also lost Game 2 in overtime, after Courtney Lee missed an alley-oop at the buzzer to end regulation. The last three games have been decided by 5, 4 and 8 points.

“This game is about inches,” Jackson said, “and sometimes just a trifle.”
415 2009-06-13 The Hartford Financial Services Group said it would accept as much as $3.4 billion in federal Troubled Asset Relief Program funds and sell $750 million of shares. The stock fell 8 percent, to $12.95. The common share offering to private investors will be carried out over time in a so-called discretionary equity issuance, Hartford said in a statement. Last month the Treasury Department approved six insurance companies for TARP money, but only Hartford has accepted so far. It has posted about $12.4 billion in write-downs and unrealized losses tied to the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, second-worst among American insurers to the American International Group.
416 2009-06-13 Merck & Company’s top-selling drug, the asthma medication Singulair, and similar medicines should come with a caution about reports of psychiatric problems in some patients, the Food and Drug Administration said. The F.D.A. requested a precaution in the prescribing instructions for Singulair, Accolate from AstraZeneca and Zyflo and Zyflo CR from Cornerstone Therapeutics. A precaution is a less serious alert than a warning. Problems reported include agitation, suicide, depression, insomnia and irritability, the F.D.A. said. Merck said it was confident in the safety of Singulair, its biggest product with annual sales of $4.5 billion, and would revise the drug label as requested.
417 2009-06-13 Interest in the discount department store Filene’s Basement, which is bankruptcy court, heated up after the judge overseeing the case ordered the auction reopened because of complaints from rival bidders about the auction process. The Syms Corporation and Vornado Realty Trust raised their joint bid to $61.3 million, from $60 million, said Terry Corrigan of Abacus Advisors, which is overseeing the restructuring of the Boston retailer. A rival bid by Men’s Wearhouse and Crown Holdings, an investment firm, had reached $64.9 million, he said. The bids cover different Filene’s stores. An affiliate of Men’s Wearhouse had submitted the winning bid at an earlier auction, but bidding was reopened after complaints about the process.
418 2009-06-13 A June 8 online letter about Microsoft’s new search engine, Bing, suggests a negative connotation with the Bing brand in China. It is because we were aware of this one possible interpretation that we chose to select a Chinese character to pair up with Bing to form the brand.

This approach enables us to ensure appropriate pronunciation for Bing in China. Our new brand in China is pronounced “bee-ying,” its meaning derived from the last two characters of a Chinese proverb meaning “ask and you shall find.” The direct translation for “Bi-ying” is “certain to respond or ready to answer.”

Developing a global brand is no small feat. Bing is available in 53 countries and 34 languages. We underwent a comprehensive process to arrive at a Chinese brand for Bing, including customer research and consultation with Chinese-language specialists. We think we arrived at a good result.
419 2009-06-13 “A lot of these merchants are saying they lost 50 percent of their business — and that was even before the recession,” said Edward D. Sheffe III, the chairman of the community board’s financial district committee. “They are operating at the epicenter of the nation’s largest urban-renewal project in history.”

Some of them have been frustrated by the omission of their blocks from the development corporation’s list of those affected by construction work. Until now, that list has included about 60 blocks. But Mr. Sheffe said that more than 200 blocks have suffered from disruptions of vehicle and pedestrian traffic caused by major public works like the construction of the Fulton Street Transit Center and smaller projects to repair the district’s basic infrastructure.

The program’s expansion could produce a lifeline for merchants like Mouhamad Shami, who runs Alfanoose, a Middle Eastern restaurant on a narrow arc of Maiden Lane between Broadway and Nassau Street. Mr. Shami has been struggling to keep his restaurant open as his Wall Street clientele shrinks and cuts spending. In recent weeks, he said, orders from the big financial companies in the district’s office towers have been down by about half from a year ago.

“Whatever they give us, it will be great,” Mr. Shami said of the proposed expansion of the assistance program. “Every bit helps.”

But it would come too late to help Klatch, a cafe that opened across the street from Alfanoose in March 2003, on a day when George E. Pataki, who was governor at the time, and several officials of the development corporation paid a surprise visit. Klatch’s owner, Pam Chmiel, was evicted one morning this past April, after she fell behind on the cafe’s rent.

“The marshals showed up at my door and said, ‘We’re closing you down,’ ” Ms. Chmiel recounted. “It was so humiliating and shocking.”

She said that just before Klatch was shuttered, she appealed to the development corporation, whose board meetings she had catered. But she was told that the construction on her block had ended too soon for her to qualify for any assistance, she said.

The aid that Klatch might have been eligible for could have made the difference between success and failure, Ms. Chmiel said.

“It would have gone straight to my landlord to appease him and maybe to inspire him to lower my rent, as I was asking,” she said. “It could have definitely helped restore the business.”

A week after Klatch closed, a neighboring business, Mardi Gras Pizza, also shut down.

“While still not fully recovered from the devastating economic effects of 9/11, Lower Manhattan’s business community is now suffering a second major crisis due to the hardships of the current recession,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who is on the development corporation’s advisory council. “This small-business assistance is immensely important for the survival of these businesses — and for economic development — in my district.”
420 2009-06-13 The Justice Department has moved to dismiss a same-sex marriage case in the federal courts that challenges the Defense of Marriage Act. The motion to dismiss Smelt v. United States, a suit brought in California, angered groups favoring such marriages. A coalition of advocacy groups issued a statement decrying the move, saying that “the administration is using many of the same flawed legal arguments that the Bush administration used.” A Justice Department spokesman said the administration was following a customary practice of “defending the law on the books in court.”
421 2009-06-13 A public-private project to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions that was abandoned by the Bush administration is being restarted, Steven Chu, the energy secretary, announced Friday.

The project, known as FutureGen, was dropped in January 2008 because the Bush administration said that costs had doubled to $1.8 billion, from $950 million. A study later found that a math error had caused the increase to be overstated; costs had actually risen 39 percent, to $1.3 billion.

Under the project, a coal plant will be built in Mattoon, Ill., that will store nearly all of its emissions underground, where they cannot contribute to global warming.

“This important step forward for FutureGen reflects this administration’s commitment to rapidly developing carbon capture and sequestration technology as part of a comprehensive plan to create jobs, develop clean energy and reduce climate change pollution,” Mr. Chu said in a statement.

The project does not have a green light yet. The Department of Energy said it and FutureGen would make a final decision early next year, after additional cost assessments. For now, the department is estimating government contributions at slightly more than $1 billion, with most of that coming from stimulus money designated for advancing clean coal technologies. The FutureGen Alliance of large coal producers and users will provide $400 million to $600 million.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, praised the decision to restart the project. “For nearly a year and a half, the people of Illinois have endured delays, reversals and disagreements over costs and funding of FutureGen,” Mr. Durbin said. “Today, patience and perseverance pay off.”

Henry Henderson, the director of the Midwestern program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that from the perspective of climate, it was critical to pursue carbon sequestration projects like FutureGen at a commercial scale.

“We need to get actual experience at scale, and this is a way to do it,” he said.

The plant would test techniques for converting coal to a gas, capturing pollutants and burning the gas for power. The carbon dioxide would be compressed and pumped into deep soil layers. Monitoring devices would test whether any had escaped into the air.
422 2009-06-13 Four men and a woman have been arrested in Panama in a plot to kill a United States drug enforcement agent, prosecutors in New York said Friday. The five, who belonged to a Colombian drug group, were arrested Thursday by Panamanian authorities and were being extradited to the United Sates for prosecution, the acting United States attorney, Lev L. Dassin said in a statement. A criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan said the defendants plotted to kill an informer and an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, but authorities were tipped off by another informer.
423 2009-06-13 The undead showed up on my front lawn around 8:30 the other night. They were hungry.

By the time I had cleared all of the zombies — football zombies, ducky-tube zombies, balloon zombies, zombie bobsled teams and Dr. Zomboss himself — off my lawn, back yard and roof, it was about 9:45 the next morning. Now I was hungry.

That is pretty much all you need to know about Plants vs. Zombies, the hilarious, dangerously addictive, truly ingenious new computer game from PopCap. Any economic recovery in this country will be most threatened not by the complex tides of finance but by the simple loss of millions of hours of office productivity to Plants vs. Zombies’ ravenous hordes.

See, devouring your life in seductive, painless 15-minute increments while you mutter helplessly, “Just one more game,” is what the developers at PopCap do better than anyone else. They have done it with relatively simple Bejeweled, Bookworm, Peggle and Zuma, and now they have almost outdone themselves with Plants vs. Zombies.

This is a game that an 8-year-old should be able to enjoy but also one that will keep awake adults who ought to have more pressing matters on the brain. Then again, the zombies want to eat your brain, so perhaps it makes sense.

The basic setup in Plants vs. Zombies is similar to that of other games in the tower defense genre, which got its start a couple of years ago with Handdrawn Games’ Desktop Tower Defense. The player’s domain is being invaded — in this case by a few dozen varieties of zombies — and the player must repel them with an array of defenses, including peashooters, melon-pults, wall-nuts and fume-shrooms.

But Plants vs. Zombies leaps to the head of the tower defense pack by virtue of its polish, humor, simplicity and seductive strategic depth. The basic campaign mode is masterly in how gently and inexorably it lowers the player into the game’s complexities without ever overwhelming or intimidating.
424 2009-06-13 The Hartford Financial Services Group said Friday that it would take as much as $3.4 billion of federal bailout money and sell up to $750 million of common stock to bolster capital after large losses on investments.

The 199-year-old life and property insurer announced its plans eight days after saying that its chief executive, Ramani Ayer, 62, would retire by the end of the year.

Citing a “continued uncertain economic environment,” Mr. Ayer said the stock sale and taking part in the Troubled Asset Relief Program were important steps in building financial strength and remaining well capitalized.

“The additional funds will help absorb further losses in its investment portfolio and reduce the strain on capital caused by the weak equity markets,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst, Bret Howlett, wrote.

The government gave preliminary approval last month for six big insurers to participate in TARP. So far, Hartford is the only one to accept taxpayer funds.
425 2009-06-13 One reason for the quick rejection, according to competition lawyers in Brussels and a commission spokesman, is that the European Commission did not want to repeat a mistake of the first Microsoft case, when it ordered the software maker in 2004 to sell a version of Windows in Europe without its media player.

Microsoft responded by selling its so-called N version of Windows for the same price as its full version, and consumers rejected the stripped-down system. The remedy also did not significantly improve the lot of competing media players. Microsoft said it sold only a few thousand copies of the N version.

This time, the commission has indicated it may want Microsoft to distribute Windows with competing Web browsers preinstalled and then allow retailers and computer makers to decide from a “ballot screen” menu which browsers to install. About 95 percent of computer operating systems are sold preinstalled on new computers.

“Our focus in this case is that consumers should effectively have the chance to choose from an array of browsers,” a commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said. “The remedy with the ‘N’ version software didn’t work.”

In hindsight, Mr. Todd said the commission should have required Microsoft to sell only a Windows version in Europe without a media player and not allowed the parallel sale of the full version.

In Europe, Microsoft is offering to sell a browserless “E” version of Windows 7, its latest operating system version, which is scheduled to be introduced worldwide Oct. 22. “This means that computer manufacturers and users will be free to install Internet Explorer on Windows 7, or not, as they prefer,” wrote Dave Heiner, the Microsoft deputy general counsel who disclosed the offer, in the company’s blog.

Denis Walbroeck, a competition lawyer at Ashurst in Brussels, said the commission’s rejection indicated it was not looking to settle quickly with Microsoft.

“I am struggling to understand the commission’s behavior here,” Mr. Walbroeck said. “It appears this is headed to a big decision from the commission, a big fine and perhaps a lengthy appeal.”

Since the complaint was initially filed, many of Microsoft’s biggest commercial rivals — Sun Microsystems, Google, Nokia and others — have signed on to the case as legal adversaries.

Microsoft canceled the only hearing scheduled in the case, scheduled for early June, after complaining that many European antitrust officials who could attend the hearing as observers were unable to do so because of a competing conference in Switzerland.

The commission is under no timetable to release its ruling in the browser case, but in the past, it has publicized crucial decisions, fines and sanctions before leaving for its summer break in late July.
426 2009-06-14 After news came that The Boston Globe may be sold, we asked six experts in newspaper valuations what they think the newspaper is worth for a column on the subject. But each gave detailed, thoughtful answers that we thought we would share in full h...
427 2009-06-14 On June 10, an article in The Times explored how Reed College in Oregon, known for academic rigor and a free-spirited student body, has had to make budget cuts and reject some needy applicants. Here is a response to the article from Reed.

I write to provide additional information and context for the June 10th article on Reed College. Although thoroughly researched and well written, some were left with the impression that Reed has changed its financial aid policies or awarded less support to students for the coming year. In fact, the opposite is true. For next year, we increased our financial aid budget by 7.8 percent and offered aid to 14 percent more applicants than we did last year.

Fifty-one percent of Reed students receive aid, with the average annual grant being $32,630. Of this amount, over $30,000 comes from Reed’s endowment and operating budget. The college meets 100 percent of the demonstrated financial aid need for all admitted students, and guarantees that support throughout a student’s career at Reed.

These policies allow the college to enroll a student body of uncommon intellectual passion and talent, and to maintain the academic rigor and intensity for which it is justly famous.
428 2009-06-14 Besides the president, the first lady, Michelle Obama, and at least 10 of the 15 cabinet secretaries addressed commencement ceremonies this spring.

The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, told graduates of Sarah Lawrence College, in Westchester County, N.Y., that as a high school senior he had by accident nearly sliced off a finger, yet had foolishly followed up with a nighttime swim that left him with gangrene, battling for his life.

His point? “Don’t be reckless,” Mr. Emanuel said. “Take what you do and how you live your life seriously.”

Perhaps the most somber admonishment came from Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who warned graduates at Harvard University that if the world pursued business as usual, climate change could be “so rapid that many species will have trouble adapting, including humans.”

Following are excerpts from Mr. Chu’s address and others:

Climate change is not new; the Earth went through six ice ages in the past 600,000 years. However, recent measurements show that the climate has begun to change rapidly. The size of the north polar ice cap in the month of September is only half the size it was a mere 50 years ago. The sea level has been rising since direct measurements began in 1870, but that rate is now five times faster than it was at the beginning. These changes are not due to natural fluctuations. For the first time in human history, science is now making predictions of how our actions today will affect the world 50 and 100 years from now.

Not to bring up something upsetting, but when you leave here today, you may go through a period of unemployment. My suggestion is this: Enjoy the unemployment. Have a second cup of coffee. Go to the park. Read Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman loved being unemployed. I don’t believe he ever did a day’s work in his life. As you may know, he was a poet. If a lot of time goes by and you continue to be unemployed, you may want to consider announcing to all appropriate parties that you have become a poet.

There is no such thing as a self-made man or woman. Never was, never will be. We are all, as were those in whose footsteps we follow, shaped by the influence and examples of countless others — parents, grandparents, friends, rivals. And by those who wrote the music that moves us to our souls, those whose performance on stage or on the playing field took our breaths away, those who wrote the great charters which are the bedrock of our system of self-government. And so many who, to our benefit, struggled and suffered through times of trouble and grave uncertainty. And by teachers. ... I want to stress as emphatically as I can the immeasurable importance of teachers.

You chose a Wellesley grad who spent the first decade of her career broke, begging for freelance work, who constantly heard she was underqualified or, later, overqualified (that means old) or basically just plain wrong for whatever it was she wanted to do. She eventually ended up with a really great job, doing exactly what she wanted to do, exactly where she wanted to do it: in the Middle East. And she got hit by a car bomb; they nearly took her legs off. She had to come back from the dead, roughly five times, and learn how to walk again. So it tells me a lot about you and your current state of mind that you all thought you needed to hear from me, with whatever lessons I had to offer from those experiences, as you leave college for the rest of your life. In short, you all want to know how to be bomb-proof, right? So you’re right: I learned a lot. Most of all, that every time I ran into a wall, I had two choices on how to face it: hope or fear.

You are going to be trying to carve out a career in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. You are, furthermore, going to be trying to do so within what appears to be a dying industry. You have abundant skills and talents; it’s just not clear that anyone wants to pay you for them. Well, you are not alone. How do you think it feels to be an autoworker right now? And I’ve spent time with plenty of laid-off paper mill workers, construction workers and miners. They’ve got skills; they’ve got experience. They just don’t have jobs. So let me be the first to say this to you: Welcome to the American working class.

Our youngest daughter, Catherine, graduated from high school a couple years ago. Sitting at her graduation, I couldn’t help but think about the difference between her journey and my own nearly 35 years earlier. I grew up on welfare on the South Side of Chicago in my grandparents’ two-bedroom tenement. I shared a room and a set of bunk beds with my mother and my sister, who is here today — so we would rotate from the top bunk to the bottom bunk to the floor, every third night on the floor. I went to overcrowded, sometimes violent public schools. I can’t think of a time when I didn’t love to read. But I don’t actually remember ever owning a book until I got my break in 1970, when I came to Massachusetts on a scholarship to boarding school. ... Now, our Catherine, by contrast, has always had her own room, most of that time in a house in a leafy neighborhood outside of Boston. By the time she got to high school, she had already traveled on four continents, she knew how to use and pronounce the “concierge,” and she had shaken hands in the White House with the president of the United States.

I am optimistic about the future because of the inherent drive of men and women to work hard, to achieve, to succeed, to make life better for their children. To do what’s right for the future. Maybe you expect to hear such optimism from a guy who sells a product like Coca-Cola that invites you to “open happiness.” But consider this theme for a moment. Coca-Cola operates in more corners of the world than any other enterprise. It’s been said that after the word “hello,” Coca-Cola is the most recognized word in the world. Our business has chosen the idea of “happiness” as the best way to connect our brand with billions of people in more than 200 countries. Did some marketing guru randomly make that choice? No. It was a thoroughly analyzed decision about what speaks to the aspirations of people today.

Remember that no matter which art you practice, there is no more valuable skill than the ability to listen carefully. Especially when you listen to the music, or listen to the text, listen! They will guide you well.

I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking, What if we could download the whole Web and just keep the links? And I grabbed a pen and started writing. Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my adviser, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the Web. He nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated. Amazingly, I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn’t even on the radar. But much later, we happened upon a better way of ranking Web pages to make a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it.

Over 40 years ago, when I was in my midteens, I announced at home that I had decided to become a lawyer. The first words I heard in response were, “You can’t because you are a woman.” It was the voice of our parish priest. The next voice I heard was my mother’s, saying, “Don’t listen to him.” To my mother’s surprise, I heeded her advice. A couple of years later, the same year that the first human walked on the Moon, I started law school and our first textbook was called “Learning the Law” by a very eminent jurist, Prof. Glanville Williams. In a chapter ominously entitled “Women,” he stated his views that law school was no place for women and that our voices were too weak to be heard in a courtroom. That man had clearly never met my mother. He reckoned the only thing to be gained by having female law students was the opportunity it provided to meet suitable spouses. I married a dentist, just for spite.

You are the Millennials. You differ from Generation X in that you are neither cynical nor alienated, and you seem to like your parents. You’re not like the boomers, who are ideologues and tend to listen only to those who share their ideology. You are seen as being inclusive when it comes to race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. You actually have positive attitudes on the ability of government to play a constructive role in our lives. You want to build coalitions. ... You are networked, and you tweet. And most importantly for our time, you are problem-solvers.

Of all the wonderful things that have happened, including getting a doctorate, an honorary doctorate from Duke, what really makes me feel successful is being able to use my life in service to someone else. And I will have to say, it is a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home, or homes, a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home which just escaped the fire in Santa Barbara. And it is really fantastic to have your own jet, and anybody who says it isn’t is lying to you. That jet thing is really good. But you really haven’t completed the circle of success unless you can help somebody else move forward.

Dissent will be, and should be, part of your lives. This country was born of dissent (the Revolutionary War), defined by it (the Civil War) and changed profoundly by it. The labor, suffrage and civil rights movements as well as the anti-Vietnam protests all come to mind. Dissent is as American as cherry pie. It is also as Oberlinian as — tofu. Whatever you choose to do, wherever you choose to do it, you owe it to your bosses and your conscience to be intellectually honest.

During the Revolution, a man in civilian clothes rode past a redoubt being repaired. The commander was shouting orders but not helping. When the rider asked why, the supervisor of the work detail retorted, “Sir, I am a corporal.” The stranger apologized, dismounted and helped repair the redoubt. When he was done, he turned toward the supervisor and said, “Mr. Corporal, next time you have a job like this, and not enough men to do it, go to your commander in chief, and I will come and help you again.” Too late, the corporal recognized George Washington. The power of example in leadership.

Sometimes you just have to jump off the cliff without knowing where you will land. Sixteen years ago, I jumped. It was 1993. I was 23 years old and horrified by what I was seeing in the news about rape camps in Bosnia. I couldn’t find anyone doing something about the astounding injustices women were experiencing, so I decided to do something myself. I cannot tell you how many people ridiculed my efforts. I was not getting paid, and a lot of people said: “Stop doing that. Go get a real job, and get paid.” ... At 25 years old I was honored by President Clinton at a White House ceremony for my grass-roots work. Even then I would not have imagined that 15 years later, Women for Women would be assisting hundreds of thousands of women in countries all around the world. ... If I, an immigrant woman from Iraq with no money, can do this, you can too.
429 2009-06-14 State and local investigations into Pedro Espada Jr., who claimed the title of Senate president in a coup last week, are broader than previously reported. Law enforcement officials are reviewing records of taxpayer-financed travel, campaign records and legislative earmarks, as well as Mr. Espada’s residency, people with knowledge of the investigations said Saturday.

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo has been working with Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, for months. The parallel inquiries are focused on several areas, according to people who have been briefed on the investigations but spoke on condition of anonymity because the cases are continuing.

Both are said to be examining attempts by Mr. Espada — who was elected Senate president on Monday, although his elevation was being challenged in court — to direct legislative earmarks to a Bronx nonprofit group that he founded, Soundview HealthCare Network. The investigation has also focused on whether Soundview, which Mr. Espada still serves as chief executive, has misappropriated money. Questions also continue to be raised as to whether Soundview employees have engaged in political activities on Mr. Espada’s behalf.

Investigators are also examining whether Mr. Espada actually makes his primary residence in the Bronx district that he represents; he spends much of his time at a home in Mamaroneck, in Westchester County. While it was previously known that Mr. Johnson was reviewing the residency issue, Mr. Cuomo is as well. The attorney general would have jurisdiction if state filings were falsified.

Mr. Espada and another Senate Democrat, Hiram Monserrate of Queens, bolted the caucus on Monday, allowing Republicans to retake control of the Senate. As Senate president, Mr. Espada would become acting governor if Gov. David A. Paterson were incapacitated or left office.
430 2009-06-14 “Not till you mention it,” he said. “Not really. Not when I’m out there, I don’t think about it. I mean it’s a major. I’d love to play in it. I expected to be off next week.”

He added: “I’ve got enough work to do here to not have to worry about that. Nothing I need to think about.”

Phil Mickelson shot a 68 and was 10 shots back at 206 in his first event since announcing his wife’s diagnosis of breast cancer. He still was not happy with his putter.

“I haven’t putted well the first three days,” Mickelson said. “I feel like I’ve struck the ball well but have not been able to get it in the hole and shoot a number, a good low number and mostly because of the putter. I’ll spend some time on that in the next few days and should be able to get it ironed out for next week.”

John Daly’s comeback to the PGA Tour stretched into the weekend as he made the cut in this storm-delayed event on the line at even par. He shot a 71 in the third round and was one over.

Robert Allenby (68) was alone in third at 199, followed by Paul Goydos (64). Woody Austin (68) was in a group tied for fifth at 201.

Gay came into this event among seven players who had a chance to earn a spot in the field at Bethpage with a victory. He won at Hilton Head by 10 strokes but insists that was not his goal here.

He has led by a stroke after each of the first three rounds. He had five birdies Saturday and went as low as 15 under, ahead by as many as three strokes.

His putting has been the key. He followed up 23 putts in the second round with 24. Gay has had 73 putts through 54 holes, but Molder and Allenby have played almost as well.

Molder, a Nationwide Tour qualifier, is not ready to give up a chance at what would be his first PGA Tour victory. His best finish was third in Reno, Nev., in 2001.

“The golf ball doesn’t know about the history of either one of us, so just go play,” Molder said.

Gay and Molder avoided having to return Saturday morning to wrap up the second round, which was stopped Friday because of a storm that took down part of a tree near the 15th hole.

A forecast of more storms expected Sunday afternoon caused organizers to move up tee times for the final round and send threesomes off the front and back tees.
431 2009-06-14 I WAS born in the Philippines, where there’s a strong entrepreneurial spirit that is about more than just money. You just go into business and help yourself. That could mean running a jitney or selling fruit on the street.

My father founded a construction company, and my grandmother had many businesses, including a pharmacy. Even when I was a small child, she made it clear that I was expected to make something of my career.

I studied piano seriously throughout my childhood and adolescence. But by the time I came to the United States to attend Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., I knew I wanted to go into business. After taking every single economics class at Manhattanville, I enrolled in extra courses at Fordham.

Two weeks after graduation, I started a job in corporate finance at Bache & Company. I spent six months on a transaction for Levitz Furniture. Then, because I was from Manila, I was recruited to help open the branch office there. At 21, I became the sole broker and assistant manager of that office, hiring and training more than 20 people.

For the next two years, I sold equities, traded commodities and did arbitrage. Manila has a 12-hour time difference from New York, so I would be at my desk and on the phone at 2 in the morning. I wore miniskirts to work, which horrified my father. Perhaps unlike a lot of young women, I never felt the need to turn myself into a man and wear pinstripes to be successful.

But I realized I wasn’t a trader at heart. You need a stomach of steel to lose money and not take it personally. I saw clients’ losses and became an emotional wreck. So when the Philippine business environment became tougher for American firms and the office closed down, I went back to New York and got a job in investment banking at Merrill Lynch, covering public utilities.
432 2009-06-14 DeMarre Carroll was beginning his first season at Missouri two years ago when he was annoyed by itchy legs. Convinced he was allergic to something, he visited several doctors until he received a much different explanation: liver disease.

The diagnosis was kept quiet and Carroll hardly looked ill on the court, earning a slew of awards and helping the Tigers go deep in last season’s N.C.A.A. tournament.

After his medical condition was finally revealed this month — with the news that he might need a liver transplant in 20 to 25 years — Carroll wants it known that it will not stop his N.B.A. career.

“It hasn’t been a factor, and from what the doctor told me it isn’t going to be a factor until later down my road — if it ever is,” Carroll said Friday after a predraft workout with the Charlotte Bobcats. “I think it’s blown out of proportion.”

Reports of Carroll’s condition came as he was ascending on draft boards after individual workouts. There was talk that he could jump into the first round. Carroll, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged a team-best 16.8 points and 7.2 rebounds last season as Missouri won a program-record 31 games before losing in the West Regional final.
433 2009-06-14 His 20-year marriage is in the process of dissolving, and that has weighed on him, as has the precarious health of his ever-present physical therapist, Cindi Hilfman. It has been a challenge under the circumstances for Mediate, who has three sons, to stay in the moment.

“I’m trying,” he said. “It’s just hard.”

Because his popularity was built on his affability, Mediate is allowed no room to brood in public. He is expected to have a smile and a signature for everyone he meets. “He always has to be on,” his agent, Frank Zoracki, said.

At the Memorial Tournament, his final tuneup for the United States Open starting June 18 at Bethpage Black, Mediate was walking toward the parking lot after a practice round. Hilfman had awakened that morning with a fever and Mediate wanted to get her back to the hotel without delay.

He asked if he could answer a reporter’s questions as he walked, his smile growing tighter with every stride as fans kept interrupting him as he talked.

He has found no relief inside the ropes. In 21 official PGA Tour events since last year’s Open, Mediate’s best finish is a tie for 18th. “I’ve played very consistently mediocre since then,” Mediate said.

He attributes much of his success at Torrey Pines to Hilfman, whom he sought out in the winter of 2007 to treat a career-threatening back problem. He considers Hilfman, who is married to Greg Hilfman, a keyboardist for the rock group The Bangles, much more than his physical therapist; he has described her as his best friend and business partner.

Hilfman was with Mediate all week at Torrey Pines. She ministered to his back and followed Monday’s playoff from inside the ropes.

Hilfman, 43, has become Mediate’s regular traveling companion, and he has been there during her frequent hospitalizations for a congenital kidney disease. Mediate played rounds in two tournaments toward the end of last season after spending the night in the hospital with Hilfman when her condition worsened.

In an e-mail message, Hilfman’s husband, Greg, said, “Cindi loves the golf world and interfacing with Rocco’s entourage.” He added, “It’s sometimes challenging to be husband #2, but I think Roc’s a cool guy.”

Mediate’s book chronicles the Open, which made him an overnight star 24 years in the making. It skims his past, including his courtship and marriage to the former Linda Newell, the birth of their sons and the difficulties in their relationship that led them to discuss divorce for several years before deciding to end their marriage last year.

Linda Mediate and their sons did not attend the Open last year, when the fourth round fell on Father’s Day. They watched the telecast at home in Florida.

In the book Linda Mediate is quoted as saying, “A big part of me was thrilled because I knew he had dreamed of being in this situation.” She added: “But I couldn’t help but feel sad that none of us was there with him on Father’s Day. That part was tough.”

The book project, Mediate said, “was a lot of fun.” He added, “I found things out about myself that I didn’t even know.” He gave the example of a friend who was quoted as saying he never understood what made Mediate believe he would have success as a professional golfer.

Mediate, a five-time winner on the PGA Tour, acknowledged it has been an improbable journey. “Something happened,” he said, “and I’m still here.”

He arrives at Bethpage with an eye toward scripting a sequel. His goal is to place himself in contention again and this time get the ending right.

“I’d love to have that opportunity,” he said. “It would be a heck of a Chapter Two.”
434 2009-06-14 The Golden Eagles (40-24) are this year’s feel-good story. Once considered out of the postseason race, Southern Mississippi pulled off a string of improbable victories with grit and spunk. It has been an emotional run since Coach Corky Palmer announced his retirement in April.

At the time, it looked as if Southern Mississippi’s streak of six regionals would end. But an appearance in the Conference USA championship game gave the team the boost it needed to sneak into the N.C.A.A. tournament. Since then, Davis and his teammates have found ways to get out of every jam and deficit.

Texas (46-14-1) may be Southern Mississippi’s toughest challenge yet.

“I think the thing that makes them special is that pitching will wear you down,” Palmer said. “You don’t want to be behind when that closer gets in. He’s tough.” He was referring to Austin Wood.

The Longhorns will walk with a swagger into Rosenblatt Stadium. Their staff earned run average is a suffocating 2.84, and opponents are batting .222 against them.

Wood, a fifth-round pick by the Detroit Tigers in the Major League Baseball draft, is 5-1 with 15 of the Longhorns’ 18 saves. He is one of nine Texas pitchers with an earned run average of 3.52 or less.

“Confident” was a word uttered often by Texas players this week.

“I feel really confident going up there and I think we’re going to have a really special time up there,” said the freshman Austin Dicharry, who was 8-2 this season with a 2.40 E.R.A. “I’m not really nervous. It’s on a bigger stage, of course, but I think we’re going to handle it just fine.”

First, though, the Texas pitchers will have to handle Davis, something opponents have struggled to do. He is hitting .371, leads the team in slugging percentage (.649) and has an on-base percentage of .488.

He has 14 home runs, 10 steals, 53 runs batted in and has more walks (43) than strikeouts (40).

“Bo first of all is like a five-tool guy,” his fellow senior Brian Dozier said. “He can hit for power and doubles, but he’s also got the speed to be a leadoff hitter. Hitting two hole behind him is really awesome to me because of the fact when he gets on base so much, he’s a threat to steal, so you get a lot of fastballs.”

The success of Southern Mississippi in Omaha will be tied to Davis’s performance. Palmer said he trusted Davis completely and intended to let him have free rein to hit or steal during the series.

For Palmer, it has always been “however he feels that at-bat, judging how the pitcher’s pitching him, whether he’s more aggressive or takes pitches.”

He added, “Being a fifth-year senior, being in the program and being a third-year starter, he knows what he’s doing and I’ve got a lot of faith in him.”
435 2009-06-14 Anderson, a four-time champion of a century ago, won in 1903 at Baltusrol, in Springfield, N.J., which is as close to, say, Times Square as Winged Foot in Westchester County and much closer than the other two New York courses in the recent Open rotation — Shinnecock Hills and Bethpage Black on Long Island.

One of the eight New York-area Open courses has moved and another no longer exists. Fresh Meadow, where Sarazen won in 1932, moved in 1946 from Flushing to Lake Success. The Englewood Golf Club in New Jersey, where George Sargent won in 1909, was dug up nearly three decades ago to make way for Interstate 95 and clusters of condominiums not far from the George Washington Bridge.

Opens in the New York area have reflected golf’s history and growth, beginning in 1896 at the second United States Open when James Foulis, a transplanted Scot from St. Andrews, won at Shinnecock Hills. Six years later, Laurie Auchterlonie, another Scot from St. Andrews, was the first to break 80 in all four rounds while winning at the Garden City Golf Club.

Travers, a New York amateur, took the 1915 Open at Baltusrol, and Jones, golf’s most celebrated amateur, won in 1923 at Inwood across Jamaica Bay from what is now Kennedy International Airport. In 1929 at Winged Foot, Jones holed a curling 12-foot putt on the final green to force a 36-hole playoff with Al Espinosa. Shooting 72-69, Jones won it by 23 strokes.

After Sarazen, the inventor of the sand wedge, won at Fresh Meadow in 1932, Tony Manero won on Baltusrol’s Upper Course in 1936. In 1954 on the Lower Course, the first Open with fairway gallery ropes, Ed Furgol won after a hooked tee shot into the tree-lined 18th fairway of the Upper Course on his final hole.

At Winged Foot in 1959, Casper enhanced his reputation as a superb putter, needing only 114 putts, including 31 one-putt greens, and only one three-putt green. Eight years later, Nicklaus, with a final-round 65 at Baltusrol, held off Arnold Palmer, who shot 69, to win by four. In 1980, with Jack Is Back lettering on the leader board near the 18th green, Nicklaus defeated Isao Aoki by two strokes.

Irwin survived Winged Foot’s severe rough in 1974 with a seven-over-par 287, and in 1984 Zoeller routed Greg Norman in a playoff there, 67 to 75. Two years later, in a return to Shinnecock Hills after 90 years, Floyd won a shootout with a final-round 66. At Baltusrol in 1993, Lee Janzen won with a record-tying four rounds in the 60s, then Pavin won at Shinnecock Hills in 1995.

After Woods edged Phil Mickelson by three shots at Bethpage Black in 2002, Goosen prevailed at Shinnecock Hills in 2004, winning by two after Mickelson had a double bogey on the short next-to-last hole. In 2006 Ogilvy won at Winged Foot after Mickelson, leading by one, sliced his final-hole drive off a hospitality tent into the rough, then hit a tree en route to a double-bogey.

After having hosted three Opens in five years and now four in eight, the New York area is not likely to get another until 2017 at the earliest. But at Bethpage Black this week the history of the New York Open will be enriched by one of the best of the best golfers, if not by the best of the best himself.
436 2009-06-14 DeVos’s goal is to have the Magic be a legacy and heritage team. Bob Vander Weide, the Magic’s president, is also DeVos’s son-in-law. He has been groomed to be the next patriarch of the organization. He already handles most of its day-to-day affairs.

“There just aren’t many family teams left anymore,” said DeVos, who had a heart transplant 12 years ago. “My years are few remaining. The plans are being made financially that we can do that. The grandchildren are being told this is not something you buy and sell. This is something you respect and take care of.”

With the Magic trailing the Los Angeles Lakers in the N.B.A. finals, three games to one, its goal of bringing the city its first N.B.A. title may fall short. Even so, there is palpable excitement here created by the organization, its young star Dwight Howard and the prospect of a new arena on the horizon.

Before Game 3 of the finals Tuesday, DeVos walked the arena’s corridors and greeted everyone. At this stage of his life, he is less a commander than a cheerleader for the organization. He still talks to his players, dispensing advice about life more than about basketball. Before each season, the players visit DeVos at his home in Boca Raton.

This is the Magic’s first appearance in the N.B.A. finals since 1995, when the franchise was in only its sixth season. It was a perhaps premature accomplishment buoyed by a dominating young center named Shaquille O’Neal. DeVos was accustomed to winning in life. To him and his family, the early finals appearance fell nicely in line with everything that had come before it.

“It came so fast that you thought this was almost routine,” DeVos said. “We didn’t appreciate it enough when it happened. And we weren’t into it enough to enjoy it. It all felt like it was just another game, just another step in the process.”

Instead of stepping forward, the Magic stepped back. O’Neal soon crossed the country and joined the Lakers. Orlando had been his first job. And DeVos had often discussed his excitement and expectations.

“It hurt Orlando a lot,” DeVos said of O’Neal’s departure, then repeated his statement for emphasis.

“I spent a lot of time talking to him about the wisdom of staying in Orlando,” he said. “But he had stars in his eyes. It wasn’t money. It was the glitter of L.A.”

The N.B.A. had yet to establish its current collective bargaining agreement and teams and players did not have the financial incentives now in place to keep them together. The Lakers signed O’Neal to a seven-year, $121 million contract — a package, Vander Weide said, that the Magic exceeded.

“We offered Shaq $18 million more than the Lakers,” Vander Weide said. “It’s not like we were being cheap or weren’t trying to keep Shaq as a player and as an asset to this franchise.”

The Magic then hatched a plan to acquire two of the most enticing free agents available, setting its sights on Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. It eventually landed Hill and McGrady. But the plan looked better on paper than on the court because Hill struggled with injuries throughout his time with the team.

“Nobody ever thought that Grant would get reinjured and that was tough,” Vander Weide said. “It was a good plan. We created a lot of cap room and Dad has always been on the front end of strategically where are we going. But sometimes plans don’t work because of health.”

As an owner, DeVos can veto player selections and mandates that the organization stays below the luxury-tax threshold — which may become an issue if Hedo Turkoglu opts for free agency.

“But I’m not close enough to the game to tell them much of anything but to watch the money,” DeVos said. “An N.B.A. team in a small town doesn’t make money. You have to be able to hold a team without it returning money to you in your ownership. The only way a small-town team makes money is when you sell it.”

He contemplated that possibility and nearly sold the franchise earlier this decade. The Magic had fallen below expectations. There were tax problems and, perhaps most important, DeVos wondered if his family cared about the team as something more than a hobby.

On a whim, DeVos changed his mind. And as he walked the corridor of Amway Arena with his family Thursday evening, he did so in the same way he has for years, the cane the only addition.

“He always had a saying of ‘Why not us? Why not now?’ ” said Nick Anderson, a former Magic player who is now the team’s community ambassador. “He still says that today, and that has resonated.”
437 2009-06-14 But while ranking college pitchers is fairly straightforward, converting their statistics to major league equivalents is much more challenging. No two programs have the same schedule, and only a handful of players have gone straight from college to the majors, meaning there is little data for a direct comparison.

To overcome these obstacles, analysts are forced to resort to the quantitative equivalent of duct tape and super glue to estimate the quality of college competition. Most statistical indicators say nothing about the overall level of play in a league: if both the pitchers and hitters at one level are better than those in another, their performances will cancel out. But a few figures avoid this effect, such as error rate (which measures the quality of the fielders) and the frequency of hit batsmen (which measures pitchers’ control). These numbers, taken together, can provide a quick approximation of a league’s strength. They suggest that Strasburg faced opposition roughly comparable to that of a middling Class A minor league squad.

Using those sketchy parameters, Boras’s assertion that Strasburg is a major-league-ready talent seems to be more than just a negotiating ploy. According to Clay Davenport of Baseball Prospectus, had Strasburg been pitching for Washington instead of San Diego State this year, he would have compiled a 3.54 E.R.A. (which would rank 18th among qualifiers in the National League) and struck out 9.3 batters per nine innings (good for ninth). By contrast, Prior’s college numbers were consistent with a 3.89 major league E.R.A., and Weaver’s with a 4.51.

That does not guarantee that Strasburg will produce similar numbers for the Nationals. Even if he stays healthy, he could simply have had a career year at age 20. But it does suggest he would be at worst an above-average major league starter right now. Pitchers often develop more quickly than hitters — just look at what Dwight Gooden and Kerry Wood achieved at 20 — and given their propensity to get hurt, every pitch an elite prospect throws to overmatched minor league batters is one that is wasted by the big club. Because the Nationals have only one starter with an E.R.A. under 5.00, they may be well advised to put Strasburg on their roster as soon as they can sign him.

Signing him, of course, will not be easy. But it is important to remember that amateur draftees, because they lack the leverage to negotiate with other clubs, are generally paid far less than the value they generate for their employers. Strasburg is almost certainly comparable to the second tier of last year’s free-agent starters, which included A. J. Burnett, Derek Lowe and Ryan Dempster, all of whom received contracts worth around $15 million a year. Whatever Washington winds up paying Strasburg will still be less than the cost of acquiring a similarly valuable veteran.

Buckling to Boras’s demands is obviously unpleasant. And Commissioner Bud Selig will surely pressure the Nationals to avoid establishing a new salary scale for amateurs, who represent the single biggest source of profit for the owners. But losing the rights to Strasburg over a few million dollars would epitomize being penny wise and pound foolish.
438 2009-06-14 Emily Marie Haefner and Alexander Freeman Young were married Saturday at All Saints Catholic Church in Madison Lake, Minn. The Rev. Tim Biren, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.

Mrs. Young, 30, is a photographer and the Los Angeles regional manager for Bella Baby Photography. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin.

She is a daughter of Theresa M. Haefner and Scott P. Haefner of Mankato, Minn. Her father is an owner of Neubert Millwork Company in North Mankato, Minn., which specializes in custom-made woodwork. Her mother works from home as a clothing buyer for the Nebraska Book Company, which serves college book stores.

Mr. Young, also 30, is the vice president for feature film development and production at Josephson Entertainment, a film and television production company in Los Angeles. He graduated from Tulane.

He is a son of Carol F. Young and Richard A. Young of Greenwich, Conn. His father retired as a senior partner in Martin Clearwater & Bell, the New York law firm.
439 2009-06-14 Emily Marie Allen and Samuel Roosevelt Hornblower were married Saturday at St. Patrick Church in Wallingford, Vt. The Rev. Carney Gavin, a Roman Catholic priest and the bride’s godfather, performed the ceremony in which the Rev. Justin Baker, also a Roman Catholic priest, participated.

In September, the bride, 30, is to become an assistant professor in the classics department of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. She received a diploma from the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and received two master’s degrees in classics from the Sorbonne. She also holds a Ph.D. in classical philology from Harvard.

She is the daughter of Annelyse M. Allen and Frederick H.S. Allen of Wallingford. Her father was the executive secretary of the International Council at JPMorgan Chase, a group of business leaders and prominent individuals that advise the bank’s senior management on matters relating to its global business. He is now an independent consultant in New York who advises institutions on international cultural events. Her mother is a freelance writer and translator in Wallingford.

The bridegroom, 31, is an associate producer at “60 Minutes.” He was the associate producer of a report that won a Peabody Award for investigating rape allegations against Duke University lacrosse players in 2007. He graduated cum laude from Harvard.

He is the son of Margot Roosevelt of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Ralph Hornblower III of New York. The bridegroom’s mother is a staff writer for The Los Angeles Times.

The bridegroom is a maternal great-great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt.
440 2009-06-14 WASHINGTON  The White House said Saturday that President Obama intended to pay for his health care overhaul partly by cutting more than $200 billion in expected reimbursements to hospitals over the next decade  a proposal that is likely to provoke a backlash from struggling medical institutions around the country.

Mr. Obama has insisted that his plan will not add to the federal deficit. He had already set aside in his budget what he calls a $635 billion “down payment” toward the overall 10-year cost of the overhaul, expected to top $1 trillion. But Republicans and some Democratic legislators have been pressing him to provide details on how he would cover the rest. On Saturday, he used his Internet and radio address to do so.

Mr. Obama said he had identified “an additional $313 billion in savings that will rein in unnecessary spending and increase efficiency and the quality of care,” bringing the total to nearly $950 billion. He did not offer a specific breakdown, but advisers said that in addition to the more than $200 billion in lowered hospital reimbursements, the president expected $75 billion in savings over 10 years by getting better prices for prescription drugs, and $22 billion in other savings.

“These savings will come from common-sense changes,” Mr. Obama said in his address. “For example, if more Americans are insured, we can cut payments that help hospitals treat patients without health insurance.”

He added: “If the drug makers pay their fair share, we can cut government spending on prescription drugs. And if doctors have incentives to provide the best care instead of more care, we can help Americans avoid the unnecessary hospital stays, treatments and tests that drive up costs.”

Saturday’s announcement came amid an intense push by the White House to sell Mr. Obama’s health care plan, his highest legislative priority. Broadly speaking, Mr. Obama wants to extend coverage to the nation’s 45 million uninsured, preserve consumer choice and cut rising health care costs. He has argued that fixing the nation’s health care system is crucial to the economic health of the United States.

But as Congress contemplates the details of the legislation, the question of how to pay for the plan is among the thorniest it will face. Already, one of Mr. Obama’s early proposals  limiting tax deductions for high-income people  has run into major roadblocks on Capitol Hill. By providing details in his weekly address on Saturday, Mr. Obama may be hoping to give lawmakers the political leeway to adopt other cost-saving measures.

The administration expects to achieve the lowered hospital payments in two major ways, by slowing the growth of reimbursements. First, said Mr. Obama’s budget director, Peter M. Orszag, payments to hospitals will be reduced to try to encourage them to work more productively and efficiently.

Mr. Orszag said hospitals could figure out ways of treating patients “more effectively, through health information technology, a nurse coordinator instead of an unnecessary specialist,” for example. These “productivity adjustments” would account for $110 billion in savings.

Second, the administration expects to lower payments to hospitals that treat large numbers of low-income patients. Medicare and Medicaid make special extra payments to these hospitals, but Mr. Orszag said those payments would become less necessary over time, as more of the nation’s 45 million uninsured acquire coverage through the new program. This would account for $106 billion in savings.

But hospital administrators, already nervous about lowered reimbursements, are likely to oppose such cuts. Less than 24 hours before Mr. Obama’s radio address, the president of the American Hospital Association, Richard J. Umbdenstock, issued a call to action to his members across the country, warning that Congress might cut provider payments.

Mr. Umbdenstock asked hospitals to “push back” against the proposed cuts. “Payment cuts are not reform,” he said, denouncing “blunt cuts that cripple hospitals’ ability to do better for their patients.”

Dr. Patricia A. Gabow, chief executive of the Denver Health and Hospital Authority, which operates a 477-bed public hospital, said it would be “pretty risky” for Congress to cut payments to safety-net hospitals before knowing whether new legislation actually reduced the uncompensated care they must provide.

“What about homeless people, the chronically mentally ill, substance abusers and people with low literacy?” Dr. Gabow asked. “You think they will be using the federal health insurance exchange to enroll in insurance plans? I don’t think so.”

Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the proposed cuts could be “devastating to hospitals that serve inner-city communities.”

Mr. Raske pointed out that none of the major proposals in Congress would provide health insurance to illegal immigrants, and many of them would still be unable to pay their hospital bills. In addition, he said, the federal payments will still be needed because “Medicaid woefully underpays for outpatient clinics” and other services in some states, including New York.

Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, intends to introduce his plan this week. Aides said it would include a proposal to tax some employer-provided health benefits, a notion that Mr. Obama sharply criticized during his campaign for the White House. Workers might, for example, have to pay income tax on the value of family coverage exceeding $15,000 a year.

Labor unions, many employers and many House Democrats oppose such a tax, saying it would destabilize the employer-based system of health insurance.
441 2009-06-14 I popped into the kitchen and then popped back out with a coaster and ice water for Mark in one of our few glasses that wasn’t a jar.

I thought I saw Mark glance at the holes in the table and give a bemused shrug as he placed the coaster over them. But chances are I was giving Mark too much credit for having a sense of irony; he didn’t display one note of it in the hour that followed.

“Now let me get a sense of your current situation,” he said, reaching down to his briefcase, his face disappearing behind his jacket collar as he retrieved a yellow legal pad.

“Well, I’ve got about $120,000 worth of student-loan debt,” Pat said. Mark scribbled the figure onto the pad. “We’ve got $20,000 in credit card debt. We owe all our doctors, and Brett has $12,000 in student-loan debt as well.”

“Nope,” Pat said. “We bought the Nissan outright. Had to. I don’t think we’d pass a credit check.”

“Have you ever checked your credit score?”

“You might be surprised. If you keep up with your credit card payments — —”

“Oh, we do,” Pat said proudly. “We keep up with the payments.”

Pat was answering all the questions because I didn’t have a clue how much we owed on the credit cards. Pat had been the sole bill-payer for the last four years, and I had found that I was a much calmer person when I didn’t look at bills or bank statements. All I knew was that Pat had recently switched to Quicken and loved the pie charts.

“The first thing you should do is find out your credit score,” Mark said.

“Doesn’t it cost money to find out?” Pat said.

“I figured I’d find out when I needed to. When we have some money.”

Mark’s face betrayed no reaction to what I was sure sounded like sheer fiscal lunacy. I wondered if he had made the connection that in our world, the tree falling in the woods didn’t make a sound if you put yourself way out of earshot and thought about something else.

“Let’s move on,” Mark said. “What are your assets?”

“Pat has a coin collection, and we have a couple of antiques,” I said. This was something Pat and I had actually thought about. Occasionally, we spent an evening walking around our apartment, glasses of wine in hand, adding up how much we thought we could get for everything.

“I was talking more about a savings account: stocks, bonds. What’s your income?”

“Our income varies,” Pat said. “Right now, Brett isn’t making anything, and I make anywhere from $2,000 a month, as a stand-in, to $1,200 a month on unemployment. So far, the stand-in work is holding. Sometimes I get a commercial. In January I made $15,000 on a Six Flags spot. It’s up and down.”

“Well, here’s something I can tell you about saving,” Mark said. He proceeded to tell us what stocks and bonds were. What C.D.’s were. And what mutual funds were.

I didn’t know what we would be actually investing since we never had money left after paying the bills. But he had been in our living room for 20 minutes and was on a roll. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that we hadn’t planned on any investing with actual money right now. We had simply thought that maybe we should know what options were out there if we did make some money some day. Just not today. Today there wasn’t any.

“So does all that make sense to you?” Mark asked, tapping his graph of lines.

“Let’s put it this way,” Mark continued. “How much do you think you could manage to put away a month? A couple hundred?”

Fifty? What on earth was Pat thinking? I could only imagine he was attempting to cheer Mark up by appearing to consider opening up some kind of account. If so, I didn’t think Pat had thought this through. Wouldn’t Mark leave even more dejected if he experienced the thrill of landing an account only to realize we had no money to put into it?

When I searched Pat’s face, however, I gleaned nothing but genuine interest. I was stunned. Were we going to commit to something? Right now? I happened to know that we had a little left over at the moment. But that money was already earmarked for a couple of doctor bills and new underwear (the elastic on mine crackled every time I leaned forward).

“O.K., 50,” Mark said. He flipped over the page of lines, swiped his hand across the fresh page and started to write. “Here’s what 50 a month looks like when you put it into mutual funds.”

Pat fixed his eyes on Mark’s pencil scratching furiously across the page. I supposed the worst thing that could happen would be that we’d throw $50 into some fund today and it would simply sit there as a limp monument to the best of fiscal intentions immediately thwarted by our unwillingness to change habit. It was a relatively small price to pay to relearn an essential truth: we were incapable of living normal financial lives. We were not owners, we were renters. We were not savers, we were scrapers.

“Got it,” Pat said. “So mutual funds are what we want, right?”

I interrupted, “Shouldn’t we be sure that we can get the money back out?”

“What I’m thinking,” Mark said, “is that you wouldn’t be taking the money out until retirement.”

“Sure. Right now you’re going to have nothing when you retire. What will you live on? Have you thought about that?”

The truth was we hadn’t. I mean, what would we be retiring from? Artsy people, without real jobs, don’t retire. They keep on doing their artsy thing until they die, preferably in the midst of doing their said artsy thing.

“If you put $50 a month into a Roth I.R.A., which is mutual funds, you could...”

PAT and I looked at Mark scratching numbers again onto his legal pad. He vanished behind his collar again, leaning down to reach into his briefcase; then he reappeared with a calculator.

“Yup,” he said. “At $50 a month, starting today, at retirement, you would have income to live at your present level for two years. Provided, you already owned your house.”

“At our present level?” I added. “When did we buy the house?”

“If you could see your way around to 100 a month,” said Mark, breezing by my query, “you might be able to stretch it to five.”

I stared at Mark. Mark stared at his pad. I stared at Pat. Pat stared out the window. I stared out the window. Moments like this made me feel light with helplessness. The problem at hand was too large to manage, the past unalterable, the future unknowable or, worse, bleak. And my only response was to give over, to become vapor, and to drift off into a funk of unknown depth and duration.

Which is just what I was doing when I heard Pat exclaim, “Let’s do it!” And his words reeled me back.

Never mind that my husband’s enthusiasm had no basis in reality. It buoyed me anyway. I felt suddenly grateful for the carpeted floor, the holes in our table, Mark’s yellow pad, the chirping of my son as he awoke in the next room. And for Pat. Because here’s the thing about marriage, or at least about ours: a little blind optimism can take you a long way (thousands of dollars into debt, apparently). But it can also keep you together.

Pat jumped up, strode over to the computer, and popped Quicken on the screen. “Fifty a month,” he said. “At least we’ll have something.”

Yes, I thought. And we have so much already!

His new clients firmly in hand, Mark smiled. “Now here’s the company I’d recommend.”
442 2009-06-14 Any article addressing films about food that neglects “Our Daily Bread” (2005), a powerful Austrian documentary by Nikolaus Geyrhalter on industrialized agricultural practices, is doing a disservice to the readers.

While formally distant from normal American filmmaking practices, this work exposes current food production processes in a manner likely far more unsettling than those American films cited. The film has been shown widely on the festival circuit and was broadcast in Europe. There is really no excuse for overlooking it aside from the usual American cultural navel gazing.
443 2009-06-14 "Elvis," he said, "is going to be bigger than the president, bigger than the pope."

Stoller The Colonel had the kind of energy that sucked all the air out of the room, even the dining room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. I had little interest in the man. Elvis was the guy we were eager to meet. The session was due to start later that week.

Leiber My heterosexual credits have long been established, so I can comfortably say that the first thing that hit me when I walked into the recording studio and found myself standing next to Elvis Presley was his physical beauty. Far more than his pictures, his actual presence was riveting. He had a shy smile and quiet manner that were disarming.

All this happened at Radio Recorders Annex, the same studio where Big Mama had recorded "Hound Dog" back in August of 1952. Elvis wanted us there to produce the songs for the soundtrack we'd written for him.

Stoller It's important to remember that on the day we met Elvis, he was twenty-two and we were twenty-four. We were contemporaries. Remember, too, that Jerry and I shared the uppity view that he and I were among the few white guys who knew about the blues. In the first five minutes of conversation with Elvis, we learned we were dead wrong.

Elvis knew the blues. He was a Ray Charles fanatic and even knew that Ray had sung our song "The Snow Is Falling." In fact, he knew virtually all of our songs. There wasn't any R&B he didn't know. He could quote from Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup, B.B. King, and Big Bill Broonzy.

Leiber When it came to the blues, Elvis knew his stuff. He may not have been conversant about politics or world history, but his blues knowledge was almost encyclopedic. Mike and I were blown away. In fact, the conversation got so enthusiastic that Mike and Elvis sat down at the piano and started playing four-handed blues. He definitely felt our passion for the real roots material and shared that passion with all his heart. Just like that, we fell in love with the guy.

"Let's get started," Elvis said. "Let's cut some records."

We jumped right into "Jailhouse Rock." The initial idea was just to show up at the studio to meet Elvis. But, as naturally as the winter turns to spring, we found ourselves in charge of the session. We were producing the guy. Mike worked out the arrangement with Elvis's band — Bill Black on upright bass, Scotty Moore on guitar, D.J. Fontana on drums, and Dudley Brooks on piano. As far as the vocals went, I was amazed to see that Elvis was happy to hear me sing the song with what I considered the right attitude. He was following my vocal cues.

Stoller Elvis was completely open and never acted like a diva. When it was time to do the actual recording, Jerry was in the control booth and I stayed on the floor. I played piano on one cut, and Jerry, with his unique style of body language, conducted Elvis's vocals.

The other thing that amazed us was that no one was rushing us to get through. During a recording session, Jerry and I were used to watching the clock. The musicians' union allowed four songs in three hours or you got into the dreaded overtime. On Elvis's sessions, though, those restrictions were lifted. The Jordanaires (Elvis's backup vocal quartet), the guys in the band and Elvis's paid companions (the so-called Memphis Mafia) would order lunch — peanut butter sandwiches and orange pop — while the clock kept ticking.

Sometimes we'd do two or three takes on a song; sometimes up to twenty-five. And yet, even in this relaxed atmosphere, by evening time we'd cut three songs.

At the end of the day, Elvis was as high on the music as Jerry and I. That was a Wednesday. Elvis didn't show up at the studio on Thursday, but he was back on Friday to do the fourth song, "(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care."

Leiber The fourth song was the most fun because by then Elvis was deep into our producing style. Our style wasn't anything more than being loose and having fun.

Elvis's initial shyness had totally melted away and he was completely in the spirit of the music. He actually picked up an electric bass and kicked off the intro to "Baby I Don't Care." It also pleased me no end that even when I thought we had a perfect vocal take, Elvis would want to do another — and then another. Each one would be better. He was digging deep and coming up with great new ammunition.

On our final day at Radio Recorders, when we had all gotten friendly and were listening to the playbacks, Elvis was slapping us on the back and telling us we were the baddest cats in town. A couple of the guys from MGM dropped by and listened as well. Elvis was singing our praises when one of the men — he might have been the casting director — looked at me and said, "He looks like a piano player."

"He's not," said Elvis. "That's Leiber. Leiber writes the lyrics."

"Well, he still looks like a piano player," the casting director repeated.

"The piano player's over there," said Elvis, pointing to Mike. "He writes the music."

"How 'bout if we get Leiber to play the part of the piano player in the movie?" asked the casting director. "All he has to do is run his fingers over the keys. Any fool can do that."

"Thank you," I said, "for the vote of confidence. But Mike 's the piano player."

"No, you go ahead, Jerry," said Mike in his customarily generous manner. "This is your big break. I don't want to deny you your screen debut."

So it was set: Jailhouse Rock, starring Elvis Presley and introducing Jerry Leiber.

Stoller On the morning that filming was to begin, Jerry called me.

"I got a problem. I can't make it," he said.

"Well, dying is definitely a problem. What's wrong, Jer?"

"A toothache from hell. You gotta replace me."

"But they want you," I reminded him.

"They'll never know the difference."

When I got to MGM Studios, they told me to shave off my goatee.

"It's a scene stealer," they said.

I showed up on the soundstage, went to wardrobe, where they put me in a Hawaiian shirt. I ended up in all the scenes where Elvis sang with the band. I never uttered a word. I wasn't allowed to. Because I wasn't in the Screen Actors Guild, I couldn't talk on screen.

Naturally, Elvis was the focus of attention. You couldn't help but notice his naturalness and ease as an actor. Yet, on at least one occasion, I noticed something else: his underlying insecurity.

It happened when Elvis walked through an area where the extras and bit-part players were sitting around. As he passed by, someone told a joke and everyone began to laugh. Elvis wheeled around and angrily said, "I bet you think you're really hot."

He had thought they were laughing at him. They weren't. I know; I was there. Elvis walked away, mumbling.

One day he approached me as we were leaving the set.

"Mike," he said, "I want you to write me a real pretty ballad."

"I'll get right on it."

That was on a Friday.

Saturday morning, Jerry and I got together and wrote "Don't." On Sunday, we got Young Jessie of the Flairs to sing the demo in an Elvis-like mode. (Jessie had recently substituted for Leon Hughes on the Coasters' recordings of "Searchin'" and "Young Blood.")

I brought "Don't" to Elvis on the set that Monday. He liked it, recorded it, and by January of the following year — 1958 — it hit #1, only three months after "Jailhouse Rock" had also gone to the top. You'd think we'd be heroes. But in the court of the King, it didn't work that way.

"What is your partner doing giving a song to Elvis Presley?" he asks. Freddy sounds enraged.

"Has Elvis decided to stop singing?" I ask.

"No, that's not the point." Now Freddy's yelling.

"Freddy," I say, "what's the problem, man? Did Elvis hate the song?"

"No, the problem is that he likes it."

"It is when we don't have a contract. Nothing's written down. You just don't hand a song to Elvis without a contract. In fact, you don't hand a song to Elvis at all. You hand a song to me or to Jean Aberbach. Then we get the business straight first."

"Well, when Mike and I wrote the song, we presumed the business would be the same as all business with Elvis. The Colonel is going to demand that Elvis and the Aberbachs own the publishing rights, right?"

"And we'll give them the publishing rights, just like before. So again I ask the question: what's the problem?"

"It's a question of procedure. The Colonel hates it when anyone goes behind his back."

"Mike didn't go behind his back. Mike 's a straight shooter. Mike 's the original straight shooter. Elvis asked him to write a ballad for him and we did. Beginning and end of story."

"You still don't get it."

"Maybe I don't want to get it, Freddy. But it really doesn't matter because Elvis has the ballad he asked for. And he'll have another hit. And all's well that ends well."

"If only it were that easy."

"It is, man," I say. "Believe me, it is."

Stoller Another critical Colonel moment came during the shooting of Jailhouse Rock.

After a long day on the soundstage, Elvis invited me back to the Beverly Wilshire, where he was staying. He'd had a pool table set up in his suite.

This was after he'd recorded our four songs for the soundtrack and after I'd given him "Don't." At this point Elvis was a big Leiber and Stoller fan and was telling everyone we were his "good luck charms."

"Whenever I record," he said, "I want you guys in the studio. You're the guys who make the magic."

Elvis's companions, the Memphis Mafia, were all there. They were drinking Cokes and waiting for their turn at the pool table. On the radio, the DJ was playing "Ruby Baby," a song we'd written for the Drifters. Elvis was actually singing along with the record:

I've got a gal and Ruby is her name

Ruby Ruby Ruby Baby

She don't love me, but I love her just the same

Ruby Ruby Ruby Baby

Ruby Ruby how I want ya

Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt ya

Ruby Ruby, when will you be mine

"Hey, Mike," said Elvis, "how do you guys write all these great songs?"

"Well, Elvis," I said, "we just kinda sit down and jam."

"It's amazing to me. I guess I just ain't much of a writer."

"You don't have to write songs. You're Elvis."

With that, Elvis gave me one of those gosh-darn expressions. At that point in his career, he was still humble.

As our game went on, I was taking careful aim at the nine ball, trying to sink it and not scratch. I looked up for a second and suddenly there was no one in the room but me. Where the hell had everyone gone?

A couple of minutes went by. When Elvis returned, his head was down and his demeanor totally changed.

"I'm really sorry, Mike," he said, "but you're gonna have to leave. The Colonel came in and he doesn't want anyone here but me and the guys."

"Okay," I said, not wanting to make any more trouble. And with that, I left. The next day at the shoot I mentioned the incident to one of Elvis's Memphis buddies.

"Don't take it personally, Mike," he said. "It's just that the Colonel doesn't want Elvis to develop a friendship with anyone but us."

Leiber A couple of months after Jailhouse Rock wrapped, Mike and I were still living in LA when we got a frantic call from Freddy Bienstock.

"Elvis is cutting a Christmas album," he said, "and they're a song short. He wants you guys to write something for him."

Next thing I know, Mike and I are driving over to Radio Recorders on Santa Monica Boulevard. When we walk in, Elvis is all smiles.

"My good luck charms are back!" He 's beaming.

"You got the song?" the Colonel wants to know.

"We just got the call," I say.

"Write me something good," says Elvis.

"Write it right now," says the Colonel.

Mike and I go into a mixing room where there 's an upright piano in the corner.

"You know what, Mike," I say. "Let's not screw around with anything overly inventive. Let's write this guy a straight-up, no-nonsense twelve-bar blues with a Christmas lyric. What do you say?"

"Okay by me."

Hang up your pretty stockings

And turn off the light

'Cause Santa Claus is coming down your chimney tonight

It takes us about fifteen minutes. When we come back into the studio, I say, "Okay, we got it."

"What took you so long?" the Colonel asks.

The Colonel doesn't laugh and the Colonel doesn't smile when we run down the song for Elvis. I know the Colonel thinks it's too bluesy and too black, but just before he can say anything, the King speaks out.

"Now that's what I call a goddamn great Christmas song!" he tells the Colonel. "I told you these guys would come through."

And with that, Elvis proceeds to sing the [expletive] out of it.

He does it in just a couple of takes. When he's through, he puts his arms around me and Mike and says, "Whenever I record, you guys are gonna be with me."

For me, "Santa Claus Is Back in Town" lives on as one of Elvis's great blues performances. It took him back to his Beale Street roots, a place where he was always comfortable.

Stoller Given Elvis's enthusiasm for our work, I wasn't surprised that we got a call from Jean Aberbach inviting us to his LA office, which was housed in a big home on Hollywood Boulevard.

"The Colonel wants to manage you," he said.

"We 're unmanageable," Jerry was quick to retort. "Everyone knows that."

"I wasn't joking," said Jerry. "We don't need management."

"Is that how you feel, Mike?" asked Aberbach.

"The Colonel feels he can do great things for your career," said Aberbach, "and he'd like you to sign these contracts." He handed us blank pieces of paper with only a signature line.

"Are you kidding?" we asked.

"No," Jean answered. "The Colonel said we can fill it in later, but basically it's a matter of mutual trust."



The Colonel got over our rejection of his offer. We knew that because we got a call late in 1957 that Elvis wanted more Leiber and Stoller songs. By then Jerry and I had made a permanent move to New York — more on that shortly — and went back to the Coast for a series of meetings.

The first was with Ben Hecht, the great Hollywood screenwriter, who had written, among many important works, Notorious for Alfred Hitchcock and The Front Page. Hecht had been in touch with us about an idea of Jerry's, a musical based on Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Despite the week we spent with him at his beach home in Oceanside, California, the project never materialized. Welcome to Hollywood.

The second reason we had returned to LA was Elvis. He wanted us to write songs for his new movie, King Creole. It was based on Harold Robbins's novel A Stone for Danny Fisher, and the screenplay suggested some real substance. We submitted four songs — "King Creole," "Trouble," "Steadfast, Loyal and True," and "Dirty Dirty Feeling." Elvis liked all four. ("Dirty Dirty Feeling" was dropped from the score, but two years later, when Elvis got out of the army, he remembered the tune and recorded it.) We worked in the studio with Elvis and, just like the Jailhouse Rock sessions, the rapport was good and the atmosphere relaxed. The Colonel may have been resentful that we turned down his offer for management, but when Elvis was happy — and whenever we were around, he seemed happy — the Colonel wasn't about to complain.
444 2009-06-14 VISITORS to the exhibition “From a Factory Floor: Screen Print Collaborations by Master Printmaker Gary Lichtenstein,” the inaugural show at the new Lift Trucks Project, might be hard-pressed to imagine the place filled with 8,000-pound forklifts. Comprising three artists’ studios and a large exhibition space, the Lift Trucks Project occupies the site of the former B. Hawley Smith Company, a forklift service and sales business.

The 5,600-square-foot factory, built in the 1920s, caught the eye of Tom Christopher, an artist who lives in South Salem. Mr. Christopher, whose paintings of New York City have been exhibited internationally, bought the property in 2008, and after a year of renovations moved his studio into the second floor.

“I found myself surrounded by all this room, and realized what a great project space it was,” Mr. Christopher said. “I thought, ‘I want to get some artists in here.’ And now we’ve launched our first show.”

“From a Factory Floor” chronicles important collaborations throughout the career of Gary Lichtenstein, a silk-screen artist and the owner of Gary Lichtenstein Fine Art in Ridgefield, Conn. The exhibition presents work by 14 artists — from painters like Alex Katz, Gary Panter and Karl Benjamin to Jack Micheline, a Beat generation poet, and Michael De Feo, a contemporary street artist — all printed by Mr. Lichtenstein.

Mr. Christopher described Mr. Lichtenstein as “one of the few great printers in the world.”

“He’s a master colorist who is able to bring out things in your work that you might not see yourself,” Mr. Christopher said.
445 2009-06-14 LAST summer Gennaro J. Sbarro, president of the company that owns Rothmann’s Steakhouse in East Norwich, and Joseph DeLorenzo, the owner of Abeetza Pizza and Caterers in Greenvale, were getting ready to open an upscale Italian restaurant in Mineola. Then the economy tanked, and they changed direction. In October the two opened Circa, a moderately priced spot where nothing on the regular menu costs more than $20.

The restaurant has the high-end good looks of the place the owners originally planned. (Mr. Sbarro was once a partner in the company that owned the Sbarro chain, but you’d never guess it from the décor at Circa.) At center stage is a round glass-topped table holding an elaborate (though artificial) flower arrangement, with a skylight above it that allows splashes of sunlight early in the evening. Another attention-getter is a stone fireplace (filled with candles this time of year). Banquettes circle the room, and bare wood tables in the center are teamed with beige leather chairs. On warm evenings, doors are thrown open to outdoor seating.

The wine list also seems to belong in a more expensive restaurant. Under ordinary circumstances, a bottle of wine should not cost double the price of an entree. On a list of 100 bottles here, only 15 are under $35.

The service is a bit shaky. Runners didn’t know who ordered which dish, and one night we had to ask for water refills. At a midweek meal, our waiter recited specials without giving prices. On the weekend we received a printed list of specials with prices (substantially higher than dishes on the menu, ranging from $26 to $34).

The look of the restaurant is cool and sophisticated. The atmosphere is warmed by Mario Mingione, the managing partner, who wanders the dining room, stopping to greet patrons. On our first visit we noticed diners at another table attacking what looked like a basket of chips. When we asked what they were eating with such gusto, Mr. Mingione rushed to the bar, grabbed a basket of delectable housemade potato chips and delivered them to us. (They are usually a bar snack.) On a return visit he welcomed us like long-lost relatives.
446 2009-06-14 Nearly everything about Kate Walbert’s new novel is wickedly smart, starting with the title: “A Short History of Women.” Does it connote modesty or grandeur? “Short” sounds modest. “History” sounds grand — grandiose, in fact, when affixed to a work of fiction. But “Women” clinches it: modest, then. After all, what more trifling subject could one elect to research? Such, at any rate, is the prevailing view in the world inhabited by Walbert’s characters — all five generations of them. One of the book’s accomplishments is that it persuades us that this sentiment holds no less currency in 21st-­century America than it did in late Victorian England. But Walbert’s primary concerns — unlike those of some of her characters — aren’t political. Her writing wears both its intelligence and its ideology lightly. No manifesto, this is a gorgeously wrought and ultimately wrenching work of art.

Like her last novel, “Our Kind,” which was a National Book Award finalist, “A Short History of Women” consists of linked stories: in this case, 15 lean, concentrated chapters that hopscotch through time and alternate among the lives of Dorothy Trevor Townsend, a British suffragist, and a handful of her descendants. Several of the stories have been previously published; most could stand alone. Yet together they coalesce into more than the sum of their parts. It is Walbert’s conceit that while the oldest and youngest generations never meet, they share a legacy of echoes: objects and phrases that repeat mysteriously, and with increasing significance, across the decades. This spare novel manages, improbably, to live up to its title: it delivers what feels like a reasonably representative history of women — at least of white, Anglo-Saxon women, over the past hundred-odd years.

What is that history? What are its implications? And why should we care about them? Consider Virginia Woolf’s dictum: “This is an important book, the critic assumes, because it deals with war. This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing room.” If you think this belief is dated, think again. Just two months ago, Joyce Carol Oates told The New York Times Magazine why violence is so often the subject of her fiction. “If you’re going to spend the next year of your life writing,” she explained, “you would probably rather write ‘Moby-Dick’ than a little household mystery.”

“A Short History of Women” ingeniously suggests the fallacy of the war/drawing room dichotomy. Its various settings include neither battlefield nor whaler, yet masculine power and influence pervade these pages, from Havelock Ellis, Charles Darwin and the “good men of Lloyd’s” in belle époque London to the young soldiers patrolling Dover Air Force Base in present-­day Delaware. What’s remarkable is the way Walbert uses male preoccupations to illuminate the lives of her female characters — and there’s nothing “little” about them.

The most arresting and oddly affecting is Evelyn Townsend, Dorothy’s daughter, who opens the book by announcing, “Mum starved herself for suffrage, Grandmother claiming it was just like Mum to take a cause too far.” The year is 1914, and the War to End All Wars has recently begun. Evelyn’s father long ago “vanished in Ceylon.” Her mother lies dead “in her simple box, a lavender Votes for Women sash across her small, unquivering bosom,” while “bloated zeppelins” darken the sky overhead. Eve­lyn, age 13, is packed off to a girls’ school far north of London, “out of harm’s way,” where she’ll be taught elocution and Domestic Duties.
447 2009-06-14 But there’s another car in this price class that is aimed at the quietly wealthy, the kind of people who can spend a lot on a toy but don’t much care if every valet at Chez Pretentious can rattle off the sticker price. The Mercedes SL63 AMG, oddly enough, is a 518-horsepower retractable-roof two-seater for people who don’t need to show off.

The SL got a facelift for 2009 — most noticeable are the sinister new headlights — but still uses the basic platform that made its debut for the 2003 model year. Which means that the $138,000 2009 SL63 AMG looks much like a 2003 SL55 AMG that now sells in the $30,000 range. As your neighbors wouldn’t discern a $100,000 difference between the two, it’s logical to conclude that the SL63 is for people who actually don’t want to flaunt the price of their car.

In the transition from SL55 to SL63, Mercedes steered the car onto a sportier path. The SL63 feels lithe and more energetic, mostly a result of installing a high-revving naturally aspirated motor to replace the SL55’s supercharged sledgehammer.

The SL63’s new 518-horsepower V-8 is hand-built and flings the car to 60 miles an hour in 4.4 seconds, all the while making noises like a Chevy LS7 with its exhaust pipes plunged in a vat of Krug. Even so, it’s not the quickest SL: that honor goes to the 650-horsepower SL65 AMG Black Series by half a second.

The SL63’s transmission incorporates new wrinkles that further muddle the already murky distinctions among manual transmissions, sequential manuals and automatics. Basically, this 7-speed gearbox — the AMG Speedshift MCT in Benzspeak — is an automatic that dispenses with the usual torque converter, instead using a wet clutch to link the engine to the drivetrain. Because a clutch can disconnect the engine entirely from the transmission, the SL63 is capable of a trick once unique to manual transmissions: the high-r.p.m. clutch drop.

To execute this move, the driver must select the manual sport mode of the transmission and initiate what Mercedes calls the Race Start feature, a procedure that’s so complicated it should require two keys and an executive order from the president. If you’ve done it right, the engine revs to around 4,000 r.p.m. with the clutch disengaged. Pop your left foot off the brake, hold the gas to the floor and the clutch engages for a maximum-velocity takeoff.

When it’s time to upshift, the gear change is completed in only 100 milliseconds in the fastest shift mode, which equals the speed of the F1 Superfast sequential manual in the Ferrari 599 GTB. So, the motor is a titan of horsepower, the transmission does a fair impression of a Ferrari and the 19-inch split-spoke wheels look so familiar that the Porsche 911 Turbo is probably on the phone with its lawyer. The SL63 AMG is a hard-edged sports car, then?

No, not really. At 4,274 pounds, the SL63 is about 200 pounds heavier than the GLK350 4Matic crossover wagon. And its Active Body Control suspension provides a supple ride, but there’s something disconnected about the feel it imparts during hard driving — those heated, 12-way adjustable leather seats are loath to afflict the driver’s posterior with rude news from the road below.

To be sure, this is a machine that will acquit itself well at a track day, but it’s clearly biased toward the reality of its everyday mission, which is to cosset the lucky lady or gent behind the wheel. I’ve seen one SL63 AMG in the wild, and it wasn’t at a track, but parked at one of those Napa Valley resorts that looks rustic and unpretentious, but has 1,000-thread count toilet paper and butlers for the butlers. The SL63 looked right at home in that tableau, a six-figure flag-bearer for inconspicuous consumption.
448 2009-06-14 Leoben has received quite a lot of attention. In America, its public profile has been limited to a series of get-a-load-of-this e-mail messages and mocking blog posts (where the prison is often misidentified as a corrections center outside Chicago), but in Europe, Hohensinn’s design has become more of a model — not universally accepted, but not easily ignored either. It is the opening statement in a debate about what it means to construct a better prison. Already there are plans to build something like it outside of Berlin.

The day Hohensinn and I visited, Leoben was dreary, and there were traces of sleet in the air; as we approached, the building looked both idle and inviting, like a college library during winter break — or it would have, anyway, were it not for the razor wire coiled along the concrete wall of the yard and the sentence carved below it, a line from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which the United States signed and ratified) that reads: “All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.”

Inside the prison it felt like Sunday afternoon, though in fact it was a Tuesday. There was a glassy brightness over everything, and most surprising, an unbreakable silence. Prisons are usually clamorous places, filled with the sound of metal doors opening and closing, and the general racket that comes with holding large numbers of men in a confined space. Noise is part of the chaos of prison life; Leoben was serene. I mentioned as much to Hohensinn, and he smiled and pointed to the whitewashed ceilings. He had taken great care to install soundproofing.

An assistant warden accompanied us on our tour, one of three guards on duty tasked with watching more than 200 inmates. On one side of the prison there was a block of prisoners on remand; on the other side were the convicts, living in units called pods — groups of 15 one-person cells with floor-to-ceiling windows, private lavatories and a common space that includes a small kitchen. We came upon one prisoner cooking a late lunch for a few of his podmates; we stood there for a bit, chatting. They were wearing their own clothes. The utensils on the table were metal. “They are criminals,” Hohensinn said to me, “but they are also human beings. The more normal a life you give them here, the less necessary it is to resocialize them when they leave.” His principle, he said, was simple: “Maximum security outside; maximum freedom inside.” (The bars over the balconies are there to ensure the inmates’ safety, Hohensinn said; the surrounding wall outside is more than enough to make sure no one gets free.)

We walked around some more. There was a gymnasium, a prayer room, a room for conjugal visits. I asked Hohensinn what he would do if, contrary to fact, it were conclusively proved that prisons like his encouraged crime rather than diminished it. Would he renounce the design? He shook his head. “The prisoners’ dignity is all I really care about,” he told me.

Suppose we can’t bring ourselves to be quite so magnanimous. Suppose all we’re interested in is reducing crime. If you trust a criminal with a better environment, will he prove trustworthy? As far as Leoben is concerned, it’s too soon to tell. The place has been open for only four years. But I noticed something as we were leaving, and in the absence of any other data it seemed significant. In the three or four hours we spent roaming all through the place, I hadn’t seen a single example of vandalism.

It sounds odd to say, but it’s nonetheless true: we punish people with architecture. The building is the method. We put criminals in a locked room, inside a locked structure, and we leave them there for a specified period of time.

It wasn’t always so. Prison is an invention, and a fairly recent one at that: it wasn’t until the 18th century that incarceration became our primary form of punishment. True, there have been dungeons and the like for quite some time, but they were generally for traitors and political enemies and, later, debtors. More common criminals could expect other forms of penalty: execution, for example, and various kinds of corporal punishment; forced labor and conscription; public humiliation; the levying of fines; exile; loss of privileges and offices; and so on. We’ve come to consider most of these barbaric, unjust or wildly impractical, but their very existence should tend against the idea that settling with criminals by putting them in a building is a natural thing to do.

To be sure, there’s something about prisons that engages man’s imagination. Alberti discussed them, Piranesi drew them, Jeremy Bentham proposed them. But the imagination of incarceration rarely translates directly into design. Bentham’s Panopticon, a circular structure with an all-seeing guardhouse in the middle, was meant to show that surveillance was as powerful a method of control as shackles and door locks — an idea that has proved enticing to many an academic, though it was never built.

In fact, for a long time many prisons, including some of the most well known — the Tower of London, for example — were repurposed castles, fortresses and gates; and even in the U.S., where such legacy buildings didn’t exist, prison construction was an ad hoc affair. Among the first people to try to blend ideology, morality and design principles into a carefully planned building were the Quakers of Pennsylvania, whose late-18th-century model was characteristically spare, consisting primarily of cells where convicts were to be kept in strict isolation, that they might better explore their own souls and find a way to God. A competing system, known as the Auburn model, arose a few years later. It focused more on the potential rehabilitative powers of labor, so it included larger spaces where prisoners could work together; but it, too, called for them to spend the rest of their time alone.

And there, for the most part, the thinking simply stops. Surveillance techniques come and go, materials change, levels of security are introduced and refined. The language changes, from “penitence” to “incarceration” to “corrections,” but very little is fundamentally different than it was. You can get it in a rectangle or a circle, in a radiant or a telephone-pole style, in brick or concrete or shipping containers; you can get guardhouses conducting surveillance via closed-circuit TV, electronic doors, an isolation room. But it’s pretty much the same building: a large institution, holding many convicts in small cells for years at a time.

Does imprisonment work? It seems like a bottom-line question, but the answer depends on what you want prisons to do, and that’s not an easy thing to decide. Even if we assume that there are good and sensible reasons to incarcerate people, there remains some debate about what purpose is served. Deterrence is often proposed as a goal, but no one really knows whether the prospect of incarceration gives would-be criminals pause, and in any case we quickly reach the realm of diminishing returns. “It’s absurd to think that the worse you make these places, the less recidivism you’ll have,” said Michael Jacobson, who was commissioner of the New York City Department of Corrections under Mayor Rudy Giuliani and is now the director of the Vera Institute of Justice, a research group that focuses on criminal justice. “For one thing, it’s hard to make a lot of these places worse. Besides, people commit crimes after serving sentences in the third ring of hell. You’re not going to stop them by demoting them to the fourth ring.” Moreover, most crimes are committed either in the heat of the moment or by career criminals who consider themselves invincible. Few people in either group think about where they might wind up. When I asked one of the prisoners at Leoben if he was surprised by how nice it was, he said no; what surprised him was that he’d been caught in the first place.

In fact, though most of us are reluctant to admit it, we mainly use prisons as storage containers, putting people there with the hope that, if nothing else, five years behind bars means five years during which they can’t commit more crimes. It’s called warehousing, and we do a lot of it. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, by far — it is more than five times as high as in the U.K. About 1 in every 100 American adults is in federal or state prisons or local jails — 1 in 30 men between 20 and 34, 1 in 9 black men of the same age. All told, we keep about 2.3 million adults behind bars: if the entire prison population were treated as a single city, it would be the fourth-largest in the United States, just behind Chicago and just ahead of Houston. Moreover, our incarceration rate has climbed, or rather rocketed, for the past 30 years: adjusted for population growth, there are about four times as many people in prison this year as there were in 1980. In response, we’ve hastily thrown up hundreds of prisons. But not nearly enough: facilities are strained, units are grotesquely overcrowded and space for medical and psychological services has become profoundly inadequate. We pay lip-service to the idea of rehabilitation, but we do little to make it happen. About 67 percent of the prisoners who are released are arrested again within three years. The result, to borrow a phrase from a Conservative British home secretary, has been “an expensive way of making bad people worse.”

To be fair, prominent architects aren’t lining up to take on the task of making prisons better. Most of Hohensinn’s colleagues would be happy to design a courthouse, but few are quite as eager to build a penitentiary, though the two are merely opposite ends of a single system. New prison construction is generally parceled out to a handful of large and more-or-less anonymous firms — a process that discourages innovation. Whoever gets the commission is told how many beds are needed, what kinds of security, how much room for the clinic, the recreation area, the guardhouses. They’re big-box prisons, as anonymous and uninflected as so many Wal-Marts.

Jeff Goodale, the director of correctional design at HDR, a large architectural firm based in Omaha, was disarmingly frank about what he faced. “When I got into the business in the ’70s,” he told me, “there was a very progressive approach to prison design. There was an emphasis on creating an environment that would lend itself to rehabilitation — low-rise buildings, more human scale. In the ’80s and ’90s, the trend became very much about throwing people in jail, locking them up, taking amenities away from them. We spent a fortune on security, and it did little for recidivism.” He went on to describe what he’d like to see happen instead, and it was much like Leoben. “That works great,” he said. “It doesn’t cost significantly more to build, and you save on maintenance, vandalism, lawsuits, assaults, medical care.” But, he added sharply, “at the end of the day, my clients are my clients. We’ve been told we can’t make it look too good, because the public won’t accept it.”

Perhaps that’s because most people never see prisons. The facilities at Leoben are part of a complex designed by the same architect, which houses both courtrooms and a variety of more mundane offices — the local property registrar and the like. You commit a crime, you go to jail, you go to court and, if you’re convicted, you go to prison, and the fact that all three are contiguous is meant to remind you, and everyone around you, that the process relies on a set of institutions that flow from one to the next.

By contrast, new American prisons are usually built out in the countryside, where land and labor are cheaper, and security is easier to establish. And since site selection is the first step in design, everything stems from that. A rural prison needs no public face. It needn’t articulate any sense of civic pride or communal justice, because there’s no one around to see it, beyond the prisoners themselves, the guards and the occasional visitor.

There are other social costs. As Jonathan Simon, a law professor at Berkeley, pointed out to me, convicts tend to come from cities; guards do not. Culture clashes inevitably arise. Skilled labor — doctors, psychologists and the like — is harder to find in rural areas, and so are the volunteers who work in the many rehabilitation programs. The families of working-class and poor convicts often can’t afford to travel a few hundred miles to visit their relatives. As a result, prisoners have a harder time maintaining ties with the lives they left behind.

And it isn’t only inmates and their loved ones who suffer. Almost everyone I spoke to was quick to point out that guards and inmates are essentially imprisoned together. As Michael Jacobson, the head of the Vera Institute, put it, “Officers serve life sentences eight hours at a time.” To a surprising degree, then, both groups want the same thing: They want prisons to be safer and more humane, and they believe that can best be achieved by building in more face time between convicts and their keepers. They want smaller, less anonymous units. They want more natural light. The debate over prison design shouldn’t begin and end with our asking what it’s like to live in one. We should also be asking what it’s like to work in one.

Let’s admit at once that the Leoben facility isn’t the Jesus Prison: It’s not going to single-handedly heal us and carry us up to Paradise. Even if you endorse its goals, it may not be the best implementation of them. Its windows might create an unnerving lack of privacy in a dense city. Allowances would have to be made for the breadth of our landscapes and the nature of our crimes — a prison in California, with California’s gang presence, would most likely be built differently from a prison in Vermont. What’s more, no institutional architecture can be expected to consistently manifest the clarity and elegance of Hohensinn’s design.

More to the point, it’s unlikely that anything even remotely like it will be built in this country anytime soon. John Baldwin, the director of the Iowa Department of Corrections, looked at pictures of the Leoben design and, like many people, found it both intriguing and a bit much. “We’re more focused on putting our money into mental-health and re-entry treatment units,” he told me. “I didn’t see a great deal of treatment space, or the kind of classroom space where you can teach job skills. Nice views, great basketball court, but I didn’t think Iowans want to put their money into that sort of thing.

“Still,” he said with atypical enthusiasm, “architecture is huge.” Iowa is in the process of building new facilities for both men and women. To that end, the state held a design competition and received 17 entries. While the winning submissions are not as luxurious as the Leoben prison, they do share certain principles: a smaller number of cells in each unit, more sunlight, security made deliberately unobtrusive. Other states may soon be joining Iowa, if not because they want to then because they have to. Earlier this year, federal judges in California tentatively ruled that the state release almost a third of its prisoners because the conditions in which they’re kept amount to cruel and unusual punishment. If the ruling holds up on appeal, it’s quite likely that other states will face similar sanctions. And then what?
449 2009-06-14 Small wonder that this vast, dispersed network of interdependent data systems has lately come to be referred to by an appropriately atmospheric — and vaporous — metaphor: the cloud. Trying to chart the cloud’s geography can be daunting, a task that is further complicated by security concerns. “It’s like ‘Fight Club,’ ” says Rich Miller, whose Web site, Data Center Knowledge, tracks the industry. “The first rule of data centers is: Don’t talk about data centers.”

Yet as data centers increasingly become the nerve centers of business and society — even the storehouses of our fleeting cultural memory (that dancing cockatoo on YouTube!) — the demand for bigger and better ones increases: there is a growing need to produce the most computing power per square foot at the lowest possible cost in energy and resources. All of which is bringing a new level of attention, and challenges, to a once rather hidden phenomenon. Call it the architecture of search: the tens of thousands of square feet of machinery, humming away 24/7, 365 days a year — often built on, say, a former bean field — that lie behind your Internet queries.

Microsoft’s data center in Tukwila, Wash., sits amid a nondescript sprawl of beige boxlike buildings. As I pulled up to it in a Prius with Michael Manos, who was then Microsoft’s general manager of data-center services, he observed that while “most people wouldn’t be able to tell this wasn’t just a giant warehouse,” an experienced eye could discern revelatory details. “You would notice the plethora of cameras,” he said. “You could follow the power lines.” He gestured to a series of fluted silver pipes along one wall. “Those are chimney stacks, which probably tells you there’s generators behind each of those stacks.” The generators, like the huge banks of U.P.S. (uninterruptible power supply) batteries, ward against surges and power failures to ensure that the data center always runs smoothly.

After submitting to biometric hand scans in the lobby and passing through a sensor-laden multidoor man trap, Manos and I entered a bright, white room filled with librarylike rows of hulking, black racks of servers — the dedicated hardware that drives the Internet. The Tukwila data center happens to be one of the global homes of Microsoft’s Xbox Live: within those humming machines exists my imagined city of ether. Like most data centers, Tukwila comprises a sprawling array of servers, load balancers, routers, fire walls, tape-backup libraries and database machines, all resting on a raised floor of removable white tiles, beneath which run neatly arrayed bundles of power cabling. To help keep servers cool, Tukwila, like most data centers, has a system of what are known as hot and cold aisles: cold air that seeps from perforated tiles in front is sucked through the servers by fans, expelled into the space between the backs of the racks and then ventilated from above. The collective din suggests what it must be like to stick your head in a Dyson Airblade hand dryer.

Tukwila is less a building than a machine for computing. “You look at a typical building,” Manos explained, “and the mechanical and electrical infrastructure is probably below 10 percent of the upfront costs. Whereas here it’s 82 percent of the costs.” Little thought is given to exterior appearances; even the word “architecture” in the context of a data center can be confusing: it could refer to the building, the network or the software running on the servers. Chris Crosby, a senior vice president with Digital Realty Trust, the country’s largest provider of data-center space, compares his company’s product to a car, an assembly-line creation complete with model numbers: “The model number tells you how much power is available inside the facility.” He also talks about the “industrialization of the data center,” in contrast to the so-called whiteboard model of server design, by which each new building might be drawn up from scratch. The data center, he says, is “our railroad; it doesn’t matter what kind of train you put on it.”

At Tukwila — as at any big data center — the computing machinery is supported by what Manos calls the “back-of-the-house stuff”: the chiller towers, the miles of battery springs, the intricate networks of piping. There’s also what Manos calls “the big iron,” the 2.5-megawatt, diesel-powered Caterpillar generators clustered at one end of a cavernous space known as the wind tunnel, through which air rushes to cool the generators. “In reality, the cloud is giant buildings full of computers and diesel generators,” Manos says. “There’s not really anything white or fluffy about it.”

Tukwila is one of Microsoft’s smaller data centers (they number “more than 10 and fewer than 100,” Manos told me with deliberate vagueness). In 2006, the company, lured by cheap hydropower, tax incentives and a good fiber-optic network, built a 500,000-plus-square-foot data center in Quincy, Wash., a small town three hours from Tukwila known for its bean and spearmint fields. This summer, Microsoft will open a 700,000-plus-square-foot data center — one of the world’s largest — in Chicago. “We are about three to four times larger than when I joined the company” — in 2004 — “just in terms of data-center footprint,” Debra Chrapaty, corporate vice president of Global Foundation Services at Microsoft, told me when I met with her at Microsoft’s offices in Redmond, Wash.

Yet when it comes to a large company like Microsoft, it can be difficult to find out what any given data center is used for. The company, for reasons ranging from security to competitive advantage, won’t provide too much in the way of details, apart from noting that Quincy could hold 6.75 trillion photos. “We support over 200 online properties with very large scale,” Chrapaty offered. “And so when you think about Hotmail supporting 375 million users, or search supporting three billion queries a month, or Messenger supporting hundreds of millions of users, you can easily assume that those properties are very large properties for our company.”

Thanks to the efforts of amateur Internet Kremlinologists, there are occasional glimpses behind the silicon curtain. One blogger managed to copy a frame from a 2008 video of a Microsoft executive’s PowerPoint presentation showing that the company had nearly 150,000 servers (a number that presumably would now be much higher, given an estimated monthly server growth of 10,000) and that nearly 80,000 of those were used by its search application, now called Bing. When I discussed the figures with her, Chrapaty would only aver, crisply, that “in an average data center, it’s not uncommon for search to take up a big portion of a facility.”

THE RISE OF THE MEGA-DATA CENTER

Data centers were not always unmarked, unassuming and highly restricted places. In the 1960s, in fact, huge I.B.M. mainframe computers commanded pride of place in corporate headquarters. “It was called the glasshouse,” says Kenneth Brill, founder of the Uptime Institute, a data-center research and consulting group. “It was located near the executive suite. Here you’d spent $15 to 30 million on this thing — the executives wanted to show it off.”

Over the past few decades, Brill notes, there has been an oscillation between using centralized I.T. resources and using more dispersed computing power — a battle between mainframes and desktop computers. The latest iteration is what’s called the thin client: the use of centralized servers rather than the software and operating systems of desktops to perform the bulk of computing needs. But thinness in the office has come with increased thickness elsewhere: more servers in ever-larger data centers.

In his book “The Big Switch,” Nicholas Carr draws an analogy between the rise of mega-data centers and the Industrial Revolution. Just as nascent industries, once powered by water wheels, were by the 20th century able to “run their machines with electric current generated in distant power plants,” advances in technology and transmission speeds are permitting computing to function like a utility, a distant but ever-accessible cloud of services.

This has sweeping implications for business and society. Instead of buying software and hiring I.T. employees, companies can outsource things like customer relationship management, or C.R.M., the database software that companies use to track client interactions, to an Internet company like salesforce.com, which sells subscriptions, or seats, to its services. “Customers who have two seats on salesforce.com, like a mom-and-pop flower shop, have access to the same application as a customer that has 65,000 seats, like Starbucks or Dell,” Adam Gross, vice president of platform marketing with salesforce.com, told me at the company’s offices in San Francisco. By contrast, just a few years ago, he went on, “if you were to attack a really large problem, like delivering a C.R.M. application to 50,000 companies, or serving every single song ever, it really sort of felt outside your domain unless you were one of the largest companies in the world. There are these architectures now available for anybody to really attack these massive-scale kinds of problems.”

And while most companies still maintain their own data centers, the promise is that instead of making costly investments in redundant I.T. hardware, more and more companies will tap into the utility-computing grid, piggybacking on the infrastructures of others. Already, Amazon Web Services makes available, for a fee, the company’s enormous computing power to outside customers. The division already uses more bandwidth than Amazon’s extensive retailing operations, while its Simple Storage Service holds some 52 billion virtual objects. “We used to think that owning factories was an important piece of a business’s value,” says Bryan Doerr, the chief technology officer of Savvis, which provides I.T. infrastructure and what the company calls “virtualized utility services” for companies like Hallmark. “Then we realized that owning what the factory produces is more important.”

THE ANNIHILATION OF SPACE BY TIME

For companies like Google, Yahoo and, increasingly, Microsoft, the data center is the factory. What these companies produce are services. It was the increasing “viability of a service-based model,” as Ray Ozzie, now the chief software architect at Microsoft, put it in 2005 — portended primarily by Google and its own large-scale network of data centers — that set Microsoft on its huge data-center rollout: if people no longer needed desktop software, they would no longer need Microsoft. This realization brought new prominence to the humble infrastructure layer of the data center, an aspect of the business that at Microsoft, as at most tech companies, typically escaped notice — unless it wasn’t working. Data centers have now become, as Debra Chrapaty of Microsoft puts it, a “true differentiator.”

Indeed, the number of servers in the United States nearly quintupled from 1997 to 2007. (Kenneth Brill of the Uptime Institute notes that the mega-data centers of Google and its ilk account for only an estimated 5 percent of the total market.) The expansion of Internet-driven business models, along with the data retention and compliance requirements of a variety of tighter accounting standards and other financial regulations, has fueled a tremendous appetite for data-center space. For a striking example of how our everyday clicks and uploads help drive and shape this real world real estate, consider Facebook.

Facebook’s numbers are staggering. More than 200 million users have uploaded more than 15 billion photos, making Facebook the world’s largest photo-sharing service. This expansion has required a corresponding infrastructure push, with an energetic search for financing. “We literally spend all our time figuring how to keep up with the growth,” Jonathan Heiliger, Facebook’s vice president of technical operations, told me in a company conference room in Palo Alto, Calif. “We basically buy space and power.” Facebook, he says, is too large to rent space in a managed “co-location facility,” yet not large enough to build its own data centers. “Five years ago, Facebook was a couple of servers under Mark’s desk in his dorm room,” Heiliger explained, referring to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder. “Then it moved to two sorts of hosting facilities; then it graduated to this next category, taking a data center from an R.E.I.T.” — real estate investment trust — “in the Bay Area and then basically continued to expand that. We now have a fleet of data centers.”

A big challenge for Facebook, or any Internet site with millions of users, is “scalability” — ensuring that the infrastructure will keep working as new applications or users are added (often in incredibly spiky fashion, as when Oprah Winfrey joined and immediately garnered some 170,000 friends). Another issue is determining where Facebook’s data centers are located, where its users are located and the distance between them — what is called latency. Though the average user might not appreciate it, a visit to Facebook may involve dozens of round trips between a browser and any number of the site’s servers. In 2007, Facebook opened a third data center in Virginia to expand its capacity and serve its increasing number of users in Europe and elsewhere. “If you’re in the middle of the country, the differences are pretty minor whether you go to California or Virginia,” Heiliger said. But extend your communications to, say, India, and delay begins to compound. Bits, limited by the laws of physics, can travel no faster than the speed of light. To hurry things up, Facebook can try to reduce the number of round trips, or to “push the data as close to a user as possible” (by creating new data centers), or to rely on content-data networks that store commonly retrieved data in Internet points of presence (POPs) around the world.

While an anxious Facebook user serially refreshing to see if a friend has replied to an invitation might seem the very picture of the digital age’s hunger for instantaneity, to witness a true imperative for speed, you must visit NJ2, a data center located in Weehawken, N.J., just through the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan. There, in an unmarked beige complex with smoked windows, hum the trading engines of several large financial exchanges including, until recently, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (it was absorbed last year by Nasdaq).

NJ2, owned by Digital Realty Trust, is managed by Savvis, which provides “proximity hosting” — enabling financial companies to be close to the market. At first I took this to mean proximity to Wall Street, but I soon learned that it meant proximity of the financial firms’ machines to the machines of the trading exchanges in NJ2. This is desirable because of the rise of electronic exchanges, in which machine-powered models are, essentially, competing against other machine-powered models. And the temporal window for such trading, which is projected this year by Celent to account for some 46 percent of all U.S. trading volume, is growing increasingly small.

“It used to be that things were done in seconds, then milliseconds,” Varghese Thomas, Savvis’s vice president of financial markets, told me. Intervening steps — going through a consolidated ticker vendor like Thomson Reuters — added 150 to 500 milliseconds to the time it takes for information to be exchanged. “These firms said, ‘I can eliminate that latency much further by connecting to the exchanges directly,’ ” Thomas explained. Firms initially linked from their own centers, but that added precious fractions of milliseconds. So they moved into the data center itself. “If you’re in the facility, you’re eliminating that wire.” The specter of infinitesimal delay is why, when the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the nation’s oldest, upgraded its trading platform in 2006, it decided to locate the bulk of its trading engines 80 miles — and three milliseconds — from Philadelphia, and into NJ2, where, as Thomas notes, the time to communicate between servers is down to a millionth of a second. (Latency concerns are not limited to Wall Street; it is estimated that a 100-millisecond delay reduces Amazon’s sales by 1 percent.)

At NJ2, a room hosting one of the exchanges (I agreed not to say which, for security reasons), housed, in typical data-center fashion, rows of loudly humming black boxes, whose activity was literally inscrutable. This seemed strangely appropriate; after all, as Thomas pointed out, the data center hosts a number of “dark pools,” or trading regimens that allow the anonymous buying and selling of small amounts of securities at a time, so as not, as Thomas puts it, “to create ripples in the market.”

It seemed heretical to think of Karl Marx. But looking at the roomful of computers running automated trading models that themselves scan custom-formatted machine-readable financial news stories to help make decisions, you didn’t have to be a Marxist to appreciate his observation that industry will strive to “produce machines by means of machines” — as well as his prediction that the “more developed the capital,” the more it would seek the “annihilation of space by time.”

THE COST OF THE CLOUD

Data centers worldwide now consume more energy annually than Sweden. And the amount of energy required is growing, says Jonathan Koomey, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. From 2000 to 2005, the aggregate electricity use by data centers doubled. The cloud, he calculates, consumes 1 to 2 percent of the world’s electricity.

Much of this is due simply to growth in the number of servers and the Internet itself. A Google search is not without environmental consequence — 0.2 grams of CO2 per search, the company claims — but based on E.P.A. assumptions, an average car trip to the library consumes some 4,500 times the energy of a Google search while a page of newsprint uses some 350 times more energy. Data centers, however, are loaded with inefficiencies, including loss of power as it is distributed through the system. It has historically taken nearly as much wattage to cool the servers as it does to run them. Many servers are simply “comatose.” “Ten to 30 percent of servers are just sitting there doing nothing,” Koomey says. “Somebody in some department had a server doing this unique thing for a while and then stopped using it.” Because of the complexity of the network architecture — in which the role of any one server might not be clear or may have simply been forgotten — turning off a server can create more problems (e.g., service outages) than simply leaving it on.

As servers become more powerful, more kilowatts are needed to run and cool them; square footage in data centers is eaten up not by servers but by power. As data centers grow to unprecedented scales — Google recently reported that one of its data centers holds more than 45,000 servers (only a handful of companies have that many total servers) — attention has shifted to making servers less energy intensive. One approach is to improve the flow of air in the data center, through computational fluid-dynamics modeling. “Each of these servers could take input air at about 80 degrees,” John Sontag, director of the technology transfer office at Hewlett-Packard, told me as we walked through the company’s research lab in Palo Alto. “The reason why you run it at 57 is you’re not actually sure you can deliver cold air” everywhere it is needed. Chandrakant Patel, director of the Sustainable I.T. Ecosystem Lab at H.P., argues there has been “gross overprovisioning” of cooling in data centers. “Why should all the air-conditioners run full time in the data center?” he asks. “They should be turned down based on the need.”

Power looms larger than space in the data center’s future — the data-center group Afcom predicts that in the next five years, more than 90 percent of companies’ data centers will be interrupted at least once because of power constrictions. As James Hamilton of Amazon Web Services observed recently at a Google-hosted data-center-efficiency summit, there is no Moore’s Law for power — while servers become progressively more powerful (and cheaper to deploy) and software boosts server productivity, the cost of energy (as well as water, needed for cooling) stays constant or rises. Uptime’s Brill notes that while it once took 30 to 50 years for electricity costs to match the cost of the server itself, the electricity on a low-end server will now exceed the server cost itself in less than four years — which is why the geography of the cloud has migrated to lower-rate areas.

The huge power draws have spurred innovation in the form factor of the data center itself. For its Chicago center, Microsoft is outfitting half the building with shipping containers packed with servers. “Imagine a data center that’s about 30 megawatts, with standard industry average density numbers you can probably fit 25,000 to 30,000 servers in a facility like that,” says Microsoft’s Chrapaty. “You can do 10 times that in a container-based facility, because the containers offer power density numbers that are very hard to realize in a standard rack-mount environment.”

The containers — which are pre-equipped with racks of servers and thus are essentially what is known in the trade as plug-and-play — are shipped by truck direct from the original equipment manufacturer and attached to a central spine. “You can literally walk into that building on the first floor and you’d be hard pressed to tell that building apart from a truck-logistics depot,” says Manos, who has since left Microsoft to join Digital Realty Trust. “Once the containers get on site, we plug in power, water, network connectivity, and the boxes inside wake up, figure out which property group they belong to and start imaging themselves. There’s very little need for people.”

“Our perspective long term is: It’s not a building, it’s a piece of equipment,” says Daniel Costello, Microsoft’s director of data-center research, “and the enclosure is not there to protect human occupancy; it’s there to protect the equipment.”

From here, it is easy to imagine gradually doing away with the building itself, and its cooling requirements, which is, in part, what Microsoft is doing next, with its Gen 4 data center in Dublin. One section of the facility consists of a series of containers, essentially parked and stacked amid other modular equipment — with no roof or walls. It will use outside air for cooling. On our drive to Tukwila, Manos gestured to an electrical substation, a collection of transformers grouped behind a chain-link fence. “We’re at the beginning of the information utility,” he said. “The past is big monolithic buildings. The future looks more like a substation — the data center represents the information substation of tomorrow.”

465 2009-06-15 The campaign is the first from DeVito/Verdi since the Kobrand Corporation awarded the agency the Appleton Estate account in December, for tasks that include creative development, media planning and buying, events and nontraditional advertising.

Kobrand became the United States sales and marketing agent for the Appleton Estate rums in May 2008 after reaching an agreement with the brand’s owner, the J. Wray & Nephew Group of Jamaica. The Brown-Forman Corporation had handled Appleton Estate in this country from October 2001 through April 2008.

The campaign concentrates on Appleton Estate Reserve, which is 40 proof, and Appleton Estate 12-year-old, which is 43 proof. The former sells for $25 to $29 for a 750-ml. bottle; the latter is priced in the low $40s.

The campaign is trying to do for rum what has already been done for vodka and tequila: Expand drinkers’ perceptions of the quality of certain brands of distilled spirits to the point where they are willing to pay more for liquor in those categories than ever before.

DeVito/Verdi has some experience in that realm, having created campaigns for Grey Goose vodka when it was owned by the Sidney Frank Importing Company, which sold the premium-priced brand for more than $2 billion to Bacardi Ltd.

In one of those funny ways the ball sometimes bounces when it hits the pavement on Madison Avenue, by claiming that Appleton Estate is tasty enough to never see the inside of a blender DeVito/Verdi is differentiating the brand from the Bacardi Ltd. flagship, Bacardi rum, which has built its leadership in the category on ads that pair it with mixers like Coca-Cola, orange juice, tonic water and club soda.

“Bacardi is the 800-pound gorilla” in the rum market, acknowledges John Pennacchio, director for spirits at Kobrand in Purchase, N.Y., “and with the addition of flavors its share of the category has grown.” His reference is to new flavored Bacardi varieties like lemon, vanilla and apple.

“Rum is the second largest category after vodka,” Mr. Pennacchio says, and like vodka it is “an ingredient category,” in that it is known for being part of mixed drinks and cocktails.

If you go out for a drink and “you say, ‘rum and Coke,’ you’re not going to get yelled at,” he adds.

And then there are rum drinks like daiquiris, mojitos, piña coladas and Mai Tais, just as with vodka the cocktails include martinis and bloody Marys.

But at the same time there is a counter-trend, Mr. Pennacchio says, in that many consumers “are looking for more complex tastes in their foods, in what they drink,” compared with what he calls “the liquid candy” of sweet drinks.

“The sipping and the savoring” embodied by the “Sip up” theme become a call to action” to those drinkers, Mr. Pennacchio says, adding: “We’re not against mixability. We’re saying rum is on par with the classic spirits” like single-malt Scotch, small-batch bourbons and Cognac, which can be enjoyed without accompaniments.

“Taste tests give us very good confidence there’s something there,” Mr. Pennacchio says, referring to work done before the campaign was introduced.

And “the ad that gets the most reaction,” he adds, is one for the 12-year-old variety of Appleton Estate. “It spent 12 years in a barrel,” the headline says. “The last thing it wants to see is the inside of a blender.”

Other ads express that sentiment in similar fashion. “Sorry, Coke,” one headline reads.

Another ad urges rum drinkers to realize that “the aroma of butterscotch, orange peel and vanilla should enter your nose. Not a cocktail umbrella.”

Then there are ads that seek to establish the upscale credentials of Appleton Estate in a cheeky fashion typical of ads from DeVito/Verdi.

“Considered Jamaica’s finest legal export,” one headline declares slyly. The headline of another ad pokes at a competitive brand fronted by a pirate: “A rum well beyond the rank of captain.”

A tongue-in-cheek approach is important, says Brad Emmett, creative director at DeVito/Verdi, because to so many drinkers “rum is fun.”

“We didn’t want to take it to a stuffy place, to say, ‘There’s no more fun in rum now that it’s in the world of sipping like Cognac,’ ” Mr. Emmett says.

“You look at these ads and they bring a smile to your face,” he adds, particularly the ones in which the straws and swords “are knocking out anything that doesn’t need to be in the drink.”

To underline the message, “we kept the ads clean, we kept them simple,” Mr. Emmett says, featuring only a glass and a bottle posed on plain white backgrounds.

That also serves, says Andy Brief, director for account services at DeVito/Verdi, to help the campaign in “shedding the existing conventions” of rum advertising like depicting sunny beaches.

“There’s such an ingrained image of rum,” he adds. “And because it’s consumed with various mixers, the actual flavor of the rum goes unnoticed.”

“There has always been a feeling this category could use a different direction,” Mr. Brief says, “and along comes Appleton with this aging story similar to those you’d find with other brown goods” like Scotch, bourbon and Cognac.

To someone who is “used to drinking rum with a paper umbrella sticking out of it, it may be difficult” to accept rum as something to sip, he adds, “but to those used to brown drinks, it’s a discovery process.”

The print ads in the campaign are running in magazines like Black Enterprise, Esquire, Fast Company, Golf Digest, GQ, Men’s Journal, Out, The Robb Report and Wired. The outdoor ads are appearing on buildings, bus shelters and phone kiosks.

DeVito/Verdi and Kobrand are considering ideas for commercials, which would run on television and online.

473 2009-06-15 Brian Gay played his way into this week’s United States Open in his last possible chance, completing a wire-to-wire victory Sunday in the St. Jude Classic in Memphis, Tenn.

Gay earned his berth with his second win in his last five events and the third of his career. He beat David Toms and Bryce Molder by five strokes to grab the Open exemption as a multiple winner in the last calendar year.

He claimed the $1,008,000 winner’s check at T.P.C. Southwind in runaway style.

Gay led by only a stroke after each of the first three rounds, then shot a third straight four-under 66 to pull away. He birdied three of the first six holes to take all the suspense out of the final round, and birdied the 18th to finish at 18-under 262.

Phil Mickelson, in his first event since announcing wife, Amy, had breast cancer, and John Daly, returning from a six-month PGA Tour suspension, tied for 59th at one over. Mickelson closed with a 75, and Daly shot a 70.

“I needed to get a little bit of play in, see where my game was at and get back on the golf course in a competitive frame of mind if I was going to have a chance next week,” Mickelson said. Toms finished with a 65, and Molder had a 70. John Senden (64), Paul Goydos (68) and Robert Allenby (69) tied for fourth at 12 under.

475 2009-06-15 Medical liability is an important component of the debate, but that, too, is controversial. White House officials said Mr. Obama was likely to refer to the issue in his speech to the medical association, but would not offer any specific proposal.

Mr. Obama has not endorsed capping malpractice jury awards, as did his predecessor, President George W. Bush. But as a senator, he advanced legislation aimed at reducing malpractice suits. And Dr. J. James Rohack, the incoming president of the medical association, said Mr. Obama told him at a meeting last month that he was open to offering some liability protection to doctors who follow standard guidelines for medical practice.

“If everyone is focused on saying, ‘How do we get rid of unnecessary costs,’ ” Dr. Rohack said, recounting the conversation, “if we as physicians are going to say, ‘Here’s our guidelines, we will follow them,’ then we need to have some protections. He listened and he said, ‘Clearly, that concept is worthy of discussion.’ ”

Health care experts estimate that preventable medical errors kill more than 100,000 Americans each year, yet doctors and hospitals, fearing lawsuits, do not openly discuss their mistakes — an impediment to improving quality of care. At the same time, doctors complain that “defensive medicine” — ordering tests and procedures out of fear of being sued — drives up health costs.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats drafting health legislation have so far shown little appetite for tackling the liability issue. But one Republican who met with Mr. Obama in April recalled that the president said he was willing to go against his party to get medical malpractice reforms into a health bill — but that he would expect Republican support for the legislation if he did so.

Mr. Obama also raised the issue at a recent meeting with two dozen Senate Democrats, some who attended said.

“He’s touched on this issue at a number of meetings,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is also a proponent of liability reform. Mr. Wyden said the president articulated “the common sense message that if doctors act in line with their own professional guidelines, that ought to create a certain presumption that they have acted reasonably.”

As a senator, Mr. Obama joined Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2005 in proposing legislation aimed at reducing both medical errors and lawsuits through a program known as Sorry Works, rooted in the idea that injured patients value an apology as much as money. Their bill encouraged doctors and hospitals to investigate errors and apologize for mistakes, to facilitate what Mr. Obama described as “a reasonable settlement that keeps the case out of court.”

Although the A.M.A.’s highest legislative priority is capping jury awards, highly unlikely under the Obama administration, it does favor legislation like that proposed by Senators Obama and Clinton. Dr. Rohack said the group’s legislative experts were also working over the weekend to draft a bill that would set out a way to protect doctors who are sued if they have followed professional practice guidelines.

“We are supportive of anything that may reduce liability,” Dr. Rohack said, adding that he was heartened by Mr. Obama’s “recognition that defensive medicine contributes to unnecessary health costs.”

But to deliver a deal with doctors, Mr. Obama would probably have to defy senior members of his party in both houses of Congress. Many Democrats oppose putting limits on medical lawsuits because they believe it is ineffective and unfair to patients.

Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is expected to outline his proposal for a health care overhaul this week, and aides said liability protection for doctors is not part of the plan.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, resisted medical malpractice legislation when it was pushed by Republicans in the past. “The whole premise of a medical malpractice ‘crisis’ is unfounded,” Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor in 2006, in a speech that quoted extensively from a book titled “The Medical Malpractice Myth.”

And any effort to restrict patients’ legal rights to sue will face tough opposition from the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers and has met with Nancy-Ann DeParle, Mr. Obama’s point person for health reform, to express its concerns. Linda Lipsen, the association’s chief lobbyist, said practice guidelines were established by unregulated medical societies and “should not be conclusive” in a court of law.

The association may have an ally in Mr. Obama’s health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, who is a former director of the Kansas Trial Lawyers Association. But Mr. Obama’s first choice for health secretary, Tom Daschle, who advised the president throughout the campaign, was a strong proponent of linking evidence-based medicine with protections against lawsuits.

And another top health adviser to Mr. Obama, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, has written extensively on liability reform.

“There is no doubt that comprehensive health care reform requires a monumental change to the current malpractice system, which not only hurts both doctors and patients, but also is far too expensive,” Dr. Emanuel, the brother of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, wrote in a 2008 book, “Healthcare Guaranteed: A Simple, Secure Solution for America.”

But Mr. Obama has signaled that the solution may not be all that simple. Speaking to a group of chief executives in March, Mr. Obama said malpractice law changes should be part of the health care debate, although he conceded it would not be an easy sell.

“Medical liability issues — I think all those things have to be on the table,” Mr. Obama said. “And I won’t lie to you that everybody agrees on this theoretically until you start getting into the specifics.”
476 2009-06-15 In this version, subjects who often included students were shown a now-famous slide depicting typical passengers in a New York City subway car. At the center of the image stand two figures: a black man dressed in a natty suit and a white man in shirtsleeves holding a straight razor.

After being shown the slide, subjects were asked to describe it to others who had not seen it. These people then described it to others, who then passed on their descriptions as well. Those who had heard the story secondhand were then asked to recount it. More than half the time, the razor was said to be held not by the white man but by the well-dressed black man, who was sometimes described as brandishing it wildly.

This country has changed considerably in the more than 60 years since these data were published. But the mental calculus that shifted the razor into the black man’s hand is still very much a part of the American scene. It comes into play every day in courtrooms, in city streets and especially in job interviews.

People who believed that racism was on the wane were mightily shocked by the research into the effect of race on hiring policies that appeared in the 2007 book “Marked: Race, Crime and Finding Work in an Era of Mass Incarceration,” by the Princeton sociologist Devah Pager. After sending carefully selected test applicants to apply for low-level jobs with hundreds of employers, Ms. Pager found that criminal convictions for black men seeking employment were, in many contexts, “virtually impossible to overcome,” partly because those convictions reinforced powerful, longstanding stereotypes.

The stigma of conviction turned out to be less damaging for whites. Indeed, white men who claimed to be fresh out of prison were just as likely to be called back for second interviews as black men with no history of criminal involvement. The young black men were best-case applicants — bright, well-spoken college students posing as high school graduates. But racial stereotypes prevented employers from seeing their virtues.

“Being black in America today,” Ms. Pager writes, “is just about the same as having a felony conviction in terms of one’s chances of finding a job.”

People who believe that blunt-force racism is a thing of the past tend to gasp when they see this data. But the findings are consistent with what black job seekers and community organizations have been saying about their experiences for a long time.

All of this should come as sobering news to people who believe that the election of an African-American president moved the country into a new phase beyond racism. We may yet reach that goal. But we won’t do it by pretending that centuries-old biases were magically swept away in a single election. We can do it only by exorcising poisonous preconceptions that go to the very heart of who we are.
477 2009-06-15 There are more than 200,000 workplaces in New York State where fundamental labor standards do not apply, not even in theory. These are not sweatshops or salt mines. They are private homes, where housekeepers, nannies and caregivers for the elderly do work as important as it is isolated and unprotected.

The exclusion is a relic of the New Deal, when labor protections like overtime pay were written specifically to exclude domestic and farm labor. From exclusion it can be a short distance to abuse: to long hours, low pay, dehumanizing treatment, physical and sexual harassment.

Domestic workers and their advocates in New York have been pressing for reforms. They have been telling their stories in Albany and across the state and steadily gathering support for a Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights. The legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, would reform state labor law to provide basic protections like time-and-a-half pay for every hour over a 40-hour week; one day off a week; paid vacation and sick days; severance pay and health coverage — and a means of enforcing these standards in court.

Most other workers take these standards for granted. They don’t know what it’s like to have to show up for work sick rather than be fired, to be denied privacy and dignity, to be powerless to demand decent treatment from their employers.

Backers of the bill had been confident that this could finally be the year for a groundbreaking victory, at least before the recent power struggle brought the Capitol to new depths of shame, ridicule and paralysis.

If the Legislature decides to return to its senses and start passing meaningful legislation that improves New Yorkers’ lives, it should include the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights. Albany, which has not been able to govern its way out of a paper bag, should at least be able to bestow some fundamental rights and protections on the invisible workers whose labors are a cornerstone of the New York economy.
478 2009-06-15 One of the risks of this kind of improvised, headlong journalism is that reporters lack the backing of large established news organizations that might have the experience and leverage to deal with foreign governments. While Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, full-time employees of Current, have the backing of Al Gore, who is a founder of the network, they lack the support system that their colleagues at CNN and the British Broadcasting Corporation enjoy.

Current TV purposefully has kept quiet about Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, steadfastly declining to comment on their status. Initial news reports about the detainments were swiftly removed from the channel’s Web site in April. The two women’s profiles were scrubbed of any reference to the detainments.

When journalists are detained or otherwise endangered overseas, news organizations often decide not to comment as they work aggressively behind the scenes for the release of their employees. Joel Hyatt, the chief executive of Current, appeared in a jacket with the network’s logo at a vigil for them in San Francisco this month. “Current will continue to tell the important stories affecting our world that no one else is telling,” Mr. Hyatt said by e-mail on Sunday.

The families of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee have not criticized the network directly, but they did grant a series of interviews in early June after keeping quiet for months.

“Our families have been very quiet because of the extreme sensitivity of the situation, but given the fact that our girls are in the midst of a global nuclear standoff, we cannot wait any longer,” Ms. Ling’s older sister, Lisa, also a journalist, told supporters in a message to a Facebook group. She said the women “just wanted to tell the world a story.”

Current, which caters to an 18- to 34-year-old audience and has posted generally low ratings in its four years, tried to fill what it identified as a void in mainstream news coverage with the creation of “vanguard journalism,” a unit assembled to cover “untold stories around the globe,” as the network put it.

Ms. Ling is the vice president of the unit, which has received a number of coveted awards, including the duPont for a 2007 investigation of neo-Nazi violence in Russia. Ms. Lee is an editor with about a decade of film and TV experience. The trip in March to North Korea was her first overseas assignment.

They traveled together with a cameraman and a Chinese guide, but they were working without the broad safety net that a traditional news organization can provide. The cameraman, Mitch Koss, is an experienced journalist who has returned to the United States. He was reportedly questioned by Chinese authorities, and he was unavailable for comment last week.

At a big news outlet or a wire service, “they have resources that they can call upon to come to the aid” of journalists, said Robert Mahoney, the deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.

For example, he said, “they have access to the airwaves that is not to be underestimated.” When Alan Johnston, a reporter for the BBC, was kidnapped in Gaza in 2007, the network held rallies, organized petitions, arranged for a simulcast on competing networks, and placed advertisements in newspapers to put pressure on his captors and call for his release. He was released after nearly four months in custody.

Major outlets are also able to call on their existing diplomatic and military contacts for help.

“All that is fairly easy when you have a big organization standing behind you,” Mr. Mahoney said. “You have a huge treasure of resources behind you.”

Conversely, smaller outlets may not have as much support. The Committee to Protect Journalists found that in 2008, at least 56 of the 125 jailed journalists worked for online outlets and that 45 of the total were freelancers.

“These freelancers are not employees of media companies and often do not have the legal resources or political connections that might help them gain their freedom,” the committee reported.

As news divisions hit by the recession make cuts in foreign coverage, freelancers shoulder more of the risks. “Pretty soon we’re just not going to have any of the types of stories Laura and Euna went to cover,” said Daniel Beckmann, a friend of Ms. Ling and a former colleague at Current TV.

As journalism moves to the Web, new foreign news models and sources are emerging. The music magazine Vice and its video site VBS.tv produced videos from Iraq in 2006. This year, an ambitious new Web site called GlobalPost began, relying on freelancers in dozens of countries. And over the weekend, online sources like TehranBureau.com, which combines reporting from Iran with observations from outsiders and accepts donations, had surges of traffic as users sought information about the protests in that country.

News distributors are known to come to the aid of freelancers, as they did this year when Roxana Saberi was charged with espionage in Iran. The BBC, ABC, Fox News and National Public Radio released a joint statement and worked behind the scenes to secure her release. She was freed last month. Through a spokeswoman, she declined to comment, but she has said in interviews that she wants Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee to know that “you are not alone.”
479 2009-06-15 “This is the worst federal court takings decision since Kelo,” said Ilya Somin, who teaches property law at George Mason University and helped write the brief. “It’s very extreme, and it is significant as a window into Judge Sotomayor’s attitudes toward private property.”

But another author of the brief, Richard A. Epstein, said the decision in Mr. Didden’s case was a rare misfire that provided no larger insights into Judge Sotomayor’s thinking.

“It’s a disappointment and it’s wrong and it’s ill thought out,” Professor Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago and New York University, said of the ruling. “But it’s not one of six. It’s one of two.” (The other poorly handled decision, he said, was Ricci v. DeStefano, which rejected employment discrimination claims from white firefighters in New Haven.)

The case arose from a meeting in 2003 between Mr. Didden, who owned property in Port Chester, N.Y., and an executive of a company that had been designated by the village to develop a 27-acre urban renewal area that included part of the property. What happened at that meeting, Mr. Didden said, amounted to extortion.

Mr. Didden had made arrangements to put a CVS drug store on his lot. At the meeting, the executive, Gregg Wasser, demanded $800,000 as the price for permission to proceed with that project, Mr. Didden said in court papers. The alternative, Mr. Wasser said, according to the papers, was to have the village condemn Mr. Didden’s property so that Mr. Wasser’s company could put a Walgreen’s in the same place.

“Here is a private person standing in the shoes of the government with the power to condemn or not condemn,” Mr. Didden said. “The $800,000 wasn’t going to rehabilitate a public park or build a soccer stadium. It was going into his pocket.”

Mr. Didden refused. The next day the village condemned his property.

Mr. Wasser did not respond to a recent message seeking comment left with an assistant. In a sworn statement in 2004, he denied being “part of an ‘extortion’ plot” and said the accusation was “beyond my comprehension.” The meeting, he said, was a settlement negotiation concerning competing claims to the same property. “An $800,000 figure,” he said, “was an appropriate buyout.”

Mr. Didden and a business partner sued, and a federal judge dismissed their case in 2004. When the case reached Judge Sotomayor’s court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Mr. Didden said he had reason to be hopeful.

“She was highly engaged,” Mr. Didden said of Judge Sotomayor’s questioning at the argument in 2005. The other members of the panel were Judges Reena Raggi and Peter W. Hall.

“We felt like we got our day in court,” Mr. Didden said. “We felt that she got the point.”

But then more than a year passed. In the end, the decision was terse and unsigned, and it rejected Mr. Didden’s claims.

“It took 54 weeks to issue those four paragraphs,” Mr. Didden said. According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the median interval between argument and decision in the Second Circuit, both then and now, is less than a month.

The brief decision in Didden made two points. First, it said Mr. Didden had filed his suit too late. The village had announced the redevelopment plan in 1999, and Mr. Didden did not sue until 2004. His claim, the court said, was therefore barred by a three-year statute of limitations.

That was a curious ruling, Professor Epstein said, because it required Mr. Didden to sue over his claim of extortion before it happened.

The court also rejected Mr. Didden’s claim that Port Chester should not be allowed to take his property so that another company could build a different drug store. The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment — “nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation” — should not apply, he had argued, to such transfers.

Judge Roberts, at his confirmation hearings in 2005, seemed sympathetic to that kind of argument. The takings clause is uncontroversial when it is used to take property for public purposes like roads and schools. But it is a “basic proposition,” Judge Roberts added, that “government can’t take property from A and give it to B.”

No one disputes that Mr. Didden and his partner are entitled to be compensated for his property. Mr. Didden said the final amount had not been determined.

But Judges Roberts and Alito, at their confirmation hearings, said larger issues are involved in government takings.

“It touches some very sensitive nerves,” Judge Alito said. “Taking their home away and giving them money in return, even if they get fair market value for the home, is still an enormous loss for people.”

Judge Roberts, who said he had been surprised by the Kelo decision, said he welcomed new state laws “saying we do not authorize the use of the power of eminent domain to take for a use that’s going to be from one private owner to another.” Such laws, he said, are “certainly an appropriate reaction to a court’s decision in this area.”

He added that the author of the majority opinion in Kelo, Justice John Paul Stevens, had said at a bar association meeting that he would have voted against the takings plan had he been a legislator rather than a judge making a constitutional determination. “The free play of market forces is more likely to produce acceptable results in the long run than the best-intentioned plans of public officials,” Justice Stevens said in the speech.
480 2009-06-15 “Computer programmers, people from casinos, factory workers, salesmen, everything,” said Nick Gyftakis, the owner. “I’ve been in business more than 30 years, and we’ve never seen things like this before.”

Employers said the surge in applications was a drastic shift from recent years, when public pools and beaches in New Jersey occasionally had to close because there were not enough people willing to work as lifeguards.

But the same recession that has eliminated year-round jobs, thereby increasing the pool of available seasonal workers, has made employers at seasonal businesses reduce hiring by 10 to 20 percent compared with last year.

As for the jobs that are being filled, many business owners say they would rather hire students on summer break than their newly unemployed parents, because, they say, many older workers consider themselves overqualified to fry corndogs at $7.25 an hour and are liable to quit midsummer if a year-round job arises.

So while the number, and demographics, of the job applicants has changed because of the economic downturn, the work force staffing the arcades and beachfront bars this summer — as in summers past — will be overwhelmingly made up of high school and college students from the United States and abroad.

“It’s hard enough to bring yourself to actually apply for a job that pays, what, not even half of what you’re used to making,” said Laura Rozamus, 58, who looked for work along the boardwalk in Atlantic City after losing her job in customer service for Blue Cross. “But to be turned down, again and again, just makes you sad — and frustrated.”

It was not supposed to turn out this way.

After the economy faltered last fall, the State Department braced for a deluge of the newly unemployed to flock to resort communities, asking the companies that bring overseas students to the United States for the summer to reduce the number of seasonal workers by 20 percent. Andrew Laine, a State Department spokesman, said it is too early to tell whether the number of overseas workers will approach the 151,000 who came last summer, but employment companies say there are far fewer students here on summer visas.

That drop in foreign workers has been exceeded by a surge in applications from local residents who are out of work.

But with the recession raising concerns about a possible drop in tourist spending, many businesses are being cautious about hiring. The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development reports that the total number of jobs in the leisure and hospitality field — which includes restaurants, hotels and recreational facilities — dropped to 334,000 in April 2009 from 345,000 in April 2008, and business owners say they are still not certain what to expect this summer.

“There are all these people trying to support their families, and you want to help them all, but you can’t,” said Marilyn Schlossbach, who owns three restaurants in Asbury Park.

“It takes a lot of expertise to run an insurance office or be a financial adviser,” she said, “but those skills won’t necessarily help when it’s a busy night and there are eight tables backed up. And I can’t afford to train people once the season gets going.”

Jenkinson’s Pier hired about 1,700 summer workers to run its amusement park, boardwalk booths, aquarium, souvenir shops, restaurants and bars, but only one was an adult who had recently been recently laid off from a year-round job. Wonderland Pier in Ocean City hired 200 people as ride operators for the summer, including 10 recently unemployed. Those employees are expected to begin later this month, but there is no guarantee that the older workers will actually show up, according to John Cavachuk, who handles hiring for the company.

“One guy in his 40s started working last month, but he already quit because he got a better job doing what he wanted to do — being a mechanic,” Mr. Cavachuk said.

Ms. Schlossbach, the restaurant owner, did hire two older workers who recently lost their jobs. One of them, Kim Crawford, 42, moved back to New Jersey in February after more than a decade in San Francisco to take a new job as an account executive for a food wholesaler. Thirty-three days after she began her new job, Ms. Crawford said, she was laid off.

“After convincing me to move back here and promising that my position was secure, they told me that the New York economy was worse than they had anticipated,” said Ms. Crawford, who now waits tables at the Langosta Lounge along the beach in Asbury Park. “I thought I was at a point in my life where I was beyond waitressing. But I’m lucky to have steady work and good money to get me through the summer. And in the fall I can look for a real job.”

Others have not been nearly as fortunate. Barry Kramer of Toms River, a machinist, was laid off in February and spent weeks filling out applications for work in Ocean City. “The people doing the hiring say everything’s already taken,” he said. Mr. Kramer, 47, said he suspected that many employers in resort communities would rather hire younger workers to project a more youthful image.

Ms. Rozamus came to the Jersey Shore from Albany with her companion, figuring that between the casinos and annual influx of tourists, they would be able to find steady work and enjoy a summer on the beach. But the casinos have laid off workers, and Ms. Rozamus said the restaurants and attractions near the beach had no work for either of them. The couple is now living in a motel; she took a job as a housekeeper at a nearby inn and he has found a few days’ work through a temp agency.

“It’s a lot worse than we expected, but in Albany, there’s just no job prospects at all,” she said. “If we can’t find something better here soon, we’re going to try another resort area. It’s a long summer, so if we keep looking, something will happen, eventually.”
481 2009-06-15 For the last three weeks around Manhattan, workers on their lunch breaks have been competing outside office buildings with two tickets to this weekend’s United States Open as the prize. Monday, eight local winners from various city offices will compete in the contest final, to be held at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.

Contestants in the challenge were first required to make a sloping 4-foot putt and then progressively longer and more challenging putts. Andrew Raggio of Islip, N.Y., had not touched a golf club in two years when he returned to work after a midday stop at his bank to find a putting green outside the New York Stock Exchange.

“They were giving out free Odyssey golf hats, and I liked the hat, so I got in line,” said Raggio, referring to the putter maker Odyssey Golf, a sponsor of the event along with Tour Links Putting Greens.

Raggio made five consecutive putts, missed one putt and then made three more of various lengths. That was good enough to advance to the final.

“People started cheering pretty hard after I made the first four,” said Raggio, 38. “I’m a floor broker on the stock exchange. We don’t get rattled easily.”

Raggio hopes to win the Bethpage tickets so that he can root on Phil Mickelson, whose wife, Amy, was found to have breast cancer last month. Raggio’s wife and mother-in-law are breast cancer survivors, and a sister-in-law died from the disease last fall.
482 2009-06-15 Now, selling The Globe is not only thinkable, but also probable, perhaps more so now that the company failed to reach an agreement with one union, the Newspaper Guild, for additional cuts that would have delivered $10 million in savings.

So if The Globe’s on the block, what’s it worth? It is a question that every metropolitan daily owner, employee and reader in the country should be interested in because The Globe is not alone in its struggles. It is a 137-year-old newspaper that has a huge footprint in a vital city and region, a weekday circulation of just over 300,000 copies and a significant Web presence. Three buyers have expressed interest so far, according to The Boston Globe.

For a little reality therapy, I asked six people involved in the industry with track records in valuing media properties to assess The Globe. Their answers were surprising, both in their breadth — everything from $250 million to “we pay you to take this off our hands” — and, for some, in their optimism, especially for The Globe’s digital properties.

Their estimates are based on the following assumptions: that management will reach some sort of deal with the guild, that no other newspaper property would be involved, and that the company’s minority interest in the Boston Red Sox would not be part of the deal. (Full versions of their answers can be found at nytimes.com/mediadecoder.)

Mr. Edmonds put the pure asset value apart from the newspaper franchise at $75 million to $100 million and added that “someone who values the prestige and prospects might kick in $50 to $100 million more.” He thinks the company would do well to wait a year or more until the ad market settles down.

Mark M. Edmiston, managing partner at AdMedia Partners in New York:

Mr. Edmiston said selling a property that promises significant continuing losses is akin to selling it with a lot of debt attached. “In this case,” he said, “it is cash to the seller plus the accumulated deficit caused by not addressing the problem until now.

“A buyer has to budget several hundred million to finance operating losses, restructuring charges and investment in ‘new’ Boston Globe businesses,” he said, adding that he expects a turnaround in advertising and that without the losses, The Globe would be worth $350 million $400 million. But factoring in the losses, it becomes academic. The Globe, he writes, “may not have sufficient value for the Times to realize any cash from a buyer.”

Before answering the question, Mr. Morton expressed how deeply disappointed he was that the Times Company was thinking about selling The Globe.

With that off his chest, he said, “The Globe and its Web site were strong brand names and continued to have considerable influence throughout New England, and these factors alone have value despite the current losses.” His wild guess: “somewhere between $200 and $300 million, and if pressed for a single number I’d say $250 million.”

He added that, if a new owner is found, “any Globe employees still employed after the deal goes through will recall the contract they have just rejected as paradise compared with what a new owner will impose in cost-cutting.”

Mike Simonton, an analyst at Fitch Ratings and a close follower of the newspaper industry:

Both Mr. Simonton and Mr. Edmonds suggested that much of the projected losses at The Globe come from amortization and write-downs. He suggested that cash losses will probably be half of the $85 million projected.

“At an estimated cash burn pace of around $40 million and no agreement on labor concessions, we’d estimate the Times Company would have to pay a buyer around $20 to 40 million in order to sever their ties with this untenable cost.”

So the Times Company would have to pay to “sell” The Globe?

“At $20 million the buyer (or assumer of costs, as they might more appropriately be referred to as) would have a cushion of around six months to develop a cost and revenue plan,” he wrote.

“A year ago, no one would have been saying that The Boston Globe has no value. But the media world has changed dramatically since then,” he wrote. “I think the range of values that the New York Times Company is likely to get for The Boston Globe are, at the high end, not more than $50 million and, at the low end, a requirement to help fund the buyer’s acquisition with as much as $25 million contributed by The New York Times (yes, you read that right!).”

“The best guesstimate of the real price: a buck. The best of an announced price: between $50 and $100 million,” he wrote in an e-mail message. The devil will be in the details of the obligations that a buyer would assume, he said, adding that “a buck essentially represents a gentleman’s agreement: I take a liability, headache and a distraction off your hands.”

He said that the Times Company could hang on to some pension liabilities or other obligations in exchange for a higher purchase price, a number that would give the appearance that it was getting something for the more than $1 billion it paid 16 years ago. He added that no bank would be interested in financing a deal given how other deals have blown up, so “the owner’s own money is immediately at risk.”

No consensus, but most of the experts who judge media properties for a living seem to be saying that the only way The New York Times Company can unlock any value from The Boston Globe is to get the newspaper’s losses off its books. Next time you’re in line at Starbucks and buying a $2 cup of coffee, you might want to consider that you could have bought one of America’s most storied newspaper franchises for less.

495 2009-06-16 To succeed at running a business takes confidence. You make decisions in a hurry, often with imperfect information. That’s life in the real world.

But the skills that serve so well in nurturing a family business or start-up may not serve when it comes to investing the money you take off the table, where you’re up against other people who spend all day, every day, thinking about stocks and bonds. A friend of mine is a genius at turning $2 million houses into $4 million houses, but he let his banker put his profits into auction-rate securities just before that market froze. Now he can’t get his cash to capitalize on today’s great housing deals.

Another friend runs a successful equipment rental chain. He used a margin account to raise cash for some personal expenses, preferring to borrow at low rates and keep his investments in place. But when stocks dived last winter he had to bolt from a lunch to meet a margin call  not a welcome distraction when he was working around the clock to save his business.

Sure, some small-business people are great investors. But be honest: if you devote 60, 80 or 100 hours a week to your business, do you really have time to read 100 prospectuses to find 10 good stocks? Many financial experts say that despite their business acumen, business owners tend to be fish out of water as investors, quick to fall prey to overconfidence and a sweet line from a self-serving adviser (or a brother-in-law).

If any of this rings true, this guide and a regular blog feature called The Owner’s Money are for you. Their underlying principle: You take plenty of risk in your business; as an investor, you should keep it simple, spread your eggs among many baskets, keep fees and taxes low and tilt the odds in your favor with indexed mutual funds and exchange traded funds.

At the same time, I understand the entrepreneurial mentality. Entrepreneurs tend to be thrill-seekers. They like to test themselves. They like to take chances. For those who want to devote some play money to more aggressive ideas ... well, I’ll talk about that, too. That will be fun.

But the smart investor will commit only a sliver of assets to that kind of gamble, certainly no more than 10 percent. For the rest of your money, you should construct a supersimple portfolio, one that requires little maintenance. You could do far worse than to simply split your funds among the following (I explain how to allocate below):

For stocks, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX). It is an index fund designed to mirror the performance of the entire United States stock market.

For bonds, the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX). This, too, is an indexer, designed to track the entire market of investment-grade bonds in the United States.

For cash, the Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX). This fund invests in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the federal government. It is relatively safe and has been yielding upward of 4 percent.

Other fund companies, like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, offer similar funds that are perfectly good. I’ve suggested Vanguard because it specializes in index funds and because, while most fund firms are for-profit operations run for the benefit of shareholders, Vanguard is owned by the people who invest in its products. Vanguard keeps expenses to the bare minimum.

In most years, index funds, intended to mirror the market’s performance, tend to do better than actively managed funds that constantly scramble for the next hot holding. The average active manager cannot beat the market, and trying to do so, he racks up costs that chew away at returns.

The model portfolio above is aimed at conforming to what I consider nine proven principles for keeping an investment strategy simple while enhancing prospects for solid returns over the long term. These principles are meant as a starting point rather than a final plan. Use them to guide your do-it-yourself investing, or to put the burden of proof on any adviser who suggests something more complex. Your first question should be: “Why would that be better than the simple strategy I’m already following?”

The keep-it-simple approach can help you sleep at night, free of the second-guessing and doubt that plague aggressive traders seduced by the latest fads.

ALLOCATE PROPERLY. Study after study concludes that the single most important factor in investing success is asset allocation  the mix of stocks, bonds and cash in a portfolio. Over the long term, stocks have earned in the neighborhood of 10 percent a year, enough to double your money every seven years. But stocks  as we’ve been reminded recently  are too risky for money you will need in the next five to 10 years. The bulk of that money should go into bonds, which are less volatile, though also less profitable, averaging returns of around 5 percent a year. Cash, like bank savings and money-market funds, is very safe but generally earns nothing once inflation has done its damage. A common rule of thumb says one should keep enough cash for 6 to 12 months of expenses. Of the remaining holdings, the bond portion should equal one’s age, i.e. 50 percent for a 50-year-old. The rest of your portfolio should be in stocks.

504 2009-06-16 Re “The Ban on Gays in the Military” (editorial, June 10):

We applaud the editorial advocating a swift end to the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. We, too, think President Obama should consider all viable options he can take on his own to get rid of this discriminatory law, including issuing a “stop-loss” order.

Whatever action the president decides to take, however, must serve as a catalyst to kick-start the legislative process in Congress, where the ultimate prize — undoing the law — will be won. It’s time for the Obama administration to present its plan for repeal, in writing, to Congress.

Many lawmakers are looking to Mr. Obama for his guidance. So are the estimated 65,000 gay and lesbian active-duty service members. And so, too, according to the latest Gallup poll, are a majority of conservatives and weekly churchgoers who now support allowing gay people to serve their country openly.
505 2009-06-16 The Obama administration, which came to office promising to protect gay rights but so far has not done much, actually struck a blow for the other side last week. It submitted a disturbing brief in support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which is the law that protects the right of states to not recognize and denies same-sex married couples federal benefits. The administration needs a new direction on gay rights.

A gay couple married under law is challenging the act in federal court. In its brief, the Justice Department argues that the couple lack legal standing to do so. It goes on to contend that even if they have standing, the case should be dismissed on the merits.

The brief insists it is reasonable for states to favor heterosexual marriages because they are the “traditional and universally recognized form of marriage.” In arguing that other states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages under the Constitution’s “full faith and ” clause, the Justice Department cites decades-old cases ruling that states do not have to recognize marriages between cousins or an uncle and a niece.

These are comparisons that understandably rankle many gay people. In a letter to on Monday, Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, said, “I cannot overstate the pain that we feel as human beings and as families when we read an argument, presented in federal court, implying that our own marriages have no more constitutional standing than incestuous ones.”

The brief also maintains that the Defense of Marriage Act represents a “cautious policy of federal neutrality” — an odd assertion since the law clearly discriminates against gay couples. Under the act, same-sex married couples who pay their are ineligible for the sort of federal benefits — such as survivors’ payments and joint tax returns — that heterosexual married couples receive.

In the presidential campaign, President Obama declared that he would work to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. Now, the administration appears to be defending it out of a sense of obligation to support a validly enacted Congressional law. There is a strong presumption that the Justice Department will defend federal laws, but it is not an inviolable rule.
506 2009-06-16 Bombardier is reducing its 10-year industry forecast for business jet deliveries by nearly 15 percent from last year because of the global recession. The company says it now expects there will be 11,500 business jets delivered by the industry from 2009 to 2018. Waning demand for business planes has forced manufacturers to lay off thousands of employees as they reduce production. Bombardier has announced that 4,360 employees will be laid off in Canada, the United States and Northern Ireland.
507 2009-06-16 “The way they’ve done the rough since Winged Foot has been great, where it’s been a gradual progression of higher rough the farther off line you get,” Steve Stricker said earlier this month. “I think Mike wanted to restore some of that fairness to the game which we weren’t seeing at times in some other Opens.

“You know, I think it’s been, as far as major tournaments go, probably the fairest of them all lately.”

Andy North, winner of the United States Open in 1978 and 1985, agreed with Stricker.

“I think Mike has done a fantastic job, right from the start, when he introduced the graduated rough,” North said Monday. “I always thought it was ridiculous that you could miss the fairway by a couple of yards and be dead and miss it by 25 yards and have a shot.”

The intriguing thing about all this is that there have not been any low scores accompanying the high praise for Davis’s setups. Geoff Ogilvy shot five over par to win at Winged Foot in 2006. Angel Cabrera shot five over par to win at Oakmont the next year. And Tiger Woods and Rocco Mediate each shot one under to tie last year. They then each shot even-par 71 in an 18-hole Monday playoff, won by Woods with a par on the first hole of sudden death.

“A lot of that had to do with the weather we got,” Davis said. “Oakmont and Winged Foot were dry and we had breeze. Had it been soft and there hadn’t been breeze, I really think you would have seen under par win both those. So much of it truly has to do with what Mother Nature gives you.”

True. But there are many pieces to the setup puzzle, something the final arbiter on the length of the rough, the speed of the greens, the width of the fairways and the positions of the holes knows well. The temptation that accompanies a decent lie in the rough may, on the whole, be hard to resist.

The idea of making birdie from the first cut of rough, or trying to drive a shortened par 4 to set up an eagle, are not easy to dismiss from a golfer’s thoughts.

“The idea is to give players more choices,” Davis said. “You’re kind of holding a carrot out there saying, ‘Hey, we’re going to give you this opportunity, but you have to really hit a good shot and if you don’t hit a good shot you will be worse off than if you had played it conservatively.’ I think that’s fun.”

Fun? Did the heir to the powerful position held previously by four more dour men — Joseph C. Dey, P. J. Boatright, David Eger and Meeks — use the word fun in reference to the United States Open?

Yes. Yes, he did. But do not get the wrong idea. He did not say easy. He did point out that tempting a player to play outside his comfort zone can result in harsh penalties, as when medium-hitting Jim Furyk twice tried to drive the green at driveable par-4s at Oakmont in ’07 and made two bogeys. He lost the Open by a stroke — for the second straight year.

“He could have hit 5-iron off each of those tees and had pitching wedge in,” Davis said. “And the worst he would have done is to win the U.S. Open by one, and he probably would have won it by two.”

That is the double-edged method to what Davis does. This week the 210-yard, par-3 eighth hole might play 50 yards shorter, with a front hole position that will bring the pond into play. Now that is fun.

“And it’s what keeps it interesting,” North said. “It’s not the exact same thing all the time. That’s what Mike has done so well with his setups.”
508 2009-06-16 Amid the wreckage of , intellectuals and policymakers looked to fascist and the Soviet Union for inspiration. But it’s hard to imagine anyone seeing a model in the current crop of authoritarian governments. It’s much easier to imagine them being swept away, if the endures, by domestic discontent.

Maybe something worse would take their place. Certainly there are authoritarian states — , — where the danger of an Islamist revolution should keep American policymakers awake at night.

But as an ideological rival to liberal democracy, Islamism isn’t in the same league with the totalitarianisms of the 1930s. And there aren’t any other likely candidates on the horizon. Indeed, for all the talk about a crisis of global capitalism, what’s most striking about the great financial meltdown is how little radicalism it’s spawned.

In the West, especially, there’s been more hysteria about the specter of extremism than actual radical activity. If you listen to certain conservative media personalities, you’d think Obama is channeling Leon Trotsky. If you listen to certain liberal pundits, you’d think that talk radio was fomenting a wave of right-wing violence.

But nothing of the sort is happening. is pushing the leftward, but his wish list — universal health care, a green industrial policy — has been pinned to the ’s bulletin board since the 1970s. and do not, in fact, command an army of gun-toting vigilantes, the crimes of a few lunatics notwithstanding. And in Europe, despite the angst over a few penny-ante racists getting themselves elected to the E.U. , the crisis’s major beneficiaries have been the cautious, incrementalist parties of the center-right.

In Iran, students are protesting for democracy and shouting for Obama. In the West, meanwhile, nobody’s talking about adopting Putinist economic nationalism, or renovating the financial sector using the tenets of the Islamic banking system, or imitating Hugo Chavez’s “Bolivarian Socialism.” (You’ll sometimes hear admiring comments about ’s recent economic management — but never their one-party dictatorship.)

Our current global economic crisis was created by Western-style democratic capitalism. But it hasn’t turned into a crisis for democracy and capitalism, because nobody has a plausible alternative.

The appeal of authoritarianism, once upon a time, was based on the hope that it might deliver growth, prosperity, and happiness more efficiently than its liberal rivals. But nobody thinks that anymore — not in Washington or or or , and not, on the evidence of this week’s events, in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Which is why, if the West is fortunate, the current crisis could reverse the pattern of the Great Depression - by demonstrating the resilience of a global democratic order, and the weakness of its challengers.
509 2009-06-16 “Legally, if you commit wire fraud or mail fraud, there’s a lot of very stiff penalties for that, where we don’t have a lot of precedents, legally, from an Internet perspective yet,” he said. “It’s really meant to try to create more of a legal precedent, and more of a legal library of cases to draw from in the future.”

Gordon Lam, reached on Monday evening, said he had not yet seen the filing and could not comment further.

Microsoft said it found a pattern of click fraud on its search pages, where lists ranked by relevance and popularity appear alongside a handful of paid results. Advertisers bid on what they will pay to appear in the paid-search results for certain keywords. The more an advertiser pays, the higher they are in that list, and advertisers usually pay for each click on their ad.

In March 2008, several auto insurance advertisers began complaining to Microsoft that traffic to their ads was spiking suspiciously. Microsoft looked at the searches being conducted, and noticed that searches for keywords like “auto insurance quote” had sharply increased. And clicks to the advertisers appearing at the top of the paid-search results listings for those terms were high.

Microsoft investigators noticed there was an oddly similar pattern in a seemingly unrelated area, advertisements for the game World of Warcraft. Though investigators weren’t sure how the two were connected, they began to see some similarities. Although traffic appeared to come from different computers, it was actually coming from two proxy servers, which mask the original address of a click.

Microsoft began trying to stop the suspect traffic, but a little game evolved. Microsoft would block a server, or block a certain level of traffic for those advertisements, but whoever was on the other side of the clicks kept finding new ways around the company’s fixes.

“They’re basically just trying to figure out what our filters and technology tools are going to flag, and seeing if they can change their thresholds to get around it,” Mr. Cranton said. “Then we figure out what they’ve done and we change our thresholds, and it goes back and forth.”

Microsoft didn’t know why someone would be interested in both World of Warcraft and auto insurance ads, though, until a third party told investigators that an advertiser for World of Warcraft keywords named Eric Lam was also taking a fee for directing traffic to auto insurance sites. Investigators figured out that seven different accounts, registered under different individual and company names, were linked to Mr. Lam and two other defendants, Gordon Lam and Melanie Suen, believed to be Mr. Lam’s brother and mother.

Microsoft’s theory is that Mr. Lam was running or working for low-ranking sites that took potential client information for auto insurers. The complaint said that he directed traffic to competitors’ Web sites so they would pay for those clicks and exhaust their advertising budgets quickly, which let the lower-ranking sites that he sponsored move up in the paid-search results.

When people clicked through to his site, it asked them to supply contact information, which he then resold to auto insurance companies, according to Microsoft’s complaint, which estimated his profit at $250,000. In the complaint, it also said it had to credit back $1.5 million to advertisers because of the Lams’ alleged fake clicks. Microsoft is seeking $750,000 in damages from the defendants.

Although small advertisers have sued search firms, complaining the firms did not do enough to prevent fraudulent clicks, this is among the first cases where a search provider has gone after a suspected perpetrator.

While Mr. Cranton said that this was not a gigantic case for Microsoft, he said the fraud was “significant.”

“We think there’s a good place for enforcement, basically to say, ‘You think this is a game, cat and mouse, back and forth. At some point, once we figure out who you are, we’re going to hold you accountable for it, it’s going to be expensive, and we’re going to deter you from doing it because you’re ripping off advertisers and people online,’ ” he said.
510 2009-06-16 They say many credit card issuers have revised internal guidelines to give front-line employees the power to cut deals with consumers. The workers do not even have to wait for customers to call and ask for a break.

“Now it’s the card company calling you and saying, ‘Let’s talk turkey,’ ” said , publisher of the industry journal The Nilson Report.

Only a few creditors are willing to confirm the practice. and say they decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept less than the full balance. Other card companies refuse to discuss the subject, but their trade group, the American Bankers Association, acknowledges that settlements are becoming more common.

The shift comes as the financial services industry finds itself losing some of its legendary power. A credit card reform bill that makes it harder to raise rates on existing balances and prevents certain automatic fees flew through Congress and was signed by in late May.

Borrowers still have a crushing amount of debt to deal with, however.

Revolving credit, a close approximation of credit card debt, totaled $939.6 billion in . The Federal reported that 6.5 percent of credit card debt was at least 30 days past due in the first quarter, the highest percentage since it began tracking the number in 1991. The amount being written off was also at peak levels.

After a balance has been delinquent for six months, regulations require the card company to reduce the value of the debt on its books to zero. If a borrower has not paid by this point, chances are he never will.

“The creditors would rather have a piece of something now instead of absolutely nothing down the road,” said Adam K. Levin, the founder of the consumer education Web site .

Banks and credit card companies are discussing new programs that would, for the first time, allow credit counselors to invoke reductions of principal as a routine part of their strategy, said Jeffrey S. Tenenbaum, a lawyer for many counseling agencies. In the past, counselors could persuade card issuers to adjust interest rates and modify late fees, but the balance was untouchable.

An example of how quickly the card companies are shifting their approach is in the behavior of , a major issuer, toward Mr. McClelland.

He was paying fitfully on his card, which was canceled for delinquency. In April, HSBC offered him full settlement at 20 percent off. He declined. A few weeks later, it agreed to let him pay half.

Traditionally, the creditors could play tough with any accounts that became delinquent because the cardholders had assets. The creditors could sue or place a lien on a cardholder’s house.

As the grinds on, though, many cardholders have less to lose. Mr. McClelland, 42, is a renter. Since he is self-employed, he has no wages to garnish. But he did not want to feel like a deadbeat.

“Having this over and done with was appealing,” he said. He raised the agreed-upon $2,743 and sent it off electronically last week. He has spared himself the prospect of years of collection calls.

HSBC said it did not comment on individual cardholders and would not discuss its policy toward settlements. “Every customer situation is unique,” said a spokeswoman, Cindy Savio.

The card companies, perhaps understandably, do not want to promote the idea that settlements have become merely a matter of asking nicely. The creditors also point out that a delinquency, like a foreclosure, destroys a credit record.

And there can be a : those with the fewest assets are the likeliest to receive a settlement offer, but they are also the least able to come up with the cash for that final negotiated payment. Some creditors, though, are helpfully letting people stretch this out over months.

Still, a line has been crossed, credit experts say.

“Even in the early stages of delinquency, settlements can be dramatic,” said Carmine Dorio, a longtime industry executive who ran collection departments for Citibank, Bank of America and .

During the boom, nonpayers were treated more harshly because, paradoxically, their debt was more valuable. Collection agencies were eager to buy bundles of old debt from the card companies for as much as 15 cents on the dollar. In a healthy economy, even the hopelessly indebted can pay something.

In this recession, where collection agencies have little hope of collecting from the unemployed, that business model is suffering. Experts say 5 cents on the dollar is now the most a card company can hope to get for its past-due accounts.

Another factor undermining the card companies is the rise of debt settlement firms. These are profit-making companies that charge fees, nearly always in advance, to bargain with creditors on a consumer’s behalf.

Settlement companies are under fire from regulators, who say they promise much and deliver little. But their ubiquitous ads, which make a settlement seem not only easy but also a moral victory over shamelessly gouging card companies, have done much to spread the idea.

Although there are few independent statistics on the settlement industry, there is no doubt that some generous deals are being done.

Consider Bedros Alikcioglu, a gas station owner in Newport Beach, Calif. He owed $112,000 on four cards and was paying $3,000 a month in interest and late fees. “It was so hard to earn that money, and paying it to nowhere didn’t make sense anymore,” said Mr. Alikcioglu, 75.

He signed up with a debt settlement company named Hope Financial, which negotiated deals with his creditors to settle for about 35 percent of his balance. Hope Financial is charging Mr. Alikcioglu about 12 percent of his original debt.

“I did not want to leave the legacy of bankruptcy,” Mr. Alikcioglu said. “I am now at peace.”
511 2009-06-16 Prime Minister Yehude Simon said Monday that he would ask Congress to revoke laws aimed at increasing foreign investment in the Amazon rain forest after clashes early this month between the police and indigenous groups that opposed the laws left at least 34 people dead. Mr. Simon, left, signed a pact with tribal leaders in the jungle city of San Ramón that included a promise to present a bill in Congress by Thursday to rescind the laws, the Andina state news agency reported. Tribal leaders said they would call off the protests if the laws were lifted.
512 2009-06-16 PARIS — The Universal Music Group and Virgin Media said on Monday that they had reached a deal that would offer consumers unlimited downloads as part of a partnership that steps up antipiracy enforcement.

Universal, the largest recording company in the world, said it would offer its entire catalog — which contains works by artists like Amy Winehouse and U2 — to customers of Virgin Media for a monthly subscription.

The music will be free from copy protection, a feature that distinguishes the service from most existing subscription offerings. The cost of the service, which will probably start by the end of the year, was not disclosed.

In return, Virgin Media, the British cable television and broadband provider, agreed to take steps to reduce piracy on its network, something that other broadband providers have resisted.

The measures could include temporary suspensions of offenders’ Internet connections, the company said.
513 2009-06-16 “There remains some risk to the freight side, but also an opportunity,” Mr. Carson said. “The next six months are going to be incredibly important to us as we watch to see if inventory rebuilding begins — which I believe it will.”

Mr. Carson added that he believed the current credit squeeze affecting airlines would be short-lived and that a “more normal trend” in lending would emerge by the second half of 2010.

Mr. Carson’s optimism was not universally shared by other participants at the Paris Air Show, however, where a thick gray mantle of clouds hung over the opening day’s proceedings.

“You’ve got to look at the postrecession environment,” said Sash Tusa, an independent aerospace industry consultant in London. “What will be the effect of a rising interest-rate environment?”

The global economic slowdown has hit the airline industry hard, with passenger traffic expected to fall by 8 percent this year. Just this month, the International Air Transport Association nearly doubled its forecast for 2009 industry losses to $9 billion from a prediction of $4.7 billion. The industry lost $10.4 billion in 2008.

“I think the winter is going to be horrible” for air travel, said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace and airline industry analyst with Evolution Securities in London. “Returning to growth again is still about another year out — in other words, you’re looking at another 12 months of traffic still declining.”

“This is not a recovery,” Mr. Cunningham said. “This is just the worst juncture for year-on-year decline.”

Airbus, for its part, remains decidedly more cautious. During the weekend, Louis Gallois, chief executive of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, known as EADS, the parent company of Airbus, said that it was still impossible to predict when an economic turnaround might come. “We have no capacity now to see what will be the depth of the crisis,” Mr. Gallois said.

Boeing, based in Chicago, last week lowered its 20-year market forecast for the first time in 10 years, albeit only slightly. The company said annual air traffic growth, which has averaged more than 5 percent in the last 30 years, would dip to 4.9 percent a year in the next two decades. Aircraft deliveries for the period would fall by just 400 planes to 29,000, Boeing predicted.

Randy J. Tinseth, vice president for marketing of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, acknowledged that the forecast was based on assumptions made this year about air traffic trends, which at the time assumed only a 5 percent decline in passenger traffic. Boeing plans to publish a revised forecast after the summer, Mr. Tinseth said.

Mr. Carson said he did not expect the credit crisis to have a significant impact on the company’s near-term deliveries. Boeing has a total order book valued at around $265 billion, currently equivalent to around seven years of production.

“We believe we have the most coveted backlog in this industry — perhaps in the history of this industry,” Mr. Carson said.

Included in that backlog are about 860 jets of the company’s newest flagship model, the 787 Dreamliner, which is due to make its first flight this month. The first 787 delivery, to All Nippon Airways of Japan, is scheduled for the first quarter of 2010. Mr. Carson said he did not foresee any financing trouble for the airlines lined up to buy the first of these jets.

The 787 backlog extends into 2020, he added, “so that’s a very long time with lots of opportunity for economic recovery.”

Separately, Bob Smith, chief innovation officer at the avionics company Honeywell, said that Asia — which has had some of the world’s fastest expansion in air traffic in recent years — was holding up relatively well.

China and India were still experiencing healthy growth, he added, saying, “For the aviation world, that’s important.”
514 2009-06-16 President Obama made good on a campaign promise to have an American Indian adviser in the White House to counsel him on tribal issues. He appointed Kimberly Teehee as a senior policy adviser for Native American affairs. Ms. Teehee is a member of the Cherokee Nation and has worked for Representative Dale E. Kildee, Democrat of Michigan, for the last decade. She will be a member of Mr. Obama’s domestic policy council.
515 2009-06-16 Lincoln National, the insurance company, said on Monday that it would take nearly $1 billion in federal bailout money, issue new stock and debt, and sell its British insurance business in an effort to shore up its deteriorating capital base.

The insurer, based in Philadelphia, said in a statement that it was seeking to raise about $2 billion. About $950 million of that will come from issuing preferred stock to the government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program run by the Treasury Department. Lincoln National will be the second insurer to take money from the program since the Treasury approved six major insurance companies for relief money. Hartford Financial said on Friday that it would take $3.4 billion.

The company also said it would also sell its British insurance unit for £195 million ($319 million) in cash to Sun Life of Canada. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter of the year.

Lincoln also said it would sell $500 million in new senior debt and issue $600 million in new common stock, diluting existing shareholders.

“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital and liquidity, and solidify the company’s capital positions at both the subsidiary and holding company levels,” the company said in its statement.

The company said it intended to contribute about $1 billion of the proceeds to its principal insurance subsidiary, the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, with the remaining $1 billion to be held at the holding company level for “general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term debt and investment in the company’s core businesses.”
516 2009-06-16 The eating habits of American children appear to be shifting. And for a change, the news is good.

Chicken nuggets, burgers, fries and colas remain popular with the under-13 set, of course. But new market research shows that consumption of these foods at restaurants is declining, while soup, yogurt, fruit, grilled chicken and chocolate milk are on the rise.

The findings, based on survey data by the Chicago market research firm NPD Group, follow a report last year that childhood obesity appears to have hit a plateau after rising for more than two decades. That finding, reported by The Journal of the American Medical Association, has been greeted with guarded optimism, and it remains unclear whether efforts to limit junk food and increase physical activity in schools have had a meaningful effect on the way children eat.

But the new data suggest that a number of factors, from the economic downturn to new offerings from fast-food giants, may be influencing a general shift in eating preferences among children.

The data, from NPD’s Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends, are collected from a representative sample of 3,500 households and 500 teenagers who give detailed information on their restaurant habits. The figures are considered highly reliable because the researchers collect answers daily, asking participants what they and their family ate and ordered at restaurants the day before. While this recall method is never 100 percent reliable, the data, collected since 1976, provide a consistent look at long-term trends.

Clearly, the economy is playing a big part in these trends. Orders for kids’ meals that included a toy were down 11 percent last year, for example, while “value menu” orders were up 9 percent. More recently, children’s orders for cold-cut sandwiches are up 11 percent, a surge that appears to be driven largely by the fast-food chain Subway’s “$5 foot-long” campaign. And after more than three years of growth, restaurant birthday parties for children dropped 5 percent in the quarter ending in February, compared with the same quarter last year.

But economics cannot explain the entire shift, said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant analyst for NPD. Cheeseburgers, fries and colas are all on value menus, but their consumption among children under 13 has fallen while healthier foods are on the rise.

Among the losers in the year ending March 31 were colas (down 10 percent), chicken nuggets and strips (8 percent), French fries (7 percent) and hot dogs (6 percent). Winners included soup (29 percent), grilled chicken sandwiches (26 percent), yogurt (21 percent), carrots (9 percent) and fruit (6 percent).

Even pizza is losing favor. While it is still the most popular food for children in quick-service restaurants, its year-to-year growth is flat, according to NPD. And in full-service restaurants, it has been replaced by pasta as the most popular food among children.

“Kids’ tastes and preferences are changing,” Ms. Riggs said, adding that they want “more choices and sophisticated fare.”

To be sure, pizza, burgers, fries and kids’ meals are still the most popular items ordered by children; the percentage gains for items like soup and yogurt are from a smaller base. But the trends bolster an argument that children’s health researchers have made for years: if you offer more healthful food, kids will eat it.

And many restaurants are taking the hint. Last month, Burger King announced three new kids’ meals that include small burgers, sliced apples that look like French fries, reduced-sodium chicken tenders, calcium-fortified apple juice and fat-free chocolate milk. McDonald’s offers apples and yogurt, and Wendy’s kids’ meals include mandarin oranges.

“The food industry is always saying, ‘We’re giving people want they want; that’s why we’re giving you chicken nuggets, burgers and fries for your kids,’ ” said Leann L. Birch, director of the Center for Childhood Obesity Research at Penn State. “That’s not really true. If kids are given different options and if parents make them available and let them choose some of those things, I think quite often we see you do get shifts in eating.”

Not every choice is resulting in a more healthful meal. For instance, the NPD data show that breaded chicken sandwiches are on the rise while burgers are declining. On the Wendy’s kids’ menu, the breaded chicken has 340 calories, and a junior cheeseburger has 270.

Among beverage orders, milk consumption is on the rise and colas are down. But orange and grapefruit sodas and root beer are rising.

“The perception might be that orange and grapefruit soda are better for you,” Ms. Riggs said.

Still, it is noteworthy that the NPD data are based on orders in restaurants, where children are often allowed to make their own choices.

“We don’t know how many choices kids really make,” Dr. Birch said. “But my sense is that parents are much more likely to be hands-off in a restaurant situation and allow kids the freedom to make more choices.

“You go to these places where they offer healthy options for adults. But until recently, kids haven’t had the opportunity to choose the right thing.”
517 2009-06-16 Re “Is This a Pandemic? Define ‘Pandemic’ ” (The Doctor’s World, June 9): It isn’t only how we define “pandemic” that has caused confusion on how to deal with H1N1 swine influenza, but our failure to recognize that we have been losing the war on bugs because of our piteous lack of investment in global health research.

In our zeal to trumpet the many advances of modern medicine, we have overestimated our ability to defend against local and global epidemics. What is badly needed is vigorous research on the biology of viruses and other pathogens as one of the keys to survival. Failure to act makes global contamination of our species by disease hypothetically possible.
518 2009-06-16 You know that guilty look your dog gets, like when you come home and find it’s chewed up your favorite pair of Manolo Blahniks?

Scientists cannot say, yet, whether your dog is really feeling guilty about such transgressions. But they can say this: your dog’s look is related not so much to what it did, but to what you did.

Alexandra Horowitz of Barnard College’s psychology department studies animal cognition, and has long been fascinated with the way dog owners anthropomorphize their pets’ behavior — ascribing to them human emotions like jealousy and guilt. “I wanted to look at some of these attributes and see if there’s anything behind them,” she said.

She conducted experiments with dogs and their owners in which the owner showed the dog a treat, told it not to eat it, and left the room. While the owner was absent the dog was given the treat or it was removed. In some of the trials, upon returning the owner was deliberately misinformed — told that the dog had disobeyed, for example, when it had not eaten the treat. If the owner was told the dog disobeyed, it got a scolding.

Dr. Horowitz found that behaviors associated with the “guilty look” — slinking away, ducking the head and dropping the tail, among others — occurred regardless of whether the dog had disobeyed or not. Instead, what was important was the owner’s reaction. There were far more “guilty” behaviors when the owners scolded the dogs. The findings are published in the journal Behavioral Processes.

Dr. Horowitz said that the results show that dogs have learned to act in a certain way in response to their owners’ behavior: “We’ve trained them that when they see us angry, they give us that guilty look.”
519 2009-06-16 “The purpose of this bill is to let people know we have state sovereignty and the federal government has no business telling us what to do,” State Senator Mae Beavers, a Mount Juliet Republican who sponsored the bill, said in an interview.

The new laws in Tennessee, coming soon after the recent shooting in a church in Kansas of a doctor who performed late-term abortions, and the shooting of a guard at the Holocaust museum in Washington, have prompted intense comment on local Web sites like www.commercialappeal.com, www.knoxnews.com and www.tennessean.com.

Brian Malte, director of state legislation for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said Tennessee already had among the least restrictive gun laws in the country. Still, Mr. Malte said, the flurry of pro-gun bills was highly unusual and reflected a push by the gun lobby in a state with a newly sympathetic legislature, of which both houses are now controlled by Republicans.

Gun-rights advocates say expanded rights are needed so that law-abiding citizens can protect themselves in more situations. The new Tennessee laws also include measures that will allow permit holders to carry guns in bars and restaurants, if they are not drinking alcohol, and to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in their vehicles if the ammunition is in the magazine but not in the chamber, although it can be in the chamber for purposes of self-defense.

The new law exempting the state from federal gun regulations is less about the Second Amendment, involving the bearing of arms, than the 10th Amendment, reflecting a states’-rights movement that is picking up steam across the country.

“The short-term practical effect will be nil,” Kevin R.C. Gutzman, who teaches history at Western Connecticut State University and supports the states’-rights movement, said of Tennessee’s federal-exemption bill. “But in the long term, or medium term, it’s having the effect of provoking a conversation about the allocation of powers between the federal and state governments.”

The measure, called the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act, says that firearms and ammunition made and sold within the state, and stamped “Made in Tennessee,” are beyond the jurisdiction of the federal government. The theory is that if firearms are not sold across state lines they cannot be considered part of interstate commerce and are therefore exempt from federal regulations.

Those regulations cover things like documentation on the sale and shipment of firearms. They also bar possession by certain people, like felons and the mentally ill. Gun owners would still be subject to state laws.

Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, who vetoed the guns-in-bars bill but was overridden, said in a statement late Friday that he would allow the exemption bill to become law without his signature. The bill “represents a fringe constitutional theory” that will be thrown out of court, Mr. Bredesen said, but letting it become law may speed that challenge and yield clarity sooner. He said that in the meantime, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would enforce federal regulations, and he predicted confusion for gun makers, dealers and importers.

Gun-control advocates say these efforts to exempt states from federal gun laws will have a limited effect because few federal laws exist anyway. Those that do exist, said Daniel Vice, senior lawyer at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, involve background checks and what he called “basic record-keeping.” But evading any federal laws, Mr. Vice added, could make it easier for criminals to get guns.

Whatever the practical result of Tennessee’s new gun laws, they may well serve a political purpose: firing up the conservative base before next year’s state, local and Congressional elections.

“The Republicans are trying to embarrass the Democrats,” said John G. Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.

“They want to put these proposals on the table not only because they believe in guns, but they want to force the Democrats to come out as anti-gun,” Professor Geer said. “You can see the attack ads forming already. The Republicans have won this issue.”
520 2009-06-16 WASHINGTON  President Obama went before a convention of receptive but wary doctors on Monday to make the economic case for a health care overhaul, both for the nation and for the physicians’ own bottom lines.

But as the president spoke at the annual conference of the American Medical Association in Chicago, it became clear that one of the major health plans on the table would cost at least $1 trillion over 10 years yet leave tens of millions of people uninsured.

Congress is wrestling with how to pay for Mr. Obama’s vision to extend health care to all Americans, and some lawmakers are considering tax increases and spending cuts different from the ones he has proposed. House Democrats, for example, are weighing a tax on soft drinks and a value-added tax, a broad-based consumption tax similar to the sales taxes many states levy.

An analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office raised the hurdles for draft legislation in the Senate just as its Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee planned to begin voting on Wednesday. The office concluded that a plan by the committee’s Democratic leaders, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, would reduce the number of uninsured only by a net 16 million people. Even if the bill became law, the budget office said, 36 million people would remain uninsured in 2017.

That finding came as a surprise. Robert D. Reischauer, an economist who headed the budget office when Congress tackled the health care issue in the Clinton administration, said that if so many people remained uninsured, it might not be feasible to cut special federal payments to hospitals that serve many low-income people.

Mr. Obama said Saturday that the government could save $106 billion over 10 years by cutting such hospital payments as more people gained coverage.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a senior Republican on both committees drafting health legislation, said he found the office’s numbers stunning. He calculated that the Kennedy bill would cost taxpayers $62,500 per uninsured person over the 10 years.

Mr. Obama took the cost issue head on in Chicago. “The cost of inaction is greater,” he told the doctors, because rising health care prices are “an escalating burden on our families and businesses” and “a ticking time bomb for the federal budget.”

Opening a week in which health care will dominate attention in Congress, the president’s speech on Monday was the latest example of an oft-used ploy to press his case: appearing before skeptical audiences, confident of his powers of persuasion but willing as well to say what his listeners do not want to hear.

Mr. Obama spoke just days after the A.M.A. had signaled opposition to his proposal for a public health insurance plan to compete with private insurers as part of a menu of choices, much like the one for members of Congress.

“The public option is not your enemy,” Mr. Obama said. “It is your friend, I believe.” Saying it would “keep the insurance companies honest,” the president dismissed as “illegitimate” the claims of critics that a public insurance option amounts to “a Trojan horse for a single-payer system” run by the government.

Mr. Obama twice referred to the use of such “fear tactics” about “socialized medicine” in past legislative battles, without pointing out that the A.M.A., a traditionally Republican-leaning group, was among those using the charge, as in the mid-1960s debate over creating Medicare for people 65 and older.

Mr. Obama drew repeated applause, and even some standing ovations, when he called for incentives to get more medical students to go into primary care instead of the more lucrative specialty practices, and when he pledged to work with doctors to reduce their often unnecessary “defensive medicine” to avoid malpractice lawsuits. But scattered boos met his follow-up remark that he opposed any cap on malpractice awards.

The president’s emphasis on reducing health care costs over expanding insurance coverage, which dates to his campaign, reverses Democrats’ priorities of recent years. Obama advisers say the focus on cost savings has appeal for all Americans, not just the uninsured. Some advisers, including veterans of the Clinton administration, say President Bill Clinton’s emphasis on covering the uninsured helped doom his health care plan in 1994.

“We have made cost control a coequal objective, just as important as the expansion of insurance coverage, which has traditionally been the dominant goal for Democrats,” said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. “The entire discussion has to be centered on controlling or reducing costs.”

That rationale has been Mr. Obama’s answer to those who, after his election, predicted that he would have to shelve his campaign promise to overhaul health care to attend instead to an economy in crisis. “If we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans, all of which will affect your practice,” he told the A.M.A. members.

The practical problem for Mr. Obama is that by all accounts, the savings and efficiencies he envisions will not occur quickly, certainly not in the 10-year time frame of budget scorekeeping for purposes of passing legislation.

The budget office estimated that 39 million people would get coverage through new “insurance exchanges.” But at the same time, it said, the number of people with employer-provided health insurance would decline by 15 million, or about 10 percent, and coverage from other sources would fall by 8 million.

In effect, the office said, millions of people would get a better deal if they bought insurance through an exchange because they could qualify for federal subsidies not available if they stayed in their employers’ health plans. Subsidies are expected to average $5,000 to $6,000 a person.

Mr. Obama assured skeptics in the audience: “You did not enter this profession to be bean counters and paper pushers. You entered this profession to be healers. And that’s what our health care system should let you be.”

On Wednesday, leaders of the Senate Finance Committee hope to unveil what will be the one bipartisan measure in Congress.

Democrats on three House panels continue to meet privately to seek consensus on a single plan. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee said they were trying to decide whether to finance coverage of the uninsured with one broad-based tax, like the value-added tax, or a combination of smaller taxes.

The value-added tax, common in other countries, is collected in stages from each business that contributes to the production and sale of consumer goods. Economists say a 5 percent VAT could have raised $285 billion last year.

But a VAT could violate Mr. Obama’s campaign pledge not to raise taxes on households with incomes under $250,000 a year.
521 2009-06-16 Georgian leaders say the mission should remain the “United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia.” But Russia, and separatist authorities, say they will not allow the mission to remain unless its name and its mandate are changed to reflect Abkhazia’s independence from Georgia.

Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s envoy to the United Nations, said a draft resolution offered by Western members was “blatantly unacceptable” and “political poison,” because it contained references to the “U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia” and commitments to Georgia’s territorial integrity.

“It was beyond anybody’s imagination that it could be accepted by the Russian Federation and Abkhazia,” Mr. Churkin said, according to a transcript from the Federal News Service Inc.

United Nations officials have made it clear that they want to continue their work. Johan C. Verbeke, the special representative who leads the mission, told Reuters that its removal would “basically leave the population on their own.”

As officials tried to seek a middle ground, Georgia made its dissatisfaction clear. The most recent report on Abkhazia from the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, released in May, does not refer to “Abkhazia, Georgia” as previous reports did, but instead mentions only “the Mission” rather than the “Mission in Georgia.”

Alexander Lomaia, Georgia’s ambassador to the United Nations, reacted angrily, saying, “It is very unfortunate and alarming that the Secretariat has submitted to Russian blackmail.” Mr. Ban “categorically rejected” Mr. Lomaia’s claim in a statement released the next day, saying his wording “reflected his view of what all members could live with.”

Georgians, including many who fled their homes in Abkhazia in the early 1990s, followed news of the Council’s vote, worried that new language would open the door to Abkhaz independence. Outside the United Nations office in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where several dozen demonstrators gathered, Ada Marshania said she planned to pelt the office with eggs if the organization “dares to keep this title that Abkhazia is not a part of Georgia.” Rusudan Lobjanidze, 60, stood and wept silently.

“If they declare Abkhazia independent today, we will never return,” Ms. Lobjanidze said. “My 90-year-old mother asks, every morning, to be buried in her homeland.”

On a separate front, Tbilisi was jolted by violence again on Monday when police officers used clubs to disperse a crowd of about 100 anti-government demonstrators, arresting 39. Officers also attacked journalists and seized their equipment.

Eka Zguladze, Georgia’s deputy interior minister, said the protesters were blocking the entrance of Tbilisi’s central police station, and officers had identified some as activists who had thrown eggs at members of Parliament last week.She apologized for injuries to journalists and said the police should not have taken away their cameras.

“This is our mistake, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs wants to acknowledge it,” Ms. Zguladze said. “It is our duty to protect the right of journalists to work.”

Diplomats from France, the United Kingdom and the United States condemned protesters’ attacks on members of Parliament, which occurred last Friday. The United States Embassy released a statement, saying their actions “crossed a line from free expression of opinion to criminal activity.” Opposition leaders said foreign diplomats should not involve themselves in internal politics.

“This is considered as interference in domestic political processes, which they are not entitled to do,” said Salome Zurabishvili, Georgia’s former foreign minister and the leader of the Georgia’s Way Party, according to the Interfax news agency.
522 2009-06-16 Extended Stay Hotels, the operator of midprice hotels acquired at the peak of the commercial real estate market for $8 billion, filed for bankruptcy protection, hurt by the cutbacks in corporate and leisure travel during the recession.

Extended Stay Hotels, a chain based in Spartanburg, S.C., has more than 680 properties in 44 states. It collapsed two years after Lightstone Group, a real estate firm based in Lakewood, N.J., bought it with $7.4 billion in financing.

The chain said it had $7.1 billion in assets and $7.6 billion in debts at the end of last year, according to papers filed today in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York.

Lightstone bought the chain from the private equity firm Blackstone Group in April 2007 in its first purchase in the lodging business. Since then, prices have declined nationwide.

The hotel industry is enduring its “weakest year on record,” according to PKF Hospitality Research, a research firm based in Atlanta. Hotel occupancy in the United States fell 14 percent in the week ended June 6 from a year earlier and average daily room rates were down 11 percent, to $95.90, according to data from Smith Travel Service.

Blackstone had bought Extended Stay in 2004, when it had 425 hotels, for $2 billion and the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt. It added properties through acquisitions.

536 2009-06-17 In the meantime, Mr. Kemery suggested that pet owners read the directions on any veterinary medicine they use. “Don’t use dog products on cats and vice versa,” he added. “If you detect negative reactions, the vet is the first stop.”

Most of the spot-on products are intended for dogs only, but there are more than 25 labeled for cats and at least two for use on both cats and ferrets.

Cats are particularly sensitive to an insecticide called permethrin, the active ingredient in some spot-on flea and tick treatments. According to a study published online in The Veterinary Journal, cats overdosed with permethrin insecticides can suffer tremors, seizures, excess salivation, vomiting, loss of appetite and death. Steven R. Hansen, a veterinary toxicologist with the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, said there have been cases in which a cat has been poisoned by grooming a dog that had been treated with a permethrin pesticide, but such events, he said, are "extremely rare."

Not all pet pesticides contain permethrin. Bob Walker, a spokesman for Bayer, which manufactures Advantage and Advantix flea and tick products, said that some of the company’s dog medicines contain permethrin but its cat medicines do not.

The appearance of counterfeit pesticide products for dogs and cats has further complicated the picture. On April 28, the E.P.A. warned distributors and retailers to stop selling counterfeit products with the brand names Advantage and Frontline, and to recall those already sold.

It is unclear why reports of adverse reactions have increased in recent years. Natasha Joseph, a spokeswoman for Mariel, the manufacturer of Frontline flea and tick treatments, suggested that the appearance of new products on the market or improved reporting might help explain the increase.

“We reported to the E.P.A. that events for Frontline have been consistently low,” she said. “Frontline is not part of the problem.” Frontline products for both dogs and cats contain a broad-spectrum pesticide called fipronil.

A list of more than 200 brand names of registered spot-on repellents was updated on May 15 and appears on the E.P.A. Web site (PDF). Consumers may call the National Pesticide Information Center at (800) 858-7378 to report a problem with the products.

The agency has also advised veterinarians to report adverse reactions at the center’s Veterinary Pesticide Adverse Effects reporting portal.

Ultimately, the E.P.A. analysis may lead to changes in regulations. “It could be that we’ll require changes in labeling or formulaic changes,” Mr. Kemery said. “And it could go as far as canceling a product.”

548 2009-06-17 We’re sorry, we seem to have lost this page, but we don’t want to lose you.
549 2009-06-17 We spend billions of dollars on operations, tests and drugs that haven’t been proved to make people healthier. Yet we have not spent the money to install computerized medical records — and we suffer more medical errors than many other countries.

We underpay primary care doctors, relative to specialists, and they keep us stewing in waiting rooms while they try to see as many patients as possible. We don’t reimburse different specialists for time spent collaborating with one another, and many hard-to-diagnose conditions go untreated. We don’t pay nurses to counsel people on how to improve their diets or remember to take their pills, and manageable cases of and heart disease become fatal.

“Just because there isn’t some government agency specifically telling you which treatments you can have based on cost-effectiveness,” as Dr. Mark McClellan, head of in the Bush administration, says, “that doesn’t mean you aren’t getting some treatments.”

’s beloved line is a good way to frame the issue: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The choice isn’t between rationing and not rationing. It’s between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to health care than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it’s hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan panel led by four former Senate majority leaders — Howard Baker, , and George Mitchell — will release a solid proposal for . Among other things, it would call on the federal government to do more research on which treatments actually work. An “independent health care council” would also be established, charged with helping the government avoid unnecessary health costs. The Obama administration supports a similar approach.

And connecting the dots is easy enough. Armed with better information, Medicare could pay more for effective treatments — and no longer pay quite so much for health care that doesn’t make people healthier.

Mr. Baker, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell: I accuse you of rationing.

There are three main ways that the health care system already imposes rationing on us. The first is the most counterintuitive, because it doesn’t involve denying medical care. It involves denying just about everything else.

The rapid rise in medical costs has put many employers in a tough spot. They have had to pay much higher premiums, which have increased their labor costs. To make up for these increases, many have given meager pay raises.

This tradeoff is often explicit during contract negotiations between a company and a labor union. For nonunionized workers, the tradeoff tends to be invisible. It happens behind closed doors in the human resources department. But it still happens.

Research by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra of Harvard has found that, on average, a 10 percent increase in health premiums leads to a 2.3 percent decline in inflation-adjusted pay. Victor Fuchs, a Stanford economist, and , an oncologist now in the Obama administration, published an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association last year that nicely captured the tradeoff. When health costs have grown fastest over the last two decades, they wrote, wages have grown slowest, and vice versa.

So when middle-class families complain about being stretched thin, they’re really complaining about rationing. Our expensive, inefficient health care system is eating up money that could otherwise pay for a , a car, a vacation or college tuition.

The second kind of rationing involves the uninsured. The high cost of care means that some employers can’t afford to offer and still pay a competitive wage. Those high costs mean that individuals can’t buy insurance on their own.

The uninsured still receive some health care, obviously. But they get less care, and worse care, than they need. The has estimated that 18,000 people died in 2000 because they lacked insurance. By 2006, the number had risen to 22,000, according to the Urban Institute.

The final form of rationing is the one I described near the beginning of this column: the failure to provide certain types of care, even to people with health insurance. Doctors are generally not paid to do the blocking and tackling of medicine: collaboration, probing conversations with patients, small steps that avoid medical errors. Many doctors still do such things, out of professional pride. But the full medical system doesn’t do nearly enough.

That’s rationing — and it has real consequences.

In , 81 percent of primary care doctors have set up a way for their patients to get after-hours care, according to the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States, only 40 percent have. Over all, the survival rates for many diseases in this country are no better than they are in countries that spend far less on health care. People here are less likely to have long-term survival after , childhood leukemia or a than they are in Canada — that bastion of rationing.

None of this means that reducing health costs will be easy. The comparative-effectiveness research favored by the former Senate majority leaders and the White House has inspired opposition from some doctors, members of Congress and patient groups. Certainly, the critics are right to demand that the research be done carefully. It should examine different forms of a disease and, ideally, various subpopulations who have the disease. Just as important, scientists — not political appointees or Congress — should be in charge of the research.

But flat-out opposition to comparative effectiveness is, in the end, opposition to making good choices. And all the noise about rationing is not really a courageous stand against less medical care. It’s a utopian stand against better medical care.
550 2009-06-17 Imperial Sugar has restarted its refinery in Port Wentworth to resume making crystal sugar for the first time since a deadly explosion devastated the plant last year. The factory’s 350 workers have been clearing debris, repainting buildings and cleaning equipment since the Feb. 7, 2008, explosion, which killed 14 workers. Investigators say the blast was caused by accumulated sugar dust that ignited.
551 2009-06-17 The managing director of a collapsed Chicago hedge fund, Lake Shore Asset Management, was indicted by a federal grand jury. Prosecutors say the director, Philip J. Baker, operated a $300 million fraud.

The 27-count indictment was unsealed on Monday, said Patrick J. Fitzgerald, a United States attorney, in a statement on Tuesday. An arrest warrant has been issued for Mr. Baker, but his whereabouts are unknown, Mr. Fitzgerald said.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Mr. Baker in a civil lawsuit last year of having defrauded at least 700 investors by hiding trading losses. The commission won court orders banning Lake Shore from commodities trading.

Mr. Baker said that Lake Shore had a long history of trading success, though it lost about $38 million from 2002 to 2007, according to the indictment.

Mr. Baker did not appear in court during the commodities case.

James A. McGurk, a lawyer who represented Lake Shore in that case, said he had not seen the indictment and could not comment on it.

If convicted, Mr. Baker, 44, faces up to 20 years in prison on charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice, and five years on allegations of commodities fraud and embezzlement of commodity pool funds, Mr. Fitzgerald said.
552 2009-06-17 A Kansas City group whose effort to recall Mayor Mark Funkhouser failed by 129 signatures last month said it was giving up its fight because of money. The city clerk, Vickie Thompson, ruled that the petitioners had fallen just short of the 16,950 valid signatures of registered voters that were required for a recall election.
553 2009-06-17 Two lawyers who worked at the London offices of American law firms were charged with insider trading on Tuesday by a British regulator.

Andrew Rimmington, a former corporate partner at Dorsey & Whitney, and Michael Gerard McFall, an ex-corporate partner at McDermott Will & Emery, appeared at a magistrates court in London and were charged by the Financial Services Authority with insider trading, the regulator said in a statement.

Peter King, a former director of NeuTec Pharma, was also charged at the hearing.

The criminal prosecution relates to a takeover of NeuTec by the drug maker Novartis in 2006, according to court documents.

It is the fifth criminal insider-trading case prosecuted since January 2008 by the regulator.

Mr. King is accused of disclosing inside information to Mr. McFall, the statement said.

Mr. McFall is charged with giving the information to Mr. Rimmington and buying almost 4,000 NeuTec shares based on the information.

Mr. Rimmington is accused of buying almost 7,000 shares in the company.

A lawyer for Mr. Rimmington, Ian Mason, said in a statement that his client rejected the allegations made by the regulator and “looks forward to being in a position to establish his innocence and clear his name.”

Sarah Wallace, Mr. King’s lawyer, said, “Mr. King strenuously denies the allegation and denies any wrongdoing, and he believes the case against him is fundamentally flawed and wishes to clear his name as soon as possible.”
554 2009-06-17 WASHINGTON  President Obama’s plan to reshape financial regulation, which he will unveil on Wednesday, is the product of weeks of meetings among government officials, financial experts, lawmakers, industry executives and lobbyists, many of whom were invited to help the White House draft the proposal.

Mr. Obama told reporters on Tuesday that a “lack of oversight” allowed what he called “wild risk-taking.” He said it led to “very dangerous” conditions that imperiled the global economy.

But executives from an array of industries caught up in the financial crisis came to Washington over the last several weeks to make their case for how the new regulatory landscape should look. They came from big banks and small ones, insurance companies and stock exchanges, hedge funds and mutual funds, and were joined by officials from consumer groups and big labor  often with conflicting views.

Now, lobbyists who lost the initial skirmish inside the administration will head to Congress to try to influence the final product.

The plan the president will formally announce on Wednesday would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. It would separately expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seize and break up troubled financial institutions. And it would create a council of regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to fill in regulatory gaps.

In doing so, the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has grown up outside the government’s purview, and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large, troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail.

“Unfortunately the growth of the nonbank sector as well as all the complexities and financial instruments outstripped those old regulatory regimes,” Mr. Obama said in an interview on Tuesday with The New York Times and CNBC.

Although it would strikingly reorganize the regulatory architecture, the president’s plan results from many compromises with industry executives and lawmakers, and is not as bold as some had hoped.

Mr. Obama seemed to acknowledge as much when he posed the question: “Did, you know, any considerations of sort of politics play into it? We want to get this thing passed, and, you know, we think that speed is important. We want to do it right. We want to do it carefully. But we don’t want to tilt at windmills.”

At the White House and the Treasury Department in recent weeks, some insurance companies sought a law that would enable them to get a single federal charter instead of multiple state charters. The insurers lost. Consumer groups argued against the banks in favor of a consumer financial protection agency with broad new authority to protect homeowners from unsuitable loans. The consumer groups prevailed.

The mutual fund industry successfully argued against a proposal by some banks  which are competitors to mutual funds  to give the Securities and Exchange Commission’s authority over mutual funds to the new consumer agency.

Hedge funds and dealers in derivatives sought to minimize the extent to which the government will intrude into their businesses. They partly won; the administration will leave many of the details of that authority to lawmakers and regulators. Savings and loan associations argued unsuccessfully against a proposal by the administration to eliminate federal savings and loan charters, which have been subject to less regulation than bank charters.

The administration, which has sought to reduce the corrosive influence of lobbying on policy making, actually encouraged the tussle by inviting executives, academics, former officials and others to the series of meetings overseen by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and Lawrence H. Summers, the president’s top economic adviser. The meetings were often attended by their top aides: the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, and Diana Farrell, a deputy director of the National Economic Council at the White House.

In the last two weeks alone, the administration has heard from top executives from Goldman Sachs, MetLife, Allstate, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Travelers, Prudential and Wells Fargo, among others. Administration officials also discussed the president’s plan with the top lobbyists at major financial trade associations in Washington.

The raucous process of overhauling a system that oversees the nation’s most influential and affluent corporate interests is not without precedent. In 1913, the year he signed the law creating the Federal Reserve in response to an earlier market panic, President Woodrow Wilson lamented to a friend about banking reform.

“There are almost as many judgments as there are men,” Mr. Wilson said. “To form a single plan and a single intention about it at times seems a task so various and so elusive that it is hard to keep one’s heart from failing.”

President Obama’s plan would not consolidate all the banking agencies into one, but it would take some of the existing agencies’ powers to oversee mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of consumer debt and give them to a new regulator, tentatively called the Consumer Financial Protection Agency.

The president, however, will ask Congress to merge the Office of Thrift Supervision, the beleaguered agency that missed problems at IndyMac, Washington Mutual and the American International Group, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Treasury unit that supervises the largest banks.

The plan would impose tighter rules on banks that package and sell securities that are backed by mortgages and other debt. It would require that companies that issue mortgages retain at least 5 percent of them on their books to discourage companies from marketing unsuitable loans.

It would also require all advisers of hedge funds and private equity funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and open their books to regulators. And it would impose new conflict of interest rules on the credit rating agencies.

The plan is largely the product of extensive conversations between senior administration officials and top Democratic lawmakers  primarily Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. The two lawmakers head the Congressional committees that will take the first crack at drafting the legislation necessary to make the plan work.
555 2009-06-17 Others said the new analysis was unjustifiably dismissive. “What is needed is not less research into gene-environment interaction,” Avshalom Caspi, a neuroscientist at and lead author of the original paper, wrote in an e-mail message, “but more research of better quality.”

The original study was so compelling because it explained how nature and nurture could collude to produce a complex mood problem. It followed 847 people from birth to age 26 and found that those most likely to sink into depression after a stressful event — job loss, sexual abuse, bankruptcy — had a particular variant of a gene involved in the regulation of serotonin, a brain messenger that affects mood. Those in the study with another variant of the gene were significantly more resilient.

“I think what happened is that people who’d been working in this field for so long were desperate to have any solid finding,” Kathleen R. Merikangas, chief of the genetic epidemiology research branch of the National Institute of Mental Health and senior author of the new analysis, said in a phone interview. “It was exciting, and some people thought it was the finding in psychiatry, a major advance.”

The excitement spread quickly. Newspapers and magazines reported the finding. Columnists, commentators and op-ed writers emphasized its importance. The study provided some despairing patients with comfort, and an excuse — “Well, it is in my genes.” It reassured some doctors that they were medicating an organic disorder, and stirred interest in genetic testing for depression risk.

Since then, researchers have tried to replicate the gene finding in more than a dozen studies. Some found similar results; others did not. In the new study, being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Neil Risch of the University of California, San Francisco, and Dr. Merikangas led a coalition of researchers who identified 14 studies that gathered the same kinds of data as the original study. The authors reanalyzed the data and found “no evidence of an association between the serotonin gene and the risk of depression,” no matter what people’s life experience was, Dr. Merikangas said.

By contrast, she said, a major stressful event, like divorce, in itself raised the risk of depression by 40 percent.

The authors conclude that the widespread acceptance of the original findings was premature, writing that “it is critical that health practitioners and scientists in other disciplines recognize the importance of replication of such findings before they can serve as valid indicators of disease risk” or otherwise change practice.

Dr. Caspi and other psychiatric researchers said it would be equally premature to abandon research into gene-environment interaction, when brain imaging and other kinds of evidence have linked the serotonin gene to sensitivity.

“This is an excellent review paper, no one is questioning that,” said Myrna Weissman, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia. “But it ignored extensive evidence from humans and animals linking excessive sensitivity to stress” to the serotonin gene.

Dr. Merikangas said she and her co-authors deliberately confined themselves to studies that could be directly compared to the original. “We were looking for replication,” she said.
556 2009-06-17 The Genzyme Corporation said on Tuesday that it might ration a limited supply of two drugs that treat rare diseases while it decontaminated the factory where they were made.

Contamination with a virus called Vesivirus 2117 has disrupted production and the plant will be closed for cleaning, said Henri A. Termeer, Genzyme’s chief executive.

The shutdown of the plant, Allston Landing in Boston, will cause a shortage in August of Cerezyme, a drug that treats Gaucher disease, in which harmful levels of a fatty substance accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs and brain. The company also expects a reduced supply of Fabrazyme, which treats Fabry disease, in September and October, Mr. Termeer said. Fabry disease, in which lipids build up to harmful levels in the eyes, kidneys, nervous system and cardiovascular system, affects 5,000 to 10,000 people.

Genzyme said it would work with regulators, doctors and patient groups to manage distribution of supplies.
557 2009-06-17 “Small schools have really made remarkable gains for thousands of kids, but there’s a price, and the price is a lot of the large schools have gotten worse,” said Clara Hemphill, an author of the New School report, who is known for her guidebooks on the city’s best public schools.

The city’s Department of Education disputed several of the report’s findings, saying decreases in graduation and attendance rates at large high schools could not be linked to the creation of small schools.

Melody Meyer, a spokeswoman for the department, noted that demographic changes alone could account for an influx of 15,000 high school students from 2002 to 2005, and that graduation rates had improved citywide over the past seven years.

In an interview with the researchers, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein defended his small-schools strategy, saying that even if schools were burdened with high-risk students, it was better than leaving those students in failing schools.

“There were some growth pains,” he said. “The process is not over.”

Stephen M. Duch, principal of Hillcrest High School in Queens, which serves 3,200 students, said that his school had instituted small learning environments — with themes like pre-med, theater and health careers — partially in response to an infusion of higher-needs students after the opening of small schools in the area.

“Given the deflection of students, it was even more paramount to change the way we ran the school,” he said. “You bring over 3,000 kids into a building of 200 teachers, and it can be very anonymous. Students could fall through the cracks.”

One point of agreement between the city and the researchers was the looming challenge posed by a state mandate to impose more rigorous graduation standards, which affects this year’s ninth graders. The report noted that a disproportionately high number of students at small high schools might have difficulty satisfying requirements for the more rigorous state Regents diplomas that will soon be required.

The City Council’s Education Committee is expected to discuss the new graduation requirements on Thursday.

The report expressed caution about the future of small schools, which boast an average class size of 27, compared with 34 citywide. It found high rates of principal and teacher turnover at the schools, and said that attendance and graduation rates had declined each year at many of the schools that opened since 2002, though they still outperformed the schools they replaced.

“It’s partly that they burn very hot and fast,” Ms. Hemphill said. “They start out with a huge level of enthusiasm among teachers and staff, but it’s really, really hard work, and after a certain number of years of 80-hour workweeks, the teachers get tired.”

Critics of small schools have argued that much of their success can be attributed to the fact that they serve populations markedly different from the failing schools they replace. The New School report, however, indicated that while disparities had existed in the past, most small schools matched citywide averages in the number of students who were from low-income families, were in special education programs or were struggling with English.
558 2009-06-17 The new cases are fallout from last year’s Supreme Court case, District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down parts of Washington’s gun control ordinance, the strictest in the country, and stated for the first time that the Second Amendment gives individuals a right to keep and bear arms for personal use. But the court declined to say whether the Second Amendment in general applies to state and local governments.

In January, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, in a ruling joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, declined to apply the Second Amendment to a New York law that banned the martial arts device known as chuka sticks, or nunchaku. The ban was allowed to stay in place.

Then in April, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that the Second Amendment did apply to the states, even though it allowed a California county to ban guns on government property like state fairgrounds. That case, Nordyke v. King, is being considered for a rehearing by the full Ninth Circuit.

Those two conflicting cases set the stage for two other cases that were heard as one in the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, testing that city’s handgun ban. On June 2, a three-judge panel of the court, led by Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, a well-known conservative, ruled that there was no basis for the court to apply the Second Amendment to the states. Such a decision, Judge Easterbrook wrote, should be made only by the Supreme Court, not at the appellate level.

The right of states to make their own decisions on such matters, Judge Easterbrook wrote, “is an older and more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry any particular kind of weapon.”

The lawyers for the plaintiffs, including the National Rifle Association, have asked the Supreme Court to take up the Chicago cases.

A split among the federal appeals circuits, especially on constitutional issues, invites Supreme Court action, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Californians, Hawaiians and Oregonians have a Second Amendment right to bear arms, but New Yorkers, Illinoisans, and Wisconsinites don’t,” Professor Winkler said. “The Supreme Court will want to correct this sooner rather than later.”

The process of applying amendments of the Bill of Rights to the states, known as incorporation, began after the Civil War but had its heyday in the activist Supreme Court of the Earl Warren era. Much of the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment’s freedom of speech and some rights of criminal defendants, have been applied to the states, but other elements have not, including the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial and the Second Amendment.

Incorporation fell out of favor after the 1960s, but a new generation of largely liberal scholars of law and history have brought it back into the intellectual mainstream, said Akhil Reed Amar, a law professor at Yale University, who supports the process.

“The precedents are now supportive of incorporation of nearly every provision of the Bill of Rights,” Professor Amar said. “Now what’s odd is that the Second Amendment doesn’t apply to the states.”

Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, said he would be surprised if the Supreme Court accepted these gun cases, because some of the conservative justices on the court had scoffed at incorporation arguments in the past and might not want to set a precedent.

Professor Amar, however, argued that the justices would not only take up the case but would also ultimately vote for incorporation of the Second Amendment.

Even if the Second Amendment becomes the controlling law of every state and town, constitutional scholars say it is still unlikely that gun laws would be overturned wholesale. The Supreme Court’s Heller decision last year, notes Nelson Lund, a law professor at George Mason University, “clearly indicates that governments will still have wide latitude to regulate firearms.”

Even the Ninth Circuit in California, while applying the Second Amendment to the states, still upheld the gun ordinance that gave rise to the lawsuit.

Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the view of the Ninth Circuit reflected what polls have said was, by and large, the view of the American people.

“There is a right to bear arms,” Professor Volokh said, “but it’s not absolute.”
559 2009-06-17 Woods does not need to spell out that seven years ago, with the extroverted New York crowd adopting Phil Mickelson as its Southern California homeboy, he beat Mickelson by three strokes on Bethpage Black. Now he is back, coming off a victory in Ohio two weeks ago. But then again, he is often coming off a victory, somewhere.

He is asked about Michael Jordan’s having shot an 86 last Friday on this most demanding of public courses:

“It’s a pretty impressive score, considering his start,” Woods says. “I mean, he tripled one and doubled the next three holes and still turned around and shot a good number. Especially the back nine, he really played well.

“So it goes to show you that just like all athletes or entertainers, they’re used to performing in front of crowds. So once you put a little bit of pressure on them, it’s amazing how well they perform.”

He brightens, talking about somebody he accepts as an equal. He makes commercials with Derek Jeter and Roger Federer, and has sat in Federer’s box at the United States Open of tennis. They are his peers; the blokes here at the Open are his competitors.

A bit later, Woods gives his theory about why courses keep getting enlarged: “If you look at it, guys are getting bigger and stronger. People forget that. When Jack and Gary and Arnold played, and Hogan, they’re all about 5-9. I’m 6 foot and I’m the shortest guy in the top players of the world.”

Reminded how he won the Open last year with a broken bone in his leg, badly needing A.C.L. replacement, he explains why he opted for surgery: “Yeah, I could have played the British but I would have had to let my leg heal. It was broken. I would probably rebreak it again during the British.” Or, he might have won the British on a broken leg.

With Father’s Day coming up, somebody asks how often he thinks about his late father, Earl. “Well, probably every time I play,” Woods answers. “I always think about Dad, and especially when I take the time off and I come back and I start playing again. All my practice sessions, I’ll go back to the old fundamentals I learned from Dad.”

Now he is asked about Amy Mickelson, who will begin treatment for breast cancer on July 1, and how this will affect her husband in this Open.

“Is it easy? No, it’s not easy,” Woods says. “When my dad was sick, that’s kind of the natural progression anyways. Your parents are supposed to pass away before you. And God forbid how they get sick or how it ends.”

He shudders at the idea of serious illness striking a spouse.

“And you think the golf course would be your escape, but it’s not. You’re surrounded by people wishing you well the entire time and hope everything works out. But then again, they keep reminding you of the same circumstance you’re dealing with on a daily basis, and you just can’t get away from it.”

He adds that Amy Mickelson is “a sweetheart” and he talks about the table tennis doubles matches the Mickelson and Woods families have played at Ryder Cup events. “Those are priceless times.”

Who is the best golfer in the world? “Jack.”

How close are you? “He’s got 18, I’m at 14,” a reference to the number of majors he and Nicklaus have won.

After nearly half an hour, Woods is ready for some levity. Asked about plans to hold the 2014 men’s and women’s Opens back to back at Pinehurst, and whether somebody might play both, Woods replies: “I need to have a sex change. Is that what you’re saying?”

Actually, the question was about whether a woman might try to play the men’s tournament, and Woods notes they have the right.

Then he is excused, out the side door, no extra tidbits of conversation at the steel stanchions. The Open begins Thursday. Tiger has 14; Nicklaus has 18. Tiger Woods is waiting.
560 2009-06-17 Hundreds of protesters called for Premier Ewart F. Brown to step down on Tuesday, accusing him of acting like a dictator in secretly accepting four prisoners from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Some 600 people gathered outside Parliament in the capital, Hamilton, waving banners and chanting “Brown must go.” Mr. Brown, left, dismissed the protest as “nothing new.” The four prisoners, Uighur Muslims from China, had been determined by the United States not to be enemy combatants and were released last week.
561 2009-06-17 A government commission investigating human rights abuses during the war with the Tamil Tiger rebels has been disbanded with more than half of the cases unresolved, an official said Tuesday. A presidential commission of inquiry was established two years ago to investigate earlier claims of abuses in the war, which ended last month. It was assigned 16 cases of abuses alleged by both sides. Nissanka Kumara Udalagama, the commission chairman, said it had completed work on seven of the cases by the time its mandate expired Sunday. The government has also rejected demands for an international investigation into the final battles of the war, in which the United Nations says more than 7,000 civilians were killed.
562 2009-06-17 To the naked eye, counter)induction looks like a straightforward new-music chamber ensemble, a peculiarly constituted quartet (violinist, violist, cellist and clarinetist) that takes in guest players as needed. But it also includes three nonperforming composers, and it describes itself as a “composer-performer collective.”

All three resident composers — Douglas Boyce, Kyle Bartlett and Ryan Streber — were represented in the ensemble’s 10th-anniversary program on Monday evening at Merkin Concert Hall. But counter)induction is hardly a closed shop: it holds a biennial composers’ competition, and a work by one of its winners, Carl Schimmel, was included, as were a piece commissioned for the occasion from Eric Moe and older works by Lee Hyla and Salvatore Sciarrino.

Mr. Streber’s contribution, “Partita” (2007), for solo cello, is couched in a single, continuous movement, with changes in tempo and spirit that suggest a sequence of short dances, like those of a Baroque partita. Not that Mr. Streber’s musical language or the shapes of those sections refer overtly to Baroque conventions or dance forms. Tempo and character are varied, but what changes most from section to section is the music’s inner tensions.

Sumire Kudo, the group’s cellist (and a member of the New York Philharmonic) moved with ease and assurance through its flighty passages and with a magnetic solemnity in its slower ones.

Mr. Boyce composed “Deixo|Sonata” (2009) for the ensemble’s violist, Jessica Meyer, supported here by the pianist Steven Beck. It is an unabashed showpiece, if a brainy one, that pays homage to the traditional sonata layout: the outer movements are hard-driven and sharply rhythmic, and have an acerbic modernist edge, and the central slow movement is built on an arching theme, with sighing, descending slides. Ms. Meyer and Mr. Beck played the piece with the kind of polish, focus and excitement that you would expect in a firmly settled repertory piece.
563 2009-06-17 Mr. Wells told the jury that Mr. Greenberg acted because he was angry about having been “kicked out of A.I.G.” in 2005. Within weeks, Mr. Wells said, Mr. Greenberg sent a corporate jet from Bermuda, where Starr International has its main offices, to New York, to retrieve the stock.

Time and again during Tuesday’s testimony, Mr. Greenberg was presented with his own words about the trust, and challenged on why they seemed to conflict with the facts.

But again and again, Mr. Greenberg rebutted the accusations, saying his accusers were taking snippets of his speeches or quoting old documents out of context.

Jurors watched videotapes, for example, of Mr. Greenberg’s speeches to top managers, in which he told them the plan had been funded so generously it might never run out of shares. That seemed to suggest that the retirement plan would be in place indefinitely, Mr. Wells said. But Mr. Greenberg said that he often gave speeches extemporaneously, and no one would expect them to lay out every aspect of the retirement plan, like legal documents.

“This was a motivating speech,” he said. “This was an overview. It was not intended to give you every detail.”

Mr. Greenberg was also asked about a letter he wrote to a reporter at Fortune magazine in 1998, after she wrote an article describing A.I.G. as being owned by “a shadowy offshore company.” Mr. Greenberg said he felt compelled to clarify the purposes of Starr International, or SICO.

“You wrote that the voting shareholders of SICO were ‘fiduciaries for future generations of A.I.G. managers,’ ” said Mr. Wells. “Now, that letter was not a motivational speech, was it?”

Mr. Greenberg agreed that it was not a motivational speech but said it was not an important letter, either. He said it was written by a public relations official, and he had merely “scrawled” his signature on it.

“The statement by itself is not complete,” he said. “The topic is too complex to limit it to one phrase.”

Mr. Greenberg and his lawyers contend that no “compensation trust” as described by A.I.G. ever existed.

By Mr. Greenberg’s description, the big block of A.I.G. shares financing the retirement plan would instantly revert to a charity affiliated with Starr International if someone tried to take control of the company. The trust had several purposes, fending off corporate raiders among them, he said.

Participants in the retirement plan would still, upon retirement, be able to receive the shares allocated to them until the raid, but at that point they would get no more.

The jury also heard on Tuesday from an A.I.G. executive, Terri Austin, who said she had been a participant in the retirement plan for 10 years, until it was discontinued in 2005. She said that when she received letters signed by Mr. Greenberg welcoming her into the elite plan, some were written on A.I.G. letterhead, and others on Starr International letterhead.

The distinction matters because Mr. Greenberg and his lawyers say the retirement plan belonged to Starr International, not to A.I.G.

Ms. Austin recalled going to meetings of plan participants where Mr. Greenberg said the plan assets “would be held in trust for you,” and called it “unlikely that we would run out of shares to fund the above plan for decades, if ever,” implying that there was a permanent compensation trust.

The jurors are only expected to decide one of the issues in the case: whether Starr International committed “conversion” under Mr. Greenberg’s direction, or improperly used assets for other purposes than they were intended. One juror has been dismissed because he did not speak English well enough to understand the complex issues involved.

The other issue in the case, whether there was a breach of a trust, will be decided by Judge Jed S. Rakoff.

The judge has ruled out any discussion of last year’s bailout of A.I.G., saying it could prejudice the jury. Most of the events being described in the case occurred either in 2005 or in the late 1960s, when Starr International and A.I.G. were re-established in much of their present form.

The case was being held in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.
564 2009-06-17 “If the Air Force values more fuel, more cargo, and more passengers, the 777 offers superior capability,” David Bowman, the Boeing executive in charge of the tanker program, said at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday. “We are ready to build America’s next tanker with whatever capability our customer requires.”

Airbus received the news that Boeing could respond with a bigger aircraft with characteristic bravado.

“We need to evaluate it, but certainly they have higher capacity with higher development costs,” the Airbus chief executive, Thomas O. Enders, said. “I think it just shows how seriously they take us this time around as a competitor.”

Mr. Bowman acknowledged that Boeing had not yet conducted critical wind tunnel testing on the refueling apparatus of a 777-based tanker. He said the craft would take about the same time to develop as a tanker version of Boeing’s smaller 767 jetliner, which the company submitted as its bid last time — though the 777 version would cost more simply because it would be bigger.

The 767-based tanker is now in service in Japan. Airbus’s A330-200 tanker, meanwhile — the model that won and lost the Air Force contract last year — has won four other competitions but is still undergoing flight tests for Australia.

Mr. Bowman acknowledged that submitting a yet-to-be-designed 777 could lose Boeing the advantage of time. “If the customer values schedule, then the Airbus tanker is what they want,” he said.

Patrick M. Shanahan, the Boeing vice president for airplane programs, said that the 777 would be fitted into Boeing’s existing assembly plants. “I don’t think it’s a matter of building a new building as much as utilizing the final assembly in a different way,” he said.

Airbus, however, plans to establish an assembly plant in Mobile, Ala., that would also produce freighters based on the same aircraft model. That would give Airbus a long-sought bridgehead in the United States that would help offset its euro-based costs — a disadvantage, since aircraft are priced in dollars.

“This is the only important tanker contract and it has to be awarded,” said Doug McVitie, the founder of Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France. “It is important to Boeing for reasons of prestige and strategy.”

Beyond the A320 freighter plane, Boeing may fear that Airbus could assemble the A320 passenger plane and eventually the A350-XWB in Alabama, Mr. McVitie added.

American certification authorities, meanwhile, will not be able to ignore the recent mid-Atlantic crash of the A330-200 Airbus operated by Air France last week.

The intensely political nature of the tanker contract, and the inevitable protests from the loser each time, has led to suggestions that the contract be split.

Mr. Bowman said that Boeing could live with that solution. “If the customer decides on a dual buy, we’re fine with that, but I’d rather compete and win,” Mr. Bowman said.

At Airbus, the response was similar. “We want to win the whole thing,” Mr. Enders said. “We won it last year, and we want to win it again.”

Bob Smith, chief innovation officer at Honeywell, said a split contract could have implications in determining which model plane each contractor ultimately presents. “If they do a split acquisition, I’m sure it will change the strategies,” Mr. Smith said.

Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Evolution Securities in London, said that a split contract could be seen as an admission that the procurement process was not working.

“It’s like kindergarten sports day: everyone has to have a prize so they don’t cry,” Mr. Cunningham said.
565 2009-06-17 WASHINGTON — President Obama said Tuesday that it would be counterproductive for the United States “to be seen as meddling” in the disputed Iranian presidential election, dismissing criticism from several leading Republicans that he has failed to speak out forcefully enough on behalf of the Iranian opposition.

Although the president said he had “deep concerns about the election,” he also said that any direct involvement by the United States would not be “productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations.” How Iran goes about electing its leaders and establishing freer debate and democratic principles, he told reporters at the White House, “is something ultimately for the Iranian people to decide.”

In his first public statements on Monday, Mr. Obama had said he was deeply troubled by the postelection violence and called on Iranian leaders to respect the democratic process, but he also said he would continue pursuing a direct dialogue with Tehran.

Aides said the White House response had been calibrated to avoid a perception that the United States was trying to push for a regime change. With protesters filling the streets of Tehran to denounce the declared outcome of the election, administration officials said they were wary of doing anything that would allow the declared victor, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to portray the protests as American-led.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, offered some of the sharpest critiques of Mr. Obama’s tempered response.
566 2009-06-17 In contrast, Iran looked to the Obama team as a far more dynamic, open society eager to restore its traditional role as one of the great powers — if not the greatest — in the . To the country’s leadership, and to many of the reformers as well, the nuclear program is all about bolstering its chances at restoration. Unlike North Korea, Iran may not need a fully tested nuclear weapon. It just needs to create the perception that, with a few twists of the screwdriver, it is capable of turning a peaceful nuclear infrastructure into a weapons program, in a matter of months. The perception may be as powerful as the bomb.

“Nuclear weapons capability would surely add to Iran’s ability to twist arms in the region,” , the administration’s chief Iran strategist, wrote with David Makovsky in their new book about the Middle East, “Myths, Illusions, and Peace,” published just as Iranians went to the polls last week in the now-disputed election. The book, completed before Mr. Ross was hired by the administration, is causing considerable in the White House, because it lays out a step-by-step recipe for what the authors call the “hybrid option” — combining diplomatic initiatives with excruciating economic pressure on the most vulnerable elements of Iran’s oil sector, whose output is declining.

But re-analyzing the problem is easier than designing workable strategies to reverse what may now be irreversible. American presidents have been certain they could contain North Korea, or perhaps speed its collapse, since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. That was the same year that the organized a coup that deposed Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq and installed the Shah — a cold war operation for which Mr. Obama just publicly apologized during his speech at Cairo University last month. Very little has broken Washington’s way in either country in the ensuing 56 years.

So is there any reason to believe that Mr. Obama’s new approaches will change the dynamic with either country? Maybe, but there are huge risks ahead.

The decision to confront North Korea with overwhelming pressure — designed to bring its shipping and financial transactions to a virtual standstill — is based on the conclusion that re-entering negotiations to buy the dismantlement of the country’s main nuclear facility at Yongbyon is a futile strategy. It has already failed twice, once for President Clinton, once for President Bush. When , the defense secretary, said “I’m tired of buying the same horse twice,” he was signaling that the administration would not offer fuel, food or security guarantees in return for incremental steps to take apart the reactors and plutonium reprocessing facilities inside the high walls at Yongbyon.

It may not be a problem; North Korea says it is never coming back to the talks. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. But until then, Mr. Obama’s “engagement” strategy is more about overwhelming pressure than diplomacy.

By hailing and seeking to inspect suspect North Korean ships in the Sea of Japan, and then pressing nations around the world to pick apart the ship’s cargo once they pull into ports for refueling, Mr. Obama is seeking to bring to a grinding halt the last revenue-producing element of the North Korean economy. The risk is that, however carefully designed to avoid open confrontation, the North Koreans will lash out — perhaps opening fire on American, Japanese or South Korean ships, creating an incident that could quickly escalate.

“Right now, our biggest worry is the North Korean captain who does something very, very stupid,” a senior military officer in the Pacific Command said Monday. “And when you intercept ships and tell them to stop, the risk is that someone can’t control their adrenaline. Then we can find ourselves back in the old days.”

In Iran, in contrast, the administration’s approach is likely to be far more about diplomacy in the next few months than about pressure.

Mr. Obama’s aides are clearly seeking to stand back and watch while protestors take to the streets shouting slogans against the country’s ruling elite. The White House fears that if the president speaks too supportively of the protestors, it will give President the chance he is looking for to portray the angry crowds as American stooges. After all, in Iran it does not take much to stoke memories of the Mossadeq fiasco.

It is too early to know whether these protests, which no one predicted, will gain steam or, like the uprising 20 years ago this month in , simply burn out. Mr. Obama’s conundrum is that he does not have the luxury of time. International nuclear inspectors describe a nuclear program that is speeding up — moving the country very close to the nuclear capability that the , and Iran’s Arab neighbors say they cannot abide.

Yet if the new administration moves too quickly in executing the strategy of “engagement with pressure” — what Mr. Ross and Mr. Makovsky describe in their book as showing the mullahs that “Iran’s economic lifeline is going to be cut and the oil revenues are going to dry up” — it could quickly turn those young Iranians in the streets against Washington. And as one of Mr. Obama’s strategists put it the other day, hearing those protestors shout down the clerics “sounds a lot better to my ears than ‘Death to America!’ ”
567 2009-06-17 RICHFIELD, Minn. (AP) — The Best Buy Company, the consumer electronics retailer, said on Tuesday that its first-quarter profit fell 15 percent even as its biggest competitor exited the market.

The quarter’s results compare with a year-ago period when the government’s stimulus checks put extra cash in the hands of consumers. But Best Buy, the nation’s biggest electronics retailer, still beat earnings estimates.

Best Buy noted increases in the sales of laptops and cellphones, as well as a rise in repairs. Sales fell for digital cameras, appliances, video games and movies.

Profit was $153 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter ended May 30. That compares with $179 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 12 percent, to $10.1 billion, as it opened 185 stores and gained some market share from the closed Circuit City Stores. The company said it gained 2 percentage points of market share in the quarter and that its gains accelerated after the March 8 closing of Circuit City outlets across the country.

581 2009-06-18 This program doesn't play well with field-based contact managers like Google's or the iPhone's, but the beauty is that it holds whatever you want: recipes, brainstorms, article fragments, driving directions, lists, Web addresses and so on. And you can find anything in a fraction of a second. (Actually, iData now lets you create field-based databases as well, but my freeform database has been growing since about 1988 and I'm not about to convert it.)

* The other database I use is my e-mail program. I'm not a believer in the "empty your Inbox every day" philosophy; in fact, my Inbox is my To Do list, which works great. When I've dealt with something, I delete or file it. When I haven't, its presence in that list reminds me that it needs doing. (I have a lot of e-mail folders. I also have a lot of "message rules" that file incoming mail automatically into appropriate folders.)

* I use macro software. I can't understand why "press a key to launch a program" features aren't standard in Mac OS X and Windows. (Yeah, I know, Windows has a limited version of this, involving shortcut icons. But I want to make up my own keyboard shortcuts, and as many as I want.)

So I use Shift-Control-W to open Microsoft Word, Shift-Control-C for my calendar program, and so on. The less I have to use the mouse, the faster I fly.

* I have a great calendar program. It's Now Up-to-Date, a very old but very brilliant networkable, cross-platform calendar program. I can edit appointments on my laptop while on a trip; when I return, my changes get merged into my wife's and kids' computers automatically.

* I don't waste time. I travel a lot for speaking engagements--so much that the $60 a month I have to pay for my tiny Sprint USB cellular modem stick seems like a bargain. It means I can be online in a car, in the X-ray line at the airport, on a plane stuck on the runway, and so on.

My 3-pound laptop is my main machine, by the way, for the same reason--so that I can be productive during any little blob of downtime.

* Finally, I enjoy two luxuries that not everyone will be able to replicate. First, I'm just the sort of person who kind of knows what he wants to say; I can't remember ever staring at the blank screen, trying to think of what to write. And I'm lucky enough that I don't spend time on bills, taxes, travel arrangements, kid-activity scheduling, and so on; my sainted wife takes care of all that administrative overhead.

There, now you know my secrets. Steal this document, with my compliments.

590 2009-06-18 In an expansion of its crackdown on drug cartels, the Obama administration plans to announce Thursday that it will give Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents the authority to investigate drug crimes. Justice Department officials refused to divulge details of their plans, saying they did not want to pre-empt the news conference. But officials familiar with the plan said it would settle a long-running turf battle between the immigration agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration that has seriously undermined the efforts of both. The decision came amid drug-related violence that left more than 6,000 people dead in Mexico last year. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called the Justice Department’s decision “welcome news,” saying, “The cartels that smuggle drugs and illegal immigrants have integrated their activities, and now the federal agencies will have a better integrated response.”
591 2009-06-18 Much of that jump comes from estimated gas in shale rocks, which drilling companies have only recently learned how to tap. They have developed a technique called hydraulic fracturing, in which water is injected at high pressure into wells to shatter rocks deep underground, helping to release trapped gas.

The method, perfected in recent years in places like Texas and Pennsylvania, has set off a boom in new drilling, but is coming under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny. Shale gas accounts for 616 trillion cubic feet of reserves, or a third of the total, according to the report.

“New and advanced exploration, well drilling and completion technologies are allowing us increasingly better access to domestic gas resources — especially ‘unconventional’ gas — which, not that long ago, were considered impractical or uneconomical to pursue,” said John B. Curtis, a geology professor at the Colorado School of Mines and the report’s principal author.

The huge increase in estimated gas supplies comes just as concerns about energy security and climate change are prompting the most profound shift in energy policy since the oil shocks of the 1970s.

The Obama administration has sought more stringent fuel standards for new cars, and Congress is debating regulations that would progressively limit carbon dioxide emissions throughout the economy. The administration has taken a cautious approach to conventional energy resources, freezing leases to develop oil shale reserves and carefully reviewing future offshore leases for oil and gas.

Instead, the administration seeks to increase the share of renewable energy, especially wind and solar power. But experts say that meeting these goals will prove challenging given the scale of the nation’s energy use and the costs involved in switching from fossil fuels.

Shale gas currently provides a small fraction of the nation’s total gas production. But many experts believe the rising supply of natural gas means it can substitute for other fossil fuels. With the output of conventional gas forecast to decline, the Energy Department expects that shale production will rise substantially to meet higher demand, as will imports.

Natural gas accounts for about a quarter of the nation’s total energy use, and 22 percent of electrical production. Coal accounts for about half of the nation’s power generation, while oil dominates transportation fuels. While gas generates less carbon dioxide than oil or coal, it still accounted for about 20 percent of domestic energy-related emissions in 2006.

The Energy Department estimates that demand for natural gas will rise by 13 percent by 2030. In the power sector, utilities have been switching to natural gas from coal, but further increases in the use of gas will most likely depend on whether Congress puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, as it is considering. That would favor cleaner fuels like gas.

“It’s nice to have aspirations about renewable energy and efficiency, but we need to recognize these are long-term goals and that we need something to get us there in the meantime,” said Guy F. Caruso, a former administrator of the Energy Information Administration. “Natural gas has a role to play as a bridge because of the long lead time and scalability issues of renewable fuels.”

That the nation’s gas reserves were bigger than expected does not mean they will necessarily be developed, Mr. Caruso warned. “There are some things to be cautious about,” he said, “and obviously one of them is cost, and the other is regulatory risk.”

In recent years, industry executives and analysts have been surprised by the discovery and successful development of new supplies of shale gas, like the Barnett Shale in the area around Fort Worth.

But higher drilling costs and the extensive use of water to fracture shale rocks have raised concerns about the long-run commercial potential of these supplies. Some environmental groups fear that hydraulic fracturing will pollute drinking water, and Congress is considering tighter regulation of the practice.

Mr. Caruso said that gas prices needed to be around $4 to $6 per thousand cubic feet to justify developing shale beds. They have fallen below that level at times in recent months, though gas settled Wednesday at $4.25.

For advocates of the gas industry, the report vindicates the potential of natural gas in the economy.

“Natural gas is part of the solution for a low-carbon future, and not an impediment,” said Chris McGill, the managing director for policy analysis at the American Gas Association, a trade group. “It has been difficult to get policy makers over that hump. Many have a vision of gas as a resource we’re running out of, and that’s just not true.”
592 2009-06-18 Right after Brooke Astor changed her will on Jan. 12, 2004, she chatted with one of her lawyers, Francis X. Morrissey Jr., about her past, reflecting on a meeting she had with the dowager empress of China, observations in one of her autobiographies that Beijing was 25 years behind Shanghai and Shanghai 25 years behind the West, and even the price of gold, according to a memo Mr. Morrissey wrote to himself.

Three weeks later, Mrs. Astor’s son, Anthony D. Marshall, drafted a letter to another of his mother’s lawyers on Feb. 3, 2004, in which he wrote that he and his mother had “never been as close as we are at present,” and that he had declined his mother’s constant offers to give him more because “I had Charlene,” referring to his wife.

And according to a transcript of a speech Mrs. Astor made at the Knickerbocker Club on Feb. 10, 2004, she said, among other things, that her son had “never asked me for anything,” that he had “done a magnificent job” managing her affairs and that “I love him and his wife Charlene and my great hope is for their continued happiness.”

Those documents, all presented on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, portray a clear-headed Mrs. Astor, bright enough to talk about world affairs, and so in love with her son and daughter-in-law she wanted to give them all she could.

But to prosecutors, the documents represent a carefully crafted image that belies reality. They contend that from helping to prepare the laudatory remarks Mrs. Astor gave at the Knickerbocker Club to drafting memo after memo until they got their stories straight, Mr. Marshall, 85, and Mr. Morrissey, 66, meticulously planned the documents to make the world think that Mrs. Astor was lucid and eager to funnel millions their way through changes to her will.
593 2009-06-18 If the administration gets its way, the agency, a sort of Food and Drug Administration for financial products, would be empowered to tell banks to tidy up their offerings and make sure consumers have the information they need to make sound financial decisions, while being protected from scams.

It could, among other things, dictate standards for some products before banks could bring them to market, and push banks to favor plain vanilla loans over more exotic home loans, which could be required to carry warnings. Unfair terms and practices among credit card issuers would also be weeded out.

If Congress approved the agency, it would be the first time that consumers would have a seat at the banking regulatory table.

“The argument for doing that is you’ll have an agency that’s only focused on protecting consumers," said Donald G. Ogilvie, chairman of the Deloitte Center for Banking Solutions. “The argument against that is you’ll have an agency that’s only interested in protecting consumers."

But it also sets up a potential turf battle among the myriad agencies that are currently tasked with protecting consumers, including the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, which the banks would like to see maintain this oversight.

Banking groups are concerned about the costs a new layer of regulation might impose, and the prospect of more examiners crowding into their banks.

“You are talking about an agency that is authorized to design financial products and, in fact, say that they must be offered first, over the banks’ own products,” said Mr. Yingling.

In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Warren said the new agency could have implications beyond consumer protection. Protecting consumers from risky products ultimately protects the entire financial system, she argued.

“This crisis started one mortgage at a time,” said Ms. Warren, who, as the chairwoman of the Congressional panel that oversees government spending on the financial bailout, has the ear of many lawmakers. “The bad products that were sold household by household not only destabilized families. When they were sliced and diced and passed along through mortgage-backed securities, they magnified risk throughout the economy.”

The agency would most likely be harder on banks that profited from high-risk products, Ms. Warren said. But it may benefit banks that offer more consumer-friendly products that are “lost in the storm of advertising” for riskier products, she said.

While banks will lobby to water down the agency’s proposed powers in Congress, the devil will be in the details. One important question is how the agency would be financed. A spokesman for the Treasury said it would be paid for in part through “fees assessed on entities and transactions across the financial sector.” While he was not more specific, there could be conflicts of interest if, for example, banks paid fees directly to the agency to seek approval for their products.

Another issue will be the division between state and federal power. State attorneys general have often cracked down on mortgage fraud, high credit card rates, payday lending and other consumer financial protection issues that the new agency would take up. Mr. Yingling, of the American Bankers Association, expressed concern that financial companies might receive uneven treatment at the state and national level.

It may also be difficult to separate “consumers” from “investors,” leaving uncertainty about whether some financial products fall under the purview of the new agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors many investor products. A spokesman for the Treasury said the S.E.C. would maintain its power over investor protection.

The president’s proposal resembles legislation introduced a few months ago by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. He acknowledged the idea of an agency faced a fight on Capitol Hill.

“Never underestimate the banks,” he said.
594 2009-06-18 Three quarters of a century ago, President Franklin Roosevelt earned the undying enmity of Wall Street when he used his enormous popularity to push through a series of radical regulatory reforms that completely changed the norms of the financial industry.

Wall Street hated the reforms, of course, but Roosevelt didn’t care. Wall Street and the financial industry had engaged in practices they shouldn’t have, and had helped lead the country into the Great Depression. Those practices had to be stopped. To the president, that’s all that mattered.

On Wednesday, President Obama unveiled what he described as “a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression.”

In terms of the sheer number of proposals, outlined in an 88-page document the administration released on Tuesday, that is undoubtedly true. But in terms of the scope and breadth of the Obama plan  and more important, in terms of its overall effect on Wall Street’s modus operandi  it’s not even close to what Roosevelt accomplished during the Great Depression.

Rather, the Obama plan is little more than an attempt to stick some new regulatory fingers into a very leaky financial dam rather than rebuild the dam itself. Without question, the latter would be more difficult, more contentious and probably more expensive. But it would also have more lasting value.

On the surface, there was no area of the financial industry the plan didn’t touch. “I was impressed by the real estate it covered,” said Daniel Alpert, the managing partner of Westwood Capital. The president’s proposal addresses derivatives, mortgages, capital, and even, in the wake of the American International Group fiasco, insurance companies. Among other things, it would give new regulatory powers to the Federal Reserve, create a new agency to help protect consumers of financial products, and make derivative-trading more transparent. It would give the government the power to take over large bank holding companies or troubled investment banks  powers it doesn’t have now  and would force banks to hold onto some of the mortgage-backed securities they create and sell to investors.

But it’s what the plan doesn’t do that is most notable.

Take, for instance, the handful of banks that are “too big to fail” and which, in some cases, the government has had to spend tens of billions of dollars propping up. In a recent speech in China, the former Federal Reserve chairman  and current Obama adviser  Paul Volcker called on the government to limit the functions of any financial institution, like the big banks, that will always be reliant on the taxpayer should they get into trouble. Why, for instance, should they be allowed to trade for their own account  reaping huge profits and bonuses if they succeed  if the government has to bail them out if they make big mistakes, Mr. Volcker asked.

Many experts, even at the Federal Reserve, think that the country should not allow banks to become too big to fail. Some of them suggest specific economic disincentives to prevent growing too big and requirements that would break them up before reaching that point.

Yet the Obama plan accepts the notion of “too big to fail”  in the plan those institutions are labeled “Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies”  and proposes to regulate them more “robustly.” The idea of creating either market incentives or regulation that would effectively make banking safe and boring  and push risk-taking to institutions that are not too big to fail  isn’t even broached.

Or take derivatives. The Obama plan calls for plain vanilla derivatives to be traded on an exchange. But standard, plain vanilla derivatives are not what caused so much trouble for the world’s financial system. Rather it was the so-called bespoke derivatives  customized, one-of-a-kind products that generated enormous profits for institutions like A.I.G. that created them, and, in the end, generated enormous damage to the financial system. For these derivatives, the Treasury Department merely wants to set up a clearinghouse so that their price and trading activity can be more readily seen. But it doesn’t attempt to diminish the use of these bespoke derivatives.

“Derivatives should have to trade on an exchange in order to have lower capital requirements,” said Ari Bergmann, a managing principal with Penso Capital Markets. Mr. Bergmann also thought that another way to restrict the bespoke derivatives would be to strip them of their exemption from the antigambling statutes. In a recent article in The Financial Times, George Soros, the financier, wrote that “regulators ought to insist that derivatives be homogeneous, standardized and transparent.” Under the Obama plan, however, customized derivatives will remain an important part of the financial system.

Everywhere you look in the plan, you see the same thing: additional regulation on the margin, but nothing that amounts to a true overhaul. The new bank supervisor, for instance, is really nothing more than two smaller agencies combined into one. The plans calls for new regulations aimed at the ratings agencies, but offers nothing that would suggest radical revamping.

The plan places enormous trust in the judgment of the Federal Reserve  trust that critics say has not really been borne out by its actions during the Internet and housing bubbles. Firms will have to put up a little more capital, and deal with a little more oversight, but once the financial crisis is over, it will, in all likelihood, be back to business as usual.

The regulatory structure erected by Roosevelt during the Great Depression  including the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the establishment of serious banking oversight, the guaranteeing of bank deposits and the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from investment banking  lasted six decades before they started to crumble in the 1990s. In retrospect, it would be hard to envision even the best-constructed regulation lasting more than that. If Mr. Obama hopes to create a regulatory environment that stands for another six decades, he is going to have to do what Roosevelt did once upon a time. He is going to have make some bankers mad.
595 2009-06-18 “You find in most of the people who apply, this is a process that starts several years in advance,” said Cmdr. Joe Carpenter, a spokesman for the Naval Academy. “The process itself is much more involved and lengthy, and often involves a Congressional nomination, which is not something you do on a whim.”

Commander Carpenter and officials from the other academies pointed to intensified marketing campaigns in recent years that they say played a major role in increasing the application pool.

The Military Academy, for instance, for the first time bought billboard space at airports in Los Angeles, Dallas-Forth Worth and Atlanta and Dulles airport near Washington during the holiday season last year, said Col. Deborah McDonald, director of admissions.

Colonel McDonald said her office had also expanded its efforts to stay in touch with potential candidates via letters and e-mail messages, and worked more closely with members of Congress to help them with the process of nominating applicants.

Commander Carpenter said that the Naval Academy began expanding its recruiting in urban areas, including New York, two years ago, and that the effort had begun to pay off, not only in more applicants from those areas, but also more minority applicants. Applications from minority students were up by 57 percent this year over last, he said.

The number of applicants to West Point was the highest in at least several years, but was slightly lower than the period immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when interest in all the military academies surged. In those years, applications to West Point rose over 12,000. But while the numbers have crept back down in the last four years, they remain higher than before the attacks, she said.

At the Air Force Academy, applications were at their highest point in five years, said John Van Winkle, the deputy chief of media relations for the academy.

The recession has also clearly benefited military recruiting this year, including for the Army, which had struggled to meet its quotas in some recent years.

The rise in applications at the military academies, which was reported this week by The Associated Press, is similar to the trend at many well-known public colleges, reflecting perhaps their lower cost. The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville; all reported higher application numbers this year. But so did a number of elite colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth and Brown.

The drawdown of American forces in Iraq, combined with fewer casualties there, may have also contributed to easing some parents’ concerns about having their children attend West Point, Colonel McDonald said. The Army has sustained by far the most casualties in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But Commander Carpenter noted that interest in the Marine Corps among Naval Academy students has been on the rise in recent years, even though Marines represent the second-largest group of casualties in those wars.
596 2009-06-18 YouTube said it had relaxed its usual restrictions on violent videos to allow the images from Iran to reach the rest of the world.

“In general, we do not allow graphic or gratuitous violence on YouTube,” the company said in a statement. “However, we make exceptions for videos that have educational, documentary, or scientific value. The limitations being placed on mainstream media reporting from within Iran make it even more important that citizens in Iran be able to use YouTube to capture their experiences for the world to see.” But the Iranian government continued to try to restrict Web communications. On Wednesday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned that protesters trying to stoke tensions using Internet sites like Twitter would be subject to retribution.

“We warn those who propagate riots and spread rumors that our legal action against them will cost them dearly,” a statement from the military force said.

At the same time, the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi was using his public profile page on Facebook to organize protests scheduled for Thursday.

Meanwhile, the Iranian visas of many visiting journalists have expired, meaning that the corps of international reporters in the country is shrinking. Newspapers and television news networks are increasingly supplementing their on-the-ground reporting with video images, with frequent caveats that their authenticity cannot be verified.

On Wednesday, CNN frequently showed amateur videos, with a graphic that labeled them “unverified material.” It showed a YouTube video of the aftermath of an apparent raid at Tehran University. The video showed rooms that appeared to have been burned extensively.

It is unclear how the gripping videos are being uploaded, given the restrictions on Internet access within Iran. Behind the scenes, a sophisticated cat and mouse game is playing out, with the Iranian government trying to thwart free Internet communications, and an informal coalition of Iranian protesters and their sympathizers trying to keep the floodgates open to data.

Throughout the week, supporters of the protesters around the world had been making their own computers available to Iranians who wanted to evade government censors.

These people have been publishing the IP addresses of their computers to public forums like Twitter — offering them as so-called proxy servers.

Greg Walton, founder of Psiphon, a provider of Web proxy services, said the continued Internet activity from Iran was a testament to the durability of the Internet and the commitment of Iranians to get their story out despite the government crackdown.

“Information is still coming out of Iran,” he said. “Twitter is still buzzing from people giving live updates from the street, and YouTube is full of live videos testifying to the brutality of the regime’s crackdown. The Internet is fragile but still operational.”

Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent and a native of Iran, arrived back in London on Tuesday after her one-week Iranian visa expired. While CNN still has personnel in Tehran, Ms. Amanpour expects a heavier emphasis on amateur video.

“You can’t keep any of this news down anymore, and that’s a huge change from the past,” she said in an interview. “The process of getting the word out is totally democratized.”
597 2009-06-18 Federal investigators have begun issuing subpoenas to landlords who leased space to City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook and several nonprofit groups closely linked to him after a published report last week that the groups had billed New York City more than $100,000 in inflated rent payments.

At least one of the landlords confirmed receiving a subpoena this week from the Justice Department but said he was instructed not to discuss it.

“I got it, that’s all I can say,” said Herb Brooks, who leases a building at 3687 White Plains Road in the Bronx and sublets it to Mr. Seabrook for his City Council district office and for nonprofit groups linked to him.

The New York Times reported last week that in at least two cases, Mr. Seabrook rented buildings from landlords at one price and struck side deals with the landlords to share the space, for an additional fee, with a nonprofit organization he founded. The organization, the African-American Bronx Unity Day Parade Inc., then sublet the space at far higher rates to three other nonprofit groups that were run by the councilman’s associates and funded through his Council discretionary funds, city records and interviews showed. Two of the nonprofit groups also billed the city for a building they did not occupy.

From July 2004 through March 2007, the city paid more than $156,900 in rent reimbursements for space that cost the parade organization only $40,000 to rent, The Times found.

Mr. Brooks, for example, said Mr. Seabrook personally arranged a deal with him in 2005 to rent part of the building at $30,000 a year for his district office to be paid directly by the City Council, and to use the remaining space for nonprofit groups for an additional $10,000 a year.
598 2009-06-18 Bevacqua said the days of selling 75 tents at a tournament were over and that the association sold about 50 to this year’s Open. To compensate, the association sold more individual tickets to the three practice rounds.

Over all, Bevacqua expected revenue from hospitality tents, catering, tickets, merchandise sales and other items this year to be about 20 percent lower than what the association had hoped to bring in when times were good, though he still expected the event to turn a profit. The association reported total revenue of nearly $156 million last fiscal year.

To help make ends meet, the U.S.G.A. has trimmed spending this year. The tents for the news media and others are less ornate, for instance, and silverware in the dining areas has been replaced with biodegradable plastic forks and knives.

That will only partly offset the decline in revenue from the hospitality tents. Some companies that agreed to rent them before the financial crisis took hold are not using them to avoid having to pay for food and beverages, or to steer clear of unwanted scrutiny. Other companies, like National Grid, the largest utility on Long Island, are giving some of their tickets to employees, community groups and charities, which are auctioning them.

On Tuesday, one stretch of hospitality tents along the first fairway, called the Tillinghast Village, was nearly empty, with the lights out at those purchased by Donald Trump, Fidelity Investments, Jefferies, Hertz, MetLife and others.

At the Empire Village, on the 18th fairway, there was little activity at tents sold to companies including TD Bank, Charles Schwab, UBS, Barclays and Deutsche Bank.

Of course, by the end of the week, more guests are likely to show up, particularly at the tents occupied by the association’s four corporate partners, American Express, I.B.M., Lexus and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

For them, entertainment is only one of the things they get out of the event. Lexusprovides hundreds of cars to the golfers and association officials. It has a tent where its latest models are showcased. At a hospitality tent on the 15th fairway, Lexus dealers and customers can rub shoulders with Johnny Miller, Annika Sorenstam and other golf personalities.

I.B.M. runs the association’s Web site and has invited clients to see the technology being used, as well as some of the action on the course.

“They certainly watch some golf, but we like for them to see the work areas,” said Rick Singer, I.B.M.’s director of worldwide sponsorship marketing. “This is not about hospitality; it’s a global platform for our technology.”

American Express sells tickets and package tours to the Open to its card-holders, who can also get a free radio headset to follow the broadcast of the tournament as they walk the course.

The more muted atmosphere at the event, though, could trim hopes of an economic windfall for the municipalities near the golf course. In 2002, when the event was also at Bethpage, security was so tight that fans could not stop in nearby areas. Business dried up.

This year, Farmingdale is running trolleys from the train station to the park and showing golf movies on the village green.

“Economically, it’s hard to put a dollar figure on it, but we’re hoping for a big shot in the arm for the small boutiques here and pubs and restaurants,” said David E. Smollett, the village’s administrator, who expects a 10-fold increase in foot traffic this week.

Joo Park and his wife, Sue, who own the All Aboard deli across from the Long Island Rail Road station, said the number of visitors in the morning was up threefold. He tripled his recent order for sandwich rolls, hoping to have enough to handle his three golf specials: the Tiger, the Phil and the Rocco. But many golf fans do not appear to be wandering far from the train station. On Main Street, many shops were closed by 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Only a few bars and restaurants were open, including Jim’s Stogies, a cigar shop.

The big-screen televisions that usually show baseball games will have golf on from beginning to end this weekend. The shop’s owner, Jim Bueche, said customers had stopped in this week from Ohio and Colorado.

But while he hopes to make a little extra money this week, he is not getting ahead of himself.

“I’m not here to make a million dollars,” Bueche said. “I’m just here to work and enjoy.”
599 2009-06-18 OTTAWA — The Canadian government said on Wednesday that it would provide a billion Canadian dollars to its struggling pulp and paper industry, a move seen as an effort to counter a controversial American subsidy.

Although billed as an environmental measure, the assistance, about $882 million, appears to be prompted by an American alternative fuels program that has inadvertently become a multibillion-dollar windfall for producers in the United States.

Canada’s natural resources minister, Lisa Raitt, said that under the program, pulp and paper makers would receive 16 Canadian cents for each liter of a pulp waste product that they burn to provide steam and power for their plants.

Known as black liquor, the byproduct has powered mills since the 1930s. Recently, American paper companies began blending diesel fuel into the black liquor to qualify for tax credits intended to encourage the industry to combine biofuels with conventional sources of petroleum. Critics say that the practice was not what Congress intended and has, by some estimates, given the industry a $6 billion shot in the arm.

Under Canada’s program, mill owners must use the payments they receive within three years to improve the “energy efficiency or environmental performance” of existing operations. Background information provided by the government offered no details about how that requirement would be enforced or what efficiency and environmental goals producers must be met.
600 2009-06-18 “The decline in real income should dampen demand for agricultural commodities and, all else being equal, decrease agricultural product prices,” the report said of the period when the economy remains weak.

The report was prepared by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

As a recovery takes hold, the prices for many, but not all, agricultural commodities will rise, said the report. That growth in agricultural production and consumption is expected to be driven mainly by developing countries.

“There is lessening evidence to suspect that the world has undergone any structural upward shift in real agricultural commodity prices,” the two organizations said in the joint report, “Agricultural Outlook: 2008-2018,” covering biofuels, cereals, oilseeds, sugar, meats and dairy products.

Ken Ash, director of trade and agriculture at the O.E.C.D., added that there was a “low risk” of another major spike in prices given the recent fall in oil prices, the more moderate outlook for global economic growth and more judicious use of farmland.

The report forecast that prices for food commodities would on average rise 10 percent to 20 percent in the next decade, compared with the average prices during the decade ended in 2006. Prices for vegetable oils would be more than 30 percent higher.

Dairy prices are expected to rise slightly in the next 10 years, driven up by higher costs of energy and vegetable oil, with a notable 12 percent increase in average butter prices. Dairy demand is expected, in particular from developing countries, helped by income and population growth and changing diets.

Meat prices, it said, were unlikely to surpass the 1997-to-2006 average. They did not surge with other prices in the period before 2008.

The years 2007 and 2008 are not included in the historical data period because of the unusual price rally during those years, which made a price comparison less reliable, the O.E.C.D. said.

The report also highlighted the link between agricultural prices and energy costs, which can make up a substantial portion of a farmer’s overall expenses. The report’s forecast assumed crude prices of about $70 a barrel by the end of 2018. Oil costs about that much now.

If oil prices were to increase to $100 or more a barrel, “agricultural prices would be significantly higher,” the report said, “with the largest impact on crops, driven mainly by reduced crop production with higher input costs, but also increased feedstock demand for biofuels.”

For biofuel markets, “prospects remain uncertain” because of unknown factors like the price of oil, policy changes and technological developments.

“Biofuels will struggle to compete with relatively low fossil fuel prices as long as crude oil prices remain in the $60 to $70” range, it said, “although biofuel support policies underpin ethanol and biodiesel prices and production.”

Over all, the report paints a picture of a food sector that is relatively resilient, with commodity prices remaining above historical averages, while production, consumption and trade increase in developing countries.

But behind this relatively rosy picture “lies a more disturbing story,” the report cautioned.

“High food costs, combined with the global credit crunch, falling international trade and investment flows, lower remittances and budgetary pressures on development aid, are reversing the progress made in combating global poverty,” it said.
601 2009-06-18 Rain, the South Korean pop star and actor, has settled a suit brought by a Hawaiian concert promotion company that won an $8 million judgment against him and his managers, Agence France-Presse reported. In March a court found in favor of the promoter, Click Entertainment, which had sued Rain and his representatives at JYP Entertainment after the singer (whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon) canceled a concert scheduled for June 15, 2007, at Honolulu’s Aloha Stadium, a few days before the show. Lawyers for the promoter argued that Rain never intended to perform, and that his crew members never shipped their equipment or applied for visas. Citing a report from the Korean Yonhap news agency, Agence France-Presse said that the two sides reached an agreement on June 10 to settle the case and avoid an appeal. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
602 2009-06-18 Eddie Bauer, the outdoor-clothing chain that sold goose-down coats to Mount Everest mountaineers and college students alike, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and said it planned to sell itself for $202 million to CCMP Capital Advisors, a private equity firm.

The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware, and said that Bank of America, GE Capital and the CIT Group have agreed to provide up to $100 million in financing during the bankruptcy case.

Eddie Bauer, which has 371 stores in North America, is pursuing a sale to CCMP through what is known as a 363 sale process in bankruptcy court. A judge would need to approve the sale, and other potential bidders could emerge.

CCMP, as a so-called stalking horse bidder, is entitled to a $5 million breakup fee if it loses during the court-supervised auction process.

“We’re not looking to liquidate the company or close most of the stores,” said Jonathan Lynch, a CCMP managing director. “We’re trying to help 8,000 employees save an iconic American brand.”

The retailer said its stores, catalog business and Web sites would continue operating, and that it intended to honor customer gift cards, returns and loyalty program points.

Eddie Bauer is the latest apparel chain to file for bankruptcy protection in recent months, along with Mervyn’s, Steve & Barry’s, Goody’s and Gottschalk’s.

Eddie Bauer was struggling to repay its debt after consumers stopped spending on anything but necessities. The falloff in sales came as Eddie Bauer was trying to pull off a multiyear turnaround that included cost cuts, as well as changes to its management team and its merchandise.

“Eddie Bauer is a good company with a great brand and a bad balance sheet,” Neil Fiske, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement. “This process will allow the business to emerge with far less debt, positioned for growth as the economy recovers and as our new products gain traction. We expect this process to be completed very quickly, protecting our employees and critical vendor partners every step of the way.”

Shares of Eddie Bauer Holdings had been trading for about 25 cents since last week.

For the three months ended April 4, Eddie Bauer’s loss increased to $44.5 million, or $1.44 a share from $19.3 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Sales at full-price and outlet stores open at least a year declined 13.7 percent, in contrast to a 0.5 percent increase a year earlier. (Sales were hurt in part by Canadian exchange rates.) On top of the sales declines, the company had $427 million in debt and was struggling in the tight credit market.

In a court filing, the company said its debt load was a result of loans it took on when its onetime parent company, Spiegel, filed for bankruptcy in 2003. Eddie Bauer took on $300 million in debt, as well as Spiegel’s benefits and pension plans. The retailer said that about 50 percent of its earnings now go toward paying down that debt.

Even after cutting costs as part of its turnaround, Eddie Bauer made additional reductions. In January, it cut about 15 percent of its nonretail staff. The chain said it would also freeze salaries, limit its capital spending to about $15 million, rethink some benefits programs, reduce the size of its board and the board’s compensation, and lower Mr. Fiske’s salary by 10 percent for the rest of the year.

Eddie Bauer’s proposed buyer, CCMP, is a middle-market private equity firm that once served as a buyout arm of JPMorgan Chase. Last year, it hired Greg Brenneman, who helped fix Burger King and Continental Airlines, as its chairman.

CCMP first took a look at Eddie Bauer in 2004, but was dissuaded from making an investment because the company was then focused on becoming a women’s casual apparel chain, along the lines of J. Jill or Talbots.

“When we looked at it in 2004, we thought management was taking it in the wrong direction,” Mr. Lynch of CCMP said. “Frankly, it had lost its way.”

But a new management team led by Mr. Fiske began returning the company, founded in Seattle in 1920, back toward its outdoor adventure roots. (After nearly freezing to death during a hunting trip in the 1930s, the founder, Eddie Bauer, designed and eventually patented a quilted goose-down jacket.)

Advisers to Eddie Bauer reached out again to CCMP about a potential investment earlier this year. CCMP said it planned to support Mr. Fiske and his management team, and was seeking to keep most of the company’s stores and employees.

“Roll forward to where we are today,” Mr. Lynch said, “the business is under new leadership that’s doing all the right things.”

Eddie Bauer celebrated a new line called First Ascent last month by outfitting two mountaineers as they took on Mount Everest: Ed Viesturs (who has made a habit of climbing 8,000-meter peaks without bottled oxygen) and Peter Whittaker, the nephew of Jim Whittaker, who was also wearing Eddie Bauer when he became the first American to successfully reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1963.

“This is a milestone for us,” Mr. Fiske said in a statement last month. “It puts us literally back on top of the world.”
603 2009-06-18 This small army awaited Quinn’s words about the path and outcome of a fairly routine June rainstorm.

“There is pressure on you to get it right,” said Quinn, who has worked as a meteorologist at more than 300 golf tournaments. “But it helps to be here on location, making a forecast for this one swath of land.”

When Quinn delivered his forecast Wednesday — stormy conditions from Thursday to Sunday, with the worst rain likely to be Thursday and Saturday — he unleashed a behind-the-scenes legion that readied for the worst.

At the highest levels, U.S.G.A. executives and the Bethpage grounds crew chief appeared to be gearing up for the likelihood that play will be suspended at some point.

“If we can’t play it, if it’s not fair to be playing the ball as it lies, we’ll suspend play,” said Jim Hyler, a U.S.G.A. vice president and the chairman of the championship committee. “We’ll stay here until we get a champion.”

Craig Currier, the Bethpage superintendent, seemed pessimistic about an uninterrupted tournament.

“If we get an inch of rain Thursday, I’m fairly sure we’ll get a suspension,” Currier said. “Especially if it’s an inch of rain in a couple hours. If it’s spread over the whole day, we’ll be O.K. But if it comes quickly, the bunkers will fill up fast.

“It seems like we haven’t seen the sun in a month. I’m gearing myself for four days of rain.”

While disappointed with the weather forecast, Currier said he felt bad for the golfers, too.

“We won’t be the only ones unhappy,” he said. “With temperatures around 65 degrees and a 15-mile-an-hour wind and rain beating on them all day, the golfers probably aren’t going to be having fun, either.”

Currier said clubs from around the New York area had sent volunteer workers and equipment, like squeegees, water pumps that can disperse 700 gallons of water a minute and several devices called water hogs, which act like big sponges on fairways.

Armed with Quinn’s forecast, Currier said his plan for Thursday was to assign two workers with squeegees to every green, another worker on each tee box and 10 to 15 workers in the 18th fairway, which is waterlogged from last weekend’s rain.

The U.S.G.A. said it would not adopt a rule that allows the golfers to lift, clean and replace their ball when it is in the fairway. Such a rule is occasionally agreed to during PGA Tour events when excessive rain has made a course nearly unplayable. Hyler said no U.S.G.A. championship had ever adopted the lift, clean and place guideline.

Thursday may be the rainiest day, Quinn said, and lightning may be the principal concern Saturday.

“It’s going to be wet Thursday,” he said. “Friday, we’ll probably catch a break. Saturday there might be shorter periods of rain, but with lightning. And Sunday? Probably just showers.”

As that forecast circulated around the Bethpage grounds Wednesday, it hardly elicited smiles.

“You would like it to be sunny and dry,” Currier said. “But it’s an outdoor sport. The players are out there for 12 or more hours for four straight days. That’s a long time. So we have to prepare for rain, too. And we have.”
604 2009-06-18 Better yet, Apple intends to give many of those features, and dozens more, to everyone who has ever bought an iPhone.

If you do buy the iPhone 3G S, you get twice the storage — 16 gigabytes — for the same $200 price as before. For $300, you can even buy a 32-gigabyte model, enough to hold the entire “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, the DVD extras and 75 gazillion songs.

You can still buy last year’s model, the iPhone 3G, for $100. But do find a way to afford the new one. It looks identical to last year’s iPhone, but its faster circuitry makes a huge difference. (The S stands for speed, says Apple.) If you’re used to the old iPhone, the speed boost hits you between the eyes, especially when you’re opening programs, playing games and loading Web pages.

The built-in three-megapixel camera is much better, too. The camera still tends to blur moving subjects, and even still lifes aren’t as crisp as from an actual camera. But the color and clarity are definitely improved, especially in low light.

The new autofocus feature lets you tap the screen preview at the spot where you want the exposure, white balance and focus to be calculated. Except when the subject is a few inches away, you don’t see much difference in the focusing — but your tap location can make a big difference in the brightness and color (exposure and white balance) of the finished photo. (You can see sample photos at .)

Better yet, the 3G S now captures video. It’s the real deal: sharp, smooth, 30 frames a second. Once again, it’s not quite what you’d get from a proper digital camera or a Flip camcorder—it tends to “blow out” the bright areas — but it’s darned close.

You can’t beat the capacity, either; in theory, the 32-gigabyte iPhone can capture 17 hours of video — just enough for the elementary-school talent show.

With a fingertip, you can trim the ends of a captured video and then upload it to or MobileMe, right from the phone. (That part, it does much better than a digital camera.)

The new voice-control feature may be the most useful change of all. Hold down the iPhone’s Home button for a moment, say “Call mom’s cell” or “Dial 800-555-1212,” and the iPhone places your call, crisply and accurately. (Yeah, I know: welcome to 2003.) This feature goes a long way toward addressing what’s always been the iPhone’s weakest feature: the number of steps required to place a call.

The iPhone also recognizes spoken commands like “Play songs by ” or “What song is this?”

The new Compass program looks like a classier version of a regular Cub Scout compass — great when you emerge, disoriented, from the subway. In Maps, it adds an indicator beam, showing which way you are facing on the map. No longer must you walk in a circle, staring at the iPhone map like an idiot, just to figure out which way is up.

The iPhone 3G S also gains what Apple calls an oleophobic screen. It may sound like an irrational fear of yodelers, but in fact, it’s a coating that lets you wipe away fingerprints with a single rub on your clothes. It really works to keep the iPhone looking new longer. Maybe fewer people will now bury the iPhone’s gorgeous, slim shape in a homely, bulky case.

Finally, the iPhone 3G S harbors a better, beefier battery, thereby confronting another chronic complaint. It gives you about 25 percent more life a charge (five hours talk time or 30 hours of ), easily enough to last at least a day of moderate use. As Pre owners know, that’s rare on a 3G superphone.

There are dozens more new features on the iPhone 3G S — but the really exciting part is that older iPhones can get them, too. They’re part of a free software upgrade called iPhone 3.0. (You get the upgrade when you sync your phone to iTunes. For $10, the iPod Touch can get this upgrade, too.)

Chief among them: the long-awaited copy and paste commands, which appear at your fingertips when you double-tap text in most programs. Now you can paste text and graphics from a Web site into an e-mail message, for example, or copy an address from a text message into your calendar.

There’s Bluetooth stereo audio, too, meaning that you can listen to your music with cordless headphones, leaving the iPhone itself in your pocket or backpack. (It’s available on the iPhone 3G S, 3G and the current iPod Touch.) A handy voice-recording app comes complete with trim editing and e-mailing commands, thereby turning your iPhone into a high-quality, huge-capacity digital audio recorder.

If you have a MobileMe account ($100 a year), you can also make your iPhone beep for two minutes — and display a plaintive message on the screen — when you’ve misplaced it. How many times have you wished your cellphone had that feature?

The 3.0 software also brings, at last, picture and video messaging (known as MMS) to the iPhone 3G and 3G S — or it will, once AT&T turns on this feature later this summer.

The iPhone app store offers a staggering 50,000 instantly downloadable programs, in every conceivable category; it’s become a crucial reason, maybe the crucial reason, to get an iPhone in the first place. These programs are getting very sophisticated indeed.

Documents to Go ($5) lets you create and edit Word documents right on the iPhone, for example; programs like Gokivo and TomTom will bring real, spoken, turn-by-turn GPS navigation to the iPhone.

But the more fun you have trying out these apps, the more desperately you need a way to manage them. After all, the iPhone can now hold 176 apps on 11 side-by-side Home screens.

Therefore, the new universal-search feature could not arrive at a better time. Type a few characters, and up pops a list of every match in your calendar, address book, notes, music stash, e-mail headers (subject, to/from, and first few body lines) — and apps. That’s right: you can now call up a program by typing a bit of its name.

All of these changes make it much harder to resist the iPhone on intellectual, feature-counting grounds. The new iPhone doesn’t just catch up to its rivals — it vaults a year ahead of them.

At this point, the usual 10 rational objections to the iPhone have been whittled down to about three: no physical keyboard, no way to swap the battery yourself and no way to avoid using AT&T as your carrier.

In short, the substantially improved, still elegant iPhone 3G S makes it dangerously easy for your heart and your head to agree.
605 2009-06-18 Banks worth $1 billion to $5 billion have twice as much exposure to those loans as financial institutions worth $100 billion or more, according to data from Tony Davis, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “Those are huge numbers,” Mr. Davis said.

They are part of the reason why many regional banks are also more likely than larger institutions to hold onto their government lifelines for the foreseeable future.

The 19 large financial institutions that went through the government’s stress tests have already raised, according to Thomson Reuters, $50.9 billion in stock offerings since May 7, when regulators detailed the results of their assessments. The hundreds of other banks that received bailout funds but were not stress-tested have raised a total of only $1.8 billion in stock offerings.

For some, that could mean that they do not have a large enough capital cushion to repay their investment from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. And while the shares of big banks that passed the stress tests, like Goldman Sachs, have risen since the results were released, the KBW Regional Bank Index, a gauge of 50 banks, has fallen 17 percent over the same period.

In Michigan, where the unemployment rate has climbed to 14.1 percent — the highest in the nation — the struggling Citizens Republic Bancorp is in no rush to repay its $300 million federal bailout. The bank has lost $240 million in the last two quarters, and though it has strengthened its reserves and increased its liquidity, it still faces more losses and weak loan demand.

“Being in Michigan, it’s very prudent for us to continue to work through the economic conditions in that marketplace and not try to rush any repayment of TARP until we know we’re out of the financial crisis,” said Charles D. Christy, the chief financial officer. “Once we get out of the financial crisis, then we’ll do what we need to do to pay back the TARP.”

Citizens Republic was one of the five banks downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s. In addition to cutting ratings at smaller banks, analysts downgraded Wells Fargo and two banks that repaid their bailout money, BB&T and U.S. Bancorp.

In their report, the analysts said they expected tougher operating conditions for banks, greater loan losses and more volatility in financial markets. Total charge-offs on bank loans were running at 1.94 percent in the first quarter of the year, a near record, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Analysts have said that dozens of weaker lenders were likely to close down over the rest of the year.

“We believe some firms may be better able to weather the risks ahead than others,” Rodrigo Quintanilla, a credit analyst for S.& P., said in the report. “In the long term, we could foresee ourselves raising ratings if lower earnings and reduced risk are accompanied by stronger risk-adjusted capital and effective governance.”

Investors are growing wary, too. Shares of KeyCorp, Regions Financial and Fifth Third Bank all fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday.

Citizens Republic fell 16 percent on the downgrade, which Mr. Christy blamed in part on Michigan’s dire economy.

“A lot of these regionals have been beaten up,” said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “They ran too fast, too far.”
606 2009-06-18 Despite rising gasoline prices, overall retail prices in the United States barely budged in May, the government reported on Wednesday.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in April. The index measures how much consumers spend on an array of goods and services, and is considered a gauge of inflation in the economy.

As the government borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to finance its bailouts and lending programs, some investors have grown leery about inflation. Prices of commodities like gold, copper and crude oil have climbed, and interest rates on government bonds have risen to their highest levels in five months, reflecting concern that prices were rising.

Some investors even speculated that the Federal Reserve might need to raise its target interest rates, which are currently near zero. But Fed governors have given no indication that they would raise rates anytime soon.

Economists pointed to Wednesday’s numbers as a sign that there was still widespread downward pressure on prices, even if federal debts were growing. Wage growth is slowing, unemployment is rising, consumer demand remains low and many industries are still running at partial capacity.

“Slack is headed to near unprecedented territory here,” a United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, Haseeb Ahmed, said. “If wages are falling, do you really expect people to believe inflation’s going to go through the roof next year?”
607 2009-06-18 Investors took in economic information from all sides on Wednesday, and traders found new reasons to worry in a warning from FedEx and a downgrade of 22 banks. Trading reflected those concerns, with shares moving in a narrow range.

FedEx said its fourth-quarter loss widened because of hefty one-time charges and lower revenue, though its results, stripping out those costs, came in above expectations. The company warned that it expected “extremely difficult” conditions in the next two quarters.

Financial stocks experienced some losses after Standard & Poor’s cut ratings and revised outlooks on 22 banks. S.& P. said the changes reflected its assessment that volatility would remain in the financial sector and the industry is expected to face tighter regulatory oversight. The agency also said loan losses, which have plagued the industry for more than a year, would probably continue to increase and could grow beyond expectations.

The BB&T Corporation, Capital One Financial, the Regions Financial Corporation and Wells Fargo & Company were among the largest banks whose ratings were cut.

At the same time, 10 large banks — including JPMorgan Chase, the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley — began to repay the government about $68 billion in bailout money.

627 2009-06-19 “But what we really want to do is get enough traction in the African-American community with the young people so that they can learn something from this, and also be motivated to want to be part of our great game of baseball,” Solomon said.

The first two games were exhibitions played in Memphis, Tenn., home of the National Civil Rights Museum. When baseball decided to make the game part of the regular season, Solomon said the Freedom Center, which opened nearly five years ago a short walk from the Reds’ Great American Ball Park, was a decisive factor in Cincinnati’s successful push.

“I feel honored and privileged that my team and my city were chosen to host this,” said Dusty Baker, the Reds’ first black manager. He said the event is bringing “guys that have been leaders in the civil rights movement and really, leaders in the world.”

Ali, Aaron and Cosby will be honored at a Saturday luncheon with Clinton as the keynote speaker and Leonard, Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson and Commissioner Bud Selig presenting them with baseball’s Beacon Awards.

Frank Robinson, who was the major leagues’ first black manager, will throw out the first pitch Saturday night. Another former Reds star and Hall of Famer, Tony Perez, and Robertson will participate in a round-table discussion Friday at the Freedom Center.

Current Reds Brandon Phillips and Jerry Hairston Jr. and the former All-Stars Eric Davis and Harold Reynolds will take part Saturday in baseball demonstrations and activities called “Wanna Play?,” MLB’s latest initiative to revitalize black participation that had been on the decline over the past two decades.

“I’ve seen improvement in race relations in baseball and in the world, but I’ve also seen a decline in race representation,” said Baker, who was a rookie with the Atlanta Braves in 1968. “This game will contribute to fixing that, hopefully, along with programs like RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities). Everybody’s trying, but it’s not going to happen overnight.”

Solomon noted signs of progress in the latest report by Richard Lapchick, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports. The report found that 10.2 percent of major leaguers last year were black, the most since 1995.

Solomon said baseball hopes to raise the profiles of its black players compared to N.B.A. and N.F.L. stars.

“If you took LeBron James into a restaurant, virtually every kid in the restaurant would know who he is,” Solomon said. “You take a Ryan Howard or Jimmy Rollins to the same restaurant and many kids would not who they were — unless you were in Philadelphia.”

Solomon said baseball also wants to draw attention to its role in civil rights, pointing out that Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color line in 1947 in a major step for integration in America.

Blending educational outreach with history “dovetails precisely with our overall mission,” said Paul Bernish, spokesman for the Freedom Center.

The center, whose attendance sagged after its first year, has a joint promotion with the Reds’ Hall of Fame. Both have Negro Leagues exhibits, while the Reds have a special exhibit on Crosley Field, their home when the team integrated.
628 2009-06-19 “I’d rather tell our brand story, our innovation story, our value story, than join the chorus of everyone else that’s screaming ‘sale’ — that’s about the only message that’s out there right now,” Mr. Cannon said. “Customers have told us, ‘we know there are deals out there,’ so just getting on television with an expensive media plan and shouting, ‘there’s a sale,’ they already know that.”

The television spots will begin running on Monday. One starts with scenes of families admiring classic Mercedes cars and trucks at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany. These are interspersed with scenes of a coupe driving along a forested road. At the end, the car bursts through the museum’s glass wall and spins into place alongside the other Mercedes cars. “Taking its rightful place in a long line of amazing performance machines,” the narrator says.

A television commercial for the sedan highlights new technology in the cars, like “attention assist,” which helps alert sleepy drivers, and an automatic braking system that kicks in when a driver loses concentration and is about to hit something. The narrator promotes the E-Class as “the future of the automobile.”

Although Mercedes wanted to avoid emphasizing sale prices, it did place the starting price for the cars at the end of each television spot and in the print ads. At $48,600, it is almost 9 percent less than the starting price for the last set of E-Class cars, from the 2003 model year. The ads give just the price, though, not the discount. “For Mercedes-Benz customers, $48,600 is a huge value story, and those people know it, so I don’t have to go out and say, ‘value, value’ — that’s not appropriate for our brand,” Mr. Cannon said. “The folks that are looking for a midsize luxury sedan kind of understand the price points.”

The television ads will run in two phases: the one that starts Monday will run through July. The ads will resume in September, with the television networks’ season premieres. The ads will run on networks like Bravo and CNN and during news programs. Print ads will soon run in magazines like Architectural Digest, Golf Digest and Tennis. The online advertising, designed by Razorfish, a unit of Microsoft, includes home page advertisements on sites like Bloomberg.com and CNBC.com.

For his customers, “I think there’s a level of crisis fatigue and recession fatigue out there, marketing down to, ‘we feel your pain. We’re all in this together,’ versus, ‘this is who we are,’ ” Mr. Cannon said. “All the things that mattered to them before the recession, it still matters to them. But we have to work harder to break through, because the system has been shocked significantly.”
629 2009-06-19 LONDON — Under fire for impaneling an inquiry into the Iraq war that many critics condemned as a “whitewash” before the panel could convene for the first time, Prime Minister Gordon Brown reversed course on Thursday and said it could hold at least some hearings in public and could take some testimony under oath.

The furor is the latest in a catalog of embarrassments that have been deeply damaging to the Labor government and Mr. Brown, who narrowly survived a cabinet revolt just this month. For many critics, the issue underlying many of the perceived missteps has been the quality of Mr. Brown’s judgment, especially on issues he judges as likely to affect Labor’s election prospects next year.

The latest imbroglio was touched off by Mr. Brown’s move earlier this week to redeem a longstanding pledge by creating an investigative panel to look into British military involvement in Iraq, now that Britain’s last major military units are set to withdraw by July 30. The issue weighs heavily on Labor, since it was in power, under former Prime Minister Tony Blair, when the decision to join the United States in the 2003 invasion was made. But Mr. Brown’s restrictive provisions for the inquiry prompted wide condemnation among those who pressed for the inquiry, including relatives of the 179 British service personnel members who died in Iraq.

The outcry has come, too, from all parties in the House of Commons, from newspaper editorials and from powerful establishment voices, including a retired military commander, Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, who oversaw Britain’s operations in Iraq as army chief in 2003. He said Thursday that the inquiry “must be open wherever possible” to ensure lessons are learned for future military operations. A similar view was articulated by Sir John Major, a former Conservative prime minister. “If the purpose of the inquiry is to settle doubts that people have had for so long, then it defies logic to hold it in private,” Sir John Major said.

A common view has been that Mr. Brown, facing an election within 12 months, set out to limit the inquiry’s potential for damaging Labor, which trails the opposition Conservatives badly in public opinion polls. In announcing the inquiry on Monday, he said it would hold its hearings behind closed doors and would not “apportion blame.” The panel would not be empowered to take testimony under oath and would not report for 12 months, putting its findings beyond the election.
630 2009-06-19 CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors are trying to determine if former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich and his allies used political muscle to influence student admissions at three state universities.

United States Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald issued subpoenas this week seeking admissions office records from the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University. The request was related to Mr. Blagojevich and three of his co-defendants on criminal corruption charges, William Cellini, Christopher Kelly and Alonzo Monk.

The investigation also seeks records related to Antoin Rezko, a Chicago businessman and political operative, who last June was convicted of fraud and bribery.

The federal investigation, seeking records from 2002 to 2008, was begun a week after Gov. Patrick J. Quinn appointed a panel to investigate accusations that hundreds of students at the University of Illinois had been admitted because of their families’ political connections.

“The governor is aware of the situation at the University of Illinois, and that is why he formed the Admissions Review Commission,” said Robert Reed, a spokesman for the governor.

The Chicago Tribune has reported that as many as 800 applicants to the university had been admitted because of political patronage.

“I don’t think this federal investigation is greatly different from what the commission is doing,” said a University of Illinois spokesman, Thomas Hardy, “but we will look to see what documents fall under this subject, and provide them to the U.S. attorney’s office.”
631 2009-06-19 But credit card terms have worsened sharply with the recession: three-quarters of small business said they have seen a large cut in limits over the last six months. That would not be so bad if other forms of credit were easily accessible. But banks and credit card companies, which opened their coffers when the economy was flourishing, are now pulling back from nearly everything that hints of risk.

“I’m a business in a bad time that wants to expand,” said Mr. Licata, who added that he had been unable to get loans at Cleveland’s banks since the recession set in. Recently, the limit on three of the credit cards he uses for his law firm was slashed by a total of $60,000, he said, dousing plans to enlarge his business.

Of course, consumers have been squeezed by higher interest rates and reduced credit lines by credit card companies, too. But small businesses were not included in the credit card reform legislation signed into law last month by , which limits excessive fees and interest rate increases on existing balances starting next year. A bipartisan coalition of senators is seeking to extend the legislation to small business.

“The way that the economy is going to come out of a recession is not by big business hiring but by small business hiring,” said Senator , Democrat of , who is championing the measure. Denying small businesses access to credit is having “spiraling” effect on the economy, she added.

Bankers say that credit card companies have no choice but to reduce credit to small businesses. Credit card delinquency among small-business owners is more than 12 percent, roughly two percentage points higher than credit card charge-offs among consumers, according to Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report.

Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president of card policy for the American Bankers Association, said applying the credit card reform law to small businesses would further crimp credit, since it would limit credit card companies’ ability to manage risk. Already, he said, the companies have had to restrict credit to small businesses because of rising defaults and uncertainty.

“They are looking very closely at the ability of small business to pay them back,” he said. “They have to. They have no choice.”

Tom Sclafani, a spokesman for , said credit lines offered when the economy was booming might not be appropriate when growth contracts. The company has been cutting credit lines based in part on the overall debt level of the business.

“What we are trying to do is strike a balance between a customer’s spending needs and managing credit risk,” he said.

American Express offered the first credit card tailored to small business 20 years ago. Other companies came onto the playing field over the last decade, when a healthy economy turned small businesses into a lucrative source of new accounts as the consumer market became saturated.

Credit card companies became increasingly aggressive in soliciting new business. Many banks began offering their own credit cards to small businesses, in lieu of loans. And many small vendors began preferring, or even requiring, payments with credit cards.

Where small businesses had traditionally relied on bank loans, personal savings or relatives to help pay for their operations, credit cards provided additional flexibility and ease. Low introductory offers and rewards programs were icing on the cake.

The market grew so rapidly that at least one company, -based Advanta, decided to focus exclusively on credit cards for small-business customers. By 2006, just five years after it was founded, its profit from business credit cards surged 54 percent over the previous year. Eventually, more than one million small businesses took an Advanta card.

Then the economy went into a tailspin, and took Advanta’s fortunes with it. The company last month announced that it would no longer pay for additional purchases, leaving many customers in a bind.

Now, small businesses “are really having to scramble because often they don’t have the kind of flexibility they had before,” said Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association. Further, of small businesses have been hurt as banks cut credit limits, making it even harder to get other types of credit.

“It feeds on itself,” he said.

Mr. Allen, the owner of the financial and marketing firm in , said he recently took some insurance agents on an where he tried to charge drinks and several side trips on his credit card, only to be denied. To his astonishment, his limit had been cut with no notice.

After he returned to Ohio, Mr. Allen said he met some clients for dinner. Normally, he said he would have whipped out a credit card to pay the bill. Instead, he paid in cash. Mr. Allen said he has also scaled back travel because credit was tight and business was slower than normal.

“You’ve got to play a balancing act,” Mr. Allen said. “This is going to be a moving target.”

Mrs. Macone, the owner of the business in Florida selling equestrian-themed trinkets and home décor to retail outlets, said she had to retool her business in part because the credit lines on her cards were suddenly slashed, even though she maintained she paid her bills on time. Traditionally, she has relied on her credit cards to purchase inventory, which she then paid off as her customers settled their accounts.

But last fall, Ms. Macone, who took out a credit card with Advanta, opened her bill to find the company had raised her interest rate above 30 percent. A short time later, Advanta reduced her spending limit from $30,000 to $5,000. “When you have a business, it’s like, ‘$5,000? Please, what good is that?’ ”

Advanta said it was responding to worsening conditions. “Across the card industry, card issuers have been increasing interest rates and reducing credit lines to protect themselves against a riskier economic environment,” said Amy Holderer, a spokeswoman. “We are no different.”

Ms. Macone said she has had to lay off three part-time workers who used to assemble orders for shipment in her warehouse, and cut the hours of two other employees. “I’m the warehouse help now — my husband and I,” she said. “I’m back out there picking orders. I haven’t picked orders in 10 years.”
632 2009-06-19 INWOOD SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL The West Side of Manhattan is probably the most fertile Shakespearean stomping ground in the city this summer. Starting way up north, this company, celebrating its 10th anniversary, will take over the Inwood Hill Park Peninsula, presenting “The Merchant of Venice,” through Saturday (moosehallisf.org).

NEW YORK CLASSICAL THEATER A bit farther south the aforementioned “King Lear” runs first in Central Park at West 103rd Street, through Sunday, and then at Castle Clinton in Battery Park, June 23 to July 7 (newyorkclassical.org).HUDSON WAREHOUSE On the North Patio of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument at West 89th Street and Riverside Drive the company that bills itself on its Web site as “the other free Shakespeare in the Park” will present a three-show season of “The Tempest” (through June 28), “Hamlet” (July 9 to Aug. 2) and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (Aug. 6 to 30; hudsonwarehouse.net).

BOOMERANG THEATER Starting Saturday theatergoers in search of “Comedy of Errors” can find a free production by entering Central Park at 69th Street and Central Park West (through July 19; boomerangtheatre.org).

SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARKING LOT Outdoor Shakespeare need not happen only in idyllic settings; enterprising actors will perform anywhere they can attract an audience. In a lot at the corner of Ludlow and Broome Streets on the Lower East Side the Drilling Company will present “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (July 9 to 25) and “Measure for Measure” (July 30 to Aug. 15) with actors finding whatever space they can among the cars (shakespeareintheparkinglot.com).

THEATERSMARTS Maura Kelly has exchanged Shakespeare’s military men for baseball players in an adaptation of “Much Ado About Nothing” under the auspices of this young company. The show has recently been presented in several parks including Socrates Sculpture Garden and Astoria Park in Queens, and has forthcoming shows scheduled, through June 28, at Marcus Garvey and St. Nicholas Parks in Harlem and at Red Hook Park in Brooklyn (theatersmarts.com).

PIPER THEATER PRODUCTIONS Taking up residence at the Old Stone House in Park Slope, Brooklyn, tucked into J. J. Byrne Park (at Fifth Avenue between Third and Fourth Streets), this crew will offer its interpretation of “Hamlet” (July 9 to 26) and also the Tom Stoppard comedy it inspired: “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” on three Sundays only, July 12, 19 and 26 (pipertheatre.org).

CONTINUUM COMPANY In Herbert Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, this company, made up of alumni from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, is doing an 85-minute version of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” with five actors playing all of the parts (July 24 to 25) and will also present the show in Manhattan at Marcus Garvey Park (July 31 to Aug. 1) and East River Park (Aug. 4) (cityparksfoundation.org).

HIP TO HIP THEATER COMPANY This Queens company will offer both a comedy and a tragedy this summer, the company’s third. A week of “Midsummer Night’s Dream” (Aug. 11 to 16) will be followed by a week of “Romeo & Juliet” (Aug. 18 to 23), both presented in several parks in the borough, including Fort Totten and Crocheron Park (hiptohip.org).

Outdoor Shakespeare is somewhat ubiquitous in New York each year, and plays have been known to pop up in Tompkins Square Park, Washington Square Park and other places, usually free. Some companies pass a hat after the show, but by then you will have either wandered off or been happily entertained and thus willing to cough up a few bucks.
633 2009-06-19 The cultural desire to know what is wrong immediately is another cause of higher costs. Immediacy requires myriad tests and imaging done quickly. Careful observation for a time can be just as effective, safer and less costly. Another prerequisite for lowering costs is for our national culture to develop some patience.

The writer, a medical doctor, is a professor of pharmacology, medicine and public health at Weill Cornell Medical College.

“Doctors and the Cost of Care” (editorial, June 14) unfairly blames “profligate physician behavior” for high medical spending in the United States. Contrary to what the Dartmouth researchers claimed, regions with high Medicare per capita spending are not necessarily wasting money.

Medicare spending per capita is an inaccurate proxy for overall medical spending. Atul Gawande, in his New Yorker article cited in the editorial, relies on the Dartmouth Medicare data to identify McAllen, Tex., as the town with the highest per capita medical spending next to Miami.

But there are reasons other than physician behavior that explain Medicare costs in McAllen. It is a border town and cares for many newcomers who are uninsured and can’t pay. Therefore costs are shifted to insurance programs like Medicare.

In addition, to the extent actual medical spending per capita is high in McAllen, Dr. Gawande points out other reasons. McAllen’s population drinks 60 percent more than average and has a 38 percent obesity rate.

Most doctors put their patients first, and many doctors provide free treatment when a patient cannot pay. What a shame doctors are being vilified in the name of reform. Betsy McCaughey

 New York, June 15, 2009

The writer is chairwoman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and a former lieutenant governor of New York State.

I was disturbed to see your editorial suggest that the blame for “ever rising premiums” falls primarily on physicians. Let’s give credit where credit is due.

Between 2000 and 2007, the 10 largest publicly traded insurance companies increased their profits 428 percent, from $2.4 billion to $12.9 billion, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

During the same period, the number of insurers fell by nearly 20 percent, largely because of a huge wave of mergers that led to stunning consolidation. And premiums increased by more than 87 percent, rising four times faster than the average American’s wages.

Today, 95 percent of American insurance markets qualify as tight oligopolies. As in so many industries, blind reliance on free-market forces has failed the American public.

Clearly, doctors bear a responsibility to curb costs. But the real culprits are the middlemen who, after years of lax regulation, now have such a tight grip on the market that they can — and do — charge whatever they want.

Since its founding, Mayo Clinic has paid physicians with salaries to avoid financial conflicts of interest in clinical decision-making, and to promote multi-disciplinary coordination of care. Less well known, but important to Mayo’s early growth, was its principle of billing based on patients’ means.

Using a sliding scale, wealthier patients paid more than poorer patients did for the same care. Such means adjustment increased patient volumes, which strengthened Mayo’s expertise and efficiency, benefiting rich and poor alike.

Health reform warrants similar means-adjustment principles. Consumer-owned cooperatives could buy high-deductible, low-premium insurance policies, and pay below-deductible bills, using means-adjusted withdrawals from participants’ health savings accounts. Such a plan would improve outcomes and value more effectively than bureaucratic price-setting would.

634 2009-06-19 “It’s not tennis and it’s not baseball,” said Larry Botel, who spent the day in a corporate tent and never got out on the course.

“It was dry inside,” said his friend Steve Klein of New York.

“Except for the alcohol,” said another friend, Steve Strauss of Montvale, N.J.

The three friends were dry and sober late in the day, but more than a few fans seemed to have found a drink or two out on the course.

The fans came from all over the world, knowing that on any given day play could be more or less washed out. Guy and Augustana Otobo flew in from Lagos, Nigeria, after a lucky hit on the Internet allowed them to buy tickets for all four days.

“I don’t feel bad at all,” Guy Otobo, a civil engineer, said about the washout. He did not blame officials for starting in the rain and then making fans wait for hours until calling it off shortly before 2 p.m. “It’s not the fault of the Open,” he added. Otobo and his wife, a lawyer, were satisfied seeing a few good shots on the back nine. Since they have tickets for the next three days, they can take the long view.

The Hurd family from Albany, however, was done. The three men drove down Wednesday evening, stayed in a motel in Queens, and saw a few good shots out of a sand trap on the fifth hole.

“That’s my Open experience,” said Garry Hurd, brother of Mike, uncle of 14-year-old Eric. Mike thought the Open officials could have kept them better informed, and could do better by the fans when play is suspended early, but he did not have an easy solution. All he knew was that they were heading back upstate.

The fans had done their best to see one of the great events of their sport, rushing onto the Black Course at Bethpage to congregate at the first hole at about 8 a.m., to get a glimpse of Tiger Woods. Anybody caught inside the crush of humanity and umbrellas knew something bad had transpired from the mass sigh: Woods hooked his first drive far off the fairway and the air went out of the crowd in one long syllable: “AWWWwww!”

At least the foul weather held down the hordes that normally follow Woods around the course. Sometimes fans have to space out their Tiger watching, rushing one hole ahead to find a reasonable vantage point, but one man and his young son caught up to the seventh green just as his Tigership approached. The man said he had been able to at least glimpse Woods on every hole so far, but then his luck ran out, because play was suspended, and it was never resumed.

One thing I learned was that golf in the rain is far from a pantywaist activity. The golfers must hit a ball with rain lashing into their faces, and the fans also have physical challenges. Anytime a fan turned to follow the ball, there was the very real chance he could poke out somebody’s eye with his umbrella.

Dodging other people’s umbrellas could be a Summer Games event, and keeping one’s equilibrium on the muddy slopes could be a Winter Games activity. Fans looked like Eddie the Eagle, the notoriously clumsy English ski jumper, as they spread their arms wide and tried to keep from tumbling down the grassy hillsides. One fan unintentionally performed a hook slide, like Jackie Robinson coming into third, muddying his pants from ankle to hip. Safe!

On the trek back to the clubhouse, one could see creeks running downhill on several fairways. Nature was asserting herself on this land that had been temporarily disfigured by greens and sand traps and portable toilets. Nature was doing her best to revert to the eons when pterodactyls or mastodons or seagulls roamed Long Island. Nature was driving away these silly creatures with their umbrellas, making them trudge back toward their belching buses. On the first day of the United States Open, nature won.
635 2009-06-19 Swiss financial regulators said Thursday that they were considering assuming new emergency powers that would allow them to break up large banks to wind down troubled business units that are not essential to the economy.

The Swiss National Bank, in its 2009 financial stability report, said it wanted to develop a better approach than bailouts to deal with crises at big banks whose collapse would threaten the whole financial system.

“There can be no more taboos, given our experiences of the last two years,” Philipp Hildebrand, the vice chairman of the bank, said in Berne, Switzerland. Swiss authorities, including the central bank and the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, signaled an aggressive approach to the “too big to fail” problem that has vexed policy makers in Europe and the United States.

Switzerland is home to two such banks, UBS and Credit Suisse. UBS, hit hard by bad investments linked to the mortgage market in the United States, has received a government bailout. Credit Suisse has also had losses, but arranged a recapitalization through private other sources.

The quandary, highlighted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year, is that letting banks fail as a result of their mistakes can strangle companies and consumers not directly involved in banking.
636 2009-06-19 The United Nations Human Rights Council voted Thursday to continue its close scrutiny of the situation in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan against the wishes of the African country and its allies on the 47-member body. The decision effectively continues the post of the United Nations special rapporteur on Sudan that was created in 1993.
637 2009-06-19 The Israeli writer Etgar Keret possesses an imagination not easily slotted into conventional literary categories. His very short stories might be described as Kafkaesque parables, magic-realist knock-knock jokes or sad kernels of cracked cosmic wisdom. When such vignettes are strung together into a feature — as in “Jellyfish” (2007), which he directed with his wife, Shira Geffen, and now in Tatia Rosenthal’s “$9.99” — they become even more elusive and strange. To watch these films is to enter an eerily realistic parallel universe where people and emotions are at once perfectly recognizable and completely bizarre.

This effect is doubled by the extraordinary technique used in “$9.99” to bring Mr. Keret’s world to life. Ms. Rosenthal, an Israeli animator, has cast some of Australia’s finest actors, including well-known performers like Geoffrey Rush and Anthony LaPaglia, to provide voices for figures made of modeling clay. The gestures and expressions of these handmade citizens of a meticulously realized city are given more poignancy by the slight hesitancy imposed by stop-motion animation. They seem to be pausing to think before each action or utterance, even when they are being rash, heedless or irrational.

And the environment around them is dense with meaning and full of life. Both large structures — parks, buildings, streetscapes and rooms — and tiny objects like bottle caps and coins have been modeled with exquisite, almost compulsive care. Indeed, Ms. Rosenthal’s work is so scrupulous and unassuming that after a while you might begin to take it for granted and to allow astonishment at the film’s visual texture to give way to impatience with its story.

And impatience may be among the responses that Mr. Keret, who wrote the screenplay, intends. His work proceeds from the recognition that life is tedious and confusing as well as, occasionally, charmed. And the characters who populate the daisy-chain narrative of “$9.99” — one of those we’re-all-vaguely-connected-by-a-vague-metaphysical-condition “Babel”-“Crash” movies — are in various funks and malaises or else just out of sorts.

Among them are a calmly sinister homeless man (Mr. Rush), who turns into a grumpy and sarcastic angel; a put-upon businessman (Mr. LaPaglia) with two grown sons, one dating a model and the other hoping to discover the meaning of life with mail-order self-help books; a young boy who bonds with his piggy bank; and a guy visited, in the wake of his girlfriend’s departure, by three thimble-size, obnoxious surfer dudes.

An aura of dreamy melancholy, accentuated by Christopher Bowen’s musical score, pervades the entwined stories, which treat the bizarre and the banal as sides of the same coin. But though “$9.99” manages to be quirky and enigmatic, it is in the end too self-conscious, too satisfied in its eccentricity, to achieve the full mysteriousness toward which it seems to aspire. It is odd, curious, intermittently intriguing but ultimately more interesting for its artifice than for its art.

638 2009-06-19 MOSCOW — Gazprom, the energy company, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Dow Chemical Company to expand trading in carbon dioxide emission credits intended to slow climate change, a business that is a growing sideline for the Russian company.

Best known for its sales of natural gas and crude oil, which produce heat-trapping carbon dioxide, Gazprom is an emerging player in the market for credits that companies can buy or trade to comply with national or international rules on greenhouse gas emissions.

Under the memorandum, Gazprom and Dow agreed to look at opportunities where Dow technologies could be used to reduce carbon emissions, thus generating the emission credits. The companies agreed to look at opportunities worldwide.

Dow could then use some of the credits to offset its own industrial activities while Gazprom’s trading arm in Britain could market any excess.

Gazprom’s customers in Europe — in particular utilities that burn gas to generate electricity — often need to offset their emissions under a European Union pollution trading scheme or the broader Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
639 2009-06-19 As for the Federal Reserve’s role, Mr. Dodd described himself as “open on the issue.” But, borrowing a quote from an economics professor, he went on to wonder aloud if giving the Federal Reserve more authority “is like a parent giving his son a bigger, faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon.”

The panel’s ranking Republican, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, said he did not want to allow the administration’s recommendations “to limit the debate we are about to undertake.” And while agreeing that the present regulatory setup is antiquated and inadequate, Mr. Shelby said he thought the Federal Reserve already had enough to do, with a lot of responsibilities that “conflict at times.”

Mr. Geithner tried to knock down any impression that the Federal Reserve would become much more powerful. “Our proposals for the additional authority we’re giving the Fed are actually quite modest and build on their existing authority,” he said.

Moreover, he said, the Fed was not responsible for the current situation, and “it has a greater knowledge and feel for broader market developments than is true for any other entity in that context.”

Mr. Geithner is sure to face more sharp questioning. He was to have appeared Thursday afternoon before the House Financial Services Committee, but the session was postponed because of heavy House business on the floor.

At least twice, Mr. Geithner described the White House plan as “pragmatic” and meant to do what is essential, rather than what would be ideal. “It does not propose reforms that, while desirable, would not move us toward achieving those core objectives and creating a more stable system.”

But Democrats and Republicans alike voiced skepticism, if not outright hostility. For instance, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said he shared his colleagues’ concerns about the administration’s blueprint, including “this expansion of authority within the Fed.”

Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, was almost disdainful. “Your plan puts a lot of faith in the Federal Reserve’s ability to spot risk and exercise its power to prevent the next crisis,” he told Mr. Geithner. “If the Fed and other regulators had been doing their jobs and paying attention to what the banks and other firms were doing earlier this decade, they almost certainly could have prevented the mess.”

Aware that some legislators have suggested that a council of regulators, not a single agency, might be better for overseeing large institutions, Mr. Geithner said in his opening remarks that “you cannot convene a committee to put out a fire.”

The administration’s proposal for a new agency to protect consumers in their banking transactions was more warmly received. Mr. Dodd applauded the idea and lashed out at banking interests who have already criticized it, saying that the people who created the mess “are the ones now arguing that consumers ought not to be protected,” he said.

Mr. Geithner alluded to one element of the recent, and still not entirely resolved, financial crisis that has caused particular anger among the public. From now on, he said, “no one should assume that the government will step in to bail them out if their firm fails.”

An intriguing question was posed by Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. If the regulatory setup the administration is advocating had been in place not many months ago, would things be different now?

Such “what if” questions are ultimately unanswerable, of course, but Mr. Geithner tried anyhow.

“Banks would not have taken on so much risk,” he said. “Institutions that were not regulated banks would not have been permitted to take on that level of risk; consumers would have been less vulnerable to the kind of predation we saw, particularly in mortgage markets.”

And Washington, he said, “would have had the ability to act earlier, more swiftly to contain the damage posed by the inevitable pressures that come when firms fail.”
640 2009-06-19 “It’s an obscene amount of money to pay for this,” Nelson said. “Like most people and corporations, they are doing this because they can.”

3 PARKING LOTS CLOSE Three parking lots at Bethpage State Park — D, F and R — will be closed for the rest of the tournament because of the rain, the United States Golf Association said.

Fans with parking passes for lots D and F and volunteers with passes for lot R should go to general spectator parking areas at Jones Beach, where they can use complimentary shuttle buses to Bethpage. General spectator shuttles begin at 5:30 a.m.

RESALES SINK The fans who did manage to slog around Bethpage Black on Thursday are not the only ones having potential ticket problems. Apparently, people trying to resell their tickets to Sunday’s championship round are, too.

According to FanSnap.com, a Web site that monitors nearly five dozen ticket resellers, the average price of a ticket being offered for sale to Sunday’s play, which for now is the final round, had fallen by 40 percent.

Of the roughly 400 Sunday tickets for sale online Thursday, the average price had fallen to $128.15. Prices have fallen steadily since early April, when the average price hit a high of $220.

Every day of the tournament, 42,500 fans are allowed on the course. Some fans buy weeklong passes; others buy tickets for individual days. Tickets to championship rounds have a face value of $100, although tickets with access to premium clubs cost more.

The steady decline in prices leading up to Sunday’s round is not unusual for a single event like a golf tournament, said Michael Janes, FanSnap’s chief executive. The first fans who try to sell their tickets aim high and then lower their offers as the event nears.

But “versus some of the storied tournaments in recent years, the prices are substantially lower, and you have to chalk that up to the economy,” said Janes, who added that tickets to the Masters in April followed the same pattern.

Janes said buyers play a game of chicken with sellers as an event approaches, with buyers hoping that sellers panic and lower their prices. That could happen if rain forces the United States Golf Association to push the final round back to Monday or even Tuesday, when many ticket holders would have to go to work and be unable to attend.

BRIGHT RETURN Andrew Parr of Canada, who joked that his first name should be Under, was one of four players tied for the lead at one-under par when first-round play was suspended. For Parr, 26, playing in his first United States Open, the weather could not have been finer.

“There were no problems out there for me,” he said with a smile inside the Bethpage clubhouse. “I had a great golf day. Who cares about a rainy day? I was playing in the U.S. Open.”

Parr’s mood was brightened given recent circumstances in his life, which included having a stroke that left his right side paralyzed less than two years ago. A small hole in Parr’s heart allowed a clot to travel to his brain.

“It came out of nowhere, and I couldn’t speak and my whole right side was paralyzed,” Parr said. “You wonder what’s happening to you, and I certainly wondered if I’d ever play golf again.”

So when Parr found himself on the first tee at the Bethpage Black course Thursday, he hardly focused on the incessant rain.

“I was kind of in my own fog, kind of like I was asleep and dreaming,” he said. “They were calling my name on the tee, and I don’t even remember hitting the ball. But I crushed it down the middle and hit a 9-iron to about four feet.”

That led to a birdie. Two pars followed, and then play was suspended. Parr’s name was on the giant leader board overlooking the 18th green as he walked off the course, a scene his friends from London, Ontario, made sure to capture with cameras

After his stroke, Parr spent about a week in the hospital. He was told about Tedy Bruschi, a New England Patriots linebacker who had come back from something similar to play again in the N.F.L. Parr was back on the course a month later, against the advice of his doctors.

“I was still pretty off balance,” Parr said. “But after about six months of rehab — hard work and retraining the brain — I was pretty much O.K. I could run again and had full energy to work out and make it through the day.”

Parr said his illness had helped his game. “When I hit bad shots on the golf course, I don’t worry about them much,” he said. “I now feel that if I could recover from a stroke, I can recover from anything.”

Unlike many of the golfers Thursday, Parr did not seem wet or waterlogged. “I didn’t see any miserable weather out there,” he said brightly. “Nothing was miserable.” BILL PENNINGTON

VIRTUAL GOLF At one tent, the American Express Championship Experience, there is a booth where you can putt on artificial turf guaranteed to roll at 13 on the Stimpmeter, which is fast but not as fast as the United States Golf Association would like to see on the real grass.

You can also undergo a rapid-fire swing analysis, which is sort of like a simultaneous cardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging exam. You put on a harness wired to a computer, take a single swing, whacking a golf ball at a Bethpage backdrop, and a week later a swing doctor will send you a diagnosis by e-mail.

Next door, at the Lexus Perfect Drive booth, you can also hit at a backdrop, a replica of a Bethpage par-3, while the computer keeps track of who lands closest to the hole. No free car if you win, but you can have your photo taken next to a Lexus that has been dented so it resembles a dimpled golf ball. No word on whether this increases gas mileage. CHARLES McGRATH
641 2009-06-19 It appeared that the fans who held tickets for the first round were in the right place at the wrong time. Instead of seeing a stern test of golf, they were witnesses to the battering of the course by Mother Nature. It was the first time a round was not completed on the day it started at the Open since thunderstorms blew through Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, east of Bethpage, on the first day in 2004. It could get worse before it gets better.

With any luck, the U.S.G.A. will be able to determine a winner before the Fourth of July. Jeff Brehaut, who held a share of the lead, if you will, at one under par through 11 holes, said: “It’s not what any of us wants to deal with. But they’re still going to give out a trophy, I think.”

He laughed as he said that. Brehaut, a journeyman from Northern California who required 13 trips to PGA Tour qualifying school to earn his playing privileges, might have precisely what it takes to win this tournament: infinite patience.

Amid all the dark clouds, there was a bright side. At least Sergio García had an advantageous tee time this year. García was scheduled to go off in the afternoon (as was Phil Mickelson), meaning he stayed warm and dry. Woods, meanwhile, was one over after six holes, having battled his driver and the elements.

At the 2002 Open here, García earned the enmity of the fans when he carded a 74 in a steady downpour in the second round and then said that if Woods had been on the course later in the day in the worst of the weather instead of in the morning, when he carded a 68, the U.S.G.A. would have suspended play.

On that day, four-tenths of an inch of rain fell. The course was soaked Thursday by more than an inch. Justin Leonard, who was even par through seven, said the saving grace was that it was warmer than on that Friday in 2002. “It was obviously very difficult out there,” he said. “My goal was to forget about par and do the best I could.”

It was raining but not yet pouring when the marquee grouping of Woods, Padraig Harrington and Ángel Cabrera — the champions of the past four Grand Slam events — stepped to the first tee around 8 a.m. The applause that greeted Woods, who won the Open here in 2002 for one of his 14 major titles, was louder than a clap of thunder.

As the players stood on the tee box, under their umbrellas, waiting to hit, one fan yelled, “Go Padraig!” Another shouted, “Go Tiger!” There was a pause, and then from the opposite side of the bleachers someone squawked, “O.K., I’ll bite. Go Ángel!”

Cabrera, the reigning Masters champion and the 2007 Open winner, had said he would not be intimidated playing in front of the large and boisterous crowds that followed Woods.

He was at even par when play was stopped, despite a lapse in concentration on the first hole caused by the bustling of bystanders. Cabrera drove into the left rough but Woods hooked his ball worse, his tee shot coming to rest in front of a merchandise tent. It was the first fairway Woods had missed since the Saturday of the Memorial Tournament in Ohio in his final Open tune-up. Hitting first, Woods landed his second shot in a greenside bunker, after which photographers scurried to get back inside the ropes while fans filled the area that had been cleared for Woods. The maneuvering was worse than what takes place at the Holland Tunnel entrance during a Manhattan rush hour, and it was happening a few yards from where Cabrera stood over his ball.

Instead of backing off until everyone had settled, Cabrera hit a poor shot, his ball landing well in front of the green to set up his bogey. Woods saved par — the kind of Houdini escape that is the hallmark of Open champions — while Harrington three-putted for a bogey after gracing the green in two. When they arrived at the second green, they were met by six squeegee-bearing members of the maintenance crew who dried the green as the players were reading their putts and again between putts.

Keeping the greens fit for play became a futile task for the grounds crew, akin to raking leaves in a gale. Woods said he got in more holes than he expected to given the conditions. “It was a good decision to start today,” he said. “Playing was the right decision.”

Can this tournament be saved? The consensus was that the next 24 to 48 hours would be critical.
642 2009-06-19 The Dow and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained on Thursday, breaking a three-day losing streak, as data on the job market and regional manufacturing revived hope that the economy was stabilizing.

After gaining as much as 40 percent from a 12-year closing low in early March, the S.& P. 500 has eased as investors reassessed the potential strength of an economic recovery. The day’s data revived optimism, but analysts said real improvement was needed to sustain the rally.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 58.42 points, or 0.69 percent, to 8,555.60. The S.& P. 500 gained 7.66 points, or 0.84 percent, to 918.37. The Nasdaq composite index was off just 0.34 of a point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,807.72.

The Nasdaq ended little changed as some big-cap technology companies fell.

Financials supported the stock market after being among the week’s biggest drags. Discover Financial Services gained 4 percent, to $9.27, after it reported a smaller-than-expected operating loss as bad loans grew less than anticipated.

Lincoln National rose 6.9 percent, to $15.92, after an upgrade from Credit Suisse, and the KBW insurance index rose 1.8 percent. The S.& P. financial index gained 2.5 percent.

649 2009-06-20 Brehaut walked over from the practice range, where he had stood 10 yards from Tiger Woods. Woods, unlike Brehaut, was off to a shaky start, finishing the first round at four over par.

So, why not Jeff Brehaut?

We love to write about the impossible dream, accomplishing the impossible, attaining the unachievable.

That could be Brehaut, who, at age 46, has been through PGA Tour Qualifying School 13 times. His best season was 2005, when he had five top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.

Still, what’s to stop a 46-year-old journeyman from doing the unthinkable and being in contention for the final round? This is a compelling question, especially in individual competition, where so much depends on confidence, mental toughness and luck. In a four-day tournament, what is the difference between a player like Brehaut and Woods, golf’s icon?

Brehaut, ever the realist, recited a list: Woods is more of an athlete, is supremely dedicated and wants it more.

“He makes critical shots at critical times like nobody except for Nicklaus,” Brehaut said. “Guys like Tiger, they’re in this every week. He understands how his body adjusts, how his mind starts to think. The rest of us are kind of relearning what’s its like to have all those juices flowing.”

For the sake of argument, Brehaut allowed that he would continue to play as well as he did in the first round.

“Let’s just say that I was paired with Tiger the last day and we were tied or I was one behind or one ahead,” Brehaut said. “For me to overcome, mentally, that whole situation would be far more difficult than for him. I’d have so much going on in my mind to block out, and then I’d still have to beat him.”

Brehaut said his only real big pressure moment came when he got through qualifying school for the first time. It had taken him 13 tries and a lot of people, including his friends, were urging him to quit.

“When I finally did it, it was such a relief and satisfaction,” he said. “This is what I set out to do since I was 14 years old. I didn’t get there until I was 35.”

Gene and Marah Brehaut never gave up on their youngest son and here they were Friday, along with an older son, Steve, watching practice and reveling in a promising first round.

Gene had been an outstanding amateur golfer while growing up in San Francisco. In 1954, at age 21, he qualified for the national amateur championships and lost to the British amateur champion, who eventually lost to Arnold Palmer in the final.

Palmer went on to fame and glory. Gene Brehaut decided that he did not want to play professional golf, did not want to live in hotels, did not want to deal with the futility of chasing purses. “I wasn’t good enough,” he said.

He became a stockbroker and met Marah at the firm they worked for. More than four decades later, their youngest son is the family’s professional golfer, and here they were on a beautiful Friday afternoon at the Open, watching Jeff practice, two stations away from Tiger Woods.

Gene and Marah were optimistic — parents always are — that with solid golf and a few breaks their son might do the unthinkable and still be in the mix in the final round.

“Who knows?” Gene said. “I think his chances are good to be playing on the weekend, and then it’s just one of those things.”

Jeff was not all that certain. “I’m not going to say I don’t have a chance,” he said, “but I know I have a tougher road than some of these guys.”

There are favorites, underdogs and those beneath the underdog. Jeff Brehaut is part of that large last group. He has his doubts about succeeding at the Open, but he also has an enthusiastic cheering section that thinks he can.
650 2009-06-20 Re “A Bad Call on Gay Rights” (editorial, June 16), about the Obama administration’s brief in support of the Defense of Marriage Act:

The administration’s actions and rhetoric on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues fly against the promises made during Barack Obama’s historic campaign.

The Justice Department’s comparison of same-sex marriages to incestuous relationships is an unnecessary and deliberate sidestep to the fundamental question regarding the Defense of Marriage Act — that it has effectively legalized discrimination since its passage.

The president has talked about the need to lower the temperature on heated rhetoric and for Americans to find common ground on controversial issues. Sadly, his message has not been received by his Justice Department. Instead, it chooses hurtful language and political expediency.

We are a country that believes in the basic fundamentals of freedom, and we need to continue to extend this ideal to all communities. The time for equal rights is now, the time for the president to keep his heartfelt promise to us is today, and the time for legalized discrimination is over.
651 2009-06-20 The group comprised a Broadway flackdom’s Who’s (still) Who: Shirley Herz, 83, just awarded an honorary Tony Award; Bob Ullman, 86; David Rothenberg, 75; Merle Debuskey, 86; Howard Atlee (coy about his age); and Mickey Alpert, 71, who called himself “the baby of the group.” Leo Friedman, 90, dean of theater photographers, flew in from Las Vegas, and Harvey Sabinson, 84, laid up after hip surgery in Florida, talked later by phone. Missing was one of the group’s stalwarts: Lee Solters, who died last month at 89.

Mr. DeBuskey remembered looking for ways to promote Mike Todd’s racy 1950 production of “Peep Show,” in which an actress takes a bubble bath onstage. “I ran to the Stork Club and got two bottles of their Sortilege perfume, and we put it in the bubble bath,” he recalled. “The audience could never get the smell off their clothes.”

Mr. Ullman recalled the playwright George S. Kaufman’s verdict on the 1944 flop “Allah Be Praised!,” produced by the department store scion Alfred S. Bloomingdale. “I’d close the show,” Mr. Kaufman advised, “and keep the store open nights.”

That brought up debacles, and everyone had a story. Mr. Alpert remembered a show called “Bella” that ran — ever so briefly — Off Broadway in 1961. The critic Walter Kerr always carried a playbill from “Bella” with him, or so the story went, because someday he might see a show he would consider the worst show ever and he would tap the playbill and think, “No, ‘Bella’ is the worst show.”

Tallulah Bankhead was supposed to pick up a ringing phone onstage in the 1962 show “Here Today” and set the action in motion with her conversation. “She forgot her lines,” Mr. Ullman remembered, and she handed the phone to a surprised co-star, saying, “It’s for you.”

Tallulah — that set off a flurry of reminiscences. It was her press agent, Dick Maney, Mr. Jacobson remembered, who threw up his hands, saying, “A day away from Tallulah is like a month in the country.” (Others have also been credited with the line.)

That reminded him, Mr. Jacobson said: “Maney knew Charlie before he went to Hollywood. He was just a comedian in Seattle.”

Charlie? There were some blank stares around the table.

“Charlie Chaplin,” Mr. Jacobson said. “He was always trying to get Maney to go out to Hollywood.”

Ms. Herz, who worked with Mr. Ullman in a partnership they called His and Herz, recalled apprenticing with another industry legend, Samuel J. Friedman, for whom the Manhattan Theater Club’s Biltmore Theater was renamed last year.

He was dismayed to have a woman in the office, complaining, as she recalled, that he could no longer curse his usual blue streak.

Many of the stories involved the irascible Mr. Merrick, with Mr. Sabinson recalling the producer’s response when asked for a comment on the death of an overweight critic he had considered a tormentor. “Tell them this,” Mr. Merrick instructed his press agent: “The fat’s in the fire.”

But one question stymied the table: With all the changes in the business over the ages, did young people still dream of becoming press agents?

“This,” said Mr. Rothenberg, “is not the group to ask.”
652 2009-06-20 The global financial crisis has pushed the ranks of the hungry to a record 1 billion people, a milestone that poses a threat to peace and security, United Nations food officials said Friday in Rome. Because of war, drought, political instability, high food prices and poverty, hunger now affects one in six people, according to an estimate by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. There are100 million more hungry people now than last year, the agency said. It defines hunger as the consumption of fewer than 1,800 calories a day.
653 2009-06-20 A group of General Motors bondholders and some of the automaker’s labor unions filed objections on Friday to G.M.’s plan to sell its assets to a new company that could emerge from bankruptcy protection.

Their opposition, with objections filed by consumer groups, a handful of states and cities, and individual retirees, shareholders and bondholders, threatens to put the brakes on what the company and the government had hoped would be a rapid trip through the Chapter 11 process.

The bondholders’ group, Unofficial Committee of Family and Dissident G.M. Bondholders, said it was being treated unfairly compared with the automaker’s other stakeholders and deserved more than the 10 percent stake in the new company that it would receive if the sale went through.

In its motion, the bondholders group accused G.M. and the federal government of unjustly hurrying the case through bankruptcy at the expense of the bondholders and dividing the new company’s assets “among a few select favored classes.”

“G.M.’s bondholders appear to be the most disfavored and discriminated class in the scheme,” the group wrote, pointing to the 17.5 percent stake that the United Automobile Workers union is slated to get under the sale.

The group says it represents about 1,500 bondholders with holdings worth more than $400 million. It is also asking the court to permit it to create a formal committee that could negotiate with G.M. separately from the larger bank and investment firm bondholders. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Tuesday.

A G.M. spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, declined to comment on the group’s objection, saying that the company did not discuss specific claims or possible outcomes that would be determined by the bankruptcy court.
654 2009-06-20 Under the new system it will not be unusual for a local Macy’s to stock the merchandise customers request, be it wide-width shoes or suits, and for those offerings to be different from the ones in a Macy’s store 100 miles away.

“I think what Macy’s is embarking on is perhaps the largest transformation in our company in a couple of decades,” said , president and chief executive.

The Macy’s change is just one example of a wide range of initiatives retailers are pursuing as they struggle to cope with an economy where sales are lower than they were just a few years ago.

At high-end stores, the era of ever-escalating prices on luxury goods appears to be over. In the future, consumers will still be able to buy chic brand names, but at a wider range of prices.

“Our customer loves our brands,” said Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks. “They don’t want to trade down to lower brands. But they want more of a range in price within the brands that they love.”

And that is what retailers intend to give them. Burton M. Tansky, president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group, told investors on a conference call last week that “we’re working with the designers to try and ease a portion of their collections into a new price range.”

Prices will also be lower at some “affordable luxury” chains, like Coach, which is increasing the proportion of handbags it sells for less than $300. About 50 percent of the company’s handbags will cost $200 to $300, in contrast to about 30 percent of handbags last year.

Another change is that consumers will have fewer brands from which to choose. Wal-Mart, Target, , and PetSmart are just a few of the chains winnowing their brands. As Home Depot’s executive vice president for merchandising, Craig Menear, put it: consumers are “time-starved” and “looking for simplification in the entire shopping experience.”

That may delight minimalists, because it will be easier to find items on the shelves. But it also limits choice.

Another potential drawback for consumers is that stores may run out of stock more quickly than in the past because, as Mr. Lundgren of Macy’s explained, “retailers learned that you can’t get out of the merchandise that you ordered months before.”

“Instead,” he said, “you’re more likely to see retailers ordering fewer of each individual size and taking that risk that they’ll sell out and not capture every sale, rather than the risk of having too much inventory left over to mark down.”

Another trend is on the horizon: seasonal transitions for apparel will probably have shorter lead times. With strapped consumers buying only what they need when they need it, it has occurred to retailers that selling swimsuits to New Yorkers in early March is not necessarily a winning strategy. And so chains are beginning to work with suppliers to shorten the time between ordering and delivering merchandise.

Consumers will also see even more of the exclusive collaborations between retailers and prominent designers that are so prevalent today. That will help distinguish stores as well as avoid price wars because the same items will not be sold at multiple chains.

Yet another change will be the obliteration of any remaining divide between online and in-store shopping.

In Sears stores, “appliance research centers” with computers are enabling customers to compare local competitors’ prices. (If Sears does not offer the best price, it will match the lowest offer and hand over 10 percent of the difference.) Four J. C. Penney stores in are testing “FindMore” machines the size of arcade games, letting customers see every item J. C. Penney sells and find out if the item they want is in the store or online.

Shopping by cellphone will also become widespread.

“Everything we are developing is with a mind-set that it’s going to be running on a handset,” said J. C. Penney’s chief information officer, Thomas M. Nealon.

Despite all the new technology, consumers will be getting more attention from sales staff. During the last few years, retailers did not have to work hard to separate consumers from their dollars.

But those days are over. More middle-market chains are striving for -quality service to win customers. Even Home Depot has adopted its “most extensive customer service training ever,” its chairman and chief executive, , told investors and retailing analysts last week.

Of course, luxury chains have always featured a high level of attentiveness. But the chains say that in this economy, customers have heightened expectations. Saks, for one, has invested tens of millions of dollars in the last year on software that provides its sales staff easy access to information about client purchases and preferences, so that a returning customer might be greeted by a sales representative who recalls the shopper’s suit size and penchant for Christian Louboutin heels.

Economists and analysts forecast that it will take up to 10 years to return to 2007 levels of consumer spending — which makes now a good time for retailers to re-imagine the future. Paul A. Laudicina, chairman and managing officer of A. T. Kearney, the management consulting firm, noted that major consumer innovations like Neoprene and Teflon came out of the Depression.

Mr. Lundgren pointed out that if consumers were still throwing money around, stores might not want to alter strategies that were still working.

But with today’s recession, he said, “now is the time to aggressively rock the boat.”
655 2009-06-20 A Minneapolis jury ruled on Thursday that a 32-year-old woman must pay $1.92 million to six record companies for illegally downloading songs released by those labels from the Internet, Agence France-Presse reported. The woman, Jammie Thomas-Rasset, a single mother of four from Brainerd, Minn., was found liable for violating the copyrights of major labels including Sony BMG, Warner Brothers and Universal by downloading 24 songs from Kazaa, a peer-to-peer file-sharing service. Ms. Thomas-Rasset had testified that her former husband or her children may have downloaded the songs. But a lawyer for the Recording Industry Association of America, which filed the suit, said that she “infringed my clients’ copyrights and that she then tried to cover it up,” according to Agence France-Presse. An earlier judgment of $220,000 against Ms. Thomas-Rasset was thrown out by a judge who deemed it excessive.
656 2009-06-20 People who watch top-level bridge on Bridge Base Online (bridgebase.com) see everything: brilliancies, boring boards and bad blunders. Sometimes, though, the match situation makes it even more exciting.

At the open trial in White Plains a week ago, Aubrey Strul, Michael Becker, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby played against Roy Welland, Chris Willenken, Billy Cohen, Ron Smith, Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein. With 16 boards to go, Welland led by 45 international match points.

It looked to be all over. But Strul had several big gains and had apparently moved ahead by 3 imps with three boards to play. The next two were flat. The final deal is in the diagram. The spectators were on the edges of their computer keyboards.

At the other table, Berkowitz (South) opened one spade, which was limited to 15 points. (He would have bid one club, strong and artificial, with 16 points or more.) Smith (West) overcalled two hearts, Cohen (North) jumped to four spades, and everyone passed.

West led the heart ace. After that, it did not matter what he did; declarer was going to lose only three tricks to the missing aces. Plus 420 seemed to lock up the match for Strul. Five diamonds by East would go down only one. And a club lead could defeat four spades. (East could win the trick and shift to a diamond, or cover dummy’s card, then, when in with his club winner, lead a diamond.)

The other room had been playing more slowly. We all used our mice to move to that table, expecting to see the conclusion of a remarkable recovery.

662 2009-06-21 It may be necessary as The Times tries to align revenue and costs. But I think it is risky and makes it imperative to find a way to get money from online readers, who now get everything that is in the newspaper — and more — free.

“Surely they’ve heard of that phrase, ‘death by a thousand cuts,’ ” said John Morton, a newspaper analyst. “The more reason you give people to go away from your newspaper for information, the more damage you do to your franchise.”

Morton said he recognizes the pressures that The Times and all newspapers are under, with advertising revenue essentially falling off the table. In the first quarter of this year, it was down 27 percent for Media Group, which includes The Times and the International Herald Tribune.

The Times deserves great for cutting far less than other newspapers. While others have closed and overseas news bureaus, made wholesale reductions in newsgathering staffs, and slashed the space devoted to news, The Times has held remarkably steady.

The newsroom budget of more than $200 million is being trimmed by millions this year — editors refuse to say exactly how much — and staffers have taken a 5 percent pay cut. But editors say the newshole for the main daily sections has not changed since it was reduced by 5 percent in 2007. The newsroom head count, roughly 1,250, is close to its peak, although many are doing jobs unheard of a few years ago, like producers of video and audio for the Web site. While there are fewer reporters covering local news, there are more covering Washington and more overseas than a decade ago. Though the number of still photographers is down by a couple, there are a dozen new videographers.

John Geddes, the managing editor in charge of newsroom operations, said he knows that readers are upset when they lose content about which they care passionately, but he said the goal in these tough times is to preserve “what separates us from everyone else: that’s the reporting and the writing and the scope.”

Scott Heekin-Canedy, the president and general manager of the newspaper, said that The Times has always added and subtracted content and that most readers believe that the overall value of the paper is undiminished by recent changes. He said that roughly 825,000 of The Times’s one million subscribers have been taking the paper for two years or more, a sign of remarkable loyalty. Some newspapers turn over — or churn — a majority of their subscribers every year.

Heekin-Canedy said The Times looks at other products when it considers a price increase — $1.50 to $2 for a bottle of Coke, $2 for a cup of or $2 for a . Michael Norris of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., wrote to Yasmin Namini, the executive in charge of circulation, “I am embarrassed that we pay so little for what continues to be the finest daily newspaper in the world.” Norris added, “Count us in for whatever rate you decide to be necessary to ensure the continued survival of The Times.”

Times executives are studying possible ways to charge readers for online content, an increasing focus in the industry as the world moves to the Web. Heekin-Canedy said options include a so-called metered model, charging customers for how much they read, and a membership model that would leave much content free but give members benefits, like access to special events. He expects decisions by mid to late summer.

I am already hearing from readers who want to pony up for what they read online. “I would pay a lot to keep a free press and energetic reporters on the job,” said Cherie Rouse of Loma Linda, Calif. Jeffrey Alexander of Kenosha, Wis., asked, “Could there at least be a tip jar?”

Some readers, like Brian Jones of , R.I., say they cannot do without The Times but wish it would be more candid in explaining what is going on. He had to do the arithmetic to figure out from the notice of the price increase that his subscription was going up by a double-digit percentage. “Deal honestly with me,” he said.

Some announcements of changes have been models of clarity and candor. In a letter last Sunday explaining why the magazine was 9 percent smaller, its editor, Gerald Marzorati, made clear that he did not like making the change but told how he and his staff turned a crisis into a redesign that better organized the magazine and minimized content loss.

Other announcements are perfunctory, failing to explain the reasons behind the moves. Readers deserve those details. They have shown that they understand the problems The Times faces.

“I’ve been in this business a long time,” Namini said, “and I always get letters from people unhappy about price increases.” But this time is different, she said. “I’ve never seen so many letters from people who say, ‘I understand it,’ ” she said. Those readers feel “they have a relationship with The Times. They’re not just reading a newspaper.”

The Times is indeed the strongest news brand in the . Preserving it through what amounts to an advertising depression and the Internet revolution may be the greatest challenge the newspaper has ever faced.
663 2009-06-21 The chief executive of Apple, Steven P. Jobs, who has been on a medical leave since January for treatment of what he called a hormone imbalance, underwent a liver transplant two months ago at a hospital in Tennessee, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.

The newspaper said doctors had advised Mr. Jobs to return to work as planned at the end of this month, but on a part-time basis. Mr. Jobs, through his wife, Laurene Powell, declined to comment on Saturday when reached at the couple’s home in Palo Alto, Calif.

In 2004, Mr. Jobs had surgery to remove a growth called an islet cell tumor from his pancreas. That procedure, according to people briefed on his illness, created chronic digestive problems and contributed to severe weight loss.

Dr. Kara Fine, an endocrinologist in New York who has not treated Mr. Jobs, said the liver transplant might be related to the digestive problems, or to some unknown condition, and not to a spreading of his cancer.

“If the cancer had spread to his liver,” Dr. Fine said, “it is probably in the lymph nodes, and then a transplant is not an accepted treatment and would not cure it.”

An Apple spokeswoman, Katie Cotton, confirmed Saturday that Mr. Jobs was due back at work at the end of the month.

Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company, said a successful transplant could be “good news for Apple.”
664 2009-06-21 The episode highlights some of the complications that can ensue as states increasingly turn to private groups to keep their ever-growing networks of roads clean.

In some Adopt-a-Highway programs, sponsors clean up the roads themselves, while in others they hire contractors. Either way, the programs free up millions of dollars in pinched state transportation budgets for more vital maintenance projects.

The vast majority of highways are adopted by civic groups and businesses. But states have little leeway when it comes to signing off on the adoption papers for their roads, and several have found themselves compelled to put up signs recognizing groups with long histories of racism or anti-Semitism or associations or businesses that have engendered controversy.

officials were surprised to learn from reporters this year that the National Alliance, a white separatist group, had adopted a highway. The group’s sign honored its late founder, William Pierce, whose novel “The Turner Diaries” inspired to bomb the federal building in 1995.

Chuck Wolfe, a spokesman for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, said officials initially hoped they could terminate the contract, but determined that doing so would open them to costly litigation that might fail.

Some states are grappling with how to administer the programs, which have become widespread in the past two decades.

’s Adopt-a-Highway program stopped accepting new applicants about a year ago to re-evaluate its program. The state has been tangled in litigation over the program since it tried to remove an Adopt-a-Highway sign it had awarded to the San Diego Minutemen, a self-appointed border patrol group, on a stretch of road near an official checkpoint in .

Latino lawmakers and immigrants’ rights groups had objected to the sign and accused the Minutemen of promoting discrimination. A federal judge later ordered the sign back up.

Earlier this year, several cities allowed the fast-food chain KFC to fill potholes and stencil “Re-Freshed by KFC” in temporary lettering on them. In response, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered to pave potholes if they could write “KFC Tortures Animals” on them. The group was refused.

And after officials worried aloud about “suggestive” billboard advertisements on one of their highways, a store that sells pornography adopted parts of the highway.

In Missouri, members of the National Socialist Movement spent last Saturday cleaning up their bit of road and last Sunday protesting homosexuality. The group’s Web site calls for a nation where “only those of pure White blood” who are not Jewish or gay can be citizens, and demanding that “all non-Whites currently residing in America be required to leave the nation forthwith and return to their land of origin: peacefully or by force.”

Ms. Keene said members of the group, who sometimes wear swastikas, wanted to do community service. “We decided about a year ago we wanted to get more involved,” she said.

But their Adopt-a-Highway sign, which says “Litter Cleanup 0.5 Miles National Socialist Movement Springfield Unit,” upset people in the area, particularly Jews. The Jewish Community Relations Bureau/American Jewish Committee in hit on the idea of renaming the road.

“It was not an original thought,” confessed Michael Abrams, the group’s chairman, who recalled how a stretch of road near downtown that had been adopted by the Ku Klux Klan was renamed in 2000 for . The group chose Rabbi Heschel as an appropriate person to honor, noting that he marched in with the Rev. Dr.

State Representative Sara Lampe, a Springfield Democrat who introduced the renaming bill, said a memorial sign approved by the legislature sent a stronger signal than an Adopt-a-Highway sign.

“Memorial highways are about people we honor and we value,” she said. “Adopt-a-Highway signs are self-requested. Any business can request a sign.”
665 2009-06-21 You can almost read the executives’ minds: We laid off people, reduced salaries and trimmed the health care plan and the expense accounts. We even canceled the holiday party. But we still need to cut costs. What now?

According to a survey of 283 companies by Grant Thornton, almost 87 percent said their 401(k) plans provided for matching company contributions before 2009. But that figure is falling. Nearly 30 percent of the companies have already changed the matching feature, or plan to do so.

Of those, two-thirds said the change involved ending the match. Health care and nonprofit companies said they were less likely to make such changes in their 401(k) plans, while technology and retail/trade companies said they were more likely to do so, Grant Thornton reported.

Workers, of course, don’t want this perk to go away, especially in a recession, as it provides a much-needed cushion for retirement.
666 2009-06-21 The subprime crisis was essentially the old junk-bond scam on supersteroids, with nuclear weapons thrown in.

Collateralized mortgage obligation bonds were sold as having far lower risk of default than was really true for the subprime mortgages within them. This was bad enough. But those bonds were also booby-trapped by being attached to credit-default swaps, like a Viet Cong trap in Quang Tri province in 1971.

Once the C.M.O. bomb was detonated, its connection to the staggeringly potent credit-default swaps blew holes in immense entities like A.I.G. and took down Lehman Brothers.

In essence, because of the hugely incorrect estimates of how likely defaults were in a very large asset class owned by the finance sector, the reserves that the sector took for defaults were too small. That meant the earnings of this sector were staggeringly unrealistic and inflated. When these losses were taken, a panic set in and we are still in it: we have badly shaken financial entities and in many cases an extreme hesitation to lend has developed.

Now, what does this have to do with Father’s Day?

Only that this kind of thing happens again and again where Wall Street is concerned, as my father, Herbert Stein, the sensible and witty economist, always reminded me. If Wall Streeters can fudge numbers and get very rich from that fudging, some may do it — and ordinary Americans will see their hard-earned money disappear.

And as my father used to say, Wall Street makes itself seem indispensable, so it is never really punished.

Since late 2007, a stupendous amount of Americans’ savings has disappeared as prices of stocks and real estate have collapsed. This means that money you and I worked for, and money our fathers worked for and left to us, has vanished, along with some of our hope for a peaceful and serene old age. Again, the responsible parties are sitting pretty.

What do we do about it?

As individual investors, we undoubtedly should hold more cash and short-term Treasuries. We should be more leery of stocks and real estate. It’s true that we might miss out on big upward moves in stocks and real estate — and those moves can be humbling. Nevertheless, we have to be more cautious.

It’s Father’s Day, and some of us have to remember that we are the daddies now. That means that if we aren’t cautious, there will be no one there to bail us out except for Daddy Obama, and then only along the margins.

It’s Father’s Day, and, unfortunately, it’s time to remember that there’s a sucker born every minute, and that plenty of sharp operators are ready — sometimes wearing yellow suspenders with ducks on them and smiling.

It’s Father’s Day, and I can well imagine my father sympathizing with my losses and saying my grandmother’s favorite line: “Don’t worry about it — you’ll do it again.” And so we do, time after time.

Man is divided into predator and prey, and there is some of both in each of us. When our fathers are not there to protect us, we can get into trouble.
667 2009-06-21 HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) — Bermuda’s premier survived a no-confidence vote on Saturday aimed at punishing him for allowing four former Guantánamo prisoners to settle in the British island territory.

Parliament rejected the resolution in a 22-11 vote after 14 hours of debate, which went through the night.

Opposition lawmakers accused the premier, Ewart F. Brown, of “autocratic” behavior for agreeing in secret with United States authorities to accept the former prisoners, ethnic Uighurs originally from western China, without consulting political leaders in Bermuda or the British government.

Kim Swan, leader of the opposition United Bermuda Party, told fellow lawmakers that the resolution was aimed not at the government but at Mr. Brown, for causing an “international debacle.”

Mr. Brown said that he had accepted the Uighurs on humanitarian grounds, and that he believed that the move improved relations with the United States by helping to resolve a diplomatic headache.

American authorities had determined that the Uighurs were not terrorists and ordered their release, but they could not be sent back to China, where they might have faced persecution for their separatist beliefs. Other countries refused to accept them.
668 2009-06-21 Over that year, the monks slipped out of their monastery, trekked into the mountains, slept in nomads’ tents, sneaked into Lhasa aboard a high-altitude train and crossed a raging river to Nepal. It was only here in a refugee center that they could tell their tale to a reporter, opening a rare window into the deep-rooted resentment that bloomed last year into the largest Tibetan uprising in decades.

Chinese officials insist that the protests were orchestrated by the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans. The monks from Labrang say harsh Chinese policies sparked the tinder, especially limitations on Buddhist practice.

“I and my friends decided on our own to protest,” Lobsang said. “The protests were caused by human rights issues and Chinese policies toward Tibet. We couldn’t tolerate it anymore.”

He added, “I joined the protests with the idea of saving Buddhism, which is endangered by Chinese policy. I want His Holiness the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet, but the Chinese don’t even allow us to display his picture.”

Labrang Monastery is one of the most important centers of religious study in the Tibetan world, a white-walled labyrinth of monks’ cells and temples dating from the 18th century. It housed about 500 monks before last year’s protests. Chinese policies in this frontier land called Amdo, at the nexus of the Tibetan, Hui Muslim and Han Chinese worlds, have traditionally been less strict than in central Tibet.

But even there, the Communist Party employs heavy-handed methods to control religious practice, said the three monks and two others who fled with them to Dharamsala.

The government limits the number of monks allowed to live in the monastery, they said. Officials cracked down on festivities honoring the Dalai Lama. When the Chinese-appointed Panchen Lama visited Labrang several years ago, monks were forced to stay indoors to prevent disturbances.

Last year, when monks in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, began leading peaceful protests on March 10, word spread quickly to Labrang.

Thousands of monks and lay people in Xiahe marched to government offices demanding the return of the Dalai Lama. Some protesters broke into buildings and threw stones at riot police officers.

From then on, the government tightened the screws on the monastery, the monks said. A curfew was imposed. Security officers arrested several monks each night. The monastery began to empty out.

“Some monks ran off to their homes in the countryside,” said Jamyang Jinpa, 24.

The authorities began holding daily hourlong patriotic education classes, in which the monks were forced to read tracts denouncing the Dalai Lama and pledge loyalty to the Communist Party.

“As a Buddhist monk who believes in the Dalai Lama as our foundation, it was unbearable to read this,” Lobsang said.

On the night of April 8, some monks heard on the radio that foreign journalists were to arrive in Labrang the next day on a government tour.

“We immediately stopped what we were doing that night and started discussing the protest,” Jamyang said.

A half-dozen monks brought out a Tibetan flag and scrawled slogans on three white banners. “We have no freedom of speech,” read one. They wrote their wills on the back of the flag because they thought there was a good chance they would be killed by Chinese security forces, Jamyang said.

When they went to the main temple the next morning, they were struck by a strange sight: Hundreds of people were milling about the square outside. Most were plainclothes Chinese security officers.

“We knew then that the journalists were coming,” Jamyang said. “We pretended to visit the temple.”

When the journalists and their government escorts pulled up in minivans, the monks dashed across the square, unfurling their flag and banners. A few words were exchanged in Chinese. Some monks draped white ceremonial scarves around the necks of several journalists.

“The Chinese people in plainclothes took photos of us, but they dared not stop us in front of the journalists,” Jamyang said.

That night, security officers searched the cells of the monks involved in the protest, but the monks had hidden elsewhere. The next night, Jamyang slipped into the mountains and kept walking until dawn.

“After the protest, I felt I would be arrested at any time,” he said.

Jamyang spent the first two months mostly sleeping outdoors, he said, sometimes in ditches that he had dug himself. He tossed away his red robes and began growing out his hair. In the summer, he wandered to the high pastures and slept in the tents of nomads.

“In my dreams, sometimes I would see myself getting shot and dying,” he said.

Two other monks from the protest, Lobsang and Jigme Gyatso, also fled the monastery in the days after Jamyang left. The three stayed apart. After nearly a year in hiding, the monks learned of a guide in Lhasa who could smuggle them into Nepal.

Using fake identification cards, they boarded the new high-altitude train to Lhasa. A driver then sneaked them past checkpoints to the Nepal border, where they crossed a river on logs.

Of the 15 monks who took part in that protest in front of the journalists, only these three have escaped to India. That they made it here is considered extraordinary given how tightly Chinese authorities clamped down on Tibet. The refugee center here usually gets 2,500 to 3,000 Tibetans per year, but that dropped to 550 last year. By the end of May, only 176 refugees had arrived, said Ngawang Norbu, the center’s director.

The monks say they have no regrets about holding the protest — to them, there was no other way to show the world their true feelings about Chinese rule.

“I miss my friends and family in Tibet, but I try to bury my feelings,” Jamyang said. “At the moment, I can’t return to Tibet, and I don’t know about the future.”
669 2009-06-21 One explanation is that gay and lesbian activists learned early on that they could get along just fine without one. Even in the movement’s earliest days following the violent uprising at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village 40 years ago this week, no singular leader emerged. Some historians believe this is in part because it was — and still is — difficult for the average American to empathize with the struggles of gay people.

“The gay movement has always had a problem of achieving a dignity or a moral imperative that the black civil rights movement had, or the women’s rights movement claimed,” said Dudley Clendinen, who co-wrote the book “Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America” and now teaches writing at Johns Hopkins University. “Because this movement is fundamentally about the right to be sexual, it’s hard for the larger public to see that as a moral issue,” he said.

By contrast, the moral authority that leaders like Dr. King, Ms. Friedan and Ms. Steinem could claim — and the fact that Americans did not look at them and imagine their sex lives — made it easier to build respectability with the public.

Another reason for the absence of a nationally prominent gay leader is the highly local nature of the movement. Unlike the civil rights and the feminist movements, the gay movement lacked a galvanizing national issue.

In the 1950s and 1960s, black activists pushed for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act and asserted their rights in the courts in cases like Brown v. Board of Education. Feminists campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.

“Betty and her group wanted to do it from a more top-down approach,” said Daniel Horowitz, a professor of American studies at Smith College who wrote a biography of Ms. Friedan. “You go to Washington and you lobby members of Congress. In fact, she talked explicitly about the N.A.A.C.P. as her model, and the N.A.A.C.P. had achieved its goals primarily through Supreme Court cases.”

Many gay activists pursued a different approach, focusing on issues pertinent to their local communities. Though he has achieved celebrity status of late, Harvey Milk was a mere San Francisco city supervisor, without much in the way of a national profile, when he was assassinated in 1978.

City councils and state legislatures are where domestic partnership laws and legislation extending anti-discrimination protections to gays and lesbians originated. In 1982, Wisconsin became the first state to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. And of the six states that now allow same-sex marriage, three — Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont — legalized the practice through a vote by the state legislature, without prodding by a court.

“The issues of gay rights are mainly state issues, so the focus for activism is going to be on the local level,” said David Eisenbach, a lecturer in history at Columbia University and the author of “Gay Power: An American Revolution.”

The shifting legal and political environment that has confronted the movement over the years has also made it difficult for a singular leader to emerge.

After the Stonewall uprising 40 years ago, the goal was to persuade society to stop treating gays and lesbians like social deviants.

That movement for equality was later overshadowed by efforts to combat AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s. And AIDS itself is a reason leaders were hard to come by. “AIDS wiped out a whole generation,” Mr. Eisenbach said. “What you have is a vacuum. And that still has not been filled.”

As the AIDS crisis was contained, gay activists shifted their focus in the late 1990s and early 2000s to laws about discrimination, hate crimes and domestic partnerships. Successes on those issues were due in large part to gay rights groups that rose up at the local level and learned to work with local lawmakers.

Until 2003, few even contemplated that gay couples would be able to marry. Then Massachusetts’ highest court ruled that gay couples had that right under the state’s Constitution, ushering in a whole new phase of the movement. Activists on the state and local levels were already well in place and found themselves positioned to wage the campaigns for same-sex marriage — as the recent successes in the Northeast have shown.

“They see dispersal as a great thing, that it’s better not to have a concentration or too much attention overinvested in one individual,” said David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who has written about the civil rights and women’s rights movements.“The speed and breadth of change has been just breathtaking,” he added. “But it’s happened without a Martin Luther King.”
670 2009-06-21 But apparently, after some of the People had fired up the heaters in their cars to take the chill out of their knees, their inner New Yorker kicked in, and they began complaining to radio talk shows or assorted Internet outlets, or they just plain bayed at the moon.

Or maybe the protesters never had a ticket to the Open but were acting out of deferred anger over the unbelievable price of tickets our two friendly New York ball clubs have inflicted on the People this season — prices from which they are now backtracking.

The Mets have been discounting tickets for this weekend’s series against Tampa Bay, with seats listed at $90 going for $45. And the Yankees rewarded loyal fans who sat out a five-hour rain delay Thursday by allowing them into the expensive seats, with the bonus of using their rain check to purchase selected half-price tickets.

And let us not forget the grotesque seat licenses our two friendly football teams are extorting from loyal fans for the new stadium in New Jersey. So the People are not amused. And golf took the hit.

Sensing the possibility of the People bearing wooden pitchforks and converging on Bethpage Black, the U.S.G.A. executive director, David Fay, said approximately 34,000 tickets from Thursday would be honored on Monday, if the tournament were to be extended an extra day. He noted that somebody had complained to him while he was filling up his car at a gas station, the revolution becoming personal.

Until then, I had been under the impression that people who attend events like the Open accept the caveat emptor. The United States Open of tennis has a 90-minute policy, and the British Open of golf accepts two hours of play as fulfilling its responsibility. And at Wimbledon, if it rains all day, sorry, sir, but you may purchase another punnet of strawberries.

Real golf fans seem to get the rules. No mulligans. Stephen Folan, who runs a family insurance agency in Port Washington, N.Y., said of his Open ticket for Thursday: “Once they started, I never expected to be able to use it again. It’s not like football or baseball, where they can reschedule it. You can’t have 55,000 extra people come back the next day. That’s golf.” Folan did hold on to his ticket but will not be able to use it himself. He has a golf outing with colleagues on Monday.

How bad can the economy be if people pay $75 or $100 or more to get very wet and catch a distant glimpse of Tiger Woods? Then again, I have a distant relationship with the sport. I guffaw at the memory of Furio, the pony-tailed gangster on “The Sopranos,” as he menaced a doctor for a favorable medical opinion. Furio edged him into the water while delivering his verdict on golf: stupid blankety game.

Still, golf is a great sport — to play or watch. Woods looked miserable Saturday as he tried to marshal himself back into contention. Some golfers do a little dance for joy or shake their head in disgust. I liked the way Nathan Tyler, 26, disdainfully slung his club after holing a bogey from a sand trap. Woods wastes no energy displaying emotions. He always seems to be thinking about the next shot. And he kept himself alive for the third round, on a long day of golf.

The main thing was that the U.S.G.A. did not confront the mob, did not detect the clatter of wooden pitchforks. The revolution was averted, for the moment.
671 2009-06-21 WASHINGTON — President Obama, striking a forceful tone, said Saturday that he would fight for his package on overhauling the financial regulatory system as he tried to drum up support for his proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency.

In his weekly radio and Internet address, Mr. Obama promised to battle what he called special interests. “The American people sent me to Washington to stand up for their interests,” he said. “And while I’m not spoiling for a fight, I’m ready for one.”

The president characterized the need for regulatory changes as “necessary to end” the economic crisis.

“As we continue to recover from an historic economic crisis,” he said, “it is clear to everyone that one of its major causes was a breakdown in oversight that led to widespread abuses in the financial system.

“An epidemic of irresponsibility took hold from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street. And the consequences have been disastrous. Millions of Americans have seen their life savings erode. Families have been devastated by job losses. Business large and small have closed their doors.”

She is the daughter of Joanne Y. Taira of Honolulu and David P. Gisselquist of Hershey, Pa. She is the stepdaughter of Carol Gisselquist and of Hugh Taira. The bride’s father is an independent development economist, focusing on agriculture. Her mother is the special assistant to the vice president for planning and policy at the University of Hawaii system. She works in Manoa, Hawaii.

Dr. McDoom, 36, is completing a post-doctoral fellowship at Oxford on African politics and violent conflict. In October, he is to become a lecturer in comparative politics at the London School of Economics, from which he received a Ph.D. in development studies. He is also a director of the Child is Innocent, a nonprofit organization in Boston and Kampala, Uganda, that educates children who have been affected by the conflict in northern Uganda. He graduated with a law degree from King’s College London, received a law degree from the University of Paris 1, Panthéon-Sorbonne, and a master’s in international affairs from George Washington University.

He is the son of Leila R. McDoom of London and the late Shahabudin Mohamed McDoom. The bridegroom’s mother is a legal secretary at Schubert Murphy Solicitors in London. His father was a prosecutor for the Greater London Council, a local government organization. After his retirement, he became the Muslim representative on Guyana’s Race Relations Commission and served on the executive committee of the Central Islamic Organization of Guyana.
673 2009-06-21 Emily Dorine Griset and Andrew Michael Chin were married Saturday at the Cochran Chapel at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. The Rev. Steven M. Notis, a United Methodist minister, performed the ceremony.

The bride, 26, is keeping her name. Until April, she was an associate in the trusts and estates department of the New York law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. She graduated summa cum laude from Boston University and received her law degree from New York University.

She is a daughter of Linda D. Griset of Andover and William J. Griset Jr. of Reading, Mass. Her father is a lawyer in private practice, with offices in Lynnfield, Mass., and Sanford, Me.; he specializes in civil litigation. Her mother is a librarian at the Pike School in Andover.

674 2009-06-21 Ms. Edel and Mr. McClelland met during high school in New York in the winter of 1999 — she as a Trinity sophomore, he as a junior at Collegiate — when his school recruited girls from other private schools to put on the play “The Bacchae,” by Euripides. They were both in the chorus.

“He was very intelligent and very sweet, and very goofy,” she recalled. They became friends and often spoke late at night on the phone.

Mr. McClelland admitted to having developed a crush on her, but romantically he was very timid until a Y2K New Year’s Eve party when he made a move, which abruptly ended their friendship.

“We had a make-out session,” Mr. McClelland said. “And literally I freaked out and stopped talking to her for five years.”

Ms. Edel would roll her eyes, she recalled, whenever her mother would say, “You never know when you grow up, you could reconnect with people.”

In November 2005, with the trauma of that New Year’s Eve party long faded, Mr. McClelland proved her mother right.

“We reconnected when I was dating a former sorority sister of hers,” said Mr. McClelland, who got Ms. Edel’s e-mail address and, within a couple of days, sent an e-mail message.

He didn’t realize, though, that Ms. Edel was on a teaching fellowship in Scotland.

“Come over anytime,” Ms. Edel said. “I live in Edinburgh.”

Instead, they made plans to see each other when Ms. Edel returned to New York for the holidays. Their date, on Dec. 20, happened to coincide with a transit strike. But he was so intent on seeing her that he walked 50 blocks from Columbia, where he was taking pre-med classes. “I definitely didn’t want to take a rain check,” he said.

Although their friendship was back on track, there was no kiss before they went their separate ways again.

In August 2006, after Ms. Edel returned from Scotland and Mr. McClelland returned from a summer volunteer program in India, they had a movie date near her parents’ Westhampton summer house. It was followed by a kiss.

It also served to close the loop for her mother, who had been patiently waiting for that moment.

From the first, her mother said, “I told my husband he was a keeper.”
675 2009-06-21 Clara Elena Brillembourg, the daughter of Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg and Arturo E. Brillembourg of Washington, was married Saturday evening to George Thomas Chopivsky III, the son of Laryssa Courtney and George Chopivsky Jr., both also of Washington. Msgr. Nestor S. Kowal, a Ukrainian Orthodox priest, officiated at the vacation home of the bride’s parents in Easton, Md.

The bride, 30, will continue to use her name professionally. She is an associate in the Washington office of the Boston law firm Foley Hoag. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and received a law degree from Yale.

The bride’s father is the founder and chief executive of Farmington Asset Management, an investment advisory firm in Washington. Her mother is a founder and the chief executive of the Strategic Investment Group, an asset management firm in Arlington, Va.

The bridegroom, 33, is a vice president of Simpson Housing, a Denver real estate company. He works in Washington, where he oversees the development and operation of apartment buildings in the mid-Atlantic region. He graduated from Yale.

The bridegroom’s mother, now retired, was the founding director of the Washington Group, an association that promotes Ukrainian culture in the Washington area. His father is the chairman of the United Psychiatric Corporation, a company in Washington that owns and manages psychiatric hospitals and other mental health facilities.

From 1992 to 1994, the bridegroom’s stepfather, William H. Courtney, was the ambassador to Kazakhstan, and from 1995 to 1997 the ambassador to Georgia.
676 2009-06-21 Brooke Michelle McCracken and Christian Heim were married Saturday evening at the Ballantyne Resort in Charlotte, N.C. The Rev. Dr. Patrick Maloy, a minister ordained through the American Evangelical Christian Church, officiated at a nondenominational ceremony.

The bride, 24, and the bridegroom, 25, are associates at investment firms, she at Centerbridge Partners in New York and he at Greenbriar Equity Group in Rye, N.Y., where they analyze their firms’ investments and potential investments.

Mrs. Heim graduated from the University of North Carolina. She is a daughter of Stephanie and Scott McCracken of Charlotte.

The bridegroom graduated from Duke. He is the son of Elisabeth and Paul Heim of Interlaken, Switzerland.
677 2009-06-21 Jennifer Alessandra Carter, a daughter of Julia Vance Carter and Jason Carter, both of New York, was married Saturday at her mother’s weekend house in Southampton, N.Y., to Andrew Michael Peter Fleiss. He is a son of Karen Mandell Fleiss and Dr. David J. Fleiss, also of New York. Rabbi Dr. David M. Posner officiated.

Mrs. Fleiss, 25, received an M.B.A. this month from Harvard, and is a cum laude graduate of Yale. Her father is a commercial and residential real estate developer and manager in New York.

Mr. Fleiss, 31, is the vice president of Liberty Partners, a New York investment firm. He graduated from Amherst. His mother is the principal partner in KMF Partners, a hedge fund in New York. His father is an orthopedic surgeon in private practice, also in New York.
678 2009-06-21 Melissa Lynn Hull and Robert Druhan Geil were married Saturday in Southampton, N.Y. The Rev. Peter M. Larsen, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at St. Andrew’s Dune Church.

He is a son of Kit and Roger Geil of Mobile, Ala. His mother retired as a caterer in Mobile. His father retired as a senior vice president and a branch manager in Mobile for Regions Bank.
679 2009-06-21 FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — With gray skies still misting rain on Bethpage Black, the fog finally cleared long enough Saturday night for the United States Open to take shape. Against almost all odds, the second round was completed, the 36-hole cut was made and the third round got under way — albeit on squishy footing.

Defying a forbidding forecast of lightning, thunder and more drenching rain — much of which dissipated or skirted the already-soaked golf course — the Open reached the halfway point just after 4:30 p.m. The field was cut to the low 60 players, at four over par, and the third round began at 5:30.

The round was suspended after less than two hours, but that it started at all was almost as surprising as the identity of the halfway leader, Ricky Barnes at eight under, and the position of some of the pretournament favorites, like Tiger Woods, who was in a tie for 34th at three over par.

Sunday’s weather is expected to be similar to Saturday’s, with forecasts calling for scattered and occasionally heavy showers beginning in the afternoon. Play, which was scheduled to resume in the morning, has been postponed until 12 noon, with 16 players — including the top golfers after 36 holes — yet to begin the third round.

Barnes burst into the lead Saturday morning by adding three birdies in nine holes to the two he had made Friday for a bogey-free round of 65 that put him at eight-under 132. Barnes, who has not won a tournament since his victory in the 2002 United States Amateur, had not only the lead but also the lowest 36-hole total in United States Open history.

Was the 28-year-old Barnes as surprised as everyone else?

“At having the 36-hole lead in the U.S. Open? Yes. At playing well? No,” he said. “I’ve had a good year on the Nationwide Tour, with nine top 10s, and I’ve been working hard on my game.”

The combined forces of the United States Golf Association and the maintenance staff at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course have been laboring to get the Open completed on time. Although there was more rain overnight Friday, the course was in amazingly good condition for the 7:30 a.m. start of play Saturday. More than 11 hours of play was completed before the tournament was suspended at 7:09 p.m.
680 2009-06-21 WASHINGTON  President Obama, striking a forceful tone, said that he will fight for his package to reform the financial regulatory system  unveiled on Wednesday  as he tried to drum up support for his proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency.

In his weekly radio address aired Saturday morning, Mr. Obama promised to battle what he called special interests and to push hard for regulatory reform.

“The American people sent me to Washington to stand up for their interests,” he said. “And while I’m not spoiling for a fight, I’m ready for one.”

He took another punch at Washington and Wall Streetas he has been doing in the past, and characterized the need for regulatory reform as “necessary to end” the economic crisis now facing the country.

“As we continue to recover from an historic economic crisis, it is clear to everyone that one of its major causes was a breakdown in oversight that led to widespread abuses in the financial system,” Mr. Obama said. “An epidemic of irresponsibility took hold from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street. And the consequences have been disastrous. Millions of Americans have seen their life savings erode; families have been devastated by job losses; business large and small have closed their doors.”

The plan the president announced on Wednesday would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. It would separately expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Cooperation to seize and break up troubled financial institutions. And it would create a council of regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to fill in regulatory gaps.

In doing so, the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has grown up outside the government’s purview, and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large, troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail.

The Consumer Financial Protection Agency would require banks, mortgage lenders and credit card companies to provide consumers with a more nutritious diet, financially speaking. But the banking industry, which says it stands to lose billions of dollars, is bracing for a fight as the administration’s plan to overhaul the way the industry is regulated heads to Capitol Hill.

Banking officials have complained that the scope of the agency is too large. Obama administration officials, for their part, argue that banking regulators in the past have had an inherent conflict of interest between ensuring the safety and soundness of institutions and protecting consumers.

“It is true that this crisis was caused in part by Americans who took on too much debt and took out loans they simply could not afford,” Mr. Obama said. “But there are also millions of Americans who signed contracts they did not always understand offered by lenders who did not always tell the truth. Today, folks signing up for a mortgage, student loan, or credit card face a bewildering array of incomprehensible options. Companies compete not by offering better products, but more complicated ones  with more fine print and hidden terms. It’s no coincidence that the lack of strong consumer protections led to abuses against consumers; the lack of rules to stop deceptive lending practices led to abuses against borrowers.”
681 2009-06-21 FASHION glossies may be in the doldrums, but you’d never know it at the Magazine Alive shop, a collaboration between Vogue Nippon and the Comme des Garçons designer, Rei Kawakubo.

For the next six months, each issue will come to life at the Comme retail gallery in the Aoyama district of Tokyo. The shop made its debut with the July issue devoted to Manga X Mode. The entire top floor was taken over by Takashi Murakami merchandise based on the anime legend Magical Princess. Elsewhere, there were T-shirts with anime images of fashion icons like Donatella Versace.

Sadly, there was none of Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld, who created the front-window mannequin fantasy (left).
682 2009-06-21 Mr. Rafferty quotes a crucial line from Graham Greene’s “Brighton Rock” but does not explain the context for American readers unfamiliar with the original.

“Bite all the way down and it still says Brighton,” says Ida Arnold, a character in the film and the original novel. Brighton rock is a form of stick candy, usually with a bright exterior and a white interior with the word “Brighton” in red capital letters extruded through the length of the candy, so that no matter where one bites or breaks it, the city’s name is visible.

The line is more pointed than Greene meant it to be, since there is no longer anything Brightonian about Brighton rock. Other seaside towns in Britain have the same stick candy, with their own names printed within the center.
683 2009-06-21 Re “Go Ahead, Play With (and on) the Art” by Carol Kino [June 14]:

After reading the article on Jessica Stockholder’s installation and watching the audio slide show, I was surprised and upset to see no mention of the field of landscape architecture.

Everything that Ms. Stockholder mentions in the audio slide show — the connection of the city grid to the design and the dialogue between natural and constructed elements — is almost identical to what is currently being taught in the landscape architecture department at Harvard Graduate School of Design, where I am enrolled.

I would like to know why the term “landscape architecture” is missing from this article.
684 2009-06-21 “This is the first Yogo- BerrY to open in New York State,” the owner, Joanne Lee, informed us, clearly proud of this tiny, trim and jolly shop, which opened three weeks ago. The line on a recent evening snaked out the door, but those who were waiting were patient and smiling about this new spot, especially welcome in summer, the peak season for creamy, cold swirls.

Done in sorbet shades of cool lime and raspberry, the place is a beacon on a block anchored on one end by an auto dealership and on the other by an Asian grocery.

Activity hums in the bright shop, as four machines churn out YogoBerrY’s nonfat “original tart frozen yogurt.” Flavors change, but at the moment, chocolate, vanilla, green tea and plain come ready to be taken neat or teamed with one or more of the many toppings under the glass counter. These include coconut, nuts, mochi and a variety of fresh fruits like raspberries, strawberries, pineapple, kiwi, bananas and mango.

Portions are sold in paper cups that hold 6, 8 or 12 ounces and cost $3, $4 and $5, respectively. Add $1 for one topping, $1.49 for two and $2 for three. Smoothies are available as well, as are special waffles: two waffles with frozen yogurt and one topping are $5.

YogoBerrY, 764 Central Park Avenue, Scarsdale, (914) 472-2598. Open every day, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Credit cards accepted. General product information: yogoberryusa.com.M. H. REED
685 2009-06-21 The Aura and Malibu are so-called mild hybrids, which makes them as authentic as supermarket salsa. To keep the price down, the Malibu forgoes the things that let full hybrids generate impressive mileage: a large electric motor that can propel the car with no help from the engine, a sizable battery pack and a continuously variable transmission to efficiently mix and match electric and gas power.

Instead, the Malibu adopts a simple motor-generator driven by a wide engine belt and connected to a small nickel-metal-hydride battery pack in the trunk. Like other hybrids, the Malibu recharges the batteries by capturing energy generated by coasting or braking.

Unlike full hybrids, the system delivers only supplementary squirts of electricity; aside from automatically shutting down and restarting at stoplights, the engine is always on duty. The Malibu also gains a bit from a taller rear-end gear ratio that lets the engine spin slower at highway speeds.

The car, which starts at $26,275, has a federal rating of 26 miles a gallon in town and 34 on the highway. That’s solid mileage for such a roomy, comfortable sedan. The problem is that the conventional 1LT 4-cylinder with an optional 6-speed transmission is nearly as economical at 22/33 m.p.g. and costs $2,325 less, comparably equipped. The feds estimate that the hybrid will save you — wait for it — just $146 a year in fuel compared with that 4-cylinder sibling. Even accounting for a one-time $1,550 tax credit, this hybrid won’t put you in the black through fuel savings.

That wouldn’t matter as much if the Malibu Hybrid felt smoother, quicker or more advanced than the straight-up gas version. But it drives worse, not better.

The gas pedal and 4-speed transmission misinterpret messages from your right foot, making it hard to hold a steady speed or accelerate smoothly. The result is a queasy sensation of surging and relaxing, especially in heavy traffic and hilly terrain. Drop off the gas to coast, even at freeway speeds, and the clumsy power-regenerating mode makes the car feel as if it is dragging an anchor.

Because of the batteries, the hybrid also has slightly less trunk space: 13.3 cubic feet compared with 15.1 for the standard model.

The Chevy lacks another compelling feature: an animated display screen to coach you to drive more efficiently. Instead, a dull microwave-oven readout shows the trip mileage and an Eco light comes on when you’re coasting. A small indicator shows when the 2.4-liter, 164-horsepower engine is sleeping, and a gauge shows whether the batteries are charging or assisting the engine.

It’s as though G.M. would rather not focus attention on the underachieving system under the hood.

These days, offering a hybrid without an engaging system display is like building Yankee Stadium and forgetting the scoreboard. In either case, you want digital fireworks to celebrate the home team’s performance. That’s what the superior Ford Fusion Hybrid does, with a screen that affirms the owner’s enviro-shrewdness even as it helps her to achieve maximum mileage — in the Ford’s case, a knockout 41 m.p.g. in the city.

Doing my best slow-lane imitation of a Prius driver, I managed a respectable 28 m.p.g. in overall city-highway driving in the Chevy, just below the E.P.A.’s combined estimate of 29 m.p.g.

If you are not already scared off by G.M.’s sudden abandonment of this hybrid, the upside is that Malibu Hybrids were being sold at fire-sale prices even before the cancellation. G.M. has pledged to improve its mild-hybrid system and bolt it into yet-unidentified models next year — small consolation to existing owners.

Oddly, while G.M. may win the race to mass-market a plug-in hybrid (the Chevy Volt), it can’t seem to build a conventional hybrid to save its endangered life. Perhaps G.M. should take a lesson from the Toyota Prius: sell a hybrid as a loss leader until the technology finds a critical mass of buyers. Those buyers become unpaid spokesmen, bragging to anyone who’ll listen about their wonderful Chevy hybrid.

What G.M. would ultimately gain in buyers and public image might be as valuable as, oh, a spare couple of billion dollars in government aid.
686 2009-06-21 A HUSBAND and wife are in the kitchen of their Los Angeles home one day, talking. Not arguing; just talking. The wife is chopping a carrot; just  chopping a carrot. Their conversation is spurred by that familiar question: You know what would make a great television show?

First of all, enough already with mobsters and men with guns. How about a fresh comedy, with a male protagonist who is just a regular guy, a high school teacher, maybe, who coaches basketball? And what if his marriage had broken up, and he had no money, and the local economy was tanking?

The carrot-chopping wife, Colette Burson, then says: And what if he had nothing going for him except that he had a really big penis?

Actually, Ms. Burson used another term that cannot be published here. In fact, such effort is being made here to write this story without violating propriety  or without slipping in a few sophomoric double entendres  that the words being muttered at this very moment make Ms. Burson’s original term seem almost Psalm-like.

Now back to the kitchen conversation. So Ms. Burson says, wouldn’t it be great if the down-on-his-luck-regular-guy protagonist had a big penis? To which her husband, Dmitry Lipkin, immediately gives a name to this imaginary show: “Hung.”

These two professional writers giggle, eat their raw salad with chopped-up carrots  and before long sell this concept to HBO. Next Sunday will offer the premiere of a comedy about a teacher in Michigan. Once a star athlete who seemed destined for success, he is divorced, separated from his children and so financially strapped that he is camping outside the fire-damaged home inherited from his parents. Heeding the words of a motivational speaker, he vows to capitalize on his greatest asset (see above) and decides to become a male prostitute.

HBO is banking on this show to become a breakout hit. Not just a niche-market gem like “Flight of the Conchords” or a critical (but ratings-challenged) darling like “In Treatment,” but something that speaks to the national mood, a “Sex and the City” for both sexes that would cement the reputation of a relatively new management team at the cable channel. It is the first show to be nurtured from conception by Sue Naegle, the president of HBO’s entertainment division; she started championing the “Hung” proposal the moment she assumed the job 13 months ago.

Michael Lombardo, the president of HBO’s programming group and West Coast operations, admits to having a “multitude of reactions” when he first heard the show’s proposed name, which he acknowledges comes with its share of marketing challenges. “It diminished my expectations about what was to follow,” he said. “At the same time it was clearly provocative and it piqued my interest. Then I read it and I fell in love with the script.”

Ms. Burson, 40, a playwright, and Mr. Lipkin, 42, the creator and head writer of the “The Riches,” the canceled FX show about con artists on the lam, discussed the show’s evolution during a recent three-way telephone conversation, with Mr. Lipkin in Los Angeles and Ms. Burson in Detroit, where another episode was being filmed. These partners in life and in writing prefer to be interviewed together, which made for a lot of talking over each other.

But they talked as one in saying that  the name notwithstanding, a name they never once considered changing  their show is more than a mischievous one-liner. Yes, at first it was a joke. Whenever people asked what project they were working on, they would matter-of-factly say: “We’re working on a show called ‘Hung.’ It’s about a guy with a really big penis.”

Gradually, though, the couple realized the possibilities of this throwaway joke, and together they developed the characters and plot. They explore economic pressures and male-female relationships, while trying to answer the question: Who would you find if you tracked down the Big Man on Campus some 20 years after his high school graduation?
687 2009-06-21 When the Sign — all 550-odd rooms of it — opened last year, it was declared the biggest hotel in Stockholm. Could it also be the most Scandinavian? Having visited Norway, Iceland, Sweden (twice now) and Ikea stores in several continents, I feel I’ve amassed the requisite authority to say: Quite possibly! The Sign, part of the Clarion hotels chain, comes across as a sort of overblown diorama of the Scandinavian sensibility. The sleek lobby is decorated with Arne Jacobsen chairs, some with a shape — that clean, chilly apostrophe — that’s instantly recognizable. And at the sprawling free breakfast buffet, I confronted four kinds of pickled herring. Decisions, decisions.

If your goal is the easiest, most rapid transition from high-speed airport train to check-in, the Sign can’t be beat. It’s a few blocks — a walk of five minutes, tops — from the train’s terminus. Although it faces a pretty square, its situation is ultimately more functional than fun or romantic. The main business and high-end shopping districts are closer than the oldest part of the city or than Sodermalm, where some of the more popular restaurants and interesting shops are.

Our standard room was small, its humble dimensions underscored by the vastness of the glass-and-steel building in which it’s tucked and the endlessly long hallway to it. And the combined closet-and-dresser unit inside it was an impossibly slender caricature of space maximization. Still, there was a desk whose surface easily accommodated a laptop — the room had wireless — and a stunning contemporary chair upholstered in bold orange fabric. Along with a flat-screen TV opposite a bed with fluffy pillows and duvets, the chair lent a needed dash of flash to an otherwise plain environment.

Like the room, compact. The stall shower (no tub) had a gleaming glass door that looked spiffy but kept getting stuck against the floor, so that the soggy person trapped inside occasionally had to rally the drier person outside to the cause of liberation. And who nixed the toiletries? There was a dispenser with liquid soap, but no moisturizer, conditioner, Q-tips — nothing else.

Off the lobby is the first Scandinavian branch of the acclaimed Manhattan restaurant Aquavit, whose chef, Marcus Samuelsson, was reared in Sweden. Many floors above, facing a broad channel of water on the hotel’s opposite side, is a spa and fitness center with first-rate equipment. While running (in place), I took in a handsome view of the cityscape, though I was charged a day rate of 95 kronor (about $12 at 7.82 kronor to the dollar) for the privilege.

Although you can order round the clock, the menu is limited, the dishes pricey — for example, 145 kronor for a burger — and there’s a 90 kronor delivery charge. My light lunch of fruit salad and coffee arrived promptly, but the coffee came in a modular pitcher as confusing as it was attractive. I spilled half of it on the floor.

The location, the bevy of international newspapers in the lobby, the crisply efficient service and the well-dressed diners at breakfast make clear that this is foremost a business hotel. But there’s just enough of what, in Scandinavia, passes for whimsy — check out the black toilet paper in the lobby bathroom — to liven things up. A standard double without a view starts around 1,500 kronor in the best of circumstances but generally rises from there depending on availability and the time of week or year.
688 2009-06-21 Half a millennium later, what struck me and my wife as we drove toward Urbino was its rugged remoteness. You approach the city (by car or bus only; there’s no rail service) on tortuous two-lane roads that skim the margins of grain fields pitched like ski slopes. When the town heaves into view, it looks like something a Cubist craftsman assembled out of an infinite supply of buff-colored bricks — city walls, looming palace with dainty dunce-capped twin towers, black-domed cathedral, hive of houses — all of it roofed in terra cotta and fitted together like an intricate tan puzzle.

We parked outside the city wall and headed for the Ducal Palace, striding through narrow streets lined with cafes and loud with students enrolled at the city’s ancient university. We found the oddly unimposing portal at the rear of the palace, darted through rooms devoted to an archaeological museum, and finally emerged in the miraculous interior courtyard called the Cortile d’Onore, or Court of Honor.

After the gorgeous chaos of the surrounding countryside and the crabbed medieval cityscape, the cortile is like the single crystalline equation emerging from a chalkboard of squiggles. White Corinthian columns joined by arches define a rectangle of noble proportions; Latin text inscribed in the stone proclaims the “justice, clemency and liberalism” of the palace’s builder, Duke Federico da Montefeltro, Duchess Elisabetta’s father-in-law.

Tall, dark windows centered above the arches draw the eye upward and the mind inward to muse on the ideal beauty of the place. Here, distilled in stone, brick and geometry, is the quintessence of the Italian Renaissance.

The ladies and gentlemen who strolled through this courtyard 500 years ago would have been richly but soberly dressed, preferably in black — “more pleasing in clothing than any other color,” Castiglione wrote. “For my part,” intoned one of his fashion connoisseurs, “I should prefer [courtiers’ dress] not to be extreme in any way, as the French are sometimes in being over-ample, and the Germans in being overscanty.” They would have been graced with beautiful teeth (“very attractive in a woman”) but the good sense not to “laugh without cause solely to display” them.

Adept alike at the gentle pursuits of music and dancing and the serious business of war and hunting, the duchess’s guests were masters of what Castiglione called “that cool disinvoltura,” or ease, which made them “seem in words, in laughter, in posture not to care” and which caused “all who are watching them to believe that they are almost incapable of making a mistake.”

Even if they behaved only half as elegantly as Castiglione made out, it must have been quite a party. Certainly the setting was incomparable. Castiglione boasted (modestly) that Urbino’s ducal palace was “thought by many the most beautiful to be found anywhere in all Italy,” with “countless ancient statues of marble and bronze, rare paintings and musical instruments of every sort” and a vast library.

Sadly, two generations after Federico’s death in 1482, the Montefeltro family lost control of Urbino, and in time the bulk of the palace’s treasures and all of its books were carried off to Rome and Florence. Today, the visitor (group tours are offered only in Italian; English-speakers proceed at their own pace) will find that carved door lintels, ceiling medallions, fireplace mantels, a couple of chests and Federico’s huge painted box of a bed are pretty much all that remain of the original décor.

The one glorious exception is the small private study in the duke’s suite — the Studiolo — a masterpiece of trompe l’oeil intarsia (inlaid wood) so ingenious and exact you’re tempted to pluck an apple from the basket of fruit perched by a window (a similar intarsia studiolo taken from Federico’s palace in Gubbio is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York). The other rooms around the Court of Honor have been whitewashed and repurposed as a museum of medieval and Renaissance art. The collection’s masterpieces — Raphael’s incomparable portrait of a melancholy beauty, “La Muta,” and Piero della Francesca’s humble, dusky “Madonna of Senigallia” and surreal, puzzling “Flagellation of Christ” — are ghostly reminders of how dazzling this court once was.

Until July 12, there is an added inducement this year to visit: the duchess’s suite, including the Room of the Vigils, where Castiglione’s book is set, has been hung with an international show of Raphael’s work. William Butler Yeats, in a poem touching on those long-ago conversations, conjured up a room “where the Duchess and her people talked/The stately midnight through until they stood/In their great window looking at the dawn.”

The house in which Raphael was born and raised, a 10-minute walk from the Ducal Palace, is worth a visit even though it has only one original work attributed (by some) to him — a touching little fresco of the Madonna and child painted most likely in boyhood. Raphael’s father, Giovanni Santi, was himself an esteemed painter at Federico’s court, and his house exemplifies the considerable style and comfort in which even moderately successful families lived under the duke.

At the top of Via Raffaello, a short stroll (left) along the city wall leads to a gate in the side of a massive bastion — up the stairs are the ramparts of Fort Albornoz and a splendid panorama of town, ducal palace and surrounding countryside.

DUKE FEDERICO, who lived from 1422 to 1482, was a fabulously successful condottiere — in essence a Renaissance mercenary — so feared that he was paid not to fight. He amassed a great fortune and lavished it on the finest artists and architects of the day.

If you’ve got a car, really the only way to tour the region, you’ll want to make long, leisurely loops through the satellite towns and supremely beautiful countryside that Federico controlled. We started with Urbania, 10 miles from Urbino on a literally breathtaking road of hairpin turns and drop-dead views. The town’s majolica industry has resurged in recent years, and a handful of shops in the historic center offer intricately painted ceramics at fairly reasonable prices.

The Barco Ducale, the Duke’s stately domed hunting lodge, stands in a lush green field outside town. Back in the day, the surrounding country was walled for miles and planted with greensward and oak groves where poets and humanists idled away the drowsy summers. Today the building is locked and neglected.

Another stretch of divinely unspoiled country separates Urbania from Acqualagna, 11 miles to the southeast, and here we picked up a highway to Gubbio, Duke Federico’s birthplace, 22 miles farther south and just over the line in Umbria. Gubbio’s ducal palace feels more like a fortress than Urbino’s, and few of its decorative touches remain, but its views of rooftops and hills are fantastic.

Gubbio itself, to my mind, is more appealing than Urbino — quainter, quieter, catering more to tourists than to students, and chockablock with tempting ceramics shops. With more time and money, it would have been fun to play courtier at the Hotel Relais Ducale, the former guest quarters of the ducal palace, converted in 1997 into a luxury hotel.

But we ate like royalty at Cà Andreana, the charming old farmhouse turned country inn where we stayed just outside of Urbino. These days, a different kind of Renaissance is unfolding amid the “fertile and bountiful countryside” that Castiglione celebrated in his book. Chefs, bakers, cheesemakers, meat curers, fruit and vegetable growers, truffle purveyors, wine and olive oil producers are the artists working most creatively today in the old demesne of the Montefeltros.

Were he to return from Renaissance heaven, Castiglione would surely judge our manners coarse, our conversation lacking in wit and our clothes unspeakable — but I suspect that even he would be impressed by the fare we dined on in a cozy, humble inn a stone’s throw from the city he immortalized.

689 2009-06-21 “It’s Disneyland for campers,” said Jim Rogers, the chief executive of Kampgrounds of America, one of the country’s oldest operators of private campgrounds, which has been adding free Wi-Fi, espresso bars and air-conditioned cabins to some of KOA’s 450 parks.

Mr. Rogers likens the evolution of campgrounds in recent years to the amenity creep in the hotel business. Just as hotels have added free cocktail hours, fluffy beds and spas to attract clients and get them to stay longer, he said, campgrounds too have been “ratcheting up the value” with new features and services.

The Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA in La Selva Beach, Calif., is the home of an espresso bar, but also has miniature-train rides, outdoor movies, a mechanical bull and a giant outdoor Jumping Pillow (sort of a cross between a trampoline and a bouncy castle).

In Kimball, Mich., the Port Huron KOA features an in-line skating rink, batting cages, bumper boats, an ice cream parlor and seven playgrounds.

And Yogi Bear’s Jellystone Park in North Java, N.Y., just added a 16,000-square-foot water playground with water slides, water cannons and other spray features to its long list of kid-oriented attractions.

Not unlike hotels, which offer different room types at different prices, private campgrounds have been expanding their lodging options. The Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA, where tent sites cost about $60 a night, has RV sites (from $75), 50 air-conditioned cabins (from $115) and 13 lodges that can sleep six and have a small kitchen, dining area, bathroom and central air and heat (from $225). In April, the campground added six Airstream trailers that sleep a family of four for $150 a night.

Also like hotels, KOA introduced its Value Kard Rewards program, last year, allowing repeat campers to earn points redeemable for savings on their next visit.

“We’re campers in name only at this point,” said Bob Mills, a retired firefighter from Stockton, Calif., who parks his 30-foot trailer stocked with, as he puts it, “every luxury known to man” at the Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA for a few weeks each summer to spend time with his daughters, Lisa, 15, and Julie, 12.

After rolling out of their bunks each morning, Lisa and Julie may take a ride on the motorized Fun Train, race around on three-wheeled recumbent bikes or hit the heated swimming pool with friends. In the evening, they’ll meet up with Dad for dinner — pizza delivered straight to their campsite — and the requisite campfire with s’mores, before turning into their comfy bunk beds inside the trailer.

All of this may elicit a swift roll of the eyes from hard-core campers, used to pitching a tent deep in the woods and relying purely on nature for entertainment. But the “camping lite” travelers offer no apologies.

“I like to camp two hours a day,” said Scott Crompton, owner of Yogi Bear’s Jellystone in North Java. “Then I retreat into my motor home with every amenity there is.”

His staff caters to campers like him with a roster of activities, food delivery, people who will park your RV for you and a fleet of golf carts campers can rent for $50 a day to cruise around the 100-acre park. “Certainly nobody is rubbing two sticks together to make their own fire,” he said.

The recent surge in amenities at private campgrounds partly grew out of the rise of the RV business, as ownership grew by 15 percent from 2001 to 2005, with more than eight million households owning a recreational vehicle. As droves of baby boomers snapped up increasingly fancy motor homes over the previous decade, they sought out campsites that could not only handle the increasing need for electricity and water these vehicles required but that also matched the plush interiors of their RVs.

Campgrounds soon found out that the more amenities and services they provided, the more they could charge.

“The objective is to maximize dollars,” said Bud Styer, a camping consultant who owns and manages several RV parks and campsites in Wisconsin, including Smokey Hollow. “If I have 100 sites and I’m charging $10 a night, that’s $1,000. If I add an amenity, I can charge $15 more a night. The return on investment is staggering.”

The campsites at Smokey Hollow cost about $45 a night on average and include access to the swimming pond and other water features. Campers can pay an extra $25 a person for a V.I.P. wristband for unlimited weekend use of the miniature golf course, pedal carts, the Jumping Pillow and other amenities.

But even at these rates, a weekend of camping can still be more affordable than staying at a hotel or motel — especially if you cook your own food — a point the industry expects to bank on during the recession. So far this year, Mr. Styer said, business is up about 12 percent across his four campgrounds.

“When the economy gets a little rough, camping usually gets better,” he said.

713 2009-06-22 But facing financial difficulties, this year’s event — the first without Mr. Walker, who died last summer — struggled to get off the ground.

“We had nothing — nothing — until about three weeks ago,” said John Eustice, a racing promoter who first began working on the Harlem race last year with Mr. Walker. “It wasn’t as though I was sitting on my hands. I was trying, trying, trying” to get sponsorships. “I owed this to David,” he added.

Mr. Eustice said he drummed up a late sponsorship — “Enough to make the race look good,” he said — after running into someone from Rockstar Games, the video game company, while riding around Central Park. Nevertheless, the professional portions of the event were removed from a national series of races because the prize money was too low.

Under Mr. Eustice’s direction last year, the mom-and-pop event became flashier, with Jumbotrons, live television and sponsors like Saab and Rock and Republic, a clothing company. The added glamour hinted at the 1920s era of New York cycling, but it also left many in Harlem with bruised feelings. “We bulldozed the race,” Mr. Eustice said.

He employed a lighter touch this year, not least because of a lack of money. But the real change, said Mr. Walker’s son, David C. Walker, who inherited the race from his father and was working with Mr. Eustice, was that the community was brought back in. “It’s a Harlem community race — and anything after that is icing,” Mr. Walker said.

The lack of Jumbotrons or serious prize money seemed not to deter the approximately 240 racers, who rode hard on a course that has been nicknamed the Skinscraper because of its high incidence of accidents. But Mr. Eustice, a professional champion cyclist in his day, dismissed the idea that the race is more treacherous than any other. “Skinscraper? Some of the local guys call it that, but you know what they need to do? They need to ride their bikes better.”

On Sunday, at least one rider went skidding across the pavement during a midrace sprint amid a wrenching shriek of metal on concrete.

“Stay down, stay down!” a spectator yelled as the pack parted like flowing water around him. An odor of burnt rubber wafted over the spectators as the rider limped off the road.

“That crash was so bad I can smell it,” said Elizabeth M. Marcello, a graduate student at Columbia University and fledgling bike racer, turning away from the course. Her boyfriend, another Columbia University rider, crashed at this race last year, she said.

In the early days, riders were often felled by debris left on the road or tossed there by onlookers. The very first year, a rider received a consolation prize after a bundle of wire got tangled in his wheel, causing a crash.

The neighborhood has changed a lot since then, said Richard Cox, an announcer for the race since the early 1990s and also an emcee for the national double Dutch competition. “See those brownstones over there?” he pointed across 121st Street to a row of stately buildings. “I’ve seen when the city was giving them away for a dollar.”

On the stoop of one of those buildings, Tiffany Dufu watched the race with her 4-month old daughter, Ekua, and 3-year old son, Kofi.

“I like taking my son out here so he can see the racing,” she said. “He’s already asking for a bike.”

That attitude would have pleased Mr. Walker, who wanted the race to bring families together, Mr. Cox said. “David did say that ‘the day I go is the day we still go on.’ ”
714 2009-06-22 Are product placements worthwhile? Marketers apparently assume so; 13 brands, including Budweiser and Wrigley, paid for placement in one movie alone, “Mr. Deeds” of 2002.

But no study has looked at whether product placements are actually correlated with improvements in the share prices of the companies that buy them — presumably the ultimate test of their worth.

A paper to be published in the Journal of Marketing finds that placement in a successful movie indeed correlates with increases in the share price of the featured brand’s owner on the opening day.

But this effect is weakened for violent movies, and movies where the placement is not announced in advance — possibly because investors have less time to process the information. Placements are also less valuable in critically acclaimed movies, perhaps because audiences are looking for an aesthetically pure experience.

Michael Wiles, a professor of marketing at Arizona State University who is one of the paper’s authors, said that placements were less effective when too many were crammed into a film. “You can have too much of a good thing,” he said. “As you put in more placements, each is worth less. There is a self-correction.” ALEX MINDLIN
715 2009-06-22 With more subscribers than ever flocking to its DVD-by-mail service, Netflix is one of the few companies prospering during the worst recession in 70 years. But another upstart called Redbox has emerged to give the company a run for its business.

In 2002, Redbox was just an incongruous experiment that McDonald’s restaurants had tried to expand beyond burgers.

McDonald’s strategy group tried selling everything from toilet paper to fancy sandwiches, but only the idea of DVD rental succeeded.

The group running Redbox grew from operating 12 of the DVD machines to about 900 in three years. Redbox today has more than 15,400 vending machines set up to dispense discs that rent for $1 a day in supermarkets and discount stores. In 2005 and 2006, Coinstar invested $37 million in Redbox; this year, Coinstar bought out McDonald’s and other investors for up to $25 million.

Redbox is opening an average of one kiosk an hour to lure consumers, which has Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, taking notice.

“By the end of the year, kiosks will likely be our No. 1 competitor,” Mr. Hastings said in a recent conference call. “There are already more kiosks in America than video stores.”
716 2009-06-22 One of these concerns companies in the new “too big to fail” category. Being one of these entities is supposed to be a dubious honor. For example, banks like Citigroup would get a higher implicit level of government backing than other institutions, but would pay for it by having to hold more capital and abide by other more stringent rules.

If the government can strike the right balance, the idea makes sense. But there’s potential for market distortions and for some financial firms to shop around for the friendliest regulator — a current practice that Mr. Obama wants to sweep away.

General Electric, for one, is already opposing this aspect of the plan, which could force it to offload its GE Capital finance arm. Whether companies should have no option about such a split, even with a transition period, is arguable — though in G.E.’s case, it might not be a bad idea for shareholders as well as taxpayers given that the finance unit has lately dragged down the value of the industrial business.

G.E. could also be affected by heavier regulation of so-called industrial loan corporations. These businesses have historically been regulated lightly because of their traditionally small size and limited purposes. But the administration argues they resemble banks and should be regulated as such. That sounds right, but companies that own such entities are already on the warpath.

Then there are the gaps in Mr. Obama’s plan, which are mostly fights deferred.

One is the future of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The right answer in a market-driven economy would be to have these flawed, state-sponsored behemoths wound down or broken up and sold. But they are politically powerful. Mr. Obama’s plan has effectively punted the issue.

There’s also a gap in the plan to bring privately traded derivatives under regulation. Which watchdog will take charge of these problematic products, and exactly how it will be done, isn’t clear. There are $450 trillion of these derivatives outstanding, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. In such a huge and lucrative market, the shortage of details looks like a recipe for hot tempers later.

It also remains to be seen how Mr. Obama’s instructions to accounting standard-setters will translate into action. His plan hints that they should consider allowing financial firms more leeway in how they value assets, especially in volatile markets, thereby making balance sheets less susceptible to market swings.

Yet the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States and its international counterparts are supposed to be cushioned from political pressure. Changing that would probably be a bad idea, because politicians would be too prone to bending the rules in tough times.

The administration’s lengthy “white paper” will throw up other battles too, including over the newly proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which some see as an unneeded layer of bureaucracy.

Mr. Obama has already backed off any serious consolidation of the confusing array of watchdogs. Now he has tried to pick his battles of substance, too. Whether he has done enough to get his big ideas through Congress — especially with a heavy agenda, including health care reform, vying for attention — is another matter. RICHARD BEALES
717 2009-06-22 ISTANBUL (Reuters) — Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was forced to cancel his trip to Greece over the weekend because of blood pressure problems, the deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, said Sunday. Mr. Arinc was quoted by the state-run news agency, Anatolian.

Mr. Erdogan, 55, had been scheduled to join hundreds of dignitaries for the opening of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens on Saturday night, but he informed the Greek government during the day that he could not attend.

“According to the doctors he was suffering from exhaustion and weakness after extremely hot weather, and this led to problems with his blood pressure,” Mr. Arinc said.

Mr. Erdogan returned to Istanbul on Saturday after an event in the western city of Izmir.

In 2006, Mr. Erdogan was taken to a hospital after fainting while keeping the Muslim fast of Ramadan. Doctors said at the time that the episode had been caused by low blood sugar and fatigue.
718 2009-06-22 “The Wedding at Cana” is the third in Mr. Greenaway’s series “Nine Classical Paintings Revisited,” which is being produced by Change Performing Arts, with Franco Laera as curator. The first visit, in 2006, focused on Rembrandt’s “Night Watch” in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The second, last year, involved a full-scale replica of Leonardo’s “Last Supper” at Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan (after a one-night projection on the actual fresco that raised art historians’ hackles).

Somehow I missed news of this ambitious project. In Venice for the biennale, and hearing that the Greenaway was worth seeing, I went not knowing what to expect, sat down with other visitors on the refectory’s cool marble floor, leaned back, looked up and, as the piece began, felt my jaw drop.

Palladio’s grand space came alive with images, music, words and animated diagrams and special effects that proceeded to parse from every possible angle the Veronese’s pictorial composition, social structure and drama, which is ostensibly about Jesus’ first miracle, the turning of water into wine, but is really about the lifestyles of the rich and aristocratic of 16th-century Venice. No part of the Veronese image actually moves, but the piece never rests. Close-ups of the faces in the painting, appearing on the side walls between Palladio’s great corniced windows, alternate with apparitional red diagrams of portions of the composition, seen as if from above. There are also subtitles for the whispered conversations that Mr. Greenaway has written for the 126 wedding guests, servants, onlookers and wedding crashers depicted by Veronese.

The conversations, which are signaled by red lines snaking through the crowd on the cloned image, are mostly banal and hokey: Renaissance snark covering real estate, fashion, traffic, the costs of feeding so many people, this new thing called the fork and the strange miracle worker. Jesus has shown up with his mother rather than a wife, and six followers who are fishermen, and positioned himself in the exact center of the event, which all causes quite a bit of sniffing among the other guests. But they like the post-miracle wine: “No cloudiness.” “It’s certainly got body.” “Tastes like a south-facing mountain grape.”

On the veranda above the feast the servants worry about the rising number of guests (800, not 500), the whereabouts of co-workers, the disposition of the new china and the dwindling supplies; they provide perhaps the most convincing sense of immediacy and material culture. The impact of the drama is amplified with some raging fire and a thundering downpour that lasts a tad too long, alluding to other biblical events.

But it is the formal and spatial parsing of the image, its figures, hefty architectural setting and deep vista that is most enthralling. Often familiar art historical ploys are used, but it is still amazing to see so many of them put through their paces so quickly and effortlessly and at actual scale.

In one sequence the figures are numbered and Jesus’ centrality is confirmed with a series of radiating red lines. In another, color drains from the image and the work’s grand spatial recession is measured in white lines on grisaille. There is a shift to stark white on black and the image rotates, so that we are once more above it. Different figure groups are highlighted: you see, for example, that the arrangement of Jesus and his party presages the Last Supper.

Different reactions to the miracle — skepticism, fear, devotion — are singled out. Details are brought forward, like the two men craning out from the upper reaches of the columned edifice who have, for eternity, their own overhead view. Or the meat carver whose knife is positioned directly over Jesus’ head.

To a certain extent all the digital manipulation works its own temporary miracles. Even the inane conversation begins to resemble things that might have floated through Veronese’s mind as he determined his figures’ attire, body language and facial expression. And instead of the usual art-history-lecture spoon-feeding of information, you have the illusion of seeing and thinking for yourself with heightened powers. The next stop should be the Louvre and the real thing.

Mr. Greenaway’s plans or hopes for the future include Picasso’s “Guernica,” Seurat’s “Grande Jatte,” works by Pollock and Monet, Velázquez’s “Meninas” and maybe even Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment.” Stay tuned.

A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Mr. Greenaway’s multimedia series as “Nine Classical Painting Revisited.” The title is “Nine Classical Paintings Revisited.”
719 2009-06-22 Colin Gee, a slight, slim man, appears at the start of his new work, “Across the Road,” dressed in neat khaki pants and a white shirt. His long face, with its large, mobile features, is discreetly whitened; his dark hair, side-parted and slicked across his head in an old-fashioned style. His resemblance to a Marcel Marceau-type figure, doubtless intentional, is reinforced by the small, subtle gestures and movements that accompany his spoken performance.

He appears framed by a band of gauzy fabric overhead and to each side, with additional sheer curtains layered behind. The set, exquisitely lighted to create soft sepia tones, evokes a child’s puppet theater, and Mr. Gee (who was once a principal Cirque du Soleil clown) appears like the traditional French puppet character Guignol, slightly too large for his setting.

This duality — the sense of looking at figments of the cultural past through a strongly contemporary lens — is one of the strongest features of “Across the Road,” which was performed last week at the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens. But it’s a duality that is hard to sustain, and in his hourlong one-man show, Mr. Gee doesn’t quite manage to transcend the rather plodding narrative that underpins the show.

That narrative is told through text projected overhead and snippets of film; it concerns a couple, Mark and Aoife, at odds over whether to sell a family farm. This strangely prosaic subject is exploded to some degree by Mr. Gee’s presence, as he slips between the filmy curtains to offer poetic, associative riffs on the ideas and emotions raised by the film and the text.

At first it’s tempting to try to follow Mr. Gee’s slightly mumbled, monotone words, spoken over an eerie electronic soundtrack punctuated by wordless song (by Erin Gee, Mr. Gee’s sister). But their aspirations to Gertrude Steinian sound patterns (“actions attract me, refraction, a fraction of her satisfaction, don’t retract”) soon become a somewhat numbing backdrop to Mr. Gee’s simultaneous, beautifully nuanced gestures.

With the curve of an arm, the twitch of a finger, the slight shift of a foot Mr. Gee can suggest infinite possibilities of physical language, intimate the subtleties of human feeling. But his deliberately contained range of movement, and the compelling visual quality of the work, aren’t quite enough to maintain interest through the ultimately predictable even-paced alternation of film and speech, narrative and nonsense.
720 2009-06-22 Mickelson, in particular, looks dangerous. He played the first and second holes of the final round aggressively, cutting the corner at No. 2 with a huge drive. His body language, and his bearing, exuded confidence, and he spoke like someone who was on a mission.

“I am one good round away,” he said. “I am one good round away.”

Mickelson, who shot a 69 in the third round, had renewed confidence after finishing with a 35-foot putt for birdie. He hit nine fairways in each of his last two rounds, and those he missed did not cause him a lot of trouble.

He has had fewer putts each round, from 31 to 28 to 27. Before the tournament, he said it would be won or lost, for him, on the greens.

Then there is Duval, who is so loose that he is bantering with the galleries. For a man who once hid behind his wraparound sunglasses and wrapped himself in a cocoon of silence, Duval is making eye contact and hitting shots with the same ease.

He has not won a tour event since his British Open victory in 2001, and he has not had a top-10 finish since 2002 at Las Vegas. And he has a chance to win the United States Open because he is hitting 70 percent of his fairways for the week and 66 percent of the greens in regulation.

How has it come to this?

“Well, work and practice,” Duval said. “And just a belief in the path I was on of putting my golf swing, I want to say back together, but not quite. Because I feel like I made it better. I feel like I made it more reliable than it was, and I know why it works the way it works and I know how it works. And I think that’s the difference from 10 years ago.”

Although the conditions were ripe for scoring, the squishing sound of charging footsteps was not often heard. In fact, it was Barnes who charged at the golf course and elicited roars from the large crowds that have begun to embrace him.

Barnes birdied the second hole in the third round to get to nine under par, and reached 11 under with an eagle at the fourth. For perspective, only three other golfers have reached double figures under par at the Open — Gil Morgan in 1992, Woods in 2000 and Jim Furyk in 2002.

When he made the turn at 10 under, Barnes was six strokes ahead of Glover and at least seven ahead of everyone else. And even after he dropped two strokes coming in, he had a swagger that said he was in control and ready to take on the challenges of the golf course and all challengers.

“You know, I’ll take it,” he said of his finish. “I’ll take a lead after 54 holes in any event, let alone the U.S. Open. So I’d like to go in and I’ll get a little rest, I’ll definitely cherish the good things I did. I got off to a really good start and obviously hope to do that later tonight if we get back out. And I’m swinging good.”

That is how quickly things change. About an hour later, Barnes was not swinging well. He was quick driving, and his pitch shot into the first green was fat. Open pressure can do that to a player, like Barnes, who has not won a golf tournament of any kind since the 2001 United States Amateur.

He may rediscover what he had. But the margin for error has shrunk. The Open finally started Sunday, the day it was supposed to finish. Monday should be worth the wait.

745 2009-06-23 For the Ford family, it was a gut-check moment — the kind that has led to splits in other famous business families, like the Bancrofts who owned Dow Jones until they sold it to the News Corporation of Rupert Murdoch.

The Fords have had their tense times, most recently in 2007 when a few family members tried — unsuccessfully — to hire a Wall Street firm to advise the family on possible exit strategies.

But as they have done for decades after their meeting last January, the Fords rallied behind the family’s appointed leader: William C. Ford Jr., a great-grandson of the founder and chairman since 1999.

He is also the face of the company in Detroit and much of the world, given the prominent role he played in advertisements during his tenure as chief executive.

“The last thing this company needs at this point is for the family to be difficult,” Mr. Ford said in an interview. “And rather than splinter, we have pulled together.”

With no apparent drama to distract its focus on the company, the family instead has made some of the riskiest moves of Ford’s recent history. For the first time, it went outside the auto industry for a chief executive, hiring Mr. Mulally from Boeing. Then it backed a plan to mortgage all of Ford’s assets to borrow $23 billion.

“People look to Alan. People look to Bill,” said David Hempstead, a lawyer who has advised the family for more than 30 years. “When Alan said, ‘I’ve got a plan and it’s going to work and we’re going to turn this thing around,’ these people believed him.”

So far, the decisions have paid off. The money that Ford borrowed has kept it solvent and independent, while G.M. and Chrysler have been pushed into bankruptcy protection. Ford has streamlined its global operations and set a new course toward making smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles.

G.M.’s managers must answer to a new majority owner, the federal government, which in turn hopes to sell off its stake to other investors. Chrysler executives are learning to work with the Italian automaker Fiat, which acquired most of its assets.

Ford’s top managers said they have no such worries about their controlling shareholders.

“These people are so steadfast,” Mr. Mulally said. “They believe in this company so much.”

The Ford family members own a special class of stock that gives them 40 percent voting control.

“I feel this is one of Ford’s greatest assets, and one that G.M. has never had,” said David L. Lewis, a business historian at the University of Michigan. “The family has been an oasis of stability through the years.”

The regular, quarterly meetings started after the death of Henry Ford II in 1987. The current generation — with 13 cousins, including Bill Ford — has brought its children into the fold. The meetings now include up to 35 family members.

“After my father died, people in the family needed to start talking,” said Edsel Ford II, a longtime Ford director and Henry Ford II’s only son. “The meetings have become like a call to arms.”

In all, five family members work in some capacity or serve on the board at Ford. Besides Bill and Edsel Ford, three fifth-generation Fords are on the payroll.

Elena, Edsel’s niece, is a rising executive who is currently director of global marketing. Her cousin, Alessandro Uzielli, son of Anne Ford, works in Ford’s Los Angeles office on projects involving the entertainment industry. And Edsel Ford’s oldest son, Henry Ford III, is also a full-time employee with the potential to one day join top management.

Mr. Uzielli, 42, said being a Ford comes with a “sense of honor and trust.” The last few months have been “very tough at times,” but not nearly enough to shake the family’s commitment.

In 2001, the family asserted its power by replacing the chief executive, Jacques Nasser, with Bill Ford, who had been chairman for two years.

By 2006, the company was floundering, and appeared to be in worse shape than G.M. Bill Ford sought family support to hire Mr. Mulally.

“No question, that was a time of high anxiety for us,” Bill Ford said. “There were lots of events playing out, all of which were very risky.”

Mr. Mulally’s vision for Ford included shedding brands and operations that Mr. Nasser had built up, and borrowing heavily to restructure. To help persuade banks to lend Ford the money, the company canceled its dividend, which cost family members tens of millions of dollars a year.

“Our plan required sacrifices from everybody, including the family,” Mr. Mulally said. “But they agreed to do whatever it took to save the company.”

In the spring of 2007, less than a year into Mr. Mulally’s tenure, some family members, including Bill’s sister, Sheila Hamp, and her husband, pushed to hire the Wall Street firm Perella Weinberg Partners, to advise them on long-term strategy — including possible mergers or even a sale.

But Bill Ford and Edsel Ford opposed the move, as did Elena Ford, Edsel’s niece. The family voted, and agreed with them.

Elena Ford said the family’s strength is rooted in open communications — “everybody can ask whatever they want,” she said — and unwavering support once decisions are made.

“We are going through uncharted waters and we’re going to stick to our plan,” she added.

Ford is still losing money — $1.4 billion in the first quarter alone — and its cash reserves are shrinking as auto sales have dried up for the entire industry. Even so, Ford family members said they could not envision any situation that would cause them to sell out.

“If this were just a financial investment, the family probably would have been out of it years ago,” Bill Ford said. “This is very much an emotional commitment.”

747 2009-06-23 INDUSTRY representatives would have you believe that the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act enacted last month spells the end of the credit card as we know it. President Obama’s proposal last week to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to enforce the law has increased the industry’s concerns.

But the example of cards issued by credit unions puts the lie to these claims. Credit unions largely conform to the new rules already, while profitably maintaining the basic features that users know and love.

The credit card act is under fire for limiting a number of fees commonly used in credit card contracts, like the charge for going over the credit limit and the increased interest rate that applies once a borrower has missed a payment. These changes might look like a boon for the average card user, but industry advocates claim that fees on delinquent borrowers subsidize the perks for those who pay on time. Take away the lucrative fees, the argument goes, and credit card issuers will be forced to ax free plane rides, slash generous credit limits and impose hefty annual dues for all.

Some in the industry even say that profitability would require issuers to charge interest from the moment of purchase, thus eliminating the grace period of interest-free lending that borrowers have long enjoyed.

These fears are largely unfounded. We have performed a study that compared credit cards issued by investor-owned banks to those issued by customer-owned credit unions. We found that credit unions are less likely to charge the fees and penalties that the new act hopes to eliminate — and when they do, they charge less than other issuers.

While virtually all banks and other for-profit issuers increase the interest rate if the borrower fails to make a minimum payment on time, most credit unions do not. Similarly, credit union fees for exceeding the credit limit are on average just half those of other issuers. But contrary to industry assertions, more responsible card users don’t pay the price. Credit union cards actually offer lower annual fees and longer grace periods than regular cards.
748 2009-06-23 A Congressional commission plans to issue recommendations on Tuesday for standards to reduce sexual assaults in the nation’s jails and prisons.

The commission cited an estimate by the Bureau of Justice Statistics that 60,500 state and federal prisoners were sexually assaulted in 2007.

Congress authorized the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission to conduct the study and to issue binding standards for corrections agencies that will have the force of law. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will have one year to codify anti-sexual assault procedures, and state governors will have an additional year to signal their compliance with those standards or risk losing up to 5 percent of federal financing for corrections.

The commission recommended that agencies improve training for prison and jail employees for better detection of assaults, do a better job of classifying vulnerable inmates, reduce jail and prison overcrowding, and improve medical and psychological services for victims of sexual abuse.

The commission also recommended stiffer penalties for correctional officials who tolerate or engage in abuse.
749 2009-06-23 The Supreme Court decided on Monday not to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a protection for the right of minorities to vote. That was very good news. The less good news is that the court, which has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of Section 5, said it raises serious constitutional concerns. The ruling may signal that the court will be tempted in a future case to strike down this important safeguard.

Congress enacted Section 5 to clamp down on election officials who use tactics like gerrymandering and closing polling places to suppress and dilute minority votes. It requires states and local governments to “preclear” changes in voting rules with the Justice Department or a federal court to determine whether they would harm minority voting rights.

The case the court considered was brought by a Texas utility district with an elected board. The district wanted to be removed from coverage by Section 5, or alternatively, for the court to hold Section 5 to be unconstitutional, because Congress overstepped its authority in passing it. A lower court rejected both claims.

Based on the questions the justices asked at oral arguments in April — always a risky gauge — it appeared as if the court might be poised to strike down Section 5. In the end, it took a narrower approach.

By an 8-to-1 vote, it ruled that the utility district should have been allowed to bail out from the requirements of Section 5. The lower court, it said, had read the bailout provision incorrectly. In keeping with its traditional reluctance to decide constitutional questions unless it must, the court said that it would not rule on whether Section 5 is constitutional.

But Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion laid the groundwork for possibly doing so in the future. It said, “We are now a very different nation” than more than 40 years ago when the Voting Rights Act was first upheld. “Whether conditions continue to justify” the act, the majority said, is “a difficult constitutional question.”
750 2009-06-23 Mr. Jobs was actually at work on Apple’s sprawling corporate campus on Monday, according to a person who saw him there. Company representatives would not say whether he had returned permanently.

Even senior officials at Apple fear crossing Mr. Jobs. One official, who is normally more open, when asked for a deep-background briefing about Mr. Jobs’s health after the news of the transplant had become public, replied: “Just can’t do it. Too sensitive.”

Secrecy at Apple is not just the prevailing communications strategy; it is baked into the corporate culture. Employees working on top-secret projects must pass through a maze of security doors, swiping their badges again and again and finally entering a numeric code to reach their offices, according to one former employee who worked in such areas.

Work spaces are typically monitored by security cameras, this employee said. Some Apple workers in the most critical product-testing rooms must cover up devices with black cloaks when they are working on them, and turn on a red warning light when devices are unmasked so that everyone knows to be extra-careful, he said.

Apple employees are often just as surprised about new products as everyone else.

“I was at the launch,” said Edward Eigerman, who spent four years as a systems engineer at Apple and now runs his own technology consulting firm. “No one that I worked with saw that coming.”

Mr. Eigerman was fired from Apple in 2005 when he was implicated in an incident in which a co-worker leaked a preview of some new software to a business customer as a favor. He said Apple routinely tries to find and fire leakers.

Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president for marketing, has held internal meetings about new products and provided incorrect information about a product’s price or features, according to a former employee who signed an agreement not to discuss internal matters. Apple then tries to track down the source of news reports that include the incorrect details.

Five years ago, Apple took its obsession with secrecy to the courts. It sued several bloggers who had covered the company, arguing that they had violated trade-secret laws and were not entitled to First Amendment protections. A appeals court ruled for the bloggers, and the company had to pay $700,000 in legal fees.

Apple also sued a blog called Think Secret and settled the case for an undisclosed amount, but as part of the settlement that blog shut down.

Regis McKenna, a well-known Silicon Valley marketing veteran who advised Apple on its media strategy in its early days, said the culture of secrecy had its origin in the release of the first Macintosh, which competitors like and knew about before it was unveiled.

“It really started around trying to keep the surprise aspect to product launches, which can have a lot of power,” Mr. McKenna said.

He added: “But what most people don’t understand is that Steve has always been very personal about his life. He has always kept things close to the vest since I’ve known him, and only confided in relatively few people.”

Apple’s decision to severely limit communication with the news media, shareholders and the public is at odds with the approach taken by many other companies, which are embracing online outlets like blogs and and generally trying to be more open with shareholders and more responsive to customers.

“They don’t communicate. It’s a total black box,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who has covered Apple for the last five years.

Mr. Munster said he jokes with other colleagues covering the company about how Apple routinely “jams the frequencies,” or gives them misinformation to throw them off the scent of a new product or other news it hopes to keep confidential. Four years ago, he said, a senior Apple executive directly told him the company had no interest in developing a cheap iPod with no screen. Soon after, the company released just that: the .

For corporate governance experts, and perhaps federal regulators, the biggest question is whether Mr. Jobs’s approach has led to violating laws that cover what companies must disclose to the public about the well-being of their chief executive.

On that key issue, the experts are divided. Some believe Apple did not need to disclose Mr. Jobs’s liver transplant because Mr. Jobs was on a leave of absence and had passed responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the company to the chief operating officer, .

Other governance experts argue that the liver transplant now makes one of Apple’s assertions from January — that Mr. Jobs was suffering only from a hormonal imbalance — seem like a deliberate mistruth, unless Mr. Jobs’s health condition suddenly deteriorated. Of course, no one knows enough to say definitively.

Most governance experts do seem to agree on one point: that the secrecy that adds surprise and excitement to Apple product announcements is not serving the company well in other areas.

“In this environment, where transparency is critical, the more information you give the marketplace the better,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the . “For a technology company that views itself as innovative, it’s a little odd that they are getting a reputation for lack of transparency.”

Apple’s stock dropped $2.11 to $137.37 on Monday amid a larger market sell-off. And the company did, in fact, have something to reveal: it said it had sold a million units of its new iPhone 3G S over the weekend, well above analysts’ forecasts.
751 2009-06-23 “The full, mandatory regulation of all derivatives dealers would represent a dramatic change from the current system in which some dealers can operate with limited or no effective oversight,” Mr. Gensler told the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment.

Congress may pass new derivatives laws with Mr. Obama’s regulatory overhaul this year. Ms. Schapiro said the S.E.C. was considering whether disclosure rules for stocks should apply to security-based derivatives that do not trade on exchanges. The agency also is weighing whether an equity swap tied to a company’s performance should be treated the same as holding the shares, she said.

“Similar products and activities should be subject to similar regulations and oversight,” Ms. Schapiro said. “The interchangeability of securities and securities-related” derivatives “means that they are driven by the same economic forces.”

Mr. Gensler focused on capital and margin requirements, saying they would prevent derivatives users like the American International Group from amassing “large or highly leveraged risks outside the oversight of prudential safeguards of regulators.” A.I.G. needed $182.5 billion in taxpayer aid because of credit-default swap trades on mortgage-linked securities.

Some lawmakers, including Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, want a more aggressive approach than the administration is backing. Mr. Harkin is pushing legislation that would require all over-the-counter derivatives trades to be cleared through a regulated exchange. That would subject the contracts to margin and collateral requirements.

Derivatives are financial instruments derived from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or tied to specific events such as changes in interest rates. Credit-default swaps were created to let banks hedge risks from loans. They became a popular way for hedge funds, insurance companies and other asset managers to speculate on the quality of debt or on the creditworthiness of companies because they were often easier and cheaper to trade than bonds.

The economy’s longest recession since the 1930s was set off when credit markets froze after banks found they could not determine the value of trades linked to mortgage bonds.

Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, Calif., advocated a ban in trading of credit-default swaps. Regulators are too cozy with the banks in the market to be counted on to make changes, he said.

The Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group, said forcing energy derivatives onto exchanges would raise the costs of hedging and reduce market liquidity. It called for imposition of reporting requirements instead.
752 2009-06-23 Charles A. Butler, a pharmaceutical analyst at Barclays Capital, the investment bank, said the drug industry was offering an olive branch to Congress and the White House, in contrast to its “vociferous disagreement” with President Bill Clinton’s proposals in 1993-94.

In an interview, Mr. Butler said he did not think the latest concessions would have “a material adverse impact” on drug company earnings. “Because of the discounts,” he said, “Medicare beneficiaries are likely to continue filling prescriptions in the doughnut hole, whereas in the past many stopped taking their medications because the drugs were unaffordable to them.”

Congress and the White House are frantically seeking ways to help pay for legislation securing coverage for all Americans. The cost of the bill could top $1 trillion over 10 years.

The lobby for drug companies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said it had pledged $80 billion over 10 years to help “reform our troubled health care system.” The commitment came in a deal with the White House and Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee.

Mr. Obama described the agreement as a “significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform.”

But Senate aides and drug company lobbyists said the $80 billion reflected total projected savings to the health care system and included unspecified future concessions, besides the drug discounts in the coverage gap.

Some of the $80 billion reflects savings to the government. Some reflects savings to older Americans. But all the savings from closing the doughnut hole would go to beneficiaries, not the government, Senate aides said.

Reid H. Cherlin, a White House spokesman, said: “Of the $80 billion, we estimate that $30 billion could be used for the doughnut hole and passed on to seniors. The other $50 billion could go to health care reform, but these savings have not been identified at the moment.”

The House bill would go further. It would gradually eliminate the coverage gap and require drug companies to pay rebates to the government on drugs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries.

Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the drug manufacturers group, said the industry’s $80 billion commitment would include “significant scorable savings to the government,” though details were not available.

Steven D. Findlay, a health policy analyst at Consumers Union, said: “It’s great that PhRMA has stepped up to the plate with a proposal to help lower seniors’ drug costs. But this still leaves the doughnut hole in place and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of seniors on the hook for drug costs they cannot afford. We hope Congress will eventually do away with the doughnut hole.”

Congressional reaction suggested that the industry’s voluntary price concessions had whetted the appetite of lawmakers for broader, deeper discounts.

Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said the $80 billion commitment amounted to “a modest percentage” of national spending on prescription drugs. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that drug spending will total $3.3 trillion over 10 years.

Even as Mr. Obama welcomed the new agreement, drug companies opposed another significant part of his agenda: a proposal that would prohibit brand-name drug companies from paying generic drug makers to delay the marketing of generic products, which often cost much less.

In his budget, Mr. Obama said such “anticompetitive agreements” kept generic drugs off the market. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said these deals would cost consumers tens of billions of dollars in the next decade.

A House subcommittee has approved a bill to ban such “pay-for-delay settlements.” A Senate committee is poised to approve a similar bill this week.

Mr. Leibowitz said, “Drug companies are lobbying furiously against the legislation because they want to preserve their monopoly profits at the expense of consumers.”

But Diane E. Bieri, executive vice president of the drug manufacturers association, said the settlements sometimes benefited consumers because they avoided litigation and allowed generic drugs to enter the market before drug patents expired.
753 2009-06-23 “They were much more engaged and successful on that front than we were,” said Mr. Baker, the former chairman of a subcommittee of the House Financial Services committee.

Donations in the industry have long been slanted toward Democratic candidates, and $11 million of last year’s nearly $17 million in donations were doled out to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

In the last two years, fund managers have also spent about $15 million on lobbyists, quadruple the amount they spent in past years.

The registration of hedge funds, as well as private equity firms, has figured prominently in discussions of reform for years. Mr. Baker himself wrote it into a bill back in 1999, after the near collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management prompted federal officials to broker a Wall Street-led rescue.

Mandatory registration has been discussed for so long, in fact, that many in the industry regard it as the issue to fight over to avoid other, more pressing matters.

“It’s a red herring,” said Robert Sloan, managing partner at S3, which helps hedge funds manage their positions. “What other business in the world doesn’t want to register its name and number, the mafia? The real issues are counterparties, leverage, shorting, derivatives and exchanges.”

The Citadel Investment Group has been focused on those issues. Kenneth C. Griffin, the Citadel chief executive, testified in Congress about derivatives trading on Monday.

People who study the industry wonder if the hedge fund operators can stick together. Two years ago, funds split into competing groups after disagreements about the Managed Funds Association’s positions.

One of the groups, led by James Chanos, the prominent short-seller who runs Kynikos Associates, was an early supporter of registration. The group, called the Coalition of Private Investment Companies, has put up Web sites recently to educate the public on hedge funds and short-selling.

Also two years ago, some hedge funds split away from the association into a group to fight proposals to change the so-called carried-interest tax, which allows partnerships to pay capital gains taxes on income they earn over time. That loophole — under debate again in this Congress — generates billions of dollars in gains to hedge funds and private equity firms.

The Tudor Investment Group, one of the few funds to have set up its own political action committee, was an ardent opponent of the change. An economist from Tudor, Robert McNally, toured Washington last year using his expertise on oil as an entree but steering conversations quickly to carried interest, according to Congressional staff members.

Other hedge fund chiefs have visited the Hill on their own lately. James Simons, the former mathematics professor who runs Renaissance, met with lawmakers from a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee this month. And lobbyists for the Private Equity Council, which is trying to differentiate its members from hedge funds, met recently with staff members on that same committee.

Mr. Baker’s association listed a dozen bills as being of interest in an April lobbying disclosure form, that put its lobbying spending at $750,000 a quarter. Since then, other issues have arisen, like hedge fund rules in Europe that hedge funds have asked the Treasury Department to oppose. A spokesman for the Treasury Department said the Treasury met not only with hedge funds, but with other groups as well.

Mr. Baker said in an interview that if the carried-interest tax loophole were closed, he would push for a delay before doing so.

He also said no hedge funds should be deemed “systemically important,” a designation that would open them to greater scrutiny under the Obama administration’s proposals. People who follow the industry dismiss his position as jockeying.

“It’s disingenuous for anyone to claim in this day and age that no hedge fund is systemically important,” said Andrew W. Lo, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied hedge funds for more than a decade. “Frankly I don’t think any hedge fund manager in his right mind could argue that the industry needs no oversight.”
754 2009-06-23 FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — As the wind billowed and blew golfers off course, Tiger Woods appeared to locate his compass on Monday. He found his way under par for the first time in the 109th United States Open with birdies at Nos. 13 and 14.

At one under for the tournament, Woods was finally headed in the right direction. Whereas he trailed by 11 strokes after 36 holes, he now was only four behind the leader, Lucas Glover.

But then came the par-4 15th hole, which he had had trouble navigating all week. He bisected the fairway with a drive that landed 175 yards from the pin. Firing at a pin tucked like a pocket handkerchief into the upper right portion of the green, Woods hit a 5-iron approach that landed in the rough behind the green. He chipped within eight feet of the cup but two-putted for bogey.

At the start of the day, Woods said, “I thought five was going to win it outright and four was playoff.” Alas, it was his most accurate read in a week when he averaged 30 putts a round. He finished in a tie for sixth, at par 280, four strokes behind Glover.

“To miss that many putts, I’ve missed them all week,” Woods said.

When Woods replays the tournament in his mind, he will fast-forward to the 15th, which he played in four over par.

“Unfortunately, I didn’t make anything,” Woods said. “I hit so many putts that my good ones are not going in, and then my bad ones aren’t even close.”

On the soft and bumpy greens, he added: “You have to be committed to hitting it that hard, and I left a lot of putts short. And then when I tried to hit it harder, I gunned it past the hole. I didn’t make the adjustments.”

Asked if he would beat himself up over his performance, he replied, “Yes.” His finish matched his showing at the Masters. But this effort felt worse because he felt he had knocked all the rust off his game after a nine-month hiatus because of knee surgery.
755 2009-06-23 JIUTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) —President Felipe Calderón warned governments on Monday not to let the economic crisis derail efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking at a meeting of representatives of the world’s biggest economies on how to tackle climate change, Mr. Calderón said the world was running out of time to take serious action to address global warming.

“The finger-pointing has gone on for more than a decade without humanity taking a single step forward in the fight against climate change,” Mr. Calderón said at the meeting, which was held in the town of Jiutepec in a picturesque valley near Mexico City.

He said the global recession could make talks over emission goals even more complicated. “If it is hard in boom times to agree to steps that have an economic cost, it will be even harder during a recession,” he said.

World leaders are expected to sign a new climate change treaty in Copenhagen in December that will introduce binding emissions targets for fast-growing developing nations, but rich and poor countries disagree on how far to cut emissions.

Mr. Calderón said that failure to reach an agreement would produce a deterioration of the environment that would cost nations more than if they spent now to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
756 2009-06-23 Opposition Web sites and television channels, which Iranians view with satellite dishes, have repeatedly shown the video, in which blood can be seen gushing from Ms. Agha-Soltan’s body as she dies. By Monday evening, there already were 6,860 entries for her on the Persian-language Google Web site. Some Web sites suggest changing the name of Kargar Street, where she was killed, to Neda Street.

Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition candidate for president in this month’s election, called her a martyr on his Web site. “A young girl, who did not have a weapon in her soft hands, or a grenade in her pocket, became a victim of thugs who are supported by a horrifying intelligence apparatus.”

Only scraps of information are known about Ms. Agha-Soltan. Her friends and relatives were mostly afraid to speak, and the government broke up public attempts to mourn her. She studied philosophy and took underground singing lessons — women are barred from singing publicly in Iran. Her name means voice in Persian, and many are now calling her the voice of Iran.

Her fiancé, Caspian Makan, contributed to a Persian Wikipedia entry. He said she never supported any particular presidential candidate. “She wanted freedom, freedom for everybody,” the entry read.

Her singing instructor, Hamid Panahi, offered a glimpse of her last moments.

He said the two of them decided to head home after being caught in a clash with club-wielding forces in central Tehran. They stepped out of the car. “We heard one gunshot, and the bullet came and hit Neda right in the chest,” he said. The shot was fired from the rooftop of a private house across the street, perhaps by a sniper, he said. On a Facebook posting along with the video, an anonymous doctor said he tried to save her but failed because the bullet hit her heart.

“She was so full of life,” said a relative who spoke on condition of anonymity. “She sang pop music.”

The relative said the government had ordered the family to bury Ms. Agha-Soltan immediately and barred family members from holding a memorial service.

The paramilitary forces were quick to stop memorial services elsewhere, too. More than a dozen bearded men on motorcycles dispersed nearly 70 people gathered outside Niloofar mosque on Monday. Authorities ordered the mosques not to hold services for any victims of the demonstrations over the past few days.

“Go, get lost,” they shouted, as the regular police stood by.

But one police officer, watching the militia, said a prayer aloud with the crowd in her honor: “Peace be upon the prophet and her family.”

As Ms. Agha-Soltan’s family held a private ceremony on Monday, they turned reporters away and refused to speak. “They were not allowed to hang even a black banner,” the relative said.

Funerals have long served as a political rallying point in Iran, since it is customary to have a week of mourning and a large memorial service 40 days after a death. In the 1979 revolution, that cycle generated a constant supply of new protests and deaths.

But the narrative of death has also been important in the lore surrounding the existence of the Islamic republic.

The government portrayed itself in the role of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad killed by a far larger army during the seventh-century struggle within Islam, which gave birth to the Shiite sect that predominates in Iran.

Days for prophets and saints believed killed in the service of the faith dot the holiday calendar, taking up 22 days of the year.

So the very public adulation of Ms. Agha-Soltan could create a religious symbol for the opposition and sap support for the government among the faithful who believe Islam abhors killing innocent civilians.

One poem circulating on the Internet explicitly linked her death to other symbols of the protest movement:

Look at this city

At the shaken foundations of palaces,

They call us “dust,” and if so

Let us sully the air for the oppressor

She has become the public face of an unknown number of Iranians who have died in the protests. While state television has reported 10 deaths and state radio 19, it is widely believed the total is much higher.

A witness said the body of a 19-year-old man who was killed in Tehran on Sunday was given to the family only after it paid $5,000.

For many Iranians, though, the death of a young woman has special meaning.

“We know a lot of people have died, but it is so hard to see a woman, so young and innocent, die like this,” a 41-year-old who gave his name as Alireza said Monday.

Women were particular targets after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began to strictly enforce previously loosened restrictions. Thousands of women were arrested or intimidated because they did not adhere precisely to Islamic dress code on the streets.

Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leading opposition candidate, campaigned along with his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, and other prominent Iranian women rallied to his side as he promised to improve the status of women.

A woman called Hana posted a comment on Mr. Karroubi’s Web site: “I am alive but my sister was killed. She wanted the wind to blow into her hair; she wanted to be free; she wanted to hold her head high up and say: I am Iranian. My sister died because there is no life left; my sister died because there is no end to tyranny.”
757 2009-06-23 Sorry, Paul Simon. Kodak is taking Kodachrome away.

The Eastman Kodak Company announced Monday it would retire Kodachrome, its oldest film stock, because of declining customer demand in a digital age.

It was the world’s first commercially successful color film, immortalized in Mr. Simon’s song in 1973: “They give us those nice bright colors. They give us the greens of summers. Makes you think all the world’s a sunny day. ... So, Mama, don’t take my Kodachrome away.”

It enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s and ’60s, but in recent years sales have dropped to just a fraction of 1 percent of the company’s total sales of still-picture films.

“It really has become kind of an icon,” said Mary Jane Hellyar, the departing president of Kodak’s Film, Photofinishing and Entertainment Group.

The company, which is based in Rochester, now gets about 70 percent of its revenue from its digital business, but plans to stay in the film business “as far into the future as possible,” Ms. Hellyar said.

Kodak has seven new professional still films and several new motion picture films introduced in the last few years.

Kodachrome was favored by still and movie photographers for its rich but realistic tones, vibrant colors and durability.

It was the basis not only for countless family slide shows but also for world-renowned images, including Abraham Zapruder’s 8-millimeter reel of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.

The widely recognized portrait of an Afghan refugee girl that appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1985, taken by Steve McCurry, was shot on Kodachrome. At Kodak’s request, Mr. McCurry will shoot one of the last rolls of Kodachrome film and donate the images to the George Eastman House museum in Rochester, which honors the company’s founder.

Unlike any other color film, Kodachrome, introduced 74 years ago, is purely black and white when exposed. The three primary colors that mix to form the spectrum are added in three development steps rather than built into its layers. Because of the complexity, only Dwayne’s Photo, in Parsons, Kan., still processes Kodachrome film. The lab has agreed to continue through 2010, Kodak said.
758 2009-06-23 International migrant workers, foreign students and political refugees are often endangered by laws that discriminate against people with AIDS, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reported last week.

About a third of the world’s countries limit the right of people with H.I.V. to enter or stay, even if their disease is under control with drugs. Some restrict their access to health care.

The report describes how guest workers from poor countries like the Philippines and Sri Lanka working in wealthy ones like Saudi Arabia may be given mandatory H.I.V. testing  sometimes without their knowledge  and deported, often without being able to claim back wages and sometimes after imprisonment without treatment.

The group said the visa restrictions had led people to commit fraud or stop treatment, risking their lives. The report detailed one study in which travelers from Britain stopped taking their AIDS pills or tried to mail them ahead, sometimes unsuccessfully, out of fear that they would be denied visas to the United States if they admitted being infected, or would be searched at the border.

Wealthy countries often deport people without considering whether they will have access to medical care elsewhere, the report said. South Korea, for example, has deported hundreds of foreign workers, and some deportees from the United States, especially those with criminal records, have been jailed without treatment and died in custody.

The International Organization for Migration estimates 3 percent of the world’s population  192 million people  live outside the country where they were born.
759 2009-06-23 I was not afraid of birth either, but I was afraid of death. Thus far in my career, it had stayed neatly out of sight.

But today this stillborn needed to be delivered, and the safest course was to induce labor with Pitocin and deliver the baby vaginally. Barb, who was delayed in clinic, called me to review the case with me. She wanted me to go to “be with the mom.”

I entered the room and greeted the patient, whom I’d never met. The intravenous drip of Pitocin was already under way; the anesthesiologist had started the epidural. Medically, there was nothing more to be done. My job, as I saw it, was to cheer her up.

She was alone, her brown hair tied back into a messy ponytail, her gown bunched around her big protruding belly. But for the absence of the reassuring tick-tock-tick of the fetal heart monitor, this could be anyone’s happy day. I remember feeling relieved that she didn’t look unhappy. No tears, no rage, just the slightly dazed look of someone who accidentally wound up in the wrong place.

There was a chair in the corner, and I sat in it. The silent monitor spooled forth a strip of paper, one line showing rounded humps for each regular contraction. Without the noisy clatter of the fetal heart monitor, there was no sound but our breathing and the distant rumble of cars outside.

Not sure what else to do, I filled the silent birth room with the sound of my own voice. I told her all about my training in midwifery, my hometown, my likes and dislikes. I learned that she was a graduate student in crop management, that she grew up in Ohio, that we both liked a movie that had come out the week before.

The time dragged, the monitor spewed forth paper, and I kept chattering. I remember that I was proud of myself for coping with this difficult situation with diplomacy and tact.

I had been there for several hours when Barb arrived in a burst of energy. She wore faded jeans and flip-flops. Her jade earrings swung at the side of her neck. She threw her arms around the patient, hugged her a long minute, and then said, “I’m so sorry.”

My patient collapsed into uncontrollable tears. Barb sat on the edge of the bed, her hand on the patient’s arm, and they spoke in halting, slow, tearful words about the awful momentousness of what was happening. I sat in my chair in silent shock.

Death had been in the room but had been nicely hidden under the sheets, under our cheerful demeanor, under the silences of things left unsaid.

The baby arrived at last, and as Barb lifted the perfectly formed lifeless body, the cord unfurled to reveal a true knot. A rare, unpreventable accident.

Barb and I left the room so the mother could say her goodbyes. By then, the father had arrived, and they were in the room together. I never saw them again.

I said goodbye to the green nurse-midwife, the one who believed that providing support meant sitting in a corner pretending that death could be covered up with small talk.

I now know that birth and death are right around the corner from each other, and that as a midwife I may be charged with bringing either one into the world.
760 2009-06-23 Yannick Noah, a French tennis champion in the 1980s and ’90s, is now well into a second career as a singer. On Sunday afternoon he headlined a Central Park SummerStage concert supported by the French Embassy to coincide with the Fête de la Musique, a nationwide day of free concerts in France. Among the athletic elite with pop ambitions, Mr. Noah, 49, is more convincing than, say, Shaquille O’Neal as a rapper.

Mr. Noah doesn’t write his own songs, but he chooses benign ones like “Donne-Moi une Vie,” from his most recent album, the 2006 “Charango” (St. George/Sony BMG France), which insists that from Calcutta to Haiti to the Gaza Strip children deserve a life with hope, and “Yé Mama Yé,” offering gratitude to his grandmother. His slim but agreeable voice is polished in the studio, and onstage he wisely relied on his band’s grooves: reggae, funk, rock, hints of Andean music as well as upbeat bikutsi and makossa from Cameroon, where his father was born.

He swiveled his hips to the African rhythms, shook his dreadlocks, made his way through the audience and borrowed liberally from a surefire source: Bob Marley, whose “Woy-yo-yo” singalongs punctuated more than one song and who wrote one of the encores, “Redemption Song.” Taking on that mantle would be presumptuous. What Mr. Noah is after, instead, is a good time with a clear conscience.

The triple bill also included the United States debut of Coralie Clément, an updated French pop chanteuse. She has a small, breathy voice and songs that touch on chanson, cabaret, bossa nova and flamenco; backing her were a guitarist and a keyboardist who played the theremin and carried her rhythm section on a laptop. It wasn’t her day.

Between rain and technical problems her music longed for someplace more intimate and indoors, where she could whisper.

The concert’s most gifted musician was the opener: Mayra Andrade, a singer who identifies herself as Cape Verdean. She was born in Cuba to parents from Cape Verde, and has lived in Cape Verde, Senegal, Angola, Germany and now France. With a limber, inviting voice, Ms. Andrade fuses Cape Verdean styles — the gentle morna and the peppier coladeira and funana — with Brazilian music, jazz and hints of African styles.
761 2009-06-23 Vulnerability, and a certain fatalism about it, are part of the fabric of life in this archipelago, 2,500 miles from the mainland and, as many residents seem to have memorized since the Obama administration raised the alarm last week, 4,500 miles from North Korea.

People took comfort in the heavy, year-round military presence provided by several bases here but also wondered if it made the state more of a target.

In an interview Monday on ’s “Early Show,” , who was born and spent much of his youth here, said, “Our military is fully prepared for any contingencies” regarding North Korea.

Defense Secretary announced Thursday that the military had deployed ground-based interceptors and sea-based radar to help deflect any long-range missile from North Korea. Calls to Gov. , a Republican, were referred to Maj. Gen. Robert G. F. Lee, the director of the State Department of Defense, who suggested that the threat was more saber-rattling from North Korea. He questioned whether its missiles had the technological capacity to go very far, but just the same, he said, the state was ready for hostile action.

“Our military assets should be able to protect us,” said General Lee, whose duties include civil defense. “We, like all states, are prepared for natural disasters down to terrorism.”

He said the state’s disaster sirens were working, and residents, as always, were advised to keep a three-day supply of food, water, medicine and other essentials in stock.

“Out here by ourselves, we have to be a little more prepared, just in case help does not get here quickly from the mainland,” he said.

Of course, the specter of Pearl Harbor still figures prominently here, as well as the cat-and-mouse of cold war maneuverings off the coast, including the mysterious loss of a Soviet ballistic-missile submarine 750 miles northwest of in 1968.

“We are first strike from ,” said State Representative Joseph M. Souki, 76, a Democrat, who still remembers the wave of that swept his neighborhood on as Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941. “It’s not like we are in .”

Still, he said, “more than likely nothing is going to happen.”

“Hawaii is like a pawn in a chess game,” he added.

The state can ill afford anything approximating a calamity.

The has been blamed for a nearly 11 percent drop in the number of visitors here last year compared with the year before. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in May reached 7.4 percent, up from 6.9 percent in April and the highest in three decades.

The tourists that did come carried on as usual, taking lessons, strolling Waikiki Beach and reflecting at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, where a park includes a display of old Polaris submarine-launched missiles.

“Send one of these babies up,” Clifton Wannaker, 45, an accountant from , said when told of the North Korean threat. He knocked on the missile’s skin for good measure.

Standing at the shoreline in view of the memorial, Steve Brecheen, 54, a pharmacist from , seemed a bit more unnerved.

“North Korea seems the most unstable government as far as a threat to the U.S. is concerned,” Mr. Brecheen said.

He motioned to the memorial, which sits over the remains of the battleship sunk by the Japanese in the Pearl Harbor attack.

“In 1941, some of these people didn’t think the Japanese were an extreme threat, and they got their minds changed pretty quickly,” he said.

But among Hawaiians, skepticism is mixed with annoyance and even anger that their state, hypothetically at least, could be a testing ground.

“I think they would be stupid to do that test,” said Misioka Tauiliili, 39, a delivery truck driver, taking in the placid scene at a city beach near Waikiki. “The U.S. should go out there and shake them.”

By that he meant the United States perhaps firing its own rockets in North Korea’s direction, “to test them.”

Mark N. Brown, 49, an artist painting nearby, was less bellicose. He said he took comfort in the steps the military had taken and remained concerned that an act of aggression by North Korea would lead to war.

But, with a wry smile, he added that a neighboring island, far less populated but a bit closer to North Korea, would probably take the hit.

“It would hit ,” he said. “We are on Oahu.”

Mele Connor, 55, a lifelong Hawaiian shopping with visitors from the mainland at a clothing store in Waikiki, laughed off the threat.

“After North Korea, it will be somebody else,” she said. “They know Obama is from here, so they want something. Everybody wants something from our pretty little islands.”
762 2009-06-23 LONDON (Reuters) — Virgin Atlantic plans to take delivery of 10 Airbus A330-300 aircraft by 2012, allowing the airline to expand while awaiting delivery of Boeing’s long-delayed 787 Dreamliner.

The 25-year-old airline, controlled by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, told Reuters ahead of an official announcement at Heathrow Airport that the aircraft were worth $2.1 billion.

“This will help us with future growth, taking us to new destinations such as Beijing and Vancouver,” Mr. Branson told a news conference on Monday. “We have had some good years and have accumulated some cash.”

A Dutch plane-leasing company, AerCap Holdings, said in a statement that it would purchase and lease back six of the aircraft that Virgin has ordered and would lease the remaining four directly to the airline.

Five of the wide-body aircraft will be delivered in 2011, the other five in 2012, Virgin Atlantic said. Airbus is a unit of the plane maker European Aeronautic Defense and Space.
763 2009-06-23 He then walked down a twisting back stairwell that led to a side kitchen exit. Mickelson made his way to the 18th green and the trophy presentation, where he received a silver medal along with his fellow second-place finishers, and Ricky Barnes. Mickelson stood in the sun and gazed around the vast grandstand, which erupted in applause at the mention of his name.

Later, in a news conference, Mickelson was asked if he had allowed himself to dream about what it would have been like to win in his return to Bethpage Black and in the last tournament he would play before his wife, Amy, begins treatment.

Mickelson said that even when he eagled the th hole and vaulted into a tie for the lead, he tried not to think ahead. But standing on the green during the trophy presentation, his head turning side to side as he took in the scene, it was easy to imagine that Mickelson knew in that moment that the ceremony and the celebration could have been for him. Only louder.

Walking toward the 17th green an hour earlier, when the tournament was still up for grabs, a voice had risen above the applause.

“Don’t give up, Phil,” the fan yelled. “We won’t quit on you. Don’t quit on us.”

Mickelson, who had lost his share of the lead minutes earlier with three putts on the 15th green, smiled and gave the fan a thumbs-up.

But on the 17th green, an uneasy tension enveloped the bowl-like setting as Mickelson stood over a routine 3-foot par putt. The disquiet was prescient. Mickelson’s stroke was nervous and soft. When the putt never touched the hole, there was a wounded groan from the grandstand.

At the final green, by the time Mickelson missed a difficult 20-foot putt for birdie, the crowd and Mickelson seemed to have conceded the outcome. He doffed his cap; the fans rose and gave a standing ovation.

After maybe 30 minutes in and out of the clubhouse, Mickelson addressed reporters under a tree. He paused more than a few times as he spoke.

“I want to win this tournament badly,” he said. “I am second again. I have been second five times. But I don’t know where to go with this because, you know, this time I feel different. I’ve got more important things going on. And, oh, well.”

He talked about his wife briefly, making mention of a short vacation and the start of her treatment. “I think once we get going in about 10 days, it might be a little easier,” he said. “The wait has been difficult.”

His bags already in a silver Volvo, Mickelson started to work his way away from the clubhouse. About a hundred fans were calling to him from beyond a temporary railing. Though it was slightly out of his way, Mickelson walked toward them and began signing his name on tickets, hats, souvenir flags and anything else the surging crowd thrust toward him.

He answered questions, thanked fans, made jokes and smiled for pictures. He did this for 20 minutes until he began to drift in the direction of his car.

New York state troopers were making a path, but the fans just kept running ahead of the police corridor and Mickelson kept pausing to sign his autograph some more. Finally, Mickelson was past a gate and walking toward the very few cars in the players’ parking lot.

“Give our love to Amy,” a woman shouted to him.

“I will,” Mickelson answered, raising his voice so he could be heard.

He signed autographs for the state troopers, then shook each of their hands. Opening the car door, he sunk into the front passenger seat.

Mickelson took off his hat, wiped his right hand across his forehead and rubbed his eyes with his thumb and index finger. The car backed up and pulled away as fans straining behind a barricade waved in his direction and called his name.
764 2009-06-23 “The market’s gone too far, too fast,” said Karl O. Mills, president of the investment adviser firm Jurika, Mills & Keifer. “It’s writing checks that the recovery can’t cash.” On Monday, some of those checks bounced.

“Basically it’s a reality check,” Gerhard Schwarz, an equity strategist at Unicredit in Munich, said. Optimistic investors have bid stocks up by more than 30 percent from their nadir, he said, but “there’s been a lack of confirmation that it is justified. We’re waiting for hard economic data to show the economy has turned around.”

Financial stocks fell significantly as investors apparently saw little difference between big banks and small ones, as well as banks that had returned government bailout funds and those that were still holding onto taxpayer money. Shares of Bank of America fell 9.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase fell 6.1 percent and Morgan Stanley was off 5.8 percent.

Shares of Apple were down 1.5 percent, to $137.37, after reports over the weekend that its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, who has been on a medical leave since January for treatment of what he called a hormone imbalance, underwent a liver transplant two months ago.

Apple shares fell despite the company announcing that it had sold more than a million units of its latest iPhone model in the first three days.

The prices of commodities like crude oil, copper and gold slumped as investors faced the prospect that emerging markets and developed economies were not about to ramp up industrial production or witness a spike in levels of consumer demand and consumption.

Crude oil futures fell $2.62, settling at $66.93 a barrel, their lowest levels in three weeks, even as discord and protests in Iran raised questions about the stability of one of the Middle East’s largest oil producers. Gasoline prices in the United States held steady at a nationwide average of $2.69 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club.

The declines in commodities pulled down energy producers like BP in London, Total in Paris and Marathon Oil and Chevron in New York. The declines also weakened companies that produce basic materials like chemicals and steel.

Analysts said that investors were taking a more cautious approach ahead of companies’ reports of second-quarter earnings and a meeting of the Federal Reserve this week. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates at their record low levels near zero percent, but investors will pay attention to the central bank’s statements about inflation and the success of its monetary policies.

“You’re seeing people lock profits in, if there are any left,” said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management.

Stocks shot higher this spring after dipping to their worst levels in more than a decade, but many Wall Street analysts say investors who have dived back into the markets are ignoring fundamental problems in the economy. The S.& P. 500 is down 5 percent since earlier this month, and many analysts say the stock markets could get stuck in a broad trading range as investors look ahead toward a sluggish recovery.

Unemployment is rising and is expected to reach 10 percent or more, even after the broader economy begins to recover. Hundreds of big and small banks across the country are still on government lifelines. And while credit markets are returning to normal after last year’s financial crisis, analysts say higher interest rates on Treasury notes and mortgages threaten to disrupt the government’s attempts to right the economy.

Investors are paying close attention to the bond market this week as the Treasury Department prepares to auction a record $104 billion in government notes.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.68 percent from 3.78 percent on Friday, indicating higher demand for safe-haven government debt. The price, which moves in the opposite direction of yield, rose 25/32 to 95 13/32.

Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

791 2009-06-24 HONG KONG — After six months in detention, one of China’s best-known dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, has been formally arrested and charged with subversion, the state news media said Wednesday.

Mr. Liu was detained in December after signing Charter 08, which calls for democracy in China.

Citing the Beijing police, the official Xinhua news agency said Mr. Liu, 53, had been arrested for alleged “agitation activities, such as spreading of rumors and defaming of the government, aimed at subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialism system.” Human rights activists are commonly accused of seeking to subvert the state, but it is unusual for the government to include an allegation that someone is seeking to overthrow the Socialist system.

Xinhua said Mr. Liu had confessed during a preliminary police investigation; prisoners in detention have few legal rights and are subject to pressure.

793 2009-06-24 A Senate investigative committee has concluded that excessive speculation by commodity index investors has inflated the price of wheat and distorted trading in the wheat futures markets.

In a report to be released on Wednesday, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will recommend that regulators sharply limit the amount of futures trading by index investors. The report offers what its authors called “significant and persuasive evidence” that these index investors were “one of the major causes” of higher wheat prices and episodic gaps that occurred between futures market prices and prices in the cash market for wheat.

“The resulting unusual, persistent and large disparities between wheat futures and cash prices impaired the ability of participants in the grain markets to use the futures market to price their crops and hedge their price risks over time,” the report concluded.

Research by the panel showed a sharp increase in the role of index investors in the wheat futures market, beginning in early 2006. Since then, the disparities between the cash and futures prices have grown larger and more frequent, according to the report.

Index funds operate in the futures markets under waivers from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which ruled that they were legitimately hedging their financial exposure to the commodity index products they sell to investors.

The report recommends that the commission revoke those waivers and subject index traders to the limits imposed on other speculators.
794 2009-06-24 The Y.M.C.A. has the most valuable brand in the nonprofit field, according to an analysis by two marketing companies.

The second-most-valuable brand belongs to the Salvation Army, followed by the United Way of America.

The analysis, by the marketing firm Cone LLC and Intangible Business, a British brand-valuation company, used financial data, projected growth in revenues and a survey of 1,000 Americans to determine the top 100 most valuable nonprofit brand names among organizations providing social, environmental and animal-related services.

“We hope to show what a powerful asset a brand can be to a nonprofit, if it is leveraged properly,” said Alison DaSilva, executive vice president of Cone.

Nonprofits like the United Way and the American Red Cross, whose name was the fourth most valuable on Cone’s list, have made efforts to value their brand names in the past, but the new analysis appears to be the first that applies the same method of measuring that value across many different nonprofits.

The list is likely to interest companies as well as nonprofits and donors, Ms. DaSilva said. Businesses support nonprofits as a way of enhancing their own brands, and nonprofits with the best brand names will have a greater halo effect.

The analysis spotted some interesting things. Environmental groups are the darlings of donors right now and their revenues are among the fastest growing in the sector — but their brand names scored lower values in the Cone research.

“They have spent a lot of time raising awareness of the issues through things like calls to action — put a brick in your toilet, turn out the lights — but not for their brands,” Ms. DaSilva said.
795 2009-06-24 This raises a few questions. An academic might talk of the intersection between public and private space. A straphanger may ask how all those names can fit into one announcement.

And if a company can pay to get its name on any station, a New Yorker might wonder what’s next: Presents 59th Street-Columbus Circle?

The answer is maybe. Once upon a time, geographic relevance determined a station’s name, but now, the authority says it is open to any naming agreements that can raise revenue for its transit system, including ones not directly tied to location.

“It’s always a question of balancing our need for revenue and our stewardship of public space,” said Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the agency. Advertising may make the most sense for a company associated with a station, he said, “but we’re not closing anything out.”

And the Barclays deal has defenders on the authority’s governing board.

“It’s not like Taco Bell saying it wants Grand Army Plaza or something like that,” said John H. Banks III, a board member since 2004.

“A year and a half ago? Yeah,” he said. “Tomorrow? No.”

Still, while selling station names could bring the authority revenue it needs, advertising experts say companies may not be as well-served.

“To be effective, the viewer needs to understand the relevance of the ad,” said Allen Adamson of Landor, a branding firm. “To rename the 59th and Lex stop the stop — it ain’t going to work. I don’t think it will stick.”

Indeed, other cities have tried this with little success. , for example, tried auctioning off four historic stations a few years ago and received no bids. Though paid $400 million to sponsor the new Mets stadium in , the company refused to pay the authority to rename the stop nearby, which is now known as Mets/Willets Point.

To determine its asking price for the Brooklyn station, the authority studied a few successful efforts, like a monorail in named for Nextel, the communications company, and streetcars in , Fla., named for a local electric utility. And the popularity of the station — the second-busiest in Brooklyn last year — was taken into account.

“It’s grounded in reasonable business practices,” Mr. Banks said. “Obviously Van Siclen on a No. 2 is not going to be as valuable to a corporate entity as Atlantic Avenue.”

The station name change is scheduled for the opening of the arena, timed for 2012. The exact punctuation of the new station name has yet to be determined, the authority said, although hyphens or slashes are likely to be used. New signage would be paid for by Forest City Ratner, and the authority plans to introduce the revised name gradually in maps and timetables after the arena opens.

A few New York businesses contacted on Tuesday said they were not interested in a piece of the underground. Zabar’s, the Upper West Side food emporium, said it was not interested in the 79th Street station. said a sponsorship deal at 34th Street was not in the cards.

And straphangers at the Atlantic Avenue station like Nick Desio, 53, a Citigroup employee who commutes from , said names were beside the point.

“They can call it anything they want, as long as my train’s on time,” he said.
796 2009-06-24 Chrysler largely emerged from bankruptcy in just 42 days. General Motors appears poised to lift the bulk of its desirable assets from Chapter 11 protection in even less time than that.

But nearly four years after it first entered bankruptcy, Delphi, the big auto parts supplier, remains locked in contentious negotiations over its latest plan for escaping Chapter 11.

It is now trying to sell many of its assets to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm. As a July 23 hearing to approve the sale draws closer, the war of words between some of the company’s lenders and Delphi and Platinum is growing more heated.

Delphi’s lenders, including hedge funds that provided bankruptcy financing, have accused the company of striking what they call a sweetheart deal with Platinum. Many of these firms have also complained that they will get only 20 cents on the dollar for the $2.55 billion in debtor-in-possession loans they gave Delphi, financing that is normally paid off in full and in cash. (Holders of other parts of the complicated loan will be paid off in full.)

According to the terms of the Platinum deal, which was announced June 1, the private equity firm will provide $250 million in cash and a $250 million credit line to acquire the bulk of the company. G.M., a onetime owner of Delphi and still a big customer, is taking back four plants and its steering business. G.M. will also provide the rest of the $3.6 billion exit financing package.
797 2009-06-24 Secretary Duncan plans to create an easy process for families to click on their online application to automatically fill in the financial data they have already filed with the Internal Revenue Service as part of their tax returns.

That process, which has long been under discussion, had been expected to take several years. But in recent months, when Education Department officials discussed it with I.R.S. officials, it seemed to be something that could be started in January, for students going into the spring or summer college semester.

Those applying for aid to start college next fall will not be able to have the I.R.S. import their information, because the tax returns that determine their eligibility will not be filed in time.

While the Education Department can proceed with some of the changes, Congressional approval will be required for Mr. Duncan’s plan to eliminate more than half of the form’s financial questions, which often seek data not on the federal tax form.

The department said most of the questions to be eliminated, like one regarding untaxed income earned by members of the clergy, would affect few applications.

Indeed, officials say, the six questions about assets affect aid to only 3 percent of Pell grant recipients, while penalizing families saving for college and opening loopholes for sophisticated applicants to game the system.

Margaret Spellings, the secretary of education in the Bush administration, had proposed bigger changes, seeking to eliminate all financial data except adjusted gross income and the number of tax exemptions. Department officials say the Obama administration’s more moderate proposal may be more palatable to Congress.

“Confusing paperwork shouldn’t stand between qualified students and a college degree,” said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. “Secretary Duncan has put forth common-sense proposals for streamlining the Fafsa.”

The Higher Education Opportunity Act, passed in the last Congress, made some progress toward simplifying the Fafsa form, by, among other things, creating a two-page EZ form for some low-income families, and streamlining the reapplication process.

But some critics argue that the proposed simplification does not go far enough. “The whole form should be able to fit on the back of a postcard,” said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid, an online guide to student aid. “And they need to simplify not just the form but the formula for determining aid.”

Others, meanwhile, argue that the form does not get enough information to measure financial worth adequately because it excludes assets like cars, homes and some family businesses and does not factor in the high cost of living in areas like New York.
798 2009-06-24 Health authorities are scrambling to come up with enough vaccine to protect the world’s population against the recently declared pandemic of swine flu, which has killed more than 230 people worldwide and sickened more than 52,000. They are worried that the death toll from the strain might rise sharply this winter.

“I can’t imagine what legitimate purpose can be served by trying to close the company,” Daniel D. Adams, the chief executive of Protein Sciences, said in an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Adams said that Emergent’s suit was without merit and that its actions were making it difficult for Protein Sciences to attract new investors.

But Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi, president and chief operating officer of Emergent, said that bankruptcy “doesn’t destroy the product, and it doesn’t destroy the technology.” It might result in the technology’s being sold to a stronger company, like his own or others, he said. Emergent, which makes the anthrax vaccine used by the armed forces, says it has been more than patient in giving Protein Sciences a chance to pay back the loan.

Protein Sciences is one of several small companies trying to make influenza vaccines by methods that are faster than growing them in chicken eggs, the technique now generally used.

Instead of growing whole viruses, Protein Sciences produces just a protein from the virus and it does so in genetically modified insect cells.

The company, which is privately held, has already applied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of a seasonal flu vaccine. And last week, Mr. Adams said, the company made its first 100,000 doses of a vaccine against the new swine flu.

The federal contract will help Protein Sciences develop its technology and obtain F.D.A. approval. It can be extended up to five years for a total cost of $147 million.

If the technology is proved safe and effective and is licensed by the F.D.A, the contract calls for Protein Sciences to establish domestic manufacturing capacity, to provide a finished vaccine within 12 weeks of the onset of a pandemic and to produce at least 50 million doses of a pandemic flu vaccine within six months.

Mr. Robinson of Health and Human Services said that for the current pandemic, the Protein Sciences vaccine might be used as a backup to those being supplied by larger companies.

801 2009-06-24 “Not newly graduated civil engineers,” said Larry Jacobson, executive director of the National Society of Professional Engineers. “What’s missing are enough licensed professionals who have worked at least five years under experienced engineers before taking the licensing exam.”

While these workers might be lured away by higher offers in a robust economy, they should be more plentiful when overall business demand is as slack as it is now.

For these hard-to-fill jobs, there seems to be a common denominator. Employers are looking for people who have acquired an exacting skill, first through education — often just high school vocational training — and then by honing it on the job. That trajectory, requiring years, is no longer so easy in America, said Richard Sennett, a sociologist.

The pressure to earn a bachelor’s degree draws young people away from occupational training, particularly occupations that do not require college, Mr. Sennett said, and he cited two other factors. Outsourcing interrupts employment before a skill is fully developed, and layoffs undermine dedication to a single occupation. “People are told they can’t get back to work unless they retrain for a new skill,” he said.

None of this deterred Keelan Prados from pursuing a career as a welder, one among roughly 200,000 across the nation. At 28, he has more than a decade of experience, beginning when he was a teenager, building and repairing oil field equipment in his father’s shop in . Marriage to a Canadian brought the Pradoses to , near her family. And before Mr. Prados joined Cianbro, an industrial contractor, he ran his own business, repairing logging equipment out of a welding and machine shop on the grounds of his home in Brewer.

The recession dried up that work, and last December, he answered one of Mr. McGrary’s ads. “I welded a couple of pieces of plate together for them and two pipes, and they were impressed,” Mr. Prados said. In less than two weeks, he was at work on Cianbro’s oil refinery project, earning $22 an hour and among the youngest of Mr. McGrary’s hires, most of whom are in their mid-30s to early 40s.

The does not track how often Mr. Prados’s experience — applying for a job and quickly being offered it — is repeated in America in the midst of huge and protracted unemployment. A bureau survey counts the number of job openings and the number of hires, but the data is not broken down by occupation.

, a business organization in New York, comes closer. In a monthly count of online job openings — listed on Monster.com and more than 1,200 similar Web sites — it breaks the advertised openings into 22 broad occupational categories and compares those with the number of unemployed whose last job, according to the bureau, was in each category. In only four of the categories — and engineering, the physical sciences, computer and mathematical science, and health care — were the unemployed equal to or fewer than the listed job openings. There were, in sum, 1.09 million listed openings and only 582,700 unemployed people presumably available to fill them.

The Conference Board’s hard-to-fill openings include , but the shortage is not as great as it was before the recession, particularly in battered states like and , said Cheryl Peterson, a director of the American Nurses Association.

“Until the downturn, it was easy for experienced registered nurses to find employment right in their communities, in whatever positions they wanted,” Ms. Peterson said. “Now it is a little more difficult because the number of job openings has fallen and we have more retired nurses, in need of income, coming back.”

That does not hold for nurses who have a decade of experience caring for critically ill people, particularly in hospital recovery rooms, said Dr. Robert Pearl, chief executive and chairman of the Permanente Medical Group, a big employer of medical professionals. “There are probably more nurses recently trained than there are jobs for them,” he said, “but for those with the highest level of skill and experience, there are always openings.” And at $100,000 in pay.

That is also the case for geological engineers like Diane Oshlo, who was hired last month by Kleinfelder, a professional services firm headquartered in that takes on big projects, like the environmental cleanup work Ms. Oshlo is doing in , Tex., at the site of an inactive oil refinery. Engineers like her, skilled in petroleum, are in short supply, and those who are also professional geologists are even rarer.

That made Ms. Oshlo, 50, a hot prospect when she decided to relocate from , where she had lived for years, doing similar work for a similar firm. Margaret Duner, a Kleinfelder recruiter, spotted her résumé when it arrived in the spring in response to a job ad, and quickly brought her into the hiring process. “Diane stood out,” Ms. Duner said.

Two other firms to which Ms. Oshlo sent résumés also quickly offered work. What swayed her was not the $65,000 salary — there will be raises and bonuses soon, Ms. Duner said — but Kleinfelder’s willingness to pay to move her to Corpus Christi.

“I told the two others I couldn’t wait,” Ms. Oshlo said. “They offered roughly the same pay, but they weren’t sure about the relocation package.”
802 2009-06-24 When I spoke to the South Carolina Legislature, I noticed a couple of very attractive women, both of them Republicans, in the Legislature. ... I don’t want to go through with a Lenore Romney thing, but I want you to be sure to emphasize to our people: God, let’s look for some. Understand, I don’t do it because I’m for women; I do it because I think maybe a woman might win someplace where a man might not.

— Nixon in a Feb. 23, 1971, phone conversation with future President George Bush, who was then the chairman of the Republican National Committee. (Lenore Romney, the wife of former Gov. George Romney and mother of future Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1970.)

Anti-Semitism is stronger than we think. You know, it’s unfortunate. But this has happened to the Jews. It happened in Spain, it happened in Germany, it’s happening — and now it’s going to happen in America if these people don’t start behaving. ... It may be they have a death wish. You know that’s been the problem with our Jewish friends for centuries.

Your job is to see that, by God, we put it to ’em. I mean, assuming it works out. It’s going to work out one way or the other. If Thieu doesn’t go, that’s going to — that isn’t too bad either. We go ahead and make our deal and we sink Thieu and everybody says, ‘Thank God he was a tough son of a bitch,’ on both sides. The hell with him. ... Get the prisoners back, a cease-fire, and ... peace with honor when they would have got the bug out. Then we just pour it right to them.

— Nixon in a Jan. 20, 1973, phone conversation with a White House aide, Charles W. Colson. Nixon was drawing criticism for an intensified bombing campaign of North Vietnam as the Paris peace talks were reaching a climax and the president of South Vietnam, Nguyen Van Thieu, was resisting the cease-fire agreement terms.
803 2009-06-24 Internal Treasury Department documents obtained by the lawyers under the Freedom of Information Act, for instance, said that a prominent Saudi charity, the International Islamic Relief Organization, heavily supported by members of the Saudi royal family, showed “support for terrorist organizations” at least through 2006.

A self-described Qaeda operative in Bosnia said in an interview with lawyers in the lawsuit that another charity largely controlled by members of the royal family, the Saudi High Commission for Aid to Bosnia, provided money and supplies to the terrorist group in the 1990s and hired militant operatives like himself.

Another witness in Afghanistan said in a sworn statement that in 1998 he had witnessed an emissary for a leading Saudi prince, Turki al-Faisal, hand a check for one billion Saudi riyals (now worth about $267 million) to a top Taliban leader.

And a confidential German intelligence report gave a line-by-line description of tens of millions of dollars in bank transfers, with dates and dollar amounts, made in the early 1990s by Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz and other members of the Saudi royal family to another charity that was suspected of financing militants’ activities in Pakistan and Bosnia.

The new documents, provided to The New York Times by the lawyers, are among several hundred thousand pages of investigative material obtained by the Sept. 11 families and their insurers as part of a long-running civil lawsuit seeking to hold Saudi Arabia and its royal family liable for financing Al Qaeda.

Only a fraction of the documents have been entered into the court record, and much of the new material is unknown even to the Saudi lawyers in the case.

The documents provide no smoking gun connecting the royal family to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. And the broader links rely at times on a circumstantial, connect-the-dots approach to tie together Saudi princes, Middle Eastern charities, suspicious transactions and terrorist groups.

Saudi lawyers and supporters say that the links are flimsy and exploit stereotypes about terrorism, and that the country is being sued because it has deep pockets and was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers.

“In looking at all the evidence the families brought together, I have not seen one iota of evidence that Saudi Arabia had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks,” Michael Kellogg, a Washington lawyer representing Prince Muhammad al-Faisal al-Saud in the lawsuit, said in an interview.

He and other defense lawyers said that rather than supporting Al Qaeda, the Saudis were sworn enemies of its leader, Osama bin Laden, who was exiled from Saudi Arabia, his native country, in 1996. “It’s an absolute tragedy what happened to them, and I understand their anger,” Mr. Kellogg said of the victims’ families. “They want to find those responsible, but I think they’ve been disserved by their lawyers by bringing claims without any merit against the wrong people.”

The Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment.

Two federal judges and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals have already ruled against the 7,630 people represented in the lawsuit, made up of survivors of the attacks and family members of those killed, throwing out the suit on the ground that the families cannot bring legal action in the United States against a sovereign nation and its leaders.

The Supreme Court is expected to decide this week whether to hear an appeal, but the families’ prospects dimmed last month when the Justice Department sided with the Saudis in their immunity claim and urged the court not to consider the appeal.

The Justice Department said a 1976 law on sovereign immunity protected the Saudis from liability and noted that “potentially significant foreign relations consequences” would arise if such suits were allowed to proceed.

“Cases like this put the U.S. government in an extremely difficult position when it has to make legal arguments, even when they are the better view of the law, that run counter to those of terrorist victims,” said John Bellinger, a former State Department lawyer who was involved in the Saudi litigation.

Senior Obama administration officials held a private meeting on Monday with 9/11 family members to speak about progress in cracking down on terrorist financing. Administration officials at the meeting largely sidestepped questions about the lawsuit, according to participants. But the official who helped lead the meeting, Stuart A. Levey, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, has been outspoken in his criticism of wealthy Saudis, saying they have helped to finance terrorism.

Even if the 9/11 families were to get their trial in the lawsuit, they might have difficulty getting some of their new material into evidence. Some would most likely be challenged on grounds it was irrelevant or uncorroborated hearsay, or that it related to Saudis who were clearly covered by sovereign immunity.

And if the families were to clear those hurdles, two intriguing pieces of evidence in the Saudi puzzle might still remain off limits.

One is a 28-page, classified section of the 2003 joint Congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks. The secret section is believed to discuss intelligence on Saudi financial links to two hijackers, and the Saudis themselves urged at the time that it be made public. President George W. Bush declined to do so.

Kristen Breitweiser, an advocate for Sept. 11 families, whose husband was killed in the World Trade Center, said in an interview that during a White House meeting in February between President Obama and victims’ families, the president told her that he was willing to make the pages public.

But she said she had not heard from the White House since then.

The other evidence that may not be admissible consists of classified documents leaked to one of the law firms representing the families, Motley Rice of South Carolina, which is headed by Ronald Motley, a well-known trial lawyer who won lucrative lawsuits involving asbestos and tobacco.

Lawyers for the firm say someone anonymously slipped them 55 documents that contained classified government material relating to the Saudi lawsuit.

Though she declined to describe the records, Jodi Flowers, a lawyer for Motley Rice, said she was pushing to have them placed in the court file.

“We wouldn’t be fighting this hard, and we wouldn’t have turned the material over to the judge, if we didn’t think it was really important to the case,” she said.
804 2009-06-24 LONDON — The summer auction season got off to a tepid start at Christie’s on Tuesday night, when only a few paintings drew buyers’ attention, including a Monet that sold for $10.2 million, one of the few high points of the evening.

It was a thin sale, with a mixed bag of Impressionist and modern art, nearly half the number of works of last year’s auction and no blockbusters. The evening reflected the state of the economy: with prices for art having fallen significantly since autumn, Christie’s experts had trouble cobbling together a sale because collectors refused to part with their paintings, drawings or sculptures unless they absolutely had to. Buyers — primarily Europeans — were cautious about spending money, and bidding was thin.

The combination of meager offerings and tight purse strings led Christie’s to reduce some reserve prices — a handful of works sold for less than their estimates — and made for a dull night. “When good things come up for sale, they make good money,” said Edward Dolman, chief executive of Christie’s, “but much less is coming to the market.”

Playing off the hit Gagosian exhibition of late Picassos that closed in New York last month, the evening’s star work was Picasso’s “Man With a Sword,” dated July 26, 1969. It was being sold by the Saudi Arabian Juffali family. One member bought it from the auction house here four years ago for $5 million. Experts predicted it would sell for $7.5 million to $10.6 million. Only two bidders were interested, and the work went for $9.3 million — in the middle of the estimate — to the Nahmad family, dealers with galleries in New York and London.
805 2009-06-24 HOUSTON — The Antiguan government fired its top banking regulator on Tuesday after the United States government asked that he be detained for extradition on charges of helping the Texas billionaire R. Allen Stanford cover up a $7 billion fraud.

The regulator, Leroy King, was indicted last week with Mr. Stanford and other executives and accused of defrauding 30,000 people who had invested in certificates of deposit at Stanford International Bank, based in Antigua. Mr. King was suspended as head of the Antigua and Barbuda Financial Services Regulatory Commission last week.

The Justice Department accused Mr. Stanford of paying Mr. King thousands of dollars a month to conduct fake audits and file inaccurate reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which began investigating the bank in 2005.

Mr. King will not be detained until Antiguan judicial authorities consider the request, the government said. Attorney General Justin L. Simon has said an extradition process could be lengthy. Mr. Simon said that based on an initial investigation of Mr. King, “it appears so far he was not working with anyone.” The commission board could not find copies of various fraudulent reports Mr. King made to the S.E.C. in commission files, suggesting that he alone had written and seen them, Mr. Simon said.

But he added, “The matter is not yet over.”

Mr. Stanford was expected to be transported Tuesday to Houston by federal marshals for a detention hearing in federal court later in the week. His lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, has said he will plead not guilty.

Mr. King was forced to take a leave of absence from the regulatory commission in March, shortly after the S.E.C. closed down Mr. Stanford’s operations and filed a civil suit against him.

In a statement, the commission’s board said it had been investigating Mr. King for several weeks and gave him a “final opportunity to provide an explanation for his questionable conduct” in an interview on June 18. It said it suspended him based on its findings that Mr. King had “deliberately or negligently failed to inform the board of various questionable decisions he had taken.”
806 2009-06-24 A repeat of CBS’s “Two and a Half Men” delivered Monday night’s highest ratings, drawing 8.6 million viewers at 9 p.m., according to Nielsen’s estimates. CBS led the night over all, with a lineup of all repeats, including “The Big Bang Theory” (7.2 million) and “CSI: Miami” (7.9 million). ABC finished close behind in second place, with new episodes of its reality shows “The Bachelorette” (6.8 million) and “Here Come the Newlyweds” (4.1 million). NBC ranked third with two hours of “I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!” (4.3 million) followed by “Dateline” (5.1 million), while Fox finished in fourth with reruns of “House” (4.9 million) and “Lie to Me” (3.8 million).
807 2009-06-24 There’s no shame  not much, anyway  in admitting that you like a writer’s left-handed productions (John Updike called them odd jobs) as much as his or her big books. Martin Amis, David Foster Wallace and Mr. Updike are best known for their novels, but more than a few people would as happily pack their essays, journalism and book reviews for a month on a desert island.

Graham Swift, the British novelist, understands this concept. His new book, “Making an Elephant: Writing From Within,” is his first stab at a nonfiction miscellany, and in it he writes that he prefers Raymond Carver’s poetry to his more celebrated short stories. He also speaks more vividly about a Ted Hughes fly-fishing essay than any of his poems. When it comes to reading material, the heart wants what the heart wants.

Mr. Swift is the author of such sly, sophisticated novels as “Waterland” (1983) and “Last Orders,” which won the Booker Prize in 1996. Somewhat less sly and sophisticated, “Making an Elephant” is a grab-bag assortment of speeches, occasional essays, interviews, poetry and stray recollections.

Part of what you’re looking for, in a book like this one, is a freckling of high-minded literary gossip. Mr. Swift appears to be offering more than most. Among the essays here are accounts of buying a guitar with Kazuo Ishiguro, of fly-fishing in Devon with Hughes and of spending a few Christmases with Salman Rushdie in the years just after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against him.

The Rushdie essay has its moments. He shows up at Mr. Swift’s house with his bodyguards, after it’s been decided that everyone should have, for security purposes, “Reservoir Dogs”-style nicknames. Thus Mr. Rushdie is Mr. Brown, Mr. Swift is Mr. White and the novelist Caryl Phillips is Mr. Black.

Mr. Rushdie counsels Mr. Swift on how best to conquer fear. “He said that the thing was that you had to quell it,” Mr. Swift writes, “crush it at once, as soon as it arose, give it no further space, otherwise you were lost.”

And Mr. Swift notes, “Once you’ve played charades with the author of ‘The Satanic Verses’ or heard his imitation (not quite as good, in my opinion, as Kazuo Ishiguro’s) of Bob Dylan, your view of things is fundamentally improved.”

This Rushdie essay ultimately leaves a tinny taste in your mouth, however, and not just because the last clause in the sentence above (“your view of things is fundamentally improved”) is essentially meaningless.

Perhaps that tinny taste derives from the fact that Mr. Swift admits about Mr. Rushdie, “we don’t see each other now.” Well, what happened? Or perhaps it’s because the essay is stuffed, in a way that Mr. Swift’s novels are not, with lazy observations  observations, that is, that are hardly observations at all. Mr. Rushdie, we read, was “capable of feeling and being a kid again” and “was good, affectionate company.”

Mr. Swift paints with similarly broad strokes about Hughes. “I quickly learned,” he writes, “what good, easy, gentle company he was.” It turns out he and Hughes remained mere acquaintances. “I can’t pretend,” he writes, “to have known him well or closely.”

You begin an essay called “Negronis With Alan”  great title!  about Mr. Swift’s first editor, Alan Ross, and you think: well, here it comes, finally we’ll get a closely observed portrait of someone with whom Mr. Swift has been close. It’s not to be. “I was actually in his company only a few times,” Mr. Swift writes, “widely spaced, over a period of more than 20 years.”

There are other sorts of things here  essays about reading aloud; about traveling as a young man in Greece; about the films made of Mr. Swift’s books; about what it’s like to be nominated for a Booker Prize. There are also mile-high flyovers of writers like Isaac Babel and Montaigne. But Mr. Swift’s heart isn’t quite in any of them.

Mark Twain wrote, famously, that the difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and lightning bug. Mr. Swift, in his essays, rarely bothers hunting for the perfect word, settling instead for dull, sweeping generalities.

On his Booker nomination: “I had high times and low times, got drunk a lot, missed a lot of sleep.” On reading his work aloud: “I suspect that the reality of readings will remain makeshift and multifarious, a thing of unpredictable splendors and miseries.”

He has a knack for wilted, even failed, aphorisms: “Writing and claustrophobia, or rather the need to overcome it, go together”; “Films begin more tangibly than novels”; “Aren’t we all apprentices to our hands?”

Reprinting interviews that one has given is a borderline practice, one that can reek of self-regard or the need to pad the page count. Mr. Swift includes not one interview but three. Two of these, inexplicably, are interviews in which he puts questions to other writers (Mr. Ishiguro and Mr. Phillips), and they are not especially revealing of them, much less himself.

There is one lovely piece of writing in “Making an Elephant,” the title essay, a memoir of his father. Mr. Swift’s writing comes alive. London seen from above at night is “a black bowl of jewels.” He tells us that his father, a World War II veteran who worked in England’s National Debt Office, was once asked on an application for his occupation. He wrote: “Drudgery.”

Mr. Swift treats the essays in “Making an Elephant” halfheartedly, as if somehow they don’t quite matter. And perhaps they don’t  or wouldn’t have, if he hadn’t gone to the trouble of wrapping them up and making us a present of them.

Something about this wan book, especially if you have paid $26.95 for it, may send you back to a comment Hughes made to Mr. Swift after fishing. Mr. Swift, who was about to return to London, said jauntily, “Back to the real world.” To which Hughes replied, somewhat sternly, “No, this is the real world.”
808 2009-06-24 Obesity is known to increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, a particularly aggressive type of cancer. But a new study suggests the risk is greatest among people who were already overweight during their teenage years or obese during their 20s and 30s.

Adults who were overweight as teens were twice as likely as similar adults who had never been overweight to develop pancreatic cancer later in life, and people who were obese as young adults were at more than twice the risk of adults who had never been obese, the study found.

“That’s an important finding, because it tells us that weight control at a younger age is really important if we want to reduce the risk of this disease,” said Donghui Li, a professor of cancer medicine at the University of Texas and an author of the new study.

The paper, to be published on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, compared 841 pancreatic cancer patients with 754 healthy people matched by age, race and sex. Personal interviews were done to obtain detailed histories of the participants’ height and weight at each age period, as well as information about alcohol use, smoking and family and personal medical backgrounds.

Smoking and diabetes also increased the risk of pancreatic cancer, with obesity accounting for 27 percent of cases and smoking for one-quarter of all cases. “Diabetes is a risk factor, but even without diabetes, obesity increases the risk,” Dr. Li said.
809 2009-06-24 Intel and Nokia said on Tuesday that they planned to jointly create mobile computing products that would meld the features of phones and computers.

Exactly what Intel and Nokia intend to do together remained unclear. Executives from the companies at a news conference pledged only to produce mobile devices that would have Internet access and run on Intel chips.

“We are exploring new ideas in shapes, sizes, materials and displays,” Kai Oistamo, an executive vice president at Nokia, said during the news conference. In an interview, he added, “We are not committing to any schedules or concrete product plans at this time.”

When asked directly, Mr. Oistamo declined even to confirm that Nokia would make phones using Intel’s Atom processors as a result of the deal.

Talk of merging cellphones and PCs has become commonplace from both personal computer and phone companies. “We are going to see a proliferation of devices, and you can call them whatever you want,” said Rebecca Runkle, the managing director at Research Edge, an equities analysis company. “Some of them are going to fail miserably, and some will be massive home runs that we can’t even envision yet.”
810 2009-06-24 “Relieved, pretty much relieved,” the 14th-seeded Safin said. “Was not really my day. Not the perfect thing. Not the way to finish the Wimbledon story. But anyway, it’s O.K. That’s life. There is plenty of years coming towards me.”

Listening to Safin, 29, letting go without regrets, it was hard not to think back to a match earlier in the day in which a 38-year-old in the midst of an unlikely comeback played each point as if it were a gift.

Kimiko Date Krumm, a Japanese icon who came out of a 12-year retirement last year, ultimately lost in three sets to a player not even half her age. But she stretched and confounded her 18-year-old opponent, Caroline Wozniacki, avoiding the powerful Danish youngster’s strike zone with a clever game plan that she executed with verve and delight.

Playing in her first Wimbledon since she reached the semifinals in 1996, Date Krumm scampered around the grass and sliced her two-handed backhand crisply. She hit flat forehands that landed deep and skidded. She served carefully and rushed the net regularly, but not too regularly.

In a sport dominated by big-swinging women accustomed to unloading on every shot from the baseline, it was like peeking inside a tennis time capsule, a place where the whole court and whole range of spins were back in play.

“Women’s tennis is everybody more taller, more powerful, more speedy,” Date Krumm said in her clear, imperfect English. “But tennis, my opinion, is more using the head.”

At times in the early stages, the ninth-seeded Wozniacki seemed as disoriented as if she had been obliged to play with a wooden racket.

“The game is just different from what I am used to,” she said of Date Krumm’s tactics. “She was playing really flat, and I really had to get under the ball a lot.”

Ahead by 7-5, 3-1, Date Krumm looked as if she might give the new Court 2 its first major upset. But just as the buzz was starting to build, Wozniacki began to stabilize and Date Krumm began to droop. She double faulted to lose her serve and Wozniacki held to get back to 3-3 with her most convincing backhand passing shot of the day.

“Second set, if I have extra power and energy, I think a little bit different story,” Date Krumm said.

Early in the third set, Date Krumm started cramping in her left thigh, receiving treatment on court and later wincing between rallies as Wozniacki went on to win, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1.

“I know why she did well on grass before for sure,” Wozniacki said.

Venus Williams has done well enough on grass to win five times at Wimbledon, including the last two titles. She returned to action by winning, 6-3, 6-2, against Stefanie Voegele, a 19-year-old Swiss newcomer, on Centre Court.

“It’s kind of ironic, but I’m very sure it will get some use soon,” Williams said of the new roof.

Although Safin faltered, his sister Dinara Safina did not. Grass is not the No. 1-seeded Safina’s favorite playground either, and her 7-5, 6-3 victory over Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain was not without difficulty, in part because she had to take an anti-inflammatory pill during the match because of knee stiffness.

Andy Roddick brushed aside the considerable threat posed by the young Frenchman Jeremy Chardy to win his first-round match, 6-3, 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-3.

It was a hot-and-cold day for American players. Melanie Oudin, a 17-year-old qualifier, created a surprise in her first Wimbledon match by defeating the 29th-seeded Sybille Bammer of Austria, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Then there was Robert Kendrick, a big-serving Californian ranked 76th, who drew the unenviable task of facing Andy Murray (and his nation) in the first round on Centre Court. Kendrick came close to ambushing Rafael Nadal in the same place in the second round in 2006, losing a two-set lead.

Kendrick again succeeded in making a showcase match very entertaining with his aggressive play and diving volleys, but he could not manage this upset either as Murray’s returns and range of shots eventually made the difference in a 7-5, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-4 victory.
811 2009-06-24 2. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet, and add the onion and diced chard stems, if using. Cook, stirring, until tender, about five minutes. Stir in the zucchini. Season to taste with salt, and cook, stirring, until just tender and still bright green, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, thyme and rosemary, and cook with the zucchini and onion until the garlic is fragrant, about one or two minutes. Stir in the greens, toss everything together, and remove from the heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

3. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Stir in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste), the zucchini mixture, and the Gruyère. Mix everything together, add pepper, taste once more and adjust seasoning.

4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Oil a 10-inch tart pan. Roll out two-thirds of the dough and line the pan, with the edges of the dough overhanging. Freeze the remaining dough. Fill the lined pan with the zucchini mixture. Pinch the edges of the dough along the rim of the pan. Place in the oven and bake 50 minutes, until set and beginning to color. Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes before serving (preferably longer). This can also be served at room temperature.

Yield: One 10-inch tart, serving eight to ten.

Advance preparation: The blanched greens will keep for three or four days in the refrigerator in a covered bowl. The finished tart keeps for a few days in the refrigerator. Reheat gently at 275 degrees to re-crisp the crust.

812 2009-06-24 Analysts said the company’s flight test schedule was so tight that the delay of several weeks would certainly push back plans to deliver the first 787 by next March.

“There’s no way that will hold,” Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, said. “This is a pretty late stage in the preflight test schedule to be finding structural showstoppers.”

And that only heightens concerns that Boeing could find more problems once the test flights begin. “This removes any hope that they’d gotten a handle around the likely risks of things they could find during the flight test program,” Mr. Aboulafia said.

Robert Springarn, an analyst at , said in a note to investors that the first delivery could be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2010, and Boeing might be able to deliver only six planes next year instead of what Credit Suisse had previously expected to be 33. He said the ramp-up in production could also be slower than expected in 2011 and 2012.

Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, said the problem “doesn’t help the company’s credibility.”

Any additional delay could provide more breathing room for rival , whose ultramodern A350 is years behind the 787 in development. Although Airbus has some 500 orders, the first delivery is not expected until mid-2013.

The setbacks both companies have suffered highlight the difficulty of pulling off increasingly complex engineering feats involving new materials and global supply chains. Airbus is still catching up from its own string of embarrassing delays in production of the A380 super jumbo, and has said recently that it will apply lessons learned from that experience — as well as Boeing’s recent woes — to building the A350.

Boeing executives said that the fixes to the 787 would require only a few small parts to reinforce areas of one to two square inches that displayed excess stress in a test that involved bending the wings. They said they would revise their financial guidance during their second-quarter earnings call in July.

Company executives said they discovered the structural weakness last month. They said they initially thought that it would not delay having the first flight by June 30, an idea that they continued to promote at the last week.

But in a conference call with reporters and analysts on Tuesday, Scott Carson, the chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane operations, said “it became apparent by Friday that the problem would limit how rigorous the flight could be.”

Pat Shanahan, Boeing’s vice president and general manager for airplane programs, said the excess stress was found in small areas with multiple materials, including titanium, aluminum and lightweight carbon composites that are one of the plane’s hallmarks.

He said the problem did not indicate there was any problem with the plane’s materials or workmanship.

Scott Fancher, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, said the company was evaluating several possible modifications, which would probably involve adding a few small parts to reinforce the areas. He said the fixes would not add much to the weight of the plane or affect its maneuverability.

Mr. Fancher said the areas that exhibited the stresses included parts designed by Boeing and two Japanese companies, which are also involved in designing the modifications. Problems with the plane’s global supply chain have contributed to other delays in the program.

Boeing said in December that the first flight of the Dreamliner would be in the second quarter of 2009, in time for deliveries to be made in the first quarter of next year. It had initially hoped the plane would fly before the end of 2008 and had expected to make its first deliveries in late 2009.

At that time, Boeing attributed the delay to a strike by the and also said it had encountered problems with fasteners used on early production airplanes.
813 2009-06-24 Christophe Prazuck, a spokesman for the French military, said in an interview that a French boat, the Pourquoi Pas, was continuing to trawl the area where the signal was last detected on Monday, but confessed that the sound was “very fleeting.”

“We continue to analyze the signal, but with little hope that it is from the recorders,” Mr. Prazuck said.

Four other French boats as well as a nuclear submarine have now been dispatched to other areas of the search zone, which spans a radius of 80 kilometers from the point where radio contact with the plane was lost.

“If we stop searching elsewhere, we may run out of time,” Mr. Prazuck said.

Hopes that the flight recorder had been found were raised when the French daily Le Monde reported on its Web site Tuesday that French naval vessels had picked up a weak signal from it and that a mini-submarine had been dispatched on Monday to try to find the black box on the bottom of the ocean floor.

The Brazilian and French recovery teams are continuing to search around the clock for the recorder, which contains data on the plane’s altitude, airspeed and heading and voice recordings from the cockpit. The search for the black box, which is actually bright orange and about the size of a loaf of bread, gains urgency with each passing day because the pingers are designed to emit a signal for only around 30 days. Once that deadline passes, the chances of finding the black box drop considerably, investigators have said.

The pingers have a very specific audio “signature,” emitting an electronic impulse in every direction, once per second. At 37.5 kilohertz, the ultrasonic signal is too high-pitched for the human ear to hear, but is distinct from the sounds produced by waves or underwater wildlife. It can be heard by specialized underwater microphones for a radius of up to 1.2 miles. But rough seas and variations in the salt content of the sea water can mask or distort the sound. The ocean floor near the presumed crash zone is also extremely rugged, meaning that the black box could lie up to two and a half miles below the surface.

The investigators have also cautioned that even if one or both of the pingers are found, it is still possible that they may have become separated from the black box on impact with the water.

Searchers have recovered 49 bodies so far and more than 400 pieces of debris.

837 2009-06-25 Venezuela and the United States are working to send ambassadors back to each other’s capitals, a State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said Wednesday. He said that it was unclear when the ambassadors would return or who they would be, but that the United States and Venezuela were “currently taking the necessary measures to accomplish” the goal of returning ambassadors to each country. A Venezuelan official, Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro, confirmed the American account. Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez, expelled Washington’s ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick Duddy, in September to show solidarity with Bolivia. President Evo Morales of Bolivia had ordered out the top American diplomat in his country, accusing him of helping the opposition incite violence there. Washington reciprocated by expelling both nations’ envoys.
838 2009-06-25 “Bosh! Come to the Knicks!” a fan shouted within the first few minutes of the game.

Hill also played for D’Antoni in Phoenix. Raja Bell, another former Sun, had agreed to play but did not make it. It was as if Nash, the part-time Greenwich Village resident, had assembled the D’Antoni All-Stars.

“I never thought about that,” Nash said with a chuckle, “but obviously I live in the city and I love Mike. So it would definitely be an exciting option for me.”

It was a tampering minefield. Had D’Antoni even ambled through the Lower East Side, it could have triggered an N.B.A. investigation.

Nash met last week with the Suns General Manager Steve Kerr to talk about a possible contract extension. But the Suns are in transition, dangling Shaquille O’Neal and Amar’e Stoudemire in trade discussions, wavering between contending and rebuilding. Nash is monitoring all of it and weighing his own options.

One of those options, of course, is declining an extension, entering free agency next summer and reuniting with D’Antoni. It is a Knick fan’s fantasy and a story line that already borders on cliché, so Nash can only smile and shrug.

“So much stuff’s got to happen for that to become a reality,” he said. “And there’s a ways to go before it can happen. So we can stop talking about it,” he added with a light chuckle.

Bosh also could sign an extension this summer but has indicated a preference to explore free agency.

Nash, as might be expected, provided some of the game’s best moments, including three goals in the first half. He scored with both feet. He completed the hat trick on a penalty shot, after an apparent foul by the ESPN.com reporter Marc Stein.

Bosh was another matter. Until Wednesday, his soccer experience was limited to occasionally watching games on television. He jogged cautiously around the field. He avoided any attempt to dribble the ball. He tried to head in a perfect crossing pass, but whiffed — the equivalent of an air ball. He inadvertently scored in his own goal, bumping the ball into the net after his goalkeeper fell.

Fans mostly cheered, as if they wanted to see Bosh succeed. This being New York, however, they also voiced their disappointment, to Bosh’s dismay.

“Don’t boo me!” he pleaded at one point, proving he might not be ready for Broadway after all.
839 2009-06-25 In the past, most drone attacks were focused around Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, and directed at targets that posed an immediate threat to the United States. These included foreign members of Al Qaeda or Taliban commanders who helped coordinate cross-border attacks on American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.

Recently, however, the drones have seemed to home in on Mr. Mehsud and his groups, which have posed a growing threat to the security of Pakistan through scores of suicide attacks in the country.

The apparent switch follows months of public and private complaints by Pakistani officials that the Americans were interested in using the drones only against individuals who threatened their own security interests in Afghanistan and beyond, not militants like Mr. Mehsud who had struck inside Pakistan.

That may be changing. The drones, which are operated remotely from the United States, carried out two strikes in Mr. Mehsud’s area in South Waziristan on Tuesday.

The first strike hit a compound in Ladha, a village in the mountains of western Pakistan that is Mr. Mehsud’s sanctuary. It killed Khwazh Wali, a Taliban leader who was a close aide to Mr. Mehsud, and three others.

Later Tuesday, Mr. Wali’s body was taken for burial to the village of Zangara, east of Makeen, where people, apparently including Mr. Mehsud, went to pay tribute to the Taliban fighter. It was unclear how long after Mr. Mehsud had left the village that the second drone sent three missiles hurtling into the large crowd.

Estimates of the number of dead varied. One security official said that as many as 80 people had been killed, but a local resident in a nearby town said the number was closer to 50. Pakistani television reported that more than 100 had been killed.

A resident supportive of Mr. Mehsud said by telephone from the area that none of the most senior leaders of Mr. Mehsud’s group had been killed.

Though Pakistani television networks reported widely that top commanders, including Qari Hussein and Sangeen Zadran, the Afghan commander close to Mr. Mehsud, had been killed, the resident in the area denied those men had been at the funeral.

Their deaths would have represented a serious blow to the Taliban, which relies on Mr. Hussein’s expertise to train suicide bombers.

Instead, the highest ranking Taliban commander killed in the attack on the funeral appeared to a leader known as Commander Bilal. He was in charge of Mr. Mehsud’s Shabi Khel tribe and a central figure in the Taliban movement, according to a Mehsud Taliban fighter who spoke by telephone on Wednesday evening.
840 2009-06-25 VisaNet’s offering will give them another chance to play. And at the midpoint of the offering’s expected price range, VisaNet would be valued at 10.2 times last year’s earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization. That is an enticing discount to Redecard’s 11.4 multiple.

VisaNet’s size and profitability dwarf those few American companies that have gone public this year. Given the strong reception those smaller deals enjoyed, it will be no surprise if investors choose to give VisaNet — and by extension the Brazilian government — some much-warranted credit.

Hedge fund investors have the whip hand. With managers desperate for capital after big losses in 2008, new investors have more clout than ever to negotiate fees and terms. But some fund bosses may have to do even more to stop existing investors from pulling out when they can.

Chris Hohn, founder of the Children’s Investment Fund, could be one manager to find this out. His fund made stellar returns in the boom, buoyed by coups like persuading ABN Amro to sell itself. But picking good targets for activism has become tougher. A recent campaign involving a Japanese electricity wholesaler largely failed, while an initially more successful effort at CSX, the railway company, fizzled out.

The Children’s Investment Fund, or T.C.I., an activist hedge fund based in Britain, lost more than 40 percent of its value in 2008, and some top staff members left. Investors, locked in for several years, could be forgiven for thinking Mr. Hohn should cut fees or make it easier for them to take money out.

With binding commitments from investors, Mr. Hohn could simply do nothing. But that’s inviting them to withdraw all their money as soon as they can. The prospect might deter new investors, too. It’s no surprise, then, that the fund has been in touch with investors to gauge their sentiment.

Certainly, plenty of other fund firms have given existing clients improved terms as an incentive to leave their money invested. In some cases, new investors are being wooed with lower fees. And big pension funds and other institutions are keen on changing the balance of power, for example by ensuring performance fees are based on several years’ returns, not just one at a time.

The average fund has bounced nearly 10 percent so far this year, according to Hedge Fund Research. If that carries on, the pendulum could swing back a bit toward the funds. But with investors still nervous, even this year’s star managers shouldn’t count on it — especially with existing clients still smarting from last year.
841 2009-06-25 The goal is to “creatively shine a light on your brand and put it in the forefront,” Mr. Cortizas said, and the series will “expose us to a major audience.”

“We couldn’t have a better way to relaunch a property,” he added, after travel to Mexico slackened because of swine flu.

Another innovative media approach is being taken by the Cayman Islands Department of Tourism, which helped support the production of a 90-minute movie, “Cayman Went,” filmed on the island Cayman Brac. The movie was the brainchild of Chowder, a New York agency that specializes in branded entertainment.

“The power of film to market a destination, a product, a service, is so great,” said Kim Ketchell, a partner and strategic director at Chowder who was the executive producer of “Cayman Went” with her Chowder colleague, Jim Ritterhoff. The movie played in theaters briefly this month in three cities — Miami, New York and Tampa, Fla. — selected because “they’re where Cayman Airways offers direct service,” Mr. Ritterhoff said. A DVD release is planned for the fall, to encourage travel to the Cayman Islands before the busy winter season.

Bob Garfield, the ad critic for the trade publication Advertising Age, panned “Cayman Went” as a marketing vehicle, in a review in this week’s issue. “Obviously, we’re not thrilled,” Mr. Ritterhoff said, “but we’re happy that he said it succeeded in not hitting you over the head” with its commercial purpose.

The subtler sell is a hallmark of several campaigns intended to stimulate summer travel. For instance, the Convention and Visitors Bureau in Panama City Beach, Fla., is starting an online campaign with the YouTube unit of Google. Users who upload video clips to YouTube may see ads inviting them to enter a video creation competition sponsored by Panama City Beach (realfuncontest.com), with $50,000 in cash and prizes.

“There’s a lot of destinations that have had a tougher go of it than we have,” said Dan Rowe, president and chief executive of the Panama City Beach bureau, “but it’s tough here.”

“Demand has not come up to meet an increase in supply” of hotel and motel rooms, he added, “so rates are suffering; there’s deals to be had.” The campaign for the video contest is from Jennifer Barbee Inc. in Austin, Tex.; it is part of a summer marketing initiative by Ypartnership in Orlando, Fla.

A Web site specializing in travel deals, Travelocity, is also hoping to capitalize on the consumer mania for thrift with a campaign carrying the theme “the summer of possibilities sale.” There will be elements featuring the company’s “roaming gnome” character in new media like Facebook and Twitter along with ads in traditional media.

The message is that “it’s an extraordinary time,” said Victoria Treyger, chief marketing officer at the San Francisco office of Travelocity, part of Sabre Holdings, because “you pay basically one-half of 2008 prices, so get out there and travel.”

“The getaway sale,” as the company called its campaigns in March and May, “did extremely, extremely well,” she added, so the idea is “to keep the momentum going during the summer months.” The online part of the campaign is by Click Here in Dallas and the rest is by McKinney in Durham, N.C.

Sales and deals may be inelegant, but that does not bother executives at the Palm Beach County Convention and Visitors Bureau in Florida.

“The only thing we want is to drive traffic,” said Bill Vervaeke, vice president for marketing and brand management at the bureau, “and this drives traffic.” His reference was to a campaign offering an extra night at 75 local hotels and resorts for $19.09 — a reference to the county’s founding in 1909 — after a stay of two, three or four nights (depending on the property).

A campaign for the promotion, created internally, carries the theme “the deal of the century.” It includes “lots and lots of radio,” Mr. Vervaeke said, because “I can put this proposition into 30 words.”

As summer travel increasingly seems to depend on whether the price is right, the Aloft Hotels brand — introduced last summer by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide — is supplementing a campaign concentrated on the Internet (explorealofthotels.com, created by Shift Control Media in Greenwich, Conn.) with blandishments like free breakfasts.

“Certainly we’re running more promotions than we would have,” said Brian McGuinness, senior vice president and global brand leader for specialty select brands at Starwood in White Plains, “but we’re fortunate to be in the right space at the right time” — rooms in the so-called select service segment of the lodging market, priced at $100 to $150 a night.

“That resonates with the current economic conditions,” he added. “We’re aren’t wizards; we happen to be lucky.”
842 2009-06-25 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, said Wednesday that it was officially postponing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, instead seeking to revise a merger with a publicly traded European affiliate that would give it an Amsterdam listing.

It is the latest twist for Kohlberg Kravis, which first sought an initial public offering nearly two years ago after similar moves by rivals. But the credit markets froze soon afterward, dimming considerably the attractions of being publicly traded.

Last summer, Kohlberg Kravis proposed buying out KKR Private Equity Investors, which trades in Amsterdam and invests in or alongside the private equity firm’s funds. Acquiring KKR Private Equity Investors, in which the buyout firm already held a 12 percent stake, was seen as a way to gain a public listing more quickly than through an initial offering. But the shockwaves of the financial crisis made it difficult for Kohlberg Kravis to go public.

Now, Kohlberg Kravis is seeking to revise the deal once more. Under the terms of the new proposal, the two firms would combine their entities, with Kohlberg Kravis holding 70 percent of the combined business and the private equity investors holding 30 percent. (The original plan would have given investors 21 percent at the outset and securities known as contingent value interests that could give them up to 27 percent.)

Kohlberg executives would reap about 40 percent of the combined business’ carried interest, which has long been the bulk of profits of private equity firms.

The combined business would remain listed on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange, but could transfer its listing to the N.Y.S.E., also owned by NYSE Euronext.
843 2009-06-25 Nike reported a worse-than-expected global decline in forward orders, sending its shares down 4.6 percent.

Orders through November fell 12 percent from last year, or 5 percent excluding currency changes.

Nike, the athletic shoe and clothing company, has been shedding 5 percent of its workers worldwide to reduce costs, but weak demand and currency fluctuations have hurt results.

The company said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $341.4 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $490.5 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago.

The results included a $144.5 million after-tax charge, or 29 cents a share, related to the job cuts and factory consolidation. Excluding those charges, Nike earned 99 cents a share; analysts had expected 96 cents.

Revenue slid 7 percent in the quarter, to $4.7 billion.

In forward orders by region, the Europe, Middle East and Africa unit had the greatest decline of 24 percent, while American future orders fell 4 percent.

Shares of Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., fell as low as $50.58 in after-hours trading, after closing at $53.02, down 52 cents.
844 2009-06-25 Q. I have several old home movies that were digitized and copied onto DVD. How can I convert the disc into a file that can play on my iPod Touch?

A. Plenty of programs can convert video files in various formats into iPod Touch-friendly clips that can be copied onto the player through iTunes. If you’re looking for a free option, a program like Videora Converter (www.videora.com) or HandBrake (handbrake.fr) works on either Windows or Mac systems.

Neither program decrypts commercially protected DVD movies on its own; HandBrake’s latest version removed the feature. But either should be fine for old personal video files on DVD. Follow the program’s instructions for converting the file. In iTunes, choose Add to Library from the File menu and import it. Once you import the video, add it to your Touch the next time you sync it up.
845 2009-06-25 MOSCOW — The recession in Russia will run deeper and longer than it appeared even a few months ago, the World Bank concluded in a report released Wednesday, underscoring the impression that Russia has been one of the countries hit hardest in the downturn.

The Russian economy, which seesaws from boom to bust along with commodity prices in the best of times, has experienced the most extreme swing from growth to contraction of any large economy in the current downturn.

The bank’s new projection showed that the Russian economy would contract by 7.9 percent this year and not recover to precrisis levels until at least 2012. Just before the crisis reached here, in the first quarter of 2008, Russia had been growing at an annual rate of 8.7 percent.

The bank’s estimate was all the more remarkable because oil prices have recovered recently, a positive sign for resource-dependent Russia. About two-thirds of exports, for example, are made up of oil and natural gas. Yet the International Monetary Fund, the Russian government and private banks all project slower growth.

The World Bank’s prediction on the timing of Russia’s recovery means nearly half a decade will be lost, Zeljko Bogetic, the bank’s chief economist in Russia, said at a presentation of the report.
846 2009-06-25 But as the stock market plummeted last year, some 2010 funds — which many investors thought would be invested safely by then to protect their nest eggs — lost 40 percent of their value. That showing was even worse than that of the Standard & Poor’s 500, which fell 38.5 percent.

Mary L. Schapiro, the chairman of the S.E.C., is now questioning whether fund companies misled investors about the risks associated with target-date funds, a concern the mutual fund industry says is unjustified.

Data collected by the S.E.C. shows that target-date funds vary widely in terms of their investment risks, even when they use similar target years or names. Even though federal officials put a stamp of approval on target-date funds, there are no clear standards about how they should work.

Funds marketed to people hoping to retire in 2010, for instance, have anywhere from 21 percent to 79 percent of their holdings in stocks, Ms. Schapiro said in a speech in New York last week, citing data collected by Morningstar.

No hard and fast rules exist for how to balance a portfolio as retirement approaches. A lot of variables come into play, including age, sources of income and appetite for risk. Some financial planners recommend that people who are at or near retirement age, and comfortable with some risk, invest about 40 percent of their portfolios in stocks.

But Ms. Schapiro said the S.E.C. was concerned that funds with the same target dates vary so widely in their investments and returns. The average 2010 fund had more than 45 percent of its holdings in stocks last year. The Fidelity Freedom 2010 Fund was 50 percent in stocks and lost a quarter of its value, according to Morningstar. The AllianceBernstein 2010 fund was 57 percent in stocks and fell by a third.

Funds leaning toward safer bonds, by contrast, fared far better. A Wells Fargo 2010 fund that was heavily invested in bonds lost just 11 percent, while a Deutsche Bank fund that also favored fixed-income investments was down just 4 percent.

“Funds with the same target date in their names can be structured, and thus perform, very differently,” Ms. Schapiro said.

Target-date funds have exploded since 2006, when Congress enabled companies to make them the automatic choice for employees who do not specify where they wanted to invest their 401(k) savings. The move, a boon for the mutual fund industry, occurred over the objections of insurance companies, whose money market-style “stable value” funds had been the default choice for 401(k) investments. About $182 billion has been poured into target-date funds, and fund companies have set up scores of them.

Now, in a reversal, a number of bills before Congress seek to provide greater disclosure of fees, more accurate marketing and improved financial advice to workers investing in target-date funds and other 401(k) funds.

“What we have is the Wild, Wild West of investing,” said David A. Krasnow, president of Pension Advisors, an asset management firm, at a hearing on June 18 held by the S.E.C. and the Labor Department. “Many people in target-date funds got run over by a truck and didn’t know why.”

Critics of target-date funds maintain that these investments are often opaque and difficult to understand. Mutual fund companies often create them by bundling existing mutual funds, some with good track records and some with worse records. This “fund of funds” concept enables mutual fund companies to collect more assets and fees, but can make it hard for investors to understand what these funds contain or how they are being charged.

Paul Schott Stevens, chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association, defended target-date funds. The institute supports some elements of the many proposed changes, but opposes others.

“The future is bright for target-date funds, which are a useful tool,” said Mr. Stevens. “The idea was to remove the prospect that younger people would invest only in fixed income and older people only in equities. And, it does seem to have moderated that investing at the extremes. Before this, people were radically misinvested.”

Such assurances aside, the S.E.C. is looking into whether putting a date in a fund’s name should be prohibited, whether there is enough information about the risk of these funds and whether they are properly structured to provide for a safe retirement. There is also legislation calling for greater fee disclosure, more objective investment advice and the inclusion of low-cost index funds in workers’ 401(k) plans.

If regulators do not act, members of Congress say they will. One of them is Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, who has been a critic of some aspects of target-date funds.

“At the end of the day, consumers need to know what they’re getting into.” Mr. Kohl said. “We’d like to see regulation, whether it’s a standardization of target-date composition, or increased clarification of information made available about the plans.”

If the combination of explosive growth and poor performance was not enough to raise alarms, another concern is that buyers of target-date funds are often the least sophisticated investors.

A study by Envestnet Asset Management and Behavioral Research Associations found a range of misconceptions, including that employees thought target-date funds would provide a guaranteed return, that their money would grow faster in target-date funds than in other investments, and that these funds allowed workers to put away less money and still be able to retire.

This conflict between perception and reality came into play at the joint S.E.C. and Labor Department hearing in Washington last week. Ms. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, asked about the extent to which these funds “are marketed as the solution and pushed as a be-all and end-all.”

Joseph C. Nagengast, a principal at Target Date Analytics, responded that “if you read the marketing brochure, you could relax because everything will be O.K. But if you read the prospectus, it tells you to be careful.” Representative Rob Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, worries that mutual fund companies that are advising employers on 401(k) plans are not disclosing enough about target-date funds or offering other options, like low-cost index funds.

“I’m not saying that pensions are being pillaged by greedy mutual fund companies,” said Mr. Andrews in an interview. “But I am saying that people should know how much they are paying and that investment advice should be in the best interest of the investor, not the adviser.”
847 2009-06-25 CHICAGO (Reuters) — The CME Group, parent of the Chicago Board of Trade, Wednesday disputed a Senate panel report that blamed commodity index funds for driving up wheat futures prices.

The panel, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released its 247-page report late Tuesday after a yearlong investigation led by Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the panel, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, its top Republican.

The investigation came after months of criticism by grain firms that the board of trade’s soft red winter wheat contract, the world benchmark for wheat prices, was broken.

Those firms complained that cash and futures prices no longer came together when futures contracts reached their expiration dates. That phenomenon, known as “convergence,” is essential for proper hedging by companies that purchase wheat for use in food products — as opposed to speculators who buy contracts with the intention of selling them later at a higher price to make a profit.

The CME Group said that fundamental supply-and-demand factors, not speculation, were responsible for the increased price volatility. It said its conclusion was backed up by studies conducted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Government Accountability Office; an industry consultant, Informa Economics; and the CME Group.

The studies also analyzed market conditions and trades made by index funds, the CME Group said.
848 2009-06-25 The Canadian violinist Lara St. John has dedicated much energy recently to contemporary music and unorthodox projects, recording works by John Corigliano and the Australian composer Matthew Hindson as well as a disc of polka-inspired music yet to be released. But she first came into the spotlight with music of Bach, which she performed in public appearances as a child and has since recorded.

On Tuesday evening at the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park, Ms. St. John was joined by her older brother, Scott St. John — a violinist, violist and member of the St. Lawrence String Quartet — for a spirited performance of Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins in D minor (BWV 1043). The work concluded an excellent concert by the Knights, a dynamic young chamber orchestra.

The St. Johns first performed the concerto in public when Lara (now 38) was 4 and Scott was 6. Their compelling collaboration here was notable for its fiery energy and nuanced phrasing. The large audience, many members armed with umbrellas and glancing frequently at the darkening sky, was attentive throughout. The mood was shattered only by a drunk, wandering through the crowd and shouting expletives.

Ms. St. John also offered an expressive and poised rendition of Bach’s Violin Concerto in E (BWV 1042), idiosyncratic in some of its phrasing. The Knights, who played standing, accompanied her with an admirable buoyant energy. Textures were impressively balanced despite the inevitable microphone distortions.

Colin Jacobsen, the violinist, and Alex Sopp, a flutist, were fine soloists in a fleet-footed interpretation of Bach’s “Brandenburg” Concerto No. 5 in D. Steven Beck’s dazzling harpsichord cadenza drew energetic applause.

Andrea Griminelli, another flutist, performed with verve and polish in Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor. Speaking from the stage he lightheartedly reminded the audience that the work’s movements are short and don’t require applause after each one.
849 2009-06-25 Before even broaching the tax increase — which Republican legislators said they would not accept and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, vowed to veto — Democrats failed to get enough Republican votes in the Assembly or Senate for the first of 20 proposed budget bills, which contained $11 billion in cuts. After the vote, the Senate president, Darrell Steinberg, dismissed lawmakers until Thursday.

In February, the Legislature passed a budget for both the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, but the legislation was dependent on the passage of several ballot propositions that were rejected by voters in May.

In response, Mr. Schwarzenegger has proposed $16 billion in cuts, largely to state programs for the poor, like the Healthy Family Program, the health insurance program that covers more than 900,000 children, and the state’s main welfare program, known as CalWorks, which provides temporary financial assistance to poor families. He also wants to borrow millions from local governments and release some prisoners early to save money.

Republican lawmakers are more or less on board with the governor other than on his plan to borrow from localities and release prisoners or lay off corrections officers.

Democrats wish to reduce the cuts, increase taxes on cigarettes, oil production and cars, and use some accounting maneuvers to get through the years.

The threat of i.o.u. warrants “underscores just how serious this situation is,” H. D. Palmer, the spokesman for the state’s Department of Finance, said in an e-mail message, “and why it’s absolutely critical for the Legislature to get a budget package to the governor in a form that he can sign — and do it in a matter of days.”

If all sides cannot come to an agreement by July 2, the unusual i.o.u’s will be issued to a plethora of creditors.

Borrowing money to cover the shortfalls, which is usually done as the Legislature bickers its ways to a budget this time of year, was made impossible this June by the banking crisis, and the Obama administration refused a request to back loans as well.

In 1992, Governor Wilson, a Republican, issued the i.o.u.’s to state workers; the workers immediately brought a lawsuit, contending that the state had violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. A federal judge approved a $558 million settlement, and some workers received additional vacation time.
850 2009-06-25 Stocks ended mixed but mostly higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the economy was on the mend.

Bond prices fell, however, after the Fed said it would not step up its spending to purchase Treasuries and other debt to lower interest rates.

The central bank’s decision Wednesday to leave its main lending rate at a low of zero to 0.25 percent was not a surprise, but some investors have been hoping the central bank would do more to revive the economy. Others wanted it to more clearly lay out how it would keep inflation in check.

“The Fed is still stuck on that tightrope of trying to make sure they provide enough reassurance to keep the recovery going but at the same time try to allay the concern that they won’t allow inflation to get going either,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.

In the economic assessment statement accompanying its rate decision, the Fed said the economy’s rate of decline appeared to be slowing. It noted that consumer spending had shown further signs of stabilizing although job losses, shrinking wealth and tight credit remained problems. Policy makers noted that energy and other commodities prices had risen, although they said “substantial resource slack” would probably rein in cost pressures and that inflation would “remain subdued for some time.”
851 2009-06-25 “When you jail the most prominent intellectual dissident of the country, whose writing activities had effectively been tolerated for many years, it sends an unambiguous signal of political hardening,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Mr. Liu’s case has become a public relations dilemma for Beijing officials because of his international prominence.

Xinhua said that Mr. Liu had confessed to police during a preliminary investigation. Prisoners in detention have few legal rights and are subject to pressure.

China Human Rights Defenders, a human rights advocacy group, said in a statement that it had learned from Mr. Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, that Mr. Liu had arranged in advance for Mo Shaoping, one of China’s best-known human rights lawyers, to defend him. But Mrs. Liu was told that Mr. Mo would not be allowed to defend Mr. Liu because he had also signed Charter 08, the group said.

Another prominent lawyer, Shang Baojun, has not been barred from representing him and so might be allowed to do so, the group added.

Charter 08 initially had 303 signatories and now has more than 8,000. Some Western experts have suggested that Mr. Liu played a role in drafting the document, but that has not been confirmed and he was reportedly under police surveillance long before his detention in December.

Charter 08 specifically calls for the abolition of the crime of “incitement of subversion of state power”, the offense for which Mr. Liu appears to have been arrested, although Xinhua did not cite the specific section of China’s criminal code that was invoked for the arrest.

Prominent human rights activists like Mr. Liu are generally not prosecuted unless top levels of the government have already decided that a conviction will be handed down by the courts.

Mr. Liu spent three years undergoing “education through labor” in the mid-1990s, after calling for new policies toward Taiwan. But that is an administrative procedure in China and distinct from the kind of criminal case that Mr. Liu now faces. Subversion is punishable in China by up to 15 years in prison.

Mr. Liu’s activism in the months leading up to the Tiananmen Square military crackdown in 1989 was followed by 19 months in prison, although he was never convicted and sentenced then.

Liu Xia has only been allowed to see her husband twice during his current detention, on Jan. 1 and March 20, China Human Rights Defenders said.

Amnesty International strongly criticized the decision to prosecute Mr. Liu.

“This use of state security charges to punish activists for merely expressing their views must stop,” said Roseann Rife, the group’s deputy program director for Asia and the Pacific. “This is another act of desperation by a regime that is terrified of public opinion.”

876 2009-06-26 Mr. Christie was praised as a hero by Republican members of the House subcommittee, one of whom offered to endorse his bid for governor and another who suggested he be nominated for a medal.

His interaction with Democrats on the panel frequently turned into clashes in which both sides interrupted and talked over each other. When one Democrat used a line from the classic Mafia film “The Godfather” to describe the pressure companies felt to accept any monitor a prosecutor suggested — calling it “an offer you can’t refuse” — Mr. Christie said he took the remark as a slur on his Italian-American lineage.

Deferred prosecution agreements allow corporations involved in fraud to avoid indictments by agreeing to repay their victims and pay for an outside monitor to ensure that they comply.

The Department of Justice has relied on them more heavily since 2002, when an obstruction of justice prosecution forced the Arthur Andersen accounting firm out of business and cost 75,000 people their jobs. The company’s conviction was overturned later.

Mr. Christie’s office used deferred prosecution agreements in seven cases, including the 2007 investigation of five companies that manufactured orthopedic hips and knees and were accused of engaging in a kickback scheme with orthopedic surgeons in order to defraud Medicare.

After Mr. Christie recommended Mr. Ashcroft’s firm to monitor one of the companies, Zimmer Inc., company lawyers objected to the Ashcroft Consulting Group’s plans to charge $1.5 million to $2.9 million a month. Mr. Christie declined to intercede in the billing dispute, according to an exchange of e-mail messages in October 2007 that the panel released Thursday.

When asked about the matter during the hearing, Mr. Christie said that his office was too busy to regulate every aspect of an agreement, and that news reports indicated that Mr. Ashcroft’s fees were in line with what other firms charged to act as a monitor.

“I was not in the least bit shocked to receive e-mails from high-priced lawyers arguing about fees,” he testified.

Mr. Christie also brushed aside charges that he had used a deferred prosecution agreement involving the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb to pressure the company into endowing an ethics chair at his alma mater, Seton Hall University School of Law. The company initiated the proposal to pay for ethics training at Rutgers, which already had a program, and switched to Seton Hall because it was New Jersey’s only other law school, Mr. Christie said.

He defended his decision to give a monitor contract to a former federal prosecutor, David Kelley, who had decided two years earlier not to seek charges against Todd Christie, Mr. Christie’s brother, who had been accused of securities fraud.

“My bother committed no wrongdoing,” Mr. Christie said, pointing out that neither the Department of Justice nor the Securities and Exchange Commission decided to pursue a case against him.

Mr. Christie’s testimony ended in politically charged bedlam. After two and a half hours, he told the panel chairman that, as he had previously informed the subcommittee, he had to leave to catch a train and attend to “pressing business” in New Jersey. When Democrats urged him to stay anyway and continued peppering him with questions, Mr. Christie and his entourage stood and marched out.

“It is very telling that Christie got up and walked out as he began to be questioned about the multimillion-dollar, no-bid contract given to the former U.S. attorney that refused to charge his brother,” said the New Jersey Democratic chairman, Joseph Cryan, said in a statement. “If Christie tried to answer for all the other multimillion-dollar, no-bid contracts he gave out to friends,” Mr. Cryan said, “he would have been testifying until Election Day, and none of his statements would have matched.”

Mr. Christie said it was unfortunate that the hearing had been turned into “a political circus,” and added that his answers were thorough enough to put the matter to rest.

“This should be the end of it, but it won’t be,” he said, as he and his aides hurried from the Capitol. “It’s all politics.”
877 2009-06-26 Raymond Diaz, another Hispanic officer, who is commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan North, will replace Chief Tuller as the commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan South (south of 59th Street).

Two minority captains will remain in their posts, but will be promoted to higher ranks. Capt. Rodney Harrison, the commanding officer at the 28th Precinct in Harlem, who is black, will be promoted to deputy inspector; and Deputy Inspector David Colon, second in command at the Community Affairs Bureau, who is Hispanic, will be promoted to inspector, officials said.

As a rule, civil service exams control promotions up to the rank of captain. Promotions above captain are discretionary, and police commissioners use the pool of captains to staff the department’s executive corps, from the positions of deputy inspector through chief.

The number of blacks among the officers who make up the department’s top tier — in the rank of captain or higher — is significantly higher now, both numerically and as a proportion, than it was at the end of the Giuliani administration in 2001, according to data from the department. In raw numbers, as of May 31 the number of blacks in the rank of captain or higher has risen to 34, from 22 at the end of 2001; the number of Hispanics in those ranks has risen to 56, from 27 at the end of 2001, the department’s figures show.

“This police commissioner rewards performance regardless of race or gender,” said Roy T. Richter, the president of the Captain’s Endowment Association, the union representing roughly 760 officers in the ranks of captain through deputy chief. “I have seen a number of deserving minority executives get promoted under Police Commissioner Kelly’s administration.”

Still, Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who could not speak specifically about Friday’s promotions, said that those currently in “policy-making leadership roles are over, over, overwhelmingly white males.”

But in his letter to Mr. Paterson, Mr. Kelly said that since 2002, “over half of all police officers hired by this agency have been members of the minority community.” In one sense, the ascendancy of minority officers in the higher ranks is a natural outgrowth of a department that is changing at the entry levels.

As of last month, a majority of the rank-and-file officers were members of minorities, the department said. Among officers, 28.7 percent were Hispanic; 18 percent black; 5.4 percent Asian; and 47.8 percent white.

As Mr. Kelly wrote to the governor, “As the increased number of minority officers who have been hired in recent years progress further in their Police Department careers, I fully expect the number of minorities in the department’s executive corps to increase as well.”

879 2009-06-26 Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, expressed no objection on Thursday to Kyrgyzstan’s decision to allow the United States to continue operating an air base that assists its mission in Afghanistan. The Kyrgyz government ordered the base closed in February, apparently at Russia’s urging. After the United States agreed to pay more rent and to some minor restrictions, the Kyrgyz government rescinded its decision, and it was formally approved by the Kyrgyz Parliament on Thursday. Mr. Medvedev, on a visit to Namibia, did not offer any insight into Russia’s role in the reversal, which occurred two weeks before President Obama was due in Moscow for a summit meeting. But Mr. Medvedev told reporters that all nations in the region wanted the United States to succeed in Afghanistan. “We are helping them,” he said. “Other Central Asian countries are helping. And the Kyrgyz are ready to do that. That’s fine. I think that it will be for everybody’s benefit.”
880 2009-06-26 WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sharply criticized Judge Sonia Sotomayor on Thursday, accusing her of relying too heavily on international law in her opinions, which he said raised doubts in his mind about how she would interpret the Constitution as a member of the Supreme Court.

“What, if any, is the appropriate role for foreign law to play in the interpretation of our Constitution?” Mr. Sessions asked in a speech on the Senate floor. “It’s a question that has the potential to impact our fundamental rights.”

“The novel idea that foreign law has a place in the interpretation of American law creates numerous dangers and a number of academics and even federal judges are, I would say, seduced by this idea,” he said. “Judge Sotomayor clearly shares in that.”

The debate over the role of international law in American jurisprudence is not all that new, but it has been a point of disagreement among current justices on the Supreme Court.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and is often the swing vote these days, supports the consideration of foreign and international law in the interpretation of the Constitution — a view shared by more liberal justices including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
881 2009-06-26 On Wednesday, four days after the last American base in Sadr City closed, a bomb hidden on a motorcycle cart killed at least 76 people and wounded more than 150 in a market in the neighborhood. On Thursday, at least seven bombs exploded around the country in what appeared to be a message from extremists days before the deadline.

A great deal of Mr. Maliki’s political support rests on the fact that violence has declined since the carnage of 2006 and 2007, that he has rebuilt the security forces, that he has presided over the beginning of the end of the American war. He rarely mentions any American role in the improved security in Iraq — though 130,000 American troops remain in the country.

“We will not ask them to intervene in combat operations related to maintaining public order,” he said in an interview with Le Monde published last week. “It is finished.”

With the deadline now only days away, a drastically reshaped American military posture has emerged, largely because of Mr. Maliki’s insistence.

Bases built over months and years have been dismantled, often in weeks. The once ubiquitous presence of American armored vehicles on Baghdad’s streets has largely ended.

More than 150 American bases or outposts have been closed in Iraqi cities this year — 85 percent of the total, an Iraqi official said — including some that commanders considered crucial.

The Americans asked to keep open an outpost in Sadr City, the Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad that once served as the base of Shiite militias, only to be rebuffed.

“This is one we wanted,” Brig. Gen. John M. Murray said. “The Iraqi government said ‘no,’ so now we are leaving.”

The Americans even acquiesced to requests to suspend virtually all American operations — even in support roles — for the first few days of July to reinforce the perception that Mr. Maliki desires: that Iraqi security forces are now fully in control of Iraq’s cities.

“They will be invisible for the people,” Ali al-Adeeb, a senior leader in Mr. Maliki’s Dawa Party, said of the Americans. “They will turn into genies.”

Far from a celebration, the deadline has provoked uncertainty and even dread among average Iraqis, underscoring the potential problems that Mr. Maliki could face if bloodshed intensifies.

Even some Iraqi officers are worried. Brig. Gen. Mahmoud Muhsen, a commander with the First Division of the Iraqi National Police, grimly predicted that sectarian violence could return. He warned that control of Iraq’s borders remained ineffective, allowing more foreign fighters to enter.

“They are taking away all the equipment that the Americans provide,” he said, “and with the agenda of countries neighboring Iraq, it is a recipe for disaster.”

The Sadr City attack, like others recently, appeared intended to discredit Mr. Maliki’s government, to test its security forces and to undermine the public sense of improving security. To some degree, they already have.

“When the Americans get out of city centers, a big war will start,” a woman who identified herself as Um Hussan said amid the wreckage of a bombing on Monday outside her house in the Ur neighborhood of Baghdad. It has been months, she added, since she last saw American forces there.

“We ask God to help us for what is coming,” she said.

Iraqi and American officials anticipate attacks in the days surrounding Tuesday’s deadline, as extremists, Sunni and Shiite, seek to exploit the American withdrawal.

The security agreement between Iraq and the United States that set the June 30 deadline for withdrawing from the cities, and from the country by 2011, gave American commanders broad discretion to continue operations.

But decisions on what Americans remain where — doing what — ultimately now rest with the Iraqis, and the Americans have deferred in negotiations.

“We will be gone in whatever way the Iraqi government tells us to be gone,” said Lt. Col. Timothy M. Karcher, commander of the forces departing Sadr City.

It is far from a complete withdrawal, of course. Thousands of American troops will remain in Baghdad and other cities, merely shifting their role from combat to training and advising. So far there are no restrictions yet on the American use of helicopters, a regular reminder overhead of remaining firepower.

The Americans have been strikingly sensitive to Mr. Maliki’s political position, emphasizing Iraqi primacy in all public remarks. They have declined to specify how many American troops will remain in cities, seemingly fearful of undercutting Mr. Maliki’s public declarations of a full withdrawal.

The chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Stephen R. Lanza, said that only an “extremely small” number would remain at the request of the Iraqis, conducting training and operations that the Iraqis could not yet do on their own, like emergency medical evacuation.

Much of the complicated work of dismantling and removing millions of dollars of equipment from the combat outposts in the city has been done during the dark of night. Gen. Ray Odierno, the overall American commander in Iraq, has ordered that an increasing number of basic operations — transport and resupply convoys, for example — take place at night, when fewer Iraqis are likely to see that the American withdrawal is not total.

In his discussions with the Americans, officials said, Mr. Maliki has shown far more pragmatism than his public remarks about repulsing foreign occupiers might suggest, requesting, for example, that American explosive removal teams keep sweeping Baghdad’s streets.

Still, his strong language and what one Western adviser described as his inflated sense of the abilities of his own forces have left him little room, politically, to backtrack should the security situation worsen significantly.

“Symbolically,” General Lanza said of the withdrawing American forces ahead of Tuesday, “this is what we want for the Iraqis as a sovereign nation.”
882 2009-06-26 “Derivatives,” he testified, “provide a means for obtaining a leveraged position without explicit financing or capital outlay and for taking risk off-balance sheet, where it is not as readily observed and monitored.” They let institutions dodge taxes and accounting rules.

“Viewed in an uncharitable light,” he added, “derivatives and swaps can be thought of as vehicles for gambling; they are, after all, side bets on the market.”

And they were side bets that could destabilize the markets. Had American International Group been gambling in regulated markets, it would have been required to put up collateral when prices began to go against it. Instead, it was able to ignore the problem until its own collapse — and perhaps that of the financial system — was imminent.

Even when derivatives do allow financial risks to be transferred, that is not always a good thing. John Kay, a leading Scottish economist, noted recently that he used to teach — along with most other economics professors — that derivatives allowed risks to be transferred to those better able to bear them.

But, he added, experience had shown that to be wrong. Now, he said, he teaches that derivatives allow risk to be shifted from those who understand it a little to those who do not understand it at all. That is not a bad description of how the risks of bad mortgage loans were transferred from those who made the loans to those who bought troubled collateralized debt obligations.

We would be much better off as a society if that particular transfer of risk had been regulated, or even prevented. At a minimum, there should have been a lot more disclosure about just what was going on.

The Obama administration’s outline for bringing the derivative markets under regulation addresses all the important issues. But the details, to be worked out in legislation and later in regulations, will be critical. Wall Street will try to keep as much of the market as possible from moving to exchanges, where prices would be transparent and those taking risks would have to put up collateral immediately when prices moved against them.

Instead, the derivatives industry has already started a public relations campaign claiming that it is helping businesses, particularly small ones, hedge their risks by devising custom derivatives and not requiring the customers to post liquid assets when they begin to lose money. They argue that forcing companies to put up cash when they gamble would take money away from the companies’ productive investments, and thus damage the economy.

It would also mean that those gambles could not destroy the companies making them. All too often, Wall Street has come up with complicated vehicles with little upfront costs but huge potential risks, and made lots of money on them from customers who are in no position to assess the fair value of the derivative or to bear the losses if the risks materialize.

The Obama administration has embraced the principle that complicated, illiquid derivatives should require higher margins from customers. If there is to be effective regulation, it is critical that the administration prevail on that issue.

It is also important that as much derivative trading as possible be pushed into standardized, exchange-traded contracts. The customers should be demanding that, simply because it would reduce their transaction costs, but many have been persuaded by the claim that customized products serve their needs better.

And sometimes the customers like the complexity. It makes it easier to hide the risks and leverage they are taking, as well as the noneconomic objectives — such as evading regulations — that they may prefer not be noticed by authorities.

Given the overlaps of the derivatives, commodities and securities markets, nearly everyone who has studied the issue thinks it would make sense to merge the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. But the agencies are overseen by differing Congressional committees that wish to retain their influence, and the campaign contributions that influence attracts. The administration evidently decided that was not a fight worth making.

Instead, Ms. Schapiro and Mr. Gensler hammered out a general agreement on which agency should regulate which product. It’s not perfect, but it could work, particularly if the regulators hire people, such as Mr. Bookstaber, who understand how the games are played.

There could even be an advantage for the public in multiple regulators. Back in the Clinton administration, when Wall Street was persuading Congress to allow derivatives to escape nearly all oversight, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., Brooksley Born, sounded the warning about the risks of that course. She lost. Had she prevailed, the financial disaster might not have happened.

In the future, it is at least possible that if one agency is effectively taken over by those it regulates, the other might be able to protest and get public attention.

Despite the clear evidence that Warren Buffett was right when he called derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction,” there has been little talk of giving regulators authority to ban some derivatives.

Perhaps, however, the Obama administration has that idea up its sleeve. Its white paper on financial regulation calls for authority to prevent “market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses.” My efforts to find out just what is included in that last catch-all category were not successful.

When the derivatives industry was persuading Washington to let it alone, one argument was that any American rules would just drive business overseas, hurting American competitiveness. That argument will be heard again, and makes it necessary that there be international regulatory cooperation. But the fact that some market allows something is not enough to prove everyone should allow it.

For far too long, Wall Street was allowed to play as it wished. It is a major understatement to say that privilege was abused. The details of derivatives regulation adopted this year will go a long way to determining whether and when the next financial crisis will engulf the world.
883 2009-06-26 Jaws are dropping all over Hollywood. Optimus Prime helped the Autobots and “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” open sharply above even robust expectations on Wednesday with $60.6 million in ticket sales in North American, according to Paramount Pictures. The gear-grinding sequel, a co-production with DreamWorks Pictures and directed by Michael Bay, is on track to generate around $175 million in total sales by Sunday. The movie, despite generally dismal reviews, appears to have set a record for a Wednesday opening, beating “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” which drew $44.2 million on its Wednesday opening in 2007.
884 2009-06-26 WISCONSIN ’S quiet beauty and small-town culture have made it popular with stressed-out Chicagoans desperate for a break. But in the 1920s and ’30s it offered a different kind of getaway for harried Midwesterners.

For bad guys on the lam, Wisconsin was once the refuge of choice. Al Capone, John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson all headed for the state’s north woods when the heat was on.

Some of the places where those public enemies sought a bit of peace in their not-so-peaceful lives still exist, and visitors can follow an itinerary from the state tourism agency and disappear themselves down the back roads of northern Wisconsin for a few days.

A good starting point is the Four Seasons Resort on Miscauno Island in the Menominee River, the border with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where Capone is said to have often been a guest.

Opened in 1905 as the Miscauno Inn, the hotel first served a Chicago railroad clientele before changing hands, being destroyed by fire and becoming an exclusive club and golf course for the well-heeled from Chicago in 1925.

Today it still has a middle-of-nowhere appeal, and though management for many years flat-out denied there was any evidence that Capone ever stayed or even visited, the stories persist. I nosed around, and a staff member took me upstairs to a renovated event space that believers say was once Capone’s room of choice.

Another staff member, who — perhaps wisely — insisted on remaining anonymous, said that in the 1920s Four Seasons and three other private resorts in the area all had armed guards and barbed-wire fences. She repeated management’s contention that the gangster pedigree was only hearsay, then added, “But would you want your family to be associated with them?”

Capone’s trail leads west toward Bugsy’s Sports Grille in Rhinelander, through land once clear cut by 19th-century lumber barons and now thick with second-growth pine.

There, local legend has it that behind a basement wall is a Prohibition-era escape tunnel that Capone and others used when the T-Men came knocking.

The bartender waved it off. “You can’t swing a cat around here without hitting a place where they say Capone has been,” he said.

Even if Capone didn’t leave much solid evidence, it’s possible to follow the route taken by F.B.I. agents in April 1934 when they flew into Rhinelander and raced northwest to Manitowish Waters in hopes of capturing Dillinger and his gang of bank robbers. The coming film “Public Enemies” — er, shot around Wisconsin — has heightened interest in the gangster haunts, particularly Dillinger’s.

At the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, the gang, including Baby Face Nelson, escaped a bungled F.B.I. raid. Now a supper club, Little Bohemia became an attraction almost before the gun smoke cleared.

Emil Wanatka, the owner at the time, left the bullet holes in the windows and walls, and people drove miles to see them. Later, celebrities like Clark Gable and members of the Green Bay Packers were known to stop in for a meal.

The arrival of filmmakers last year again put the lodge on the tourism map. I asked the bartender there what “they” had eaten. He answered, “They all had chicken and ribs.”

“Huh?” he said. “Oh, I thought you meant the film crew. Yeah, Dillinger, too.”

Appropriately, I had a Wisconsin farmhouse ale, Spotted Cow, and chicken and ribs with potato pancakes.

From there it was a 20-minute drive to Dillman’s Bay Resort in Lac du Flambeau, where I checked into Cabin 5. Back in the 1930s Ollie Catfish owned the cabin, but on a plot across the lake. At some point after the raid, it was dragged across winter ice to its present site. Escaping the Little Bohemia raid, Nelson had somehow run 18 miles through forest and marsh at night to find it, and locals say he held Mr. Catfish hostage.

Competing bootleggers weren’t the only things Chicago’s rough crowd were fond of shooting. Capone and another gang leader, Joe Saltis, enjoyed hunting game in Wisconsin, as well as fishing and a bit of backwoods golf.

Saltis, not nearly the name these days that Capone is, only reached No. 9 on Chicago’s public enemies list, despite controlling the liquor trade on the city’s southwest side. In Winter, Wis., is the Barker Lake Lodge, a two-story log structure next to a golf course, both built by Saltis in the late 1920s. Today, the walls of the clubhouse are covered with old photos and articles about Saltis, who retired to the area around 1930.

David and Brenda Palmer, current owners of the lodge, showed me a bullet hole above the fireplace, and around the property, Mr. Palmer has dug up .45 shell casings — the caliber of a Tommy gun.

The night I stayed there, Mr. Palmer shared stories and newspaper clippings. He, in turn, occasionally receives visitors with stories of their own.

He once met the son of a man who rowed the boat when Capone visited Saltis to fish for sturgeon. The six- to eight-foot fish can live up to 100 years. “Capone could have caught a 10-year-old sturgeon,” he said, “thrown it back because it was too small, and today you could catch the same sturgeon Al Capone caught.”

There’s some evidence that no matter how heinous their actions elsewhere, the criminal element minded their manners in Wisconsin, perhaps tamed by the sense of solitude they found there. In all his years at Barker Lake, Mr. Palmer said, Saltis apparently had only one run-in with the local law — when he was fined for fishing too close to a dam.

885 2009-06-26 Though, of course, it was her early work that kept her famous. Nobody in recent memory comes close to the giddy heights Farrah Fawcett reached in the mid-’70s with one season on “Charlie’s Angels” and That Poster. The pinup of Ms. Fawcett in a red one-piece bathing suit, tanned, head tossed, body lithe yet curvy, was a revelation. She looked delicious but also a little carnivorous, her gleaming white teeth frozen in a friendly but slightly feral smile. That poster ended up on every teenage boy’s bedroom wall and in the annals of pop culture — Farrah was the face, body and hair of the 1970s

More recently Ms. Fawcett became almost as well known as fame’s camp follower after a dizzy, incoherent interview on David Letterman in 1997..

That bad moment was reinforced by an ill-advised 2005 TV Land reality show, “Chasing Farrah,” the kind of doomed career defibrillator that was parodied so brilliantly by Lisa Kudrow in “The Comeback.” A camera crew followed Ms. Fawcett as she giggled and tossed her golden mane at movie openings and on shopping sprees — more Blanche DuBois than “Charlie’s Angels.” In one scene, as Ms. Fawcett strode ahead in a cloud of fans and paparazzi, a stocky, balding man in a T-shirt told the camera with a leer, “I’d do her,” as if that would be doing her a favor.

Ms. Fawcett left “Charlie’s Angels” after only one season, the queen of “jiggle TV.” She had a dazzling smile underscored by a whispery baby voice, a sweetness that allowed young male fantasists to believe that she would be a forgiving sex goddess. Bo Derek and Pamela Anderson, physical prodigies who took her place on dorm-room walls, seemed less approachable — they were positioned more as parodies of sex symbols than the real thing and seemed perfectly content in that niche.

Ms. Fawcett was built on a more human scale, a cheerleader from Corpus Christi, Tex., who radiated a healthy athleticism just ahead of the aerobics revolution led by Jane Fonda and Jamie Lee Curtis.

She made movies like “The Cannonball Run” but also set her sights on Broadway long before it became fashionable and profitable for theaters to boost ticket sales by recruiting television and movie stars to perform onstage. And in 1983 she dared to take over a role originated by Susan Sarandon in “Extremities,” in the grueling role of a rape victim who seeks revenge on her attacker. That performance led to “The Burning Bed,” a 1984 TV movie in which she played a battered wife and which was a television milestone; it helped her secure the lead in the 1985 film version of “Extremities.”

She took on other ambitious roles, not as persuasively perhaps, but they were brave choices nonetheless: the Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld in a 1986 television movie; the heiress Barbara Hutton a year later; and in 1989, the wartime photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White.

Her career took a detour in 1997 — that was the year of a Playboy spread and her infamous David Letterman interview, but it was also the year she played Robert Duvall’s wife in “The Apostle,” an affecting performance that was well received by critics, if not widely seen. She kept at it, though the offers kept shrinking; her last movie was a small part in “The Cookout,” the 2004 Queen Latifah comedy.

Toward the end, her private life — her son’s drug problems, her on-and-off relationship with the troubled Ryan O’Neal — eclipsed decades of work. Cancer brought it to an end.

Not all of her performances will stand the test of time, but what is worth remembering is how hard Farrah Fawcett tried.
886 2009-06-26 WASHINGTON  A strip search of a 13-year-old girl by officials at her middle school violated the Constitution, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday in an 8-to-1 decision.

The student, Savana Redding, had been suspected of bringing prescription-strength ibuprofen to the school, in Safford, Ariz.

Justice David H. Souter, writing for the majority, said a search of Ms. Redding’s backpack and outer garments did not offend the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches. But the pills in question, each no stronger than two Advils, did not justify an “embarrassing, frightening and humiliating search,” Justice Souter wrote.

School officials ordered Ms. Redding, whom another girl had accused of giving her drugs, to strip to her bra and underpants and to pull them away from her body, exposing her breasts and pelvic area. No drugs were found.

The case attracted national attention and gave rise to an intense debate over how much leeway school officials should have in enforcing zero-tolerance policies for drugs and violence. Some parents were outraged by the intrusiveness of the search, while others worried about tying the hands of school officials charged with keeping their children safe.

The case also revealed a gender fault line at the court. In an unusual interview about a pending case, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told USA Today in the spring that judging from their comments at the argument, her colleagues, all men, had failed to appreciate what Ms. Redding had endured.

“They have never been a 13-year-old girl,” Justice Ginsburg said. “It’s a very sensitive age for a girl. I don’t think that my colleagues, some of them, quite understood.”

In the end, Justice Ginsburg’s view of the constitutionality of the search prevailed.

But the decision did not offer particularly clear guidance to school personnel, who were told only to take account of the extent of danger of the contraband in question and whether there is good reason to think it is hidden in an intimate place. So the upshot of the decision in a practical sense may well be to eliminate strip searches in schools.

“A number of communities have decided that strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have banned them no matter what the facts may be,” Justice Souter said, citing a regulation of the New York City Department of Education banning such searches in all circumstances.

The court stopped short, however, of allowing Ms. Redding’s lawsuit to go forward against the assistant principal who ordered the search and the two female school officials who conducted it. The state of the law at the time of the search, in 2003, was too murky to allow the officials to be sued, Justice Souter said.

A separate claim against the school district based on its practices and policies was not part of the district’s appeal to the Supreme Court and will proceed.

Justices Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens would have allowed the claims against individual school officials to go forward. “This is, in essence, a case in which clearly established law meets clearly outrageous conduct,” Justice Stevens wrote.

Only Justice Clarence Thomas would have ruled the search constitutional. “Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution,” he wrote.

Justice Thomas also said Thursday’s decision provided the nation’s students a court-sanctioned hiding place.

“Redding would not have been the first person to conceal pills in her undergarments,” he wrote. “Nor will she be the last after today’s decision, which announced the safest places to secrete contraband in school.”

Ms. Redding, now 19, said in a telephone interview that she was “pretty excited” by the decision. “It makes me feel good,” she said, “that they recognized that it was against my rights and that it most likely won’t happen to anyone else.”

A lawyer for the school district said that the decision “offers little clarification” concerning when such searches are allowed and that it could have dangerous consequences.

The decision unduly limits “the ability of school officials to protect students from the harmful effects of drugs and weapons on school campuses,” the lawyer, Matthew W. Wright, said in a statement.

“We can only hope that this decision does not compound the problem further,” Mr. Wright said, “by emboldening more students to smuggle such contraband into the nation’s schools.”

The majority made clear that school searches were subject to less exacting constitutional standards than those conducted by the police. Where the police must generally have probable cause to conduct searches, school officials need have only “a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing,” Justice Souter wrote.

Nor did the majority take issue with the zero-tolerance rule at Safford Middle School.

“There is no need here either to explain the imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons for the school’s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign,” Justice Souter wrote. “Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to identify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforceable fast.”

But a search of the sort Ms. Redding underwent must be supported by more than another student’s accusation, Justice Souter said.

“The content of the suspicion,” he wrote, “failed to match the degree of the intrusion,” particularly given “the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs” at issue.

At the argument of the case, Safford Unified School District v. Redding, No. 08-479, in April, Justice Stephen G. Breyer suggested that the search of Ms. Redding was in some ways comparable to her changing into gym clothes.

“Changing for gym is getting ready for play,” Justice Souter wrote. “Exposing for a search is responding to an accusation reserved for suspected wrongdoers and fairly understood as so degrading” that many schools never allow the practice.

891 2009-06-27 George K. Fraenkel, one of the first chemists to use electronic techniques to explore the fundamental structure of molecules, a breakthrough that has led to advances in several fields of science, died in Manhattan on June 10. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.

Dr. Fraenkel was chairman of the chemistry department at Columbia University from 1965 until 1968, when he was appointed dean of the university’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Starting in the early 1950s, when he was a professor, Dr. Fraenkel was one of several chemists who developed high-sensitivity, high-resolution spectrometers that could track the spin of electrons and thereby obtain information on very small structures.

“His work has laid the foundation for later work toward understanding the properties of many biological systems,” Jack H. Freed, the Frank and Robert Laughlin professor of physical chemistry at Cornell University, said in an interview on Friday.

Dr. Fraenkel’s research helped develop and apply techniques of what is called electron spin resonance for applications in chemistry research, including determining the electronic structure of molecules and how molecules move in liquids. Dr. Freed said the methods Dr. Fraenkel helped pioneer had since been applied to research in physics, biology and medicine.
892 2009-06-27 JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are expanding their “jumbo” mortgage businesses used to buy the most expensive homes, helping revive a market that shriveled amid a three-year jump in homeowner defaults. JPMorgan resumed buying new jumbo loans made by other lenders this month, after halting purchases in March, a spokesman said. Citigroup is again offering the loans through independent mortgage brokers, a spokesman said. The two New York-based banks are signaling new interest in a market hobbled since 2007, when record-breaking defaults on home loans caused investors to flee securities backed by mortgages.
893 2009-06-27 Palm, maker of the new Pre smartphone, had its best day in five months in Nasdaq trading after reporting a smaller loss than analysts had estimated and spending less cash. Palm said it had cash and equivalents of $255.1 million as of May 29, the end of its fourth quarter. The company spent $72.4 million in cash in the period, less than the $92.1 million in the previous quarter. The company plans to start generating cash in the second half of this fiscal year, bolstered by the Pre and its new WebOS operating system. Palm introduced the Pre on June 6, challenging Apple’s iPhone and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry.

While last quarter’s results did not include Pre sales, Palm showed it was on better financial footing, said Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup in San Francisco. Palm rose $2.20, or nearly 16 percent, to close at $16.22.
894 2009-06-27 The big question now is what happens to his assets. So far, that is unclear even to Mr. Jackson’s closest representatives, several of whom were hired only weeks ago, in Mr. Jackson’s latest round of managerial housecleaning. They say it could take years to sort through the financial and legal mess left after the singer’s death, not to mention millions of dollars worth of tickets sold for a series of 50 concerts Mr. Jackson had planned in London.

Mr. Malnik, for example, said that in 2004 he agreed to be the executor of Mr. Jackson’s estate. “I said yes, but I never inquired further, and I don’t know what’s happened since then,” he said. Mr. Malnik said there was still a chance that he was an executor, but had not heard anything since the death. Other advisers said that Mr. Jackson left behind at least two wills.

It is also unclear how much would be left for any heirs. It has been estimated that Mr. Jackson earned about $700 million as a performer and songwriter from the 1980s on, much of it spent. And his debts have been estimated at $400 million to $500 million.

His single biggest asset is a 50 percent share in Sony/ATV Music Publishing — which owns the rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, along with thousands of others — valued at more than $500 million, but he has about $300 million of debt against it held by Barclays, Mr. Jackson’s biggest creditor. He also owns his own publishing catalog, called Mijac, which is estimated to be worth $50 million to $100 million, and has an unknown amount of debt attached.

In late 2005, while Mr. Jackson was living in the Middle East after being acquitted of child molestation, his finances were particularly precarious. Sony then negotiated a deal with the singer that resulted in Mr. Jackson paying a lower interest rate on his debt in return for Sony gaining more authority to operate Sony/ATV and the option to buy half of Mr. Jackson’s share.

One question Sony executives have now is with whom they will negotiate. Mr. Jackson’s share is owned by a trust that he set up around the time of his molestation trial in 2005; people close to the situation say that his mother, Katherine, now controls it.

Mr. Jackson’s investment in song catalogs was no accident. Contrary to his popular image as a naïf, he took an active interest in the wider music business, associates say, with a shrewdness he inherited from his father, who shaped the careers of Michael and his brothers.

Martin Bandier, chairman and chief executive of Sony/ATV, said that Michael Jackson “had a keen sense of the value of music copyrights” and was a highly effective dealmaker.

“There was nobody better to close a deal,” Mr. Bandier said. “Michael called Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller a few years back to tell them that he wanted to buy their copyrights and that they would have a safe home at Sony/ATV.”

Mr. Jackson also negotiated a favorable royalty rate with Sony for his recordings; according to some estimates, he earned at least $300 million in record royalties since the early 1980s. And since Sony’s rights to his master recordings are set to expire in the next several years and would become owned by Mr. Jackson, according to one of his advisers, his estate would stand to earn even more from sales and from the licensing of music to film, television and any other media.

On the other side of the ledger, however, was Mr. Jackson’s biggest liability: his exorbitant lifestyle. His large Neverland estate in California, which contained a zoo and an amusement park and at its peak had as many as 150 employees, cost millions of dollars each year to maintain. He nearly lost it last year when he defaulted on a $24.5 million loan.

Neverland was saved by a real estate company, Colony Capital, and according to court papers, Mr. Jackson then contracted for an auction of memorabilia from the ranch. About 2,000 items — like statues of E. T. and 13 of Mr. Jackson’s trademark glittering gloves — were to be put up for sale in April 2009, and the value of the auction was estimated at up to $20 million.

But with only weeks before the sale was to begin, Mr. Jackson sued to prevent it, saying that he had never been given an opportunity to review the contents. In a settlement, the auctioneer, Julien’s Auctions of Los Angeles, returned all of the property to him.

Another big question left by his death is his deal with AEG Live, the big concert promoter behind the London shows. The company invested at least $20 million to produce the concerts and might have to refund more than $80 million in tickets, according to industry estimates. Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live, said in a telephone interview on Friday that that the concerts were insured, but that the company needed to wait for the coroner’s report before filing a claim.

“Over the weekend we’re all going to be working late trying to figure out what the basis of our insurance claim might be,” Mr. Phillips said. “It’s very, very critical for us that we get the toxicology report from the coroner so we know what the cause of death is.”

Perversely, the fortunes of Mr. Jackson’s estate could benefit from his death. First, there will undoubtedly be an influx of revenue from music sales after the entertainer’s death. Together, the sales from his own recordings, plus income from Sony/ATV and his own catalog would be worth $30 million a year, according to one of his business associates. And the amounts he spent on his lifestyle would be gone.

The winners in all of this could be his family.

“I’m of the view that Michael’s passing, as untimely as it is, is the one opportunity his family and his children have to preserve his asset legacy,” said Charles Koppelman, who is chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and a former music industry executive who several years ago was a financial adviser to Mr. Jackson. “They will earn a tremendous amount of money over the next 12 to 18 months given the outpouring, and he won’t be spending.”

Bill Werde, the editorial director of Billboard, compared Mr. Jackson with Elvis Presley as a star whose very likeness would remain a valuable asset for decades to come.

“If this estate finds smart management, his image and likeness is going to be very easy to exploit,” he said. “There’s a fan base that is hungry for seemingly as much Michael as they can ever get.”

Just how much the outside world learns about the details of Mr. Jackson’s finances may well turn on whether he set up a trust intended to distribute his assets privately, limiting the role of a court. If there is not enough money left behind to satisfy his creditors, the ensuing battle could make the details public, according to lawyers interviewed on Friday.

“If there’s going to be litigation by creditors against these assets, that’s what would happen,” said Andrew S. Garb, a lawyer at Loeb & Loeb in Santa Monica, Calif. Creditors could essentially demand an accounting of the assets left in the trust by Mr. Jackson to satisfy claims, he said.

If instead Mr. Jackson relied on a will, and advisers think there are at least two, then personal financial information would be revealed through probate proceedings. (In the case of multiple wills, generally the most recent valid document prevails.)

Regardless of how Mr. Jackson structured his financial affairs, someone could try to challenge the validity of the documents. For example, someone might argue that he signed a document under duress or that he did not understand the import of signing.

“If, for example, he left everything to some unrelated person and did not provide for his children, that may be another basis to indicate he didn’t know what he was doing,” said Lawrence Heller, a partner in the Los Angeles office of the law firm Bryan Cave.

Mr. Koppelman says he believes the delays, even with the costs of litigation, could ultimately benefit the estate. “I think it’s going to be so confusing that they’ll be able to pile up a lot of money. There’s a real opportunity to save his financial empire.”

“He was a fantastic visionary on the business front,” Mr. Koppelman added. “He just couldn’t deal with his personal finances.”
895 2009-06-27 The championship, where about 450 fighters will meet in Richmond, Va., will be his first competition since retiring. He will raise more than $40,000 just for stepping in the ring, and more than $120,000 if he wins his three fights. He has set up a foundation to handle the money.

Mr. Da Costa was born on Jeta, an island in the Bissagos archipelago off the coast of Guinea-Bissau in West Africa, but moved with his family to Portugal when he was 12.

“The place was called Marianas, near Lisbon,” he said. “It was very tough. When it used to rain, I had to move my bed so it wouldn’t get wet. I had to fight and defend myself every day. That is why I think what people need in life is comfort and warmth. And that’s what I was looking for in my gym.”

One of those sponsoring Mr. Da Costa in the tournament is Jennifer Cacioppo, 38, a homemaker. “I would do anything in the world for Adelino,” she said.

She started training with him just after he arrived in 2002. “He could barely speak English,” she said. “But I could just tell that he was so nice and sincere but also focused and driven.” Mr. Da Costa eventually learned English by renting subtitled movies.

To prepare for the tournament, he decided that at 5 foot 9, he should compete in the lightweight category. That meant dropping to 140.5 pounds from 162 in five weeks.

A typical day in his training has started before 5 a.m. with a breakfast of three dates and water at home in Palisades Park, N.J., and then an hour’s run around Central Park. He has gone to work as usual, with clients at Punch, but at 1 p.m. he has gone to his old boxing gym, Ardon Sweet Science, in the Sunset Park neighborhood in Brooklyn, for intensive training.

Lunch has been a small portion of tuna or chicken and salad. He has returned to Punch to train more clients and end the day with another one-hour run in Central Park. Dinner has been the same as lunch, but on Fridays, he has fasted all day.

He plans to return to Guinea-Bissau for the first time to set the school building in progress. That trip will come soon after the country, torn by two recent political murders, goes to the polls on Sunday. “Building the school is a big motivation by itself when the country is in trouble like this,” Mr. Da Costa said.

On Wednesday, he climbed into a ring at Punch to practice with Aquilino Delgado, 28, a muscular trainer there. At first Mr. Da Costa barely threw a punch or a kick, content to block. But when an alarm beeped to signal the second round, he shed all traces of his smile, rolled up his sleeves and started throwing and landing punches.

Afterward, when Mr. Delgado was asked to name Mr. Da Costa’s greatest strength as a fighter, he said, “He has a heart like a lion, and that will always carry him through.”

Mr. Da Costa, across the ring, did not notice the compliment. He was talking with a client as he covered his tattoos once more.

Mr. Da Costa made his weight and when he stepped on to the floor of the arena, he "felt ready," he said by phone from the tournament. He received a bye in his first fight when his opponent dropped out. He moved directly to the semifinals.

"I felt very good even after seven years away," said Mr. Da Costa. "I controlled the fight and didn't get hurt." The bout went for all three permitted rounds without a knockout and the three judges convened. "When I went back to my corner everyone was confident and telling me I'd won. But they gave it to the other fighter in a split decision."

He has raised more than $80,000 for the school-building project. "I feel like a winner anyway," he said. "And I am ready to do it again and I'm not going to wait that long. This cause has got me back inside the ring again, back where I belong."
896 2009-06-27 The Cleveland Museum of Art will open the first of three new wings designed by the architect Rafael Viñoly on Saturday, uniting two historically important buildings and creating new exhibition space. The 139,200-square-foot East Wing connects the museum’s original 1916 Beaux-Arts buildings, designed by Hubbell and Benes and a 1971 addition designed by Marcel Breuer. The museum’s collections of photography, modern and contemporary art, and 19th-century European sculpture, decorative arts and painting will be open to the public for the first time since 2005. When the renovation is completed in 2012, with two more new wings, an additional 200,000 square feet will have been added. The new space will include a 39,000-square-foot glass-enclosed atrium at the center of the complex, a new lifelong learning center, state-of-the art conservation studios and additional space for the Ingalls Library.
897 2009-06-27 The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, which was teetering on the brink of financial collapse last year before being rescued by Eli Broad, announced on Friday that it had raised $20 million in new funds from trustees and other patrons since the beginning of the year. The fund-raising marks a significant financial turnaround for the museum, whose endowment had shrunk to about $6 million last December from more than $40 million near the beginning of the decade. Since then the museum has cut its staff and trimmed planned exhibitions. The trustees allocated $4.25 million of the recent gifts to the endowment, an amount that was matched by the Broad Foundation to more than double the endowment. The museum also said that three new trustees had joined its board, including Darren Star, the creator “Sex and the City”; Marc I. Stern, an investment company executive and chairman of the Los Angeles Opera; and Carolyn Clark Powers, an arts patron in Los Angeles and Aspen, Colo.
898 2009-06-27 HONG KONG — Qantas Airways of Australia said Friday that it would withdraw or defer orders for 30 of Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

Besides dealing a blow to the manufacturer, the move highlights the intense pressure for cost savings at airlines worldwide as the industry struggles to adjust to a sharp drop in passengers and freight.

Qantas, still the largest customer of the long-range, wide-body Dreamliner aircraft that is considered crucial to Boeing’s future, is canceling orders for 15 of the 787s in a move that it said would save the airline $3 billion. It is delaying delivery of 15 others by four years.

Alan Joyce, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement that the decision was not linked to news Tuesday that the Boeing 787’s first flight had been delayed to allow additional minor modifications to what has been called the world’s most sophisticated plane.

Those problems were the latest in a series of delays in the Dreamliner project and set off concerns about the possible effect on initial delivery schedules. The first delivery, to All Nippon Airways, is scheduled for the first quarter of 2010.
899 2009-06-27 There have been bad housing markets before, but never in post-World War II history has the market for new homes suffered as badly as it has in this decline.

That plunge raises questions about whether some homes built during the boom will ever be sold. It could also suggest that home builders have been slow to cut their prices enough to keep up with falling market prices.

For more than three decades, the sales volume of existing single-family homes and newly built houses tended to rise and fall by about the same percentage, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. To be sure, sales of new homes did tend to do a little worse during recessions, but the difference was small and short-lived.

The top chart shows sales volumes of both types of homes, compared with the sales pace for each in 1976. To avoid monthly gyrations caused by weather or other temporary factors, the figures use three-month moving averages of seasonally adjusted annual rates.

At the peak of the housing boom in 2005, sales of both existing and new homes were running at twice the 1976 rate. This year, the sales rate for existing homes seems to have stabilized at about one-third higher than the 1976 rate. New-home sales also seem to have stabilized, but at about half the 1976 rate.
900 2009-06-27 UBS was hit hard by bad investments linked to the American mortgage market. Credit Suisse, its domestic rival, has also had losses, but it has avoided a government bailout and has arranged a recapitalization through other sources.

Last week, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss banking regulator Finma said that UBS needed to bolster its capital.

UBS said in a statement on Friday that it offered about 293 million newly issued shares to a small number of institutional investors at 13 francs a share.

In October, the government injected six billion francs into UBS in exchange for convertible notes that could give it an 8.5 percent stake in the bank. The government has said it wants to sell its stake as soon as possible after UBS is back on solid ground.

Swiss regulators are also considering taking on new emergency powers that would allow them to break up large banks to wind down troubled business units that were not essential to the functioning of the economy.

“We welcome the capital increase,” Tobias Brütsch, an analyst at the Swiss private bank Vontobel, said in a research note. “UBS had to enhance its capital base after U.S. banks’ capital hikes.”

UBS announced the share offering after saying it expected to post a loss for its second quarter.

Mr. Brütsch said the second-quarter loss was expected because of impairment charges on leveraged financial instruments and a restructuring charge related to the investment banking unit.

For the first quarter, UBS lost 1.98 billion Swiss francs, or $1.75 billion. The bank is also cutting 8,700 jobs through 2010, about 11 percent of its work force. Its chief executive, Oswald J. Grübel, has replaced executive board members and sold its Brazilian business since being appointed in February.

Meanwhile, in its 2008 annual report, the French regulator said the aggregate net income of the country’s eight largest banking groups — Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Caisse d’Epargne, Banque Populaire, Crédit Mutuel-CIC, HSBC France and Dexia Credit Local — was 3.6 billion euros, or about $5 billion, down 83 percent from 2007.

The lower earnings, the report said, were a result of continued write-downs and value adjustments related to soured assets, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, a weak performance from corporate and investment banking and asset management operations and a rise in corporate failures.

In London, the Bank of England’s semiannual Financial Stability Report stressed that further economic shocks remained possible.

“Balance sheets of banks internationally remain weak,” it said in the report, adding that “bank leverage remains high, so net worth is sensitive to changes in sentiment about asset values.”

902 2009-06-28 Scholars are clear that this new edition should not be regarded as definitive any more than the 1964 version. “This book can’t become a sacred text,” said Ann Douglas, a professor of literature at , adding that “there can be no final text because there is not one.”

Indeed, scholars and aficionados have long known that Hemingway did not consider his Paris memoir complete at the time of his in 1961. He wrote a letter — though it was not sent until after his death — to his publisher, Charles Scribner, that “it is not to be published the way it is and it has no end.”

But in an essay she wrote for The New York Times Book Review in May 1964, Mary said Hemingway “must have considered the book finished.” Along with Harry Brague, an editor at Scribner, she shaped the manuscript, changing the order of some chapters, and adding others that Hemingway had decided not to include. Most notably, Mary inserted that final chapter about the end of Hemingway’s first marriage.

In fragments of drafts for an introduction that Hemingway never finished — and now published in the new edition — he wrote that he wanted to save some of that material “for the start of another book,” one that would chronicle the “unbelievable happiness” he had with Pauline.

Hemingway committed suicide before he could write that book. Seán, an associate curator at the who had previously edited anthologies of Hemingway’s writings on war and hunting, worked with manuscripts now housed in the in . His new edition, which will be in bookstores as early as this week, is made up of the 19 chapters that Hemingway wanted to include, in the order he had placed them. The remaining 10 chapters are moved into a section called “Additional Paris Sketches.”

Seán said he revised edits that had been made in the first edition, and restored paragraphs that he believed presented his grandmother’s relationship with Hemingway in a more nuanced and truthful way. Seán said that in doing so, he felt he was returning the text closer to the way his grandfather wanted it.

The new version of Pauline’s arrival in Hemingway’s life, titled “The Pilot Fish and the Rich,” and included in the additional Paris sketches, shows Hemingway taking more responsibility for his breakup with Hadley. While the 1964 edition casts him as Pauline’s victim, he shares the blame in the new version.

“For the girl to deceive her friend was a terrible thing, but it was my fault and that this did not repel me,” Hemingway writes in the new edition. “Having become involved in it and being in love I accepted all the blame for it myself and lived with the remorse.”

Patrick Hemingway, Seán’s uncle and a son of Pauline who originally suggested the project to Seán, said he was curious if there had been more material about his mother. “I thought the original edition was just terrible about my mother,” Patrick said by phone from his home in Bozeman, Mont. He was pleased to see that the new edition reminds readers that his father was happy with Pauline. “He’s more human and less self-justifying,” Patrick said.

Patrick, 81, said he did not blame Mary, who died in 1986, for her editing. “I think she did an excellent job, given the circumstances of the time,” he said. But he speculated that Mary, who had had a falling out with Pauline, might have wanted to curry favor with Hadley, who owned the rights to a painting by Miró that Mary wanted. (Hemingway had one other wife, his third, Martha Gellhorn.)

Sandra Spanier, a professor of English at and the general editor of coming volumes of Hemingway’s letters for Cambridge University Press, said she believed the new edition would present a truer picture of Hemingway. “He had a tremendously active conscience, and he was tremendously honest with himself,” said Ms. Spanier.

Scribner is printing 16,000 copies of the new edition and using its release to re-issue all of Hemingway’s novels with new covers.

Hemingway scholars point out that the author himself often revised memories from earlier letters and notebooks. Jacqueline Tournier-Courbin, author of “Ernest Hemingway’s ‘A Moveable Feast’: The Making of Myth,” said Hemingway “really re-edits the past.”

The new volume includes unpublished material, like accounts of a conversation with Hemingway’s friend, the poet Evan Shipman, and of time he spent with his son Jack in the cafes of Paris.

Some scholars who welcomed the opportunity to look at the new material expressed ambivalence about whether it would improve the literary quality of the book.

“On the one hand you want to know everything he thought whether he wanted it published or not,” said Ms. Douglas. “But gosh, the ’64 edition was a great book already.”
903 2009-06-28 The plodding and rain-soaked United States Open this month was a fitting metaphor for the golf course industry as a whole. Over the last nine years, this highly competitive and mature industry has operated at an overall loss, the research firm IbisWorld reports.

Now add a recession to the mix. That means less revenue from things like membership fees, greens fees and events catering. “Positive revenue growth achieved over 2004 to 2007 will be canceled out by declines in 2008 and 2009,” IbisWorld says.

Nearly 39 percent of golf courses are public, while 34 percent are private and 27 percent are part of a country club, IbisWorld says.

All is not lost for these golf courses. Golf will always have devotees, and even obsessives. Its ability to help close a business deal and cement a friendship remains strong.

Then there is the demographic factor. “The number of golfing participants will grow steadily, supported by the gradual retirement of the baby boomers who will find time on their hands,” IbisWorld asserts.

And in the shorter term, a big dose of sun at the next Open wouldn’t hurt, either. PHYLLIS KORKKI
904 2009-06-28 “America is changing more quickly than the government,” said Linda Ketner, a gay Democrat from South Carolina who came within four percentage points of winning a Congressional seat in November. “They are lagging behind the crowd. But if I remember my poli sci from college, isn’t that the way it always works?”

Some elected Democrats in Washington remain wary because they remember how conservatives used same-sex marriage and gay service in the military against them as political issues. The Obama White House in particular is reluctant to embrace gay rights issues now, officials there say, because they do not want to provide social conservatives a rallying cry while the president is trying to assemble legislative coalitions on health care and other initiatives.

Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a group that opposes gay rights initiatives, said Mr. Obama’s reluctance to push more assertively for gay rights reflected public opinion.

“He’s given them a few minor concessions; they’re asking for more, such as ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ being repealed,” Mr. Perkins said. “The administration is not willing to go there, and I think there’s a reason for that, and that is because I think the American public isn’t there.”

Conservative Democrats have at best been unenthusiastic about efforts to push gay rights measures in Congress; 30 Democrats voted against a bill prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation that passed the House in 2007. (It died in the Senate.) And a half-dozen Democrats declined requests to discuss this issue, reflecting what aides called the complicated politics surrounding it.

Still, there are signs that the issue is not as pressing or toxic as it once was. “I don’t think it’s the political deal-breaker it once was,” said Dave Saunders, a southern Democratic consultant who has advised Democrats running for office in conservative rural areas. “Most people out here really don’t care because everybody has gay friends.”

Interviews with gay leaders suggest a consensus that there has been nothing short of a cultural transformation in the space of just a few years, even if it is reflected more in the evolving culture of the country than in the body of its laws.

“The diminution of the homophobia has been as important a phenomena as anything we’ve seen in the last 15 years,” said Representative , Democrat of , who is gay.

Democrats now control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since 1994, increasing the chances of legislative action. Mr. Frank said that over the next two years, he expected Congress to overturn the ban on gay service in the military, pass legislation prohibiting discrimination against hiring gay workers, and extend the hate-crime bill to crimes involving gay couples.

There is also an emerging generational divide on gay issues — younger Americans tend to have more liberal positions — that has fueled what pollsters said was a measurable liberalization in views on gay rights over the past decade.

A New York Times/CBS News poll last spring found that 57 percent of people under 40 said they supported same-sex marriage, compared with 31 percent of respondents over 40. Andy Kohut, the president of the , said the generational shift was reflected in his polling, in which the number of Americans opposing gay people serving openly in the military had dropped to 32 percent now from 45 percent in 1994.

, a senior Obama adviser, said, “You look at polling and attitudes among younger people on these issues are startlingly different than older people.”

“As generational change happens,” Mr. Axelrod added, “that’s going to be more and more true.”

In the view of many gay leaders, the shifts in public attitude are a validation of the central political goal set by the dozens of gay liberation groups that sprouted up in cities and on college campuses in the months after the : to have gay men and lesbians who had been living in secret go public as a way of dealing with societal fear and prejudice.

But there is considerable evidence that this is still an issue that stirs political concerns. Gay leaders have increasingly complained about what they call Mr. Obama’s slow pace in fulfilling promises he made during his campaign. Some boycotted a fund-raiser recently to show their distress.

“I have been really surprised how paralyzed they seem around this,” said Richard Socarides, who was an adviser to President on gay issues.

Mr. Hildebrand did not respond to calls and e-mail messages asking about his encounter with Mr. Obama, which he described in a private e-mail forum for gay political leaders. (The meeting was confirmed by senior White House officials.)

Still, David Mixner, a longtime gay leader, said he was struck by how things had changed.

Mr. Mixner said, “in 1992, what we were begging Bill Clinton about — literally — about whether he was going to say the word ‘gay’ in his convention speech. Even say it. We had to threaten a walkout to get it in.”
905 2009-06-28 In other words, the racino does not want the racing part anymore. Just the casino, thanks.

“It has been a ploy all along by these people to keep on getting another thing, another thing,” Mr. Perry said as he stood on the porch watching cars snake into the facility late Friday afternoon. “First they got to be open 24 hours a day on weekends, then they’ll get it all week, then they’ll go for gaming tables, too.”

“It’s a ploy to keep going to get what they’re looking for,” Mr. Perry said, “until they’re finally going to get their full-blown casino. Even my friends who come over tell me they would never live here.”

It remains unclear how the bankruptcy for the Twin River owners, BLB Investors, will shake out, in part because the terms were agreed upon by lenders, led by Merrill Lynch, and the state’s governor, Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican, and in Rhode Island, a casino operator must have a racetrack in order to also have slot machines. Late Friday the State House voted by a veto-proof 61 to 9 on a bill to increase the required number of racing days from 125 to 200 a year. That is the opposite direction from where BLB and Mr. Carcieri wanted things to go; part of the bankruptcy deal hinges on BLB’s ability to eliminate the racetrack.

The measure heads to the Senate this week, where it is expected to pass.

Still, the two branches of government did agree on one thing; the same bill gives Twin River the right to stay open 24-7.

This infuriated many neighbors of Twin River, whose property is lined on all sides with homes on lots of an acre or more.

“It used to be, after the old races, there would be some traffic and then it would be quiet all night,” said Anthony Baglini, a neighbor of Mr. Perry’s who is vice president of the Lincoln Taxpayers Association and who opposed the casino expansion. “The biggest thing is not so much the increased traffic or noise or litter, it’s that we feel a helplessness. We were not listened to.”

A spokeswoman for Twin River, Patti Doyle, said such complaints were isolated and not representative of the views of the broader town of bucolic Lincoln, a 20,000-resident burg 15 miles north of Providence.

Still, Lincoln residents voted against round-the-clock gambling at Twin River in a 2007 nonbinding referendum. And the issue was one reason why Joseph A. Montalbano, the Democratic president of the State Senate who represented Lincoln but advocated strongly for Twin River’s expansion, was unseated in 2008 by a political newcomer, Edward O’Neill, an independent.

Rhode Island is significantly dependent on the 60.08 percent cut it gets from slot machines at Twin River and a smaller racino in Newport. In 2008, that $289 million — $245 million of which came from Twin River — was the third largest source of revenue for Rhode Island, behind income and sales taxes.

BLB, a partnership that includes the Mohegan Sun developer, Kerzner International Ltd., is seeking a voluntary bankruptcy deal after it spent $465 million to buy the facility from Wembly PLC in 2005 and plunged $225 million into the expansion. The deal outlined to the court on Tuesday and agreed to in principle by Merrill Lynch and the Carcieri administration would have the bank reduce the total debt load to $300 million from $589 million and require BLB to find a new operator within 120 days.

Among the companies hoping to operate the racino is Harrah’s Entertainment, based in Las Vegas, which has tried for years to open a casino with table games in Rhode Island. In 2006, voters defeated a constitutional amendment to legalize table games and allow for casinos without racetracks. But Jan Laverty Jones, a Harrah’s senior vice president, said the state might be motivated now to give the company a shot because Massachusetts was on the brink of legalizing casinos.

Ms. Jones said Harrah’s would happily protect the greyhound operations and forgo table games to enter the market. BLB is now required to pay $9 million a year to the Rhode Island Greyhound Owners Association, a subsidy without which the racing would most likely cease as the racetrack only made $1.8 million from the races last year. State lawmakers want to save the dog-racing business, which employs about 225 people.

The Harrah’s offer may sound good to lawmakers and owners of racing dogs, but to people like Mr. Perry and Mr. Baglini, it is a sure sign Twin River will only be getting larger, noisier and brighter.

“I am considering moving,” said Mr. Baglini, a 20-year resident. “Lincoln is no longer the Lincoln it was. This was rural country with historic homes. It is being irreversibly changed.”
906 2009-06-28 WASHINGTON  As Democrats strained to win over crucial holdouts on the way to narrow, party-line approval of global warming legislation, they were dogged by a critical question: Has the political climate changed since 1993?

Veteran members of both parties vividly remember when many House Democrats, in the early months of the Clinton administration, reluctantly backed a proposed B.T.U. tax  a new levy on each unit of energy consumed  only to see it ignored by the Senate and seized as a campaign issue by Republicans, who took control of the House the next year.

“A lot of Democrat members got burnt on that vote,” warned Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, who called the climate change measure the defining vote of this, the 111th, Congress.

In a Congress likely to consider a health care overhaul, new ways to govern the financial sector and immigration changes after already approving a $787 billion economic stimulus, there is serious competition for the title of defining vote.

But the climate change measure, a high priority of President Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will no doubt be right at the top of the list. Interest groups on both sides of the issue promise to hinge their support on how lawmakers vote on the bill and actively oppose those who go the other way.

The moment the House approved the bill, Mr. Obama took the opportunity to start increasing pressure on the Senate, where the legislation again faces tough opposition. He had already recorded and distributed the text of his weekly Saturday address, on the urgency of doing something about health care this year. But he pulled it back and substituted a message focusing on the climate victory.

“I want to congratulate the House for passing this bill,” he said, “and I want to urge the Senate to take this opportunity to come together and meet our obligations  to our constituents, to our children, to God’s creation and to future generations.”

Leading Democrats say they are more than happy to have the energy bill serve as a signature issue. They say it represents a transformative moment  their party’s effort to take on a genuine threat to the planet. They say voters will appreciate the legislation as an overdue effort to lessen the nation’s dangerous dependence on foreign oil while creating millions of new jobs in the production and distribution of cleaner energy and in energy conservation technology.

“The American people understand that we can no longer sweep big national problems under the rug and that we had to have an energy policy for the 21st century,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

The two parties have dueled for months over the costs and benefits of the measure, and that debate is certain to continue into the midterm elections of November 2010. But it will mainly be a message battle because even if a climate change bill is passed and signed into law this year as Congressional Democrats and the White House hope, the practical effects will not be felt until after the election.

Republicans obviously saw the parallels between the 1993 vote and the one Friday. As the gavel came down on their failed push to derail the bill, Republicans chanted “B.T.U., B.T.U.” and seemed almost in a celebratory mood.

“On the floor, it felt like we won,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a party political strategist. “They put a lot of guys on the line.”

The votes were strikingly similar. In 1993, the legislation containing the Clinton energy tax was adopted on a 219-to-213 vote with 38 Democrats defecting. On Friday, the House bill was approved 219 to 212, with 44 Democrats defecting.

In an indication of the queasiness among some Democrats, House approval came only after a determined campaign to sway wavering lawmakers. It took personal intervention by the president and vice president; members of the cabinet; the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; Ms. Pelosi; and even last-minute agreements were struck on the House floor.

It was a significant victory for both the president and Congressional Democrats, and it came on an issue that many expected could prove tougher than a health care overhaul. But as progress on health care legislation slowed and consumed much of the attention, Democrats were able to ease the climate change legislation forward, almost under the radar.

Top Democrats say they believe the victory on climate change  setting up a tough summer debate in the Senate  can translate to progress on other difficult issues as lawmakers see Democrats can advance even the most problematic measures.

Still, the vote represents a significant risk. As on the economic stimulus and potentially on a health care bill, Republican votes were scarce, creating a clear contrast between the two parties.

And Republicans  who last year made “drill, baby, drill” their slogan for more, not less, production of the fossil fuels that generate heat-trapping gases along with power, and scored some political gains before the price of oil and gasoline plunged from historic peaks  believe that energy is an issue where they have shown the ability to get some traction.

They also intend to pound home the prospect that the legislation could put the United States at a competitive disadvantage and drive more jobs overseas.

But Democrats view the measure as a singular achievement, with Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of its authors, comparing it to a combination of the Apollo Project and the Civil Rights Act.

Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, said that he believed the political impact of the B.T.U. tax had been exaggerated and that he expected no serious fallout over the new measure. Also, many of the most vulnerable Democrats voted against the measure.

“Mark this day, June 26, 2009,” Mr. Hoyer intoned on the floor just before passage of the climate bill.

No doubt both parties already have.
907 2009-06-28 As part of the Wild West theme in Fort Worth, riders will start their run by being released out of rodeo chutes as if they were bulls.

This year’s series started in Mexico City, where 43,000 fans packed the world’s largest bullring, Monumental Plaza de Toros, and saw 17-year-old New Zealander Levi Sherwood win in his debut.

Maddison, who has become famous for his death-defying New Year’s Eve motorcycle jumps in Las Vegas, won the second stop at the Calgary Stampede.

“For us as riders, we kind of need a pretty big floor space, and that’s what the bullrings and the stockyards have to offer,” Maddison said. “They have plenty of room for us to ride around. One thing Red Bull does is they really build good courses. Every time you show up you’ve got kind of like the leading edge in course design right there.

“The stockyards and the bullrings and stuff also add a different level of entertainment. Especially the bullrings. You’ve got the crowd sitting right on top of you, which is awesome. The crowd really gets to experience it, and live it and breathe it as firsthand as they can.”

After Fort Worth, the series heads to Madrid’s Las Ventas bullring on July 16-17, before finishing in front of the white chimneys of London’s Battersea Power Station on Aug. 22.

One of the stops last year was in a German quarry, “which was a different element, but it was really cool,” Maddison said. “They went down into the depths of a really old quarry, and the center of the quarry was really, really low and they transformed that place into an amazing, amazing thing. Because the quarry had been mined at all different levels, the crowd had bleachers set up on all different levels of the quarry. It was pretty spectacular.”

Maddison said the competition is on par with the X Games, maybe even a little higher level.

““It’s more of a broad kind of an around-the-world group,” he said. “It brings new life to the sport. Like the French guys are doing front flips on their motorcycles. The level of competition is really high at X-Fighters.”

Maddison is not enamored with the X-Fighters’ head-to-head competition format, but he likes the event over all.

“It’s definitely an adrenaline rush,” he said. “Just to compete at the top level and put together a run for two minutes in a final that’s absolutely impeccable, it’s hard to do that,” Maddison said. “It takes a lot of training, and to be perfect and be recognized as the best guy in the world is what everyone’s looking for.”

Maddison, 27, pulled off his most spectacular stunt yet on New Year’s Eve when he jumped his bike up 120 feet and landed atop a 96-foot high scale version of the Arc de Triomphe at Paris Las Vegas. He then dropped 50 feet onto a landing ramp and stayed on his bike, although he hit his hand hard, causing a bloody laceration.

A year earlier, he broke the Guinness world record with a jump of 322 feet, 7.5 inches, also in Las Vegas. Both jumps were part of a Red Bull series.

Maddison is riding high these days. His New Year’s Eve successes and a stable of sponsors allowed him to stop living out of a suitcase and settle in Temecula, Calif., north of San Diego. He has a house with a few jumps in his backyard and is on the Metal Mulisha’s international team.

Being part of the Red Bull X-Fighters has helped him attain his lofty status.

“Man, I love it,” he said. “I’ve been doing this now for four years and just got my first win last month. It’s been a long road to get to the top.”
908 2009-06-28 A new service offered by Aardvark (vark.com), however, provides specific recommendations. Its advice is always current, too, obtained on the fly from those we trust, like friends, but whose collective expertise far exceeds that of the relatively few people we happen to know personally.

Founded in 2007 and based in San Francisco, the company has just completed beta testing of its answer service and opened it to the public last week. It begins with the social network that you’ve established elsewhere. Presently, it requires Facebook; other networks will be added, it says.

Once signed up, you submit a question to Aardvark via an instant message or e-mail, and its software looks among your Facebook friends, and friends-of-your-friends, for volunteers to answer it. You can exclude any friends from the potential contact list.

One doesn’t need Aardvark’s help to blast out a plea for guidance to many people online. But when you do, “you waste the time of a lot of people,” said Damon Horowitz, one of Aardvark’s four co-founders.

Asking a specific person for help isn’t without cost, either. “There’s also ‘social capital’ expended when you lean on a person to answer a question,” Mr. Horowitz said. By having Aardvark circulate the question without letting the questioner know who has declined to respond, no feelings are hurt.

“Aardvark takes that hit,” he said.

Those friends-of-friends may turn out to be a great fountain of hitherto untapped information. For example, none of your 200 Facebook “friends” may have recently stayed in Napa and be able to recommend a bed-and-breakfast. But if each of their friends can be tapped, the pool of prospective wine-country authorities jumps from 200 into the tens of thousands.

You wouldn’t want to bother those thousands, however, with your question about Napa B.& B.’s. Aardvark has devised ways to drastically narrow the search, asking only those who are most likely to have an answer, and asking only a few of them at a time, protecting your network of volunteers from being asked too often.

The Aardvark system assumes that no single answer will serve for everyone who poses the same question. It uses information about interests supplied by registrants and from outside social networking profiles to match interests, demographic characteristics, common affiliations and other factors. It also checks whether prospective advice-givers are presently signed into one of three instant-messaging services. (The company says an iPhone version is in the works, too.)

If no one is interested in answering, Aardvark sends the question along to another small batch, extending from friends to friends-of-friends, and then their friends, if necessary. If the best matches aren’t online, e-mail messages are sent.

“On average, we have to contact eight people to get two who are willing and online,” said Nicholas Chim, a senior engineer at Aardvark. “But we look at thousands in order to build the list of the top prospects.”

Having humans, not software, supply the advice is important. Max Ventilla, who formerly was at Google and is now Aardvark’s chief executive, said, “Often the most useful answers don’t answer the original question. Example: ‘You don’t want to go to the Caribbean now — it’s the rainy season — you want to go to Hawaii.’ ”

ONCE you try Aardvark’s service, you can’t look at Yahoo Answers, the current leader in questions-and-answers, without feeling pity for its now-manifest limitations.

Ask Aardvark the “best Chinese in Palo Alto” question, and two good restaurant names arrive within five minutes, fulfilling the service’s aim of supplying answers from two people — quickly, though not instantly. Follow-up questions can be dispatched effortlessly to the answerers, and one can also click to learn about their interests, group identities, Facebook profiles and personal Web sites, too.

Ask Yahoo Answers the same Palo Alto question and it instantly displays a stored answer with two recommendations, but it was posted four years ago. (A Yahoo spokesman said that no team member was available for an interview.)

Aardvark may come to be preferred over answer databases and “decision engines” if many people want a speedy answer from a fellow human being.

Nathan Stoll, another co-founder, says that there is a common desire for an answer “from someone, but not from anyone — from a friend, or a friend-of-a-friend — from ‘your’ someone.”
909 2009-06-28 Above the Indus River, the highway clung to the cliffs and I could only imagine what lay over the hilltops. At one checkpoint, I sank lower into my seat as police officers with guns and torches peered through the window. Driving through the half-light, I glanced down at my green-glowing BlackBerry, and read a New York Times news alert: “Officials say a huge bomb has exploded at the Pearl Continental Hotel in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, killing at least five people and wounding 25 others.” That would be about 60 miles away.

After two days I felt safer in the zone I had sought — the high mountains where I joined climbers spilling from guesthouses and jeeps and beginning the hike east toward the valley of the Baltoro glacier and the terrifying mountains of the inner Karakoram range.

At Askole, a village of basic wooden homes where children played shoeless in the dirt, we hired eager Balti porters who jostled for our business and streamed by on the hot, dusty paths beside waters churning down from the glacier. The porters bent under our rucksacks and tents, heavy blue food barrels, paraffin stoves, kitchen chairs and tables, as they ushered chickens, goats, yaks and donkeys onto the trail.

In contrast to the porters’ cast-off clothes and sandals, these mountaineers wore expensive high-tech walking gear. A 39-year-old engineer from Germany, Dirk Grunert, obsessively drank liters of boiled water daily to cope with the altitude. A fit couple from Portugal maintained via satellite phone a Web site of their adventures. There were also three Polish mountaineers, including a loud man named Jacek Teler, on his sixth trip in the Karakoram, who conferred with the porters in broken Urdu, performed kung-fu exercises in the mess tent, and was clearly seeking a chance to live a role distant from reality as most of us know it.

They all had stories of near-death experiences in these mountains. Dirk turned back in deep snow near the top of Nanga Parbat. Another year, he was pinned for three nights by a whiteout just below the summit of Broad Peak and, yet another time, was narrowly missed by falling ice. Paulo Roxo, one of the Portuguese, related tumbling dangerously when his rope once failed. “I never can say why I climb, though danger is part of it and the unplanned nature of it,” he said.

Everyone had a close friend who had died. I had come as a mere observer, intending only to trek to K2 base camp and no higher. Listening to the real climbers I could only reflect on the scale of their ambition to tempt fate and return to the perils, again and again.

Soon enough, though, I could marvel at their compensation for the dangers: the awe-inspiring reward of attaining altitude as our campsites among gentle poplars and willows gave way to the cold wasteland of the upper Baltoro glacier and, at last, on one blue clear morning, views of a parade of leviathan peaks: Trango Towers. The shining face of Gasherbrum IV. Broad Peak.

At night, as we slept in our clothes in our tents on the ice and rocks, Nature reminded us of its power. Water bottles froze. The glacier cracked loudly and eerily, sounding like gunshots, as it shifted beneath us.

Finally, after eight days of trekking and wheezing, my lungs feeling emptied of oxygen in the rarefied air, I sprang across a crevasse to reach K2 base camp at 16,000 feet. I had my first view up close of the mountain’s thick brown haunches rising into clouds.

The base camp itself was a long stretch of rocks that snaked for a mile around the bottom of the peak. It was stark — but not, it turned out, as isolated as I had expected from the political problems plaguing Pakistan below. Last year, I was told, the camp was covered with the tents of more than 20 expeditions. This year, in addition to us, there were only two parties — five people from Switzerland, and an Italian and Swedish pair who were planning to ski from the summit; a mere handful more were expected in the coming weeks.

Even the death-defiers of the mountains had felt daunted by the need to pass through the human violence below. The mountain’s perils were something they felt they knew. War was something else.

At K2, sitting on a mat in my kitchen tent, I spoke to a member of the Swiss expedition, Olivier Roduit, 43, a mountain guide for 20 years who had a young son back home. He had considered traveling from India in order to bypass Swat, but decided instead to fly directly from Islamabad to northern Pakistan. He said the reduced numbers were due to the political situation — and not the effect of last year’s disaster on K2, one of the worst in mountaineering history, in which 11 people were killed. “After the accident it is crazy, but it is actually good advertising” among climbers for the mountain, he told me. “I have many friends who have died. In Peru, the Alps, the Himalayas.”

The next day, as we began our descent, there was one more surprise. A few hundred feet down, my 30-year-old traveling companion and photographer, Andrew Ensslen, an architect from London, collapsed; the problems were exhaustion and serious altitude sickness. Other climbers urged us to lose altitude quickly, but he could hardly walk. Even at base camp level, it turned out, the mountain could have proved fatal for us. I called for rescue on my satellite phone and four hours later two green military helicopters dropped out of the sky. We were taken away, swaying down the vast and frightening and wonderful Himalayan canyons, leaving our porters below, saved even from the task of trekking out from K2 to safety.

Two days later, at the airport in Britain, my friend was recovering from his illness, and I could only reflect on the intensity of the experience.

One part of me remembered the words of Dirk Grunert, who had tried to explain the life-changing qualities of climbing: “On the mountain there is the focus, the total absorption of mountaineering,” he said. “Then the return, the coming back is the best.” In a way, I felt cheated; my return had been cut short.

But there was also the angry immigration official who greeted me in Britain with an upbraiding — not for approaching the mountain, but for braving the war zone below. “Graham,” the official said, “you don’t know how lucky you were.”
910 2009-06-28 The Fever was also averaging a league-leading 11 steals.

“I am really proud of our team,” said guard Katie Douglas, who scored all of her 28 points Friday in the second half. “Our chemistry is really good with this group, since we were together last year also. And our new players coming in have fit our chemistry.”

In Indiana’s win at home last Sunday, 82-70 against Detroit, the Fever rallied from a 17-point third-quarter deficit for its second win in three days against the defending W.N.B.A. champions.

“To get a win up there and then get down by 17 and persevere and come back, last year we would not have been able to do that,” Douglas said.

Indiana finished 17-17 last season after reaching 21 wins in each of the previous three years.

PEP TALK HELPS SCORING After averaging 4 points in the first four games, Belinda Snell had a career-high 21 for the San Antonio Silver Stars in a 91-87 victory against the Phoenix Mercury on Tuesday night.

Silver Stars Coach Dan Hughes sensed Snell was pressing too much while trying to fit in with the team, so he gave her a pep talk in the airport Monday while waiting for a return flight to San Antonio after losses to the Liberty and to Connecticut.

“When we sat there and talked,” Hughes said, “I said: You just need to relax a little bit, and know we believe you’re a playmaker. Just try to get close to what you do well.

“I think she’s been concentrating so much to learn our system, and I know our system isn’t easy.”

“Previous games, I’ve been a bit tense, worrying about every little thing I did out there,” she said, added that she was more relaxed Tuesday.

Snell’s big night off the bench gave San Antonio four players in double figures, along with the starters Becky Hammon (19 points), Ruth Riley (16) and Sophia Young (13).

“That’s what we’ve got to move toward,” Hughes said, “when we have that balanced scoring.”

ADJUSTING TO FASTER PACE Kristi Toliver was on the Maryland team that won the N.C.A.A. championship during her freshman season.

Toliver played in the N.C.A.A. tournament all four years, reaching the Final Four again as a senior earlier this year. She averaged 14.9 points and 5.4 assists in her career for the Terrapins, and was selected No. 3 over all by Chicago in the W.N.B.A. draft in April.

So how is the adjustment to the pros going?

“I think that the length, the speed and the athleticism of the league has been the biggest adjustment,” said Toliver, who was averaging 7.3 points and 2.4 assists in 12.1 minutes entering the weekend. “It’s the best of the best playing night in and night out. It’s great to play against that kind of competition.”

BEST PLAYERS IN WEEK 2 Washington’s Alana Beard and Seattle’s Lauren Jackson were selected as the league’s players of the week for the Eastern and Western Conferences for the second week of the season.

Jackson earned the honor for the 14th time, trailing Los Angeles’s Lisa Leslie by one for the most in W.N.B.A. history. A two-time most valuable player, Jackson averaged 25.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.0 blocks in the Storm’s wins against Minnesota and Phoenix.

She had a season-high 26 points and a career-best 6 steals against Minnesota on June 19, and has topped 20 points in every game this season.

Beard was selected for her fourth weekly award after averaging 25.5 points and 4.0 rebounds in the Mystics’ two games. She scored 31 points in a win against Chicago last Saturday, including the tying jumper with 6 minutes 4 seconds left and then a 3-pointer about 40 seconds later that gave Washington the lead for good.
911 2009-06-28 “Bringing him on is part of a consensus,” said Karim Makdessi, a professor of political science at American University in Beirut. “He is coming in with regional agreement, as part of the larger Saudi-Syrian agreement.”

Mr. Hariri was tapped to form the next government after receiving the votes of the 71-member majority coalition and 14 votes from the opposition. There are 128 seats in Parliament.

“According to the Constitution, and after the president consulted with the speaker of Parliament and parliamentarians, he summoned Saad Hariri and tasked him with forming a new government,” said a statement released by President Michel Suleiman.

Mr. Hariri’s selection was set after days of consultation among Lebanon’s various political factions and a private meeting between Mr. Hariri and the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.

Mr. Hariri and his political allies managed to edge out the Hezbollah-led alliance, which is aligned with Iran and Syria, taking a majority of seats in Parliament in the elections earlier this month.

While the campaign was heated, the postelection period has proven conciliatory. Immediately after the election, Mr. Nasrallah said he accepted its results, and Mr. Hariri has since sounded a more tempered note, especially on the matter of Hezbollah’s weapons.

During the campaign, his candidates said they would fight to disarm Hezbollah, a red line for the group, but since then Mr. Hariri has said that the issue will be taken up only in the context of the national dialogue, a continuing formal process.

It was unclear how Mr. Hariri would handle the issue of the tribunal and how far Lebanon might go in helping with prosecutions. Initial reports by the first investigator pointed a finger at Syria, which has denied involvement in the killing.

Mr. Hariri’s cabinet choices as well are expected to be the product of behind-the-scenes negotiating. While he has said his government will include members of the opposition, it was not yet clear if they would have enough cabinet seats to wield veto power.

Lebanese newspapers have reported that the likely outcome would be a cabinet composed of 30 ministers, with 16 for the majority, 10 representing the minority and 4 ministers aligned with the president.

While Mr. Hariri’s appointment may point to stability, Mr. Makdessi, the political scientist, said questions remained about the management of the state. It was likely, he said, that in the short term, Western institutions, like the World Bank, and Western donors, like France and the United States, would try to offer support to the new Hariri government.

“The question is, will the political leaders put in respected technocrat types who can encourage a real policy debate?” he said. “Or is this just posturing, and everybody will go back to distributing services around to their own? I am not optimistic.”
912 2009-06-28 Emily Beth D’Antonio and Michael Benjamin Weitman were married Saturday at the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Rockville Centre, N.Y. The Rev. Jeffrey Laustsen, the church’s pastor, performed the ceremony.

Ms. D’Antonio, 30, is keeping her name. She is studying for a Ph.D. in clinical and school psychology at Hofstra. She graduated from the University of Richmond and received a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Fordham.

She is a daughter of Jocelyn D’Antonio and Daniel D’Antonio of Rockville Centre. Her father is a project manager in the facilities department at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y. Her mother is an assistant professor of nursing at the university’s Brooklyn campus.

Mr. Weitman, 32, is an associate in the litigation department at the New York law firm Seward & Kissel. In August, he is to become a clerk for Theodore H. Katz, a federal magistrate judge in the Southern District of New York. The bridegroom graduated cum laude from Boston University and received a law degree, cum laude, from Brooklyn Law School.

He is the son of Charlotte B. Beyer and Warren P. Weitman Jr., both of New York. His mother is the founder and chief executive of the Institute for Private Investors in New York, which provides investment advice to wealthy families. His father is the chairman for North American and South American operations of Sotheby’s in New York.

The bridegroom is the stepson of Keith Fiveson and Eve Reid.
913 2009-06-28 Consider Westchester County. Roughly 100 of the 573 spaces at the parking lot in Dobbs Ferry were free at 3 p.m. on a recent Tuesday. Over in Hartsdale, Stephanie Kavourias, executive director of the public parking authority, figures that about 90 of the station’s 900 permit spaces are empty on an average day now. And Robert Meehan, the supervisor of the town of Mount Pleasant, which includes Valhalla (191 spaces) and Hawthorne (355), has also seen growth in vacancies.

“I went down to Valhalla on a recent Monday and there were 30 spaces empty,” Mr. Meehan said. “Before the recession it would always be full.”

But these empty spaces may be chimerical. It’s “look but don’t touch” for people like Mr. Blake because many permit holders, even if they have lost their jobs and no longer commute regularly, still hold tightly onto their permits. Jeanette DeLeo, an assistant in the city clerk’s office in Rye, said there has been no whittling of the waiting list in her town, and the reason is not hard to fathom.

“With a waiting list of 8 to 10 years, people will not give up their permits,” Ms. DeLeo said.

Most train stations also have metered daily spaces, but drivers who use them must often carry canvas bags of quarters and recruit someone to feed the meter if they work late. And there is always the danger that a commuter will arrive at the station to find the metered lot full (though the recession has eased this problem somewhat).

All these factors mean that the permit-only lots are crucial for suburban parkers, none more so than those who live in places like Ardsley, which has no train station of its own. Its 4,800 residents must rely on the kindness of strangers — the nearby villages — for parking spaces. Ardsley residents have been allotted 43 spots at the Dobbs Ferry station and 20 in Hartsdale. The rest of the Ardsley commuting population must jury-rig a daily path to the station — a spouse or friend drives them, they take a bus or a cab, they illicitly park on a nearby street and risk a ticket. Many simply drive into the city, greenhouse gases be damned.

Charles Harris, a 71-year-old insurance agent, walks a quarter-mile from his Ardsley home to a bus that takes 10 minutes to get him to the station, and then waits another 20 minutes for the 7:58 to Grand Central Terminal.

Door to door, Mr. Harris said, “it takes me an hour and a half to get 21 miles.”

Jay Leon, the mayor of Ardsley, regularly pleads for more parking spots on behalf of Mr. Harris and his other constituents — and those requests may start to sound a bit more reasonable now that empty spaces are appearing in the Dobbs Ferry lot.

“It’s kind of a joke between me and the mayor of Dobbs Ferry,” Mr. Leon said. “Every six months I start lobbying him for parking spaces. He laughs about it but says not this time, maybe next time.”

Scott Seskin, mayor of Dobbs Ferry, admitted that he, too, has noticed the increase in vacant parking spaces and is having the police do a count. If there is a surplus of spaces, he said, he will ask the village board of trustees to make those spots available to Ardsley residents.

Jim Cameron, chairman of the state-created Connecticut Rail Commuter Council, wants to free up the growing number of vacant commuter parking spots in his state. To do so, he is pressing public officials to allow permit holders who seldom commute to “sublet” their permits. Right now, such transfers are generally forbidden, but Mr. Cameron said that rule makes no sense.

“If I’ve been laid off and am not going into the city every day and I know there are people who have been on a waiting list for four or five years, why don’t I have the right to put a note at the station and say there’s a parking permit for rent?” asked Mr. Cameron. He lives in Darien, Conn., where the waiting list is more than four years.

Layoffs seem the most probable reason for the empty parking spots, but Ms. Kavourias, the parking official in Hartsdale, detects another recession-related cause. Some people who are only sporadic commuters, she said, are forsaking a permit and feeding the daily parking meters instead. With the meters costing $7.50 for a 15-hour day, and a Hartsdale parking permit costing $725 a year, for some irregular commuters the meters may make more sense. “Everybody’s starting to do the math now with the economics being what they are,” Ms. Kavourias said.

Still, in the parking-scarce suburbs, getting a parking tag after years of waiting has traditionally prompted the same elation an immigrant feels on getting a green card. And the efforts involved can be similarly heroic. Until 2007, for example, the affluent, sailboat-lined village of Rowayton, Conn., required parking permit applicants to line up on Father’s Day weekend. Even the town’s millionaire chief executives would start queuing after midnight, and spend the night snoozing in folding chairs or sleeping bags until the stickers went on sale at 8 a.m.

Small wonder that suburbanites often find it striking to see these empty parking spots. Consider Salvatore Arena, a Long Island Rail Road spokesman, who said that parking at his station in Ronkonkoma “has eased significantly since the downturn.”

“Plenty of space these days in a huge lot that used to be real tight,” mused Mr. Arena in an e-mail message. “I’ve often thought there must be a sad story behind every missing car.”

However odd the empty spaces look to suburban eyes, many local officials expect that eventually there will once again be no room at the lot. That is why the Westchester town of Mount Pleasant, despite its current empty spots, is proceeding with its plan to add room for 104 more cars in its parking areas.

“While the recession creates some issues of people not going to work,” said Mr. Meehan, the Mount Pleasant supervisor, “long term the demand for spaces has steadily grown.”

When demand for parking returns to pre-recession levels, that would certainly not be good for Ardsley. Just ask Natalie Werner, a Westchester real estate broker.

“I’m often told by people that they don’t want to live in Ardsley,” Ms. Werner said, and they say that despite the high-performing schools and other attractions of the village. And what reason do they give for this decision? “Because you can’t commute,” she answered.
914 2009-06-28 AT Nisi Estiatorio, the entrancing new Greek restaurant in downtown Englewood, the staff will cheerfully give you a guided tour of the fresh whole fish that gleam on a snowy platform of crushed ice at the center of the dining room.

These days, many upmarket Greek establishments do the whole-fish-on-ice thing. And while the fish are mostly fine (at $25 to $34 a pound, they’d better be), what really gleams at Nisi is everything else. A buoyant but polished enthusiasm pervades every aspect of the experience — the look, the service and especially, I’m happy to report, the rest of the menu.

The chef, John Piliouras, 50, is of Greek ancestry, but his culinary roots spread much wider. After a midlife career change — he was a buyer for Pottery Barn — he cooked in French and New American kitchens in Westchester County, then made his way to Molyvos, perhaps Manhattan’s most renowned Greek restaurant, as chef de cuisine. Nisi’s owners, the brothers Peter and Othon Mourkakos, lured him across the Hudson to open their restaurant in January. (The word nisi is Greek for island; estiatorio means restaurant.)

Mr. Piliouras tends to start out with Greek ingredients and let his imagination roam. Salmon (not a Mediterranean fish, but never mind) is cured for 36 hours in a slurry of brown sugar, sea salt, fennel pollen and ouzo; it takes on a resonant undertone of anise that harmonizes well with the dill, capers and ouzo vinaigrette that garnish this lustrous appetizer.

More elaborate, but just as successful, is an appetizer of sea scallops that could pass for an entree. Two monsters the size of racquetballs are sautéed to translucency, then wrapped in air-dried cured beef called pastourma and coated with crunchy shredded phyllo. Tangy calamata vinegar and mellow lemon beurre blanc round out the picture.
915 2009-06-28 Noa Miriam Yemini and John Paul Arias were married Saturday evening at the Atlantica, an event space in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. Rabbi Renée Feller officiated, and the Rev. Neil O’Connell, a Roman Catholic priest, took part in the ceremony.

Mrs. Arias, 30, is to begin working in August as an assistant marketing manager in New York for the United States unit of L’Oréal Paris. She graduated from Columbia and received an M.B.A. from New York University.

She is the daughter of Shaula A. Yemini of New York and Yechiam Yemini of Alpine, N.J. Her father is a professor of computer science at Columbia. Her parents were the owners of System Management Arts, known as Smarts, a developer of network management software in White Plains; her mother was also the company’s chief executive. The bride is the stepdaughter of Tzippi Hollander-Yemini.

Mr. Arias, also 30, is a systems administrator who manages computer systems at the Tudor Investment Corporation, a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn. He graduated from Fordham and is in his first year of an M.B.A. program at New York University.

He is a son of Carolyn Arias of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Ricardo Arias of Walden, N.Y. His mother retired as a reading teacher at Yonkers Middle/High School and now teaches adult basic education at Vive School in Yonkers. His father retired as a professor of Spanish language and culture at Fordham. The bridegroom is a stepson of Nancy Kerstein-Arias.
916 2009-06-28 Emily Warner Parsons and Roberto Lupo Talamo Atenolfi Brancaccio were married Saturday at St. John’s Episcopal Church on Fishers Island, N.Y. The Rev. Michael E. Spencer, the priest-in-charge of the church, performed the ceremony.

Mrs. Talamo, 27, is the special events manager for the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction in New York, which raises money to pay for surgery for pediatric patients at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Langone Medical Center. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford.

She is a daughter of Suzanne W. Parsons and Robert W. Parsons of Mystic, Conn. Her father is a founder and managing director of Parsons Capital Management, an investment firm in Providence, R.I. Her mother is the board president of the Island Health Project, a nonprofit organization that raises money for a year-round physician on Fishers Island. Her maternal grandfather, Rawleigh Warner Jr. of Jupiter Island, Fla., was the chairman of Mobil Oil from 1969 to 1986.

Mr. Talamo, 32, is an account manager at Valens Capital Management, a New York hedge fund, where he monitors the viability of a portfolio of distressed debt investments. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y. He is a son of Leith Rutherfurd Talamo Atenolfi Brancaccio of New York and Fulvio Eduardo Talamo Atenolfi Brancaccio, marchese di Castel Nuovo, of Porto Ercole, Italy. His mother is a conservator of paintings in New York. His father retired as a consultant with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome. He was primarily involved in improving deep-sea fishing in Arab countries.

The bridegroom is a maternal great-great-grandson of Levi P. Morton, the vice president under President Benjamin Harrison, and governor of New York from 1895 to 1897. The bridegroom is also a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch governor of the colony of New Netherland.
917 2009-06-28 The 1979 introduction of what was supposed to be a world-beating economy hatchback, the Strada, instead turned out to be a swan song: that car was the last Fiat-branded product in the United States. Among the Strada’s myriad faults, Mr. Baker recalls, was an engine compartment that got so hot the electric cooling fan, controlled by a thermostat, would never shut off. It simply stayed on until it drained the battery. Even impressive gas mileage — the E.P.A. highway rating was 38 m.p.g. — would not sustain the troublesome Strada.

Jonathan Stein, an automotive historian who comes from a family of Fiat owners, recalls a particular 1981 Fiat 131 sedan bought after sitting on a dealer’s lot for a year. “The car already had body rust when we bought it,” he said. “Every six months, we had to return it to the dealer to have the rust repaired.”

My mother, Joyce Sass, recalls her 1981 Spider 2000, painted a pretty shade of light blue, as the “bring it on by” car. It earned the name because that was the phrase consistently offered by the service manager of Archway Imports in St. Louis, in response to her latest description of the car’s malfunctions.

Some Fiat owners did get excellent service from their cars. Rich Williams of Santa Barbara, Calif., owned a 1976 124 Spider from 1986 until 2001. “I bought it not because I had any interest in Fiats per se, but simply because I was a poor grad student,” he said. “It was cheap transportation, and the top went down.”

Mr. Williams’s care for his 124 was not exactly that of a doting owner. “I rarely changed the oil, and I bought the cheapest parts for it possible,” he said. “Still, I got about 125,000 miles out of it. It only broke down on me once.

“I did go through numerous convertible tops, though. When they wore out, I just drove to the manufacturer in L.A., bought a top and replaced it myself.”

Mr. Baker said he thought that at the time Fiat left the United States in 1983, the company’s management simply didn’t understand how the American market was evolving. “We kept telling them that quality was becoming the most important attribute to American buyers, and their response was, ‘How good is good enough?’” he said.

Still, Fiats were often a darling of the enthusiast press. In 1967, Road & Track called the Fiat 850 coupe “one of the handsomest, best-balanced designs ever seen on a small car.” And of the 1100R sedan tested the same year, it said, “Despite the car’s first purpose as economy transportation, it can deliver more sheer fun than almost any small sedan on the market.”

Little has changed in this regard. John Montgomery, president of Fiat Lancia Unlimited, a club based in Coldwater, Mich., said vintage Fiat sports cars had a junior-exotic appeal, giving enthusiasts of average means a taste of the Ferrari experience.

In addition to common ownership, Fiat and Ferrari have often shared the services of styling houses like Pininfarina and Bertone, Mr. Montgomery points out. Little surprise, then, that the Fiat 124 Spider bears more than a passing resemblance to the Ferrari 275 GTS, and the wedge profile of the Fiat X 1/9 can be seen in the Ferrari 308 GT/4.

It is curious, then, that the values of vintage Fiats have remained relatively low while prices of vintage Ferraris and even comparable British sports cars from the same era have increased. Both the 124 Spider and X 1/9 were more technologically advanced than their MG and Triumph competitors. The X 1/9 was one of the first inexpensive midengine sports cars, and the 124 Spider had an alloy twin-cam engine, four-wheel disc brakes, a 5-speed transmission and one of the best convertible tops ever.

At the same time, the British made do with 4-speeds, rear drum brakes, cast-iron pushrod engines and leaky convertible tops that seemed to have been engineered by the Marquis de Sade.

Mr. Montgomery, the club president, said that in marketing and service support the British had Fiat beat. “There were simply more MG and Triumph dealers out there, they were better stocked with parts and technicians and they spent more on advertising,” he said, noting that the gap seems to carry over today. “It’s much easier to find someone willing to work on an old MG or Triumph than it is to find an Italian-car mechanic.”

Andy Reid, senior editor of Classic Motorsports magazine, agrees. “Usability factors heavily into collector-car values, and the perception is that Italian cars are just more difficult to live with than British cars,” he said. “Fiats are more complex and far more difficult for the average guy to work on.”

Additionally, Mr. Reid said, there are fewer sources for parts for Fiats than for British cars, and the parts tend to be a bit more expensive.

Values for collectible Fiat sports cars have remained steady for some time, Mr. Reid said, with a nice but not perfect 124 or Spider 2000 available in the $5,000 to $8,000 range and an X 1/9 (produced from 1973-86) at $3,000 to $7,000. A 1200, prized by collectors for its cuteness, recently sold at auction for almost $40,000.

“Rare models like the Fiat Dino Spider, with a Ferrari-engineered V-6, can sell for up to $60,000,” he said.

Recent surveys have shown that Americans expect Fiat quality and reliability to be of little concern, though J. D. Power & Associates studies of customer satisfaction in Europe rank the brand near the bottom of all carmakers.

Even so, many Americans think of Fiat as a global giant with brands like Ferrari, Maserati and Alfa Romeo, as well as control of the new Chrysler Group. They may be familiar with the latest version of the cute 500 minicar, which is likely to be sold eventually through Chrysler dealers. And quite likely, Fiat enthusiasts are hoping that the company’s third time in the United States market will be the charm.
918 2009-06-28 So why not patch things up with her? A friend with a little backbone is nothing to sneeze at.

I was the best man at a wedding more than a year ago. They planned to spend their honeymoon in London, where I live, and I intended to book a night at a five-star hotel as my gift. But they kept postponing the trip, so I never told them. I’m about to see the groom for the first time since the wedding. Is it too late to buy a gift? My mother says that the $1,000 I spent to travel to the wedding is more than enough.

Listen, we all know that weddings can be a chore, especially when we’re on the fringes of the guest list and the ceremony wipes out a sunny three-day weekend.

But you were the best man, dude! That’s as close as you can get without fighting over the flower budget. So either the groom is less popular than Michael Vick at a dog show — and you took the gig out of pity — or you’re tight with the happy couple and owe them a gift.

Ebeneezer Mommy has a point: a grand is a lot to invest in someone else’s wedding. But it doesn’t take five-star frosting to fulfill your obligation — or make you feel less of a heel when you see the groom.

Just write a note explaining the delay and make a substitution. Take them out to dinner or buy something from their registry (most of which they’ve long since realized they’ll never use). A Waterford crystal bell, anyone, with a sterling silver clapper?

My twin brother and his wife have declined every invitation to the meaningful events in my life for 20 years. They have three teenagers, and my husband and I never miss a baptism, birthday or football game. My brother says he loves me, but family comes first; and as we have no children, they don’t feel obliged to participate in our events. Should I continue inviting him? Joyce, Cleveland

Family first?! What are you, twin sister, a half-portion of chopped liver?

Twenty years is a long stretch of not showing up. Is it possible that your brother has an issue with you that he’s sweeping under the carpet — or that he’s using his family as pretext? Teenagers are so expert at giving their parents the slip, he probably can’t find his, much less devote every waking hour to them.

Try a heart-to-heart: “I know you’re busy, brother, but it would mean so much if you came to my anniversary party.” If he still begs off, ask if he has a problem with you or your spouse that he’d like to discuss.

If not, scratch him from your guest list for a spell, and try focusing on the people who show up for you, instead. It may be hard for you. And your brother may come to regret his behavior — or not. But at least your milestones won’t all be marred by pokes in the eye.

A new person joined my yoga class and has a habit of yelling her “Om!” She ignores the soft beginning and jumps in with a deafening wail, which she continues long after the rest of us are finished. Any suggestions?

A Zen yogi would find a way to accept the deafening chant as a lesson in tolerance — which is probably why you came to me instead. So, if the Human Foghorn is really bothering you, ask your yoga teacher to intervene. Or take a deep breath as you sit cross-legged on your mat and repeat after me: “May this be the worst problem I have today.”
919 2009-06-28 IT’S a Hollywood truism that for every movie that sees the light of day, a hundred others languish in the purgatory (or worse) of development. But how many movies owe their very existence to a roster of films that never happened? Such is the case with Michael Mann’s “Public Enemies,” a dual portrait of the bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), the young, ambitious F.B.I. agent who took him down.

The film, which opens Wednesday, is unusual on many fronts. Its Depression-era setting, R rating and dense storytelling make it an anomaly, an Oscar hopeful planted in the middle of a season traditionally more accommodating to the shape-shifting robots of “Transformers” than to J. Edgar Hoover. It refurbishes a genre  the 1930s gangster movie  that studios have left largely unexploited in the two decades since Brian De Palma’s “Untouchables.” And, appropriately, it leaves a trail of cinematic corpses in its wake: two feature films, an HBO mini-series and a prison epic starring Mr. Depp. With its portrayal of two men clenched by obsession and its meticulous visual sheen, “Public Enemies” plays as if it were intended to be a Michael Mann movie all along. But it got there the hard way.

The project began its life, sort of, in the mind of Mr. Mann before he had even embarked on his directorial career, which now runs to 10 movies over 29 years. Mr. Mann, 66, grew up in Chicago, not far from where Dillinger spent his last months hiding out. In the 1970s, he recalled, “my wife and I used to go to art films at the Biograph,” the movie house where Dillinger spent his last night watching the Clark Gable gangster film “Manhattan Melodrama” before F.B.I. agents gunned him down on the street outside. Fascinated by the period, Mr. Mann began work on a screenplay, not about Dillinger but about Alvin Karpis, one of the last of that era’s criminals to be captured.

The Karpis project “got me into the period,” Mr. Mann said, “trying to understand the history, imagining the tough, tough existence of these guys being pressed on both sides by twin evolutionary forces  on the one hand, J. Edgar Hoover inventing the F.B.I., and on the other, organized crime evolving rapidly into a kind of corporate capitalism” that had no room for independent criminals either. But despite several attempts to get the screenplay into filmable shape, Mr. Mann said he was never satisfied enough to proceed. Throughout the ’80s and ’90s, as he directed several films that showcased his strong interest in cops and criminals  “Thief,” “Manhunter,” “Heat”  he began shifting his attention from Karpis to Dillinger, whose clean-cut looks and savvy control of his publicity made him a more movie-friendly subject.

Years later, in 1999, the author and journalist Bryan Burrough (“Barbarians at the Gate”) was at home in Maplewood, N.J., watching a documentary about another set of outlaws from the period, the Ma Barker gang. Intrigued, Mr. Burrough started reading everything he could on the subject and realized that he had found a great story: the astonishing chronological convergence from 1932 to 1934 of a rogue’s gallery comprising Dillinger, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly and the Barkers, just as Hoover was attempting to create America’s first centralized law enforcement system.

Mr. Burrough said he loved the idea of “a joint narrative of the period,” but not as a book. “I had two young sons, 7 and 5 at the time, and I didn’t relish the idea of spending the next five years of my life crisscrossing the Midwest in a rental car with McDonald’s bags piling up.” So he pitched it to Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal’s Tribeca Films, which sold the idea to HBO as a multicharacter eight-hour mini-series, with Mr. Burrough as executive producer and writer.

Mr. Burrough said he quickly figured out that he didn’t “know the first thing about writing screenplays.” Beyond that the F.B.I. case files on those crimes and investigations had now become public in Washington and had made a book (and less travel) possible. By 2000 he had amicably left the HBO project, which continued in development without him, and begun researching a manuscript about the same material. Enter Kevin Misher, the studio executive who in 2001 left his job as president for production at Universal Pictures to become an independent producer.

Like Mr. Burrough and Mr. Mann, Mr. Misher was an aficionado of the era. “The cars are cool, the guns are cool, the girls are beautiful, the guys are dressed” in sharp suits, he said. “It has much more cool factor than just a quaint sepia-toned history.” Eager to revive the genre, Mr. Misher acquired the life rights to Purvis, the agent who, under Hoover’s mentorship, led the pursuit of Dillinger but broke with Hoover soon after Dillinger’s death and, disillusioned, resigned from the F.B.I. in 1935, when he was 31.

While Mr. Misher began work on a Purvis project, Mr. Burrough’s book “Public Enemies” was coming together, and the HBO mini-series was falling apart. HBO returned the rights to be resold by Mr. Burrough’s agents at the Creative Artists Agency, and Mr. Mann and Mr. Misher, now working together, quickly jumped in with an offer. Their plan: to jettison any material that didn’t concern Dillinger or the formation of the F.B.I. and use what remained as what Mr. Misher called a “research bible” for a Dillinger film. In mid-2004 they sold the project to Universal, thanks in some measure to a powerful partner: Appian Way, Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company, which stepped in when Mr. DiCaprio expressed a desire to play Dillinger.

Over the next three years Mr. Mann supervised several drafts of the script written by Ronan Bennett, the Irish novelist (“The Catastrophist”) whose qualifications for the job included time spent in Long Kesh prison as a teenager for an I.R.A. bank robbery. (The conviction was later overturned.) Eventually Mr. Mann and Ann Biderman (the creator of “Southland” on NBC) took over; the final screenplay is credited to all three.

Mr. Burrough assumed the film would never happen. “There are a million different ways for a Hollywood project to die,” he said, “and this had already died once. Then, in December 2007, I get an e-mail from C.A.A. saying not only that the movie had been green-lit, but that it was going to star Johnny Depp. I thought it was a joke.”

It was no joke. The now-or-never mentality under which every studio was operating at the end of 2007 had cost the project Mr. DiCaprio. Production of “Public Enemies”  in fact, of all movies  had to finish by June 30, 2008, before the start of an anticipated Screen Actors Guild strike. With Mr. DiCaprio committed to Martin Scorsese’s “Shutter Island” (opening this fall), Universal turned to Mr. Depp, whose own project, an adaptation of Gregory David Roberts’s novel “Shantaram,” about a robber and heroin addict who escapes from prison, was about to be postponed.

Mr. Bale signed on soon after, fascinated, “not only by Purvis’s pursuit of Dillinger,” he said, “but by his pursuit to achieve the vision of Hoover, and his reaction when Hoover seemed to compromise his vision of how to enforce the law.”

Despite its tortuous history, “Public Enemies” looks, on screen, as if Mr. Mann intended all along to reshape the material as a fresh chapter in his remarkably cohesive body of work. Like “Heat” (1995), which paired Mr. De Niro as a master thief and Al Pacino as a police lieutenant, the new film positions two A-list stars on opposite sides of the law  and like “Heat,” it’s a film in which the two stars barely share a scene. Like “The Insider” (1999), Mr. Mann’s most acclaimed film, “Public Enemies” looks closely at two skilled professionals who each struggle with personal codes of honor. And as in “Manhunter” (1986) Mr. Mann seems enthralled by the subject of a lawman so willing to pursue a criminal that he endangers his sense of himself.

“Honestly, no,” Mr. Mann said, laughing when asked whether the thematic consistencies are deliberate. “From my point of view, which is maybe not other people’s, it isn’t a mano-a-mano movie. What I was taken with was the love affair between Dillinger and Billie Frechette,” his girlfriend, played by the Oscar-winning French actress Marion Cotillard. “They’re symbiotic. He didn’t have a mother and was desperate for love of women. She needed a father. They were preformed for each other.”

His movies are known for many things, from technological virtuosity to narrative complexity, but prominent roles for women are not among his trademarks. The character of Billie is something of an exception. Several American actresses wanted the part; Ms. Cotillard won it even though her English was less than rock steady. “But she’s ferocious,” Mr. Mann said. “She’s so focused and artistically ambitious that you knew that come hell or high water she was going to get there.”

Her character features prominently in a memorable scene, the film’s most overt nod to contemporary issues, specifically the use of torture to obtain information. That resonance, Mr. Mann said, was intentional. “In the movie when Hoover says, ‘Take off the white gloves,’ what he means is, turn informants using extortion, round up innocent family members and make their lives miserable, set aside habeas corpus, be pre-emptive,” he said. “And when Purvis, who doesn’t believe that, starts to go against his native self, it’s disastrous.”

As the start date of “Public Enemies” neared, Mr. Mann was coming off the exhausting experience of writing, directing and producing the 2006 film adaptation of “Miami Vice,” the 1980s television series that made his reputation. That film, plagued by production difficulties, threatened to spiral out of control, and disappointed at the box office, where it brought in just $63 million domestically (less than half its estimated production budget). This time Mr. Mann had to cram preproduction into 11 weeks, an unusually short time for a $100 million period movie that would be shot largely on Midwestern locations. “And then we had radical weather,” he said. “Hailstorms. So the movie became a race, in a way. Not a rush, but a race to get what I had to get.” He finished with a couple of days to spare.

Mr. Mann is known as a perfectionist, someone who wants every visual and technical detail nailed down. Surprisingly, he said that wasn’t the primary challenge on “Public Enemies.” “The biggest struggle, for me is always: Get the story to land,” he said. “Get it to work.

“You know John Dillinger is going to die in front of the Biograph. So by then the story has to have hijacked the show-and-tell nature of the plot. The story has to be about the inner experience of the guy, so that by the end, it’s not about him getting shot. Do you understand his inner experience? Is your heart with him? Do you know him? That’s the battle.”

940 2009-06-29 RUSTENBURG, South Africa (AP) — Xabi Alonso scored on a free kick in extra time Sunday to give Spain a 3-2 victory over South Africa and a third-place finish at the Confederations Cup.

Alonso, a midfielder, curled his shot through a crowd in the penalty area and inside the far post, allowing Spain to rally from its first loss in 35 games. Spain, the European champion, lost to the United States, 2-0, in the semifinals Wednesday.

“It’s a nice way to forget about the loss to the U.S.,” Spain Coach Vicente del Bosque said. “The match was difficult for us. Our opponent created a lot of difficulties for us.”

Katlego Mphela, a substitute, scored both goals for South Africa, known as Bafana Bafana. His goal in injury time tied the score and sent the match into extra time. Dani Guiza had scored in the 88th and 89th minutes to give Spain a 2-1 lead.

“We gave our all,” Aaron Mokoena, the South Africa captain, said. “We made it very difficult for them but I’m very, very devastated.”

942 2009-06-29 WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has advised an Obama administration panel trying to devise a new system for trying terrorist detainees that defendants have some constitutional rights if they are tried by military commissions in the United States, notably including protections regarding statements against them obtained through coercive interrogations, administration officials said Sunday.

The new legal guidance, issued in early May by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, the principal interpreter of the law for the executive branch, suggested that federal courts could set aside convictions by military tribunals that were based on coerced statements on the ground that they violated a defendant’s right to due process.

It is not clear whether the legal advice, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a formal opinion or represents a less binding advisory written at the request of the administration panel exploring ways to deal with detainee issues to fulfill President Obama’s promise to close the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, by next January.

Justice Department officials would not comment on the role of the Office of Legal Counsel in dealing with the issue of coerced statements.

Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The administration is working on a legal framework that will restore military commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecutions in line with the rule of law. Under the previous administration, only three detainees were successfully prosecuted in over seven years. Meanwhile, federal courts have ordered some detainees released and declared the flawed judicial system established to prosecute these detainees unconstitutional.”

It has been known that the Guantánamo panel has been trying to reorganize the military tribunal system, which was put into place by the administration of President George W. Bush, but ran into serious trouble as a result of legal challenges to the fairness of the approach to trying detainees.
943 2009-06-29 Swine flu has already surfaced at summer camps in the South and the West, where the camp season begins early, closing camps in Missouri and California and prompting the Muscular Dystrophy Association to cancel the rest of its annual summer camp program.

Outbreaks of swine flu have also been reported at camps in Georgia and North Carolina, but campers there were being treated on site.

The first task is simply to keep out the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is formally known. Like many camps, Frost Valley recently sent a letter to parents telling them not to send their children to camp if they have flulike symptoms: “fever over 100 degrees and cough, sore throat, runny nose or stuffy nose.” The letter added, “If you suspect your child is getting the flu, it is important that he or she does not attend camp or go anywhere else.”

Mr. Huncosky acknowledged that the rule could challenge some parents, especially those whose own vacations coincide with their children’s camp sessions. “It’s hard when you spend a lot of money to send your child to camp and then the Friday before, they have a little fever,” he said. “Parents might say, ‘We’ve got too much invested.’ ”

Of the 500 campers who arrived on Sunday at Frost Valley, two were found to have a fever as well as other flu symptoms and were sent home.

Frost Valley and other camps said they would try to work with families, either allowing a child to make up lost time in a later session or prorating the fees.

At Buck’s Rock Performing and Creative Arts Camp in New Milford, Conn., opening day was on Wednesday, and the medical staff members took the temperatures of all 260 arriving campers.

There was one case of nits (lice eggs), but no fever, said Mickey Morris, who directs the camp with his wife, Laura. Two families heeded the warnings in three “swine flu updates” the camp had e-mailed, keeping their feverish children home. According to standard protocol, that would be for seven days after the onset of symptoms or until the camper has been symptom-free for 24 hours, whichever is longer.

“At this point, we’re like a sealed community,” Mr. Morris said, adding that the staff lived on site, too.

At the welcome meeting at Buck’s Rock, campers were asked to practice good hygiene, like coughing into their arms and generously applying hand sanitizer before every meal. “We had the Purell stations in the past, but now it’s mandatory, at least until this thing dies down,” he said. “Nobody gets in the dining room without it.”

At Frost Valley, it is hard to escape the hand sanitizer. There are large dispensers on waist-high stands outside the dining halls, and there are more inside. In addition, because of an outbreak of gastrointestinal virus last summer, the camp installed trough-style sinks inside the entrances of the dining hall so that campers would not need to enter the bathrooms to wash up.

“It almost creates a social awkwardness if you’re not washing your hands,” said Tom Holsapple, the director of operations at the camp.

In a nod to swine flu fears, individual campers will no longer retrieve their own utensils. Instead, head counselors will load up trays for their cabins “so we avoid having a bunch of hands going into the pots” of forks and knives, Mr. Holsapple said. The dining hall, which briefly considered banishing the salad bar this summer to prevent unnecessary contact with food, decided instead to order 600 pairs of salad tongs so that campers could avoid sharing at each meal.

At the new wellness center, built to accommodate a total of 60 campers who require dialysis, Patty Conklin, the camp’s health care administrator and a registered nurse, has trained groups of staff members on a range of health issues, including swine flu. On Wednesday, it was the equestrian staff members’ turn. She told them that a staff member or camper who felt sick must report to the wellness center immediately.

“Last year, we had scheduled times to come in, like 10 to 12 and 2 to 4, but I want them here as soon as they feel ill,” Ms. Conklin said.

Campers who display flu symptoms will go into isolation in the negative-pressure rooms, which are designed to let air blow into the rooms when the doors open so that germs do not escape. Their parents will be called, and nurses and others who have contact with sick children will have to wear masks and gloves.

Some camps, like Frost Valley, are prepared to have a child in isolation for a week, but others are not. Mr. Huncosky said his staff would have a “discussion with the parent” to determine the best course.

Adam N. Weinstein, executive director of the American Camp Association’s New York section, which represents about 300 camps, said that camp staffs should plan for ways to engage children who are sequestered, something Frost Valley has already done.

“It’s not ideal, but if you’re at a seven-week camp and you have to miss a week of it in the health center, then the camps should think about the kinds of things you can do in isolation,” he said. “Good seven- or eight-week camps will be thinking about that now and not on the fly.”

At Campus Kids Minisink near Port Jervis, N.Y., where children sleep over Monday through Friday and return home on weekends, Jani Brokaw, the director, said campers were never in isolation for more than 24 hours. “Because we have such regular contact with the parents,” she said, “we would definitely ask the parent to take the child home.”

Some camp directors can envision the worst. “If we had multiple cases, it could easily shut down the camp,” said Philip Connor, chief executive officer of Becket-Chimney Corners Y.M.C.A., adjacent boys’ and girls’ camps in Massachusetts. “You just hope that Mom and Dad aren’t at the bottom of the Grand Canyon when you need to close the camp.”
944 2009-06-29 Mr. Barak himself declined to address the question of a temporary freeze in a conversation on Sunday with The New York Times, saying only that settlements should be viewed as one issue in a larger framework needed to create a Middle East peace.

“For us, it is very important that the Palestinians commit to seeking an end to the conflict and a finality of any claims,” he said. “We should not isolate this issue of settlements and make it the most important one. It has to be discussed in the context of a larger peace discussion.”

He added, “Many Israelis fear that what Palestinians want is not two states but two stages,” meaning an end to Israel in phases. He also said that by focusing solely on settlement building and not on what the Arab countries should also be doing for peace, Israel felt that it was being driven to its knees and delivered to the other side rather than asked to join a shared effort.

Israel, he said, was eager for a regional agreement that would lead to a state for the Palestinians and security for Israel.

The issue of settlement building has plagued regional peace efforts and Israeli-American relations for decades, ever since the 1967 Middle East war ended with Israel holding vast swaths of land that had been won from its neighbors. In particular, taking the West Bank, previously held by Jordan, fired the collective imagination in Israel because so much of it — including the cities of Hebron, Nablus and Jericho — was part of the biblical Jewish homeland that Zionism sought to reclaim.

There are now nearly 300,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank in addition to 200,000 Israeli Jews living in East Jerusalem, also taken in that war. Since the Palestinians hope to build their state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, they accuse Israel of making that goal impossible through settlement building.

Israel says the real problem is Arab rejection of its existence in any borders at all and the rise of violent, radical Islam backed by Iran. When it removed soldiers from southern Lebanon in 2000 and soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, it faced rocket fire from Hezbollah and Hamas.

The Obama administration believes that in order to build a solid regional coalition to confront Iranian ambitions, West Bank settlement building needs to stop as a sign of Israeli willingness to accept a Palestinian state.

Such a demand is part of the “road map” agreed to by the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, the so-called quartet, and signed by Israel. But the Israelis said they had unwritten agreements with the former Bush administration that defined the freeze more narrowly, as not building new settlements or expropriating more land. Last week the quartet issued its own call for a complete settlement freeze.

The issue is so problematic here partly because the three-month-old government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a largely right-wing coalition with parties that support more settlement building. But Mr. Netanyahu recently accepted the idea of two states and has said Israel would work hard on helping the Palestinians improve their lives in the West Bank.

Mr. Barak said on Sunday that Israel was already making progress on that. It has formed a ministerial committee headed by Mr. Netanyahu aimed at starting economic projects in the West Bank. It has also given the Palestinian security forces greater freedom of action in the past couple of weeks.

Mr. Barak presented such steps as examples of concessions Israel had already made that deserved recognition from Washington and Arab leaders. Among the steps being discussed that Arab nations might take as confidence building measures for Israel are permitting Israeli travelers to transit through their airports, allowing Israeli airplanes to fly in their airspace and creating limited academic and tourist exchanges. Among Arab countries, only Egypt and Jordan have full diplomatic relations with Israel.

In the interview, Mr. Barak suggested that there could be a role for an international Middle East peace conference in the coming months at which all sides would agree to steps and concessions. He said that given Washington’s desire to remove its troops from Iraq and find a way to deal with Iran, this was an auspicious moment for bold regional thinking that could make far-reaching changes, and Israel was eager to play its part.
945 2009-06-29 BOGOTÁ, Colombia — With their condemnation on Sunday of the coup ousting President Manuel Zelaya in Honduras, governments in the Western Hemisphere from across the ideological spectrum found a rare issue around which they could swiftly arrive at unity.

At the same time, from the Obama administration’s measured response to the reaction of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who put his military on alert over an apparent affront to the Venezuelan ambassador in Honduras, the responses both revealed and disguised fissures over different forms of democratic government that are taking root in the region.

On the one side are countries like Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, where voters have given much greater power to their populist presidents, partly by allowing them to extend their time in office and sometimes eroding the function of Congress and the Supreme Court, institutions portrayed as allies of the old oligarchy. On the other side are nations of varying ideological hues, including Brazil, Latin America’s rising power, where resilient institutions have allowed for more diversity of participants in politics, ruling out the so-called participatory democracy that Mr. Chávez, the Venezuelan president, has been eager to promote in the region.

Mr. Zelaya himself pushed this tension with institutions to its limits in his clash with Honduras’s judiciary last week over his call for a referendum intended to clear the way for term limits to be eased. On Sunday, the Supreme Court of Honduras said that the military had acted in accordance with the Constitution to remove Mr. Zelaya.

But such legalistic arguments failed to dissuade governments from condemning the coup, particularly in countries like Chile, Argentina and Brazil, where bitter memories linger over human rights abuses by military officials that toppled civilian rulers in the 1960s and 1970s.
946 2009-06-29 The management consulting firms Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby and Watson Wyatt Worldwide said on Sunday that they would merge in an all-stock deal valued at $3.5 billion.

The new firm, to be called Towers Watson & Company, will be a consultancy with 14,000 employees across more than two dozen countries.

Shareholders of Watson Wyatt, which is publicly traded, and Towers Perrin, which is closely held, will each receive 50 percent of the combined company. The new publicly traded company is expected to have annual revenue of more than $3 billion.

John Haley, chief executive of Watson Wyatt, will have that position at Towers Watson, while Mark Mactas, chief of Towers Perrin, will serve as president. The deal is expected to close shortly after a shareholder vote in the fourth quarter.

Watson Wyatt is based in Arlington, Va., and Towers Perrin is based in Stamford, Conn. The companies are looking for a new headquarters in the northeastern United States, Mr. Haley told Bloomberg News.

963 2009-06-30 WASHINGTON — President Obama defended his policies on gay rights on Monday, telling an audience of gay men and lesbians that he remained committed to overturning the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule and that he expected to be judged “not by promises I’ve made but by the promises that my administration keeps.”

Mr. Obama made his remarks at a reception in the East Room of the White House to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion, the 1969 uprising that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement. Joined by his wife, Michelle, the president directly addressed criticism from gay and lesbian leaders that he had not been a forceful advocate for them.

“I know that many in this room don’t believe progress has come fast enough, and I understand that,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s not for me to tell you to be patient any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African-Americans who were petitioning for equal rights a half-century ago.

“We’ve been in office six months now. I suspect that by the time this administration is over, I think you guys will have pretty good feelings about the Obama administration.”

Many lesbians and gay men supported Mr. Obama’s election, but their leaders have grown increasingly impatient and critical of him as president.

Mr. Obama campaigned on a promise of repealing two policies that are anathema to them: the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, and “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which bars gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. The president has been accused of dragging his feet on both, but especially on “don’t ask, don’t tell” because he could use his executive authority to order the military not to enforce the rule.
964 2009-06-30 SEOUL, South Korea — An image of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, shown recently on government-run television appears to be a doctored version of an earlier photo, raising the possibility that Mr. Kim’s health has deteriorated to the point where he has had to skip public appearances, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday.

On June 14, the state-run Central TV showed what it said was a still photo of Mr. Kim posing with a group of soldiers indoors during a visit to a military unit. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, said Tuesday that it looked remarkably similar to a photo the North Korean government had said was taken April 25. The newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence officials as saying that there was “a high possibility” the April image had been recycled.

In both pictures published by Chosun on Monday, Mr. Kim stands with a group of soldiers under what looks like the same ceiling lights and the same Communist slogan. The later image, captured from television, is too blurry to make precise comparisons, but the heights and positioning of the soldiers in both images look strikingly similar, except for 13 figures who do not appear in the later picture.

Officials at the National Intelligence Service, the main South Korean spy agency, said they could not confirm the report.

South Korean analysts and media scrutinize nearly every image and statement from the North for clues about Mr. Kim’s health, a topic of intense interest since last September, when news reports surfaced that Mr. Kim, 67, had suffered a stroke in August. American and South Korean officials say that Mr. Kim appears to have designated his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as his successor.
965 2009-06-30 President Mamadou Tandja dissolved the Constitutional Court on Monday, hours after appointing eight ministers from parties that back his plan for a referendum on extending his term in office. The court had ruled his referendum unlawful, but he has vowed to press ahead, announcing on Friday that he would rule by decree.
966 2009-06-30 “I’m always looking at 2010,” Walsh said, “because I do want to be in the free-agent market in a big way.”

What that means to Lee and Robinson, who are restricted free agents, is not clear. Walsh has a dollar value in mind for each, and the right to match any offer they receive.

Lee will be the greater commodity. He led the N.B.A. last season in double-doubles, with 65, and averaged career bests in scoring (16 points a game) and rebounding (11.7). He will most likely draw interest from at least three of the teams with major salary cap space — Detroit, Oklahoma City and Portland.

Robinson became one of the league’s top sixth men, averaging a career-high 17.2 points and 4.1 assists. His showmanship and flair also made Robinson one of the most marketable players in the league, which could make him attractive to a number of box office-conscious teams.

The Knicks were unwilling to meet the demands of each player last summer, when Lee was seeking about $10 million a year and Robinson about $6 million. The poor economy and a tight market — only four teams have major cap space — should work in the Knicks’ favor.

There are other options for all parties. Robinson, for instance, could simply accept the Knicks’ qualifying offer ($2.9 million), play out the season and become an unrestricted free agent next summer, when at least a dozen teams will have major cap space. If Lee’s price is too high, the Knicks could arrange a sign-and-trade deal, although they are notoriously difficult to execute.

No signings or trades can be made official until the N.B.A.’s annual moratorium ends, on July 8. Teams and players often come to terms during the moratorium, however, so the Knicks could strike a deal any time in the next week.

The Knicks also have a strong interest in Kidd, the 36-year-old Dallas Mavericks point guard and former Nets star. Kidd, who still has an off-season home in New York, could be tempted. The Knicks have only the midlevel exception (about $5.6 million) to spend, however, and they will probably offer only a one-year deal. The Mavericks could easily top that, so the flirtation may be brief.

Indeed, with the Knicks reluctant to tie up their payroll beyond next season, it is unlikely they will add any significant free agents this summer.

The Knicks could have shed about $20.5 million in payroll had Al Harrington and Eddy Curry declined contract options for next season, but both have elected to return. A letter from Harrington making his decision official is expected Tuesday afternoon.
967 2009-06-30 Russia signed a major natural gas deal with Azerbaijan on Monday, striking a blow to European efforts to reduce energy reliance on Russia. Russia will buy 500 million cubic meters of gas annually from Azerbaijan starting next year. The deal could undercut competing European pipeline projects by depriving them of a source for gas, but President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who traveled to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the signing, said there was no political motive behind the deal.
968 2009-06-30 The salary cap is not expected to change much from last season’s $58.7 million, but it could drop by 10 percent next season, by some estimates. The luxury-tax threshold could also fall, forcing teams to rein in spending now.

More than 100 players will become free agents at midnight Tuesday. Negotiations will commence soon after, although no deals can be consummated until July 8, after the annual moratorium.

Teams are already cutting back. Last week, the Milwaukee Bucks practically gave away Richard Jefferson, a high-scoring forward, in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs. The Bucks received a package of expiring contracts designed to reduce their payroll. Two days later, the Phoenix Suns traded O’Neal to Cleveland, and the Nets sent Vince Carter to Orlando, also for cap-friendly contracts.

The Bucks continued their payroll slashing on Monday when, in a surprise move, they declined to tender a qualifying offer to Charlie Villanueva, their promising young forward. The move made Villanueva an unrestricted free agent and probably ended his career in Milwaukee.

The Boston Celtics, who won the championship in 2008, have been offering their starting guards, Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo, in trade talks, in part because of financial considerations.

The tight market could force players to change their plans. Carlos Boozer, an All-Star forward for the Utah Jazz, had signaled that he would opt out of the final year of his contract, which pays $12.7 million. But with few teams willing to bid for him, Boozer is reportedly hedging his decision.

The only player guaranteed a maximum payout is the Los Angeles Lakers’ Kobe Bryant, the most valuable player of the N.B.A. finals. Bryant has indicated he intends to opt out of his contract and sign a new multiyear deal with the Lakers.

The Lakers may have the most to lose in free agency — forwards Trevor Ariza and Lamar Odom — and thus the most to gain from the recession. Odom is unlikely to match the $14.1 million he made this season, but Ariza can expect a significant raise from $3.1 million.

The Magic, which lost to the Lakers in the finals, could also lose a key starter. By acquiring Carter, who will make $16.3 million, Orlando made it nearly impossible to re-sign Hedo Turkoglu, who opted out of his contract. Turkoglu was scheduled to make $7.3 million next season and will be looking for a raise. Re-signing him would force the Magic to pay the luxury tax, which the franchise has been reluctant to do.

The biggest buyer this summer will probably be the Detroit Pistons, who could have about $20 million in cap space after letting Rasheed Wallace and Allen Iverson leave. The Pistons have reportedly targeted Ben Gordon, the hot-shooting Chicago Bulls guard, and will also be shopping for a big man, possibly Boozer or his Jazz teammate Paul Millsap.

The other teams with significant cap space are Portland, Memphis and Oklahoma City, although it is not clear how much the Grizzlies and the Thunder are willing to spend. The Trail Blazers are reportedly interested in Turkoglu. They also need a point guard, and there are three top veterans available: Dallas’s Jason Kidd, Philadelphia’s Andre Miller and Atlanta’s Mike Bibby.

The lower-tier free agents will probably have to settle for re-signing with their teams or accepting a midlevel exception elsewhere. However, some team executives predict that only three or four teams will use their midlevel exceptions.

“No one knows what the marketplace is going to be,” said an Eastern Conference general manager, who did not want to be quoted speculating about the market. “It’s a brand new world in that respect. This year, the top-flight free agents will go quickly. Then, it will be a long free-agent period. I just don’t see people rushing out to pay big money or taking chances.”
969 2009-06-30 In that NATO position, he will be a partner with Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who recently became the new commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, where he must carry out a new strategy that is the premier national security initiative of the Obama administration.

In a recent interview, Admiral Stavridis said his priorities for Afghanistan would include “working with allies and friends to conduct focused counterinsurgency work that puts protecting the Afghan people at the center of the equation,” a goal that parallels the objectives of General McChrystal.

Admiral Stavridis said he would immediately begin work toward “increasing training teams” sent from NATO nations to build up Afghanistan’s army and police, a pillar of the Obama administration’s strategy.

He said he was well aware of the frustration among American commanders in Afghanistan that some NATO countries continue to restrict the combat role of their troops — a point of view voiced by powerful members of Congress who approve money for Afghanistan.

Admiral Stavridis said that “reducing caveats” imposed by some allied governments on their troops remains a goal. But he also has acknowledged “that we need to think about asking our allies to do what they are willing to do, and recognize where there are places they just cannot go.”

NATO support to the Afghan war effort “runs the gamut of things from money to civil-military interaction,” he said, with an emphasis on future contributions of money and personnel to bolster Afghan security forces.

Admiral Stavridis’s background may mean he is well-suited for reading NATO’s complex and often-conflicting geography of national priorities. His grandfather was an ethnic Greek born and raised in Turkey, Greece’s historical rival, who immigrated to the United States in 1910. Admiral Stavridis was born in 1955 in West Palm Beach, Fla., to a military family, and he lived in Greece as a young child while his father, an officer in the Marines, was assigned to the United States Embassy in Athens.

With an undergraduate degree from the Naval Academy, and a master’s degree and doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Admiral Stavridis has drawn the attention of Navy leaders and senior Pentagon civilians for his understanding of strategic doctrine, long-range planning and international affairs.

He directed the Navy’s secret organization called “Deep Blue,” which served as an operations team and policy analysis group for the Navy leadership. He was executive assistant to Richard Danzig during his tenure as Navy secretary under President Bill Clinton. And the admiral also was a senior military assistant to Donald H. Rumsfeld during his time as defense secretary.

Mr. Gates complimented the admiral for turning the Southern Command into “the embodiment of what is now called ‘smart power,’ drawing on the full strength of our nation and our partners to enhance security, freedom and prosperity in this part of the world.”

Reflecting on his tour as the top officer at Southern Command, Admiral Stavridis said he was proud of the counterinsurgency and counternarcotics assistance to Colombia, and the efforts that resulted in stopping more than 650 tons of cocaine from arriving in the United States.

Dealing with the narcotics trade, which is the major contributor of funds to the Afghan insurgency, will be central to his new job.
970 2009-06-30 The clinical trials system cannot accommodate the present crop of promising but untested new drugs. This is because clinical cancer research receives only an estimated five cents of every cancer research dollar.

Lack of access to clinical trials is a major hurdle in our war on cancer; better funding is imperative.

The writer is director of cancer research at Norwalk Hospital and author of “Fighting Cancer With Knowledge and Hope.”

As the chairman of a National Institutes of Health peer review panel concerned with new ways to understand the brain in health and disease, I can provide a reviewer’s perspective on your cancer research article.

Our panels evaluate, recommend and score on the basis of impact (which includes potential significance of results, soundness of approach and qualifications of scientists), recognizing that the N.I.H.’s mission is to improve the public health. Experienced scientific reviewers understand the need to balance widely different questions and approaches in order to decide which proposals are likely to be the most effective.

A constant need is getting more first-rank researchers to serve as reviewers. Peer review remains imperfect, but it continues to serve the public good.

Finally, in addition to the new “transformative” mechanisms mentioned in your article, the N.I.H. has long encouraged more speculative approaches that do not require preliminary data.

The writer is head of the Laboratory of Neuroinformatics and professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Medical College of Cornell University.

A solution to the dysfunction highlighted in your article would be to fund researchers on a retrospective rather than prospective basis. Reviewers would assess what a researcher has accomplished in the past rather than what she says she plans to do.

By its nature, the outcome of scientific research is unpredictable. Grants typically run from three to five years. It is difficult to foresee what will happen in the laboratory this afternoon let alone years from now.

The National Institutes of Health already reviews its own staff researchers on a retrospective basis. There is no reasons the same approach could not be used for the researchers that it funds at universities and hospitals.

The writer is a professor of neurology at the University of California, Davis. He was formerly a senior research scientist at the National Institutes of Health.

The problems discussed in your article have been acknowledged by leaders of science for many years. They have expressed disappointment in the progress of science because of overinvestment in incremental development of established directions and underinvestment in high-risk, high-payoff exploration of new ideas. The Obama administration has the opportunity to address this problem by instituting long-discussed remedies.

These include the creation of a science venture capital fund with 10 percent of the science budget, run by scientists who have succeeded in high-risk, high-payoff research and venture capitalists who know how to recognize, support and evaluate ambitious but risky proposals.

The universities and funding agencies can also contribute by changing the incentives for tenure and continued funding to reward those who repeatedly take the risks of introducing new ideas, switching fields and wandering out of well-defined areas.

The writer is a senior researcher, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.

Having served on numerous National Institutes of Health review panels, I agree that the system is “very good at ruling out bad things.” I am surprised that Dr. Richard D. Klausner, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, speaking of the review system for funding, describes “an incredible sense of consensus that it is not working.”

We evaluate the scientific merit and innovation of each proposal carefully, often recognizing prudent risks. Ultimately, federally funded cancer research can support the foundation of higher education: teaching and learning along the path toward discovery.

The writer is dean, College of Natural, Applied and Health Sciences at Kean University.

“Playing It Safe in Cancer Research” was spot on for this biomedical scientist for 35 years. The funding problems cited in the article affect biomedical research on diseases besides cancer.

Major flaws in the funding review process include the call for “preliminary data” (as mentioned in the article); favoritism to known research centers; attempts by reviewers to show their expertise by being hypercritical; pressure from universities to generate funds; and a bias toward reviewers who are 30 to 40 years old.

Your article struck a personal as well as a professional chord for me. I have spent my career researching treatments for addictions, a field where I figure we now have over a thousand published clinical trials on ways to treat alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug problems.

When I learned I had a very common prostate cancer two months ago, my doctor described different treatments available, and said that patients basically decide among them “based on their gut.”

My gut? I’d like some science to help me with a life-changing decision, please! So I went to the medical literature to read comparative clinical trials and was astonished to find only a handful, the best of which was from Sweden. Where is all that cancer research funding going?
971 2009-06-30 Tibetan monks and nuns may spend 12 hours a day studying Buddhist philosophy and logic, reciting prayers and debating scriptures. But science has been given a special boost by the Dalai Lama, who has long advocated modern education in Tibetan monasteries and schools in exile, alongside Tibet’s traditions. India is home to at least 120,000 Tibetans, the largest population outside Tibet.

Science may seem at odds with Tibetan religious rituals. Reincarnations of high Tibetan monks are identified through dreams and auspicious signs. The Dalai Lama credits the state oracle with helping him decide to flee Tibet in 1959 as Chinese troops advanced on Lhasa.

Yet the Tibetan spiritual leader views science and Buddhism as complementary “investigative approaches with the same greater goal, of seeking the truth,” he wrote in “The Universe in a Single Atom,” his book on “how science and spirituality can serve our world.” He stresses that science is especially important for monastics who study the nature of the mind and the relationship between mind and brain.

Initial resistance from some senior monks and fears of diluting traditional studies in monasteries have gradually eased. Now the Dalai Lama hopes that, with help from Emory and other programs, science will become part of a new curriculum, with science textbooks in Tibetan and specialist translators, leading to a generation of monastic leaders that are scientifically literate.

There are other reasons for integrating science with Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetans marked the 50th anniversary of their exile this year, and a return to their homeland remains elusive. The need to keep Tibetan cultural identity alive, yet modern and relevant, has grown increasingly urgent as the 73-year-old Dalai Lama ages.

“If you remain isolated, you will disappear,” said Lhakdor, director of the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, in Dharamsala, who goes by one name. The Dalai Lama himself has often remarked that isolation from the world only aided Tibet’s fall to China.

Lhakdor also sees similarities rather than contradictions between science and Buddhism. Like Buddhism, “the approach of science is generally based on unbiased findings through observation, analysis and finding the truth,” he noted.

Others are more frank about the need to learn science. “The 21st century is here. Everybody is influenced by science. We want to know what it is,” said Tenzin Lhadron, a forthright 34-year-old nun enrolled in this summer’s science program.

She does not have formal schooling in spite of 19 years studying at a nunnery in Dharamsala. Math is difficult for her; fractions and percentages are completely new. “But I will try,” she promised.

The Emory Tibet Science Initiative, of which this session was part, is now in its second year. It was preceded by the “Science for Monks” program, which started in 2001 with support from Bobby Sager, a Boston philanthropist. At the behest of the Dalai Lama, the earlier program brought science teachers from various American universities to teach Tibetan monks in India.

That program has matured into the Emory-backed plan to introduce modern science into Tibetan monasteries in India within the next few years with help from the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives.

The Emory initiative has led to a science textbook in Tibetan and English, produced by Emory professors and translators from the library. Translation conferences yielded a science glossary that introduces words like electromagnetism, climate change and cloning into the Tibetan lexicon.

The original Science for Monks program has morphed into an annual two-week Science Leadership summer program for advanced students who are all geshes, the monastic equivalent of a Ph.D. This year it culminated in a first-ever “science fair” here from June 22 to June 24. There, monks gave presentations on sound waves, the origins of the universe and how the brain works.

Emory envisions the summer course as a five-year program with lessons becoming more advanced in successive years for the returning students.

A third program, called Science Meets Dharma, has since 2002 sent European college graduates to teach basic science courses in Tibetan monasteries in India. When some monks enroll in the intensive science programs they have already had a few years of science instruction.

Just how science will be taught in the monasteries is still in the works. Western faculty will teach to monastics for extended periods, but local Tibetan lay teachers will eventually be recruited to teach in monasteries year round. Science education already exists in the Tibetan exile school system that instructs 28,000 children and young adults in India, Nepal and Bhutan.

For the time being, university professors are needed for the summer science course. Monks and nuns may lack basic science education, but they are highly trained in other disciplines, like philosophy.

“They are sophisticated adult learners,” said Mark Risjord, professor of philosophy at Emory who taught math and logic this summer. During his weeklong unit, inquisitive monks pressed him for a method to “make deductively valid rules” and asked if different arguments can lead to the same conclusion.

Although Buddhist scriptures have their own explanations of nature, the mind and the physical world, students were unfazed about seeming contradictions between Buddhism and western science.

“There are contradictions within Buddhist philosophy itself,” pointed out Lobsang Gompo, a 27-year-old monk from Drepung monastery in south India. Tibetan Buddhists are already accustomed to analyzing multiple viewpoints, he said.

The Dalai Lama’s confidence in “critical investigation” means that “if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims,” he wrote in “The Universe in a Single Atom.”

Lhadron, the nun, added, “Buddhists believe whatever reality is there, not just what such and such a text says.”

While the Tibetan monastics come away from the program enriched, so do the Westerners. There is growing interest from the West about the relationship between the mind and body — for instance, the physical effects of meditation.

A new Emory program for undergraduates brought 14 students, mostly premed students, to Dharamsala this summer to study Buddhist thought and Tibetan medicine.

The science initiative also paves the way for Tibetan monastics to engage in future dialogue with Western scientists, another project fostered by the Dalai Lama in the form of annual conferences of the Mind and Life Institute that bring together Western researchers and monks in the United States and Dharamsala. “If monastics are not aware of scientific concepts, they can’t communicate and collaborate,” said Lobsang Negi, director of the Emory Tibet Science Initiative.

The program broadens the horizons of the Western science teachers, too, whether by teaching across cultures or thinking about science through the lens of ethics and human values as emphasized in Buddhism.

For Arri Eisen, a biology professor at Emory, teaching the monks and nuns helped him consider “how to nurture positive thinking. Western education doesn’t nurture empathy.”

Science may be far advanced in the West, but a moral vacuum exists, said Bryce Johnson, an environmental engineer who coordinates the Science for Monks program. “There’s something lost in the West,” Dr. Johnson said. The meeting of science and Buddhism is “a healthy exchange that is as much for the scientists.”
972 2009-06-30 Your editorial about the Dream Act and the doors that are currently closed to undocumented young people (“Graduation Dreams,” June 24) provided more wrenching testimony about the waste of human potential fostered by our current immigration policies.

The youth you describe and thousands of others like them in the United States want to get on with their lives, finish their educations, get jobs and continue to contribute to their adopted country. This worthy legislation will allow law-abiding students to graduate, obtain meaningful employment and plan for the future. They want to contribute to the only home they have ever known. These children hold the keys to America’s future and should not be denied their dreams.

I trust that President Obama will put these deserving youth on the path to brighter, legitimate futures.

973 2009-06-30 Even had a gold been awarded, however, this would still have been a deeply depressing affair. Not that its standards of delivery were low; what was dismaying was that the competition — all three rounds of which were sampled at the gala — elicited from the dancers a great deal of what is anti-artistic, sensationalist and trite about ballet. Some of these hoopla aspects go back decades, even centuries: people were complaining — with justice, I believe — in Paris in the 18th century and in St. Petersburg in the 19th that artistry was being sacrificed to acrobatics. But at least nobody then was giving silver or bronze medals to the young for acquiring early crowd-pleasing tactics in trashed versions of great choreography.

Margot Fonteyn once remarked, during her retirement, that too many of the young dancers she saw were doing steps but not dancing. The competition’s gala offerings went further: they pointed to teachers, coaches, judges, students and former contestants who had intensively labored to eliminate all suspicion of dancing from numbers that were all applause-winning steps. What few gaps there were between steps and stunts were filled with cuteness.

One of the many remarkable features about Marius Petipa’s three-act “Raymonda” (1898), the last of that great choreographer’s works to survive, was that unlike most Petipa ballets it had no grand pas de deux. (Another is that the title role was planned for a prima ballerina assoluta in her prime. I have seen very young ballerinas, even graduating students, dance it impressively, but only in a full choreographic context.) In the final act Petipa instead constructed a grand adagio for Raymonda, her bridegroom and a corps of supporting couples; he then planned a series of dance variations for various soloists, climaxing in the powerfully scented one for Raymonda herself with the orchestra led by piano; then he brought everyone together in the coda.

Never mind: the competition knew how to circumnavigate this inconvenience. The ballerina Cynthia Gregory rearranged the suite to make just the kind of standard four-part grand pas de deux (supported adagio for woman and man; male variation; female variation; coda for both) that Petipa had taken pains to avoid, and she had given it to these students as the competition’s Round 1.

For Round 3 Winthrop Corey had similarly rearranged the Grand Pas from “Paquita” (which should feature a corps de ballet and a series of guest ballerinas) into a “Wedding Pas de Deux.” Round 2 was a duet adapted from Paul Taylor’s “Aureole,” which few ballet dancers find congenial in style. What results is usually one of those offerings that encourage ballet audiences to decide that modern dance must be merely watered-down ballet for performers without much technique.

The second half of the “Aureole” duet as danced by Caroline Betancourt and Ben Needham-Wood (United States) proved among the evening’s few fresh moments. Other bright spots were the start of Liza’s variation from “La Fille Mal Gardée” (attributed to the choreographer “M. Isunpov”) as danced by Yevgeniya Korshunova (Ukraine) and, in particular, the “Paquita” adagio as danced by Amber Neumann and John M. Giragosian (United States). Ms. Neumann and Mr. Giragosian really danced this: the warmth and pliancy of her upper body, the courtesy with which he lowered her slowly to the floor from lifts and the keen musical ear they both showed were genuine pleasures, along with the glow they gave off in their costumes and the remarkable harmony they showed when doing the same movements.

But then these two likable young dancers went on to do their solos and a coda, during which those winning dance qualities did not disappear — in particular, they both have very fine timing — but became incidental. Not all Mr. Giragosian’s bravura steps suited him, and Ms. Neumann (to whom Mr. Corey had given the dullest and flashiest of the many female variations in “Paquita”) shed her bloom and turned herself into a hard-boiled point-scoring technician. These two may well not deserve gold medals; they merely remembered, in that adagio, to dance.

It is arguable that competitions in general are doing much to spoil the art of ballet, but I have seen too few to support this contention. I do say, however, that the gold medal of this competition would have been no compliment to any true artist.
974 2009-06-30 “I don’t think we know what this virus is going to do yet,” said one of its discoverers, Dr. Cynda Crawford of the University of Florida veterinary school.

When Dr. Crawford began studying it in January 2004, it had come to her notice as a mysterious cough and pneumonia that killed a third of the greyhounds at a Florida dog track. By the next year, she had found it in seven states and had shown that it could be passed by dogs who just rubbed noses on the street or shared a water dish, and that humans could carry it on their clothes. There was a brief flurry of fear that it would kill 1 percent to 10 percent of the country’s 70 million dogs.

It has proved about as deadly as Dr. Crawford predicted. She estimates that by itself, it kills 5 percent of the dogs that catch it. Add the deaths at shelters that eliminate the virus by killing all their dogs and disinfecting their cages, and the total mortality rate is 8 percent.

But it has not spread nearly as vigorously as she expected. It has now been found in 30 states, but almost exclusively in settings where dogs live closely together: shelters, pet stores, kennels and dog schools. Because the owners of these establishments have learned to turn away sick dogs just as school principals facing swine flu send home sick children, the disease’s progress has been slowed.

“Probably over 10,000 dogs have been infected,” Dr. Crawford said, “but I can’t say whether it’s 20,000 or 30,000. In a population of 70 million, that’s a drop in the bucket.”

Dr. Edward J. Dubovi of the veterinary school at Cornell University, another discoverer of the virus, said it is “probably not as well adapted to dogs as it could be.” It took five mutations to let it jump to dogs from horses, where it had circulated for 40 years.

Another mutation or two “could make it a very serious issue,” he said, but at the moment, “it takes a certain density of dogs to keep it going.”

Some veterinarians have found that the dogs that tend to die from it are the “brachycephalics” — dogs with short snub noses.

Just as obesity has proved dangerous to human flu victims because of the weight on their chests, being bred to have a short, bent respiratory tract is dangerous for dogs.

“It really puts a strain on their ability to breathe,” Dr. Crawford said. “They can’t move air in and out of their lungs.”
975 2009-06-30 Next to each of these entrees on the menu, in parentheses, was the cost of what it would cost to order that entree from the à la carte menu. These prices didn’t affect the cost of the prix fixe meal, which was the equivalent of $30 no matter what the entree, but the researchers expected just the sight of the prices to make a difference. If the mullet were listed at $20 and the other entrees were $17, more people would presumably be enticed into ordering the seemingly more valuable fish.

But after three months of testing various combinations of prices, the researchers found they couldn’t sway the customers. Putting a higher price on the shrimp or any other entree didn’t make people more likely to order it.

This same stubbornly independent streak was manifest in another food experiment by the same researchers. This time they let people sample two kinds of candies — peanut butter bars and caramels — and varied the sticker prices for each one.

Superficially, the manipulation seemed to work, because people said they would be willing to pay more for a candy if it had a higher sticker price, but that was just in answer to a hypothetical question. When people were given a chance to pick a bag of candy to take home, they pretty much ignored the sticker prices and chose what they liked.

Why weren’t people duped into favoring the high-priced candies and entrees? Why did they follow their own tastes?

“Maybe, sometimes, old-fashioned economics is just about right,” Dr. Shayo says. “Maybe when it comes to food, people do have reasonably stable preferences. Some people like shrimp and some don’t, even if it’s worth a lot of money.”

The researchers don’t deny that consumers can be swayed by variations in sticker prices in laboratory experiments. But they question how significant that factor is in real-world settings where prices can’t be inflated so extremely, like the Tel Aviv restaurant. “Size is everything,” Dr. Heffetz says. “Our findings remind us that knowing that ‘A has a positive effect on B’ is not enough. The effect may simply be too small to matter.”

The size-matters effect seemed to show up in a much less rigorous bit of research conducted at my TierneyLab blog with the help of Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico. In his new book, “Spent: Sex, Evolution and Consumer Behavior” (Viking), he argues that humans often waste money because of the unconscious — and mistaken — belief that our costly stuff will signal our intelligence and sterling personality traits to potential mates and allies.

As an exercise, Dr. Miller asked readers of the blog to list the 10 most expensive things they had ever bought, and then list the 10 purchases that had brought them the most happiness. More than 200 responded. As we expected, many people rued spending lots of money for stuff that hadn’t brought them joy. Boats seemed to have particularly low utility in delivering happiness per dollar; many cars fit that category, too, and so did many expensive weddings.

But we were struck by how much overlap there was between the most-expensive list and the most-happy list. People repeatedly included on both lists their homes, their college education, their vacation trips, their high-priced electronics (large-screen televisions, Blu-Ray player, audio equipment, computers) and certain models of cars (BMW 325, Audi A4, Jaguar, Subaru WRX, Toyota Prius, Honda Civic).

Indeed, the first trend that Dr. Miller identified was the match between the happiness and expense lists. Some of this may have been because of postpurchase rationalization, but a lot of buyers seemed to be suffering anything but remorse. As one reader, Janet Hubbs, put it:

“The three things (not necessities) I have spent the most money on in the past ten years are: my cottage at Cape Cod, my Lexus, and my Rolex — and I LOVE all three, in the order of their cost. And I don’t care what that says about me.”
976 2009-06-30 Mr. Jobs underwent a liver transplant about two months ago, but word of the operation did not surface until earlier this month. Last week, a hospital in Tennessee confirmed that he had surgery there and said his prognosis was excellent.

News of the operation rekindled a controversy among shareholders and corporate governance experts about Apple’s scant disclosures regarding the health of Mr. Jobs, a survivor of pancreatic cancer. His return to work is not likely to quell the debate.

“We don’t know much,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “We know he is back at work and that he had a transplant. Given how important he seems to be to the value of this business, we ought to have the facts in front us that the board had in bringing him back.” During his absence, Apple said little about Mr. Jobs other than repeating that he would be back at the end of June. Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management, said Apple’s insistence on secrecy damaged the company’s credibility.

“At every stage, the rumor mill was more informative and accurate than the company’s external communications,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “The fact that they’ve gotten away with it sets a very low bar.”

With Mr. Jobs’s return widely expected, Wall Street’s reaction to the news on Monday was muted. Apple shares closed at $141.97, down 47 cents.

Tim Cook, the chief operating officer, who managed the company during Mr. Jobs’s absence, kept its business humming, analysts said. But Mr. Jobs’s vision, attention to product detail and ability to inspire employees are unmatched and have shaped Apple’s success, so the hope is that he will stick around, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “Everyone is glad to have him back, but is understanding that things can change,” Mr. Munster said.

In Silicon Valley and beyond, critics and fans of Mr. Jobs alike said they were elated by his return to work, which appeared to signal that his health had stabilized.

“The entire Valley is happy to see that he is back,” said Paul Holland, a veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist. “Certainly many of us had our doubts.”

Mr. Holland, who is a partner at Foundation Capital, said the return of Mr. Jobs was good news for the region and the industry because of the broad impact that Apple has had.

“To have a hit company that has been booming for several years is very important for the symbolism it represents for the Valley, as well as for the impact it has on business,” Mr. Holland said.

Mr. Jobs’s return was also welcome news on Apple’s campus in Cupertino, Calif., Mr. Dowling said. “We’re very glad to have him back,” he said.
977 2009-06-30 BANGKOK — Viktor Bout, a Russian businessman suspected of arms trafficking who faces possible extradition to the United States, is pursuing what his lawyer calls a rare legal procedure that accuses American officials of overstepping their jurisdiction in a sting operation here last year.

The procedure could delay the extradition process and, if successful, result in criminal charges filed against three agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration who took part in Mr. Bout’s arrest, according to the lawyer, Chamroen Panompakakorn.

Mr. Chamroen said Monday that American agents had violated Thai law by apprehending Mr. Bout on their own before calling the Thai police to arrest him. They were also carrying firearms in violation of Thai law, he said.

“They invaded a public place without a search warrant,” Mr. Chamroen said in an interview. “They have no power to do this.”

The accusations may resonate among Thai officials who sometimes complain of a heavy-handed approach among the large contingent of American intelligence and law enforcement officials stationed here.
