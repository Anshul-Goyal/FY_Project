17 2011-07-01 The theater, which is a nonprofit, regularly donates its tent to charities including Bread & Roses and Zaccho Dance Theatre for fund-raisers. Teatro ZinZanni estimates that the various charities have raised more than $2 million through fund-raisers in its venue over the course of a decade.

If something does not change in the next few weeks, “we’re dead in the water,” said Norman Langill, Teatro ZinZanni founder.

“It’s important that we get a site, important that the site be long term,” said Mr. Langill, who also operates the production in Seattle. “Our commitment is for years.”

The City of San Francisco said that finding a new home for the theater was a priority.

“We’re helping because they are a longstanding cultural institution that brings a lot of people to the waterfront,” said Anne Taupier, project manager at the Mayor’s Office of Economic and Workforce Development.

(The theater was already threatened with relocation by the anticipated development of a cruise ship pier and has been operating on a short-term lease.)An alternative site was identified earlier this year, but it fell through after the nonprofit had invested about three months and around $42,000 making plans for it.

Ms. Taupier said that the site was not large enough for the theater and that the city had run into problems with the underground utilities.

Now the city and the theater have their hopes pinned on another waterfront site about which Ms. Taupier said she was “optimistic.”

Even though Teatro ZinZanni’s existence in San Francisco depends on the search for a permanent home, the whole production is designed around a special roaming performance tent called a spiegeltent, first spotted by Mr. Langill while in Barcelona for another production during the 1992 Summer Olympics.

“When I walked in, I was transported,” he said,.

He was also inspired while traveling in Germany by “variety theater, Marlene Dietrich and ‘Blue Angel’ — what you might call vaudeville.”

While the term “dinner theater” might conjure up visions of Las Vegas nightclubs, Teatro ZinZanni has grown into “a new art form,” said Yevgeniy Voronin, a magician who co-stars with Joan Baez in the company’s current show, “Maestro’s Enchantment.”

The performances at ZinZanni are multifaceted. While the main performers, like Mr. Voronin and Ms. Baez, develop whole story lines over the course of the night, many of the waiters double as actors or dancers.

The dinner is not just sneaked in while the audience’s eyes are on the stage: every course is announced with operatic song, and the meal is frequently interrupted by the performers doing magic tricks or cracking jokes at individual tables.

“You can’t describe it in a single word,” said Mr. Langill, who has also been a playwright and is the founder of One Reel, an event production company. “It’s a combination of theater, stand-up comedy, popular music and circus in an intimate format that breaks the fourth wall.”

Backstage after a recent show, Ms. Baez spoke about what led her to Teatro ZinZanni.

“Ten years ago, that was the first time I saw it,” she said. “I was infatuated. I called up and said, ‘I want to be in the circus!’”

Ms. Baez jumped into the role of Madame ZinZanni, off and on, for the better part of the decade. She will be appearing in the current show through July.

The specter of closing up shop was “highly distressing” to the staff, said Stanley Morris, who runs Restaurant TZ, the food part of the operation.

And as a barefoot Ms. Baez leapt up from a couch to welcome her mother amid an array of other performers’ children and friends hanging out, the atmosphere of ZinZanni did seem familiar.

Sergiy Krutikov, a Moscow Circus veteran, pulled out an accordion and started to play. Ms. Baez, who lives in Woodside, began doing a polka.
18 2011-07-01 MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (Reuters) — Uruguay’s government issued a decree on Thursday giving judges the authority to investigate human rights cases that occurred during the military dictatorship that controlled the country from 1973 to 1985.

A year after democracy was restored in Uruguay, a small, South American nation of 3.4 million people, the government passed an amnesty law protecting security officers from prosecution.

But leftist coalitions that have been in power since 2005 have determined that some cases fall outside the provisions of the amnesty law, and about 20 former military personnel have been tried and convicted.

About 200 Uruguayans were kidnapped and killed during military rule and many more people were arrested and tortured. Uruguayans remain divided over how to deal with former military officers who have been accused of human rights crimes.

The decree, signed by President José Mujica and his cabinet on Thursday, will allow the judiciary to proceed with as many as 80 human rights cases that are pending investigation, the government said.

The Uruguayan Congress rejected a proposal last month to repeal the amnesty law that shields former military officers from prosecution for crimes committed during the dictatorship; the proposed bill split the leftist governing coalition.
19 2011-07-01 A free-market conservative, he opposed the Vietnam War largely for economic reasons. The money could be put to better use, he argued, addressing domestic problems normally thought of as the preoccupation of liberals, like education, social injustice and urban decline.

A survey by Congressional Quarterly in 1974 found that he had voted against a majority of his Republican colleagues 72 percent of the time the previous year.

Mr. Whalen also took a resolute stand in favor of press freedom, especially the right of journalists to protect confidential sources. He addressed the subject in “Your Right to Know” (1973), to which the CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite contributed a foreword.

Charles William Whalen Jr., known as Chuck, was born on July 31, 1920, in Dayton. He attended the University of Dayton, where he received a degree in business education in 1942. During World War II he served with the Army in the China, India and Burma theater.

After earning a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard in 1946, he became vice president of the Dayton Dress Company, owned by his father.

In the early 1950s he began teaching at the University of Dayton, where he became chairman of the economics department in 1962. He served in the state’s General Assembly for 12 years, writing the state’s first fair-housing law, before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1967.

He was hugely popular in his home district, even though Democrats and Independents far outnumbered Republicans, and even though his antiwar stance threatened jobs at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton.

A tireless door-to-door campaigner, in 1970 and 1972 he carried his district with three-quarters of the vote. In 1974 he was the only congressman to run unopposed in both the primary and the general election.

He retired in 1979, tired of the increasing friction with local party officials and Republican leaders in Washington, who found him too liberal. He also expressed frustration with Congress as an agent for change.

“We’ve come to realize there is a limit to our powers,” he told The New York Times in 1978, explaining why he and several other House members were not running for re-election. “We have a feeling that we’re not as powerful as we thought we were.”

After leaving office, he became a Democrat.

He spent much of his time in retirement doing the research for two works of history that he wrote with his wife, Barbara, a former journalist: “The Longest Debate: A Legislative History of the 1964 Civil Rights Act” (1985) and “The Fighting McCooks: America’s Famous Fighting Family” (2006), about two Ohio brothers and their 13 sons who served in the Union Army during the Civil War.

Mr. Whalen, who lived in Bethesda, Md., is survived by his wife and their six children, Charles, of Delray Beach, Fla.; Daniel, of Washington; Edward, of Reston, Va.; Joseph, of Lambertville, N.J.; Anne McLindon of Bethesda; and Mary Scherer of Brambleton, Va.; and seven grandchildren.
20 2011-07-01 The F.B.I. said that members of an anti-gay church took part in training of police officers and agents, a move the F.B.I. says it will take steps to remedy. The church, Westboro Baptist of Topeka, Kan., contends God is punishing the military for tolerance of homosexuality and has protested at military funerals. An F.B.I. spokesman said the group was invited “to establish open dialogue in an academic setting to train law enforcement on how to more effectively engage with the activist community.”
21 2011-07-01 A huge harvest in August could ultimately slow food inflation. It typically takes six months for changes in commodity prices to affect retail food prices in the United States. Analysts said consumers could see some relief at the supermarket by early 2012.

“All of us who perceived tighter supplies up to this point, all of us were proven wrong today,” said Jason Ward, an analyst with Northstar Commodity in Minneapolis.

Industry traders had expected 90.8 million acres of corn to be planted. Knowing that far more corn is in the pipeline will likely pull grain prices down significantly this summer, Mr. Ward said.

Farmers chose to plant corn at the expense of this year’s soybean crop. They planted 75.2 million acres of soybeans, about 3 percent less than last year.

Farmers have a limited supply of good farmland and usually trade one crop for another on their acreage.

“It seemed to me there was $100 to $150 per acre more money in the corn than there was in the beans,” said Tom Kreutzer, who planted 150 acres of corn on his farm near Wakeeney, Kan. “That’s the kind of math that a lot of guys were using.”

A separate report from the Agriculture Department on Thursday estimated the United States had 3.67 billion bushels of corn in storage. Most analysts were expecting a reserve of 3.3 billion bushels, said John Sanow, an analyst with Telvent in Omaha. If the reserve estimate is accurate, it means backup supplies could be higher this year and next. That would ease fears of a shortage.

Still, in August corn reserves are expected to hit their lowest level since 1995, according to the most recent department estimate. Global demand from ethanol producers and livestock owners has risen faster than farmers’ production over the last decade.

Higher corn prices make soybeans and wheat more expensive because farmers plant less of them.

Raised expectations for this fall’s corn crop also helped lower soybean prices in trading on Thursday. Soybeans fell 29 cents to $12.94 a bushel.

A bigger crop doesn’t guarantee lower food prices. A drought or flood could limit the size of the harvested crop.

Mr. Ward said many of the acres planted this spring were on marginal land that would not yield much grain.

Corn is a key ingredient in feed for poultry and livestock, and a staple in many processed foods. When corn prices rise, food processors and grocers pass along the higher costs to the consumer.

Surging corn and soybean prices are showing up at the grocery store this year.

In May, a sirloin steak cost about 7 percent more than last year, according to the most recent available Bureau of Labor Statistics figures. The price of pork chops jumped 9 percent. The price of spaghetti and macaroni noodles, which often contain soybean meal and corn syrup, jumped 13 percent.
22 2011-07-01 Three chief executives and two stock promoters were charged Thursday in federal court with engaging in fraudulent penny stock schemes, federal investigators said Thursday.

The Justice Department said the executives charged included Donald W. Klein, 40, of the KCM Holdings Corporation; Douglas Newton, 66, of the Real American Capital Corporation; and Thomas Schroepfer, 54, of Smokefree Innotec Inc.

Also charged were Charles Fuentes, 66, accused of promoting Smokefree stock; and Brian Gibson, 63, accused of promoting stock of Xtreme Motorsports International Inc.

Each defendant was charged with conspiracy to defraud the investing public and faces a maximum of five years in prison and fines.

The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil fraud charges against the defendants. The charges were brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
23 2011-07-01 Smartphones could make a more compelling study. More than a third are now powered by Google’s Android, according to comScore, and the number is growing quickly. Applications are a potential way to lock in consumers. Withholding the system’s latest version from handset makers that favor a rival’s services could be a potent stick for Google to wield.

Though the Microsoft case was simpler, it still took more than a decade to resolve. And the most important result was the company pledging restraint. The Google inquiry could uncover most anything, but for now the tortuous path and the end result are starting to seem like the real kinship with Microsoft.

Rupert Murdoch’s experience with MySpace should inspire him to focus on his space. Mercifully for shareholders, the media mogul’s failed six-year experiment in social networking ended on Wednesday, with the News Corporation’s sale of the Web site for $35 million, a fraction of its original price. The deal serves as a pointed reminder of the News Corporation’s poor uses of capital of late. Big TV is where the company’s resources are best allocated.

Mr. Murdoch’s tabloid sensibilities mean he knows a hot story when he sees one. Investing $580 million in MySpace in 2005, when Facebook was still in its infancy, looks outrageous only in hindsight. But not long after the News Corporation took control, the site began its rapid descent.

Multiple high-profile bosses couldn’t set a sensible strategic direction for MySpace as Facebook crushed its rival. Mr. Murdoch’s expensive attempt to jump on the iPad bandwagon, the much-ballyhooed electronic magazine The Daily, so far looks like a dud, too.

Mr. Murdoch’s zeal for newspapers hasn’t helped either. He paid $5 billion in 2007 for Dow Jones, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal, only to write it down to roughly $3 billion about a year later.

Worse, Mr. Murdoch surrendered his stake in the satellite TV operator DirecTV in 2006 in exchange for the stake in the News Corporation owned by the cable mogul John Malone, who might have obstructed his pursuit of Dow Jones.

Though the News Corporation booked nearly a $5 billion gain on DirecTV, the company’s shares have more than tripled in the last five years, while the News Corporation’s shed 13 percent.

DirecTV was an especially big loss because its business is central to what the News Corporation does best. Its British and Italian satellite TV businesses have performed well. And with rare exceptions like the Fox Business Network, Mr. Murdoch has proved a master at producing television programming in the United States. “American Idol” has been a hit for nearly a decade, and the Fox News Channel remains a huge money-spinner.

But even at 80, Mr. Murdoch is chasing something new. He has hired the former head of the New York City public school system to start up an education division, so it’s not obvious that he has learned the lessons of misplaced endeavors like MySpace.
24 2011-07-01 At a time of great economic anxiety, the case raises questions about the federal government’s role in promoting — or impeding — corporate investment and job creation.

Facing so much heat, Mr. Obama said on Wednesday that he did not want to discuss details of the case because the N.L.R.B. was an independent agency.

However, “as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate,” he said. “We can’t afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when we’re competing against and and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world.”

Business and government leaders in the South argue that the labor board is undermining Boeing’s competitive advantage, and they are particularly incensed that officials seem to be favoring unionized workers and plants.

“This is a huge issue because economic development in the South has really been accelerated by the growth of nonunion plants,” said Merle Black, a political science professor at . “This case directly threatens the Southern model of economic development.”

For South Carolina, the Boeing plant means far more than just the thousands of jobs it will create directly and indirectly. Boeing is a marquee company, and state leaders hope its presence will help erase South Carolina’s lingering image as an industrial backwater.

“Boeing was a dream come true for South Carolina,” said Gov. Nikki R. Haley in an interview. “They came in and brought the hope of the American dream to this state to create real, good-quality jobs.”

Those kinds of jobs are hard to come by in the area.

“Everybody I talk to here is excited about this plant,” said one worker, Wayne Gravot. On a recent day at the plant, which is the size of 12 football fields, he and five co-workers were practicing drilling through carbon fiber — a lightweight composite material, as hard as metal, used for much of the Dreamliner’s body.

“It’s a good job, a secure job,” said Mr. Gravot, 45, an Air Force veteran and father of two. Not long ago, he was laid off from a medical devices company and he does not want to end up unemployed again.

The outcome of the case may not be certain for years, as it winds through N.L.R.B. proceedings and likely court appeals. If Boeing loses, it could be ordered to move its three-a-month Dreamliner assembly line from South Carolina to Washington State.

As Ms. Haley and South Carolina’s members of Congress see it, federal bureaucrats have no right to snatch away the state’s prize or tell a global company where to locate a factory.

Like many Republicans, Ms. Haley holds President Obama responsible. “He didn’t just slap South Carolina, he slapped a great company that chose to do business here,” she said. “The president talks about doing something to create jobs — that’s the last thing he’s doing here.”

Board officials say that they have never discussed the case with the White House.

Increasing the sense of disbelief for many here in South Carolina, the board filed the case just as the new plant was nearly completed. Production is scheduled to begin in mid-July.

The case stems from a complaint the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Engineers filed last year, asserting that Boeing was illegally retaliating against its members in Washington State for exercising their right to strike. Those workers have gone on strike five times since 1977, including a 58-day walkout in 2008.

Christopher Corson, the machinists’ general counsel, said, “Boeing broke the law, and there are consequences when someone breaks the law.”

Boeing officials deny violating any labor laws, saying that the main reason they chose South Carolina was to lower production costs. On Thursday, an administrative law judge in Seattle denied Boeing’s request to dismiss the case.

Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the machinists, said the union was not seeking to shut down the South Carolina plant. In its settlement negotiations with Boeing, the union has suggested that the company keep the plant operating by moving some outsourced parts production from other countries to South Carolina — an idea that Boeing and industry analysts consider unrealistic.

For the machinists, the stakes are high. They fear that if Dreamliner production is allowed to go forward in South Carolina, then much of Boeing’s future expansion will take place there.

For South Carolina, battered by the closing of textile mills and furniture factories, the plant is equally vital.

“These things come along at best once a decade,” said Douglas P. Woodward, an economics professor at the . “It’s as big as anything that’s happened to South Carolina since .”

Indeed, BMW opened near Spartanburg in 1994, with 1,200 workers. Since then, employment has expanded to 7,000, and officials say the factory has produced 21,000 spinoff jobs. South Carolinians are hoping for a similar trajectory with Boeing.

“If Boeing takes off, South Carolina will soar with it,” Professor Woodward said.
25 2011-07-01 As for those much more important things, Svoboda said Jagr would not make a decision before Thursday night, “but maybe tomorrow or the day after.” He confirmed that he and Jagr were talking to Pittsburgh and Detroit “and some other teams,” although Svoboda declined to identify those teams.

¶ There was more confusion in Nashville, where the Predators may have accidentally allowed forwards Matt Halischuk, Sergei Kostitsyn and Nick Spaling, along with four minor leaguers, to become unqualified free agents.

The players union filed a grievance on behalf of the players, all of whom were awaiting mandatory qualifying offers, saying that the team did not relay the offers in a timely fashion. The Predators reportedly sent the offers via express delivery rather than by fax, delaying their arrival until after the 5 p.m. Monday deadline.

An arbitrator will rule on the grievance Friday morning.

In the meantime, the Predators bought out the contract of forward J. P. Dumont, who scored 66, 72 and 65 points in his first three seasons in Nashville but only 45 and 19 in the last two.

Dumont becomes an unqualified free agent alongside other players bought out Thursday: the defenseman and slap-shot specialist Sheldon Souray (Edmonton), defenseman Tyler Sloan (Washington), defenseman Mike Commodore (Columbus) and defenseman Cam Barker (Minnesota).

¶ More confusion, this time in Minnesota, where the free-agent forward Andrew Brunette, 37, fired his agents, Todd and Don Reynolds, earlier this week. The firing was reported to be in response to Don Reynolds’s sending a Twitter message expressing his disappointment over Sean Avery’s “misguided support of same-gender ‘marriage.’ ”

But Reynolds’s disdain for Avery’s public support for the legalization of gay marriage in New York (which included a visit to legislators in Albany) turned out not to be the reason for the firing, Brunette said Wednesday.

He told The St. Paul Pioneer-Press he “did not fire Reynolds because of comments on marriage,” although he did not give a reason. Brunette is now represented by Don Baizley.

¶ The former Vancouver defenseman Christian Ehrhoff, who would have become an unrestricted free agent on Friday, agreed to an offer from Buffalo on Thursday night. Ehrhoff is the second veteran defenseman headed to free agency who agreed this week to go to the Sabres, who are suddenly a player in the N.H.L. under the leadership of their new owner, Terry Pegula.

The Canucks traded Ehrhoff’s negotiating rights to the Islanders earlier this week, but he quickly turned down their offer and the Islanders then traded his negotiating rights to Buffalo. Earlier this week, the 11-year Calgary defenseman Robyn Regehr agreed to a trade to Buffalo after being won over by testimony from his former teammate Jordan Leopold, who told him the Sabres under Pegula are on the way up. Pegula and his wife later flew to Saskatchewan to visit with Regehr.

Ehrhoff was one of the most coveted free agents on the market, but his performance in the playoffs — he was minus-13 for a team that made the Stanley Cup finals, a dismal mark even if he was playing with a shoulder injury — could have driven down his value.

Initial reports put the Sabres’ signing of Ehrhoff at 10 years and $40 million

¶ No new news Thursday on the biggest free-agent prize, the former Dallas center Brad Richards, whose top suitors are the Rangers and Tampa Bay.

But now a new factor could be clouding the Richards picture, at least as far as the Lightning are concerned: Tampa Bay center Steven Stamkos.

Stamkos, 21, is a restricted free agent and can entertain offers, any of which the Lightning can match within seven days. Those offers can go as high as $12.86 million per year under the current collective bargaining agreement, a not entirely absurd amount for a young center who is already considered one of the best in the game.

Whether or not an offer in excess of, say, $9 million a year is made to Stamkos would help determine whether Tampa Bay has the cap space to tender Richards an offer.

If Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman is compelled to match a high offer for Stamkos, the cap space it would use could prevent Yzerman from making an offer for the 31-year-old Richards.
26 2011-07-01 AS the United States celebrates the Fourth of July, perhaps we English finally should let you in on a little secret. You didn’t quite win total independence: we left behind a covert occupation force, in the shape of our weeds, which rapidly became your weeds, pesky and persistent.

They came as stowaways in those first shiploads of cattle and seed corn and none-too-hygienic European settlers. The New World’s ancient landscapes, unused to gung-ho farmers and trampling cattle, didn’t stand a chance. As East Coast forests were cleared, a riot of foreign weeds — dandelion, groundsel, dock — took over, promptly followed by European grasses. It came as a shock to me to discover that Kentucky bluegrass — which I’d thought as American as the haze over the Appalachians — was none other than our backyard meadow grass, which assuredly never looks blue under our gray skies.

While we’re at it, I should apologize for our Charles Darwin, who made a joke in rather poor taste at the expense of his friend the American botanist Asa Gray. “Does it not hurt your Yankee pride,” he asked, “that we thrash you so confoundedly? I am sure Mrs. Gray will stick up for your weeds. Ask her if they are not more honest, downright good sort of weeds.” (Mrs. Gray’s reply was impeccable: American weeds, she said, were “modest, woodland, retiring things; and no match for the intrusive, pretentious, self-asserting foreigners.”)

But this intrusive colonialism is of course the weeds’ way. They wouldn’t be the plants they are if they were not assertive, hugely adaptable, cosmopolitan. They’ve tagged onto the coattails of global trade, agricultural adventure and gardening fashion, so that there is no real sense in which a weed can be said anymore to “belong” to any one nation. They are citizens of the world — or at least of the world of frenzied environmental disturbance that humans spin around themselves. I find it oddly comforting to see familiar home weeds like bindweed and bracken in Manhattan back lots. Perhaps Americans feel similarly pleased to find North American fleabane (whose seeds are thought to have ended up in Europe inside a stuffed bird) flourishing on the stonework around the Bank of England. The commonest city weeds are now virtually identical across the planet. They seem to have the botanical right stuff for urban environments: streetwise and opportunistic, resilient fillers of metropolitan dead spaces.

But it would be stretching our “special relationship” too far to suggest that our shared weeds make up a kind of agreeable green commonwealth. Vagabond plants can change their behavior dramatically when taken away from their native habitats, and all their traditional predators and constraints. In Britain the magenta sprays of purple loosestrife have made it one of our best-loved riverside flowers. It’s elegant and well behaved and knows its place. It figures in the margins of John Everett Millais’s unforgettable painting of a floating Ophelia, Hamlet’s rejected love interest, before she drowns. But it was inadvertently introduced to United States shorelines with dumped ships’ ballast in the early 19th century and has become quite a different character, monolithic and invasive.

This is not, of course, the fault of the weeds. From the Japanese knotweed that jumped the walls of big country houses to become Britain’s most notorious plant demon to the casually ditched aquarium plants now suffocating Florida’s lakes and rivers, we create our own weed nuisances. This has been true since the very beginnings of civilization. We’ve opened opportunities for a whole range of adaptable plant species to gate-crash our ordered lives by the reckless way we treat the earth. It’s time, I think, for a new perspective on them, for a curiosity about why they are there and a more critical view of our own role in their fortunes.
27 2011-07-01 However, in his ruling dismissing the Minnesota case, Judge Gregg E. Johnson of the state’s Second Judicial District Court wrote that the retirees in that state “have not met their burden to show unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Judge Robert S. Hyatt, a district judge in Denver, offered a different line of thinking, noting that the 2010 state law that cut the benefits did not actually allow the state to remove money from the pension fund and use it to balance the budget.

Rather, he wrote, the law required the state to send even more money to the pension fund at the same time that it required retirees to give up part of their benefit, “in order to create a larger pool of investable funds and thus provide for sustainable pension benefits in the future.”

He also drew a distinction between a base pension and a cost-of-living adjustment, often called a COLA. He suggested that the inflation adjustment could be reduced, but the base pension could not.

William T. Payne, a lawyer in Pittsburgh whose firm represented the retirees in both cases, said his clients were studying their options and might appeal.

Another lawyer at the firm, Stephen M. Pincus, said in a statement: “Under the courts’ reasoning, the legislatures could eliminate the entire COLA and the retirees would have no recourse.”

There has not yet been a decision in a third lawsuit challenging a cost-of-living adjustment cutback in South Dakota.

The three cases have been closely watched as bellwethers. Many states and cities have been trying to rein in the cost of their pension systems, but the easiest changes — like closing the pension plans to new members and making fixed contributions to 401(k) accounts instead — can take decades to produce any savings. Cuts in COLAs, by contrast, produce big savings immediately.

Mr. Pincus said it was not clear whether the two new rulings would affect the thinking of officials in other states. “Trial court decisions are not binding on courts in their own states, let alone other states,” he said. He added that appellate courts in other states, including California and West Virginia, had found that cost-of-living adjustments could not be reduced.

Cost-of-living adjustments are found primarily in the public sector, and in the past, states and cities have prided themselves on the practice of shielding their retirees from inflation. Very few companies offer pensions with cost-of-living adjustments. Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, but the adjustments can go both up and down.

Ever since the stock market crash of 2008 wiped out many people’s retirement savings, officials have had a hard time persuading taxpayers of the virtues of covering the cost of inflation-adjusted pensions, which typical taxpayers no longer get themselves.
28 2011-07-01 “It’s not always just the guy pulling the trigger who is guilty,” said Tom Foley, a retired state police commander who pursued Mr. Bulger with Ahab-like intensity for years, only to see him elude capture thanks to help from his F.B.I. friends. “It’s also the people who set that up and allowed it to happen, and especially the people who had a responsibility to put a stop to it.”

Even if Mr. Bulger, 81, decides to talk, it is not clear that he has much to bargain with: he stands accused of 19 murders, and some of his closest associates have implicated him. The statute of limitations has passed for most crimes he could talk about, and most former investigators are retired or dead. But former F.B.I. agents and lawyers connected to the case say that Mr. Bulger may decide that he wants to settle a few scores.

For much of the 1980s, he turned the world of Boston law enforcement upside down.

The F.B.I. considered him and his partner “top echelon” informants, but the pair seemed to get more from the bureau than they gave. Federal agents helped them by locking up rivals, protected them from other investigators and tipped them off when witnesses threatened to implicate them. Those would-be witnesses quickly wound up dead, sometimes with their teeth removed to make it harder to identify the bodies.

In those days it was not just the lawmen who referred to the gangsters with colorful nicknames like Whitey and the Rifleman. Mr. Bulger had his own nicknames for the F.B.I. agents he wined and dined and used, associates testified: Zip, Agent Orange, The Pipe, Doc and Vino.

John Connolly was the F.B.I. agent who handled both Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi, using their information to build high-profile cases against the Mafia. Mr. Bulger called him Zip because they came from the same South Boston housing project and had shared a ZIP code. But Mr. Connolly grew too close to his source. He was convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice in 2002, in part for tipping Mr. Bulger off in 1994 when he was finally about to be indicted. Then he was convicted of second-degree murder in 2008 for warning Mr. Bulger in 1982 that a man named John Callahan was likely to implicate him in several murders connected with an attempt to profit from World Jai Alai, a company with frontons in and . Mr. Callahan’s body was found in the trunk of a car at Miami International Airport, after an attendant noticed blood dripping from it.

A lawyer for Mr. Connolly, James E. McDonald, said that Mr. Bulger’s capture could stir things up. “If I were the Department of Justice prosecutors, I’d be nervous, because if Bulger starts to talk, the whole edifice they have created about John being the corrupt agent will have holes you could drive a truck through,” he said.

Mr. Connolly did not act alone.

His supervisor at the F.B.I., John Morris, called Vino, admitted to taking $7,000 in bribes from Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi — beginning when he asked them to pay for his mistress to fly to a training session he was attending in . Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi took to calling him Vino after a 1981 dinner at the Hotel Colonnade in Boston, where he drank a great deal of wine. They later sent him a case, with $1,000 in it. But Mr. Morris was granted when he agreed to cooperate with the government.

Still, he may have the most to fear. Mr. Morris admitted that in 1988 he leaked information to the , which has long done ground-breaking reporting on the Bulger saga, that Mr. Bulger was an F.B.I. informant. His lawyer, Michael A. Collora, said that Mr. Morris did so in the hopes that exposing the troubled relationship would end it. But Mr. Bulger’s brother , a former president of the State Senate, saw a more sinister motive. He testified before Congress in 2003 that the leak’s purpose was “bringing about the death of James Bulger.”

After Whitey Bulger became a fugitive, he called Mr. Morris with a threat: he vowed to take Mr. Morris with him if he went down. But Mr. Collora noted in an interview this week that Mr. Morris, who he said worked part-time at a wine store, had already admitted wrongdoing and had been granted immunity. The statute of limitations has run its course for most crimes, he said, and there are serious questions about what kind of witness Mr. Bulger would make. “A situation where you have a man who’s been on the lam for 16 years, who says now I’ll help you out, even though he’s done 19 murders?” he asked.

One memo that has received little scrutiny shows how officials in Washington were warned that the F.B.I.’s Boston office was too close to Mr. Bulger. It was written in 1982, after the jai alai murders were linked to Mr. Bulger’s group, known as the Winter Hill Gang. An agent in the office warned officials in Washington that local investigators were cutting the F.B.I. out of the loop, in part because they believed “that some agents in the Boston F.B.I. would not pursue allegations against the Winter Hill Gang vigorously.” Sean M. McWeeney, who was in charge of the bureau’s organized crime section, wrote that he held meetings in Washington and Tulsa, Okla., to reassure local investigators.

It took two decades for the full story to get out — including Mr. Connolly’s role in the murders.

John McIntyre was another witness who never made it to the stand. He was a 32-year-old fisherman who agreed to cooperate with investigators in 1984 about Mr. Bulger’s involvement in drug and gun shipments. Tipped that there was an informer, Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi chained Mr. McIntyre to a chair and made him confess. They then tried to strangle him with a rope, and when that did not work, Mr. Flemmi testified, they shot him and removed his teeth.

A federal judge awarded Mr. McIntyre’s estate $3.1 million, finding that the federal government was liable for his death because Mr. Connolly had leaked Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi enough information for them to identify him as an informer. Steven Gordon, the , N.H., lawyer who represented the estate, said the government’s defense showed a continued refusal to come clean. “They allowed a whole city to come under siege,” he said.

When Mr. Bulger fled, some joked that he should be on the F.B.I.’s “least wanted” list. In a 1999 ruling after hearings that helped expose the F.B.I.’s dealings with Mr. Bulger, a Federal Court judge, Mark L. Wolf, cited evidence that “raises questions concerning whether the F.B.I. has consistently made its best efforts to apprehend” him. He noted that agents waited 15 months before approaching Theresa Stanley, the first girlfriend Mr. Bulger fled with, who returned to Boston in 1995 because she disliked life on the road. Judge Wolf began his decision with a quotation by Lord Acton, who wrote in 1861 that “every thing secret degenerates, even the administration of justice.”

“This case,” the judge wrote, “demonstrates that he was right.”
29 2011-07-01 Even after all these years since the spotted owl became the cause célèbre of the environmental movement, it is far from clear that the plan is a solution. Advocates on both sides say it will inevitably be challenged, and both sides have expressed frustration with the Obama administration on the issue.

Some contentious points have still not been addressed, including precisely mapping the so-called critical habitat to be protected. And some experts say that while two decades of protections for the owl have helped preserve forest ecosystems, they are less certain that the bird itself can still be saved.

The spotted owl is declining by an average of 3 percent per year across its range. While some populations in Southern Oregon and Northern California are more stable, some of the steepest rates of decline are here in Washington. Some study areas in the Olympic and Cascade ranges show annual declines as high as 9 percent.

“I’ve certainly become much less confident as the years have gone by,” said Eric Forsman, a research biologist with the United States Forest Service in Corvallis, Ore., whose work in the 1970s first drew attention to the owl. “If you’d asked me in 1975, ‘Can we fix this problem?’, I’d have said, ‘Oh yeah, this problem will go away.’ ”

The listing of the spotted owl as a threatened species led to a virtual ban on logging in many older federal forests, inspiring angry lawsuits and threats of violence by rural loggers against owl advocates, who often came from urban areas.

“We were trained not to tell people in the local towns that we were surveying spotted owls,” said Paula Swedeen, a government owl surveyor in the early 1990s who now works for a nonprofit group that develops incentives for private forest owners to retain and restore owl habitat.

Yet over time, the public passion and the owl both faded.

Even as unemployment in some timber counties routinely rises into double digits, there are no longer presidential Timber Conferences, like the one Bill Clinton held in Oregon in 1993 seeking middle ground between conservation and protecting rural economies. Many factors contribute to rural declines, but logging restrictions played a role.

“Nothing against the bird, but it’s wreaked a lot of havoc in the Pacific Northwest for the past 20 years,” said Ray Wilkeson, president of the Oregon Forest Industries Council, which represents loggers, sawmills and others in the industry. “A lot of human suffering has resulted from this. Now there’s new threats to the owl that may be beyond anybody’s ability to control.”

The barred owl, a bigger, more adaptable bird with a broader diet than the flying squirrels and the wood rats that spotted owls prefer, has expanded its range westward in the past century, and it is now a more common resident than spotted owls in many Northwest forests. Sometimes barred owls even kill male spotted owls and mate with females.

“The barred owl is the most imminent challenge,” said Paul Henson, the Fish and Wildlife Service’s team leader for the recovery plan. “We believe there is a very good chance of recovering the spotted owl in the long term if we can manage the barred owl issue in the short term.”

Others are less sure. While some early experiments showed success, Dr. Forsman, the Forest Service biologist, questions whether barred owls could be managed on a broad scale, if it came to that.

“You would have to shoot barred owls forever to do that,” he said, “and I don’t think that’s likely to happen.”

The plan’s supporters say it provides for studies that may reveal ways to manage forests to create space for both birds.

Although the plan does not map critical habitat — the mapping process is more than a year away from completion, a fact that frustrates conservationists — it proposes expanding protections for owls beyond areas currently set aside. The existing areas were outlined by the Northwest Forest Plan, which was approved a year after President Clinton’s Timber Conference, revised under President George W. Bush to allow more logging and reinstated by the Obama administration.

The American Forest Resource Council, a timber industry group, said the plan would impose “massive new restrictions on both federal and private lands.”

But supporters say it will provide more wood for mills by increasing forest thinning and restoration work to battle threats like disease and fire that could increase with climate change. The plan would provide timber companies incentives to create potential spotted owl habitat. Officials from the Forest Service and from the Bureau of Land Management, which oversee logging on federal land, expressed support for the plan.

“Thinning opportunity, that’s what’s always offered up to us as an alleged middle ground,” said Mr. Wilkeson of the Oregon Forest Industries Council. “But it’s pretty limited.”

While timber advocates question protections for a bird that some say may be bound for extinction, conservationists say that it is too soon to give up on the spotted owl, and that the fight to save it has served broader benefits of the forest, from cleaner water and air to habitat for hundreds of other species, including endangered salmon.

“The spotted owl is the icon,” Dr. Forsman said, “but there are a lot of other players in terms of species and protecting biodiversity in these forests.”
30 2011-07-01 RUJBAN, Libya — The people fleeing Tripoli on Thursday said that several neighborhoods filled with the sound of gunfire every night. At checkpoints throughout the capital, they said, paramilitaries from the dreaded People’s Guard carried long lists of wanted men. The gas lines were five days long.

The refugees say that Tripoli’s rebels defiantly paint their flags on anything that will spread their message, including pigeons, cats and balloons.

In the last week, hundreds of families fleeing Tripoli have arrived at a rebel checkpoint here in the middle of a winding mountain road, exhausted, relieved and willing to share their stories of a silenced city. Their numbers — more than a hundred families on a recent day alone — suggest a quickening exodus from the capital, fueled by a growing sense of dread, rebels say, and a willingness to brave a dangerous road in order to flee.

“Tripoli is not stable,” said Ali Mohammed Rahaybi, 44, who fled Janzur, on Tripoli’s western outskirts, to join relatives who live in the Nafusah Mountains. He said he saw signs of resistance to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s rule everywhere: in graffiti on schools, at occasional demonstrations, and in the flags drawn on neighborhood walls.

“The revolutionaries are doing their duty,” he said.

The sudden surge of traffic at this checkpoint comes as the Nafusah rebels try to consolidate their hold on towns in the region in battles on at least three fronts. On Thursday, rebel soldiers came under intense shelling in the abandoned town of Kiklah, which is controlled by Colonel Qaddafi’s opponents but is surrounded by his soldiers.

And outside Bir al-Ghanem, on a road that leads to the oil city of Zawiya, the rebels said they were kept from advancing on Thursday by barrages of enemy rocket fire. At a checkpoint in the nearby town of Bir Ayad, rebels guarding a checkpoint scanned radio frequencies for news, happening upon a message broadcast by NATO.

In English, an American voice said: “To the soldiers of the Libyan army: Qaddafi has lost the right to give you orders, having been accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity in Libya. This is a huge relief for you, as there is no legal or moral reason to obey his orders.” The message was also broadcast in Arabic.

The checkpoint in Rujban opened in early June after rebel fighters, mostly local men, routed Colonel Qaddafi’s soldiers in the town of Qasr al-Hajj, which sits at the foot of the mountain. Men with Kalashnikovs guard the checkpoint around the clock, sleeping in a white trailer equipped with thin mattresses in one room and a hot pot in another. They hide from the midday sun on a mat underneath the trailer.

They register the names of the refugees in a ledger that was once an electric company’s complaint book. Tuesday was the busiest day yet, with 130 families registered in the book. Fridays are also busy, and most mornings: those trying to escape Tripoli often leave at sunrise, hoping to catch checkpoint guards sleeping.

Not everyone who passes here is fleeing. Some families, including several from a mountain village that is still loyal to Colonel Qaddafi, travel back and forth to Tripoli regularly. As a red car went through the checkpoint, headed to the capital, the guards refused to greet the driver and his wife. “He’s with Qaddafi,” one of the rebels said.

By 10 a.m. on Thursday, there were 36 families registered in the logbook, almost all of them from Tripoli. Families arrived in taxis, the cabs of 18-wheelers and in a refrigerated truck, stocked with bread for the journey. Most were too afraid to give their full names, saying they worried for relatives still in Tripoli. Almost all said they had lied about where they were going, telling soldiers at checkpoints they were headed to towns controlled by government troops or loyal to Colonel Qaddafi, rather than to the rebellious mountaintop cities.

One man said that after bombings by NATO warplanes, people can often be heard whistling from the rooftops, taunting the Qaddafi soldiers. They respond with gunfire aimed toward the sky, he said.
31 2011-07-01 In the course of her investigation, it becomes clear that things are — cue the “Law & Order” deadbolt clang — more complicated than they seemed. The credulous, well-meaning older boy, Brian, says he committed the assault under orders from shadowy figures with whom he would chat on the Internet.

Strangely enough, he is telling the truth, but it is gradually revealed that the whole thing has actually been orchestrated by the younger boy, Jake, who played the entire cast of goading characters, seducing and maddening Brian to incite his own murder. Jake wanted, it seems, the same things people have always wanted from the Internet: sexual excitement, a cure for loneliness, to experiment with different personalities. “To be loved,” the chorus adds at the end. “To be remembered.”

Without using electronic instruments, Mr. Muhly has created a world immersed in technology; his sound palette is Britten, not “Tron.” There are softly chiming gongs and ethereal winds, lyrical and sinuous strings and sympathetic, Romantic orchestral surges. The second act starts with an eerie, suspended calm punctured by string flourishes that develop into something almost folksy. There are foreboding minor-key arpeggios throughout, but Mr. Muhly ventures far beyond stock Minimalism. He even creates a new setting for part of the Anglican service; the sound of church music, dense yet floating, permeates the opera.

Indeed, the choral writing is the work’s most successful element. Touches of old-fashioned ornamentation have been added to Strawson’s straightforward lines to emphasize how technologically primitive she is. (“What’s a server?” she asks at one point.) Brian is given to excited exhortations.

But the solo lines in general blend together, highlighting the cipherish aspect of the opera’s characterizations. Strawson is stereotypically hard-bitten and secretly lonely; Brian is resolutely, utterly ordinary. The plot unfolds, but no one really learns anything or changes. Despite a committed cast (with standout performances by Susan Bickley as Strawson and Nicky Spence as Brian), it is the plot that sweeps us forward, not the characters. The opera’s resistance to neat, redemptive arcs is brave, but something is missing. We know the fact of Jake’s desperate loneliness, for instance, but we never feel its, or his, individuality.

This is partly a result of Mr. Sher’s efficient but faceless production. The scenes shift with cinematic ease: a conversation that begins in Brian’s bedroom might end seamlessly in Strawson’s office.

The projections on the looming walls, which help create spaces both real and abstract, are sometimes thrilling, with heart-pounding use of the “footage” from the crime scene. But the choral interludes are illustrated by images out of an AT&T commercial, networks of light forming and disintegrating. Giant blowups of computer printouts blur and recede risibly during Strawson’s detective work. And Mr. Sher has those stylized projections awkwardly share space with realistic furniture that actors are continually required to move.

Mr. Sher’s production is at its weakest in one of the opera’s crucial scenes, in which Jake arrives in Brian’s bedroom to proposition him. The blocking is dull and uncertain, with much of the action obscured by a desk. Since the scene’s complex mix of emotions — disgust, shame, love — motivates the climax of the opera, our lack of a clear sense of what has happened lessens the work’s eventual impact and our sense of these characters as people.

That so much emotion remains is largely because of Mr. Muhly, whose music is suffused with feeling and free of moral judgments. It is odd that the English National Opera has billed “Two Boys” as a “cautionary tale” about the Internet, when the opera represents online life more ambiguously, as a space of utter possibility, and Jake’s plot as a creative act. He plans to die, hoping that “everyone will say what a beautiful voice I had.”

That is the wish of any artist. In his program biography Mr. Muhly describes himself as “a former boy chorister”; it can’t be coincidence that Jake, too, is a choirboy and, like Mr. Muhly, a prodigy who loves to interact on his computer. Jake’s mother could be referring to Mr. Muhly when she describes her son: “He’s more grown-up than anyone I know.”

The opera derives much of its power from this intensely personal quality. “Two Boys” has much to do with being an artist — an individual — and the way society makes it possible (and impossible) to create, showing the disturbing roads creativity can travel. Its characters could perhaps be more vividly drawn, its production clearer, but it richly fulfills the promise of opera: an entertainment of ideas. For once, you leave the theater talking not about whether the soprano has hit her high notes but about a work’s themes, its relevance to our lives.

Serious and radiant, “Two Boys” is a landmark in the career of an important artist. Confidently staking his claim to the operatic tradition, Mr. Muhly has added to it a work of dark beauty.

38 2011-07-02 Although Buchholz did experience some discomfort in his shoulder, the Mets notified Major League Baseball that he was simultaneously experiencing anxiety and depression, for which he was entered into the employee assistance program.

Buchholz, who was signed a one-year, $600,000 deal in January, has a 3.12 E.R.A. in 23 games, including eight games finished.

STEP FORWARD FOR SANTANA Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ general manager, said that the left-handed starter Johan Santana, who is rehabilitating his left shoulder after surgery last September, threw off a mound Wednesday for the first time since June 3, when he experienced discomfort.

Alderson said that Santana did not experience any discomfort Friday. If he is able to do that again, the Mets hope to then start what would roughly replicate a six-week spring training. At best, that would bring Santana back in the middle of August. But, as the Mets continually point out, Santana is dictating his own schedule, so there is no set time timetable on his return, or any guarantee that he will be back at all this season.

HARRIS BACK SUNDAY Willie Harris, who is on bereavement leave, will return Sunday, Terry Collins said.

AN EXTRA STARTER? Phil Hughes threw a bullpen session Friday, as he typically would in preparation for his next start. He just does not know when or where that next start will be.

Hughes, who is recovering from shoulder inflammation, last pitched Wednesday for Class AA Trenton and he could make one more minor league start before coming off the disabled list, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said. Then again, he might pitch in the majors, too.

“Do we want to give him one more start in the minor leagues to build him up even further or do we feel that he is ready to go?” Girardi said. “That’s the determination we have to make in the next couple of days.”

Girardi indicated that Hughes’s status could be affected by how Bartolo Colon comes through Saturday’s game. Colon will be making his first start since straining a hamstring June 11.

Juggling the rotation could get tricky for the Yankees once Hughes and Colon are healthy, as they will join C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, Freddy Garcia and Friday’s starter against the Mets, Ivan Nova. Girardi said he would consider using a six-man rotation, although it does not seem likely as a long-term option.

Nova would seem like the most likely one to be bumped from the rotation if the Yankees decide to stick with five starters, but Girardi and General Manager Brian Cashman said Nova was not pitching to keep his spot in the series opener against the Mets. Garcia, Sabathia, Burnett and Nova are listed as the Yankees’ probable starters for Sunday through Wednesday, but Hughes’s could change that.

“They’re ‘probables,’ ” Girardi said. “Our starters are not etched in stone.” SAM BORDEN

REHAB START NEXT FOR JETER Derek Jeter had his final workout in Tampa, Fla., rained out Friday, but he is expected to play in his first rehabilitation game Saturday for Class AA Trenton. Jeter had his pursuit of 3,000 career hits halted at 2,994 when he hurt his right calf June 14, and his teammates are eager to see him resume the chase.

If all goes well Saturday and Sunday in Trenton, Jeter could rejoin the Yankees on Monday in Cleveland.

“We’re looking forward to his arrival and also celebrating his 3,000th hit,” Alex Rodriguez said. “It’s going to be pretty cool.”

Rodriguez was less talkative about reports linking him to a high-stakes Hollywood poker game that featured celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. Asked about his involvement, Rodriguez declined comment. In 2005, Rodriguez was warned by Major League Baseball after it was reported that he had played poker at underground clubs in Manhattan.

Brian Cashman said he was unaware of the current situation involving Rodriguez. SAM BORDEN

controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House disagreed on how to resolve the budget deficit of $2.8 billion.

ISSUE Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, would not sign any budget extension unless the Legislature increased the state income tax and expanded the sales tax. Republicans received their demand for changes to teachers’ health insurance.

EFFECT There were layoffs of 35,000 employees and a decrease in state police patrols. Rest stops were barricaded, drawbridges were closed and traffic cameras were turned off.

ISSUE Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, and the Republican-controlled Senate disagreed on several issues. But they eventually reached an agreement on a $27.17 billion package that contained most of his proposals, including an effort to contain health care costs.
41 2011-07-02 A month later he called again. He had cut only 530 words, he was exhausted and would it be an imposition to ask me to come to Cuba to help him?

I did, and over the next nine days I submitted list upon list of suggested cuts. At first he rejected them: “What I’ve written is Proustian in its cumulative effect, and if we eliminate detail we destroy that effect.” But eventually he grudgingly consented to cutting 54,916 words. He was resigned, surrendering, and said he would leave it to Life to cut the rest.

I got on the plane back to New York knowing my friend was “bone-tired and very beat-up,” but thinking he simply needed rest and would soon be his old dominating self again.

In November I went out West for our annual pheasant shoot and realized how wrong I was. When Ernest and our friend Duke MacMullen met my train at Shoshone, Idaho, for the drive to Ketchum, we did not stop at the bar opposite the station as we usually did because Ernest was anxious to get on the road. I asked why the hurry.

“They tailed us all the way. Ask Duke.”

“Well ... there was a car back of us out of Hailey.”

“It’s the worst hell. The goddamnedest hell. They’ve bugged everything. That’s why we’re using Duke’s car. Mine’s bugged. Everything’s bugged. Can’t use the phone. Mail intercepted.”

We rode for miles in silence. As we turned into Ketchum, Ernest said quietly: “Duke, pull over. Cut your lights.” He peered across the street at a bank. Two men were working inside. “What is it?” I asked.

“Auditors. The F.B.I.’s got them going over my account.”

“But how do you know?”

“Why would two auditors be working in the middle of the night? Of course it’s my account.”

All his friends were worried: he had changed; he was depressed; he wouldn’t hunt; he looked bad.

Ernest, Mary and I went to dinner the night before I left. Halfway through the meal Ernest said we had to leave immediately. Mary asked what was wrong.

“Those two F.B.I. agents at the bar, that’s what’s wrong.”

The next day Mary had a private talk with me. She was terribly distraught. Ernest spent hours every day with the manuscript of his Paris sketches — published as “A Moveable Feast” after his death — trying to write but unable to do more than turn its pages. He often spoke of destroying himself and would sometimes stand at the gun rack, holding one of the guns, staring out the window.

On Nov. 30 he was registered under an assumed name in the psychiatric section of St. Mary’s Hospital in Rochester, Minn., where, during December, he was given 11 electric shock treatments.

In January he called me from outside his room. He sounded in control, but his voice held a heartiness that didn’t belong there and his delusions had not changed or diminished. His room was bugged, and the phone was tapped. He suspected that one of the interns was a fed.

During a short release he twice attempted suicide with a gun from the vestibule rack. And on a flight to the Mayo Clinic, though heavily sedated, he tried to jump from the plane. When it stopped in Casper, Wyo., for repairs, he tried to walk into the moving propeller.

I visited him in June. He had been given a new series of shock treatments, but it was as before: the car bugged, his room bugged. I said it very gently: “Papa, why do you want to kill yourself?”

“What do you think happens to a man going on 62 when he realizes that he can never write the books and stories he promised himself? Or do any of the other things he promised himself in the good days?”

“But how can you say that? You have written a beautiful book about Paris, as beautiful as anyone can hope to write.”

“The best of that I wrote before. And now I can’t finish it.”

I told him to relax or even retire.

“Retire?” he said. “Unlike your baseball player and your prizefighter and your matador, how does a writer retire? No one accepts that his legs are shot or the whiplash gone from his reflexes. Everywhere he goes, he hears the same damn question: what are you working on?”

I told him he never cared about those dumb questions.

“What does a man care about? Staying healthy. Working good. Eating and drinking with his friends. Enjoying himself in bed. I haven’t any of them. You understand, goddamn it? None of them.” Then he turned on me. I was just like the others, pumping him for information and selling him out to the feds. After that day, I never saw him again.

This man, who had stood his ground against charging water buffaloes, who had flown missions over Germany, who had refused to accept the prevailing style of writing but, enduring rejection and poverty, had insisted on writing in his own unique way, this man, my deepest friend, was afraid — afraid that the F.B.I. was after him, that his body was disintegrating, that his friends had turned on him, that living was no longer an option.

Decades later, in response to a Freedom of Information petition, the F.B.I. released its Hemingway file. It revealed that beginning in the 1940s J. Edgar Hoover had placed Ernest under surveillance because he was suspicious of Ernest’s activities in Cuba. Over the following years, agents filed reports on him and tapped his phones. The surveillance continued all through his confinement at St. Mary’s Hospital. It is likely that the phone outside his room was tapped after all.

In the years since, I have tried to reconcile Ernest’s fear of the F.B.I., which I regretfully misjudged, with the reality of the F.B.I. file. I now believe he truly sensed the surveillance, and that it substantially contributed to his anguish and his suicide.

I was in Rome the day he died.

I did not go to Ketchum for the funeral. Instead I went to Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, one of his favorite churches, and said goodbye to him there. I recalled a favorite dictum of his: man can be destroyed, but not defeated.
42 2011-07-02 With the use of anonymous sources, unsubstantiated claims and biased experts in its “Drilling Down” series, The New York Times has proved itself to be firmly against the opportunities that clean, domestic, abundant natural gas provides.

“Insiders Sound an Alarm Amid a Natural Gas Rush” (front page, June 26) contradicts the broad scientific consensus of America’s vast natural gas wealth. The robust and attainable supply projections are supported by the federal government, numerous independent analysts, and academic and industry data. This information was provided to your newspaper. Technological advancements, even since 2009, offer vast and reliable natural gas supplies, leading to stable markets.

This American resource benefits our energy security, economy and environment. If your newspaper has an agenda — and it appears it does — it should be disclosed to your readers.

The Times is to be commended for its investigative articles about the claims made by the oil and gas companies about the profitability of natural gas obtained from hydrofracking (injecting water, sand and chemicals to release gas from shale formations). These articles reveal the false basis on which the advocates for natural gas are attracting private investment and government subsidies.

In addition to continuing to call on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York not to allow hydrofracking anywhere in the state, we must also oppose the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions bill (H.R. 1835 and S. 1408, also known as the NAT GAS Act), which would provide tax incentives for converting vehicles to run on natural gas instead of oil.

44 2011-07-02 IS your home worth as much as it was seven years ago? If so, you’ve done better than most Americans.

What is most impressive about the decline in home prices is the ubiquity of the fall and how many years of gains were wiped out. Real estate agents, using some dubious statistics, used to claim that national home prices had never fallen for an entire year, even if there sometimes were regional markets that suffered for a year or two.

The most-followed index of home prices, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller 20-city composite, managed a small rise in April, the first gain after seven months of declines, but it remained at a level first reached in May 2003.

None of the 20 regions — each “city” is actually a collection of metropolitan areas that include suburbs — have prices now that are as high as they were in 2005, as can be seen in the accompanying graphic. Only four of them, New York, Washington, Seattle and Portland, Ore., have prices as high as they were in 2004.

The return of prices to levels seen many years ago has occurred in areas where prices soared during the boom as well as in regions where there seemed to be no bubble in home prices. From the end of 2001 through the end of 2006, prices in the San Francisco region rose 69 percent, far more than the modest 13 percent increase in the Denver area. But prices in both regions are back to where they were in 2001.
45 2011-07-02 This is where private student loans come in — and proceed to send some undergraduates’ total debts spiraling into the six figures by the time they manage to earn a bachelor’s degree. While the government recently introduced lower federal loan payments for graduates with limited income and loan forgiveness for people in public service jobs, the banks don’t have similar programs for their private loan borrowers.

And about this name — private student loans. It’s factually inaccurate. To get the lowest rates, a teenager with limited credit history will need a co-applicant, which usually ends up being a parent.

The vast majority of these loans end up being a joint effort, so let’s call them what they are: private family loans. Yes, banks will often absolve the co-signer of responsibility after a couple of years if every payment has arrived on time, but forgetful young adults don’t always do that. (This, by the way, creates black marks on everyone’s credit history, not just the student’s.)

So here come U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo with their new fixed-rate family loans. Both last for 15 years. The crucial difference is that U.S. Bank offers only one rate: an annual percentage rate of 7.8 percent. An upfront fee can raise the actual annual percentage rate on the loan to as high as 8.46 percent.

Wells Fargo’s fixed-rate loans have no origination fee and are as low as 7.29 percent (or as much as another percentage point lower if you’re a current Wells Fargo banking or education loan customer). But if you don’t have excellent credit, the fixed rate could be high as 14.21 percent for community colleges or trade schools.

The current variable rate ranges from an annual percentage rate of 3.39 to 10.22 percent at U.S. Bank and 3.4 to 11.74 percent at Wells Fargo. Given the size of the gap and no signs that rate increases are imminent, why introduce this option now?

“We think that students and parents are looking for some level of certainty in the long run,” said Lucille Conley, senior vice president of consumer lending for U.S. Bank. “They’ve seen things happen in the housing market that may cause them more concern than they might have had four or five years ago.”

The bankers aren’t suggesting that borrowers actually try to do the math. In fact, it’s nearly impossible. The banks haven’t created calculators that allow you to input a series of interest rate spikes and declines at various points along a 15-year timeline and then compare it with a fixed rate. And since the professionals have no idea themselves what interest rates may do, it makes little sense for them to encourage their customers to guess.

Instead, this is a product for people who sleep better at night knowing what their payment is. Turns out there are lots of people like this. Kirk Bare, Wells Fargo’s business head of education financial services, said the bank was expecting a fairly low adoption of the fixed-rate loan and has been surprised by how many families have chosen it so far.

This is a fine thing, as far as it goes. Fine, that is, until you stop to think about what the mere existence of the private family loan actually means.

Let’s start by repeating the first principle of borrowing for college, one that even lenders now repeat ad nauseam: do not, under any circumstances, take out one of these loans until you have used up all of your federal loan eligibility. Most students can borrow up to $5,500 in their first year as an undergraduate, $6,500 in their second year and $7,500 each year after that until they max out at a total of $31,000.

What if this is not enough? “If you’re bumping up against the federal loan limit, you have to look at it as a sign that you are in over your head in terms of your debt,” said Zac Bissonnette, the author of a book called “Debt-Free U,” who recently graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

It will come as no surprise that lenders aren’t exactly fans of the “any private loan is a loan too large” school of thought. “If you haven’t saved enough to pay for the entire college bill, should you even be going to the first federal loan?” asked Joseph DePaulo, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Sallie Mae, the biggest family education lender.

“You could start the answer anywhere, and I wouldn’t arbitrarily start it at federal loans versus private. I think it goes back to the question of your own comfort level. How much value do you put in the nature of the school you are attending relative to what your goals and objectives are while considering your means?”

Mark Kantrowitz, who runs the encyclopedic college financing Web site finaid.org, which ought to be the first stop for any family seeking to learn more about its options, suggests a middle ground: Do not borrow any more during college than you think your annual salary will be when you graduate. Mr. Bissonnette, however, worries that families may be too optimistic. Plus, teenagers may change their minds a few times during college about their career goals.

All of this would be so much easier if the federal government would lend most people way more than $31,000. If that ever happened, the banks would be out of the business of underwriting undergraduates.

My former colleague at The New York Times, Jonathan D. Glater, now a member of the law school faculty at the University of California, Irvine, set tongues wagging in this world recently with an academic paper that suggested a much higher federal loan limit, among other things. But it’s hard to imagine any big changes in the current political environment.

Many families throw up their hands and borrow whatever the friendliest person in their college’s financial aid office tells them. Keep in mind, however, that these counselors are in the enrollment business, not financial planning.

“Colleges don’t have the guts to go to the extreme of saying that you should go to a less expensive school,” Mr. Kantrowitz said. “If they were to start being realistic and doing that, they would have to stop growing and start shrinking. Their pecuniary interests are pitted against the best interests of students.”

Meanwhile, he added, colleges fall back to a script that goes something like this: “They say, ‘If students are willing to borrow money, who are we to disagree? Maybe they have elasticity that we’re not aware of.’ ”

Elasticity is a pretty good word, actually. If you’re a parent, you need to think hard about just how much you are willing to stretch — and if the debt will break your children if they graduate into an economy anything like this one and you’re not able to help.
46 2011-07-02 Sherlock Holmes had the case of the dog that didn’t bark, but it has taken two dozen apartment complexes and a testing company in Tennessee to bring the art of canine detection into the “CSI” age.

And the evidence is right underfoot.

Canine DNA is now being used to identify the culprits who fail to clean up after their pets, an offense that Deborah Violette, for one, is committed to eradicating at the apartment complex she manages.

Everyone who owns a dog in her complex, Timberwood Commons in Lebanon, N.H., must submit a sample of its DNA, taken by rubbing a cotton swab around inside the animal’s mouth.

The swab is sent to BioPet Vet Lab, a Knoxville, Tenn., company that enters it into a worldwide database. If Ms. Violette finds an unscooped pile, she can take a sample, mail it to Knoxville and use a DNA match to identify the offending owner.

Called PooPrints, the system costs $29.99 for the swabbing kit, $10 for a vial to hold the samples and $50 to analyze them, which usually takes a week or two. The company says that about two dozen apartment complexes around the country have signed up for the service. In 2008, the Israeli city of Petah Tikva created a dog DNA database for the same purpose.
47 2011-07-02 “There’s a lot of concern about whether this is going to be for a weekend or whether it will stretch into August,” said Liz Kuoppala, the executive director of the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless, which, along with a long list of other groups (on behalf of people with , battered women, mentally ill Minnesotans) pleaded on Friday before a retired State Supreme Court justice who has been designated to consider exceptions to the state financing freeze. “Part of the hardest part for people in the homeless shelters and elsewhere,” she said, “is not knowing what’s going to happen and what’s going to be paid for and what’s not.”

In a way, the standstill here may have begun last November, when the voters turned power in St. Paul upside down and picked leaders whose ideas about budgets, even during the campaign, could not have been more different from one another.

Republicans, who took control of both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in almost four decades, called for reining in spending as a way to pull the state’s budget, facing a $5 billion deficit, into control. But Mr. Dayton, who became the state’s first Democratic governor in 20 years, called for collecting more in income from the very highest earners to spare cuts in services to Minnesota’s most vulnerable residents.

As the state’s new budget year approached, the opposing sides had negotiated privately, day after day, under a polite “cone of silence,” in which no one shared a peep about what the other side was asking for.

All vows of silence — and politeness — had vanished by Friday after talks fell apart and Minnesota found itself the only state in the nation closing down. At least 45 states had agreed to spending plans by Friday, officials at the National Conference of State Legislatures said, and the handful of states still finishing their work did not appear at risk of shutdown.

The entire episode left some Minnesotans baffled, posing questions to anyone they came across on Friday. Were highway rest stops open? (No.) Were courts open? (Yes.) Was the Minnesota Zoo open? (No.) Was the local swimming pool open? (Yes; only state functions were affected.)

Even as the state found itself with no approved budget, certain state services deemed essential never stopped. State police patrol and prison operations went on, as did payments to the state’s schools and payments for food stamps, welfare benefits and some programs for the disabled.

Other social services programs, though, including assistance for child care and some services for the blind, had received no such exemption as of Friday, officials said. Nor did the state’s lottery, racetracks, or about 100 road construction projects that were already under way around Minnesota. Torn-up patches, marked only by lonely orange cones, were common sights on Friday.

But even within state agencies, officials found themselves sorting through what must keep going and what ought not. Most prison guards stayed put, for instance, but the state Department of Corrections said it was ending family and volunteers’ visits and classes for prisoners and — if the shutdown lasts long enough for service to lapse — prisoners will see no more cable television.

For many here, though, the largest question was how Minnesota’s leaders might ever reach some accord.

For all the talk of compromise and suggestions by Republicans at one point on Thursday that a deal might be close, it appeared by Friday that the central philosophical divide — between holding the line on spending and raising taxes to maintain services for those most in need — had never really been crossed. Each group retreated to its own side.

“This is a night of deep sorrow for me because I don’t want to see this shutdown occur,” Mr. Dayton told reporters shortly before the midnight deadline on Thursday. “But I think there are basic principles and the well-being of millions of people in Minnesota that would be damaged not just for the next week or whatever long it takes, but the next two years and beyond with these kind of permanent cuts in personal care attendants and home health services and college tuition increases.”

That evening, hundreds of protesters demanding a solution to the impasse gathered outside the Capitol, and Republican lawmakers, describing themselves as discouraged and disheartened, held what some described as a “sit-in” in their chambers urging the governor to call a special session so some state services might be kept running temporarily.

“We’re talking about runaway spending that we can’t afford,” Kurt Zellers, the Republican House speaker, said. “And we will not saddle our children and grandchildren with mounds of debts with promises for funding levels that will not be there in the future.”

David Maki-Waller, 41 and a resident of Northfield, was also thinking of his children on Friday, but of a more immediate problem: how to keep the four of them (15, 11 and 8-year-old ) entertained over the long weekend now that the family’s reservation to camp at Frontenac State Park — secured months ago — had been canceled along with everyone else’s.

“They’ve been asking me for a Plan B,” Mr. Maki-Waller said. “What are we going to do this weekend? I don’t know. Everyone wanted to go camping.”
48 2011-07-02 MOSCOW — Russian regulators said on Friday that they had averted the collapse of one of the largest Russian banks by providing a bailout package of 395 billion rubles to Bank of Moscow, suggesting the bank’s problems with bad loans were more severe than previously acknowledged.

The bailout, worth $14.15 billion, raised the specter of balance sheet problems at other Russian banks, which had a tendency during the recession to roll over loans to struggling companies, rather than force them into bankruptcy courts.

Officials, though, have tried to characterize Bank of Moscow’s portfolio of bad loans for real estate projects in the capital as a unique problem created by the former mayor of Moscow as he tried to keep politically connected developers afloat during the downturn.

The bailout, announced in a statement on the Russian central bank’s Web site, will provide Bank of Moscow a 10-year loan of 295 billion rubles from a government deposit insurance program at an interest rate of 0.51 percent. The plan calls for a state bank, VTB, which recently bought equity in Bank of Moscow, to contribute an additional 100 billion rubles.

“The following measures aim to achieve stability of Bank of Moscow operations,” the statement said.

54 2011-07-03 Before Chase shaved $150,000 off her mortgage, Ms. Giosmas owed much more on her place than it was worth. It was a fate she shared with a quarter of all homeowners with mortgages across the nation. Being underwater, as it is called, can prevent these owners from moving and taking new jobs, and places the households at greater risk of foreclosure.

“It’s a huge problem,” said the economist Sam Khater. “Reducing negative equity would spark a housing recovery.”

While many homeowners desperately need help to keep their homes and cannot get it, the borrowers getting unsolicited relief from Chase sometimes suspect a trick. Cutting loan balances, even for loans in default, is supposedly so rare that Federal Reserve economists wrote in a paper in March that “we could find no evidence that any lender was actually reducing principal” on mortgages.

“I used to say every day, ‘Why doesn’t anyone get rewarded for doing the right thing and paying their bills on time?’ ” said Ms. Giosmas, who is an acupuncturist and real estate investor. “And I got rewarded.”

Option ARM loans like Ms. Giosmas’s gave borrowers the option of skipping the principal payment and some of the interest payment for an introductory period of several years. The unpaid balances would be added to the body of the loan.

Bank of America and Chase inherited their portfolios of option ARMs when they bought troubled lenders during the housing crash.

Chase, which declined to comment on its program, got $50 billion in option ARM loans when it bought in 2008. The lender, which said last fall that it had dealt with 22,000 option ARM loans with an unpaid principal balance of $8 billion, still has $33 billion of them in its portfolio.

Bank of America acquired a portfolio of 550,000 option ARMs from its purchase of in 2008. The lender said more than 200,000 had been converted to more stable mortgages.

Dan B. Frahm, a spokesman for Bank of America, said it was using every technique short of principal reduction to remake its loans, including waiving prepayment penalties, refinancing, lowering the interest rate, postponing some of the balance and extending the term.

“By proactively contacting pay option ARM customers and discussing other products with better options for long-term, affordable payments, we hope to prevent customers from reaching a point where they struggle to make their payments,” Mr. Frahm said.

Chase, Bank of America and the other big lenders are negotiating with the Obama administration and the nation’s attorneys general over foreclosures. Debt forgiveness and the moral hazard question of who deserves to be helped are among the most contentious issues.

The banks say cutting mortgage balances would be unfair to borrowers who remain current as well as impractical because so many loans are securitized into pools owned by investors. Bank of America’s chief executive, , told the attorneys general in April that cutting principal for current borrowers would send the wrong message to all those who have struggled to pay their bills. His counterpart at Chase, , bluntly said it was “off the table.”

Having an option ARM loan, however, apparently qualifies the borrower for special help. The loans, with their low initial payments and “teaser” interest rates, were immediately popular with buyers who could not afford or did not want to pay the soaring prices on houses. The problem was, eventually the rate would reset or the loan balance would have to be paid in full. “Nightmare Mortgages” they were called in a 2006 BusinessWeek cover piece.

Option ARMs were never quite as bad as predicted, partly because the crisis pushed down interest rates so far that the resets were relatively mild. Many owners did default on them, but others, like Ms. Giosmas, were quite happy to pay less for years than they would have under a conventional loan. She used option ARMs on her properties too.

“They saved me,” she said. “Why would I want to pay a lot more every month? I’d rather have it in my pocket.”

The concern the banks are showing for those who might get in trouble contrasts sharply with their efforts toward those already foreclosed. Bank of America and Chase were penalized last month by regulators for doing a poor job modifying mortgages in default.

Adam J. Levitin, a law professor, said these little-publicized programs were more evidence that the banks were behaving in contradictory and often maddening ways.

“ that should be happening aren’t, while loan modifications that shouldn’t be happening are,” he said. “Homeowners of any sort, whether current or in default, would rightly be confused and angry by this.”

The homeowners getting new loans, however, are quite pleased. In effect, the banks are paying the debt these owners accrued as the housing market plunged.

Ms. Giosmas bought her two-bedroom, two-bath apartment north of downtown Miami for $359,000 in early 2006, according to real estate records. She made a large down payment, but because each month she paid less than was necessary to pay off the loan, her debt swelled to about $300,000.

Meanwhile, the value of the apartment nosedived. By the time Ms. Giosmas got the letter from Chase, the condominium was worth less than half what she paid. “I would not have defaulted,” she said. “But they don’t know that.”

The letter, which Ms. Giosmas remembers as brief and “totally vague,” said Chase was cutting her principal by $150,000 while raising her interest rate to about 5 percent. Her payments would stay roughly the same.

A few months ago, Ms. Giosmas sold the place for $170,000, making a small profit. Having a loan that her lender considered toxic, she said, “turned out to be a blessing in disguise.”
55 2011-07-03 A handful of states have had such restoration laws on their books for some time, but with little notice, more than 20 states have passed similar measures since 2008. This surge can be traced to a law passed by Congress after the 2007 massacre at that was actually meant to make it harder for people with mental illness to get guns.

As a condition of its support for the measure, the National Rifle Association extracted a concession: the inclusion of a mechanism for restoring firearms rights to those who lost them for reasons.

The intent of these state laws is to enable people to regain the right to buy and possess firearms if it is determined that they are not a threat to public safety. But an examination of restoration procedures across the country, along with dozens of cases, shows that the process for making that determination is governed in many places by vague standards and few specific requirements.

States have mostly entrusted these decisions to judges, who are often ill-equipped to conduct investigations from the bench. Many seemed willing to simply give petitioners the benefit of the doubt. The results often seem haphazard.

At least a few hundred people with histories of mental health issues already get their gun rights back each year. The number promises to grow, since most of the new state laws are just beginning to take effect. And in November, the responded to the federal legislation by establishing a rights restoration process for more than 100,000 veterans who have lost their gun privileges after being designated mentally incompetent by the agency.

The issue goes to the heart of the nation’s complicated relationship with guns, testing the delicate balance between the need to safeguard the public and the dictates of what the Supreme Court has proclaimed to be a fundamental constitutional right.

Mike Fleenor, the commonwealth’s attorney here in Pulaski County, whose office opposed restoring Mr. French’s rights, worries that the balance is being thrown off by weak standards.

“I think that reasonable people can disagree about issues of the Second Amendment and gun control and things like that, but I don’t believe that any reasonable person believes that a mentally ill person needs a firearm,” Mr. Fleenor said. “The public has a right to be safe in their community.”

In case after case examined by , judges made decisions without important information about an applicant’s mental health.

Larry Lamb, a veteran from who has suffered from and , lost his gun rights and his cache of weapons in 2006 when he was involuntarily hospitalized after his dog’s death left him suicidal. A psychiatrist who examined Mr. Lamb wrote that he “is extremely paranoid with a full-blown P.T.S.D., believing that he is still at war in the active military and he is a personal bodyguard of the president and many senators.”

In early 2008, a Superior Court judge in San Diego granted Mr. Lamb’s petition to have his firearms rights restored, after his psychologist testified that he was not dangerous. But the judge, without access to Mr. Lamb’s full medical history, was unaware of a crucial fact: the local Veterans Affairs hospital had placed a “red flag” on Mr. Lamb, barring him from the hospital grounds because he was perceived to be a threat to personnel there.

The spread of these restoration laws is especially striking against the backdrop of the of Representative of and others in early this year by a suspect who has been declared mentally incompetent to stand trial — a case that spotlighted anew the link between mental illness and violence.

Supporters of gun rights and mental health advocates point out that a vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent. At the same time, though, a variety of studies have found that people with serious mental illness are more prone to violence than the general population.

The difficulty of assessing risk emerges in places like , where the Superior Court conducts a relatively thorough review of firearms rights requests. The Times found multiple instances over the last decade in which people who won back their gun rights went on to be charged with or convicted of violent or gun-related crimes, including spousal battery, negligent discharge of a firearm or assault with a firearm.

Then there are the nightmare cases — like that of Ryan Anthony, 35, a former Emmy Award-winning animator at who was involuntarily hospitalized in mid-2001 after losing his job and separating from his wife. Mr. Anthony filed a petition to get back his gun rights in early 2002, telling a court-appointed psychiatrist that he wanted to go skeet shooting.

A few weeks after the court granted his petition, Mr. Anthony bought a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun, holed up in a Holiday Inn in Burbank, Calif., and committed suicide.

The galvanizing revelation for gun-control advocates after the Virginia Tech massacre, the worst mass shooting in American history, was that the gunman, , should never have been able to buy the guns he used in the rampage.

Two years earlier, a special justice declared Mr. Cho “an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness” and ordered him to outpatient treatment.

Under federal law, anyone involuntarily committed or adjudicated a “mental defective” is barred from buying or possessing firearms. But the prohibition is often toothless because many states do not share their mental health records with the ’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Mr. Cho’s case offered Representative , Democrat of New York, a chance to advance a stalled bill that she had sponsored several years earlier to improve reporting by states to the F.B.I. database.

Ms. McCarthy’s political career and commitment to gun control was born out of tragedy. In 1993, a deranged gunman opened fire on a commuter train on , killing six people, including her husband, and gravely injuring her son. After more than a decade working on the issue in Congress, however, she had little to show for it.

Ms. McCarthy said she was wiser after years of setbacks. “I don’t believe in introducing legislation that won’t go anywhere,” she said.

She joined forces with Representative , a Democrat and former N.R.A. board member, who acted as a liaison with the gun lobby. The N.R.A. had long been interested in gun-rights restoration. It also wanted to help tens of thousands of veterans who lost their rights after being designated mentally incompetent and unable to handle their finances by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“We don’t want to treat our soldiers as potential criminals because they’re struggling with the aftermath of dealing with their service,” said Chris Cox, the association’s chief lobbyist.

The gun lobby secured a broad provision in the legislation. The new law made money available to states to help improve their record sharing, but the provision pushed by the N.R.A. made it a prerequisite for states to establish a “relief from disability” program for people with histories of mental health issues to apply for the restoration of gun rights. The Veterans Affairs Department and other federal agencies were required to do the same.

Gun-control groups attacked the provisions. “You make one bad judgment, and you could have another Virginia Tech on your hands,” Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, said in an interview.

But the most prominent gun-control organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, ultimately supported the bill. “She felt if she didn’t do this, it wasn’t going to proceed,” Paul Helmke, the group’s president, said of Ms. McCarthy. “An imperfect bill is better than no bill.”

Ms. McCarthy said her background as a nurse made her amenable to restoring someone’s rights, “if they could prove they are no longer mentally ill.”

After the bill became law in 2008, the N.R.A. began lobbying state lawmakers to keep requirements for petitioners to a minimum.

In , for example, a committee of law enforcement and mental health officials proposed requiring courts to make findings by “clear and convincing” evidence and mandating that petitioners have a recent mental health evaluation. But without the N.R.A.’s imprimatur, the legislation went nowhere.

Instead, a Republican state representative, Raúl R. Labrador, who is now a congressman, worked with the N.R.A. to draft a bill, passed last year, that dropped the requirement for a mental health evaluation and lowered the standard of proof to a “preponderance of evidence.”

A few states have set stricter standards. In New York, decisions are made by mental health officials, and applicants must submit a long list of documents, including five years’ worth of medical records and records of psychiatric and treatment going back 20 years. State officials can also require applicants to undergo clinical evaluations and risk assessments.

So far, there has been only a trickle of petitions in states with new restoration laws. The statutes are not yet well known, and federal authorities have yet to certify many of the state programs, making them fully operational under federal law.

But the demand will almost certainly grow, given the experience of states with longer-standing restoration statutes. In , for instance, judges restored gun rights to 180 people in 2010. At the federal level, the Veterans Affairs Department has already received more than 100 applications, of which 12 were processed and one was granted.

As for the original aim of Ms. McCarthy’s legislation, the reporting of mental health records by states to the F.B.I. database remains woeful. The reasons vary, including privacy laws, technological challenges and inattention from state officials.

But one significant hurdle has been that only a handful of states have received the federal money to improve their reporting capabilities. Officials with the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicated that while 22 states applied for grants in 2009 and 2010, only nine have gotten financing. Most of those that did not receive grants were rejected because they did not have certified restoration programs in place.

Lawmakers in , the scene of Mr. Cho’s rampage, were among the first to respond to the federal legislation by amending the state’s existing restoration statute to reflect the new law. To restore firearms rights, judges must find that the petitioner “will not likely act in a manner dangerous to public safety” and that “the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.” There are few specific standards or guidelines beyond that.

In 2010, judges in Virginia considered roughly 40 restoration applications and granted firearms rights under state law to 25 people — 14 who had been involuntarily committed, and 11 who had been the subjects of temporary detention orders and were voluntarily admitted for mental health treatment, according to figures from the Virginia Supreme Court and the State Police. In 2009, the courts restored rights to 21 people.

There is no central repository for cases heard around Virginia, but to get a picture of how the process works in one state, The Times obtained dozens of petitions and judges’ orders, mainly from 2009 and 2010, along with supporting documentation, and interviewed petitioners, lawyers and judges. The hearings were often relatively brief, sometimes perfunctory, and judges had wide latitude in handling the petitions.

Teresa Hall, who had moved to Idaho, said she simply wrote a letter to Hampton General District Court explaining that her commitment several years earlier occurred when she was experiencing marital difficulties. To her shock, she got a judge’s order granting her petition several days later in the mail.

“I was surprised it was that easy,” Ms. Hall said.

Some judges insisted on seeing a doctor’s note, but others did not.

In a typical case, Joshua St. Clair, who served in with the National Guard, got his gun rights back last year. About six months earlier, Mr. St. Clair, now 22, had heard a rattling at his gate. He said he “kind of blacked out” and the next thing he knew, he was pointing his M-4 assault rifle at his friend’s chest. That led to a temporary detention order, treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and loss of his firearms rights.

He took a note from his psychiatrist to his restoration hearing, which he said “lasted maybe about five minutes,” but he said the judge did not even ask to see it. The judge asked Mr. St. Clair’s father a few questions and asked Mr. St. Clair himself whether he thought he should have his rights restored. He said, “Of course.”

Often the doctors’ recommendations came from general practitioners, not mental health professionals. The notes tended to be short, often just a few sentences.

In many cases, the hospitalizations occurred just a few months, or even weeks, earlier.

Bobby Bullion, 37, got his gun rights back about four months after he left a note for his wife and son that indicated he was considering suicide — his wife had told him she was divorcing him — and the police found him in his car with two loaded weapons. Mr. Bullion presented the judge with a letter from his psychiatrist endorsing the restoration.

Oran Greenway, 68, had his rights restored in August, just two months after he was involuntarily committed. The judge’s restoration shocked Mr. Greenway’s relatives, who said they had been worried for years about his mental stability. In an interview, he said he started taking Lexapro for depression several years ago. In 2005, he slammed a large branch on a neighbor’s head during an argument, resulting in a conviction for assault and battery.

“Knowing what I know about Oran, I wouldn’t let Oran have a gun,” said Elizabeth Dequino, a cousin who lives up the road.

Even when a court-ordered commitment occurred years ago, the wisdom of restoring certain petitioners’ firearms rights was open to question. David Neal Moon, 63, was involuntarily committed in 1995 after his struggles with schizoaffective bipolar disorder got so bad that he had threatened to commit suicide and was walking in circles around his house with a MAK-90 assault rifle, as if on guard duty, according to medical and court records and an interview with Cynthia Allison, who is now his ex-wife.

A psychiatrist’s report described him threatening to “bash in the face of his wife” and ranting about getting his guns so he could “shoot everybody.” It also mentions a violent hair-pulling episode with his wife.

He had not been committed since, but he had continued to struggle with his illness and was bad about taking his medication, Ms. Allison said.

In an interview, Mr. Moon insisted he took his medication and was not mentally ill. Yet he alluded to his phone being tapped by the State Police and “by maybe the Pentagon.”

His firearms hearing in early 2009 in General District Court, where Mr. Moon showed up in military camouflage, lasted “about eight minutes,” said Mr. Moon’s lawyer, Gregory Smith, adding that he did not recall presenting any recent medical evaluation.

Just over a month later, another judge granted Ms. Allison a protective order against her husband. The pair had split up, and Mr. Moon had been making veiled threats by phone and telling his children about demons in the walls, according to her court affidavit.

“The judge just sat there and listened to him talk,” Ms. Allison said. “I didn’t even say anything. If you listened to him talk, you could tell he’s as crazy as a .”

Among those whose applications were denied, many were turned down for technical reasons, like filing in the wrong jurisdiction or failing to show up for a hearing.

In others cases — like one last year in Lynchburg in which the petitioner, Undreas Smith, submitted a letter explaining he had been struggling with recent deaths in his family — the judge ruled against the petitioner because he failed to provide documentation from a mental health provider.

In the case of James Tuckson Jr. of Harrisonburg, who was involuntarily committed in 2006 and applied in October to get back his gun rights, prosecutors said his multiple arrests probably played a significant role in the judge’s decision to deny Mr. Tuckson’s petition.

Presented with The Times’s findings, Richard Bonnie, the chairman of the Virginia Commission on Mental Health Law Reform, which was formed after the Virginia Tech shootings, expressed concerns about the restoration process, particularly the vagueness of the statute. Mr. Bonnie said the panel would begin collecting information on the petitions on a monthly basis to better evaluate how they were being handled.

“There is an ambiguity in the statute that we need to look at,” he said.

When Sam French, the man with bipolar disorder whose daughter removed his guns, appeared late last year in Pulaski General District Court, he presented his recent medical records. Progress notes over several months showed that his bipolar disorder and substance abuse were in “remission.”

Nevertheless, Bobby Lilly, an assistant commonwealth’s attorney, opposed the petition, partly because Mr. French’s latest update indicated he had expressed interest in lowering the dosage of his medication. Mr. French’s two most recent hospitalizations had come after he went off his medication.

Mr. Lilly was also worried because it had been less than a year since his release. “We didn’t have a demonstrated track record of being able to comply with whatever the mental health provider’s directives were,” Mr. Lilly said.

In fact, a few months later, in March, a judge at the circuit level — the higher court in Virginia — denied Mr. French’s application for a concealed weapons permit because a five-year wait after a psychiatric commitment is required for such a permit.

But there is no waiting period for the restoration of basic gun rights.

Mr. French’s case fell to Judge Royce Glenwood Lookabill, a genial presence on the bench since 2006. Judge Lookabill said he quizzed Mr. French about whether he had had any other episodes and whether he was taking his prescribed drugs.

“I was satisfied that he wasn’t a danger — again, subject to him taking his medication,” Judge Lookabill said in an interview.

The judge acknowledged, however, that he might have made a different decision had he been aware of Mr. French’s previous commitments, including one that came after he was arrested for public drunkenness and later allegedly assaulted two police officers. (The assault charges were dropped.) No one had checked a state database for his commitment history.

“It’s a hole in the process,” said Mr. Lilly, who added that his office had only limited access to such information.

Judge Lookabill suggested that the process belonged in a higher court and should be made more adversarial. “I would feel a lot more comfortable,” he said, “if there were more safeguards.”

Most people with mental health issues, of course, will never be violent. But there is widespread consensus among scientists that the increased risk of violence among those with a serious mental illness — , or bipolar disorder — is statistically significant. That risk rises when substance abuse, which is more prevalent among people with mental illness, is also present.

One frequently cited study, led by Jeffrey W. Swanson, an expert on mental health and violence who is now at , showed that 33 percent of people with a serious mental illness reported past violent behavior, compared with 15 percent of people without a major mental disorder. Violent behavior was defined as including acts ranging from taking part in more than one fistfight as an adult to using a weapon in a fight. The rate for those with substance abuse issues but without a serious mental illness was 55 percent. The highest rate, 64 percent, was exhibited by people with major mental disorders and substance abuse issues.

Other studies have concluded that additional factors significantly increase the risk of violence among people with mental illness, including exposure to violence and being a victim of violence.

But taking these data and applying them to individuals is profoundly difficult.

Scientists have concluded that it is most accurate to augment clinical judgments with an “actuarial” approach, in which variables like psychiatric diagnosis, history of violence and anger control are plugged into a risk assessment model. The models categorize people into higher and lower risk groups. But many clinicians are unfamiliar with the technique. Indeed, none of the doctors who wrote letters on behalf of their patients in cases The Times reviewed appeared to utilize the approach.

Doctors’ declarations clearly influenced judges. But most wrote their letters at the request of their patients, which Randy Otto, a former president of the American Board of Forensic Psychology and an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said can be problematic.

“They’re more subject to pressure from their patients to offer opinions that will help the patients get what they want,” Dr. Otto said.

He said many doctors, particularly those not in the mental health field, are probably not steeped in the most important clues to future violence. Even and , relying on their clinical judgment alone, are extremely unreliable in predicting violence, studies have shown.

“Unstructured clinical judgments, just judgments of mental health professionals about how risky someone is,” Dr. Otto said, “are probably the least reliable and the least accurate.”

The difficulties of predicting violence are particularly striking in Los Angeles County, where the Superior Court has a relatively rigorous process for determining whether to restore gun rights.

In California, anyone placed on a 72-hour or 14-day psychiatric hold and determined to be a danger to themselves or others loses gun rights for five years. But upon discharge, the person can apply to have these prohibitions lifted. Applicants in Los Angeles County are required to provide records from all involuntary hospitalizations, which are checked against a list provided by the State Department of Justice. They must also be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist, who can call friends or relatives to gather more information.

Under the statute, the burden is on the district attorney to establish that the petitioner “would not be likely to use firearms in a safe and lawful manner.”

Over all, 1,579 petitions have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court since 2000. More than 1,000 were dismissed, usually because applicants did not furnish the required documentation or failed to show up. Of those who actually got hearings, 381 won their cases.

“Dealing with somebody who suffers from severe mental illness and mixing that with firearms, you really have to cross the t’s and dot the i’s,” said Richard J. Vagnozzi, a deputy district attorney who handles these cases. Mr. Vagnozzi said the process “isn’t perfect, but we do the best we can with the available data and what we’re allowed to do.”

Even with the vigorous checks, there are people like Afshin Poordavoud, who lost his gun rights in June 2000. During a heated argument with his brother, Mr. Poordavoud threatened to shoot himself. His brother called the police, and Mr. Poordavoud was hospitalized briefly, according to court records.

Several months later, Mr. Poordavoud petitioned to have his firearms rights restored and to have the police return his shotgun and 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. A court-appointed psychiatrist recommended that the decision be put off for three months and that Mr. Poordavoud get a full psychiatric evaluation and treatment, pointing out that the hospital had found him to be “likely depressed and minimizing his level of depression and suicidal risk.”

Mr. Poordavoud returned to court three months later with a letter from a therapist, indicating he had been undergoing treatment. This time, a different psychiatrist examined him but wrote at the end of his report, “Inconclusive: I have no opinion.” The psychiatrist suggested that the case be referred back to the initial doctor so she could interview Mr. Poordavoud’s therapist and obtain the full file from his hospitalization.

The judge, however, granted Mr. Poordavoud’s restoration request that same day in a pro forma hearing.

In late 2004, Mr. Poordavoud drove up to a house in Chatsworth, Calif., in the middle of the night and began banging on the windows and the doors, shouting for an acquaintance to come out, according to court testimony.

When a man opened the door, Mr. Poordavoud sprayed him and two others with mace, according to court testimony. In the ensuing fight, Mr. Poordavoud slashed at one of them with a pair of brass knuckles fitted with blades.

Mr. Poordavoud retrieved a gun from his car and fired a single shot that missed. In an interview, he said he had only fired in the air in self-defense.

The police eventually charged Mr. Poordavoud with multiple felonies. He pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and using tear gas not in self-defense, and he was sentenced to about a year in county jail.

“I had an anger problem,” said Mr. Poordavoud, who is no longer allowed to have guns because of his felony record. “I still have an anger problem.”

Violence against others is not the only concern.

Ryan Anthony, the talented but troubled Disney artist who had a history of , had talked about suicide for years with relatives. His father, Michael Anthony, said his son once threatened to jump off a highway overpass; another time, he vowed to hang himself from a chandelier in his home. A few months before he filed his petition to restore his firearms rights, he had attempted suicide by swallowing some pills, said his brother Loren.

But Mr. Anthony was able to hide his troubled past when a court-appointed psychiatrist examined him for the restoration hearing in April 2002. He told Dr. Rose Pitt, according to court records, that he had simply been going through a difficult period after he lost his job and split up with his wife. He was normally not a drinker, he said, but began drinking heavily. Since his involuntary hospitalization in mid-2001, he had been sober and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Dr. Pitt wrote in her report.

“Does not own guns but wants to skeet shoot, and so wants to purchase guns,” Dr. Pitt wrote. “There does not appear to be any contraindication to his being able to get guns.”

His relatives were incredulous. Had they been called, they said, they would have told officials to deny his request.

“I would have said, ‘No, that doesn’t sound right,’ ” Loren Anthony said. “He didn’t like guns.”

Mr. Anthony had been staying with Steven and Sofia Shafit, family friends. They said he had been doing better but was still hurting.

About two weeks after he got his firearms rights restored, he borrowed $300 from Ms. Shafit, saying he wanted to take a girl on a date. Instead, he went out and bought a shotgun — investigators found the receipt by his body — and checked into a room at a Holiday Inn.

On the desk, he left a three-page suicide note, according to a report from the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. At some point, he lay down on the bed, placed the barrel of the shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
56 2011-07-03 Wladimir Klitschko won a lopsided unanimous decision over David Haye on Saturday in Hamburg, Germany, adding the World Boxing Association title to his heavyweight haul. Klitschko dominated almost from the opening bell against a smaller fighter who took few chances.
57 2011-07-03 Amalia Lopez transferred to Tamayo Elementary charter school last year from a neighborhood school, where she says no one talked to her about high school options. It was assumed, said Amalia, 14, that she would attend her neighborhood high school.

Fortunately for her, Tamayo had a “graduate support” program that informed her of application and testing deadlines, required her to apply to at least four high schools and provided other guidance.

Now Amalia plans to attend Whitney Young High School. She will be the first in her family to attend high school in the United States and expects to be the first to graduate. Whitney Young graduates 93 percent of its Hispanic students.

The program at Tamayo Elementary is run by the United Neighborhood Organization, which guides students toward 112 schools, including charter, selective-enrollment and parochial schools that the organization judges to be among the city’s most desirable. No neighborhood schools are on the UNO list.

Before the program began, five years ago, 78 percent of the students at its two charter elementary schools attended neighborhood high schools in the Pilsen and Brighton Park areas, according to UNO. This year, 95 percent of the nearly 400 graduates from UNO’s seven elementary schools will attend high schools the organization has endorsed. With the organization’s help, students have netted more than $300,000 in financial aid from the schools they will attend, UNO officials said.
58 2011-07-03 Want to really stretch out the speculation? What if both run, and both win? Senators would elect a lieutenant governor, who would be acting governor, and would have to elect another lieutenant governor to preside over the Senate.

Are they thinking about it? Sure. They’re politicians, and they’re ambitious, and they see great historical figures in their mirrors when they put on makeup or shave every morning.

Succession was part of the undercurrent in the last days of the special session that ended last week. The sanctuary cities bill urged by the governor stalled in the House, and lawmakers made a late effort to tack it onto a must-pass school finance and budget bill. Republican senators blocked it, saying the bill was controversial and risky enough without the added weight of sanctuary cities. In the aftermath (and partly to save face for House leaders who couldn’t advance the original bill), Mr. Perry singled out Senator Robert L. Duncan, Republican of Lubbock, as the assassin.

“Because of this action, the special session will not provide our peace officers with the discretion they need to adequately keep Texans safe from those that would do them harm,” Mr. Perry said in a press release, after pointing the finger at Mr. Duncan. Others, including Mr. Dewhurst, jumped to Mr. Duncan’s defense. That was the public play.

To some in the Senate, it was a signal from Mr. Perry to fellow conservatives that Mr. Duncan isn’t his choice if the Senate has to pick a successor for Mr. Dewhurst.

Outside groups were deeply involved in the race for speaker of the Texas House at the beginning of the legislative session, and there’s no reason to believe they’d stay out of a race for lieutenant governor. The governor’s swipe at Mr. Duncan, in that interpretation, was a signal for those groups.

Another reading was that Mr. Duncan killed the bill to build support among Democrats in the event that he does run for the job.

Whatever really happened, the conspiracy theories are evidence that the political class is thinking about what’s next, and who’s next, in the lineup of Texas politics.

State senators, often at odds with the lieutenant governor and, in some cases, given to sniping at him behind his back, gave Mr. Dewhurst a valedictory ovation at the end of the special legislative session. They know he might not be back in the chair again, and wanted to give him a warm salute.

They were covering their bets. Politics is a risky enterprise, after all, and the safest prediction is that the state’s top officeholders in January 2013 will be the two people the voters chose, and not former state senators elevated by 16 of their colleagues.
59 2011-07-03 Last month, with almost no fanfare, the federal government did a very decent thing: It canceled the deportation of a Venezuelan man after he married an American man in and claimed legal residency as a spouse. But the government did not say that it was formally recognizing their marriage, because it cannot. The Defense of Marriage Act, which ranks with the most overtly discriminatory laws in the nation’s history, remains on the books, prohibiting federal recognition of legal .

The deportation dismissal was an isolated act of kindness by the agency. It is heavily outweighed by the continuing inequality imposed on thousands of same-sex couples who have been legally married in the five states — plus the — where it is already allowed. Likewise, the many couples who will take advantage of New York’s new marriage equality law will not be married in the eyes of Washington.

That means they cannot receive benefits for spouses, as can the straight couple next door. They cannot file joint federal income returns or take advantage of the larger exemption for married couples. Federal laws like those giving the right of family leave do not apply to them. If they work for the federal government, they cannot extend their policy to their spouses. A childless soldier with a same-sex spouse will not receive the housing allowance for dependents, even after “ ” is fully repealed.

And, because the law allows states to ignore a same-sex marriage performed elsewhere, spouses may not be able to visit each other in a hospital if they are traveling.

The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President in one of his worst policy moments. Any Congress with a real respect for personal freedom would repeal it. That, of course, does not describe the current Congress, where many members talk a great deal about freedom but apply it mainly to businesses and gun owners. With legislative repeal not on the horizon, the best hope for ending this legalized bigotry is with the courts.

Last year, a federal judge in Massachusetts said the law’s definition of marriage as only between a man and a woman violated the equal-protection provisions of the Constitution. In June, a federal bankruptcy court in California said the law was unconstitutional. Other cases have been filed in New York and Connecticut, and the Justice Department, having agreed that the marriage definition is unconstitutional, has refused to defend it in those court cases. (The House hired its own lawyer to defend the law.)
60 2011-07-03 It has been six months since Congress voted to allow military service by openly gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans, but the law banning their service is still in effect. The Pentagon has not certified that the military is ready for the change, and while that process needlessly drags on, soldiers continue to be discharged for acknowledging their sexuality. The full repeal of this discriminatory policy should be one of the highest priorities for the new defense secretary, Leon Panetta.

The armed forces are a conservative, tradition-bound institution, and proponents of repeal have long known it would not happen overnight. Scores of regulations had to be rewritten, training sessions had to be held for changed procedures, and old prejudices had to be overcome. The Pentagon has tried to anticipate questions about a huge set of possible circumstances.

In one set of training scenarios used by the Marines, for example, the guidelines explain that a military recruiter with strong religious feelings against homosexuality will no longer be able to refuse to process a gay applicant, but — because of freedom of religious expression — a military chaplain will be allowed to preach in a base chapel that homosexuality is a sin.

Nonetheless, service members also have long known that this day is coming, and six months seems long enough for them to get the message that the law has changed. Even after the Pentagon and President Obama officially sign the certification of readiness, the law provides for another 60-day period before it takes effect.

Beyond changing the regulations, the most pressing issue is whether commanders will put a firm stop to the harassment of openly gay or lesbian soldiers that often takes place in locker rooms or barracks. The rules are clear that commanders are expected to crack down. But there have been regular reports that training sessions are not always taken seriously, particularly by Marines.

The services will come to accept the new policy, just as they have absorbed many social changes over the decades, including racial and sexual integration. But there are clearly some people who will continue to resist the new orders, and they and their commanders will have to decide whether they should remain in the military.

Prejudice and harassment apparently led at least one airman to announce that he was gay and request a discharge from the military under “don’t ask, don’t tell,” according to The Advocate, a gay publication. The discharge was approved in late April. Three others in the Air Force have also requested and received similar discharges in recent weeks.
61 2011-07-03 Sunday Business asked Equilar, the executive compensation data company, to compile and analyze pay data from corporate filings. To be included in the revised study, a company must have been incorporated in the United States and must have filed a definitive proxy statement by June 23. The 200 highest-paid C.E.O.’s at companies with revenue of $10.78 billion or more were included.

A survey published in April looked at preliminary data on executive pay. At the time, several large companies, like Time Warner and JPMorgan Chase, had not filed their executive pay data as of April 1, so they were not included in the list. At the time, the cutoff was companies with annual revenue of at least $7 billion.

Some companies did not make the revenue cutoff for this survey, but their C.E.O.’s earned above the median. For instance, Howard Schultz of Starbucks made $21.7 million last year while John F. Lundgren of Stanley Black & Decker made $32.6 million, but their companies had less than $10.78 billion in revenue.

For each executive, Equilar calculated the total compensation as the sum of base salary, discretionary and performance-based cash bonuses, the grant-date value of stock and option awards, and other compensation. Other compensation typically includes benefits and perquisites. All figures are taken from the Summary Compensation Table provided in each company’s proxy statement.

Whenever grant-date values are not provided for option awards, Equilar calculated the value of stock option grants using the widely accepted Black-Scholes method and the company’s own option valuation assumptions.

64 2011-07-03 And currency markets haven’t panicked at all. More than a year ago, when Greece’s fiscal troubles first hit the headlines, the euro plummeted nearly 20 percent against the dollar. This time around, though, the euro has dropped only around 2 percent.

These messages may seem confusing. But upon further examination, all of these markets are probably pointing to the same thing, said Michael J. Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfolio, a mutual fund that invests in stocks, bonds, currencies and alternative assets.

Mr. Cuggino summarizes the global outlook this way: “It’s unmistakable that the economy is slowing, but it won’t be a material slowdown, and growth will probably resume in the second half of the year.”

Consider the bond market. While it’s true that Treasury yields nearly sank to November 2008 levels, the reason may not be all that ominous. “In terms of depth and breadth, there are really just two big buckets of government bonds in the world — Treasuries and European bonds,” said Carl P. Kaufman, co-manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. To some extent, what we have seen is “a flight to safety from one bucket to the other,” he said.

Mr. Kaufman noted that until last week, the flow of money from European bonds to Treasuries had been especially pronounced among shorter-term securities. As much as yields on 10-year Treasuries fell, he noted that rates on two-year notes fell faster, dropping as low as 0.35 percent, from 0.85 percent in April. That’s mainly because investors fleeing the European market were “simply looking for a short-term place to park their cash,” he said.

But those yields reversed course last week; the two-year yield is now at 0.49 percent, and the so-called yield curve — a term that describes the spectrum or interest rates paid out by bonds of varying maturities — had steepened slightly. “Historically, steep yield curves signal recoveries,” Mr. Kaufman said.

George Strickland, a portfolio manager and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M., agrees. “I’d be much more concerned if the yield curve had flattened — that would be a very bearish signal for all risk markets.”

He said that while Treasury yields did fall to near financial-crisis levels, the credit markets haven’t been experiencing the liquidity problems of a few years ago. For instance, he said, companies are not having problems rolling over commercial paper, a form of short-term debt that companies use to fund their basic obligations.

How should we interpret the relative stability in the currency market?

David C. Wright , managing director of Sierra Investment Management in Santa Monica, Calif., said that “it’s been somewhat surprising that we haven’t seen more stress on the euro.” But we’re still in the early stages of the crisis, he said. And market strategists say that other factors are probably also at work.

Harry W. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management in Los Angeles, recalled that when the euro plunged a year ago, there were concerns about whether a common currency could be sustained. Such fears put even more pressure on the euro. But this time around, the currency’s relative stability probably reflects confidence “that the euro will be sustained by policy makers and politicians,” he said.

Mr. Hartford added that the more muted reaction in currency markets might reflect the view that because Greece accounts for only around 2.5 percent of the euro zone’s gross domestic product, its troubles can be contained. “In the grand scheme of things, assuming this crisis doesn’t spread, it’s not a massive issue,” he said.

Of course, if it does spread — to Ireland and Portugal and beyond — all bets on the euro are off. And the debate about the health of the recovery will start anew.
65 2011-07-03 Dr. Emily Nurit Steinberg and Zachary Robert Fadem are to be married Sunday evening by Cantor Perry Fine at Capitale, an event space in New York.

The bride, 31, completed her residency in psychiatry last month at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Later this month, she is to begin working at Mount Sinai as an assistant professor in the psychiatry department. She graduated from Cornell and received a medical degree from George Washington University.

She is the daughter of Wilma Steinberg and Martin E. Steinberg of South Orange, N.J. The bride’s mother teaches high school English at the Golda Och Academy in West Orange, N.J. Her father was until March the executive news editor of AOL News in New York. He is now a part-time editor on the foreign and national copy desks of The New York Times.

The bridegroom, 32, is a securities research analyst at an investment banking unit of Barclays, the British bank. He works in New York, making recommendations for the stocks of business-service companies and for-profit educational institutions. The bridegroom is also a certified public accountant. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

He is a son of Jennifer J. Fadem and Bruce A. Fadem of Tulsa, Okla. The bridegroom’s father is the founder and managing partner of Great Southwestern Exploration, an oil and gas exploration and production company based in Tulsa.
66 2011-07-03 Charlene Lynette Wittstock and Prince Albert II of Monaco were married Friday in a civil ceremony led by Philippe Narmino, president of the Council of State of Monaco.

The ceremony, held in the throne room of the palace in Monte Carlo, was the first for a ruling prince since 1956, when the bridegroom’s father, Prince Rainier III, married Grace Kelly.

On Saturday, Bernard Barsi, archbishop of Monaco, performed a Roman Catholic ceremony in the main courtyard of the Prince’s Palace.

Princess Charlene, 33, wore a dress by Chanel for the ceremony on Friday. She was a swimming champion in South Africa and competed for its national team in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

She and Prince Albert met that year at an international swimming meet in Monaco over which the prince presided. She still competes occasionally, most recently in February in South Africa’s annual Midmar Mile, as a fund-raiser for her Special Olympics Charity Foundation.

The bride is the daughter of Lynette Wittstock and Mike Wittstock of Benoni, South Africa. Her father is a salesman and her mother is a former swimming coach and competitive diver.
67 2011-07-03 Emily Susan Schlesinger, a daughter of Phyllis Fineman Schlesinger and Leonard A. Schlesinger of Wellesley, Mass., was married Saturday to Hui Gong Li, the son of Zhi Ting Li of Garden Prairie, Ill., and the late Bi Shan Zhao. Rabbi David B. Kudan officiated at the Moultonborough, N.H., summer home of the bride’s family; taking part was Judge Algenon L. Marbley of the Federal District Court in Columbus, Ohio, for whom the bride was a law clerk.

Ms. Schlesinger, 31, is keeping her name. She is an associate in the Seattle office of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, a Palo Alto, Calif., law firm. She graduated from Brown and received a law degree from Vanderbilt. The bride’s father is the president of Babson College. Her mother is an adjunct lecturer of management at Babson.

Dr. Li, 33, is a pharmacist for a Walgreen’s store in Seattle. He graduated from Illinois State University and received a doctoral degree in pharmacy from the University of Illinois in Chicago. The bridegroom’s father retired as the owner of Lung Fung Restaurant in Belvidere, Ill.
68 2011-07-03 “I went to Dawson, trusting him, and this started the ball rolling,” Mr. Geist told me. “He left us with nothing. My daughter decided to move in with us and help us out because we couldn’t handle it.”

According to court documents, Mr. Dawson turned to a friend, Michael Laucella, at a mortgage broker called the Custom Capital Corporation, to secure the new mortgages for his clients. Mr. Laucella had served time in prison for state and federal securities and financial crimes before joining Custom Capital as a custodial employee, according to court filings.

In a deposition in the case, Mr. Laucella testified that he became a loan officer at Custom Capital even though, he said, the terms of his federal probation barred him from “opening any ‘new lines of credit.’ ” Mr. Laucella also said he remained at Custom Capital after the company received a letter in September 2005 from the New York State Banking Department directing the company to terminate him “immediately.”

A lawyer for Mr. Laucella and Custom Capital declined to comment.

Mr. Dawson also worked with Alfred Arena, a branch manager of the First National Bank of Long Island, according to court filings and interviews with Mr. Dawson’s former customers. It was at First National that Mr. Dawson kept accounts in which he deposited checks that his clients endorsed over to him. Mr. Dawson testified that Mr. Arena attended more than 50 client meetings at Mr. Dawson’s offices over the years. The Long Island bank also made home equity loans to victims of Mr. Dawson’s scheme. A lawyer for the bank and Mr. Arena did not return a phone call seeking comment.

Neither Mr. Laucella nor Mr. Arena has been accused of wrongdoing.

Contending that all the loans made to these clients were obviously improper and full of red flags, Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer who represents the families fleeced by Mr. Dawson, has sued various lenders involved with Mr. Dawson.

“At every turn, the banks placed their own interests ahead of the interests of their customers,” Mr. Zamansky said. “The banks were driven by their insatiable thirst for revenues and were recklessly indifferent to the devastating consequences these loans would have on the borrowers.”

Bank of America’s Countrywide Home Loans, as well as PHH Mortgage, Homecomings Financial and the other lenders, have argued that they should be dismissed from the case because Mr. Dawson caused the victims’ losses, not them.

But in a ruling issued a few weeks ago, Justice F. Dana Winslow of New York State Supreme Court in Nassau County said the banks’ actions should be examined.

A spokeswoman for Bank of America and a spokesman for Homecomings Financial both said that the case involves a theft by a financial adviser with no connection to them. Both said their institutions would vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

Yet Justice Winslow seems to have rejected the argument that the banks were wholly blameless.

“Significantly, the courts have held that banks do owe duties of care to their own customers,” he wrote, in deciding to keep the banks as defendants in the case. “Moreover, there is a public interest in ensuring the alleged duties relied upon are ‘performed with reasonable care’ — as evidenced by the recent flurry of consumer-oriented laws and amendments enacted in the wake of the ‘subprime mortgage meltdown.’ ”

UNTIL all the facts of the case are heard at trial, it is unclear whether the banks will be held liable for injury to Mr. Dawson’s victims.

But Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at the law firm of Tolins & Lowenfels who is not involved in the case, said Justice Winslow’s ruling was significant. It appeared to counter the more restrictive approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in recent years on the issue of holding third parties liable, he said.

“This decision by a lower New York State court may open the door to actions against mortgage brokers, banks and related parties involved in the recent mortgage debacle,” Mr. Lowenfels said. “It will be interesting to see how the facts and the law unfold in this case, particularly in the face of recent U.S. Supreme Court cases embracing a more limited approach to liabilities in analogous areas.”

New York judges have been ahead of the curve before on financial wrongdoing. They were among the first to recognize the flaws in banks’ foreclosure practices, shifting away from a stance held over decades of automatically ruling in favor of lenders and against troubled borrowers. Perhaps the ruling by Justice Winslow is evidence of another such turn in the tide.
69 2011-07-03 But while the I.M.F. is busy with scandal and the debt crisis now shaking Europe, officials at the World Bank’s headquarters here are confronting some existential questions, including the big one: What exactly are we doing here?

The World Bank’s traditional role has been to finance specific projects that foster economic development, whereas the I.M.F.’s goal is to safeguard the global monetary system. But many people, particularly in the developing world, have long questioned whether the economic prescriptions that these two lofty institutions hand down from Washington — essentially: liberalize, privatize and deregulate — have done anything but advance the interests of wealthy nations like the United States. That the I.M.F. is now championing deeply unpopular austerity measures for Greece, where street protests continued last week, only sharpens that point.

So it might come as a surprise that the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, a career diplomat and member of the Republican foreign-policy elite, argues that the most valuable currency of the World Bank isn’t its money — it is its information.

Created in 1944 and, by custom, headed by an American, the World Bank initially helped finance the reconstruction of war-torn Europe. Since then, it has extended many trillions in loans for a wide variety of projects, be they institutions like schools and hospitals, infrastructure like roads or, controversially, environmentally unfriendly projects like coal-fired power plants and hydroelectric dams. Along the way the World Bank, like the I.M.F., has tinkered with entire economies, sometimes with disastrous results.

Yet the Haiti flights — which cost about the same as a World Bank report — were the harbinger of a quiet revolution now gripping this aloof institution.

More than 600 engineers in 21 countries analyzed the data collected over Haiti, and their conclusions — essentially what to rebuild and where — have since been used by the Haitian government, relief organizations, companies and myriad others.

“It was like the cowboy West in terms of the boundaries of the project and what we were able to do,” says Stuart P. D. Gill, a computational cosmologist and project coordinator for the bank’s disaster reduction and recovery labs.

Long regarded as a windowless ivory tower, the World Bank is opening its vast vault of information. True, the bank still lends roughly $57 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. But it is increasingly competing for influence and power with Wall Street, national governments and smaller regional development banks, who have as much or more money to offer. It is no longer the only game in town.

And so Mr. Zoellick, 57, is wielding knowledge — lots of it. For more than a year, the bank has been releasing its prized data sets, currently giving public access to more than 7,000 that were previously available only to some 140,000 subscribers — mostly governments and researchers, who pay to gain access to it.

Those data sets contain all sorts of information about the developing world, whether workaday economic statistics — gross domestic product, consumer price inflation and the like — or arcana like how many women are breast-feeding their children in rural Peru.

It is a trove unlike anything else in the world, and, it turns out, highly valuable. For whatever its accuracy or biases, this data essentially defines the economic reality of billions of people and is used in making policies and decisions that have an enormous impact on their lives.

Mr. Zoellick says the bank’s newfound openness is part of a push to embrace competition, both internally and externally, as it tries to reduce poverty and foster economic development.

In short, the World Bank, long synonymous with Washington elitism, is taking steps to “democratize development economics,” to borrow a phrase from Mr. Zoellick, who is leading what many insiders regard as an assault on the bank’s power and prestige.

“We do not have a monopoly on the answers,” he said in a speech at Georgetown University last fall. “For too long, prescriptions have flowed one way.”

ROBERT ZOELLICK folds his long, lean frame onto a couch in his 12th-floor office in the World Bank headquarters.

When a visitor asks where she should sit, Mr. Zoellick pats his leg and says, “Anywhere but here.” Then he smiles, pats the cushion beside him, and adds, “Or here.” He then points next door to the I.M.F. headquarters.

It is a joke — not particularly P.C. — in reference to Mr. Strauss-Kahn and the legal maelstrom up in New York.

Joking aside, Mr. Zoellick speaks with an ambassadorial gravitas — not surprising, given that he spent most of his career as a United States diplomat.

Mr. Zoellick came to the job in July 2007, replacing Paul D. Wolfowitz, who resigned after a long string of controversies then ended in a scandal about his relationship with an employee.

A lawyer by training, Mr. Zoellick has made the rounds in Washington, particularly in Republican circles. In the 1980s, at the Treasury Department and the White House, he advised President George H. W. Bush. In the 1990s, he worked at the mortgage giant Fannie Mae, today a potent symbol of all that went wrong in the mortgage business.

Later, as the United States trade representative for President George W. Bush, he was a vocal advocate of free trade. Later still, at the State Department, under Condoleezza Rice, he advocated the war with Iraq and was viewed as an architect of the administration’s China policy. He then cooled his heels briefly as a managing director at Goldman Sachs.

Now, he is essentially telling the World Bank’s 10,000 employees that he no longer considers their institution to be at the center of the development universe.

“As opposed to some imperious bureaucracy in Washington, we’re making things open and accessible to people,” he says. “That makes for better performance, it makes for a more open system, it makes for people having a different attitude about the World Bank.”

To some World Bank insiders, this amounts to a declaration of war on their decades-old culture, a war that began when Mr. Zoellick arrived and instituted a daily 8:30 a.m. meeting of senior executives — “a shock to some of the people involved,” he recalls.

“It’s not been bloody, but it’s not been easy, either,” says Sanjay Pradhan, vice president of the World Bank Institute, a unit that advises and counsels governments, and that Mr. Zoellick has designated as his strike force in the fight for greater transparency.

He is not the first World Bank leader to struggle to match its practices to its principles. The bank, after all, has had an open-information policy for four decades. James D. Wolfensohn, who ran the bank from 1995 to 2005 and was beloved by employees, even called it the “Knowledge Bank,” and during his tenure, it spent $280 million to improve the way it shares information with its staff, client governments and organizations.

But by its own account, the World Bank failed to embed that concept of openness in its own culture, despite significant improvements in technology and tools for sharing information.

“Senior management can announce grand strategies and reorganizations, but it must rely on middle management at the bank to execute them,” says David Ian Shaman, a former World Bank official. “Middle management is composed of fiefdoms that are preserved by maintaining the status quo and so has little incentive to implement change.”

In a book titled “The World Bank Unveiled: Inside the Revolutionary Struggle for Transparency,” Mr. Shaman chronicled his battle during the Wolfensohn era to webcast things like internal policy debates. Bank insiders worried that his Web service, called B-SPAN, would open the bank to criticism and reduce its authority.

“The cultural norm of the bank is to hoard information, and when it does release information, it is either perfect or choreographed for delivery to a specific audience,” Mr. Shaman says.

In 2004, for instance, B-SPAN was initially barred from taping a speech given by a development economist, Hernando de Soto, at an event to inaugurate a new policy on information access.

“I was told it would be too controversial,” Mr. Shaman recalls. The video ultimately was made but, like B-SPAN itself, it was quietly mothballed when he left the bank a year later.

DAVID ROODMAN, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, has had his own struggles with the World Bank. But as a researcher, he says he understands reluctance among World Bank officials to throw open the doors. The bank’s researchers work hard to collect data. If it appears online, they may lose a chance to mine it for their own research papers, and thus lose money and prestige.

“It’s the capital basis of your world — and if you share what you’ve done and people find mistakes, what’s in it for you?” Mr. Roodman says.

People outside the World Bank are eager for its information. Its newly released data — from economic stats to numbers on landmines — has attracted more than 4.5 million unique views. Indeed, more people come to its Web site looking for data than anything else.

“I’m astonished by the number of people apparently just waiting for our data to become free,” says Shaida Badiee, director of the bank’s economic development data group. “I had no idea how big a deal this was going to be.”

Mr. Zoellick says that he understands his employees’ worries but that opening analysis and research to public scrutiny will lead to fewer mistakes. “There will be, I’m sure over a series of years, bad stories that come out as a result of this, and if you’re part of the bad stories, it’s probably not going to be something you’re going to like,” he says. “But my view is that it is far better for the institution and its health to be open.”

One day last spring, in the bank’s sunlit atrium, Mr. Zoellick’s team doled out prizes for a contest called Apps for Development. Software developers worldwide had submitted Web applications based on the bank’s data.

The atrium is the bank’s agora, home to shows and presentations, and people often arrive in national dress for big events.

But that day, the most exotic people were young developers like Frank van Cappelle, a Dutch national who is a doctoral candidate at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education in Australia. His app, StatPlanet, lets people explore more than 3,000 World Bank economic indicators with interactive maps and graphics. It won the $15,000 first prize.

One finalist was an app to help pregnant mothers use their mobile phones to find World Bank data about maternal health in their countries and languages. Another was a game designed to increase awareness of deforestation.

Mr. van Cappelle says the contest encouraged people to make sense of the bank’s information. “There’s a lot of data out there right now locked up in databases,” he says, “and I think it requires apps like this one and some other apps that have been developed to unlock that prison.”

The World Bank promoted the contest partly to remind its own employees that the old barriers are coming down.

“You know, we could have had a hundred smart people sitting here for a year and never come up with a lot of that stuff,” Mr. Zoellick says. The bank, he says, is essentially widening the circle of people it can brainstorm with.

Having created models for open-sourcing and crowd-sourcing, the bank is now moving toward mash-ups. A new Mapping for Results program offers interactive maps pinpointing locations of almost 3,000 bank projects in more than 16,000 places worldwide. Links open up pages with information about each project, and users can add overlays that show, say, where infant mortality is highest to see whether the bank’s work in those areas matches the need.

The program is sensitive because it involves releasing data provided by client governments and others, but the hope is that it will prompt these parties to link their own data on economic and social development to the site or otherwise make it available.

THE Swedish government, a big public supporter of development projects, has followed suit with a prototype, a Web site with information about where it spends its aid money and the impact its spending has had. “The goal is to achieve as effective poverty reduction as possible,” the Swedish government said this year in announcing the effort. “To achieve this goal, development cooperation must be opened up to transparency and ideas from others.”

Next week, Kenya, too, will open a Web site giving access to data that, until now, has existed largely in books on the shelves of various ministries. Software developers are already playing with it — seeking patterns like whether there is any correlation between the government’s spending on schools and students’ test scores, literacy and matriculation.

“The World Bank has made it easier with what it is doing with open data,” says Bitange Ndemo, Kenya’s permanent secretary for information.

The broader release of such data will enable more “scientific” policy-making, cut down on corruption in Kenya and engage more people in government by empowering them with knowledge they can use to challenge political leaders, he says.

Asked if there would be resistance to public dissemination of government data, Dr. Ndemo said transparency was inevitable.

Information is valuable, he says, and people will find a way to get it: “This is one of those things, like mobile phones and the Internet, that you cannot control.”
70 2011-07-03 Or a franchise that stacks “Crawford money” players into its lineup like pizza boxes in a frat house against one that by its own admission is “bleeding cash” and already has a payroll it can’t afford before factoring in a certain $1 billion lawsuit.

Yes, the Mets have handsome Citi Field and a cable network in a baseball-crazed metropolis. But the continuing financial quagmire of the Family Wilpon makes the Mets a franchise more likely to jettison primary assets than retain them. Until further notice, they are a small-market body in big-market clothing.

That means parlaying assets into future options. Like it or not, that is the Mets’ competitive predicament, if not the worst one the owners find themselves in.

Already this season they have agreed to package a third of the team in a desperate deal to David Einhorn, a hedge fund manager out of Milwaukee, or Commissioner Bud Selig territory. If Einhorn’s sudden entry was Selig’s means of orchestrating his friend Fred Wilpon’s graceful exit and a transfer of majority ownership is imminent, then Reyes could still be a centerpiece of a stable ownership moving forward.

But if Wilpon is intent on riding out the storm and the goal of the next few years is survival, then the Mets can’t spend so much on one position, and for a player who has struggled to stay on the field.

Against the odds, the Mets have hung near .500 despite being hit hard by injuries. But the Yankees, too, have suffered health-wise, especially on their pitching staff, and they are in first place in the American League East with the second-best record in baseball.

For all their resolve, the Mets began Saturday six and a half games out in the National League wild-card race — and finished it one and a half games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates.

One American League executive recently told me he would lean toward trading Reyes in the Mets’ situation, given Reyes’s reliance on his legs, his history of leg injuries and the franchise’s obvious need to cut payroll.

Reyes’s one at-bat Saturday was a study of risk and reward. With his electric speed, he led off the home first by beating out a roller to Robinson Cano at second. But he felt the hamstring tighten halfway down the line. When Manager Terry Collins found out, he had two words for his shortstop: “You’re out.”

Referring to the dugout mood, Collins said, “The air came out of the bubble.” And though it wasn’t Reyes’s historically troublesome right hamstring, and he said he didn’t think the injury was severe, it is problematic when your collective breath must be held every time your franchise player rounds a base.

Even with Reyes healthy and having a career year, the Mets were gradually putting themselves in the same unenviable position of those N.B.A. franchises with premier players who came to wonder if they could contend for a championship given the competitive limitations of their longtime addresses.

Reyes recently rebuffed the Mets’ offer to begin negotiations for an extension, using the familiar refrain that he didn’t want to be distracted with contract talks during the season.

Was he telling the truth? Has he forgotten or forgiven Wilpon’s free-agent forecast? Did it motivate him to become “the world’s greatest”? (How long will it take A-Rod to immortalize the red-hot Eduardo Nunez — no offense intended to a certain Yankee legend?)

Maybe the moral of Saturday’s story was that it is too soon to draw conclusions with a long second half of the season to go and another month to the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline. Right now, it’s the classic conundrum. Everyone loves Reyes, whose multiple skills are so attractive in the bright New York lights. If only the Mets were still operating like a major Broadway production and could afford such a luxury.
71 2011-07-03 Since 2008, 23 states have passed new laws, or updated old ones, to enable people who lost their rights to buy and possess firearms for mental health reasons to petition to have those privileges restored.
72 2011-07-03 At a different time of year, the whitewashed shack that is Harry’s Place might be mistaken for a farm stand or carnival booth. But not between St. Patrick’s Day and Halloween, when the wooden panels of its hatch windows are slung open and customers line up for the burgers and dogs that have made Harry’s a drive-in destination.

Harry’s Place, established in 1920, may be the least ostentatious of businesses to bear a National Register of Historic Places plaque. Yet the hordes who are drawn to it daily are there for the eats, not its historic significance. Fortunately, the parking lot is capacious, and even on the busiest of days, the umbrella-shaded picnic tables out front and those set under the maples and birches of the grass-covered yard behind the building should provide plenty of space for everyone.

Harry Schmuckler of nearby Salem was the Harry who opened the joint, though he sold it in the 1930s and it has been run by the Garet family since 1978. While the bread-and-butter sales remain griddle-fried quarter-pound patties and crispy-skinned frankfurters (starting at $3.39 and $2.55, respectively, with plenty of extras available), Harry’s Place offers a large selection of comfort foods.

At the high end is a lobster roll ($14), a plentiful blend of buttery claw and arm meat served in a griddle-toasted roll. Also available are corn chowder ($3.60), lobster bisque ($4) and fried clam bellies (market price). And among an army of sides are crispy crinkle-cut fries ($2 to $2.25) and house-made potato chips ($2.50). Perhaps most surprising of all, Harry’s offers Wi-Fi, with the daily login code posted by the front window. CHRISTOPHER BROOKS

73 2011-07-03 Mr. Champion pulled his scooter into the safety of the gutter, and Anjali towered above him, standing on the high edge of the cracked sidewalk. She hadn’t seen much of her former teacher in the twelve months since she’d graduated from Vasco da Gama High School and enrolled in Vasco da Gama College’s B. Comm. program. During that time he’d grown a reddish beard speckled with gray. A patched book bag was slung over his shoulder, and he still wore his trademark handloom cotton kurta over blue jeans. From her elevated vantage point, she saw that his hair was thinning. Mosquitoes buzzed over the bald spot. They landed, but he appeared not to notice.

He had to be over fifty, considering that he’d been in Bihar for nearly thirty years, but was still so slim and energetic that he seemed boyish. All American men — within the tiny compass of her experience — seemed boyish. Her father, a railway clerk, was younger than Mr. Champion but looked older. It was impossible to think of her stout father, with his peremptory voice and officious manners, in anything but the role of upholstered patriarch. He would never wear a wrinkled shirt in public or shirtsleeves to the office, and he had never owned blue jeans.

"I thought you were leaving," the American said. Then, with more emphasis, "In fact, I thought you told me you were leaving, and that was months ago."

When in doubt, smile. She smiled. "I like your beard, Mr. Champion."

"I’m not your teacher anymore, Anjali. You can call me Peter."

"Only if you call me Angie."

She’d had a secret crush on her teacher her last three years at Vasco da Gama High School, though, like all other da Gama students speaking to teachers, she’d addressed him as sir and Mr. Champion to his face, and as "the American" behind his back. He was the only layman under sixty and the only white man in the school run by Goan and South Indian priests.

"Angie, why are you still here?"

It was a question she often asked herself. She could more easily visualize herself in a fancy Mumbai café overlooking the Gateway of India, stirring a foamy pink falooda with a long spoon in a frosty glass, than nibbling spicy savories from a street vendor in Gauripur, something she had been about to do when Mr. Champion startled her.

"I might ask the same of you, sir — I mean, Peter," she retorted, grateful that her lips and chin weren’t greasy from eating deep-fried pakoras.

"Same as you, Angie. Studying."

It was their special joke: although he earned his living as a teacher, one in fact openly admired for having introduced a popular course on U.S. business models and advertising strategies with supplementary units on American culture and idiom, he considered himself "a perennial student." But not like typical Indian students, those driven rote learners with one obsessive goal: admission to an Indian Institute of Technology. A lifetime of prosperity and professional success or poverty and shame depended on how relentlessly they crammed for national entrance examinations.

"I thought you said you had to get out if you wanted to stay sane."

"There were weddings." She lied. "My sister got married. I couldn’t just pick up and leave." A spontaneous untruth; it just slipped out.

He frowned and she felt a liar’s momentary panic. Maybe she’d already used the wedding excuse, and forgotten. Family weddings and funerals are the incontestable duties and rituals of Indian life. There’s always a sister or cousin being married off, an ailing uncle being nursed, a great-uncle being mourned.

Truthfully, Angie had a sister. Her name was Sonali, and she had been married five years before to a bridegroom whose ad and picture in the matrimonial column of a Bangla-language local newspaper had met Sonali’s, and their father’s, approval. Now Sonali was a divorced single mother, living with her four-year-old daughter in a one-room flat in Patna, the nearest large city, and working as steno-typist-bookkeeper for the stingy owner of a truck-rental company. The bridegroom was discovered, too late, to be a heavy drinker and philanderer. But when Sonali had finally got up her nerve to institute divorce proceedings, their father had turned against her for wreaking on the Bose family the public shame of divorce.

How could she explain to Mr. Champion how difficult — how impossible — it was for a daughter in a family like hers to just up and leave town except as the bride of a man her father had hand-picked? Why did family honor and fatherly duty involve his shackling her to a stranger when he had already proved himself so fallible? It was her life he was threatening to ruin next. Her father had a simple explanation: "It is not a question of happiness, yours or ours. It’s about our name, our family reputation." Even at nineteen, Anjali was determined not to yield her right to happiness.

Mr. Champion, oblivious to what she had to contend with at home, was back to smiling. Maybe all Americans were inscrutable in that way. You couldn’t tell what they really thought. Maybe he hadn’t noticed her little lie; maybe he’d noticed but forgiven her. She sailed through life with a blithe assumption that she would be forgiven.

"Remember what I told you. India’s leaving towns like this in the dust. You’ve got prospects." He shifted a heavy jute shopping sack strapped to the back seat of his scooter and patted the empty space. An overripe orange tumbled out of the bag into the gutter. Two crows and a pariah dog zeroed in on the smashed fruit. "Hop on, Angie."

If Gauripur was that doomed, why hadn’t he left?

"I’ll give you a ride to your house if you don’t mind stopping off at my place while I put this stuff away." He retightened the strap around the jute sack. "There’s fish at the bottom."

She liked the idea of not having to go right back home to her father’s bullying and her mother’s tearful silence. They were obsessed with finding a respectable son-in-law who would overlook negatives such as green eyes, a stubborn personality, and a nominal dowry. Her father blamed her for his lack of matchmaking success. Usually he pointed to her T-shirts and jeans: "What you wear, how you talk, no wonder! What good boy is going to look twice?"

Plenty, Baba, she could have retorted but didn’t. She was not lacking for admirers. Boys were attracted to her, though she did little enough to encourage them. She knew what her father meant, though: prospective bridegrooms — "good boys" from good families — would back off.

With her sandaled toe, Angie traced a deep dent on Mr. Champion’s scooter. The strappy sandal was the same shade of lilac as her painted toenails. She knew she had pretty feet, small, high-arched, narrow. He had to have noticed. "Looks like you need a new set of wheels, Mr. Champion," she teased.

The American wiped the passenger seat with the sleeve of his kurta. "Don’t wait until it’s too late."

He didn’t understand her struggles; how could any aging, balding American with tufts of nose hair do so? She had one, and only one, legitimate escape route out of Gauripur: arranged marriage to a big-city-based bridegroom. That B. Comm. degree would increase her stock in the marriage market.

"Okey-dokey, Mr. Champion." She laughed, easing herself in place beside the jute sack on the passenger seat. Let the sidewalk throngs stare; let the crowds part for the young unmarried woman on the back of the bachelor American’s scooter. When the word got out, as it inevitably would, that Anjali Bose, daughter of "Railways Bose" of Indian Railways, sister of a working-woman divorcee, was riding off in plain sight, with her arms around the stomach of a foreigner, her parents would find it harder to make a proper-caste Bengali matrimonial match for her. So be it.

"And I’ve got someone I’d like you to meet," he said.

"You are inviting me to go to your flat, Mr. Champion?" She tried not to sound shocked.

It would not be her first visit to her teacher’s home. Mr. Champion offered an English conversation course on Saturday mornings, and an advanced English conversational skills course on Sunday afternoons, at his apartment. Anjali had completed both courses twice, as had a dozen ambitious male da Gama students hoping to improve their chances of getting into professional schools in engineering or medicine or business management. A few of Mr. Champion’s students were now doctors in their early thirties, waiting for immigrant visas to Canada or Australia.

The very first time Anjali showed up for Mr. Champion’s Saturday conversation class, she had been severely disappointed with how little he owned in the way of furniture and appliances. No refrigerator, no television, no air conditioner, no crates of carbonated soft drinks. He owned a music system, professional-looking tape-recording equipment, and a bulky laptop and printer. Wooden office chairs and a pile of overstuffed cushions served as extra seating. Dozens of Indian books in every language were stacked on a brick-and-plank bookcase. A divan that surely doubled as his bed was pushed alongside a wall. Anjali had expected a professor’s home to be shabby, but a shabby portal of learning, crammed with leather-bound books by world-renowned authors.

Anjali had been the only girl in those classes. She had been brought up to revere her elders and teachers, but whenever she visited Mr. Champion’s place, she’d imagined his shame: the rooms were so barren, so like a servant’s quarters. Some Saturday afternoons the sheets on the divan still looked mussed. She was embarrassed to be in a room with a man’s bed, with his clothes hanging from pegs on a wall as though he had undressed in front of her. His apparent loneliness depressed her; his exposure agitated her. The silence of Mr. Champion’s room made the beehive drone of an Indian family seem less insane. She was not much of a homebody — according to her mother’s complaints — but if it hadn’t seemed too forward a gesture by the only girl student, she would have brought her teacher small house gifts, a flower vase or just a wall calendar, to make the room look cozier.

Now terra-cotta pots of blooming flowers lined the narrow walkway to Mr. Champion’s back staircase. Vines hung over the stairwell, and the stairs themselves were fragrant with flowers she couldn’t name in any language. Could it be the same place?

"Mr. Champion! Have you gotten married?" She laughed, and from the top of the stairs he turned to her with a smile.

"Some difference, wouldn’t you say?"

The door was painted bright blue. It opened inward before he could even insert the key. By then, Anjali had gained the top step, and there she faced a young man wrapped in a lungi, bare-chested, rubbing his eyes. "Jaanu," he said in a low voice, and Mr. Champion said a few words in what sounded like Urdu. Angie made out the universal "tea" and "biscuits" and maybe a version of her name.

There were cut flowers on a round table, a colorful tablecloth, and paintings nailed to the walls. There were two comfortable-looking cane chairs and a floor lamp. An old wooden almirah now held the clothes that had been hung on pegs, and bookcases ran along every wall, right up to the sleeping alcove. The bed was not made, almost as though the boy had been sleeping in it. She didn’t see his sleeping mat. "Angie, this is Ali," said Mr. Champion. Then he added, "He is my friend."

Americans can do that, she thought: make friends of village Muslims. Young Ali, Mr. Champion’s jaanu, his life (if the Hindi and Urdu words were congruent in meaning), a handsome enough boy if nearly black, with long hair and flaring cheekbones, had painted his fingernails bright red. He opened the almirah to find a shirt for his half-naked body. Either the shirt had been donated by Mr. Champion but still hung in the master’s closet, which was cheeky enough — or else the two men shared closet space, which to her was unthinkable.

Mindful of parental wrath if she was to return home on the back of a man’s bike, Anjali insisted that she would stay only a few minutes and then take a bus back. If Baba or the nosy neighbors saw her get off the bus at the stop close to home, they would suspect nothing. She wasn’t ready for a screaming match with Baba. But she stayed an hour, speaking more freely of her longings than she did with her girlfriends. She didn’t want marriage. Her classes were dull. She wanted something exciting, life-changing, to save her from the tedium of Gauripur. "I understand," Mr. Champion said. Ali was sent off to buy sweets. Angie had been Peter Champion’s fondest project, someone very much like him, he said, who couldn’t live in the small town of her birth. What a pain it is, to know that one is somehow fated to set sail for the farthest shore. "What a calling it is for someone like me," he joked, "to fill that ark with passengers."

Mr. Champion was in high teaching mode, in full confessional self-display. He was, he said, a man in love.

"So that explains the woman’s touch," she said. "But where is she?"

She wondered for a moment if she herself was the woman he’d chosen and if the next words from his mouth would be "I love you, Angie, I always have, and I won’t let you leave until you agree to go to America as my bride　.　.　." She had a romantic nature; she assumed any man could love her.

Bravely, she asked, "So who is this person you want me to meet?"

She was left in the dark, still smiling. She hadn’t seen anybody, and there was no place to hide.

"It’s too late for me to leave," he said, "but for you I want the best." Is this a proposal, she wondered, and almost asked out loud, trying to help him. I’ll do it! I’ll make you happy! Then he said, "You must try a larger city." She’d always imagined herself in Bombay or maybe on the beaches of Goa, and so she mentioned those possibilities to him. Eventually, even in America, she thought, though she dared not say it for fear of inviting the evil eye.

"Bombay?" He laughed. "You’ve been seeing too many bad movies. Bombay is yesterday. It’s a hustler’s city. Bangalore’s the place for a young woman like you."

She wondered, Is that where he’s taking me? Why not? I’ll go. Then: What kind of girl am I?

She knew nothing of Bangalore, a southern city as alien to her as the snows of Kashmir. Mr. Champion was back in teaching mode. He explained that for two hundred years Bangalore had been a British army base, a cantonment, and the Britishers had left a few scars — golf courses and racetracks and private gymkhanas — that moneyed Indians adopted a little too enthusiastically. But now it’s a hopping place. And he had contacts in Bangalore, people who would listen to his recommendations. The call centers, luring thousands of young people from all over the country, people like her, the new people.

"In Bangalore," Mr. Champion said, "if you’ve got the talent, there’s a market."

This time she asked the question that was always on her mind. "And what is my talent, Mr. Champion?"

"Peter, please. Don’t you know what your talent is?"

"Foggiest, Angie. Initial f-sound, not p. Initial w-sound, not v, and vice versa. Wedding, not vedding. Vagaries, not wagaries. Not wice wersa. Develop, not dewellup. Keep practicing."

She could cry. They’ll always find you out.

"Your talent, Angie? You have the passion. You’re not satisfied. But you’re still very innocent. Innocence is appealing in a young girl, but not blindness, not ignorance. Look at us." She smiled at his way of including her, but then he said, — "Look closely at us, Angie, take a long look at Ali and me."

At the mention of his name, Ali smiled and began to dance. The boy was a good dancer; he must have seen a hundred movies. And then Peter stood and put his arm over Ali’s shoulder, and Ali nestled his head against Peter’s cheek.

A clash of emotions met the dawn of consciousness: she could have screamed, but instead she whimpered, barely above a breath, "Oh."

Peter went on about places in Bangalore where she could stay. He knew old women from the British days who let out rooms in old mansions in the middle of the city, houses that could have been sold for crores of rupees (and leveled, their tangled gardens hacked down for parking lots and swimming pools), but where would the old women go? Old Anglo-Indian women whose children had fled to Australia or Canada, whose grandchildren would never see India, dotty old women whose sense of decorum reached back to pre-Independence days and who ("Believe me!" he laughed) would never be sympathetic to India’s freedom fighters and Independence, but who nevertheless offered rooms and breakfasts of tea and toast and suppers of mutton stew at 1970s prices. Much was forgivable in such women. A place in Kew Gardens or Kent Town, that’s what Angie needed. And he knew the women who ran the new money-spinning call centers were always looking for girls with good English and soothing voices who could fool American callers (I can do that? she was about to ask. I’m good enough to fool Americans?) into thinking they’re talking to a girl in Boston or Chicago.

"Finally, a chance to use those regional accents I taught you," he said. "You’re very good, Angie, you’re the best student I ever had."

"That’ll be five dallars," she said, remembering.

Chicago o’s sound like a’s. So do Boston r’s.

"I told you at graduation you had to leave this place before you got trapped in a rotten marriage. I’m telling you again, let that happen and you’re as good as dead."

Why do they say as good as dead? Why not as bad? But this was not the time to ask. He seemed about to put his hand on her arm and she felt excited. "I have dreams for you. You get married to some boy from here, and the dream dies. You’ll never see the world." He studied her T-shirt. "No　.　.　. Dortmund, no Bratislava. You’ll have kids and a husband who’s jealous of your intelligence and your English and won’t let you out of the house, and that would break my heart." This time, he did put his hand on her arm — "You understand?"

Ali snapped up the plate of sweet crumbs as though it was crawling with ants and noisily dumped it into a bowl of soapy water. He was jealous of her! He was just a child. He lifted his dripping fingers to eye level and glared at a chip on a painted fingernail.

"All I’ve done is give you a start. The rest is up to you."

In the movies, there was a moment of accounting. She wouldn’t be allowed to leave her benefactor’s house, not without a favor, or worse. The rest is up to me? The door would be blocked. He’d reach for her hand, then close in on it, like a trap. But Peter was her teacher and a teacher’s help had purity and noble intentions behind it. It came from his heart because she had earned it honorably. Peter was smiling and even Ali was smiling, and Peter held out his hand to her and said, "Good luck, Angie."

She took his hand. Ali thrust out his, which confused her: shake a servant’s hand? Up close, she could see a fine line of kohl limning his eyes. In that moment of confusion she saw Peter’s arm reach around Ali’s waist and pull him close. "I hope you’ll find happiness too," he said.

More words followed, in Urdu, and Ali laughed and said in English, "Good luck, Anjali."

Then he walked her to the bus stop.
74 2011-07-03 Dramatic stories of hardship and injustice have always been at the center of the struggle for racial equality. Homer Plessy refused to ride in a segregated black train car in late-19th-­century Louisiana; the World War II veteran George Dorsey and three other African-­Americans were killed by a racist mob outside Atlanta in 1946; Emmett Till was lynched by white bigots in Mississippi in 1955; and in that same year, Rosa Parks sparked the Montgomery bus boycott when she would not surrender her seat to a white passenger. These events and many others inspired activists to press for change and convinced average Americans that change was necessary. The worst abuses of the Jim Crow era have been eliminated, but the moral outrage inspired by a personal encounter with a bigot remains the most powerful vehicle for conveying the injuries and indignities of racial inequality. Accordingly, civil rights lawyers seek out plaintiffs whose grievances reflect larger in­justices, and activists rally around people who symbolize pervasive social problems.

In his 1993 book, “The Rage of a Privileged Class,” the journalist Ellis Cose followed in this tradition, using numerous interviews to show that even wealthy and successful blacks suffered innumerable slights, insults and unexpressed prejudices that left them with an enduring frustration and pessimism. But much has changed in the intervening years, most conspicuously the election of a black man to the presidency. In “The End of Anger,” Cose confronts a more complex and at times contradictory America. Drawing on a series of interviews with former participants in A Better Chance — a program that helps talented, underprivileged students attend elite prep schools — and with African-American alumni of the Harvard Business School, Cose tracks changing race relations in the post-civil-rights era. He finds that the glass ceiling has been shattered and the anger and resentment that seemed a permanent feature of the black experience in the 1980s and ’90s have yielded to a new optimism, which has survived the recession and the racist invective of the Tea Party. This isn’t simply irrational exuberance — the afterglow of Obama-mania. Instead, Cose sketches a picture of steady historical and generational change in which growing optimism among blacks is a natural response to waning racial bigotry among whites.

Cose names each generation of Americans to reflect improving race relations: the black “fighters” of midcentury America were succeeded by the civil rights “dreamers” of the late 20th century, who are now sharing power and prominence with the “believers” of the new millennium. Not coincidentally, midcentury white “hostiles” gave birth to post-civil-rights-era “neutrals” and, now, Obama-era “allies.” The generational scheme is oversimplified, but it offers a useful heuristic device for understanding the evolution of race relations. Cose’s collection of intergenerational interviews provides tangible evidence of the improvement in racial dynamics over the last 50 years: the contempt and blatant discrimination suffered by the fighters and dreamers giving way to the inter­racial relationships and expanded job opportunities of the believers.

Nevertheless, any account of American race relations is at best a good news/bad news story. Even successful blacks still feel they must work harder than whites to get ahead, and a host of invisible but potent institutionalized impediments blocks the path of the less fortunate. “The End of Anger” takes an extended look at the sometimes deliberate targeting of minority households by banks peddling subprime mortgages, and the tragic consequences of decades of punitive criminal penalties for poor blacks. But personal stories cannot depict institutionalized inequality, inadvertent discrimination and subtle prejudice as readily as they can dramatize the outrages of Jim Crow-style bigotry. It’s often hard to tell in any particular case whether an individual injustice has occurred or who is to blame for the patterns of inequality that define today’s most dire racial problems. People of all races were seduced by loan officers pushing subprime mortgages, and sometimes such loans were a family’s only chance at home­ownership. Similarly, every unsuccessful job interview doesn’t involve prejudice. And in some cases tough criminal penalties are both necessary and justified. So Cose supplements interviews with subprime mortgage borrowers and struggling ex-­convicts with statistical analyses, and he interviews lending officers and social service workers — people who can speak to broad patterns of inequality. Statistical disparities show that racial inequality remains a problem, and careful analysis of lending practices, hiring patterns and law enforcement reveals systemic biases. The combination of interviews and academic studies works, although those studies are not as absorbing as the testimony of an indisputably aggrieved victim.

In the discussions of racial politics and civil rights, the interview-­driven approach faces more severe limitations. Unlike a firsthand account of a moving experience, the calculated statement of a public figure doesn’t speak for itself; it demands critical analysis. But as a good journalist, Cose is reluctant to editorialize about his subjects, leaving the reader struggling to distinguish spin from reliable evaluation. These chapters contain some interesting details about the career paths of movers and shakers like the former Tennessee congressman Harold E. Ford Jr. and the N.A.A.C.P. president, Benjamin Jealous, but for the most part Cose’s subjects — well-­established leaders with relatively conventional platforms and constituencies — give predictable interviews. Politicians speak of reaching across racial lines and connecting to voters from all walks of life — a no-brainer in today’s cosmopolitan society — and the section on civil rights ends with the anodyne consensus that activists should “adopt a much broader agenda.” What institution doesn’t want to expand its scope and influence?

In order to respond to the racial in­justices of the new millennium, the civil rights movement will have to do more than broaden its agenda. It will need to change it, putting less emphasis on conspicuous racial animus and more on opaque, systemic and often inadvertent causes of inequality, spending less time and energy on cathartic public demonstrations and more on mundane questions of institutional design. Individual stories of injustice will always be affecting, but it may not be possible to capture the impersonal causes of today’s most severe and pervasive inequalities with a personal narrative. This — not how to bring more people and more causes under the civil rights banner — is the movement’s most pressing test. As Cose remarks, “The challenge facing civil rights groups . . . will be convincing the public that the battle for civil rights is anything but a relic in this age when . . . old-fashioned racism grows weaker by the day.” In a sense, Cose faced a similar challenge in writing “The End of Anger”: how can one make the more complex racial problems of today as compelling as the un­ambiguous bigotry of the past?
75 2011-07-03 From the E-Mail In-box of Bill Keller: 



I appreciated your Sunday column titled “The Tom and Jerry Problem.” While I am confident of Sarah Palin’s disdain for the so-called mainstream media, I think you may be overanalyzing her comment that “it is our vets who we owe our freedom — not the politician, not the reporter — it is our vets, so that’s why we’re here.” In this case, I believe she is simply paraphrasing a famous poem. I know the poem well; I was made to memorize it while a cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy several years ago. In it, the poet proclaims, “It is the Soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press.”

NATE VAN LOON, Tampa, Fla.

As is clear with most people who’ve never been around the military, you missed something of great significance. Sarah Palin rolled that phrase out so easily because it’s repeated 10,000 times a day in conservative circles. It’s part of our culture that you don’t know much about. When I say “our culture,” I mean conservative culture. It is so completely foreign to folks like yourself we often wonder if we’re even in the same country. I would recommend any journalist, before looking at diversity outside our borders and in our cities, look at the diversity in their own people who don’t think like them. Take a year off and live in the South near a military base. Become immersed in conservative culture, and you just might find your ivory tower is a rather lonely place to live.

KRIS BRADDOCK, Belleville, Ill.

Are all you liberal pseudo-elite journalists really this stupid? Or have you all just deluded yourselves into thinking the American people are the stupid ones?

MARTIN FEE, Vero Beach, Fla.

You write that only 21 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Sarah Palin. If you had the press constantly attacking you and putting you under the magnifying glass and all that was reported was negative press, perhaps no one would find favor with you, either. Had your fellow media colleagues given Barack Obama the same treatment as you have given Mrs. Palin, no one would care for him either.

DAVID FLORES, Tucson

I am just a semiretired accountant in central California. You are an elitist twit, pouring out bile because you cannot stand Sarah Palin. You quite obviously feel imperiled by her ability to connect with people in fly-over country. We in fly-over country get it. Why don’t you?

76 2011-07-03 Mr. Glazman has a three-bedroom farmhouse with a six-stall barn and tack room on five acres for $475,000, as well as a 34-acre farm with 18 stalls and 10 paddocks for $1,795,000. “The problem is, in the current market, even at the lower price range, most buyers today look at horses as very expensive toys, and we’re feeling that,” he said.

In general, the farther away from Midtown, the less expensive the property. “Some of my clients have looked in Westchester, but there aren’t as many large tracts available there, and taxes are higher,” Mr. Glazman said. “As a result, places like Warwick have become viable alternatives, especially for people who work from home and only commute to Manhattan two or three days a week.”

High property taxes and land costs notwithstanding, Bedford remains highly sought after by affluent horse owners, largely because of its proximity to Manhattan, said Alfie Rechichi, the manager of the Katonah office of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.

The agency has listings for smaller four-stall properties for under $1 million, as well as a 22-acre estate with 10 stalls for $8 million in Bedford Corners that was once home to the internationally famous dressage horse Flim Flam. Several years ago, the property was on the market for $13 million.

Bedford’s attractions for horse owners include 160 miles of bridle trails maintained by the Bedford Riding Lanes Association, a 91-year-old nonprofit group. These add “value to a property, the way having a swimming pool or tennis courts would,” said Robert Torre, the chief executive of the 500-member organization.

These days, many Westchester horse farms — especially in the Bedford area — are bought by individuals who work in the financial industry in Manhattan and have a family member who is “very into horses,” said Ghy Manning, the owner-broker of Vincent & Whittemore.

“It’s a way of life up here for many people,” Ms. Manning said. “They’re buying their dream, their passion.”

Vincent & Whittemore has a 96-acre dream called Birdstone Farm in nearby Cross River, with 20 stalls and an indoor arena, $18,995,000.

Not enough room for your warmblood mares? The agency also represents Grand Central Farm in North Salem, which has 286 acres, 20 stalls and two foaling stalls with heat and cameras, among other things. It is listed at $24,900,000.

But development pressures have been intense in Westchester, and according to the county Planning Department, agricultural activity declined steadily between 1983 and 1994, when nearly 4,000 acres, or 36 percent of farmland, were lost. In response, the County Board of Legislators created the Westchester County Agriculture and Farmland Protection Board in 1999.

The nonprofit Westchester Land Trust in Bedford Hills works with landowners to preserve farmland. As Anthony P. Cutugno, a senior vice president of luxury properties for Houlihan Lawrence and a member of the land trust’s advisory board, said, “We can’t afford anymore to break up properties into a thousand small pieces.”

“You can still occasionally find a horse farm in Purchase or Armonk or Chappaqua, but when you get into Bedford you really feel them,” he said. “You can see foals this time of year running through the fields, and it only gets better as you go north. But that way of life is like an endangered species.”

Kristen Carollo, the owner of the 32-acre Courtyard Farm in Bedford Hills since 2001, has established an easement on the property, ensuring that it will remain open space forever, according to Susan Carpenter, the director of land preservation for the land trust.

“I don’t want to ever see houses where this farm is,” Ms. Carollo. “It took so much blood, sweat and tears to build our place, and I want to make sure it will always be here.”
77 2011-07-03 When the playwright Michael Weller heard that Karen Allen wanted to direct his 1970 play, “Moonchildren,” at the Berkshire Theater Festival this summer, he was wary. “I thought, ‘Oh, she’s an actress, she’ll just want to work with the actors.’ But the first thing she said was, ‘I want to talk to you about the order of the scenes,’ ” Mr. Weller recalled. “She was just dramaturgically so astute.”

Ms. Allen, perhaps forever to be known as Marion Ravenwood, the love interest of Indiana Jones in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” is directing professionally for the first time, though she said she has been ready for a while. “There’s always been a part of me that was very much interested in working as a director, but you end up sort of feeling like you can’t straddle both,” she said.

Ms. Allen, 59, was speaking from her home in Great Barrington, Mass., where she definitely straddles a few worlds. She has not worked extensively in film for some time (though she did reprise her role of Marion in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008), but she teaches and directs at Bard College at Simon’s Rock. She first directed “Moonchildren” there, she said, because she often looks for plays with young characters for her students. Ms. Allen has a whole other career too, running Karen Allen Fiber Arts, a design studio and store where she creates sweaters and other knitwear.

She opened the studio in 2003, she said, when she wanted to “be in one place, so my son could have a life and go to school, and I could be a support system.” Now her son, Nick, 20, is working as a chef. “I feel like It gives me an opportunity to go back into the theater and work in film and theater both again,” she said.

84 2011-07-04 But Reyes is considered day to day after straining his left hamstring in the Mets’ 5-2 loss to the Yankees on Saturday. Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ general manager, said the Mets would decide whether Reyes would be allowed to play in the All-Star Game.

The Toronto Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista, who leads the majors with 27 home runs, received the most votes in fan balloting. Bautista’s total of 7,454,753 was a record, surpassing the 6,069,688 votes received by Ken Griffey Jr. in 1994.

The Yankees led all teams with six representatives, with Robinson Cano, Derek Jeter, Curtis Granderson and Alex Rodriguez voted in as starters.

The Philadelphia Phillies aces Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee were on the N.L.’s pitching staff.

In New York, the absence of Sabathia and first baseman Mark Teixeira may have been viewed as glaring, but Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox and Andrew McCutchen of the Pittsburgh Pirates were among the most notable omissions.

Carlos Beltran, whose inclusion would have seemed unlikely, at best, at the start of the season, joined Reyes as the other Met on the N.L. roster. Beltran has experienced a renaissance after being nagged by knee problems since 2009, and will be a part of his sixth All-Star team.

“From the first day he showed up in spring training, he’s been one of the most professional people I’ve been around,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said of Beltran. “I’m so happy for him. For a guy we were hoping would play three days a week, he’s on the All-Star team. That tells you the way he’s approached it.”

A club-record three players will represent the Milwaukee Brewers in the N.L. starting lineup: Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder and Rickie Weeks. Braun was the league’s top vote-getter with 5,928,004.

The All-Star mainstays Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners and Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals will both miss the game. Suzuki had been an All-Star each year of his career, which dates to 2001, but is hitting .272 this season.

Pujols, a nine-time All-Star, is on the disabled list with a broken left wrist. He has 17 home runs and an uncharacteristically low .279 average.

The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox accounted for six of nine starting spots for the A.L. Aside from their starters, the Yankees’ other representatives were catcher Russell Martin and closer Mariano Rivera, who will be making his 12th All-Star appearance.

Sabathia did not seem bothered by being left out. He pointed out that he was scheduled to start the Sunday before the game, which would disqualify him from participating. Sabathia said he would make personal plans for over the break.

“I felt like I’ve had a pretty good first half,” Sabathia said when asked to assess his All-Star credentials. “There’s a lot of good guys pitching, though. Guys are having great years, so I’ll just keep going.”

The fans voted for 17 starters, which includes the designated hitter for the A.L. team. The remaining 49 players were selected through a combination of player voting and picks made by the manager of each All-Star team.

Two players will be added to each team through an online fan vote that runs until 4 p.m. Thursday.
85 2011-07-04 Over the weekend, European ministers agreed to finance Greece through the summer but deferred crucial decisions on a second bailout.

After a two-hour conference call late Saturday, the finance ministers from the 17 euro zone countries said they would sign off on an 8.7 billion euro, or $12.6 billion, loan to Greece, part of a 110 billion euro package agreed upon last year. The board of the International Monetary Fund was expected to approve its part of this installment, 3.3 billion euros, or $4.8 billion, within days.

Without the loans, the Greek government faced the prospect of insolvency in weeks. But with Greece still struggling to shore up its finances, European finance ministers also need to put together a second package of loans to help it through 2014. That bailout is expected to amount to 80 billion to 90 billion euros but, because of conflicts over the extent of private sector involvement in the effort, the package may not be agreed upon until September.

Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said that the new program could “be completed before the release of the next tranche in the autumn — provided, as always, that the implementation of the program in Greece takes place as planned,” Reuters reported from Berlin.

“Greece has enough cash over the summer so the very acute worry that Greece would be unable to pay in July has gone,” said Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels. “But Europe has not been proactive for some time, and it will probably remain in strong crisis management mode over the next few weeks.”

Constrained by the unpopularity of bailouts at home, political leaders appear able to act only at the 11th hour, when they have no alternative, Mr. Véron said.

“The E.U.’s institutions are not effective, and the bigger the crisis, the less effective they are,” he said. “Discussion is driven by governments accountable to domestic constituencies and not to the E.U. as a whole.”

The twists and turns of the crisis and the whipsaw market activity are making it tough for some hedge funds to maneuver.

While it is possible that a hedge fund received a hefty payday from betting that the euro would rise in value against the dollar or that Greece would not default on its debt, no big winners have emerged, several hedge fund investors and managers said.

Only nine out of the more than 300 hedge funds tracked by HSBC’s private bank through mid-June showed double-digit returns this year, and the best-performer, Jat Capital, which bets on high-flying technology and Internet stocks, was up about 19 percent. In a separate survey, hedge funds tracked by Lyxor Asset Management showed that almost every fund across nearly every strategy lost money in June.

Some investors said that many hedge funds appeared to have sat out much of the euro zone crisis, particularly in bets involving Greek sovereign debt, concluding it was a “no-win situation,” said Gerlof de Vrij, the head of the global asset allocation team at APG Asset Management in the Netherlands, which oversees $395 billion in investments for seven Dutch pension funds.

“If you were long Greece, your investors are going to ask, how could you be long? Why didn’t you see all the difficulties? And if you’re short, people will blame you for being a speculator and for all of the problems the country has,” Mr. De Vrij said.

Those sentiments were echoed by Philippe Jabre, the former star trader of British hedge fund GLG, who now oversees Jabre Capital Partners, which is based in Geneva.

“The hedge fund industry, in general, is being sidelined because we know things will be tougher, we’re just not sure where it’s going to come from, so we’re trying to reduce our exposure,” Mr. Jabre said. He noted, for instance, that his firm had reduced its holdings of European banks.

“The problems could come from stocks, could be bonds, could be banks, could be the illiquidity of the market or a change in the short-selling rules. All of these things could come back and hurt hedge funds,” he said.

Concerns that European regulators could suddenly ban short selling or take another unusual step to shore up their banks caused Pedro de Noronha, the manager of the $63 million Noster Capital Fund in London, to close out short positions, or bets he had made that European bank shares would fall, some time ago. He positioned his fund instead to bet that the sovereign debt of emerging-market countries could run into trouble.

“The problem with being short the European banks is that politicians will do everything they can to save them,” said Mr. De Noronha. “You’re fighting against people who can change the rules of the game in the middle of the game.”

Still, investors say hedge funds were active as much as 12 to 18 months ago in putting on positions through credit default swaps — contracts that would pay out in the event of a default — to benefit from rising concerns about the fiscal health of Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

As the price of those contracts became too expensive, some hedge funds moved into credit-default swap contracts for the sovereign debt of larger, more stable European countries, like Germany or even France, betting that those contracts could become more valuable. Others used credit-default swap contracts to bet that certain European banks that held Greek debt would run into trouble.

In June, amid the Greek crisis, the cost to insure Greek sovereign debt more than doubled from a year ago while the cost to insure German sovereign debt was virtually the same, according to Markit, a financial data business in London.

“I don’t think Germany is going to default, but I think the threat of default is going to increase massively,” said Mark Yusko, the president of Morgan Creek Capital Management, which invests in hedge funds.

Investors say hedge funds that bet the euro would tumble in value against the dollar, as countries in the euro zone came under pressure from high debt levels and low economic growth, had losses as the euro rose against the dollar.

“There were hedge funds who viewed that the Greek problems might lead people to question the survival of the euro as a common currency,” said Eric Weinstein, who oversees $4 billion in investments in hedge funds at the asset manager Neuberger Berman. “They shorted the euro, believing it would drift lower towards a possible breakup,” he said. “Those who shorted the euro versus the dollar have had that trade work against them as it has gotten stronger.”

Mr. Halet and Davide Serra, a former financial analyst star with Morgan Stanley, co-founded Algebris in London in 2006, and decided to focus strictly on investing in global financial stocks.

Some bank stocks have been under pressure from potential losses and downgrades from the ratings agencies because of the Greek debt they hold. In addition, investors have worried the additional capital requirements that regulators in the United States and Europe are demanding to shore up the banking systems and prevent broader systemic risk will sharply reduce profits.

Still, the Algebris co-founders said the market overreacted to those concerns.

“The market has been very concerned and very spooked about the possibility of a Greek default in July, whereas the decisions that have taken place in the last three weeks made that outcome less likely,” Mr. Halet said in an interview before the Greek Parliament voted last week.

“Yes, we do have exposures to European financials. We are not doing great,” he said. “But we’re not doing worse than many other hedge funds.”
86 2011-07-04 Ireland comes to Midtown Manhattan in two eccentric new shows opening 59E59 Theater’s fall season. In September Cirque de Légume, a clown duo from Dublin, will use vegetables and physical comedy to create what the company calls “pure mayhem.” The Inis Nua Theater Company of Philadelphia will mix commedia dell’arte, Japanese Kabuki theater and mime to present “Dublin by Lamplight,” a story of poetry and politics at the National Theater of Ireland in 1904. In October a large church in a small town will become the center of controversy in “The Bus” by James Lantz, followed by “Any Given Monday,” an irreverent comedy about a man trying to save his marriage through terrible means, by Bruce Graham, a former writer for the television show “Roseanne.” Last — but certainly not the least draw for 59E59 audiences — the popular “Brits Off Broadway” returns to the theater for its eighth New York program. Before the season begins, Throughline Artists, a company that promotes communication between established and emerging playwrights, presents “Summer Shorts 5.” This festival of short plays brings new works by Alexander Dinelaris (“Still Life”), Christopher Durang (“Miss Witherspoon”) and Neil LaBute (“reasons to be pretty”), among several other playwrights, beginning Aug. 4 and running through Sept. 3.
87 2011-07-04 Mr. Cornyn, a member of the Senate leadership, also said that Republicans would be open to a short-term deal on the debt ceiling to provide more time for a comprehensive agreement.

“The problem with a minideal is we have a maxi-problem,” he said. “And the big problems aren’t going to go away if you cut a minideal. All it does is delay the moment of truth. And so I’d say better now than then. But if we can’t, then we’ll take the savings we can get now, and we will relitigate this as we get closer to the election.”

The White House had no comment on the senators’ remarks.

Last week, President Obama harshly criticized Republicans lawmakers for refusing to eliminate tax breaks like those for private jet owners, hedge fund managers, multinational oil companies and ethanol producers. He argued that eliminating such loopholes could save billions of dollars and help fix the short-term federal deficit and long-term national debt.

The administration and Congressional negotiators are racing to find a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling of $14.3 trillion by Aug. 2, when the Treasury Department says the United States will exhaust its ability to borrow money and could default on some obligations. A bargain must be struck at least a week before then to provide time for a Congressional Budget Office analysis and for both chambers to vote on it.

Mr. McCain said Sunday that closing the tax breaks that Mr. Obama mentioned would have a negligible impact on the nation’s fiscal condition and would defy the will of the voters.

“The principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last November, and the result of the election was that the American people didn’t want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending,” he said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”

He added that his fellow Republican senator from Arizona, Jon Kyl, a member of the budget negotiating team, had said there were certain measures that Republicans would consider, and that he was open to them. He refused to name any.

Mr. Kyl said he would be willing to consider some increases to help bring down the deficit. “We’re perfectly willing to consider those kinds of issues in the context of tax reform, which we would very much like to do,” Mr. Kyl said last week on “Fox News Sunday.” “But we’re not going to have the time to do it or be able to do it in order just to raise revenue as part of the exercise, which should be about reducing spending.”
88 2011-07-04 MANCHESTER, England — What’s a rock songwriter — Damon Albarn, of Blur and Gorillaz — doing composing an opera about an Elizabethan alchemist? The best answer might be: conjuring.

“Dr Dee: An English Opera,” created by Mr. Albarn and its director, Rufus Norris, had its premiere on Friday night at the Palace Theater here as part of the Manchester International Festival, which commissioned it along with the English National Opera and London 2012. Its title character, John Dee (1527-1608 or 1609), was the historical figure who was probably a model for Shakespeare’s wizard Prospero and for Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus.

Dee was a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, navigator, book collector, philosopher and proponent of empire for an expanding Britain. (Much of Mr. Albarn’s career, from the Britpop of Blur to the global pop eclecticism of Gorillaz, has contemplated the end of that empire; the opera reconsiders its beginnings.) Dee also sought to communicate with angels and was convinced by one scryer (crystal-ball gazer) that he was divinely instructed to share his wife. He was an adviser to Elizabeth I, but her successor, James I, spurned him. In his later years Dee had his library pillaged and his reputation tarnished by accusations of occultism; he died in poverty. Mr. Albarn, in an interview, described the opera’s story not as a tragedy but as “a melancholy.”

It helps to know Dee’s story, which flashes by in Mr. Norris’s elegantly hallucinatory staging, suggesting an era that did not divide the natural from the supernatural. In a defining scene Dee (Bertie Carvel) declaims a geometry proof backed by a drumbeat that hints at Elizabethan dances, while drawings and figures swirl around him on scrims.

Francis Walsingham (the baritone Steven Page), Elizabeth’s principal secretary and spymaster, consults Dee over the astrology of her coronation date during a chess game with moves made by black, beak-headed dancers straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Later, when Walsingham repudiates Dee, Walsingham reappears as a taller, more ominous figure on stilts. Elizabeth, after she is crowned, rises above the stage with long trains of golden fabric that become a protective canopy over her subjects’ lives, including Dee making love with the wife who will later tempt the scryer.

As the opera progresses, Dee’s obsession with learning deepens; he immerses himself in books, separating himself from the events taking place around him. Mr. Norris’s staging makes book pages, spread across the stage as accordion-pleated barriers and backdrops, a central visual theme.
89 2011-07-04 When I saw “Three Hotels” Off Broadway in Greenwich Village 18 years ago, the intimate space there seemed appropriate for a work that uses the stage as a confession box. The Williamstown production features a series of detailed rooms (by Thomas Lynch) that speak suavely of the expense accounts of their inhabitants. These are big spaces for a lone performer to fill.

The expanded scale makes sense thematically though, and Mr. Weber and Ms. Tierney don’t get lost in space. It is clear from the play’s beginning — which finds Ken in Tangier, Morocco, on a mission to clear out “the deadwood” from his company’s international upper staff — that the play’s characters have been made, well, small by the professional world through which they move. And the loneliness of a man and woman who are estranged not only from each other but also from their own deeper selves is emphasized by the antiseptic vastness of their surroundings.

Ken is a rising star for a company that sells baby formula in third world countries. (He amends dryly that “developing nations” is the officially preferred term.) The company has been held up to public censure on “60 Minutes” for its part in the deaths and illnesses (through misuse of the formula) of African children. Ken has been doing damage control, a process that has demanded that he learn to see people as less than human, less than real.

Ken of course wasn’t always like this, and his wife, Barbara, mourns the death of the husband that was. (The play’s second scene, which takes place during a weekend company meeting in the Virgin Islands, is hers; Ken’s concluding monologue occurs in more modest digs in Mexico.) It turns out that he grew up the son of Jewish lefties, and he and Barbara were in the Peace Corps together. And, yes, he once said that it was people like them who would change this old world, and, yes, she believed him.

You see what I mean about this being a young-sounding play? What keeps “Three Hotels” this side of a diatribe, on the one hand, and a soap opera, on the other, is Mr. Baitz’s understanding of the carapaces that people develop when they are forced into long-running ill-fitting roles in life.

His script is rich in the wise-guy flippancy and sardonic brittleness that Ken and Barbara, respectively, have adapted for coping with what they have become. These styles embody attitudes that have grown into reflexes and have almost pushed out other, more natural feelings. I say “almost” because there is anger lurking not far beneath the surfaces — a rage exacerbated by the violent death of their only son several years earlier — that means both spouses are wired to self-destruct.

Ms. Tierney and Mr. Weber are best known for their work in television (she for “ER,” he for “Wings”). But nothing in their performances here suggests that their rhythms have been irretrievably set by short takes and retakes. They create, as they must, a sustained, fraught dialogue within their characters and with their physically absent spouses.

Mr. Weber is especially good at both displaying and dismissing, in one breath, the “manufactured thugishness” that his job has taught him. (He’s a tad forced in his climactic breakdown in the final scene.) And Ms. Tierney turns in a beautifully modulated, low-key performance that consistently and quietly taps the anguish that is always in Barbara, when the temptation would be to open the faucets.

Though it holds the attention, “Three Hotels” doesn’t quite feel like a full meal. (It didn’t when I first saw it either.) Mr. Baitz was still in his “promising” phase, which — to be honest — he seemed to inhabit for the succeeding decade and a half. His subsequent variations on the themes of love among the ruins of moral bankruptcy (including in 1996 “A Fair Country,” whose main characters and situations were a reworking of those in “Three Hotels”) were broader but never quite fully realized.

Then came Mr. Baitz’s “Other Desert Cities,” seen Off Broadway in a Lincoln Center production in January, a play that combined his poet’s ear and sociologist’s eye with a new confidence and sense of balance. It is satisfyingly complete. This made watching “Three Hotels” a more pleasant experience than it might have been otherwise. I knew there were better things to come and could luxuriate in how those dividends (to use Ken’s capitalist language) are anticipated here.

90 2011-07-04 TOKYO — Boeing’s long-delayed 787 completed its maiden trans-Pacific journey this weekend and landed in Japan, where the more fuel-efficient jet will undergo testing this week with All Nippon Airways in preparation for its first commercial use.

The plane, called the Dreamliner, touched down at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport from Seattle early Sunday to applause and a white “Welcome to Japan” banner held by flight attendants and workers. Two fire trucks shot out celebratory arches of water as the aircraft approached the hangar.

ANA even offered a live video feed of the landing on Ustream. As of Sunday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 37,000 times.

The pilot Masayuki Ishii said he stayed calm during the flight but grew emotional upon landing and seeing the excitement on the ground.

The 787’s much-anticipated arrival marks the near-end of a long wait by ANA, the first customer in line for the next-generation aircraft. Boeing missed the initial May 2008 delivery goal and has repeatedly delayed its introduction because of problems in development.

The twin-engine jet is made mostly of carbon fiber and other composite materials instead of aluminum, making it lighter and 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other mid-sized airliners, according to Boeing.
91 2011-07-04 On Tuesday, the Air Transport Association of America, an industry group, and some major American airlines — United and Continental, which merged last year, and American — will appear at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to argue against the way the system will be applied by Britain.

As home to London Heathrow and other busy airports, Britain has the highest carbon dioxide emissions from aviation in the union, making it essential to the union’s regulation system.

A decision by the court supporting the American airlines would damage the initiative, European regulators and European airlines say, because the involvement of foreign carriers is critical. An advisory opinion could come within months, with a final judgment possible before the system comes into force in 2012.

Lawyers for the American carriers are expected to argue on Tuesday that the system conflicts with the Chicago Convention, an international accord that gives countries sovereignty over their airspace, and with the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty. The airlines also are expected to attack the cost of the system and the lack of firm guarantees that revenue would be used for climate protection.

Seeking to ease the dispute, European officials have emphasized that they will exempt incoming flights if other countries take “serious measures” to reduce emissions that would be considered equivalent by the union. European officials also began discussions with national governments on introducing rules requiring them to use the revenue from permits to tackle climate change. But they say delays are out of question.

“We are not thinking at all about the possibility of changing our legislation,” José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said last month. “All the world should unite in some kind of directive like this one.”

European officials said that they had moved ahead with the law when a United Nations body, the International Civil Aviation Organization, had failed to agree after more than decade of talks on an international system for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft.

What is clear is that by charging airlines for their carbon emissions, the European Union would do more than protect the climate. The system could be lucrative for countries, like Britain, with busy airports and ballooning budget deficits.

Britain already generates about £500 million, or $800 million, annually from auctioning permits to polluting industries under the union’s emissions trading system, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, a government-financed body that operates independently.

It could generate a further £80 million next year from airlines, while nations across the union could net about 480 million euros, or $695 million, according to rough estimates by bankers and analysts.

Airlines say that some of the money they will spend on carbon permits will end up subsidizing struggling governments.

“Countries like Britain have reserved the right to use the money how they see fit,” said Nancy Young, a vice president at the American trade group. “Helping Europeans out of their fiscal hole is not the aviation industry’s job.”
92 2011-07-04 They still might.

The poor start, the mocking newspaper headlines like “A night without altitude,” by the Argentine daily Clarín, hurts. “It’s not what we expected,” admitted Messi. “We must improve to win our remaining matches. We need tranquility.”

Tranquility is the least likely ambience they are going to get. Looking ahead to Wednesday, when Argentina meets Colombia in Santa Fe, the home team needs a performance that defies the name by which the stadium is commonly known.

It is officially called Estadio Brigadier General Estanislao López. But locals know it as “El Cementerio de Los Elefantes,” the Elephants’ Graveyard.

Surely not this time. Surely Argentina will demonstrate that the struggle in La Plata was more to do with opening-night nerves, the typical, tight, tied opening encounter we get in many a tournament.

Santa Fe, up in the northeastern corner of the country, is as close to home as Messi gets in this tournament. It is also familiar territory to a young man, Éver Banega, a central midfielder who is possibly the key player in Argentina’s search for a style to suit the current generation.

Banega, 23, is the closest thing Argentina has in this squad to a fantasista, a playmaker. Without one of those, all the forward running of Messi, of Tévez , of Ezequiel Lavezzi — or of any of the reserves: Ángel Di Maria, Sergio Agüero, Javier Pastore, Gonzalo Higuaín and Diego Milito — is wasted.

Messi takes the stick because Messi is Messi. On Friday, he had to do what he seldom has to do with Barcelona, to forage deeper and deeper in search of the ball. Nobody was providing it, nobody was establishing a rhythm. Bolivia, coached by an Argentine, stoically and stubbornly filled the midfield and denied Argentina’s renowned forwards the space to be effective.

In that sense, bully for Bolivia. It is a small neighbor, its players largely unknown outside their own league. And moments before halftime, Bolivia dared to hit the giant on the nose.

Its goal was a piece of impudence, a back heel from Edivaldo Rojas that slipped under the feet of Banega on the goal line. Rojas is a player born in Brazil, naturalized in Bolivia. Every team, it seems, has one of those.

By the time Agüero, a substitute, volleyed a splendid equalizer, the crowd had turned on Argentina, on the stranger Messi, on the national team coach, Sergio Batista.

It is the paying customers’ right to vent their feelings on a home team’s inability to stop Bolivia from doing what it had never done before, take a point in Argentina.

But this is not, yet, the time to panic. The Copa is a 12-nation tournament, and eight teams go through to the next round.

The natives grow restless not simply because of the result, but because they fail to see what Batista sees in the formation and philosophy he espouses. Hired when Diego Maradona was fired after the all-out attack was exposed by Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Batista is a man of order compared to Maradona, a man of whim.

The attack, attack, attack instinct of Maradona, at times as thrilling as it was basic, could not in the end take Argentina far. But Maradona at least knew that offense, and definitely not defense, was what is in the soul of his players.

Batista, a midfield anchor in his playing time, makes no bones about what he wants. He talks of Argentina performing in the manner, the tactical style, of the world’s finest team, Barcelona.

Messi, of course, is the cherry on the top of Barça’s all-conquering entertainment.

His brilliance looks like genius in the attacking third of Barcelona’s balanced 4-3-3 formation.

It can look forlorn, almost hopeless in Argentina’s attempt to replicate that lineup.

That is because Barcelona has Xavi Hernández, but Argentina has no one comparable. Xavi is the pivotal point of his club, and of the Spanish national eleven, because his eye, his brain and his feet can so precisely measure the passes that fantastic forwards need to make their runs.

Where is Argentina’s fantasista? Batista is clearly hoping it lies within Banega. The 23-year-old is growing into that role for Valencia, but Banega is attempting to tread where more recent Argentine playmakers — Juan Sebastián Veron, Juan Román Riquelme, Pablo Aimar — have failed to convince.

You might have to go back all the way to 1978, to the midfield generalship of Osvaldo Ardiles accompanied by the flair of Mario Kempes, to truly recall Argentines who could control and invent matches the way that Xavi or the Dutchman Wesley Sneijder do today.

Banega, flanked by the defense-minded Mascherano and Esteban Cambiasso, has a long way to go to be in that class.

If he makes rapid strides during this tournament, we may yet see the strikers of Argentina go all the way to the final on July 24 in Estadio Monumental. If not, all could end in tears — or once again in tear gas, as it did after River Plate was relegated last week, in the capital of a land that cries out for soccer success.

101 2011-07-05 The star of the new campaign is a bulldog named Benny, who accompanies his owner, Mark, on several excursions around Los Angeles and its environs in their red 2012 RAV4; Benny’s thoughts are heard in a voiceover.

In one of the campaign’s two 30-second TV spots, Benny says he and Mark “were in the RAV4, it was a rough day. Got into a scuffle with the poodle across the street. It’s a dog thing. Anyway, Mark decided we should flip the script and go on a road trip.”

The two pick up Mark’s friend, Nina, load the car with a few items, and drive off, playing music on the car’s MP3 player while passing through mountain scenery. Later, as Mark and Nina sit holding hands and looking up at the starlit night sky, Benny says, “As always, the RAV handled the journey like a dream and we got to see something that would stay with us for the rest of our lives. I even forgot about the poodle. I love that day. It was one of my favs.”

In the second TV spot, Benny says “one day Mark, the RAV4 and me were chillin’, right ya know, ridin’ down Broadway. The sun was shinin’, that’s when Mark had a great idea.”

Mark then picks up three friends, they load the RAV4 with a grill, cooler and folding chairs, and Benny puts his bone in a well in the floor of the rear of the car. As the group dances on the beach at an impromptu party, Benny says, “We headed to the one spot that could top it all off. You know what I mean?” Drinking out of a doggy bowl with an umbrella in it, Benny concludes, “Yeah, that was a good day.”

In a 30-second radio spot, Benny announces, after barking and clearing his throat, “I’m Benny and yep, I’m a bulldog. Me and my owner Mark are best friends, and with RAV4 we’re a crew! RAV has everything, available third-row seats, great gas mileage, 73 cubic feet of cargo space with a secret compartment where I can store my doggy bone. Mark was even smart enough to get the value package, which includes a moon-roof and a JBL 9-speaker system. Now we don’t take walks, we ride.”

The two TV spots end with “Toyota, moving forward” — the manufacturer’s advertising slogan — while the radio ad ends with “Toyota, moving forward, baby.”

The TV ads will run on BET, TV One, TBS and TNT, while the radio spot will run on programs like the “Tom Joyner Morning Show.”

On July 11 Toyota also will introduce digital and mobile ads featuring Benny in the RAV4; with banner advertising and rich media, these will run on sites like BlackAmericaWeb.com and Myxer.com.

Ms. Warden said her agency opted to have a dog star in the campaign because Benny was a “memorable character, and provides an interesting way in. A dog allows us to speak to men and women, and we’re targeting both.”

She said the African-American car buyers that Toyota was trying to reach with the campaign were 25 to 49 years old, “active, youthful, with fairly old-fashioned values, some college education” and a household income of over $50,000. Introduced in 1996, the RAV4 is now in its third generation, and has a base price of $22,475.

Awareness of the vehicle is “a big part of our goal,” Ms. Warden added. “We want to make sure our target knows about it, understands its functionality. That’s why we wanted to call out the cargo space, comfort, acceleration and miles per gallon.”

According to industry sources, Toyota will spend $5 million to $10 million on the new advertising through early 2012.

112 2011-07-05 A prominent rights lawyer was sentenced to nine years in prison and barred from working as a lawyer for 10 years after he was convicted of seeking to overthrow the ruling system, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported Monday. The lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, a founder along with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, represented activists and opposition supporters arrested after the disputed 2009 presidential election. He said he would appeal.
113 2011-07-05 A charter fishing boat with 44 people aboard sank into the Sea of Cortez off Mexico on Sunday, leaving at least one person dead, the United States Coast Guard said. Eight people, seven of them Americans, were still missing late Monday night.

“Initial reports from Mexico are that it was bad weather and possibly waves,” said Lt. Sean Groark, a spokesman for the Coast Guard. “We’re focused on really trying to save people. The water temperature in the Sea of Cortez is very warm, the air temperature is really warm; that increases the chance of survival. It actually increases it a lot.”

Twenty-seven Americans and 17 other passengers and crew members were aboard the boat when it foundered at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, about 60 miles south of the port of San Felipe, the Coast Guard said. Many were able to swim ashore, and they alerted local authorities that the ship, the Erik, had gone down. Others were rescued by the Mexican Navy.

The Associated Press reported that the accident occurred on the second day of a weeklong trip, which was an annual Fourth of July ritual for many of the people on the boat.

The company that operates the boat, Baja Sportfishing Inc., said in an e-mail message: “We are devastated by this horrible tragedy.  Every effort is being made to assist the authorities in the search.  Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families.”

Michael Ng of Belmont, Calif., told The A.P. that he and another fisherman were rescued as they tried to paddle toward the shore, using a cooler to help keep themselves afloat.
114 2011-07-05 The police have charged Tareque Rahman, elder son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, of masterminding a grenade attack on an opposition political rally in 2004 that killed 23 people, the police said Monday. Mr. Tareque and several others were accused of plotting the attack, the country’s worst case of political violence.
115 2011-07-05 LONDON — The voice-mail account of a British schoolgirl who went missing in 2002 and whose murdered body was discovered six months later was repeatedly hacked by the News of the World tabloid at a time when no one knew what had happened to her, a lawyer for her family said Monday.

According to the lawyer, Mark Lewis, the newspaper not only intercepted messages left on the phone of the girl, Milly Dowler, 13, by her increasingly frantic family after her disappearance, but also deleted some of those messages when her voice mailbox became full — thus making room for new ones and listening to those in turn. This confused investigators and gave false hope to Milly’s relatives, who believed it showed she was still alive and deleting the messages herself, Mr. Lewis said.

In a statement, Mr. Lewis called the newspaper’s actions “heinous” and “despicable” and said the Dowler family had suffered “distress heaped upon tragedy” upon learning that News of the World “had no humanity at such a terrible time.”

The British prime minister David Cameron, while on a visit to Afghanistan, put more pressure on the newspaper on Tuesday, calling the allegations shocking. ‘‘If they are true, this is a truly dreadful act and a truly dreadful situation,’’ he said, according to comments carried by The Associated Press.

The disclosures, reported first in The Guardian, came as part of a broader police investigation into News of the World’s routine practice of intercepting the cellphone messages of celebrities, politicians and other public figures in the mid-2000s. The newspaper has admitted that it did so in some cases, and has paid damages to the actress Sienna Miller and others. Numerous other people who say that their phones were hacked are suing the paper.

But the revelations about Milly Dowler are significant for two reasons. The first is that the alleged hacking in this case occurred in 2002 — five years before News of the World’s chief royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed along with Glenn Mulcaire, an investigator hired by the paper, after they were found guilty of intercepting the phone messages of members of the royal family. The Dowler case is the first to indicate publicly that similar behavior had occurred before.

The second is that in 2002, the editor of News of the World was Rebekah Brooks, a confidant and favorite of Rupert Murdoch, whose corporation owns the paper. Ms. Brooks, who is now chief executive of News International, the British newspaper division of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, has always denied knowing anything about phone hacking at any Murdoch-owned papers. In an e-mail she sent to employees on Tuesday, she repeated that assertion, The Guardian reported.

“I hope that you all realise it is inconceivable that I knew or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations,’’ she wrote in the e-mail. She also said, “It is almost too horrific to believe that a professional journalist or even a freelance inquiry agent working on behalf of a member of the News of the World staff could behave in this way.’’

If Mr. Lewis’s accusations about hacking during the Dowler case prove accurate, it would mean either that Ms. Brooks had no idea how the paper she edited was obtaining information about the Dowler family for its articles, or that she knew about the hacking and allowed it.

Evidence that News of the World had hacked into Milly’s cellphone and into the phones of her family members was found in notebooks belonging to Mr. Mulcaire that were turned over to the police as part of a wider investigation, The Guardian reported.

Mr. Lewis told the BBC that the police had notified Milly Dowler’s parents that “News of the World, or Glenn Mulcaire, was hacking into Milly Dowler’s phone while she was a missing person.”

“You have to ask the question: who was at the News of the World thinking it was appropriate to try and hack into the phone of a missing young girl, and what was Glenn Mulcaire thinking of at the time to take those instructions?” he said. “Both of them should have had common decency, moral right, to turn around and say, no, they weren’t prepared to do that.”

In a statement, News of the World said it was cooperating with the police and added, “This particular case is clearly a development of great concern.”

And in her e-mail, Ms. Brooks said: “If the allegations are proved to be true then I can promise the strongest possible action will be taken as this company will not tolerate such disgraceful behaviour.’’
116 2011-07-05 “For the first time in this economic cycle, there is going to be a fair number of disappointments,” said Doug Cliggott, an analyst at Credit Suisse, referring to the earnings reports. “The economy is going to be without those drivers.”

Europe’s debt crisis may be far from over. Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, said on Monday that a plan promoted by France for French and German banks to roll over their large holdings of Greek government debt would in fact amount to a default by Greece, raising questions about how the indebted nation could qualify for a much-needed second bailout.

On the other hand, some analysts are predicting a relatively rosy United States profits season that belies the continued grim domestic economic news. They think companies will do well, since consumers have made some progress in trimming their debt and may be prepared to start spending again. Energy prices have at least stopped going up.

“We are going to get good news out of the corporate sector and markets can move higher,” said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan.

The 5.4 percent jump in the Dow Jones industrial average last week, in one of its strongest weeks in two years, seemed to support that optimism.

Already some investment professionals are predicting that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index may be back at 1,400 or higher by year-end, if not sooner; it closed at 1,339.67 on Friday. Some are making comparisons with last year, when after a few rocky months markets touched lows in the first week of July — and soared for most of the rest of the year.

“With the exception of the bust of late 2008/early 2009, U.S. stocks are now the cheapest they have been in 20 years,” Steve Sjuggerud, editor of True Wealth, an investment newsletter, wrote in June. He forecasts that the S.&P. 500 will be back at 1,450 by year’s end.

But the bears believe that optimism is overdone.

In addition to Europe’s troubles, they point to continued poor United States economic numbers.

Last month the Federal Reserve revised its expectations for economic growth down to a range of 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent, from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April. Many independent economists are more pessimistic. There is a risk that the economy will struggle further from budget and job cuts at the local and state levels, and even at the federal level, depending on the debate about the debt ceiling.

A further drag could be the end of the Fed’s $600 billion asset buying program, which had been buoying stocks since last fall.

Companies had been socking away profits by, among other things, keeping down labor costs and increasing productivity, but their profit margins may now be squeezed as both their unit wage costs and investment spending begin to rise.

Credit Suisse expects the stock market to end the year below its current level, with the S.&P. 500 at about 1,275.

“Analysts are expecting blockbuster earnings numbers, but I am not so sure,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “We have a defensive strategy.”

Mr. Kleintop said corporate leaders would most likely reduce their earnings guidance for the second half of this year when they announce their results for the second quarter.

The early earnings reports have been mixed. FedEx reported net income up 33 percent for its fourth quarter, which ended May 31, compared with the same quarter a year earlier — heartening the bulls who see the company as a good bellwether for the rest of the economy.

Frederick W. Smith, FedEx’s chairman, said in a conference call with analysts that the economy had been through a brief soft patch.

“We believe that the near-term softness in the economy will be temporary as fuel prices have retreated from their April highs and the Japanese economy recovers,” he said. “Going forward we see stronger economic growth.”

Nike reported strong gains in sales, especially in the key North America and China regions. But Oracle’s earnings for the last quarter disappointed markets with subdued demand for computer hardware.

Other companies have provided some whispers about what might be coming by issuing preannouncements that provide guidance on whether their results will be better or worse than they had previously signaled.

According to Thomson Reuters, out of a total of 125 companies in the S.& P. 500 providing guidance through preannouncements, 81 were negative as of the end of June and 33 positive — a higher negative-to-positive ratio than at the same time last year.

Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, said the consensus among Wall Street analysts was for annual growth in operating earnings among S.& P. 500 companies of 15.6 percent in the second quarter, led by energy and materials companies.

This is strong growth but still represents a slowdown from the annual rate of 19.7 percent in the first quarter and 37.7 percent in the fourth quarter. In the whole of last year, operating earnings advanced 37.9 percent.

“We feel the economy has likely downshifted because of a combination of Japan and commodity prices — it is a fragile economy,” said Mr. Stovall, who is forecasting the S.& P. 500 index to be around 1,350 by year’s end.

The reporting season will begin in earnest with results from the large Wall Street banks. They are likely to reveal an especially bruising quarter because of the choppy markets and subdued borrowing by households and companies.

Analysts have been rushing to take down their estimates. John McDonald, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, said both stock and bond trading revenue for the biggest Wall Street banks could be off about 20 percent from a year ago.

More traditional banking did not fare much better. New regulations have ratcheted up expenses and are also starting to chip away at once-lucrative income streams, like overdraft charges on checking accounts and credit card penalty fees.

The banks are also bracing for a multibillion-dollar hit on the fees they collect from debit card transactions, despite some relief when the Federal Reserve released its final rules last week.

Higher capital requirements, meanwhile, could put pressure on some banks to lighten their balance sheets.

The fragile economy has made consumers and businesses more hesitant to take out new loans. That, along with low interest rates, has hurt lending profits. Mortgage income is expected to be sharply lower than a year ago, when a surge in refinancings helped prop up the banks’ results.

The bulls should get a boost in the middle of the reporting season when big industrial companies that have large sales abroad are likely to show continued strong growth, helped by fast-growing emerging economies.

“The industrial sector is holding together well, supported by the emerging economies,” said Nick Kalivas of MF Global. “I don’t detect any material slowdown.”

The strength of the euro against the dollar compared with a year ago should also help companies with large revenues coming from Europe.

But at the close of the reporting season, retail companies may once again underscore the continued depressed state of the American consumer — and provide a downward pull on the market.

According to Mr. Kleintop of LPL Financial, the bulls and the bears will eventually have to compromise.

“In the end these two camps will come together,” he said.
117 2011-07-05 Stocks rose in Europe, and Greek two-year notes advanced for a fifth day on Monday after officials approved an aid payment to Greece to prevent a default.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent, while Canada’s Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 0.6 percent. United States markets were closed for the Independence Day holiday. Thai stocks jumped the most in 14 months after the opposition won elections.

The Greek two-year note yield dropped below 26 percent for the first time since June 14. Zinc rose 1.4 percent while oil climbed 0.1 percent to near a two-week high.

Stocks pared gains after S.& P. said a rollover plan serving as the basis for talks between investors and governments would qualify as a distressed exchange and prompt a “selective default” rating.

The gain in the Stoxx 600 extended last week’s biggest rally in almost a year. Canadian stocks rose for a fifth day, the longest streak of advances in six weeks, led by commodity producers.

Greek two-year yields slid 73 points to 26.11 percent, at one point dipping below 26 percent to 25.76 percent. The euro advanced less than 0.1 percent against the dollar and dropped less than 0.1 percent versus the yen.
118 2011-07-05 The 2008 financial crisis revealed many of the world’s banking regulators to be woefully ineffective. Sheila C. Bair’s five years at the helm of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which end on Friday, may offer a potential exception. A potted banking regulator’s version of the 1989 self-help book, “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” sums up Ms. Bair’s tenure.

¶ Know your goals and limitations. The F.D.I.C. has some advantages over other watchdogs. Its clear remit is to protect bank depositors’ interests, and it is financed by premiums levied on banks rather than being beholden to Congress. A major goal is to minimize losses to its insurance fund. Though increased premiums can bring in more money over the long term, the agency’s short-term tools are limited to transactions with the private sector and the bully pulpit. Ms. Bair used both to the fullest.

¶ Nurture private capital. When the crisis forced the F.D.I.C. to shut down banks, it needed to bring in private sector money to recapitalize the sector. It wasn’t easy. Investors like the private equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus had already been burned. But early on, the F.D.I.C. engineered the sale of IndyMac’s assets to J. C. Flowers, Paulson & Company and others, and the purchase of BankUnited by a group led by the banker John Kanas. These helped entice private money, and eventually healthy banks, into the sector.

¶ Minimize giveaways. The IndyMac and BankUnited deals looked, in retrospect, too sweet for the buyers. BankUnited tripled its backers’ money when it went public early this year. But the F.D.I.C. swiftly closed the door on easy pickings, a decision that had private equity firms howling. By then the flow of private capital was under way, and despite less attractive terms the agency was able to sell other failed banks. Ms. Bair’s team even found a way to claw back some of the upside on some deals.

¶ Stand up to bankers. Ms. Bair was never one to shrink from a fight with bankers — or other regulators. The fact that she made so many adversaries may be a virtue of its own. Ask Vikram Pandit, the Citigroup chief executive. The F.D.I.C. played a pivotal role in upending Citi’s attempt to buy Wachovia in October 2008. As Citi’s negotiators quibbled over the details of their $1 a share purchase backed by government guarantees, Wells Fargo swooped in with a $7 offer without state help. Ms. Bair not only egged on Wells, she informed Wachovia’s chief of the bank’s bid.
119 2011-07-05 Over the course of an unglamorous but productive career, the trumpeter-composer-arranger David Weiss has drawn sustenance from one source above all others: the postbop vanguard of the late 1960s and early ’70s, a music of elasticity and bravura. His approach typically suggests a hands-on sort of advocacy.

He was the architect of a late-career boost for Freddie Hubbard, the postbop trumpet paragon, who died in 2008. He’s the driving force behind an all-star group called the Cookers, featuring veterans of Hubbard’s era. From time to time he presents a tribute to a single musician, or even a specific album. His composure as a trumpet player often takes a backseat to his diligence as an organizer.

And at first glance Point of Departure, his band, might seem like just one more iron in the fire. Named after a celebrated postbop album by the pianist Andrew Hill, it plays music largely in that vein. Last year the group released an album on Sunnyside called “Snuck In,” recorded during an early set at the Jazz Standard and named after a tune by the unheralded Detroit trumpeter Charles Moore. “Snuck Out” comes from the late set on the same engagement, with another version of that tune (a makeup studio version, actually).

Sounds redundant, right? Not where it counts. Point of Departure consists of Mr. Weiss and the industrious tenor saxophonist J. D. Allen, along with a flexible young rhythm section: Nir Felder on guitar, Matt Clohesy on bass and Jamire Williams on drums. The band functions at the higher levels of postbop slipperiness, staying away from too-obvious material: two of the five pieces on “Snuck Out” are Mr. Moore’s, from the unjustly obscure Kenny Cox album “Multidirection,” released on Blue Note in 1969.

The band — in particular, the rhythm section — addresses this music with an air of feverish discovery, and only the most permissive sort of reverence. “Gravity Point,” by Mr. Moore, spins out from a tightly dissonant horn line into swirling improvisation; “Paraphernalia,” by Wayne Shorter, stretches even further. Mr. Felder leads the best of these digressions, and like his teammates he sounds thrillingly unrestricted. Whatever Mr. Weiss meant with the name of this band, he named it well. NATE CHINEN

Lloyd would have been a world-killer in 1983, when soul was lightweight and slick, and all of the politics had been squeezed out. He has one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary R&B, a beautiful coo that rarely pushes harder than a whisper, and rarely has to.

As it happens, Lloyd’s fourth album, “King of Hearts,” arrives in another era of slack-voiced soul men, like Chris Brown and Trey Songz, both of whom appear on this album. But while neither is a heavyweight, each outmuscles Lloyd, threatening his delicate ecosystem.
120 2011-07-05 “A dealer is probably a better place to go, but with the economy like it is, I come here,” Mr. Perez, 37, said. He had his eye on a blue Ford Explorer chalked for $5,500. “At a dealer, this car would cost double,” he said.

Local residents and business owners, however, complain that car dealers clog traffic and hog parking spaces, which are hard enough to come by with five million cars on the road in Los Angeles County.

“They park in front of the businesses and just leave the cars there all weekend, so the customers trying to come in and shop in the area have nowhere to park,” said Eddie Carvajal, owner of M&M Furniture on Pacific Boulevard. “Even when they take a car for a test drive, they pull another vehicle into the space so they don’t lose it.”

Though it is illegal to operate a car sale business without a license in California, county officials call the law almost impossible to enforce.

The dealers hang around in a nearby park, playing cards or lying on park benches, waiting for customers to call. County officials say they bring the cars in from mechanic shops and nearby dealerships, in hopes of moving vehicles that have not sold. Many of the cars have the same phone numbers listed on them. Mr. Carvajal said sellers sometimes dropped cars off on tow trucks, two or three at a time.

When the dealers saw a photographer snapping pictures of the chalked windows, they quickly wiped the prices off all the windshields. They all denied they were selling cars — one man polishing a car ran away when a reporter approached him, and five others in the park said they were waiting around for a party that would start later. One pointed to a man sleeping on a bench and said, “It’s his birthday.”

The used car markets are only the biggest and most visible of the many unlicensed industries that flourish here. On Saturday morning, men rode up and down Pacific Boulevard on bicycles, selling watermelon, papaya and cucumber out of plastic containers. At night, the street becomes a hub of prostitution, local business owners said.

Local governments have tried to combat these weekend car dealerships for more than a decade. Los Angeles briefly banned parking with a “For Sale” sign anywhere in the city. But in 2006, the ordinance was struck down in court on First Amendment grounds, and since then underground car markets in Southern California have continued to grow.

County and Los Angeles city officials say the new laws, which single out only certain streets, are narrow enough to stand up to a legal challenge this time.

But not all of the people selling cars here are underground dealers. Gelacio Chacon, 20, took his car to Walnut Park because he knew people came to Pacific Boulevard to buy cars. He put a “For Sale” sign up in the window and sat nearby, waiting for someone to call.

The new law, which would prevent anyone from parking on the street with a “For Sale” sign, would affect people like Mr. Chacon trying to sell their own cars, as well as the underground dealers. On the first offense, a car with a “For Sale” sign would be ticketed; the second time, it would be impounded.

Peter Eliasberg, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which brought the lawsuit against the citywide ban in Los Angeles, remained skeptical about the new laws.

“There are huge problems with these ordinances,” Mr. Eliasberg said. “There are other ways you can target the problem if people are really using these streets as outdoor malls for cars. Someone who lives in the neighborhood should be able to park there with a sign up.”
121 2011-07-05 As with other genetically influenced diseases, psoriasis tends to run in families. If both parents have it, their children have about a 40 percent chance of also developing it; the risk drops to 14 percent if only one parent is affected.

The disorder involves an abnormally rapid growth of skin cells. Normally, skin cells mature and are shed in an ongoing cycle of 28 to 30 days. In psoriasis, these cells mature in just three or four days and accumulate to form thickened patches of skin.

Recent evidence suggests that T-cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the body’s immune defenses, overreact in the presence of certain environmental factors, speeding the production of skin cells. Among common triggers are stressful events, injury to the skin, a strep throat and certain medications, including lithium, antimalarial drugs, some beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), overuse of corticosteroids and even nicotine patches.

Certain lifestyle factors are also often involved in the onset of psoriasis or its flare-ups: smoking, heavy alcohol use and a sedentary lifestyle, especially if it results in weight gain.

Winter, with its cold, dry air, is especially challenging because it robs the skin of needed moisture and thick clothing blocks exposure to the sun. Ultraviolet light, particularly UVB, penetrates the skin and helps slow the overproduction of skin cells.

Some people affected by the disease believe dietary factors are involved, and everything from sugar to coffee to eggs has been blamed. No such link has been demonstrated in rigorous studies. Still, if in individual cases a certain food is suspected as a trigger, dermatologists suggest that it be eliminated temporarily to see if the effect is real.

Beyond a possible benefit from fish oil, be wary of claims that certain alternative food products or supplements are helpful.

There are five major types of psoriasis, the most common of which is plaque psoriasis (medically called psoriasis vulgaris), which accounts for 80 percent of the cases. Red, raised, inflamed patches covered with a silvery white scale can affect skin anywhere on the body, though most often the knees, elbows, lower back and scalp.

Next most common, occurring in 10 percent of cases, is guttate psoriasis. It causes small red spots, usually on the trunk and limbs. An acute illness, like strep throat, is a common trigger, resulting in a sudden appearance of psoriasis. My husband had this type, but for much of his life was mistakenly thought to have a penicillin allergy, as the lesions appeared after he was treated with the antibiotic for strep throat.

The remaining 10 percent of cases are divided among three types: inverse psoriasis, which produces smooth, shiny red patches in skin folds; pustular psoriasis, causing red patches with tiny blisters, often limited to the hands and feet; and erythrodermic psoriasis, rare but most devastating because it produces burnlike lesions over most of the body. Flare-ups of this last type may be life-threatening, causing a rapid heart rate and disruptions in body temperature that require immediate medical attention.

Psoriasis, in the form of a debilitating condition called psoriatic arthritis, can also affect the joints. A warning sign may involve changes in the nails of the fingers or toes: a pulling away from the nail bed, pitting, ridges or a yellow-orange discoloration.

Keeping the skin well moisturized helps to control the dryness and cracking common to psoriasis. To lock in moisture, take regular but short showers with warm (not hot) water; use a fragrance-free moisturizing cleanser: and pat (do not rub) the skin dry. Follow immediately with application of a moisturizing lotion during the day or a heavier cream or ointment at night.

Do not scratch if itching is intense. Apply a cold compress, a menthol-based ointment or topical steroid, or soak in an oatmeal bath. Wear nonirritating clothing that “breathes,” like pure cotton. Overheating can intensify the itch.

Be patient. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for individual cases is often a matter of trial and error. Steroid-based topical medications, applied in very thin layers, are effective in most cases. There are many such drugs, and if one does not help, it pays to try others until one is found to reduce symptoms.

In more severe cases, an oral or injected medication may be required. In a report in 2009 in The New England Journal of Medicine, three dermatologists noted that “biologic therapies in psoriasis are highly effective.” The agents in question take aim at the T-cells or cytokines, both immune system cells involved in inflammation. These treatments are costly, however, and their long-term safety has not yet been established.

There is also increasing evidence that psoriasis is more than skin deep. People with moderate to severe psoriasis may also be at risk for other disorders involving chronic inflammation, including Crohn’s disease, diabetes and heart disease — in particular, an increased risk of heart attack. Depression is also more common in people with psoriasis, although whether it is a cause or an effect of the disease has not been established.
122 2011-07-05 On Day 3, the Tour rolled mostly north for 123 miles along the Atlantic coast of France, from the beach resort of Olonne-sur-Mer in the Vendée region to Redon in Brittany, through countryside so flat that church steeples and hay bales were often the only topographical features of note. Such terrain, with few climbs to separate the riders, favors sprinters like Farrar and Hushovd.

Hushovd, a Norwegian, maintained the yellow jersey with a sixth-place finish in Stage 3. He is a split second ahead of his teammate David Millar of Britain. But the close finish Monday may have little effect on the final outcome. One of the overall favorites, Cadel Evans of BMC Racing, gained three seconds on the defending champion, Alberto Contador, and the runner-up last year, Andy Schleck of Leopard Trek. Evans is in third place over all, and Contador, of the Saxo Bank Sungard team, is well off the pace. But Contador did manage to avoid mishaps like those that occurred in the opening stage Saturday, when he was held up by a crash in front of him.

For much of the afternoon Monday, the stage was led by a breakaway group of five relatively undecorated riders: Maxime Bouet of the AG2R-La Mondiale team, Mickael Delage of FDJ, Jose Iván Gutiérrez of Movistar, Rubén Pérez Moreno of Euskaltel Euskadi and Niki Terpstra of Quick Step. The five made their attack in the opening minutes and eventually built a cushion of more than seven minutes.

Delage won an intermediate sprint in the village of Saint-Hilaire-de-Chaléons, the only one of this or any other stage in the 2011 Tour. A change in the rules eliminated the multiple intermediate sprints of years past; this year, points toward the green jersey, given to the points leader, are awarded only during the single intrastage sprint and the sprints to the finish.

The change was expected to favor riders like Mark Cavendish, a Briton with the HTC-Highroad team who has never worn the green jersey into the Tour finish in Paris despite winning 15 stages in four previous Tours. Under the new system, the lone intermediate sprint is worth more points toward the green jersey. But Cavendish won neither the intermediate sprint nor the dash to the finish, ending up fifth.

The only significant rise in Stage 3 was a 217-foot climb up a bridge over the Loire Estuary near the port of Saint-Nazaire. The climb, rated Category 4 and worth a point toward the King of the Mountains’ polka-dot jersey, was also won by Delage. But that result will have little effect on the overall climbers’ competition, as a single top-category climb in a mountain stage is worth 20 points to the winner. After the Saint-Nazaire climb winded the five breakaway riders, the peloton, better protected from the swirling wind of the Estuary, steadily closed the gap, setting up the mass sprint to the finish.

In the final miles, Cavendish and his HTC-Highroad teammates appeared to be well positioned. But in the closing seconds, they were passed by several riders, including Farrar and Romain Feillu of Vacansoleil-DCM, who finished second.

On Tuesday, for Stage 4, the Tour remains in Brittany for a 107-mile route that begins in Lorient and ends with a Category 3 climb to the finish at Mur-de-Bretagne.
123 2011-07-05 BEIJING — A businessman on the board of a company with ties to the Red Cross Society of China has resigned after a nationwide scandal centered on his girlfriend raised questions about corruption in that and other state-run charities, according to an Internet post on Monday by a colleague of the businessman.

The businessman, Wang Jun, left the China Red Cross Bo’ai Asset Management Ltd. Corp., a for-profit company, days after Chinese Internet users accused his girlfriend, Guo Meimei, 20, of using charity money to finance a lavish lifestyle, including purchases of a Maserati, a Lamborghini and Hermès handbags.

The scandal started on June 21, when questions were raised about photographs flaunting her lifestyle that Ms. Guo had uploaded to her microblog, where she also identified her job as “commercial general manager” at the Red Cross.

The scrutiny prompted widespread condemnation and a police investigation of Ms. Guo. Chinese netizens spent days trying to figure out how she had amassed her wealth.

On Monday, the chief executive of the Bo’ai Asset Management company, Weng Tao, said on his microblog that Ms. Guo was not a manager at Bo’ai or at the Red Cross, and that her luxury items had been gifts from Mr. Wang. He said that Mr. Wang had resigned on June 26. Mr. Weng said he did not initially know of Mr. Wang’s relationship with Ms. Guo, which apparently began this winter.

The company is tied to the Red Cross of the Commercial Sector, itself a shadowy group that is linked to the Red Cross Society of China, a large government organization that is the biggest charity in the country and is a member of the International Federation of Red Cross Societies.
124 2011-07-05 A Canadian zinc mining company and a Canadian nonprofit devoted to getting vitamins and minerals to children in poor countries recently joined forces to create a new partnership, the Zinc Alliance for Child Health.

Zinc, the metal used to line the bars of traditional Paris bistros, is a mineral crucial in trace amounts to children’s growth, brain development and immune system functions. It is found in red meat, beans and peanuts, but many malnourished children eat almost nothing but cornmeal, cassava or other starches.

Teck Resources, a mining company with headquarters in Vancouver, announced that it would give $5.2 million to help six million children in Senegal get zinc supplements. Its partners in the new alliance are the Micronutrient Initiative, a nonprofit group based in Ottawa, and the Canadian International Development Agency, through which Canada channels foreign aid.

A 2006 World Health Organization review of nutrition studies concluded that zinc supplements help save the lives of children with severe diarrhea when given in conjunction with oral rehydration solution. Zinc also helped save severely underweight children.

It was less clear whether children benefited from getting routine zinc supplements, , but many poor children suffer from intestinal illnesses that make it hard to absorb the mineral. The W.H.O. said more study was needed into the best forms to offer supplements.

“The challenge the world faces is not producing more zinc,” said Don Lindsay, president of Teck Resources, pictured above. “It’s getting zinc into the diets of people suffering from zinc deficiency.”
125 2011-07-05 SHANGHAI — A year and a half after Google pulled its popular search engine out of mainland China, partly over concerns about censorship, its rival Microsoft has struck a deal with the biggest Chinese search engine, Baidu.com, to offer Web search services in English.

Baidu, previously primarily a Chinese-language search engine, made the announcement Monday afternoon, saying Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, was expected to appear on Baidu’s Web pages by the end of this year.

Baidu, which dominates Chinese-language search services here with about 83 percent of the market, has been trying for years to improve its English-language search services because English searches on its site are as many as 10 million a day, the company said. Now it has a powerful partner.

“More and more people here are searching for English terms,” Kaiser Kuo, the company’s spokesman, said Monday. “But Baidu hasn’t done a good job. So here’s a way for us to do it.”

Baidu and Microsoft did not disclose terms of the agreement. But the new English-language search results will undoubtedly be censored, since Beijing maintains strict controls over Internet companies and requires those operating on the mainland to censor results the government deems dangerous or troublesome, including references to human rights issues and dissidents.

141 2011-07-06 Instead, many of the officially nonpartisan groups in Washington are even less fiscally responsible than the partisans. Public sector labor unions have fought changes to pensions and work rules that could lead to less expensive, more effective government. Private sector unions — along with the roundtable — have defended the huge tax subsidy for health insurance, which drives up health costs.

Labor groups have at least been willing to push for some tax increases. Today’s business groups struggle to come up with any specific deficit plan. Last year, the Business Council — a group of top corporate executives headed by of — and the roundtable released a 49-page plan that simultaneously warned that projected deficits would “retard future growth” and called for policies that would add hundreds of billions of dollars a year to the deficit. That’s the essence of roundtable syndrome.

When I ask roundtable officials and other lobbyists about this contradiction, they show an impressive ability to avoid specifics and stick to their talking points. Mr. Engler, by e-mail, said, “A simpler, flatter tax system can be enacted in a fiscally responsible manner that better serves American workers and supports economic growth.”

Taken by itself, this statement is entirely accurate. The corporate tax code is a mess. A better code, say both conservative and liberal economists, would be flatter — that is, have a lower rate and fewer loopholes. Companies would then waste less time complying with the code and could still help reduce the deficit.

But the roundtable is not pushing for the simpler, flatter, fiscally responsible code that Mr. Engler mentions. It’s pushing for tax cuts for its members: a lower rate, the continuation of existing loopholes and the creation of new ones, like a permanent for research and a tax holiday for overseas profits. Mr. Engler and his colleagues, in other words, are lobbying for a more complex, less fiscally responsible tax code.

Given how much we’re going to talk about the deficit, I’d suggest requiring any self-proclaimed fiscal conservative to give specifics. You’re against the deficit? Great. How do you want to cut it?

The fact is, naming specific ways to reduce the deficit is no more technically challenging than naming new spending programs or tax cuts. To take the current negotiations as a benchmark, White House officials and Congressional leaders are looking for about $200 billion a year in deficit reduction. They could get it any number of ways.

Two different bipartisan groups — the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission and the Sustainable Defense Task Force — have called for roughly $100 billion a year in cuts to the military budget. Getting rid of farm subsidies would save about $15 billion. So would cutting the federal work force by 10 percent.

Allowing the expiration of the Bush tax cuts on income above $250,000 a year would raise about $60 billion a year. The expiration of all the other Bush tax cuts would bring in another $200 billion or so. Various changes to and — raising the age, reducing benefits for the affluent, cutting back on some forms of health care — could cut spending even more. In the long term, with projected deficits well above $1 trillion a year, such changes will surely be necessary.

By the standard of specificity, a few of the most prominent politicians in the deficit debate end up looking more serious than many outside groups. Representative , the Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, has called for the effective elimination of Medicare for everyone under 55 years old. Mr. Obama favors some Medicare cuts, the closing of several modest tax loopholes and tax increases on the affluent.

There are many potential objections to the Obama plan and to the Ryan plan. And neither would eliminate the deficit. But both plans would at least reduce it, which is more than you can say about corporate America’s deficit plan.

The deficit is one of those national challenges that will require tough choices and courageous leadership. Many of those choices and much of that leadership will have to come from politicians. But I’m guessing we won’t solve the deficit until the politicians get some help — and simply calling yourself a fiscal conservative doesn’t count as help.
142 2011-07-06 An Israeli missile strike killed two Palestinians and wounded a third in central Gaza on Tuesday, according to a medical spokesman for the Hamas-led government there. The Israeli military said the victims had been preparing to fire a rocket at Israel and were believed to be members of an Islamic extremist group. Hamas and Israel have largely adhered to an unofficial cease-fire since the spring, but the Israeli military said three rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli territory this week.
143 2011-07-06 Outside his office, protesters camp out in Syntagma Square, many criticizing the tough policies that will result in 120,000 public sector workers losing their jobs in the next three years.

Mr. Venizelos acknowledges the deep strains that austerity has brought to Greece, but he argues that in spite of the rising anger there is little appetite for new elections and a change of government.

“Yes, we have protesters on the streets, but according to the polls, the big majority of popular opinion reject the idea of early elections,” he said.

In the eyes of many, though, the Greek government’s task is a fruitless one. Greece must raise 172 billion euros by 2014 — of which 85.6 billion euros will go to paying off bondholders.

In Berlin on Wednesday, Mr. Venizelos will make the case to his European partners that via an aggressive privatization program and other reforms — like opening up closed professions as varied as truck drivers, lawyers, beekeepers and lifeguards — Greece can return to growth in 2012.

Mr. Venizelos also has the tall order of carrying out the measures. “I have no problem about the implementation,” he said. “The problem is the financial stabilization and also the behavior of the different international factors, because we have some asymmetric threats,” he added, referring to the ratings agencies that are watching his government’s every move and every figure in its balance sheets.

Unlike his predecessor, George Papaconstantinou, who was made environment and energy minister in a cabinet shake-up last month, Mr. Venizelos has the role of deputy prime minister, which allows him to convene cabinet meetings at his request.

But the program, which relies heavily on increasing value-added taxes and the levies that Greeks will have to pay on their houses and private boats, in addition to cuts in pensions and public sector wages, remains deeply unpopular in Greece — and the political tension is growing.

Last week, the center-right New Democracy opposition party, which was in power when Greece went off the debt cliff, voted down the austerity measures, saying they offer too many tax increases and not enough stimulus, although the party says it supports the privatization plan and spending cuts.

Instead, the opposition is proposing tax cuts in order to increase growth and incentives to cut down on tax evasion — hoping that Greece’s foreign lenders will come around to the idea that raising taxes in a recession will curb growth.

“It’s not two competing programs. One will fail in the next few months,” Chrysanthos Lazarides, an economic adviser to the opposition leader Antonis Samaras, said in an interview at the New Democracy party headquarters on Tuesday.

“No economist in the solar system, earth or universe” would agree with raising taxes in a recession, Mr. Lazarides added, comparing it to “squeezing money out of a dry system.”

But the supply-side economics have run up against the complex politics of Greece’s negotiations with the so-called troika, the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank.

When Mr. Samaras took his plan to Brussels last month, European leaders roundly condemned him as recklessly playing politics with Greece’s future for his own party’s political gain.

So before Mr. Venizelos’s important meeting with Germany, he took care to strike a diplomatic tone.

“I appreciate very much the positive position of the German government and personally of Minister Schäuble on this issue,” he said. “We need a new memorandum, not only a memorandum for financial support and construction but also for growth and development.”

On the controversial subject of how much the private banks should contribute to the new package, Mr. Venizelos emphasized how important it was not to give the market the impression that banks were being forced into a deal.

Ratings agencies have threatened to label this as a selective default, which might then force the European Central Bank to reject Greek bonds as collateral for the liquidity they have been providing to Greece’s weakened banks.

“The precondition is the avoidance of selective default, this is something very important for us. Because we need something real and substantial, something safe, and something not very expensive,” he said with a chuckle.

For its part, the government says it does not have the luxury of cutting taxes. “If you reduce taxes this year, we will have a huge deficit,” said George Zanias, a top economic adviser to the Finance Ministry, as he left a late-night meeting with Mr. Venizelos.

“If you wait for taxes to work through the system, you’ll have huge deficits and the markets will be closed,” he added. “Who will pay for that?”
144 2011-07-06 Prosecutors were not expected to decide on Wednesday whether to dismiss the case or offer a plea as they continue to gather more evidence, according to a senior law enforcement official.

Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested and charged in May with trying to a housekeeper at the Sofitel New York and forcing her to perform oral sex.

Prosecutors last week called into question the housekeeper’s credibility after learning that, among other things, the woman, a Guinean immigrant, had lied on her asylum application and returns, and after she admitted altering her account of what she had done after encountering Mr. Strauss-Kahn. But prosecutors maintained that there was still evidence to suggest a sexual assault had taken place.

The question remains whether that evidence is strong enough for prosecutors to get Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was once a leading candidate to become the next president of , to plead guilty to some charge. It is possible that any deal would involve a misdemeanor plea in which he would serve no jail time and would be allowed to return to France. But it remains unclear if prosecutors have ruled out seeking a felony plea.

Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s defense team gave indications last week that he would be unwilling to plead guilty to any crime unless prosecutors presented strong evidence. Barring that, the Manhattan district attorney’s office would have to dismiss the charges altogether or go to trial.

The prosecution must also consider whether it believes the case is strong enough to proceed to trial if Mr. Strauss-Kahn refuses to plead guilty.

Erin M. Duggan, the chief spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, said on Wednesday that “the investigative process is continuing, and no decisions have been made.”

Mr. Vance, in interviews last week, reiterated his position that his office was taking the appropriate steps in a difficult case, given the evidence it had. Though some have suggested that his office moved too swiftly to indict Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the district attorney, who is in his second year on the job, got a ringing endorsement Tuesday on his handling of the case.

Mayor , at a news conference in on Tuesday, praised Mr. Vance, saying he was “turning out to be a very good district attorney.”

“He’s taking on high-profile cases, and he’s facing them,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “And he probably made the right decision. Because if the allegations were true, are true, he had a legitimate worry about somebody fleeing this country, and we’d never get them back.”

Mr. Strauss-Kahn was taken off a plane bound for France when he was arrested at .

But Mr. Bloomberg said something that might be looked at favorably by Mr. Strauss-Kahn and the French: that he was opposed to “perp walks,” the act of parading people accused of crimes before news cameras.

“I’ve always thought that the perp walks were outrageous, but that’s only my view,” he said. “Nobody’s asked me, and I have no say in it.”

In other developments on Tuesday, the housekeeper filed a libel lawsuit against The New York Post in State Supreme Court in the for articles in which the paper called her a prostitute.

The lawsuit, which asks for an unspecified amount of money, cites various front-page headlines, like “DSK Maid a Hooker,” “DSK ‘Refused to Pay’ Hooker Maid for Sex” and “She Saw Johns While in DA Protection!”

The stories were false, the lawsuit says, arguing that the woman has been subjected to “ridicule throughout the world.”

A spokeswoman for The Post, Suzi Halpin, said, “We stand by our reporting,” and declined to comment further.

Asked if the housekeeper had engaged in prostitution, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, the lead prosecutor on the Strauss-Kahn case, said in an interview on Sunday, “I do not have one scintilla of information in that regard.”
145 2011-07-06 How far will Republican lawmakers go to protect millionaires? Those who think a default on the federal government’s credit seems implausible should take a sobering look at the “closed” signs dotting Minnesota. The Republican Party there readily shut down the state’s government on Friday by refusing to raise taxes on the 7,700 Minnesotans who make more than $1 million a year.

Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, campaigned for office last year promising to raise taxes on high earners, so it was no surprise when he proposed a tax increase on families making more than $150,000 a year to help close a $5 billion budget gap. In negotiations with the Republican majority in the Legislature, he compromised and reduced the increase to those making $1 million or more, but Republicans are refusing to consider any income tax increase.

Like Republicans in Washington, they have the delusion that they can balance the budget entirely from cuts.

The governor proposed more than $2 billion in cuts but refused to slash billions more from education, health care and public safety programs. The Legislature also wanted new abortion restrictions and a voter ID law that Mr. Dayton had already vetoed. When he said no, lawmakers allowed the fiscal year to end without a budget, and state government officially shut on July 1.

More than 40 state agencies have closed, including the state parks over the July Fourth holiday. Courts and public safety agencies are operating, but essential services for the poor, like food pantries and child care subsidies, have evaporated. Many parents say they may have to quit their jobs if state-subsidized child care does not resume quickly. The shutdown will cost the state money, since many of the 22,000 laid-off workers will receive unemployment benefits and health insurance, while the treasury is unable to collect on tax audits, lottery tickets and park fees.

As painful as the closure may become, the governor is right not to yield to the extremist ideology the Republicans are pursuing in St. Paul, Washington and across the country. President Obama has done so twice and faces an emboldened opposition willing to create chaos in the credit markets rather than agree to modest revenue increases from the richest people. On Tuesday, he urged everyone to leave ultimatums at the door in this week’s talks, but the Republican Party has shown no willingness to do so.
146 2011-07-06 Gov. Pat Quinn says he is ready to go to court over canceling raises for nearly 30,000 state workers. On Tuesday, Mr. Quinn, a Democrat, defended his decision to deny the raises by blaming the General Assembly for not appropriating needed money for the raises, which are required under union contracts. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees rejects the claim that the tight budget allows the governor to skip the raises and says it will go to court to get them.
147 2011-07-06 The Los Angeles Dodgers demanded on Tuesday that Major League Baseball turn over documents the team believes will show that baseball’s “abusive” treatment of the team led to its filing for bankruptcy.

M.L.B.’s actions reflected its “scheme to force a liquidity crisis” for the Dodgers, the filing said.

Team lawyers said in a motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware that M.L.B. had refused to turn over many of the documents they asked for last weekend. The team said the evidence it was seeking would demonstrate M.L.B.’s “bad faith” dealings in denying it the cash it needed to avoid bankruptcy.

It said the evidence would also show that baseball’s top executives, including Commissioner Bud Selig, had “treated the Dodgers more severely than other baseball teams in comparable circumstances.”

The Dodgers are demanding documents that relate to:

¶ Selig’s rejection of a 17-year deal with Fox Sports worth at least $2.5 billion — which the Dodgers’ owner, Frank McCourt, says pushed the team into bankruptcy — and his approval of similar local TV agreements by the Seattle Mariners, the Texas Rangers, the Houston Astros and the Mets.
148 2011-07-06 SMORGASBURG, the open-air market held every Saturday in an empty lot on the Williamsburg waterfront, is like a summer rock festival for food: exciting, overwhelming, sweaty, hot. You’ll hit your limit, and then you’ll want more.

The setup is simple: more than 50 vendors selling handmade food from tidy stalls next to the East River. (Another 40 or so sell produce, kitchen gear and pantry items.) It’s orderly but informal, a fitting playland for a food-crazy generation that photographs what it eats.

You eat standing up, at one of a few tables or at one of the two parks flanking the market. There’s a frayed public lawn to one side, a manicured garden underwritten by new condos to the other: the story of Williamsburg told in three blocks. The posted maps are almost useless, so the best plan is to jump in feet-first.

Start with a sure thing like the fried anchovies ($6) at Bon Chovie, a delicate fish that tastes like the ocean; or the chorizo sandwich ($7, $10 with blistered pimentos on the side) at Bocata; or the sloppy dog ($8) at the Meat Hook, a hot dog smothered with chipped brisket and slaw. Or go to Cemita’s and start with the namesake sandwich ($9), including chipotle spread, avocado, pickled onion and carnitas, that’s too big for one person, too messy to share. Accompany it with a yuzu, lime leaf and honey lemonade ($2) from 4πr2, or fresh watermelon juice with aloe ($5) from Salud.

New Yorkers of a certain age will head directly to the cold sesame noodles ($5) at Shorty Tang & Sons, an essential dish from the days of Danceteria. The stall is operated by Casey and Gilley Tang, grandsons of the chef who is considered by some to have perfected the creamy, lightly spicy noodles in the city. The other item for sale is a spicy daikon salad ($4), fresh and peppery with a touch of sweetness. That’s it. Like many of the stalls, Shorty Tang & Sons keeps the menu short.
149 2011-07-06 In addition to Manischewitz, other companies relocating here include Pitney Bowes, Bartlett Dairy, the audiobook company Audible.com and Wakefern, ShopRite’s supplier. In the biggest corporate move yet, the Panasonic Corporation announced in April that it would move from Secaucus to a 350,000-square-foot tower to be built across from Newark Penn Station, the city’s first new office tower in two decades.

“We’re bending over backwards to make companies feel welcome, to do whatever we can to bring them here,” Mr. Booker said at the Manischewitz ribbon-cutting.

Mr. O’Neal’s $7 million renovation of Newark Screens, the city’s only movie theater, will double the number of screens to 12, add stadium seating, 3-D projectors and 25,000 additional square feet. Built in partnership with Boraie Development of New Brunswick, N.J., it is to be partly financed with state and city money. Located on Springfield Avenue in the Central Ward, the site of 1967 race riots, the boxy building is across from a bail bond shop and an Applebee’s; the lobby has worn red vinyl bench seats and faded advertisements for nachos, slushies and popcorn.

“We want to give the kids in Newark something to do,” said Mr. O’Neal, who grew up in the Central Ward. “We want to go in there and beautify Newark.”

Newark has assets like train stations, universities, a major port, an international airport, a performing arts center and the new Prudential Center arena. But it also has Mr. Booker, who may be the city’s biggest draw.

“If our experience with this administration hadn’t been very good, we probably would have put our headquarters somewhere else,” said Paul Bensabat, a co-president of Manischewitz. “There are no two ways about it.”

Despite the activity, the city has neighborhoods crippled by blight and foreclosures, high unemployment, an overall population nearly half of what it was at its height and a punishingly high crime rate.

“The real devil in the formula has been the foreclosures. We’re seeing foreclosures on blocks that we’d made whole,” said Ray Ocasio, the executive director of La Casa de Don Pedro, a Newark-based community development organization, adding that much of the city’s emphasis has been on high-end developments rather than neighborhood revitalization projects.

Newark has to entice businesses to put shovels in the ground when the cost of construction is as high as in Manhattan, but the rents are substantially lower. The city’s office vacancy rate is 15.9 percent, and space rents for less than $24 a square foot, compared with about $58 a square foot in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

To bring in new construction, Mr. Booker has turned to state subsidies. Of the 25 projects in development this year, 20 of them received public financing. The biggest winner was Panasonic, which received a $102.4 million tax credit from the state for building near a transit hub. Of the $822 million in state tax credits doled out in the last 18 months, $208 million has gone to Newark, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a research group.

“We would never have been able to advocate successfully without these measures,” said Stefan Pryor, the city’s deputy mayor for economic development. “The legacy of these temporary measures will be permanent. Newark will permanently be on a new trajectory.”

Critics worry that the subsidies have failed to deliver jobs, the intended purpose of the stimulus program. Newark, the state’s largest city, has an unemployment rate of 15.4 percent, compared with 9.4 percent for New Jersey as a whole. Of the 2,500 permanent jobs the developments will bring to Newark, only about half of them are new. The rest, like the 800 Panasonic jobs, are pre-existing positions. And of the new jobs, like the 60 at Marriott, many are relatively low-paying service work.

“Building hotels so people want to stay overnight in Newark? I’m not sure that’s the best way to build Newark’s economy. I think it’s a spotty plan,” said Deborah Howlett, the president of New Jersey Policy Perspective.

Certainly, many of the changes are visible. A streetscape project along Broad Street has added a median and flowers to what was a chaotic, treacherous crossing. Around the corner from the 150-room Marriott, asbestos abatement has begun for the renovation of a Cass Gilbert building that will reemerge next year as an Indigo hotel with a rooftop bar. And work is under way for a new Dinosaur Bar-B-Que restaurant to open onto Championship Plaza next to the arena.

“I call it selective improvement,” said Marc E. Berson, the chairman of the Fidelco Group, which is building Dinosaur Bar-B-que with the Hanini Group. “I can turn and say there are different segments that are doing fairly well. As I march around I see signals of change.”
150 2011-07-06 Tiger Woods announced Tuesday on his Web site that he would not play in the British Open next week at Royal St. George’s in Sandwich, England.

Woods, 35, who will miss his second straight major championship because of injuries to his left leg, said he was following the advice of his doctors.

“Unfortunately, I’ve been advised that I should not play in the British Open,” he said. “As I stated at the AT&T National, I am only going to come back when I’m 100 percent ready. I do not want to risk further injury. That’s different for me, but I’m being smarter this time. I’m very disappointed and want to express my regrets to the British Open fans.”

Woods explained his decision to Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, the sport’s ruling body in much of the world.

“I know how disappointed Tiger is not to be able to play in the Open this year,” Dawson said on the Royal and Ancient’s Web site. “Naturally, we are sorry that a player of his caliber isn’t able to join us at Royal St. George’s, but we wish him well in his recovery and hope to see him back soon, competing in front of the fans that love to see him play the game.”
151 2011-07-06 Late Tuesday, The Guardian reported that the police would review every highly publicized murder, kidnapping or assault involving a child since 2001 for evidence of phone hacking. That would include the notorious case of , the 3-year-old who disappeared while her family was on vacation in in 2007.

In another development, Channel 4 reported on Tuesday that Ms. Brooks met with the police in 2002 over accusations that the tabloid had placed a senior Metropolitan police detective under surveillance.

The detective was investigating the murder of a private investigator who had been found dead with an ax buried in the back of his head. The chief suspect at the time was the dead man’s business partner, a private investigator who earned a six-figure salary supplying The News of the World with confidential information. Nothing apparently came of the inquiry into The News of the World’s surveillance.

Scotland Yard detectives were also investigating whether the phones of some families of victims of the bombings of three subway trains and a double-decker bus in July 2005 had also been hacked, The Telegraph reported.

In his remarks, Mr. Cameron did not mention Ms. Brooks, but his comments were notable because, like other British politicians, he has cultivated social connections with News Corporation executives like Ms. Brooks and , the chief executive of the company. Mr. Cameron, along with , the Labour prime minister at the time, was a guest at the reception following Ms. Brooks’s marriage to her second husband, Charlie Brooks, in 2009.

Ms. Brooks vowed to “pursue the facts with vigor and integrity,” saying she had no intention of quitting.

“I am aware of the speculation about my position,” she said in a memo to News International employees. “Therefore it is important you all know that as chief executive, I am determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues.”

The allegations center on one of the most sensational Fleet Street stories of the last decade, the disappearance of Milly Dowler in 2002. The case was the subject of many tabloid front pages over the last decade, culminating last month in the conviction of Levi Bellfield, a former nightclub doorman, on charges of kidnapping and murder.

The allegation that investigators working for The News of the World may have had ordinary people like the Dowlers, not just celebrities, in their sights has raised the level of alarm in Britain over tabloid newspaper excesses.

“The Milly Dowler story has taken this from an issue for people who are concerned about media ethics to one that is of broader concern to the general public,” said Tim Luckhurst, a journalism professor at the University of Kent. “News Corporation thought they could put a lid on this, and this has blown the lid right off.”

According to Mark Lewis, a lawyer for the Dowler family, The News of the World not only intercepted messages left on Milly Dowler’s phone by her increasingly frantic family, but also deleted some of those messages when her voice mailbox became full — thus making room for new ones and listening to those in turn. This confused investigators and gave false hope to Milly’s relatives, who believed it showed she was still alive and deleting the messages herself, Mr. Lewis said.

In a statement, Mr. Lewis called the newspaper’s actions “heinous” and “despicable,” and said the Dowler family had suffered “distress heaped upon tragedy” upon learning that The News of the World “had no humanity at such a terrible time.”

Public revulsion over the affair has been so intense that a private investigator at the center of the phone hacking, Glenn Mulcaire, felt compelled to provide a statement to The Guardian on Tuesday evening, his first public comment in the five years since the scandal broke. In it he apologized “to anybody who was hurt or upset,” and said he was speaking out because of the “vilification” he and his family had been subjected to in the past 24 hours.

Mr. Mulcaire, who worked for The News of the World and served prison time for his role in hacking the phones of members of the royal family, blamed “relentless pressure” at the paper for his mistakes, saying “there was a constant demand for results.”

He added: “I knew what we did pushed the limits ethically. But, at the time, I didn’t understand that I had broken the law at all. A lot of information I obtained was simply tittle-tattle, of no great importance to anyone, but sometimes what I did was for what I thought was the greater good, to carry out investigative journalism.”

If Mr. Lewis’s accusations about hacking during the Dowler case prove accurate, it would mean either that Ms. Brooks had no idea how the paper she edited was obtaining information about the Dowler family for its articles, or that she knew about the hacking and allowed it.

Ms. Brooks, in her memo, did not deny the allegations, but said she had had no knowledge of phone hacking on her watch. “I hope that you all realize it is inconceivable that I knew or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations,” she said.

The scandal has already claimed the job of one former high-ranking News Corporation official, , who was Ms. Brooks’s deputy at The News of the World in 2002 and who later moved into the top editor’s role.

The allegations in the Dowler case appeared as the British government weighs an important business matter affecting News Corporation: its proposed acquisition of British Sky Broadcasting, a pay-TV company in which it is already the largest shareholder. Government officials have indicated that they intend to approve the plan, and say the Dowler case allegations should have no bearing on the matter.

“It really doesn’t have anything to do with the hacking inquiry,” Vince Cable, the business secretary, said on television.

There has long been speculation that other British papers may have engaged in similar tactics. So widespread was the practice that even Ms. Brooks, in a surprising twist, is apparently among the victims of phone hacking.

News International said last month that Ms. Brooks had been informed by the police that her voice mail messages had been intercepted by Mr. Mulcaire.

The hacking apparently took place around 2005, when Ms. Brooks was editor of another News Corporation tabloid, The Sun, and when there was considerable interest in her personal life. In November 2005, she was detained by the police in a domestic dispute with a British actor named Ross Kemp, her husband at the time. Ms. Brooks, then known under her maiden name, Rebekah Wade, was not charged, and the two later divorced.

159 2011-07-07 It requires no great critical insight to figure out what’s wrong with “Horrible Bosses,” a foul-mouthed new comedy of male resentment directed by Seth Gordon. The problems can be enumerated with a prim scowl and a wagging finger. The movie, in addition to being expectedly vulgar, is noisy and preposterous, and its humor flirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia. There are guns, drugs, several references to sex acts involving urine, and gross insults — unless they are extravagant compliments; I’ll get back to you — to the respected profession of dentistry.

So here is the evident puzzle: “Horrible Bosses” is also frequently very funny. One reason is that it does not bother to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability. Nor, however, does it make a big show of being provocative, of pretending that its forays into offensiveness are acts of bravery. It takes the ordinary human traits of stupidity, selfishness, lust and greed (and also stupidity), embeds them in a human condition that is confusing, unfair and also stupid, and turns the whole sorry spectacle into a carnival. The laughter is mean but also oddly pure: it expels shame and leaves you feeling dizzy, a little embarrassed and also exhilarated, kind of like the cocaine that two of the main characters consume by accident.

The scene of their hapless nose-candy binge exemplifies this movie’s spirit. On the one hand, the guys — Dale (Charlie Day) and Nick (Jason Bateman), along with their friend Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) — have broken into a house to do a little recon for one of three murders they plan to commit. This is a bad thing to do. On the other hand, there is something endearing about their utter hysterical ineptness, and their excursion into vice and criminality seems as innocent as it is desperate.

The desperation allows “Horrible Bosses” to graze ever so lightly against some unpleasant social realities and to find a glimmer of class consciousness in an avalanche of crude gaggery. Dale, Nick and Kurt are all stuck in terrible jobs, at the mercy of employers whose power is absolute and arbitrary. “I own you,” says Mr. Harken, Nick’s smug, sadistic boss, played by — one guess! — Kevin Spacey with all the lethal smarm he brought to “Swimming With Sharks” and more. Sure, it’s an easy bit of casting, but so is Colin Farrell as a twitchy, amoral playboy and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy dentist.

I mean a sexually predatory dentist, though the distinction is lost on Kurt, who thinks she’s hot. But he doesn’t work for her. Dale does, and her constant barrage of innuendo and solicitation — she’s as subtle as a plumber making a house call in a porn film — makes him uncomfortable. The sheer tastelessness of this situation is what makes it work, coupled with its almost surreal improbability. Dale, in addition to being a devoted almost-husband (his briefly glimpsed fiancée is played by Lindsay Sloane) is a ball of rodentlike, idiotic nervous energy.

172 2011-07-07 Four former workers at a testing laboratory have been indicted on felony animal cruelty charges, after an animal rights group’s undercover investigation that captured video images of animals being hit, kicked and thrown, officials said Wednesday. District Attorney Frank Parrish of Gates County said that Christine Clement and Tracy Small were indicted on two counts each of cruelty to animals, while Jessica Detty and Mary Ramsey were each indicted on five counts of the same charge. The charges follow the September 2010 release of a videotape provided by an undercover worker for the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Kathy Guillermo, an investigator for the group, said it was the first case she was aware of in which research lab workers had been charged with animal cruelty. Professional Laboratory and Research Services Inc. was closed in late 2010 after the Department of Agriculture received PETA’s report. It was not affiliated with any specific company but would carry out testing for manufacturers of pet products, like flea and tick medications.
173 2011-07-07 Roles in The News of the World Hacking Scandal

Former and current executives and employees of The News of the World or its parent companies.
174 2011-07-07 “I can’t guarantee this, of course, but my tendency is to try to get quick decisions,” he said during a hearing last week in which he evinced, at least for the purposes of the legal argument before him, a fair amount of sympathy toward the team’s owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz.

Indeed, near the end of the hearing, one that was consumed by debate about the merits of the trustee’s efforts to get hundreds of millions from the team’s owners, Rakoff expressed skepticism about the trustee’s approach. He suggested that in accusing the owners of being “willfully blind” to the possibility that Madoff was a fraud during their many years of investing with him, the trustee might be holding them to an unfair standard. In fact, determining that, Rakoff said, could invite even larger issues.

“There are even intimations, though not raised by the movants, of constitutional issues,” he said.

He did not say what they were, but lawyers familiar with Rakoff and his appetite for novel rulings said this week that they would not be shocked if he tried try to say something larger about the law.

The hearing last week certainly illustrated aspects of Rakoff’s style: persistent, challenging and humorous. He suggested that he nearly fell asleep reading the trustee’s 373-page lawsuit against the team’s owners, yet he allowed that he admired its “Tolstoy-like rhetoric.”

He jabbed a little at the confidence and arguments of David Sheehan, counsel to the trustee. And he seemed to vigorously question the approach being taken by the trustee, Irving H. Picard. Picard was appointed in 2009 by a federal bankruptcy judge to try and recoup as much money as possible and distribute it to deserving victims of Madoff’s colossal fraud. To date, Picard, often through the threat of aggressive lawsuits against Madoff investors he thinks either knew — or should have suspected — Madoff was involved in wrongdoing, has collected roughly $10 billion.

At the heart of the hearing — lawyers for the team’s owners had asked Rakoff to remove the case from bankruptcy court — were Rakoff’s questions about what laws should govern how culpable, if at all, the Mets’ owners should be found for investing in what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme.

Picard says bankruptcy laws apply, and those laws allow him to look at an investor’s history to see if they had doubts — or should have had doubts — about Madoff’s operation. He has accused Wilpon and Katz of ignoring numerous warnings about Madoff. As a result, he is seeking the return of $1 billion in what is known as a “clawback” action.

In strictly legal terms, the trustee says, the owners had across the years, and in the face of alarms and warnings, been put on what is known as “inquiry notice,” a standard that obligated them to look into Madoff’s legitimacy. Picard has asserted that the owners never did the slightest bit of investigating during years and years of spectacularly consistent, always profitable years of investing with Madoff.

Lawyers for the owners reject that analysis, and have accused Picard of trying to strong-arm them into a massive settlement. The lawyers argue that securities law, not bankruptcy law, applies to Wilpon and Katz. Under securities law, they argue, the men were no different than any other investors — not at all obligated to mount their own investigation of their private broker.

Interpreting how a judge might rule based on his conduct and demeanor during a hearing is, of course, risky. Judges can play the devil’s advocate. Still, Rakoff sounded like he was siding with arguments made by Karen Wagner, the Mets’ lead lawyer.

Rakoff asked, with some amazement, a question that is critical to Katz and Wilpon’s case.

How, he wondered, can investors like them not be judged by the securities laws that governed their 25 years of investing with Madoff, but by the bankruptcy laws that came into play after Madoff’s collapse.

“That’s the nature of bankruptcy law,” said Christopher LaRosa, a lawyer for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a federal agency that is working with Picard.

“I’m not sure I agree with that,” Rakoff said.

Rakoff is now awaiting more legal briefs before hearing arguments again on Aug. 17.

Rakoff, a Harvard Law graduate, served as the head of the securities frauds unit of the United States Attorney for the Southern District in New York from 1978 to 1980. He developed a reputation as a leading securities lawyer, before becoming a district court judge in 1996.

He has overseen the financial fraud case of WorldCom; two years ago, he sentenced Marc S. Dreier to 20 years in prison for bilking investors and hedge funds of $700 million; and he is an expert on the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.

And for nearly 25 years, Rakoff has taught a class on white collar crime at Columbia University with John C. Coffee Jr., a law school professor. Coffee, who said that Rakoff was more of a mainstream judge than some of his maverick rulings suggest, said that district judges and bankruptcy judges see things differently.

“In the bankruptcy court,” Coffee said, “plaintiffs can sometimes convince a bankruptcy judge that gross negligence implies willful blindness. But that is unlikely to work with Judge Rakoff.”

Rakoff can dismiss the case, or rule on some issues then return it to bankruptcy court to be tried by Judge Burton R. Lifland. It remains to be seen if Rakoff will rule on the $300 million Wilpon and Katz are accused of earning in fictitious profits — the difference between what they took out and what they put in — with another case on that subject awaiting a decision by an appeals court.

Sheehan said in an interview that his “fictitious profits” claim against the owners does not involve charging that the men turned a blind eye to warnings of the possibility of a fraud. That claim, then, might survive even an adverse ruling by Rakoff.

“A Ponzi scheme is a zero sum game,” he said. “So if you are a net winner, you perforce have someone else’s money and your state of mind should be irrelevant.”
175 2011-07-07 Controlling executives may turn down takeover bids because they enjoy the power and perks of their positions. Managers also are less likely to step down when doing poorly. Finally, executive salaries at dual-class firms tend to be higher and the framework can encourage self-dealing.

There may already be small hints of those concerns at Zynga. For instance, the firm is paying Mr. Pincus’s sister, a professor who has worked on poverty issues, $5,000 a month to act as the director of its affiliated nonprofit. And it paid $400,000 to Mr. Pincus for office space he owns.

These issues may have benign explanations and seem remote to potential Zynga investors eager to get their hands on the hottest new tech stock. They are also presumably keen to keep Mr. Pincus happy, given his role creating a potential $20 billion powerhouse. But they should be fully aware of just how big the price could be.

Investors don’t expect Williams Companies to give up the chase for rival Southern Union. But trumping the latest $5 billion offer by Energy Transfer Equity will destroy value for its own shareholders. With Southern Union starting to seem an expensive catch, Williams may be better off letting its rival overpay.

Southern Union shareholders can thank Williams. Its $4.86 billion cash bid last month broke up a cozy arrangement with Energy Transfer that lavished goodies on Southern Union executives while short-changing other investors. Still, Williams now faces a tough choice. Energy Transfer’s sweetened bid for Southern already looks like a full price. At nine times next year’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, it is in line with similar deals over the last decade, according to Barclays Capital.

Moreover, to clinch a deal, Williams faces added hurdles. Southern Union’s stock price suggests investors expect a bid of $42 a share. On top of that, Energy Transfer’s latest deal with management doubled the initial breakup fee to $212.5 million, or an extra cost to Williams of around $1.70 per Southern Union share.

Add these fees to the pipeline company’s existing debt, and a $42-a-share offer would cost Williams around $9.4 billion. Based on Southern Union’s forecast operating profit, that would bring the deal’s post-tax return on investment to below 5.5 percent. That’s lower than Williams’s 7 percent weighted average cost of capital.

And this calculation is generous, because it assumes Williams can achieve $100 million in cost cuts and revenue gains that Energy Transfer has promised. The Williams spoiler bid estimated only around $50 million of such synergies.

Furthermore, there’s no certainty a bid of $42 a share would work. Winning over Southern Union’s top managers, who own about 14 percent of the company, might be even harder. Williams’s all-cash offer would leave them paying capital gains taxes. To clinch its prey without issuing equity might require Williams to pay as much as $45 a share.

Williams’s chief executive, Alan S. Armstrong, has already done enough for Southern Union shareholders by forcing a rival to scramble to pay 20 percent more for assets it coveted. He can best serve his own investors by walking away from a costly bidding war.
176 2011-07-07 But there are growing signs that China’s long-running economic boom could be undermined by these building binges, which are financed through heavy borrowing by local governments and clever accounting that masks the true size of the debt.

The danger, experts say, is that China’s municipal governments could already be sitting on huge mountains of hidden debt — a lurking liability that threatens to stunt the nation’s economic growth for years or even decades to come. Just last week China’s national auditor, who reports to the cabinet, warned of the perils of local government borrowing. And on Tuesday the office of issued a report saying the national auditor might have understated Chinese banks’ actual risks from to local governments.

Because Chinese growth has been one of the few steady engines in the global economy in recent years, any significant slowdown in this country would have international repercussions.

As municipal projects play out across China, spending on so-called fixed-asset — a crucial measure of building that is heavily weighted toward government and real estate projects — is now equal to nearly 70 percent of the nation’s . It is a ratio that no other large nation has approached in modern times.

Even , at the peak of its building boom in the 1980s, reached only about 35 percent, and the figure has hovered around 20 percent for decades in the .

China’s high number helps explain its meteoric material rise. But it could also signal a dangerous dependence on government infrastructure spending.

“If China’s good at anything, it’s infrastructure,” said Pieter P. Bottelier, a China expert at the in . “But right now it seems the investment rate is too high. How much of that is ill-advised and future nonperforming loans, no one knows.”

For the last decade, as economists have sought to explain China’s rise, a popular image has emerged of Beijing technocrats continually and cannily fine-tuning the nation’s communist-capitalist hybrid. But in fact, city governments often work at odds with Beijing’s aims. And some of Beijing’s own goals and policies can be contradictory.

As a result, China’s state capitalism is much messier, and the economy more vulnerable, than it might look to the outside world.

In the case of Wuhan, a close look at its finances reveals that the city has borrowed tens of billions of dollars from state-run . But the loans seldom go directly to the local government. Instead, the borrowing is done by special investment corporations set up by the city — business entities whose debt shows up nowhere on Wuhan’s official financial balance sheet.

Adding to the risk, the collateral for many loans is local land valued at lofty prices that could collapse if China’s real estate bubble burst. Wuhan’s land prices have tripled in the last decade.

The biggest of the separate investment companies set up by the municipal government here is an entity known as Wuhan Urban Construction Investment and Development, created to help finance billions of dollars’ worth of projects, including roadways, bridges and sewage treatment plants.

According to city records, Wuhan U.C.I.D. has 16,000 employees, 25 subsidiaries and $15 billion in assets — including the possibly inflated value of the land itself. But it owes nearly as much, about $14 billion.

“U.C.I.D. is heavily in debt,” a company spokesman, Sun Zhengrong, conceded in an interview. “This may lead to potential problems. So we are trying to make some adjustments.” He declined to elaborate, saying the state company’s finances were “our core secret.”

Dozens of other cities are following a similarly risky script: creating off balance-sheet corporations that are going deeply into debt for showpiece projects, new subway systems, lines and extravagant government office complexes. And they are doing it despite efforts by the central government in Beijing to rein in the excess.

To limit the cities’ debt, Beijing has long prohibited municipalities from issuing to finance government projects — as American cities do as a matter of course. Lately, too, China’s central government has put tighter limits on state-owned banks’ lending to municipalities. But by using off-the-books investment companies, cities have largely eluded Beijing’s rules.

Zhang Dong, a municipal government adviser who also teaches finance at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, estimates that less than 5 percent of the city’s infrastructure spending comes from Wuhan’s general budget. “Most of it comes from off-the-books financing,” he said.

This system is not a secret from Beijing, which now says there are more than 10,000 of these local government financing entities in China. In fact, because Beijing now takes a large share of government revenue, local governments have had to find their own way to grow, and land development is primarily how they have done it.

But it is a risky game. A recent report by the investment bank predicted that local government investment corporations could generate up to $460 billion in loan defaults over the next few years. As a percentage of China’s G.D.P., that would be far bigger than the $700 billion troubled-asset bailout program in the United States.

As frightening as that may sound, many analysts see no reason for panic — no imminent threat of an economy-collapsing banking crisis in China. That is largely because of Beijing’s $3 trillion war chest of foreign exchange reserves (much of it invested in bonds), and the fact that China’s state-run banks are also sitting on huge piles of household savings from the nation’s 1.3 billion citizens.

Because all that cash is protected by government restrictions on money flowing in and out of the country, a global run on China’s banks would be unlikely.

The real problem, analysts say, is that municipal government debt in China has begun casting a large shadow over the nation’s growth picture. If instead of investing in growth, China had to start spending money to gird the banks against municipal defaults, some experts see a possibility of China eventually lapsing into a long period of Japan-like stagnation.

Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and co-author of “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” has studied China’s boom. He predicts that within a decade China’s lofty property bubble and its mounting debts could cause a regional in and stifle growth in the rest of the world.

“With China, you have the ultimate ‘this time is different’ syndrome,” Professor Rogoff said. “Economists say they have huge reserves, they have savings, they’re hard-working people. It’s naïve. You can’t beat the odds forever.”

By Beijing’s estimate, total local government debt amounted to $2.2 trillion last year — a staggering figure, equal to one-third of the nation’s gross domestic product. A wave of municipal defaults could become a huge liability for the central government, which is sitting on about $2 trillion in debt of its own.

And Beijing’s estimate of what the cities owe might be too low, in the view of Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at who has studied China’s municipal debt. He says that by now, after even more borrowing in early 2011 and some figures hidden from government audits, total municipal debt in China could be closer to $3 trillion.

“Most of the government entities that borrow can’t even make the interest payments on the loans,” Professor Shih said.

Around the clock, seven days a week, the construction crews burrow to build Wuhan’s $45 billion subway system. One segment snakes beneath the mighty Yangtze River.

“For most areas we dig down 18 to 26 meters,” said Lin Wenshu, one of the planning directors of the Wuhan Metro. “But for part of this line we’ve had to go down 50 meters because there’s high pressure and a lot of mud from the river,” he said. “But the citizens want a subway system, and so we’re going to build it as fast as possible.”

In all, city officials say there are more than 5,700 construction projects under way in Wuhan. In some neighborhoods, workers demolish old homes with little more than sledgehammers and their bare hands to make way for shopping malls, high-rise apartment complexes and new expressways.

Having seen Beijing, Shanghai and other coastal metropolises thrive on big infrastructure projects, cities thousands of miles inland, like Wuhan, are trying to do likewise. Wuhan wants to become a manufacturing and transportation hub for the heartland — China’s version of .

But it is a dream built on debt. This year, relying largely on bank loans, Wuhan plans to spend about $22 billion on infrastructure projects, an amount five times as large as the city’s tax revenue last year. And aspirations notwithstanding, Wuhan is still relatively poor. Residents here earn about $3,000 a year, only about two-thirds as much as those in Shanghai.

But Wuhan has made the most of the soaring value of its land. In the northwest part of the city, for example, bulldozers have cleared a huge tract more than twice the size of Central Park. A dozen years ago it was a military air base.

Giant billboards advertise a new purpose: future home of the Wangjiadun Central Business District, featuring office towers and luxury apartments for 200,000 people. That assumes, of course, that financing for the project — a web of loans and deals based largely on the underlying value of the land — holds up.

Planning began in 1999, when the city decided to relocate the air base. After the city ran short of cash for the project, in 2002, it turned to a deep-pocketed Beijing developer, the Oceanwide Corporation. Oceanwide agreed to chip in $275 million and pay some of the infrastructure costs in exchange for a prime piece of the land.

Since then, the city has sold large plots of the former air base to other developers, while earmarking yet other parcels for future sale to help pay for the new business district.

There is no question that China needs new infrastructure and transportation networks if it is to meet its goal of transforming most of its huge population into city dwellers. Less certain is whether the country can afford to keep building at this pace, and whether many of these projects will ever pay off in terms of the economic development they are meant to support.

Beijing helped ratchet up the municipal building boom in early 2009, when in response to the global recession, it pressed local governments to think big and announced a huge economic . That unleashed a wave of government-backed bank lending.

“What we’re seeing was not very common before 2008,” said Fu Zhihua, a research fellow at the Research Institute for Fiscal Science. “Now, all cities are rushing headlong into this.”

And now, try as it might, Beijing seems unable to stop the stampede.

Part of the problem may be incentives in China’s Politburo-driven economic system. Simply put, municipal officials in China keep their jobs and earn promotions on the basis of short-term economic growth.

“The fact is, local governments in China compete to grow G.D.P. in order to get promoted as government officials,” said Zeng Kanghua, who teaches finance at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.

Ruan Chengfa, Wuhan’s 54-year-old local Communist party secretary, who was promoted earlier this year from mayor, has certainly benefited politically from his “Mr. Digging” reputation.

He declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a speech in February, he said, “If we want Wuhan to have leapfrog development and enhance people’s happiness, then we must build subways and bridges.”

Wuhan is starting to show symptoms of financial stress.

Despite selling about $25 billion worth of land over the last five years, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm based in New York, Wuhan is struggling to pay for its projects. City officials have announced a big increase in bridge tolls. Under pressure from Beijing to reduce Wuhan’s debt, they have promised to pay back $2.3 billion to state-backed creditors this year.

Whether the city would do this by borrowing more money or selling land or assets is unclear. But rolling over old debts with new borrowing is not uncommon among Chinese cities. In 2009, for instance, Wuhan’s big investment company, Wuhan U.C.I.D., borrowed $230 million from investors and then used nearly a third of the money to repay some of its bank loans.

Mainly, Wuhan’s leaders are counting on property prices to continue defying gravity, even if some analysts predict a coming crash.

In a report this year, the investment bank identified Wuhan as one of China’s “top 10 cities to avoid,” saying its housing stock was so huge that it would take eight years to sell the residences already completed — never mind the hundreds of thousands now under construction.

But criticism has not deterred Mr. Ruan, the local party secretary, who has vowed to keep his foot on the shovel. “If we don’t speed up construction,” he said in the speech in February, “many of Wuhan’s problems won’t be solved.”
177 2011-07-07 After steadily climbing for several years, the number of Americans filing for bankruptcy is on the decline, though that is not necessarily an indicator of an improving economy.

The number of bankruptcy filings in June was 120,623, or an average of 5,483 a day, a drop of 6.2 percent from May, when filings totaled 122,775, or 5,846 a day, according to a report from Epiq Systems, which tracks bankruptcy filings. There was one additional day to file in June compared with May. Average daily filings are down nearly 10 percent from June of last year.

Though economic factors like foreclosures and unemployment play a role in bankruptcy, over the long run, the filing rate tends to be more closely tethered to the amount of outstanding consumer debt.

Access to credit, however, can influence the bankruptcy rate over the shorter term: as lenders tighten their standards, filings tend to rise because struggling consumers can no longer rely on credit cards or other loans to get them through a rough period. But when more new loans are being made, filings tend to fall — at least for a while.

“There is a lot of mythology about what drives bankruptcy rates,” said Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law who specializes in bankruptcy. “But consumer credit appears to be the most significant indicator.”

Over all, he said he expected filings to decline 5 to 10 percent this year, leveling off at about 1.46 million, largely because consumers have slightly more access to credit now than in recent years. But he also said that consumers had taken on less debt in the past three years, which means there is less debt to discharge and fewer incentives to file bankruptcy.
178 2011-07-07 Light but large, marvelously limpid, the style of classical ballet that American Ballet Theater as a company now possesses is often on the verge of greatness. And of its various full-length vehicles none currently shows the troupe so well as Kevin McKenzie’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” which has returned to repertory for this final week of the troupe’s annual eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House. True, the production, new in 2007, has always been seriously flawed; in a ballet that should evoke a peak of civilization, most of Tony Walton’s sets and a few of Willa Kim’s costume designs are all too Disney. The staging’s merits, however, have now come into their own.

On Tuesday night a series of these virtues, often in feminine form, caught the breath. When the stage was flooded by the Lilac Fairy’s attendants — 12 of them in the Prologue and 20 in the Act II Vision scene — the theater was suddenly alight with the radiance that classical ballet can offer through its demonstration of the human as ideal. In Act I the eight friends of the heroine, Princess Aurora — though they would profit from more dynamic variety and from better patterning within the stage space — also showed the same effortless clarity.

This excellence is also widespread at the soloist level. On Tuesday, Hee Seo, Isabella Boylston and Misty Copeland (dancing solos in the Prologue), and Sarah Lane (as Princess Florine in Act III) each burst onto the stage with her own distinctive fragrance, while sharing the general qualities of amplitude, line and musicality. Sometimes the merest change of position sent sparks right through the theater; sometimes a merely transitional phrase made the felicities of Tchaikovsky’s score register anew.

Veronika Part, with her handsome, broad-shouldered Joan Crawford looks, showed on Tuesday a much firmer sense of Aurora than when she danced this production four years ago. With eyelids lowered less often, she strikes a slightly different mood for each act: modestly jubilant as the young princess in Act I, sadly gracious as the Vision of Act II, expansively celebratory in Act III. But her success varied from phrase to phrase, even from step to step — balances were tense, jumps easily grand, detailed pointwork awkward, certain arabesques calmly and simply luminous — so that, between admiring this moment and worrying about the next one, it was hard to follow Aurora herself rather than her challenges.

It’s Ms. Part’s and our loss that this production, like most today, doesn’t ask Aurora to phrase several diagonals of repeated steps in Acts I and III as crescendi, or gradual accumulations of scale from small to large in terms of upper-body detail. In the past these sequences have often proved the greatest passages of the whole ballet.
179 2011-07-07 Companions in Battle: Animals of the Civil War
180 2011-07-07 Turning the epic into digestible theater was a labor of love for Mr. Kent and the actor Ian McDiarmid, who met at Citizens Theater in Glasgow in the 1970s and, from 1990 to 2002, were joint artistic directors of the Almeida Theater here. Mr. McDiarmid won a featured actor Tony Award in 2006 in “Faith Healer,” playing the orange-haired manager of Mr. Fiennes’s character. His voice is easily recognizable from the “Star Wars” movies: He played the evil emperor, a character not wholly unlike his role as a mystical guru in “Galilean.”

During an interview at the National this week the two men recalled that they first discussed adapting “Emperor and Galilean” for the Almeida in the late 1990s. Mr. Kent described the challenge of distilling Ibsen’s original, and Mr. McDiarmid picked up the thought by saying that adaptation to four hours from nine was more a matter of carving than distilling.

“We felt like a great play could be sculpted from this enormous rock of Ibsen’s,” Mr. McDiarmid said. “But the scale of the undertaking really took a theater with the resources of the National.”

After Mr. Kent directed an “Oedipus” there, the artistic director of the National, Nicholas Hytner, asked what he would like to do next. Mr. Kent mentioned the Ibsen play and was stunned to find that Mr. Hytner happened to have it on his desk. Soon Mr. Kent was working with an associate director of the National, the writer Ben Power.

Mr. Power said he ended up writing 15 different drafts of the adaptation. With each one he bore down on the plot structure, ultimately sharpening it into a quest story that involved Julian and his three childhood friends, all of whom appear in Ibsen’s work but not in Mr. Power’s strikingly modern arrangement. The three friends go from companions to sounding boards to, ultimately, antagonists of Julian, imbuing the work with a far greater emotional depth than the original.

“It’s not just the length and scale which has stopped this piece being performed until now,” Mr. Power said. “I wanted to make a version which allowed the incredibly potent and resonant ideas to emerge directly and clearly for a contemporary audience.”

The adaptation also points up psychological themes that would be more apparent in Ibsen’s later works: Julian’s experience of being smothered by the tenets of Christianity echo the subjugation of Hedda and of Nora in “A Doll’s House,” and his subsequent breakdown is especially of a piece with Hedda’s. Ideas about free will, powerlessness and destiny also play out in “An Enemy of the People” and “The Master Builder.”

Julian’s eventual obsession with establishing a “third kingdom” on earth — essentially a combination of the kingdom of man and the kingdom of God — becomes a dominant part of the National production, with an implicit nod to the rise of Nazism some 50 years after he wrote the play.

“I do think Ibsen could see the rise of a third empire in Europe like that which Julian imagined, and unfortunately, as we know, a third empire did rise, and it was called the Third Reich,” Mr. McDiarmid said. “He didn’t predict that, but if you look at this play closely, it suggests that if you’re looking for another kind of earthly empire, it would be of a fascistic nature.”

Mr. McDiarmid was good-natured about entertaining comparisons of his character in the play, Maximus, to his best-known character, the hissing Palpatine of “Star Wars.” Unlike in those movies Mr. McDiarmid is not the emperor of the Ibsen play, but rather a spiritual adviser (based on a historical figure) who takes advantage of the conflicted Julian and leads him, if not to the dark side, then to a deep embrace of paganism and a bloody suppression of Christianity. In “Star Wars” Palpatine manipulates a similarly conflicted Anakin Skywalker to embrace the dark side of the force and ultimately become Darth Vader.

At moments during a recent performance Mr. McDiarmid’s disgusted delivery of the word “Galilean” (in reference to Jesus, whom Maximus despises), carried an unmistakable echo of the way Palpatine hissed the word “Jedi.”

“I had a great time doing ‘Star Wars,’ but George Lucas would be the first to say that its target audience is 8-year-olds,” Mr. McDiarmid said. He added dryly, “I don’t think that’s the case with ‘Emperor and Galilean,’ though I’m happy to have 8-year-olds come in.”
181 2011-07-07 That ambition, if realized, would most likely occur in increments. Geographically, the seizure of Qawalish marked a minor shift in the front lines. But it moved the rebels within about 35 miles of Gharyan, a small city astride a strategic highway running south from Tripoli.

The highway heads south to Sabha, the central Libyan city that the rebels regard as a principal source of war matériel and other supplies for Colonel Qaddafi’s government, which is blockaded by NATO from the sea and pressured overland by rebels from the east.

As the war drags on into summer, capturing Gharyan has become one of the rebels’ main goals in western Libya. The rebels say that as many as 900 of Colonel Qaddafi’s soldiers are garrisoned there, backed by rockets and artillery, and that others are occupying villages and blocking positions along the roads from the west, making the approaches perilous.

Both sides suffered in the battle on Wednesday. At least 13 pro-Qaddafi soldiers and 7 rebels were killed. Many more were wounded, and the rebels claimed to have captured at least 15 soldiers.

After seizing Qawalish, the rebels did not press farther. Many of their fighters pulled back to the west in the midafternoon as Colonel Qaddafi’s soldiers shelled the village. After several ground-to-ground rockets exploded with roars that shook the town, scores of the rebels ran to their cars and trucks and sped away, leaving behind what appeared to be a holding force.

As the main body of rebels backed up, firing weapons in the air triumphantly, their behavior in the fight reflected the mix of enthusiasm, inexperience and poor state of equipment that has defined the anti-Qaddafi forces throughout Libya for much of the war.

When the rebels pushed into Qawalish with trucks crammed with fighters, some trucks contained only one rifle for every three or even four men. And when they moved forward on the village, the fighters stayed largely on the road or near its shoulders, neglecting to sweep and secure their flanks.

At one point, the advance carried the rebels past a Qaddafi mortar position just behind a short, steep ridge off the road. Shortly after the rebels arrived at a cluster of abandoned buildings that had been a Qaddafi defensive position and resupply point, the mortar crew opened fire, shelling the rebels effortlessly as they milled about.

The rounds landed perhaps 75 yards away, explosion after explosion, until most of the rebels drove away — again neglecting to climb the ridge and clear the pro-Qaddafi fighters behind it.

The area near the buildings also revealed the continuing hazards even in places that change hands: antipersonnel and antivehicle land mines that Colonel Qaddafi’s forces had buried along one of their flanks — threats that the rebels said they were just beginning to clear.
182 2011-07-07 Creamer much prefers the question she has fielded over and over in the last year: When are you going to win another?

“I love majors,” said Creamer, who last month tied for third at the L.P.G.A. Championship, the women’s second major of the year. “And now that I know what it takes to win them, it’s more exciting.”

Her four-stroke Open victory at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania was a triumph over adversity, both man-made and mortal. The course, with its deep bunkers and diabolical greens, is considered the toughest Open track the women have played, and Creamer tamed it less than four months after undergoing surgery on her left thumb to repair stretched ligaments.

“I feel like I matured so much as a golfer and a person that week,” she said.

To her delight, Creamer returned to Florida, to a house filled with more than two dozen congratulatory flower bouquets and a letter from Arnold Palmer lauding her achievement.

“I thought that was just very classy,” Creamer said of Palmer. She framed the handwritten note and hung it in her living room.

With the aim of improving her consistency, Creamer has tinkered with the swing that carried her to her major breakthrough. Although she has not won an event since, she has five top-five finishes in 10 starts this year and is coming off back-to-back third-place finishes.

At the L.P.G.A. Championship, Creamer was 11 strokes off the pace of the winner and world No. 1, Yani Tseng, who has finished first or second in four of the last six majors. With a victory this weekend, Tseng, 22, would become the youngest golfer, male or female, to complete a career Grand Slam.

Tseng, a three-time winner in 2011, is in the kind of groove women’s golf has not seen since Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa were active. Sorenstam retired in 2008 and Ochoa in 2010.

The only other time the women’s Open was contested at the Broadmoor, in 1995, Sorenstam, then 24, won the first of her 10 major titles.

Sorenstam won her second at the next year’s Open, a feat Creamer is keen to match. She recognizes that no matter how many more Grand Slam titles she wins, the spoils of her 2010 victory will be hard to surpass.

They included an honorary membership at Oakmont and the opportunity to play at Augusta National this spring as the guest of the Oakmont president, who is a member. In two loops around the Masters course, Creamer scored a 75 and an even-par 72.

Until it came time to return it, the trophy from Oakmont sat on Creamer’s kitchen table, a centerpiece that fueled her hunger for achievement.

“It’s great to relive all those memories,” Creamer said, “but at the same time, I don’t want that trophy leaving. I want that trophy back.”
183 2011-07-07 WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Federal regulators will be able to take back up to two years of Wall Street executives’ pay if they are found responsible for the collapse of a major financial firm, under a plan approved Wednesday.

The provision is part of a broader Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation rule laying out the order in which creditors will be paid during a government liquidation of a large, failing financial firm.

The Dodd-Frank financial oversight law gives financial agencies the power to recoup executives’ pay, but bankers were complaining that regulators were taking it too far.

The F.D.I.C.’s final rule provided some relief by clarifying “negligence” as the standard. The agency was careful to point out that it was not using the more narrow standard of “gross negligence.”

John Walsh, the acting comptroller of the currency, who had raised concerns about the standard being too broad, said he was pleased with the changes.

“I was concerned that it seemed to focus more on job titles than the actual actions that people had taken,” he said.
184 2011-07-07 LONDON — Britain ’s Parliament on Wednesday collectively turned on Rupert Murdoch , the head of the News Corporation , and the tabloid culture he represents, using a debate about a widening phone hacking scandal to denounce reporting tactics by newspapers once seen as too politically influential to challenge.

But though he joined in the chorus of outrage, Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative Party benefits from Mr. Murdoch’s support, stopped short of calling for an immediate investigation into behavior by the Murdoch-owned News of the World and other tabloids. Such an inquiry would have to wait, he said, until the police had concluded their own criminal investigation.

From all sides of the House of Commons the disgust came thick and fast, as the legislators recited the most recent allegations against The News of the World: that its executives had paid police officers, lied to Parliament and hired investigators to intercept voice mail messages left on the cellphones of murdered children and terrorism victims. Legislators also attacked the news media in general for employing many of the same tactics.

The scandal posed new hurdles for Mr. Murdoch’s proposed $12 billion takeover of the pay-television company British Sky Broadcasting, as many legislators criticized the deal, and Britain’s media regulatory agency, Ofcom, said it was “closely monitoring the situation.”

“We have let one man have far too great a sway over our national life,” said Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament. In addition to The News of the World, Mr. Murdoch’s media holdings include The Times of London; The Sun; and a large stake in BSkyB, as it is called, as well as several other international newspapers and television networks.

Meanwhile, John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture and media committee, rehearsed in tones of high indignation how executives from The News of the World and its parent company, News International, had thwarted legislators’ efforts to get to the bottom of the phone hacking affair by stonewalling, refusing to testify and even lying outright during parliamentary hearings.

Zac Goldsmith, another Conservative legislator, said that Mr. Murdoch was guilty of “systemic abuse of almost unprecedented power” and had run roughshod over Parliament.

“There is nothing noble in what these newspapers have been doing,” he said. “Rupert Murdoch is clearly a very, very talented businessman — he’s possibly even a genius — but his organization has grown too powerful and has abused that power. It has systematically corrupted the police and in my view has gelded this Parliament, to our shame.”

A number of legislators, including Nicholas Soames, a Conservative, said Wednesday that in light of the recent developments, the government should intervene to delay or even stop Mr. Murdoch’s plan to acquire all the shares of BSkyB.

“I urge the government to look at whether we should pause things given what has come to light,” said Anna Soubry, a Conservative member of Parliament.

Before this week, the deal had passed virtually every government hurdle. But Ofcom, the media regulator, said in a statement that it was watching developments in the case, “and in particular the investigations by the relevant authorities into the alleged unlawful activities.”

Many legislators also focused their outrage on Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor who is now News International’s chief executive and a protégé of Mr. Murdoch. She is a close friend of Mr. Cameron’s — the two have country houses near each other and have often socialized — and has been a strong champion of his premiership.

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said flatly that Ms. Brooks should resign.

But Ms. Brooks said she would stay put, and on Wednesday her boss, Mr. Murdoch, took the unusual step of issuing a statement on the matter.

Calling the recent allegations involving phone hacking and paying off the police “deplorable and unacceptable,” Mr. Murdoch pledged that the company would “fully and proactively cooperate with the police in all investigations.” He added: “That is exactly what News International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah Brooks’s leadership.”

194 2011-07-08 How has the M.B.A. migration been lately?

It’s heating up again, but it’s still not anything near like it was in ’99. And even though people love to badmouth ’99 and 2000, you also have to remember that’s when Google got built.

After hearing a story about Foursquare’s co-founder, Dennis Crowley, walking into a press event in athletic wear and eating a banana, I developed a theory that bubbles might be predicted by fashion: when tech founders can’t be bothered to appear businesslike, the power has shifted too much in their favor.

Believe it or not, this goes deep into the interior mentality of the engineer, which is very truth-oriented. When you’re dealing with machines or anything that you build, it either works or it doesn’t, no matter how good of a salesman you are. So engineers not only don’t care about the surface appearance, but they view attempts to kind of be fake on the surface as fundamentally dishonest.

That reminds me of Mark Zuckerberg’s criticism of ‘‘The Social Network.’’ He said that ‘‘filmmakers can’t get their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things.’’

Aaron Sorkin was completely unable to understand the actual psychology of Mark or of Facebook. He can’t conceive of a world where social status or getting laid or, for that matter, doing drugs, is not the most important thing.

People view you as an oracle in the valley. I was hoping you’d blow my mind with something you see in the future. Gordon Bell at Microsoft is working on wearable computing, where it literally records everything around you all the time — video, your conversations. He wants to get to where it’s like a pendant around your neck. We also have a company called Jawbone that makes peripherals for smart phones and tablets. Today, they sell Bluetooth headsets and speakers, but soon they will sell all kinds of wearable computing devices.

Will we soon be dealing with antigaming laws so that drivers can’t play wearable video games while driving down the highway?

That assumes they’re driving. Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don’t have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the D.M.V. and look around, you’re like, Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers. Ten to 20 years out, driving your car will be viewed as equivalently immoral as smoking cigarettes around other people is today.

198 2011-07-08 Countless musical groups have been built on a complementary pair: John Lennon and Paul McCartney, say, or Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. A Tribe Called Quest, the influential 1990s hip-hop ensemble, had Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. With “Beats, Rhymes & Life,” the actor Michael Rapaport (Brad Pitt’s roommate in “True Romance”), in his feature directorial debut, does an admirable job recounting the group’s formation and dissecting its dissolution.

Q-Tip and Phife were childhood friends who grew up in Queens following pioneers of East Coast rap like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. What they brought was a smoother, more sophisticated flow incorporating jazz influences. Part of the Native Tongues, a collective comprising De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers, among others, A Tribe Called Quest struck gold with albums like “The Low End Theory” (1991) and hits like “Bonita Applebum” and “Check the Rhime.” The likes of the Beastie Boys and Questlove of the Roots testify to its place in the pantheon.

Q-Tip — dapper, handsome, business savvy — is the McCartney here; Phife — short, scrappy, astringent — the Lennon. Phife brought the street; Q-Tip, in Phife’s words, “the paper.” The other members, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the thoughtful Jarobi White, assumed recessive roles. Mounting tension over control and frontman status eventually proved insurmountable, aggravated by Phife’s struggles with diabetes (his patient wife donated a kidney to him), and the group disbanded in 1998. (Q-Tip is a solo headliner at this year’s Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival, which starts Monday.)

The film catches up with the still-bickering Tribe on the Rock the Bells reunion tour in 2008, offering faint hope: one more album remains in its record contract.

“Beats, Rhymes & Life” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Profanity.

Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.

Directed by Michael Rapaport; director of photography, Robert Benavides; edited by Lenny Mesina; music by Madlib; produced by Edward Parks, Frank Mele, Mr. Rapaport, Eric Matthies, Mr. Benavides, Debra Koffler and ATCQ; released by Sony Pictures Classics. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes.
199 2011-07-08 “Jason Bay said it was like hitting a stinking shot-put, it’s so heavy,” Collins said.

The Mets loaded the bases in the eighth inning off Kershaw and in the ninth inning against reliever Kenley Jansen, but failed to score both times. Hong-Chih Kuo got the final two outs to preserve the shutout.

Angel Pagan led off the game with a single to left field against the left-handed Kershaw, an All-Star, before stealing second base. But he was stranded there, no Mets runner reached second again until the eighth. By then, the Dodgers already led by six runs.

Kershaw’s performance underscored Collins’s concerns about the stout pitching the Mets would be facing over a seven-game span that began Thursday night.

Collins pointed out on Wednesday that after Kershaw, the Mets would go on to face Ryan Vogelsong, Tim Lincecum and Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants, perhaps followed by Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels of the Phillies right after the All-Star break.

With that string of top-flight pitchers on the agenda, Collins was hoping to have Reyes back from his hamstring injury. But on Thursday the Mets were forced to place him on the disabled list because he was making slow progress in his recovery.

Perhaps the reality that Reyes would not be with them for at least two more weeks had a demoralizing effect on the Mets. After several weeks of terrific baseball, they looked lifeless and sloppy against the Dodgers.

Gee allowed six runs, five of them earned, in five and two-thirds innings, and has now allowed 16 earned runs in his last four starts. His record fell to 8-3.

He threw 86 pitches, 30 of them in the sixth inning as the Dodgers scored five times to blow the game open.

The Dodgers’ first run of the game came on what appeared to Umpire Greg Gibson’s second blown call in two nights, both of which went against the Mets. On Wednesday he called Matt Kemp safe at first base when he appeared to be out, and during an on-field argument he admitted to Collins that he made a mistake.

In the second inning on Thursday, Gibson called Juan Uribe safe at home on a sacrifice fly when it appeared that he, too, was out.

Uribe was on third when Aaron Miles hit a fly ball to left field. Jason Bay made a sensational throw to catcher Ronny Paulino, who seemed to apply the tag to Uribe’s leg before his front foot crossed the plate. Paulino couldn’t believe the call, and for the second straight night Collins came out to argue.

They didn’t get the call, but in the ninth Gibson called enough balls for the Mets to load the bases on a single and two walks against Jansen. But Kuo struck out Lucas Duda and got Pagan to ground out to end the game.

So the Mets fell to 4-1 since Reyes was hurt, but are 0-1 since he was put on the disabled list.
200 2011-07-08 The recommendations are efforts to forge a compromise between the sides in the hopes of getting states and cities to adopt the rules. But the proposals are likely to heighten the antagonism between interested parties with vehemently opposing views.

“We expect a lot of pushback,” said Robert H. Attmore, the chairman of the accounting standards board, in an interview.

Public pension policy has grown increasingly polarized as municipalities and state governments face mounting pension costs at the same time that overall state revenues have constricted in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Workers, unions, government officials and consultants who work for public pension funds contend that a full-blown accounting overhaul is unnecessary, and they suspect hidden agendas. They view substantial changes as a way to weaken public employees’ unions and take benefits away, or as an opportunity for outside interests to get a crack at managing some of the billions held in pension trusts.

But economists and other proponents of significant changes argue that official pension numbers are fundamentally inaccurate. They warn that the current pension portrayals mask a looming fiscal breakdown as more and more public workers retire, threatening taxpayers whose own retirement plans have been shredded since 2008. Those taxpayers must still pay higher taxes to finance the pensions of public workers, some of whom can retire in their 50s, sometimes even in their 40s.

Rather than choose sides in the dispute, the rule makers have charted a third course, Mr. Attmore said.

“Nobody believes that it’s going to be exactly correct,” he said. “We’re trying to get as close as we can to what we think economic reality will be.”

The most closely watched issue for the board has been how to measure the value, in today’s dollars, of all the pension benefits that governments must pay in the future. The process involves the use of a rate, known as a discount rate, to convert between dollars in the future and dollars today.

For years, economists and other analysts have complained that the current accounting rules call for governments to use a rate that is much too high, greatly understating the cost of the benefits they have promised, and making unsustainable plans look viable. Since public pensions are protected by state laws and constitutions, they have urged the accounting board to require a rate like the one for safe investments like Treasury bills.

The other side responds that most public pension plans look viable because they really are viable. It has urged the accounting board to preserve the current method, in which governments use their expected rates of return on the assets in their pension funds.

The accounting board’s proposed solution would require governments to blend the two rates. Each government would be required to project all the pensions owed in the coming decades and all the investment returns it expects. By analyzing these cash-flow projections, governments would be able to see whether they were setting enough money aside, and if not, which year in the future they would run out, called the “cross-over point.”

Until now, analysts who have warned that some pension funds could run out of money and tried to estimate when have been accused of fear-mongering and using faulty assumptions. Mr. Attmore said the rule makers hoped to keep the projections honest by making governments explain how they calculated their cross-over points.

In addition, governments would have to provide a sensitivity analysis, showing how changes in their assumptions would affect their final numbers.

After projecting how many years their pension assets would last, each government would use that information to calculate its own discount rate. It would be a blend, combining the rate governments now use for the years up to the cross-over point, and a more punitive low-risk rate for the years after that. The low-risk rate would be based on an index of tax-exempt municipal bonds, Mr. Attmore said.

Governments would then spread the cost over the estimated working lives of their employees. If the portion that workers have already earned exceeds the fair value of the pension assets, the excess would go onto the government’s balance sheet. Benefits that workers expect to earn in the future would not be shown on the balance sheet, Mr. Attmore said. Currently, all pension disclosures are tucked away in footnotes.

This method might not satisfy critics, Mr. Attmore acknowledged, but it would shine a bright light on the public plans at greatest risk of running out of money, or those whose burdens would crowd out required government services. If adopted, the new rules would give governments an adjustment period, rather than demanding big, controversial changes overnight.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating certain states’ and cities’ pension numbers for possible fraud, but Mr. Attmore said he could not comment on the legal implications for governments whose current methods would not be allowed in the future.
201 2011-07-08 The stubbornly high level of the foreclosure inventory here also seems to have a negative impact on housing prices in neighborhoods without a large number of foreclosures. A report from the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index, a leading measure of the health of the residential housing market, said Chicago single-family home prices in April declined 0.4 percent from March while the service’s 20-city index rose 0.7 percent, the first increase in eight months.

“I don’t think you can say that a person in Lincoln Park will hold off buying a home because things are not going well in Pullman,” said Winifred Curran, an associate professor of geography at De Paul University who has studied the foreclosure problems in Chicago. “But there is definitely a ripple effect.” That occurs, she said, when “there is a sense that the city does not have a healthy market.”

Some real estate and foreclosure experts, like Rick Rogers of the Rogers Law Group in Bannockburn, expressed skepticism about the numbers. Mr. Rogers said it often took far longer to foreclose on properties in states like Florida, Nevada and Michigan. Ms. Curran of DePaul also said the RealtyTrac numbers trended high.

But RealtyTrac says it compiles data from more than 2,200 counties throughout the United States to create a report on the top 20 metropolitan areas that conform to United States Census tracts.

The May 2011 RealtyTrac data, in which the foreclosure inventory here drifted lower from prior months as sales picked up slightly, said the Los Angeles area ranked second, with 86,745 homes either owned by banks or in the process of foreclosure. New York City ranks third with 84,600.

The data, which go back to January 2008 — when the bursting of the years-long housing bubble was first gaining national attention — show that the Chicago region has consistently ranked near the top in the listings.

The data suggest that banks and real estate agents in the area do not sell foreclosed properties as rapidly as they do in places like Miami, where home prices soared but then fell quickly.

Chicago sells fewer foreclosed homes each month than any other major metropolitan area except New York, where state laws similar to Illinois’s offer protections that make it hard for banks to drive borrowers from their homes. During the first five months of the year, for instance, an average 4,004 foreclosed homes in Phoenix were sold each month. The monthly averages were only 1,697 foreclosed-home sales in Chicago, while 762 foreclosed properties sold in New York.

Ms. Curran at DePaul said that the housing boom in places like Miami had been so hot that banks became more desperate when prices plummeted and were more willing to sell at lower prices than in the Midwest, where housing prices rose but at a much slower pace than in other places.

“I think it’s the banks; they are not willing to lower prices,” said John Bouman, president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, an advocacy organization for low-income people. “So these properties just sit there empty because they don’t want to sell it at a lower price and lose the money they have in it.”

Mr. Bouman, who lives in Maywood, said the foreclosure problems had made it difficult for his family. The house across the street from him has been vacant for more than a year, he said, and he knows of two prospective buyers who inquired about the property but could not get satisfactory answers from the bank.

Mr. Bouman said he and his wife had thought about selling their house and moving to a condominium in Chicago, but the glut of foreclosures had depressed prices so much that he could not get enough money for his house to afford one.

“Sometimes I think that it’s hard to find anyone at the banks who can make a decision,” Mr. Bouman said, “so these properties just sit there.”

Geoff Smith, a senior vice president at the Woodstock Institute, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in housing issues, said one factor contributing to Chicago’s slow sales rate was that Illinois is a judicial state that requires banks to go through a court system to foreclose on a property rather than simply filing a notice to the borrower. Numerous consumer safeguards typically slow down the process and cause a backlog of cases in the courts.

Mr. Smith said the “robo-signing” scandal currently under investigation by Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, also contributed to the slower pace. “Robo-signing” refers to the robotic generation of erroneous or fraudulent loan documents by companies that service mortgage loans. Some foreclosures were based on fake documents, giving homeowners an opportunity to challenge the right of financial institutions to seize the property.

“Problems were generated by the servicers not processing these correctly,” Mr. Smith said. “This led to government intervention. The state had to make sure its citizens were protected.”

According to a study done by Nicholas Bianchi of National People’s Action, a national community rights organization, the nation’s five largest banks — Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, J. P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citibank and US Bank — are involved in three of every five foreclosures in Cook County. Mr. Bianchi’s study says most foreclosures also occurred in black and Latino neighborhoods.

Several banks declined to comment about the reasons for the slow pace of sales here.

Daren Blomquist, the marketing and communications director at RealtyTrac, said he thought there was a big difference between foreclosures in the Midwest and the West, where the real estate boom drove prices sharply higher.

Foreclosures of western properties tended to be in sought-after suburbs, he said, but in Chicago they came in older, economically weaker neighborhoods.

“In the West, there were a lot of foreclosures on newer properties in suburbs that might be more desirable to someone trying to get back into the market,” he said.

In contrast, Mr. Blomquist said foreclosures in the Midwest tended to be in neighborhoods where the property might have been more vulnerable to neglect or vandalism.
202 2011-07-08 “It’s the bane of my existence,” said Ian Melven, whose third-floor condominium overlooks the building. “It’s a little worrying. Who knows what’s going on in there?”

Avant Housing, a local real estate developer, acquired the property last year. Even in its current state, it is valued at more than $7.4 million by the city’s Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Avant has a $60 million plan to build 202 apartments on the site.

Indeed, for the better part of a decade there have been plans to build housing there, but they have been delayed for various circumstances, including lawsuits, financing problems and a previous owner’s death. The city has become wary in recent years of allowing buildings to be demolished unless new construction starts immediately.

The Planning Department said approval for the latest plans could be just weeks away.

In the meantime, neighbors say they are tired of having to be vigilant and report problems. “It’s a blight on a real up-and-coming block,” Mr. Melven said.

In response to the neighbors’ complaints, city resources are being spent on private property.

Last week, workers for the Department of Public Works painted over graffiti on the building, a chore that one crew member said was performed regularly. (In fact, graffiti returned within hours.)

Avant Housing is a joint venture of the San Francisco developers AGI Capital and TMG Partners, with financing from CalPERS, the California Public Employees Retirement System, which has come under fire in recent years for questionable investments. AGI Capital is listed as the contact on city permit applications, but executives did not respond to repeated requests to discuss the property. A receptionist who answered the phone for Avant Housing laughed when I asked for an interview.

Only after I contacted CalPERS, which reportedly has $100 million of state workers’ retirement money invested with Avant Housing, did anyone respond.

Questions were referred to Julie Chase, a public relations expert hired by Avant Housing, who at first said there had been no problems. When told that the issues had been witnessed firsthand over the course of weeks, including the building’s being left open at night, Ms. Chase said, “You were there at night?”

In February, according to the Department of Building Inspection, the building’s owners paid $765 to register the property as a vacant building, complying with a city ordinance passed in 2009.

The ordinance, meant to help the city track and exert more control over an estimated 400 vacant properties, requires owners to secure and maintain their buildings, abate graffiti and conspicuously post their contact information. Repeated visits to 1886 Mission Street in recent weeks found no such posting.

Under the ordinance, violators can be fined up to $6,885; in just two years, $157,000 in fines have already been levied citywide.

But the city has not fined Avant Housing.

William Strawn, spokesman for the Department of Building Inspection, said in an e-mail, “Our enforcement philosophy is to work with property owners and ensure they meet legal code requirements, rather than to collect fines and penalties.”

But the company will receive a bill for the paint job, said Gloria Chan, spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works.

“We had to step in there and do it,” Ms. Chan said, explaining that the city intervenes when graffiti is chronic or profane (graffiti cleanup efforts citywide cost taxpayers $20 million annually). Private property owners are charged a minimum of $400 for graffiti abatement, plus a $250 fine.

Ms. Chase said that Avant Housing had private contracts for graffiti abatement and security, but that police officers entered the building last week to remove people who were illegally inside.

All involved agree that the many problems at 1886 Mission Street could be easily solved — with a wrecking ball.
203 2011-07-08 Arrested again on July 8, he was chief reporter covering the royal family. He served four months in jail after pleading guilty in January 2007 to hacking the phone messages of aides to the royal family. A letter he wrote in 2007, challenging his dismissal because his actions “were carried out with the full knowledge and support” of other senior journalists, was made public on Aug. 16 and contradicted editors’ and executive’s claims that they were unaware of of the phone hacking.

Served six months in jail for his role in the hacking scandal of 2006. He was hired by Clive Goodman. Revelations from his private notes, seized by police for the initial investigation, are at the center of many of the new allegations. In response to public “vilification,” he made a statement of public apology in The Guardian on July 5.

Arrested on April 5 as part of the investigation into phone hacking. His first name was found in Glenn Mulcaire’s notes, an indication that executives of News International had access to information suggesting that multiple reporters were engaged in phone hacking.

Arrested on April 5 as part of the investigation into phone hacking. He was fired in January after a forensic computer specialist found three e-mail messages sent to Mr. Edmundson with PIN codes for accessing voice mail. His first name was also found Glenn Mulcaire’s notes. When The News of the World moved offices in 2010, the computer Mr. Edmondson used was destroyed in what the company described as a standard procedure.

Arrested on April 14. He was hired by Andy Coulson in 2004 and was said to have worked closely with Ian Edmundson.

Arrested on Aug. 10 as part of the phone hacking investigation. Was assistant editor under Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. His name appears on a contract with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire that has been of great interest to the parliamentary committee investigating the phone hacking. On July 21 he surfaced in Florida, saying he was talking to the British police about the investigation and preparing to return to Britain.

Arrested on Aug. 2 as part of the investigation into phone hacking and police bribery. As managing editor of The News of the World for 22 years until 2009, he was responsible for the paper's finances during the period in question. In testimony to Parliament, Rebekah Brooks said all payments to private investigators would have gone through his office. James and Rupert Murdoch said they did not know whether his departure, immediately before new reports of phone hacking surfaced, was related to those accusations.

Arrested Aug. 18 for the investigation into phone hacking. An award-winning Hollywood reporter, he started working at The News of the World in 2005 and was promoted to be a Los Angeles-based editor for the paper in 2009.

Sky News reported he was arrested Aug. 19 in connection with the phone hacking investigation. He was suspended from his job as a reporter for The News of the World in 2010 when his name emerged in a phone-hacking civil suit against the paper.
204 2011-07-08 “We have a true home-field advantage with Andy in Austin,” Jim Courier, the United States captain, said Thursday. “You know, he’s roughly the mayor of this town.”

Roddick, a 10-year veteran of Davis Cup play, lobbied hard to get the quarterfinal in Austin. In 1992, at age 10, Roddick went to Fort Worth to watch Courier and the United States defeat Switzerland in the Davis Cup final. The raucous, vibrant crowd and the cheering, clanging cowbells and airhorns left a lasting impression on him. Roddick hopes the crowd in Austin will create a similar atmosphere this year.

“Just seeing the people go mental for tennis, ‘USA’ chants, flags, all sorts of stuff,” Roddick said. “It left me with a dream.”

With Nadal sitting out of the quarterfinal, Ferrer will play as Spain’s top seed.

Nadal, who was part of Spain’s Davis Cup-winning teams in 2004, 2008 and 2009, said he needed time off after Wimbledon. He criticized the timing of playing a Davis Cup quarterfinal just one week later.

Both teams are full of players who were at Wimbledon. Fish lost to Nadal in the quarterfinals. Lopez beat Roddick in the third round. Ferrer made it to the quarterfinals, and the American team of Bob and Mike Bryan won the Wimbledon doubles championship.

“For sure, Rafael is a very important player in our team, but right now he is not here,” said Albert Costa, Spain’s captain. “We have these four players, they know how to win Davis Cup. They are very experienced. For sure they will play with passion, with heart.”

Costa said being in Austin could affect Roddick.

“Big pressure for him to play with his public, his people, his country,” Costa said.

Roddick appeared loose enough while hamming up a prematch news conference with jokes and funny faces. In the crowd was Roddick’s second-grade teacher.

“Thank you for teaching me to read,” Roddick said. “That was great of you. It’s served me well.”

The quarterfinal also will be the first Davis Cup home tie for Courier as the United States captain. A four-time Grand Slam event winner and a former Davis Cup singles player, Courier made his Davis Cup debut as captain in March in a first-round win over Chile in Santiago.

As hosts, the Americans got to choose the court surface and picked a hard and fast acrylic they hope will help big hitters like Fish and Roddick.

“It’s a little bit faster than normal,” said Lopez, who beat Roddick on grass at Wimbledon. “But this is what we expected.”

Picking the court surface is part of squeezing out every advantage possible for the home team, Courier said.

“The mandate is not for us to find a court that suits everyone, it’s to find a court that suits ourselves within the rules, which is what we’ve done,” Courier said. “It’s playing beautifully.”

Spain and the United States have met nine previous times in Davis Cup play, with Spain holding a 5-4 series lead. Nadal led Spain to a 4-1 semifinal win in 2008. The only time they met in the final was a 3-2 Spanish victory in 2004.

“We’ve had a lot of battles against them, you know, especially over there on the dirt,” Mike Bryan said. “I don’t want to say there’s a rivalry, but there is.”
205 2011-07-08 A hitter’s accomplishments are therefore cumulative. Even if you’re talented and lucky, you ooze your way to greatness. Along the way, you are never sure exactly where you fit into the landscape of other players’ journeys — past, present or future. You spend much of your time just hoping to keep the ooze moving forward, worrying that it may swallow you whole the minute you let up.

I amassed 1,100 total hits at the major league level, over almost nine full seasons. Only once did I surpass the single-season magic number of 200 hits, something Jeter has already done seven times. To get 3,000 hits, you have to average 200 hits for 15 seasons — a phenomenal career. By the time Jeter turned 25, he was in his fifth year and working on his second 200-hit season. I didn’t even arrive in the major leagues until I was 25.

And Jeter has done it all outside the taint of the scandal. His name is absent from subpoenas, and the on illegal substances, and leaked lists of suspect players. Most major leaguers who play a long time experience a bell curve in the arc of their careers. You spend a few years figuring out how to be a peak performer, reach the top of your game for a little while, then fall into a slow, downhill drift to . Your only braking mechanism is the resistance that comes with denial. Rarely do players voluntarily ride into the sunset. Instead, a seasoned manager will find a way to put your pink slip into words, or you might end up licking your wounds after having failed to catch on with a team in .

Jeter’s career has been more like a plateau curve. He came on the scene at 20, made a near-instant impact, then stayed remarkably consistent and virtually injury-free year in and year out, cruising on a plane of excellence. In many respects, he spoiled us. When you progress on a flat line, outside observers are lulled into the tacit expectation that this is how it’s supposed to be. Players like this produce so deceptively that we miss the escalating work ethic required to stave off age, the sheer dominating focus it takes to be so steady at such a high level.

Now we are watching him slow down, finding out that not even Jeter can avoid the human condition. The fact that the Yankees won 14 of 18 games during his recent time on the D.L. is a reminder that even great personal accomplishment stands on shaky ground when it comes to a humming team machine. So Jeter has two ways to go. He could take his foot off the pedal and ride gravity down the gradual curve to the bottom. Or, it could end much as it began for him and he’ll go down as precipitously as he rose in the game, though his superhero status in the eyes of his supporters may grant him a parachute to soften the landing.

Meanwhile, we’ve enjoyed the counting, hit by hit. And once my kids start to learn about numbers in the thousands, I will tell them that the story of Derek Jeter’s journey to 3,000 wasn’t about numbers at all. It was really about the infinite nature of human possibility.
206 2011-07-08 Of the two, one was predictably so nervous in the days leading to Thursday that she had a recurring nightmare in which she was standing on the first tee but could not make a free swing because a towering pine stood in her way.

That would be King, whose personality developed a sandpaper edge from grinding during tournament weeks.

“That was one thing that was nice about retirement — the golf nightmares stopped,” King said with a laugh. She allowed that the week has been stressful.

Galdiano, who will enter the eighth grade in the fall, had no trouble digesting her pre-round breakfast, which consists of a bowl of Frosted Flakes and a banana. “She’s very calm,” Marivic Galdiano said while following her daughter’s round from outside the ropes. Galdiano’s aunt, Nora, who was walking alongside her mother, added, “Even in the hotel room today, she was telling us to calm down.”

Galdiano, who is barely 5 feet tall, exudes a maturity that led one man following her group to remark to another, “She looks like she’s 18.”

She is most often compared to Michelle Wie, another native Hawaiian who made her Open debut at 13 and turned pro before she finished high school. During a brief conversation on Wednesday, King, who starred at Furman, said she encouraged Galdiano to attend college before turning professional.

King exudes an agelessness that makes people wonder why she chose to retire when she did, at 49, while her contemporary, Juli Inkster, has continued to compete and contend into her 50s.

“To be honest, if I could play well enough to play, I’d still be playing,” said King, who cashed one check in 10 events in 2005, her final year on the tour.

With her father, Roger, carrying her bag, Galdiano got off to a promising start. She hit every fairway on the back nine — her first nine — of The Broadmoor’s East course. Her struggles came on the greens, where she could not read the speed.

Galdiano three-putted twice on her first nine holes and made the turn in a three-over-par 38. At the advice of her father, she kept her head down as she made her way around the course so she didn’t become awestruck by the company she was keeping.

A rare exception came at No. 12, a par 3, where Galdiano’s group was delayed several minutes while the players in front of them finished putting. While Galdiano waited, Inkster and her playing partners walked past the tee box on their way to the eighth hole. Inkster smiled and waved at Galdiano, who shyly waved back.

Asked about Galdiano, Sorenstam said: “It’s not about how young you are. It’s how you play. I certainly hope that, again, just enjoy the week, have fun, and not too much pressure on herself. It’s very competitive out here.”

It’s not about how old you are, either, which is what King kept telling herself.

“You know, when you’re competitive, it comes out,” she said. “Obviously, you like to do well.” She added, “So you know, however many shots I take, I’m going to give 100 percent on every one.”

For all their differences, Galdiano and King shared one goal: to be around for the weekend.

“I think, to be honest,” King said, “if I could make the cut, that would be a pretty good week.”
207 2011-07-08 Now the Internet providers are hoping to profit as they pipe music and video of the nonpirated variety to their customers.

“The I.S.P.’s want to cooperate with Hollywood because the carriers recognize that their own growth depends in part on bundled content strategies,” said Eric Garland of BigChampagne, which tracks online media traffic. “They don’t want to be just utilities providing Internet access, but premium content distributors as well.”

The system announced on Thursday involves a series of six warnings that an Internet provider can send to a customer whom the media companies have identified as a possible copyright infringer.

The warnings escalate from simple e-mail notifications to, at levels 5 and 6, a set of “mitigation measures,” like reduced connection speeds or a block on Web browsing. As the alerts progress, a customer must acknowledge that he understands the notice. Customers will also have the opportunity to contest the complaint.

The effect on consumers, the companies hope, will be more of a deterrent-by-annoyance — rather than the random lightning bolt of litigation that was once the preferred method of enforcement by the recording industry association, one of the parties to the agreement.

The media companies were also represented by the and groups acting on behalf of independent record companies and filmmakers. The Internet carriers involved in the deal include , , Comcast, Verizon and .

The music and movie companies, which estimate that digital piracy costs the economy $16 billion in lost revenue each year, have been eager for an efficient way to deal with the problem.

As illegal downloading has become ingrained as a cultural habit, especially among young people, expensive litigation has become less effective, and the lawsuits against individuals were something of a public relations disaster for the music companies. The new deal, the companies say, offers plenty of chances for even the most recalcitrant pirates to reform.

“This is a sensible approach to the problem of online content theft and, importantly, one that respects the privacy and rights of our subscribers,” Randal S. Milch, executive vice president and general counsel for Verizon, said in a statement.

The agreement has an unlikely origin: it came about as a result of an effort to crack down on that was led by while he was the New York attorney general.

In 2008, Mr. Cuomo, who is now the governor, brokered a deal in which several major Internet providers agreed to block access to online sources of child pornography. Seeing this, the recording industry association approached Mr. Cuomo for help with music piracy, said Cary H. Sherman, the association’s president.

“We pointed out to him that there are overlaps between the child porn problem and piracy,” Mr. Sherman said, because all kinds of files, legal and otherwise, are traded on peer-to-peer networks.

Mr. Cuomo led the early talks between the Internet carriers and entertainment companies, and on Thursday he issued a statement praising the deal.

The agreement, he said, “provides a rational and thoughtful solution — a solution that respects the rights of copyright holders as well as I.S.P.’s and their customers — to a problem that has plagued the Internet.”

Under the agreement, the content owners will deliver evidence of illegal file-sharing to the Internet providers, which are then responsible for sending alerts and meting out penalties. The Internet providers will not disclose the identity of the offending customer to the media companies.

Many media and arts groups applauded the deal, saying that it would more effectively reduce piracy and therefore benefit the creators of music and movies, whose fortunes have eroded over the last decade.

Others, including Public Knowledge, an Internet rights group, and the Center for Democracy and Technology expressed concerns that consumers might be punished “based on allegations that have not been tested in court.”

Many Internet music experts expressed doubt that the alert system would succeed in stamping out piracy. The new system largely aims for peer-to-peer file-sharing tools like BitTorrent. But plenty of other technologies exist for enterprising pirates, many of which might allow them to evade easy detection.

“The challenge is that consumers will continue to do whatever they wish on the Internet, and find clever ways to not attract the attention of the content companies or I.S.P.’s,” said Mr. Garland of BigChampagne, whose company has long traced the proliferation of file-sharing. “It will never end.”
208 2011-07-08 It can be tough to see the story in “Ironclad” for all the squirting blood and the severed tongues, feet, hands and heads — never mind the mighty distractions provided by some seriously furious eyeball-rolling. Many of the most frenzied ocular calisthenics are provided by Paul Giamatti, who also gives his English accent a vigorous workout to play King John. This was the 13th-century monarch who waged a battle royal against the barons who had forced him to sign the Magna Carta, a foundational document of modern democracy and an absurd excuse for such go-go gore.

A son of Eleanor of Aquitaine and brother of Richard the Lionheart as well as a juicy fictional foe (when played by Claude Rains) of Robin Hood, John is sometimes referred to as Bad King John, as readers of A. A. Milne’s “Now We Are Six” may recall: “King John was not a good man, he had his little ways.” The movie indicates that those little ways were indeed petty, numerous and cruel and here, at least, begin after he signs the Magna Carta. The ink on the charter barely dry, he gathers an army that includes loads of mangy Danes and wages war against the barons (Brian Cox included), who are being advised by an archbishop (Charles Dance) and aided by a Knight Templar, Marshall (James Purefoy).

Mr. Purefoy, an attractive screen presence forced to do a lot of glowering, makes a solid center in a largely appealing ensemble that includes Derek Jacobi as Reginald de Cornhill, whose Rochester castle serves as the hub of the bloody action. There, a cluster of barons and their minions (Jason Flemyng, Mackenzie Crook) hold off the king’s blond hordes. Marshall meanwhile tries (oh, how he tries) to resist the increasingly comic advances of Reginald’s sex-starved wife, Lady Isabel (a badly served Kate Mara), who, with flawless hair and makeup, slinks around the castle like a medieval Maggie the Cat. When she slides up to Marshall and all but rubs herself against him, just close your eyes and think of Elizabeth Taylor.

Directed by Jonathan English, who wrote the script with Erick Kastel and Stephen McDool, “Ironclad” alternately feels, plays and sounds like an abridged television mini-series and a feature-length video game. The action is cluttered and the story overly compressed, with a lot of yammering about who’s aligned with whom and why (no wonder Mr. Giamatti’s eyes keep rolling) in between the geysers of red. There’s nothing new about digital technologies that allow you to experience in pulpy realistic detail all the many, many ways bodies can be sliced and diced, chopped and skewered, roasted and charred. But it’s always instructive to note the enthusiasm with which some directors go in for the cinematic kill: in “Ironclad,” when a man runs for his life, the camera will always be waiting just so you can watch him die.

“Ironclad” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Heads, tongues, hands and feet fly, and bodies are set on fire, skewered like shish kabobs and sliced like rashers of bacon.

209 2011-07-08 The issue electrified the political world, where such advocacy groups, known as 501(c)4 organizations for the section of the tax code under which they are established, have become powerful players in recent years.

Mr. Rove’s group and Priorities USA, a new liberal advocacy group set up by two former Obama administration officials, Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, are attracting ever larger war chests in support of campaigns and causes because they can offer their donors anonymity, unlike political action committees and 527 organizations.

The I.R.S. audits became public just as such groups were ramping up for the 2012 election cycle, and a group of six senators led by Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, wrote to the I.R.S. commissioner Douglas H. Shulman raising concerns that its effort to impose gift taxes on donations to these groups was politically motivated and in violation the First Amendment.

“This decision today ensures that the I.R.S. remains free from even the hint of undue political influence,” Mr. Hatch said in a statement on Thursday.  “It cannot be turned into an arm of political retribution or payback.”

Similarly, David Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, questioned the process the I.R.S had used to challenge the five donors and whether the Obama administration, which has been critical of the increasing power of advocacy groups, was involved.

On Thursday, Mr. Camp issued a statement saying that while he welcomed Mr. Miller’s decision, he remained concerned that the I.R.S. had not ruled out future gift taxes on or audits of such donations. “I remain troubled that the I.R.S. has failed to explain what prompted these audits in the first place,” he said.

The I.R.S. has said that the White House had nothing to do with its audits, and its original statement said they were begun by lower-level employees and that administration officials were not notified. Frank Keith, an I.R.S. spokesman, said Thursday that the estate and gift tax unit had in fact suspended those audits in March, although the agency’s initial confirmation of the audits did not mention any such action.

“All decisions to open, suspend and close the audits were made by career civil servants and were not the result of any outside influence,” Mr. Keith said.

Mr. Miller’s memo today indicated that no new inquiries would be made of donors to such groups until these issues had been studied and a broader policy developed, on a timetable he left open-ended. Greg Colvin, a lawyer for one of the five donors under audit by the I.R.S., called the memo issued Thursday “at least a temporary victory.”

“They might sometime in the future decide to apply the tax,” Mr. Colvin added. “But in my experience, they can go for a very, very long time if they’ve got a tough issue where there is difficult public policy, contradictions, constitutional questions, debate over what Congress intended. They could keep this on ice for decades.”

Mr. Colvin and other lawyers said the I.R.S. turnaround might lead to a spate of refund requests from donors who made contributions to advocacy groups and paid gift taxes. “It makes sense to file a protective claim to avoid losing out by virtue of the statute of limitations expiring,” said Marcus Owens, a lawyer who formerly headed the I.R.S. division that oversees nonprofit groups.

Mr. Keith, the I.R.S. spokesman, said taxpayers had the right to file for a refund of any tax they had paid. “However, I’m not saying how the I.R.S. would treat such a claim, whether it would be honored or denied, and the field directive” — Mr. Miller’s memo — “doesn’t speak to that, either,” he said.
210 2011-07-08 The new regulation, known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, is essentially a rewrite of one issued by the in 2005 but invalidated by a federal judge in 2008. The regulation, known popularly as the transport rule because it is directed at emissions that are carried eastward by prevailing winds, is a significant toughening of the acid rain program that was part of amendments to the in 1990.

The new rule applies to all the states east of the Rockies except the Dakotas, and the six states.

The agency said that utilities could meet the new standards at modest cost by using readily available technology like catalytic converters and smokestack scrubbers. Under some E.P.A. projections, the new rule will create thousands of jobs in pollution-control businesses and significantly increase labor productivity by reducing workdays lost to respiratory and other illnesses.

The utility industry and many Republicans in Congress contend that the new rule, along with other pending E.P.A. air quality regulations, will require the premature closing of dozens of aging plants and impose heavy financial burdens on power companies and their customers. They had asked for a more gradual phase-in of the new rules.

“The E.P.A. is ignoring the cumulative economic damage new regulations will cause,” said Steve Miller, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a group of coal-burning utilities. “America’s coal-fueled electric industry has been doing its part for the environment and the economy, but our industry needs adequate time to install clean coal technologies to comply with new regulations. Unfortunately, E.P.A. doesn’t seem to care.”

An industry-financed study found that new air pollution rules would cost tens of thousands of jobs and cause electricity rates to rise by more than 20 percent in some parts of the country.

Michael J. Bradley, executive director of the Clean Energy Group, a coalition of power companies, said that most utilities had already installed the equipment needed to meet the new standards and that the small number of plants that would be closed were among the oldest and dirtiest in the nation.

Mr. Bradley said that electricity markets had already factored in the price of compliance and that recent auctions had shown there would be adequate supplies of electricity in 2015 at reasonable prices. “The bottom line is, the industry is well positioned to comply with this, has been anticipating this for three to four years now,” he said.

Supporters of the new rule said any costs would be more than offset by health and other benefits. The E.P.A. estimates the annual benefits of the Cross-State Pollution Rule at $120 billion to $280 billion a year by 2014.

John F. Sheehan of the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the new air quality rule would help the in upstate New York, the nation’s largest outside of , to recover from decades of pollution produced far from its borders.

“This is the biggest leap forward in our long history of dealing with this problem,” Mr. Sheehan said. “This is a very deep cut on a very aggressive schedule and essentially enough to end chronic acidification of lakes and ponds in the .”

He said it would allow the regeneration of spruce and fir forests in the six-million-acre park while improving the habitat of dozens of species, from the Bicknell’s thrush at high elevations to brook trout in streams.
211 2011-07-08 It might have been a relatively weak class of free agents, but the spending frenzy that broke out across the N.H.L. last weekend said a lot about the financial and competitive state of the league. From noon Friday to 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, about 100 free agents signed contracts with new N.H.L. clubs or headed to Europe.

Only time will tell if any of the moves will have the positive effect of Boston’s signing of Zdeno Chara on July 1, 2006, or the negative effect of the Rangers’ signing of Wade Redden on July 1, 2008. But at this early stage, some teams and players already appear to have come out winners and losers.

RANGERS, BRAD RICHARDS Both emerged as winners. The Rangers got the playmaking center and power-play ace they sorely needed, and Richards got a big, front-loaded contract that will pay him $12 million next season, tops in the N.H.L. He could have made more elsewhere, but he also got his wish to play on a contender, and his presence makes the Rangers the third- or fourth-best team in the East.

FLYERS, JAROMIR JAGR Both emerged as losers. In his anxiety to sign a No. 1 goalie, Philadelphia General Manager Paul Holmgren blew up the team that reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2010 and finished second in the East last season, trading away Mike Richards and Jeff Carter for salary space and losing the wherewithal to re-sign Ville Leino. He signed Phoenix goalie Ilya Bryzgalov to a huge contract — although goalies like Tomas Vokoun and J. S. Giguere could have been signed at a fraction of the cost — and Jagr, who at 39 is returning to the N.H.L. after three years playing in Russia, was the Flyers’ most significant offensive addition.

Jagr burned bridges by seeming to have misled Mario Lemieux, the Penguins’ owner, about his desire to return to Pittsburgh. “The Penguins seemed like I did something wrong or something bad,” Jagr said. “If I hurt somebody, I apologize, I didn’t mean it, but this is my life, and I want to make the choice.” Penguins fans already had mixed feelings about Jagr — great in the early 1990s, sulky and petulant in the late 1990s — but now they hate him.
212 2011-07-08 “It reflects that despite all the bad news, the consumer still basically feels like they’ve got money in their wallet,” said Al Sambar, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon.

While discount stores turned in the strongest performance as a sector, with sales rising 9 percent, every sector had positive comparable sales. And the companies with the best results and that beat analyst expectations by the widest margins cater to all sorts of shoppers.

Costco, up 14 percent, goes after value-minded shoppers, but also those who have enough to spend on flat-screen TVs and vats of mayonnaise. Saks, where sales rose 11.9 percent, is all about high-price luxury. Kohl’s and Dillard’s, where sales rose 7.5 percent and 6 percent respectively, go after a midrange shopper with lots of promotions and coupons. Zumiez and Wet Seal, which rose 9.8 percent and 7.3 percent respectively, aim for teenagers with mall shops.

June is not a make-or-break month for retailers, which are generally clearing out inventory in anticipation of the back-to-school season. Retailers often mark down leftovers to make room on the floor during June, and promotions were intense at a few stores. Still, many retailers have said that they will be increasing prices later this summer, and some have been testing slightly higher price tags.

“June is somewhat of a transition month for retail,” said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks overall sales. “Some categories are ending one season and getting ready for the next, such as apparel. Other categories are depending more on the summer travel season.”

Discretionary spending seemed to be strong. The SpendingPulse numbers suggested that luxury, jewelry and apparel spending all continued at a brisk pace, and the retailers’ results reflected that.

Kohl’s said that sales of watches and handbags were quite good, for instance, while Saks said that women’s shoes, designer apparel and jewelry were among its best performers, and J.C. Penney also said jewelry had sold well.

Because the shopper seemed to be buoyant, the differences among competitors were getting more pronounced as retailers could no longer blame the economy.

Penney had one of the biggest misses, with its comparable sales results up 2 percent versus analyst expectations of 2.3 percent. The company said that was because of a “softer than anticipated selling environment for J. C. Penney’s moderate customer and the resulting higher level of promotional activity during the quarter.” The company noted that online sales rose 2.2 percent for the month.

Competitors like Macy’s and Kohl’s, though, turned in much stronger results. Kohl’s said home, women’s and children’s products all had big increases. At Macy’s, same-store sales rose 6.7 percent, and Internet sales were up 45 percent in June compared with a year ago, the company said. (The results include both Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s.)

In terms of same-store sales increases, Costco had the biggest jump, with 14 percent. Analysts had expected a 12.7 percent increase. Limited, driven by Victoria’s Secret, continued to shine, with a 12 percent increase, versus analysts’ estimates of 3.8 percent. Saks placed third in the comparable-sales horse race, with sales rising 11.9 percent, versus analysts’ estimates of 7 percent.

Analysts said that the back-to-school picture was still hazy. While the strong results in June indicated consumers were happy to shop, many retailers have said they will raise prices around the back-to-school season because of more expensive goods. “The customer, regardless of all this stuff we’re talking about, is price sensitive,” Mr. Sambar said, and retailers did not yet know whether the shoppers would accept higher prices.
213 2011-07-08 Stocks hit five-week highs on Thursday as data on private sector hiring raised optimism about the economy, while oil prices posted their biggest gain in two months on strong fuel demand.

The euro rose against the dollar for the first time in three sessions after Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, said the bank would relax rules and keep providing liquidity to struggling Portugal, allaying worries about Europe’s debt crisis.

On Wall Street, stocks rallied as surprisingly strong hiring by private employers in June and strong retail sales added to optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.

The payrolls processing company ADP reported that private employers in the United States added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double the 68,000 expected by the market.

“We went through a multimonth period of disappointing data, and now it is coming in better than anticipated, and that reset of expectations is providing a nice tailwind to markets,” said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles.

Zoellick, the World Bank president, said in a statement. Ms. Okonjo-Iweala, 57, has been managing director since late 2007. Before that, she was finance minister and foreign minister in a previous Nigerian government.
222 2011-07-09 A Chinese writer and government critic arrived in Berlin on Wednesday after a journey that included transfers in Hanoi, Vietnam and Warsaw, he said in a telephone interview. The writer, Liao Yiwu, who had been living in Sichuan Province, said the police had visited him often in recent months to deliver veiled threats that if he published any more works abroad, he would be jailed. He was also barred from leaving China to attend a literary festival in Australia in March and removed from a plane in the southwestern city of Chengdu in February on his way to Germany for Europe’s largest literary festival. Mr. Liao is most known for “The Corpse Walker,” a series of interviews with people living in the margins of Chinese society, including a professional mourner, a political prisoner and a public-toilet manager.
223 2011-07-09 Curtis Granderson, the Yankees’ player representative, said Jeter’s proximity to 3,000 hits factored into their voting. But once the Rays balked, as was their right, the teams went back and forth with the players association to find a solution. Granderson said several factors were considered, including how many day-night doubleheaders each team is scheduled to play in the second half of the season.

Cashman said he held no hard feelings against the Rays, and his manager, Joe Girardi, deflected a similar question.

“Whether I’m frustrated or not, it doesn’t really matter,” Girardi said. “We wanted to see this happening for our fans. We thought that was important.”

Evan Longoria, the Rays’ player representative, said it made little baseball sense for his team to agree to play twice Saturday. Longoria did not speak with the Yankees, but as a fellow player he thought that Jeter would loathe the idea of playing a split doubleheader.

“I’m sure Derek would do what’s best for the team, and the best thing for the team is probably not to play a doubleheader,” Longoria said. “It’s to look down the line and get guys healthy right now. I think Derek understands he’s going to get 3,000 hits, whether it’s here or on the road when they start the second half.”

However superstitious Jeter is about jinxes, on some level he understands Longoria’s point: it will happen, eventually. The Yankees agree, but they would prefer he accomplish the feat at home and not during the eight-game trip through Toronto and Tampa Bay that opens the second half.

“I just feel bad for all of these fans,” said Randy Levine, the team’s president. “We can only do what we can do.” Asked if there was any way to accommodate fans who came to watch Jeter, Levine shrugged.

“What can I tell you?” he said. “That’s the problem.”

Fans holding tickets Friday can use them for the rescheduled game, by which point Jeter might be in position to surpass Rod Carew (3,053), Rickey Henderson (3,055) or Craig Biggio (3,060) on the career list.

A fan named Mike Elefante heard the news about the rainout and got ready to embark on a four-hour ride back to Utica. He had field-level seats and would have come back if the game had been rescheduled for Saturday.

“What they’re offering is a consolation prize, Sept. 22,” he said. “It’s the end of the year. Now we don’t get to see history made. Who knows what the end of the year may bring? It might be a competitive game, but today was the day. It’s very disappointing.”

Jeter was not available to speak with reporters after the game was rained out, but earlier in the afternoon he said he noticed the crowd’s reactions recently — loud roars when he walked to the plate, eerie silence as the pitcher set to throw — and appreciated it.

“I know that’s what a lot of people are coming to see and it’s something that hasn’t happened too frequently, it hasn’t happened here,” Jeter said. “So, yeah, I’m aware of it.”

Jeter understands the intense focus on his chase, but he seems uncomfortable with how much it has directed attention away from the team, which had lost three of four since he returned and began Friday a half-game behind Boston in the American League East.

A healthy Rodriguez is essential for the Yankees’ long-term aspirations, and he has not been running well for nearly three weeks, since hurting his knee June 19 against the Cubs. He is mired in the second-longest homerless streak (85 at-bats) of his career, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, and Girardi acknowledged the injury could explain the drought. Cashman said he expected to know Rodriguez’s status Saturday, which the Yankees hope develops into a much better day — for them, for Rodriguez, for Jeter.

Nick Swisher might be sidelined through the All-Star break after injuring his left quadriceps Thursday while chasing Ben Zobrist’s first-inning triple. ... Brian Gordon, the converted outfielder who at age 32 made his first career start for the Yankees on June 16, was released so that he could sign with SK Wyverns in South Korea.
224 2011-07-09 “I feel their pain,” Mr. Marshall, 23 and slight, said of the band members. He went on to profess his innocence, saying that he was given a spiked marijuana cigarette that has stolen his memory of the night, and that he is the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy hatched by the 81st police Precinct, where he said he is “not liked.” He has been arrested there before, and pleaded guilty to robbery charges stemming from a mugging in 2008.

Oddly, he does not even live in the area. His residence is on East 72nd Street in the Georgetown neighborhood. But he loves Bed-Stuy, with an aunt and old friends nearby.

Coincidentally, he is also a musician — a rapper who, calling himself Blizz with a group called Stack Paper, appears on a song called “How You Livin’ ”. It is a gritty bit of courtship: “I want to know how you’re livin’/ Do you got any children?/ She said no/ I said, ‘O.K./ let’s hit the liquor store/ and get some rosé.’ ”

He is something of a curiosity among the staff members at Rikers. His grandmother, he said, used to be a corrections officer there, and she is well remembered. “They say, ‘Your grandmother would kill you if she saw you in here,’ ” he said. He shook his head. “This is not the place to be.”

I asked about the night in question.

Mr. Marshall said he began his Sunday, June 12, in church on nearby Quincy Street. “The pastor told me, ‘You have a blessing coming your way,’ ” he said. Mr. Marshall bought a small bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate, and made his way to Bainbridge, where he said he was approached by one of the tenants of the soon-to-be robbed apartment.

He said the tenant wanted to know if Mr. Marshall could get some cocaine or Ecstasy in time for a party that night. Mr. Marshall said he told them he doubted it. The victims have consistently given a different account: two of them were eating sandwiches outside when Mr. Marshall approached and mumbled something about Ecstasy — “just, like, talking to himself,” one musician, Ian Harris, 18, said — before drifting away.

Mr. Harris added a minor twist of his own when he conceded that he was recently arrested for possession of Ecstasy in Pennsylvania, a fact he had shared with Mr. Marshall during the conversation, but he said he never sought any drugs from him. The police have said the robbery did not appear to be drug-related.

After the sidewalk chat, Mr. Marshall said, he had the spiked marijuana: “I was smoking with people I shouldn’t have been smoking with.” He added that he was later told there were traces of hallucinogens in his system. The rest of his memory is hazy, but he said after midnight, he went to the musicians’ apartment for a party, to which he felt invited.

Next thing he knew, he was in a hospital. He said he believed the police stormed into the apartment, threw him out the window and beat the musicians, forcing them to later say that they had been robbed. The police emphatically adhere to the charges against Mr. Marshall, as do the victims. “That’s definitely not how it went down,” another victim, Joseph Davis, 21, said upon hearing the Marshall version.

Mr. Marshall, who suffered a dislocated shoulder and broken fingers, also said he was told he briefly died on the sidewalk. He said he was mounting a legal attack in the jail’s library, and he vowed to fight the charges at trial. He said he hoped to keep rapping and pursue a career in real estate.

What would he tell someone looking to buy the building he is accused of breaking into?

“I’d say the values on the block are rising,” he said.
225 2011-07-09 Feliciano López beat Mardy Fish on Friday, earning Spain a key singles victory over the United States in the Davis Cup quarterfinals in Austin, Tex. Playing as the No. 2 for Spain, López twice let Fish rally back from match point in the fifth set before winning, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (7), 8-6. Fish and López played for four hours, serving up 64 aces in a tense match in front of a raucous crowd loudly cheering for the Americans.

In the other quarterfinals, host Argentina took an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Kazakhstan; Gaël Monfils defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets to give France a 2-0 lead over host Germany; and Serbia led host Sweden, 2-0, despite the withdrawal of top-ranked Novak Djokovic because of a left knee injury.
226 2011-07-09 Yet that audience dwindled quickly after the first flight in 1981 as the missions turned routine, or at least seemed that way to the television executives who decided to stop showing live liftoffs. “It got blasé,” said Jay Barbree of NBC, who covered every manned space mission. “And then Challenger happened.”

CNN, then five years old, was the only television outlet to show the explosion that destroyed the Challenger as it happened in 1986. The image of the explosion remains dominant in the minds of Americans, asserted Mr. O’Brien, a former CNN correspondent. “In some respects, television brought to America the limits of technology in space, in the form of the shuttle,” he said.

That tragedy, and the break-up of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, led to brief spikes in television coverage of the NASA program and its subsequent flights into space, but the program faded from the imaginations of ordinary people — in part because there was little interest in it inside television news offices.

It was difficult over the years to “sell” space shuttle coverage, the longtime CNN correspondent John Zarrella said. He partly blamed NASA. The administration “has never done a very good job of promoting the space shuttle program or promoting itself,” he said Thursday in an interview.

He recalled visiting a NASA archive and seeing a stunning high-definition video segment of the shuttle’s solid rocket boosters being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. He said, “We went, ‘Wow, where’s all this stuff been?’ ”

Mr. Zarrella asked, “Would there have been more national support for the shuttle program, for NASA, and would there have been more public outcry about the end of the shuttle program if NASA had done a better job promoting itself? I don’t know the answer to that, but it’s worth asking.”

Mr. O’Brien, similarly, said he had “beaten my head against the wall for 20 years on this issue.” On top of science phobia among some newsroom bosses, he said, NASA was not savvy enough about giving access to astronauts.

“They,” he said, referring to NASA, “protected the astronauts way too much in an era when they should have been pushing them out” to the news media.

Still, countless Americans found themselves attuned at one time or another to NASA TV, a bare-bones cable channel with raw coverage of missions, or to the Twitter accounts for individual astronauts. The broadcasts, particularly early on, also motivated young people to pursue science and engineering positions in untold ways.

“The inspiration of dreams among aspiring engineers can’t be calculated in TV ratings,” Joshua King, a longtime shuttle-watcher, wrote in an e-mail. Mr. King, now the head of marketing and communications at Willis, the global insurance broker, said the coverage did not make him an engineer, but did make him “a person who tries to think like one.”
227 2011-07-09 Indonesian villagers who accused security forces employed by the Exxon Mobil Corporation of murder, torture and other atrocities have regained their right to sue the giant oil company in the United States.

A federal appeals court said on Friday that companies were not immune from liability under a 1789 law known as the Alien Tort Statute for “heinous conduct” committed by their agents in violation of human rights norms.

The 15 villagers contended in their lawsuit that family members were killed and that others were “beaten, burned, shocked with cattle prods, kicked and subjected to other forms of brutality and cruelty” amounting to torture in Indonesia’s Aceh province between 1999 and 2001, a period of civil unrest.

A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said Exxon Mobil should be forced to defend against such charges and sent the case back to the trial court.

Given that laws in civilized nations hold corporations responsible for lesser wrongs, “it would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in lawsuits brought for shockingly egregious violations of universally recognized principles of international law,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote for a 2-1 majority.

Friday’s decision reversed part of a ruling by the United States District Court in Washington.

It is also at odds with a landmark ruling last September by the Court of Appeals for the Second District in New York, raising the prospect that the case will reach the Supreme Court.

“The ruling basically says that corporations are not above the law,” said Jennifer Green, a University of Minnesota law professor and director of that school’s human rights litigation clinic, who submitted a brief on the plaintiffs’ behalf. “When corporations have knowledge that they are aiding and abetting human rights abuses, they can be held liable in a U.S. court.”

Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Tex., said it was reviewing Friday’s decision, calling the plaintiffs’ claims “baseless.”
228 2011-07-09 “In the coming hours,” said Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan’s information minister, “we will bear witness to the passage of history and the transformation of the map of Africa.”

John Voll, a professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University, said one reason Sudan has attracted so much attention over the years is that its internal conflicts were easily reduced by outsiders to Manichaean absolutes of oppressed Africans, many of them Christians, getting crushed by Arabs, “with echoes of the Crusades.”

Sudan — or soon, the two Sudans — is a vast, complex place with a dizzying amount of diversity. Before Saturday’s breakup, Sudan was the biggest country, geographically, in Africa. But it also has an unusually clear fault line, reinforced by the British colonizers, with the southern part mostly animist and Christian and the north mostly Muslim and long dominated by Arabs. A huge swamp, the Sudd, roughly separates the two, and in the 19th century, Western missionaries began to champion the southern Sudanese cause.

“Long before there was such a thing as secular human rights groups or a United Nations, missionaries rallied behind Sudan’s suffering,” said Eliza Griswold, author of “The Tenth Parallel,” a book on the line of latitude that roughly separates the Muslim and Christian worlds in Africa and Asia.

In 2001, Christian groups found a friend in the White House. The administration of George W. Bush pushed southern rebels, who had been fighting for self-determination for decades, and Sudan’s central government to sign a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005, which guaranteed the southerners the right to secede.

But this policy success — which Bush officials consider one of their top achievements, and may be one reason that Mr. Powell, Mr. Bush’s first secretary of state, was expected here on Saturday — was soon overshadowed by the crisis in Darfur. That conflict became the focus of one of the biggest humanitarian advocacy projects since the Live Aid benefit concert in 1985 raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Ethiopian famine victims.

Darfur, in western Sudan, exploded in 2003 after rebels attacked government forces and the government responded by arming Arab militias that burned villages, massacred civilians and drove more than two million people off their land.

Just about everyone in Darfur is Muslim, so looking at this internal conflict through the Crusades lens did not really apply. But an even more powerful way of presenting the violence emerged: many called it genocide.

“This gave the Darfur cause a distinctiveness that could gain real support,” Professor Voll said. “There were few other conflicts at that time that could so easily be called ‘genocidal,’ even though the conflicts in Congo were, and are, more destructive.”

Aid groups estimate that more than 5 million people have died in Congo as a result of the continuing conflict there, compared with around 300,000 who may have died of conflict-related causes in Darfur.

But the reference to “genocide” gave Darfur added urgency; once it was branded as such, there was a widespread sense that something had to be done. Movie stars soon became engrossed, including Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Mia Farrow (who has frequently traveled in Africa with American officials) and Mr. Clooney, who is now helping to pay for a satellite to monitor parts of Sudan.

There was a relationship between two seminal events in Sudan: the explosion of violence in Darfur and the end of the decades-long war in the south. Many Sudan analysts have said that Darfur — and all the attention it was getting — was the added pressure that finally pushed the Sudanese government, facing an international public relations disaster, to sign the treaty in 2005 that gave the southerners just about all they wanted.

This past January, Sudan’s division became a fait accompli when southerners voted in a referendum, by 98.8 percent, to secede. In the months leading to the vote, celebrities like Mr. Clooney urged the Obama administration to stay focused on Sudan.

“Would this have taken place without celebrities?” Mr. Walkley, the consul general, asked. “I think the celebrities had a lot to do with it.”

Celebrities, he said, “focus attention on a problem. They do it in a bumper sticker fashion, perhaps,” but “if you get millions of people sending blogs to the president, that will have an impact.”

But in Darfur, Western advocates may have complicated matters, too, some analysts contend, pushing a hard line against the government that has made the rebels there more intransigent and peace negotiations more difficult.

Mr. Clooney, who got malaria the last time he was in Sudan, was not expected for the festivities on Saturday. But religious groups will be represented. The only nongovernment employee in President Obama’s official delegation to Juba besides Mr. Powell is Ken Hackett, president of Catholic Relief Services.
229 2011-07-09 Data collected by the Airports Council International, a trade group, found that the nation’s smallest airports lost 10 to 15 percent of their scheduled flights from June 2006 through this June. Medium-size airports, meanwhile, lost 18 percent of their scheduled flights. But the biggest airports fared relatively better; their traffic dropped by only 2.3 percent over that same five-year period.

The top 50 airports now represent more than 80 percent of all passenger departures, while the 200 smallest airports account for less than 3 percent of passengers.

“How much air service do we really need in Kalamazoo, Mich., or Terre Haute, Ind., where manufacturing was once important?” asked William S. Swelbar, an industry expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Do we really need airports there today? Sick economies and high fuel are not going to attract airlines.”

And because fuel prices remain high, the airlines may accelerate their cuts in capacity by the end of the year once the busy summer travel period ends. In the five months through May, the latest period with available figures, 295 of 500 airports in the nation had fewer flights than in the same period last year. In 2010, 315 airports reported fewer flights than the previous year, compared with 414 in 2009.

Nearly 200 airports, most of them tiny and many in remote places, have lost air service entirely since 2008.

“Airlines have made a deliberate decision to forgo certain markets,” said Sunil Harman, who was recently appointed aviation director of the Tallahassee Regional Airport after 17 years as the director of planning for Miami International Airport. “Their new business model is leaving communities disenfranchised and disconnected from the global marketplace.”

Spencer Dickerson, the senior executive vice president of the American Association of Airport Executives, said airline cutbacks were a major challenge. “But in the end, the bottom line is the marketplace,” he said. “If the passengers aren’t there, it’s really hard for the airlines to justify the service.”

Smaller airports may continue to lose service in coming years, while the biggest hubs will become more crowded. The Federal Aviation Administration expects 550 million more passengers to be flying in 2031 than in 2010. It expects the biggest growth will be in the nation’s top hubs.

While there are some broad trends behind the cuts in air service, there are also a variety of explanations of why some airports experienced deeper cuts than others. Although Delta Air Lines continues to use Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport as a hub, departures dropped, falling to 200 flights a day in June from a peak of 670 five years ago. The airport now serves 55 cities, down from over 130, and has only one international destination, Paris.

Businesses based in the region, including Procter & Gamble and Toyota North America’s manufacturing operations, have felt the pinch. “It’s harder to get a seat on a flight,” said Ellen van der Horst, president of Cincinnati’s chamber of commerce.

The mergers among airlines in recent years have also contributed to the cutbacks. The drop in traffic in Cincinnati, for instance, came as Delta decided to focus on Detroit after its merger with Northwest Airlines.

Similarly, St. Louis suffered a major blow when American Airlines decided to shut down a hub operation it inherited when it bought the assets of T.W.A. Like most of the network carriers, American Airlines has decided to focus on its biggest hubs — including Dallas/Forth Worth and Miami International.

“The public takes air service for granted, but with the mergers, there aren’t that many airlines anymore, and there are fewer hubs,” said Justin Meyer, the manager of air service development for the Kansas City Aviation Department. “Just because you have a runway doesn’t mean you deserve service.”

That means airports must compete more fiercely than ever for service, Mr. Meyer said, and must be willing to offer incentives to the airlines, including lower gate or landing fees.

Roger Cohen, who heads the Regional Airline Association, said airports should offer carriers a compelling reason to fly into their communities. “It’s like dating, where attitude is everything,” Mr. Cohen said. “You want to show you’re interested in the relationship.”

Two years ago, the Port of Portland, Ore., which operates Portland International Airport, joined with local businesses to commit $5 million to offset losses that Delta might have on its flights to Tokyo so it would keep flying that route.

The financial help through the winter of 2009 persuaded Delta not to cancel the flight, said David Zielke, the general manager for air service development. Such international connections bring in about $100 million a year in economic investments to Portland businesses, he said.

The expansion of low-cost airlines has also hurt some airports, because the lower fares often make it worthwhile for passengers to drive longer distances. Since 1990, four of the top five airports with the biggest gains in traffic, including Baltimore/Washington, Salt Lake City and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are served by low-cost airlines, according to Mr. Swelbar of M.I.T.

Smaller airports may also fall victim to the phasing out of regional airplanes, like the MD-80s, which many airlines are grounding or permanently phasing out. These smaller jets, for which there are no current replacements, cannot pay for themselves when fuel prices are high because they have too few seats to be profitable.

“The regional 50-seat aircraft is on everyone’s deathwatch,” said Mr. Breen, of Cambridge Aviation Research. “We’ve reached a point where some types of aircraft that used to provide good service to smaller communities aren’t economically viable anymore.” One of those communities was Oxnard, whose small airport halfway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif., became a victim of the cutbacks last year when United Express discontinued service to the airport.

“Our selling point was that traffic from here to L.A.X. is horrible,” said Jorge Rubio, the airport’s manager. Now, residents of Ventura County face a grueling two-hour drive through traffic, instead of a 20-minute plane ride, to get to the Los Angeles airport.
230 2011-07-09 “We need to do something to give consumers more purchase options, and to give merchants greater access to more markets,” Mrs. Reding, a conservative from Luxembourg, said in an interview. “An optional E.U. contract law would have the effect of opening up the single market, giving traders and consumers the opportunity to transact in a secure environment.”

Mrs. Reding led the drive in 2007 to cap mobile phone roaming charges for consumers across the European Union. She said the new initiative was modeled in part on the Uniform Commercial Code used in the United States, the set of common rules that were initially published in 1952 and later adopted, with various amendments, by a majority of states in the 1960s.

Mrs. Reding said she developed the idea for the European proposal in part after consulting with experts at the American Law Institute in Philadelphia. “We could learn a lot from America about how to utilize and develop a single market,” she said.

But in Europe the proposal, which Mrs. Reding plans to present in October to the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, faces opposition from some lawmakers who question whether a new legal framework will cost more than it is worth. Associations representing contract lawyers and national consumer rights groups, whose livelihoods depend in part on advising on how to navigate the fragmented status quo, also say they are skeptical.

But the proposal gained momentum in May in a public consultation that attracted comments from 500 companies, governments and interest groups. Small-business groups, like the Federation of Small Businesses in Britain, spoke out in favor of the change, which they said would lower the costs of doing business and open new markets for small companies.

Mrs. Reding would need a majority of the Council of Ministers and the Parliament for the law to be enacted. If approved, it would be up to merchants to decide whether to offer it to consumers.

On June 8, the European Parliament, in a nonbinding vote, endorsed the concept. On July 7, the presidents of the 27 national supreme courts in the European Union sent a letter to Mrs. Reding in support of the approach. So did a German lawyers’ group and the multinational companies Audi, eBay and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

“The single market in Europe has been in place for many years, but only big businesses have been able to benefit, not small businesses, because they have the resources and legal staffs to navigate the fragmented landscape,” said Andrew Cave, a spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, which represents more than 200,000 British companies. “This would allow small businesses for the first time to take advantage of the E.U. single market.”

But even in Britain, one of the largest European exporters, the plan remains controversial. Mr. Cave said Britain’s conservative-liberal government coalition, along with governments in Denmark and the Czech Republic, criticized the proposal during the commission’s public consultation. Opposition in Britain, Mr. Cave said, is being led by the main lawyer’s group, the Law Society, and the Confederation of British Industry, which represents large businesses.

Discussions to resolve the impasse are taking place with the government and relevant interest groups behind the scenes, Mr. Cave said. A spokeswoman for the Law Society and the Confederation of British Industry said the group was still soliciting its members to take a position on the issue.

“We are hopeful that we will be able to convince the government of the benefits of this proposal to British small businesses and exporters,” Mr. Cave said.

Malcolm Harbour, the chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, one of several parliamentary panels that will consider the legislation this autumn, said he was skeptical the proposal would achieve its intended effect.

“My overall view about this is I am not sure that the cost-benefits of what are required to put this into effect are worth it,” said Mr. Harbour, a representative from Woking, England.

Mrs. Reding said her staff was preparing the details of the proposal, which would emphasize the voluntary nature of the regime and its benefits. All European Union consumers, for example, would gain the right to refunds and exchanges, not just repairs, in the case of defective merchandise, and also the right to cancel contracts when merchants did not deliver on time, among other things.
231 2011-07-09 There were persistent reports that the foreign visitors would try to create chaos and paralyze the airport, despite strenuous denials from the organizers of the campaign, who advocate nonviolence. They insisted that the foreigners wanted only to transit the airport and “go to Palestine.” (The West Bank has no airport of its own.)

By Thursday, the Interior Ministry had sent letters to foreign airlines with a list of 342 passengers it described as “pro-Palestinian radicals” planning to “arrive on commercial flights from abroad to disrupt the order and confront security forces at friction points.” Israel said people on the list would be refused entry, and it asked the airlines not to allow them to board flights, warning that if the listed passengers arrived at Ben-Gurion, they would be sent back on the same aircraft. Several airlines, including Lufthansa, complied with Israel’s request.

Several passengers at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris were barred from boarding a Lufthansa flight to Tel Aviv on Friday morning, and staged a protest. About 50 people were turned away, according to Agence France-Presse. There were reports of a similar disturbance at the Geneva airport.

“Like any other airline operating internationally, Lufthansa has to comply with the immigration laws and administrative decrees of the country we are flying to,” said Martin Riecken, a spokesman for the airline.

Such requests by national governments are not altogether uncommon, Mr. Riecken said, noting for example the United States’ no-fly list, which includes several thousand names.

Malev, the Hungarian airline, denied boarding to about 10 ticket holders in Paris on Friday. The decision to deny passengers the right to board does not indicate that “the airline likes or doesn’t like anyone,” said Marta Rona, a spokeswoman for the airline. Rather, she said, Israel had made it clear that the return of blacklisted passengers would be the responsibility of the airline.

“It’s our cost; it’s our responsibility; it’s our problem,” Ms. Rona said.

Yigal Palmor, the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said that the Israeli authorities had followed the activists’ plans and compiled the list of undesirables by tracking the Web sites and social networking of the organizations involved.

“We did not need the Mossad,” Mr. Palmor said, referring to Israel’s intelligence agency. “It was all out there in the open.”

At Ben-Gurion Airport, two American women were deported from Israel early Friday after flying in from Athens. In the afternoon, six Israeli left-wing demonstrators were detained for questioning after shouting pro-Palestinian slogans in the arrivals hall.

By early Saturday, 124 foreigners had been refused entry and were awaiting deportation,   a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry, Sabine Haddad, said. They had come in on six different flights and included Spanish, French, American, Belgian, Bulgarian and Dutch nationals, she said.

Israel’s Internal Security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, had branded the potential visitors as “hooligans.” Mr. Netanyahu said that every country has the right to block the entry of “provocateurs.”

Still, Israeli commentators and some politicians have described the Israeli preparations as excessive and bordering on hysterical.

“The state of Israel has taken leave of its senses,” wrote columnist Eitan Haber on the front page of the popular Yediot Aharonot newspaper on Thursday. “Instead of welcoming these loony visitors, permitting them to sing, whistle and even raise signs, the world is liable to see the ‘Zionist storm troopers’ in action once again.”

Brigitte Von Winterfeld, 71, from Germany, was one of a few foreigners who got to Bethlehem to join the campaign. She said she flew in on Tuesday, chose a “smiley” immigration officer at the passport control booths, and told him she was coming to visit friends. Ms. Von Winterfeld said she spent a while here last year with the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, a World Council of Churches organization that says it brings people from other countries to the West Bank to experience life under occupation.

The Palestinian organizers of the week’s program include well-known advocates of nonviolent protest like Sami Awad of the Bethlehem-based Holy Land Trust, and Mazin Qumsiyeh, a science professor at Bethlehem University. They said they were going ahead with the schedule as planned.

The itinerary includes visits to families in Palestinian refugee camps as well as demonstrations at various traditional Israeli-Palestinian flashpoints.
232 2011-07-09 The Atlantis is carrying 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station.

With storms rumbling around the area, forecasts had given just a 30 percent chance of favorable weather for the launching of the Atlantis. “We had a decent shot at it,” Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, said, explaining the decision early Friday to begin pumping more than half a million gallons of rocket fuel into the external fuel tank despite the uncertain forecast.

The rain stayed away, the clouds thinned, and the countdown, which encountered no significant setbacks, continued.

“Good luck, Godspeed and have a little fun up there,” Mr. Leinbach said to the crew after his team gave the go-ahead for the final few minutes of countdown.

The commander of Atlantis, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, thanked Mr. Leinbach and the launching team. Noting the end of the shuttle era, he added: “The shuttle is always going to be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through. We’re not ending the journey today, Mike, we’re completing a chapter in a journey that will never end.”

At 31 seconds before the scheduled liftoff, the countdown clock halted. An electronic signal indicated that the “beanie cap” that vents oxygen gas from the external fuel tank had failed to retract. But by looking at video images, mission controllers confirmed that the arm had indeed fully retracted.

At 11:29 a.m. — two and a half minutes later than scheduled — the engines of the Atlantis ignited to propel it to orbit with its crew of four: Capt. Ferguson; Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the ; Sandra H. Magnus; and Rex J. Walheim, a retired Air Force colonel.

After a minute, the shuttle, leaving behind a thick plume of smoke, disappeared into the clouds. Although the spacecraft was out of sight, the still-rising plume cast a shadow onto the clouds to mark its trajectory to space, and the Atlantis reached orbit in eight and a half minutes.

The astronauts will spend Saturday inspecting the heat shield and are to dock at the space station on Sunday. The mission is scheduled to last 12 days, with Atlantis returning to Earth on July 20, but NASA officials hope to stretch out the last flight one additional day.

At a post-launching news conference, NASA officials repeated assertions that the end of the space shuttle program does not mean the end of human spaceflight and that American astronauts will continue to travel to the International Space Station, albeit on Russian rockets for at least several years.

“You can’t do something else, you can’t do something better, unless you go through change,” said Robert D. Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center.

Once the Atlantis had reached orbit and their job was done, members of the launching team lingered in the control room, Mr. Leinbach said. “It seemed we didn’t want to leave,” he said. “It was like the end of a party, and you just don’t want to go. You just want to hang around a little bit longer and relish our friends and what we’ve accomplished.”
233 2011-07-09 PARIS — The Paris prosecutor’s office on Friday opened a preliminary investigation into accusations that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who is accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel housekeeper, tried to rape a French journalist during an interview in 2003, an official at the prosecutor’s office said.

The journalist, Tristane Banon, 32, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted her during an interview for a book she was writing at the time. Her lawyer, David Koubbi, said Tuesday that he had mailed a criminal complaint to the prosecutor’s office.

The opening of an investigation into the accusation against Mr. Strauss-Kahn in France came as the case against him in the United States appeared to weaken last week. Mr. Strauss-Kahn was released from house arrest on July 1 after prosecutors in New York said there were inconsistencies in accounts given by the housekeeper that undermined her credibility.

In France, the preliminary investigation against Mr. Strauss-Kahn “might take time,” the official in Paris said, “in order to try to reach the truth.” The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, did not predict whether it would result in formal charges.

Mr. Koubbi said in an interview this week in the magazine L’Express that he and Ms. Banon had agreed in mid-June to file a criminal complaint but that they had “taken the necessary time because we didn’t want to become an instrument of American justice.".

Ms. Banon said that it had taken her eight years to file a complaint because “for every woman who finds herself in this case, it is very hard.”

238 2011-07-10 In turn, Mr. Bloomberg supported the Independence Party’s goal of nonpartisan municipal elections and gave the party more than $650,000 of his own money. His administration arranged millions of dollars in bond financing in 2002 and 2006 for a building for Mr. Newman’s nonprofit All Stars Project, which uses the performing arts to help low-income children.

Mr. Newman began his climb to influence in New York in the 1960s, when, from his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, he formed a Marxist collective called “If ... Then.” Its members, many of them self-professed anarchists, collected money on the streets for the group. Most participated in Mr. Newman’s newly articulated “social therapy,” which encouraged patients to change themselves by seeking to change society. He encouraged collective members to sleep with one another, an activity he called “friendosexuality.” The collective published newspapers and started a dental clinic.

“It’s probably fair to say I was the dominant leader,” Mr. Newman said in an interview with The New York Observer in 1999. “I hope I wasn’t an authoritarian oppressor, but I think that’s probably accurate to say that.”

His detractors, however, said his “collective” amounted to a cult. Chip Berlet, a senior analyst with Political Research Associates, which studies unorthodox political groups, called Mr. Newman “a master at creating a myth of importance.”

Frederick Delano Newman was born in the Bronx on June 17, 1935, and grew up there. His mother chose the same middle name as that of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a hero of hers. After his father died when young Fred was 9, his mother raised her five children alone, supported by welfare checks, the rent from rooms in her house, near Yankee Stadium, and the fees she earned running poker games.

Mr. Newman hated school but tested well enough to be admitted to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. He worked as a toolmaker to help support his family. At 19, he joined the Army and served in Korea. He graduated from the City College of New York and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford in 1962.

He was twice married and divorced. He is survived by his son, Donald; his daughter, Elizabeth Newman; and by Gabrielle L. Kurlander and Jacqueline Salit, his life partners in what Ms. Salit described as an “unconventional family of choice.” He died of renal failure, his spokeswoman, Christina DiChiara, said.

Mr. Newman taught at City College but was fired after giving male students A’s to help them avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam. Other colleges hired him but fired him for the same reason. A job as a drug counselor led to his therapy career.

After forming his Upper West Side collective, Mr. Newman, in 1974, allied his group with Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., originally a leftist leader who veered to right-wing conspiracy theories and ran for president eight times from the political fringe. Tensions between the two prompted Mr. Newman to break the alliance after less than a year, however. He then formed the International Workers Party from what he called his core collective, with a mission to advance minority rights and a leftist agenda.

The party was dissolved at the end of the 1970s. Mr. Newman then founded the New Alliance Party as a vehicle for moving beyond a narrow leftist spectrum. Around the same time, he met Ms. Fulani, a graduate student who attended one of his clinics and joined the collective. Mr. Newman helped mold her into a political professional who for many years was the face of his political ventures.

“She is one of my life’s proudest accomplishments,” he told New York Newsday in 1992.

In 1988, as her campaign manager, he helped Ms. Fulani get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states, something no black candidate or woman had done. She received more than 200,000 votes. In 1992, Ms. Fulani ran again, and raised more than $2 million from private donors.

In 1991, the New Alliance Party gave strong support to Mr. Sharpton, then a community advocate, at a time when he was struggling for broader political recognition. It provided Mr. Sharpton with income, public relations help and up to half the participants in his demonstrations, often protesting attacks against blacks.

In the early 1990s, Mr. Newman began a campaign to encourage more independent voices in politics, almost regardless of ideology. These included Mr. Perot, Ralph Nader and even the conservative stalwart Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Newman supported a succession of reform parties, ultimately capturing control of the New York City branch of the Independence Party.

As late as 2005, Mr. Newman wrote that he remained a Marxist, albeit what he called a postmodern one. His final cause was to end the two-party system, which he believed stifled real choice. He wanted primary elections to be open to all parties, and to have all candidates run against one another. The top two would vie in a general election.

That proposal prompted a question from Mr. Bloomberg one day in 2001 when the future mayor was seeking Mr. Newman’s support, Ms. Salit recalled. Mr. Bloomberg asked him if he would be putting himself out of business if he were to give up the ballot line he had used so effectively.

“We’re an anti-party party,” Mr. Newman answered. “We want to be put out of business.”
239 2011-07-10 Many investors, of course, lost big in the financial crisis. But few lost more publicly than Mr. MacFarlane. A recent Bloomberg headline reminded everyone that, thanks to him, “Arizona Land Sells for 8% of Price CalPERS Group Paid at Peak.” Mr. MacFarlane said he resigned his CalPERS account, and The Wall Street Journal heralded the news with “CalPERS Cleans House, Finally.” That $1 billion Mr. MacFarlane lost will haunt the state for years, since taxpayers are responsible for CalPERS’s liabilities.

But now Mr. MacFarlane is mounting a comeback, announcing two developments in recent weeks. The rental-apartment and small retail projects — one at what is now a pit at the corner of Market and Octavia, the other involving an old foam-cup factory in Corte Madera — are quite a comedown from glamorous projects of yore like the Time Warner Center in New York.

Some might take Mr. MacFarlane’s ability to get even small deals done as a sad indicator of a financial industry culture in which failure brings few consequences. But if this 60-year-old liver-transplant survivor can pick himself up and get back in the game, then perhaps it’s a sign of something more hopeful — that if you have the smarts and the moxie, you can pick yourself up and start afresh.

Sitting in his office in SoMa, framed by celebrity-friend photos and a commanding view of the Bay Bridge, Mr. MacFarlane doesn’t seem to have put the past entirely behind him. The once-formidable investor has a haunted look about him, his broad, reflexive salesman’s smile never quite making it to his eyes.

Spinning gamely, Mr. MacFarlane said he was simply returning to the strategies that brought him initial success decades ago.

“The market is moving back to what we do,” he said, adding that while his firm was “always well-known for our biggest investments, we have always done this range of deals.”

Mr. MacFarlane raised his current $211 million investment fund in 2009, from three unidentified European institutions, and Goldman Sachs now owns 20 percent of the firm. The two new projects will cost about $123 million.

Nori Gerardo Lietz, chief strategist for private real estate at the Partners Group, an investment-management firm, gives Mr. MacFarlane considerable credit for forging on. A self-made man, Mr. MacFarlane grew up poor in Middletown, Ohio, made it to a Presbyterian boarding school in Arizona and later earned an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a law degree from U.C.L.A.

“Victor is an interesting, complicated person,” Ms. Lietz said. “The real estate business in general is very clearly a white man’s business.  And so, he had to maneuver as an African-American man in that context, which certainly wasn’t easy. Without a doubt he had to build a business with considerable headwinds against him.”

In that vein, Mr. MacFarlane explained that it was fine with him, at this point, to be dealing in much smaller deals.

In today’s post-crash reality, “much more important is your sphere of influence,” rather than huge dollar figures attached to big developments, he said. “That’s usually enough to get by.”
240 2011-07-10 In the most important of those cases — known as Timothy J — a Sacramento public defender, Arthur Bowie, successfully argued that children could be found incompetent based merely on their level of developmental maturity. The finding allowed the question of competency to come into play even in the absence of mental health problems or developmental disabilities.

“Why do we say a child can’t have a drink at 10 because he’s not thinking it through, but he can walk into a courtroom and understand what’s going on?” Mr. Bowie said in an interview.

Mr. Bowie’s cases informed state legislation in 2010 that cemented guidelines for youth competency and defined the qualifications for mental health experts who testify in fitness hearings. But the new law did little to clarify how minors found incompetent should be treated.

Some argue that the Timothy J case has made it easier for defense lawyers to get minors released and cases dismissed.

“I know people are using it as a litigation strategy, and that’s not a good thing,” said George Beckwith, a private lawyer who defends minors in San Francisco. “I don’t believe it’s rampant but I do believe it exists.”

“This is something that judges and D.A.’s concoct in their sleep at night, because it’s not true,” he said. “They’re afraid the case is going to get dragged out, the case is going to go stale, especially if they have a good case.”

The San Francisco Juvenile Justice Center — which includes delinquency courts, district attorneys and public defenders — formed a task force last fall to address the competency issue. The group discovered that San Francisco had little information, few standards for evaluating competency and even fewer protocols for helping minors once competency was questioned.

“We don’t have any good data,” said Sue Burrell, a lawyer for the Youth Law Center in San Francisco. “We don’t know if the incompetent kids are all rapists and murderers, but I suspect that most of them are low-level or midlevel kids that just need services.”

Last fall, Garry Bieringer, a detention alternative coordinator for the Department of Juvenile Probation, began counting competency cases in San Francisco. There were 10 between 2007 and 2009, he said. For 2010, he found 30 cases. He said 2011 was on track to reach 30 cases or more.

Patrick Mahoney, a San Francisco Juvenile Court judge, said competency had become a national issue.

“What is happening is not unique to San Francisco,” he said. “This issue is being raised in every jurisdiction where I’ve had the opportunity to speak with judges.”

Last fall, the task force looked at experts who routinely provided competency evaluations. At least one psychologist was dismissed after it was determined that the doctor had found defendants incompetent in most, if not all, cases. The judges assembled a new panel of psychologists amid suspicions that defense lawyers could count on certain experts to find clients incompetent.

Rani Singh, an assistant district attorney who prosecuted the middle school rape case, said the lawyer who questioned his client’s competency chose an expert outside the panel, who determined the boy was incompetent. Proceedings were suspended and Ms. Singh had him evaluated by a psychologist on the panel, who said the minor was fit to attend court.

Alexis Goldner, a San Francisco police inspector, interrogated the boy in April 2010 and said he confessed to raping his classmate. “He said that they held her down,” Ms. Goldner said. “He still knew the difference between right and wrong. I don’t understand why he wouldn’t be held accountable.”

It appeared that Judge Julie Tang would have to preside over a “battle of the experts,” to determine the boy’s competency. But on Friday, an agreement was reached in which the boy was found competent and he pled to a lesser charge of sexual battery.

When competency is questioned, minors are supposed to undergo a treatment plan outlined by a psychologist. As with adults, the goal is to render them competent to face a judge. But providing services involves wrangling multiple agencies and defying harsh budget realities.

“There are individual cases where things have gone well because everybody is sitting around the table and the kid has really high needs, so mountains are moved,” said Dr. Emily Gerber, a psychologist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, who connects youth in the justice system with support services. “But I think that’s the exception.”

Ms. Lee of the public defender’s office said the lawyers working for her were trained to connect clients with counseling and other support, regardless of court rulings, but doing so presented steep challenges.

“With competence, it’s very difficult to remediate and provide restorative services because they don’t exist,” she said. “Most of these youth don’t qualify for the funding streams and that’s a quandary for the system, and that’s when these kids languish in custody.”

Mr. Beckwith handled a case last year that involved a 12-year-old boy who was arrested for robbery twice in seven months. Both times the boy was released because of incompetence. Despite a court-ordered treatment plan, Mr. Beckwith said, most of the remediation services never arrived. When the boy was arrested a third time last December, the judge placed him in juvenile hall, where he has been for more than six months.

After seeing that the boy had not received adequate counseling while incarcerated, Mr. Beckwith said he would never question competency again.

“I don’t care if the client is standing there blubbering, because they lock them up, proceedings are suspended, and they don’t get services,” he said. “You fight like hell to get your kid into some kind of a program but for the average kid it’s not going to happen.”

Mr. Mahoney said there was a “disconnect” between the court’s best intentions and achievable treatment goals.

“The treatment plans can be really difficult to execute,” he added. “They’re often unrealistic in terms of the real world.”
241 2011-07-10 SHANGHAI — In the latest sign that China is still struggling to tame inflation, the government said Saturday that the consumer price index rose by 6.4 percent in June, the highest rate in three years.

Although analysts were expecting inflation to peak for the year in June, the figures are troubling, particularly because food prices rose 14.4 percent from a year ago, up from 11.7 percent in May, suggesting that Beijing may have a difficult time reining in rising prices.

The price of pork — a major food staple in China — was up 57 percent in June from the level a year earlier, making it the biggest contributor to inflationary pressure. Beijing is trying to slow growth in what is now the world’s second largest economy in the hopes of preventing inflation and high property prices from undermining an economy that has grown strongly over the last two years.

A $586 billion government stimulus package in 2009 and aggressive lending by state-owned banks, much of it aimed at investments in real estate construction and government infrastructure projects, have driven the economy during the last two years. But now, to moderate that growth, Beijing is trying to tighten credit by restraining bank lending and by raising interest rates.

On Thursday, China’s Central Bank raised interest rates for the fifth time since October. And over the last few months there are signs that manufacturing and economic growth have moderated. Last month, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said the government had succeeded in one of its chief policy goals this year: bringing inflation under control. But he also conceded that the government might not meet its inflation target of 4 percent this year.

Indeed, rising wages among migrant workers, higher prices for food and gasoline, as well as droughts and flooding in key agricultural regions have all contributed to inflation this year. Many analysts say that China will succeed in its efforts to battle inflation and that the economy will ease but not face a difficult hard landing later this year. But with severe power shortages expected this summer and few signs of food prices easing, it’s unclear whether Beijing will be successful.
242 2011-07-10 Alabama, 1963: The Heart of Civil Rights in America
243 2011-07-10 “You could do a very efficient portfolio with four to eight E.T.F.’s,” perhaps one of them in commodities, said Mr. Justice, who leads a staff of more than 15 analysts who study them.

The holdings of most exchange-traded funds closely replicate stock or bond indexes, supplying the diversification essential to portfolio well-being. And although their creation is somewhat technical, E.T.F.’s act like mutual funds except that they can be bought and sold at whatever prices prevail throughout the trading day, rather than at a single price calculated by a fund sponsor at the close.

“They allow the investor or portfolio manager to home in and get the specific exposure they want,” said Joanne Welker, vice president and manager of advisory services at Benjamin F. Edwards & Company, a broker based in St. Louis. “And the ability to trade intraday, that’s attractive to many people.”

That feature has prompted some criticism that exchange-traded funds have led some investors astray by inducing frantic, self-defeating trading. But these funds can also be as suitable as mutual funds for long-term investors.

“Just consider them leaner, meaner cousins of corresponding mutual funds,” said Jerry A. Miccolis, chief investment officer at Brinton Eaton Wealth Advisors in Madison, N.J.

If the funds track broad indexes, E.T.F.’s are appropriate not only for the long term, but also as good substitutes for individually chosen securities, Mr. Miccolis said.

“Even a very sophisticated investor can have a world-class portfolio with nothing in it but E.T.F.’s and E.T.N.’s,” he said, referring to exchange-traded notes, a variation that involves notes, backed by bank underwriters, that are also designed to track underlying market indexes.

The remarkable growth in E.T.F.’s — there are now almost 1,300 — has occurred even though they haven’t meaningfully penetrated employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, where millions of workers stash their retirement savings. Less than $10 billion is invested in retirement E.T.F.’s, even though BlackRock, the biggest E.T.F. sponsor, has sought to tap this market for four years. These plans are often invested in actively managed mutual funds that levy substantial fees.

In March, the Charles Schwab Corporation announced that it planned to offer retirement plans composed entirely of E.T.F.’s, though industry specialists said it faced several hurdles — including how to compete with established distribution channels dominated by the likes of Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group.

E.T.F.’s tend to be more tax-efficient than mutual funds — and even more efficient than index funds that also do little trading. Mutual funds must often sell securities to pay off investors redeeming shares, thereby producing capital gains and a resulting tax liability.

“You may be at the mercy of other shareholders,” Ms. Welker said.

And the huge variety of exchange-traded funds makes it easier to harvest losses for tax purposes without the risk of violating the wash-sale rule, which prohibits taxpayers from taking a tax loss on a sale if a substantially identical issue is purchased within 30 days. Any tax edge held by these funds becomes irrelevant in 401(k) plans, however, because investments in these accounts are already sheltered from taxes.

Another advantage is that E.T.F.’s are fairly transparent, allowing investors to learn within days of changes in portfolios, far quicker than the quarterly or semiannual disclosures available to investors in mutual funds.

What’s more, E.T.F.’s make it easy to make short sales, betting on market declines in a way that is denied to mutual fund investors, except for those in a handful of bear-market funds. E.T.F.’s accounted for 4 of the top 12 issues in last month’s short-interest tally by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The SPDR S.&P. 500 fund was atop the list; the other three were iShares Russell 2000 Index, Financial Select Sector SPDR and SPDR S.&P. Retail.

Still, specialists caution that the proliferation of E.T.F.’s has brought versions for ever-narrower niches of the stock, bond and commodities markets, as well as in leveraged vehicles and inverse funds, which are intended to have the opposite return of their benchmark index.

Some, in fact, are actively managed or, in the case of PowerShares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000, indexed to a list of stocks allocated by such fundamentals as cash flow instead of by traditional market capitalization.

Actively managed E.T.F.’s, however, have been slow to catch on, perhaps suffering from the same disenchantment with portfolio managers who failed to protect investors from the grim stock swoon of 2007 and 2008.

CRITICS of E.T.F.’s, including John C. Bogle, founder of the index-oriented Vanguard group of funds, contend that besides tempting people to overtrade, the E.T.F. product line has become much too narrowly focused. A fund that tracks, say, small-capitalization real estate or a slice of an emerging market is likely to be more volatile — and more expensive — than one tracking a broad domestic index. Examples of funds that focus on specific niches are the IQ U.S. Real Estate Small Cap fund, the Guggenheim Timber fund and PowerShares Water Resources.

“The trends are disturbing,” Mr. Miccolis said, and dangerous to the unwary. “The average investor shouldn’t go any more granular than industry sectors,” he said, such as energy or health care or the eight other main stock categories used by Standard & Poor’s: materials, industrials, communications, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, finance, technology and utilities.

Some E.T.F.’s are so specialized that they ultimately fail to be viable, like a fund tied to the Islamic Shariah law (the fund closed last October) and the four Faith-Shares E.T.F.’s that started in December 2009 and are linked to Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist values. (They are to stop trading on Friday.) Part of the Faith-Shares’ problem may have been relatively hefty expense ratios of 0.87 percent, in contrast to the generally very low costs of nearly all large, broader E.T.F.’s.

It is possible, moreover, for niche E.T.F.’s to deviate significantly from the indexes or commodities they track, as happened this year with the biggest gold E.T.F., the bullion-backed SPDR Gold Shares.

Another risk is that an E.T.F. investor with standing orders can suffer disastrously from a sudden market dive, as occurred in the so-called “flash crash” in May 2010.

All in all, Mr. Justice at Morningstar said, E.T.F.’s have a strong claim for investors’ attention, even as he criticized those commentators who have begun to dismiss their close relatives, mutual funds, as relics. “We love E.T.F.’s but we love mutual funds, too,” he wrote. “These products are more similar than they are different — and neither is right for every situation.”
244 2011-07-10 According to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows, investors added more than $7 billion to inflation-protected bond funds in the first half of this year, roughly equaling the amount for all of 2010.

The big swings in inflation expectations have been most evident in the so-called break-even rate — which is the difference between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year TIPS and reflects trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt. That rate climbed to a high of 2.67 percent in April, just as crude oil prices peaked at around $114 a barrel, from 1.5 percent last August.

But in May, as signs of an economic slowdown appeared and investors began to anticipate an end to the Fed’s bond-buying spree, inflation expectations collapsed. As measured by the break-even rate, expectations for consumer price inflation dropped to 2.14 and the TIPS market stumbled.

TIPS funds returned just 0.3 percent in May, before rebounding in June as worries eased about Greek debt and a sustained slowdown in the United States economy.

For the second quarter, inflation-linked bond funds returned about 3.1 percent according to Morningstar, compared with 3.6 percent for funds that invest in regular long-term government bonds.

Over longer periods, however, TIPS have sometimes outpaced the returns of regular Treasury funds. Over the last five years, inflation-linked bond funds have returned 6.36 percent, annualized, compared with 6.04 percent for intermediate government debt funds and 7.4 percent for long-term government bond funds.

“The TIPS market clearly got a bit exuberant going into the spring,” said Daniel O. Shackelford, manager of the $387 million T. Rowe Price Inflation Protected Bond fund. “Over the last several weeks, the market has made an adjustment to more modest inflation expectations,” he said.

The T. Rowe Price TIPS fund returned 3.3 percent in the quarter, after gains of 6.29 percent in 2010 and 10.43 percent in 2009.

DESPITE the recent adjustment, analysts say TIPS remain expensive, particularly those with shorter maturities. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, and TIPS maturing in five years, for example, yielded a negative 0.37 percent at the end of the second quarter. That compared with a 1.76 percent yield on a regular five-year Treasury note. Ten-year TIPS yielded 0.69 percent, compared with 3.16 percent for noninflation-linked 10-year Treasury debt.

Managers of TIPS funds say the inflation protection offered by TIPS makes sense for a portion of a portfolio.

“If you buy a two-year Treasury note yielding 40 basis points while inflation is running at 2 percent, that is wealth destruction,” Mr. Shackelford said. “TIPS may not be a formula for building wealth; they will do what they were constructed to do, which is to compensate you for increases in consumer prices.”

Some money managers say they are shifting into the longer-term end of the TIPS market, where yields for 30-year maturities were 1.7 percent as of the end of June.

“We’ve been moving out of the intermediate sector of TIPS and buying the long end,” said Martin Hegarty, co-head of global inflation-linked portfolios at BlackRock, the New York-based money manager, which oversees $3.6 trillion in assets. Mr. Hegarty said purchases of intermediate-term TIPS, those of 5 to 10 years, by foreign central banks had helped to depress yields in that sector.

The $4 billion BlackRock Inflation Protected Bond fund gained 2.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.66 percent this year through June.

Still, analysts said the current pricing of TIPS should raise at least one red flag. TIPS may be inflation-protected and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, but they are far from being risk-free.

“If the Fed were to make any pre-emptive move against inflation, TIPS could get killed,” said Mr. Johnson at Morningstar. “People tend to think TIPS have no risk, but if you sell them before maturity, or if you own a fund that it weighted with longer-term maturities, they can have substantial risk.”

Fund managers say that while these problems are real, TIPS may still be useful.

“Investors certainly should not judge TIPS by taking a backward view of how they have performed,” said John W. Hollyer, a manager of the $35 billion Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund, which returned 3.4 percent in the second quarter. “They are not a risk-free asset because they have a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates. But if inflation makes a sudden move upward, you will be compensated, and that’s important.”
245 2011-07-10 Emerging markets tend to be more volatile than developed ones, and big declines can eat big gains. When news is good, these markets can soar, as China’s did in 2007, when the MSCI Broad China Index returned nearly 90 percent. But when the news is bad, they can plunge, as China’s market did the next year, when the index fell more than 50 percent. (If you had invested $1,000 in the index in that period, your money would have grown to $1,900, before expenses, by the end of the first year but would have shrunk to $950, before expenses, by the end of the second.)

Another reason that stock gains don’t necessarily track economic growth is that the goals of local companies can diverge, for extended periods, from those of fund investors. In China, as in many emerging markets, enterprises may plow money into projects aimed at expanding market share, regardless of the impact on their share prices. “Companies aren’t interested in rewarding minority investors,“ said Arthur R. Kroeber, managing director of GK Dragonomics in Beijing. “They’re interested in scaling up.“

On top of that, Chinese corporate governance can be lax, and accounting opaque. In searching for quality companies with good business models, said Nicholas Yeo, manager of the Aberdeen China Opportunities fund, “we do a lot of site visits to make sure the entrepreneur’s interests are aligned with the listed company.”

Investors in China funds face risks beyond poor returns. They can have difficulty even understanding what they are buying, as different funds define “China” differently. Some, like Mr. Yeo’s fund and the Guinness Atkinson China and Hong Kong fund, keep much of their shareholders’ money in companies listed in Hong Kong. Others also buy Taiwanese companies or multinationals with hefty Chinese operations. “Not all China funds are the same,” said William S. Rocco, a Morningstar fund analyst.

BESIDES understanding what you are getting with a China fund, you also should examine whether you really need one, Mr. Rocco said. “You’re not going to miss China’s growth if you have a well-balanced portfolio,” he said. Many international and emerging-markets funds include Chinese stocks, and American and European multinationals are increasingly generating profits in China, he said.

Jesper O. Madsen, manager of the Matthews China Dividend fund, counsels caution. “Anybody who looks at China needs to ask himself why he’s there,” Mr. Madsen said. Too often, retail investors pile into emerging countries after stock run-ups, losing sight of whether a particular market looks cheap or expensive based on its average price-to-earnings ratio. “If you overpay,” he added, “you won’t see good returns.”

For some people, investing isn’t just a way to increase wealth, but also a hobby. Even if they have a well-rounded portfolio, they want to make small bets on markets or sectors that they think will thrive.

If you are one of these, should recent news of Chinese inflation, which hit 5.5 percent in May, and the possibility of real estate bubbles in Beijing and Shanghai daunt you?

Several China-fund managers say the risks are real — but tolerable.

“From 2000 to 2010, when China really began to industrialize, there was surplus labor and a cycle of infrastructure investment that drove a lot of productivity growth,” said Eric A. Brock, co-manager of the ALPS Clough China fund. “Inflation over that period was shockingly low. Today is different. You still have the productivity story, but the supply of labor has tightened. It wouldn’t surprise us if inflation is 3 to 5 percent a year going forward, but that’s not a problem in the context of 8 to 10 percent annual growth.”

If inflation began to accelerate, Mr. Brock said he would worry. But so far, he said, the government has kept prices mostly in check by raising bank reserve requirements and interest rates. Last week, the central bank raised short-term rates for the third time this year. Mr. Brock and his co-manager, Francoise Vappereau, are betting that rising wages will propel the growth of China’s consumer sector. As the Chinese earn more money, opportunities arise for companies like the furniture maker Man Wah Holdings, which Mr. Brock called “the La-Z-Boy of China.” “People are hitting an income level where demand for Man Wah’s product can rise,” he said.

Frederick Jiang, manager of the Ivy Pacific Opportunities fund, said that while real estate values in Beijing and Shanghai have shot up, he was more worried about inflation than about bubbles in these markets. “If you compare prices in Shanghai and Beijing relative to the average income there, there’s a bubble,” he said. “But relative to Mumbai or Moscow, they’re still cheap.”

The Chinese government is making a big push to build affordable homes, committing to start 10 million units in 2011 alone. As a result, Mr. Jiang, who has invested about a third of his investors’ money in China, holds shares in cement suppliers like China National Building Material and China Resources Cement Holdings.

And Louis So, co-chief investment officer of Value Partners, a Hong Kong hedge fund manager, says his company is investing in private property developers like China Vanke.

“We think they’re dirt cheap at the moment,” he said. He called his company’s venture into the property sector a contrarian move, and two recent actions by ratings agencies suggest that his characterization may be correct.

Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s lowered their outlooks for Chinese developers to negative, from stable. And S.& P. predicted that Chinese real estate prices were likely to fall 10 percent over the next year, possibly by as much as 30 percent. It said government efforts to raise interest rates were likely to curb credit and reduce property sales.
246 2011-07-10 ROME — A Milan appeals court on Saturday ordered one of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s family holding companies to pay $798 million to a rival group as compensation for its corrupt activities in a takeover battle, further weakening the prime minister.

The court upheld a ruling that fined Mr. Berlusconi’s Fininivest holding company for bribing a judge during the group’s takeover of the Mondadori publishing company in the 1990s, but it reduced by about one-fourth the amount of the damages.

In a statement, Fininvest’s chairwoman, who is also the prime minister’s eldest daughter, Marina Berlusconi, said the company would appeal to Italy’s highest appeals court. She called the ruling “completely unjust” and a “violent aggression” against her father.

The political climate in Italy is particularly tense, with concerns over the country’s financial health rising fast. Mr. Berlusconi’s legal woes have been part of the debate over the national budget and of spirited infighting within his center-right coalition.

After a public outcry last week, Mr. Berlusconi removed a measure, which had been buried in Italy’s austerity bill, to allow companies to temporarily avoid paying heavy fines until all court appeals are exhausted.

The measure — which officials of Mr. Berlusconi’s People of Liberty Party says it will now try to submit as a stand-alone bill in the Senate — was widely seen as a sign that Mr. Berlusconi was more focused on his personal legal battles than on Italy’s economic health. Both have seemed to take a turn for the worse in recent days.
247 2011-07-10 AUDIS with underperforming heaters and Ford pickups with clunking driveshafts are among the mechanical ailments covered in recent technical service bulletins.

The bulletins, which are compiled by alldatapro.com, offer automakers’ insights into some recurring problems with various models. The bulletins, known as T.S.B.’s, are not recalls; they are information provided by manufacturers to dealers’ service departments and mechanics.

Unless otherwise noted, the carmakers do not offer payment assistance for these repairs beyond normal warranty coverage. Alldata.com sells a more comprehensive version of the bulletins to consumers. Here are a few recent examples:

ACURA Engines of 2004-8 TL models may knock or vibrate while driving. In T.S.B. 11-007 issued on May 20, Acura said the front engine mount in some TLs might crack or tear because of high temperatures under the hood. Replacing the engine mount should stop the shaking.

AUDI Some Q7s may not deliver enough heat to passengers while idling. In T.S.B. 191124 issued on May 19, Audi said the problem in 2011 Q7 3.0 TFSI models was caused by an incorrect ventilation hose to the coolant reservoir or an incorrectly positioned check valve in the ventilation hose. Replacing the hose and ensuring that the check valve is in the right spot should warm the Q7’s cabin.

FORD F-150 Raptor pickups may clunk or slip when starting or stopping. In T.S.B. 11-5-7 issued on May 10, Ford said the noise, heard in some 2011 Raptors, came from the driveshaft. Replacing the driveshaft assembly is the cure.

The bride’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom’s.
251 2011-07-10 Half the delight of eating at Gianluca Bisol’s new restaurant, Venissa, is the journey there. It’s a 30-minute boat ride northeast of Venice, and along the way your boat might cut through thin scraps of morning fog still stuck to the water, or chug past a vast brick ruin on an uninhabited vine-choked island.

But your ultimate port of call is the small, sparsely populated island of Mazzorbo, where a pile of unremarkable homes and an ancient walled vineyard, the Venissa Estate, are almost entirely overlooked by even some of the most ambitious tourists. Mr. Bisol spent the last decade restoring the estate, which is designated as an Italian Natural Environment Park; he opened the restaurant in 2010.

But his greatest act of reclamation may be his restoration of the Dorona grape, a Venetian varietal that ceased to be cultivated in the lagoon 600 years ago. Today it grows in perfectly trained rows inside the estate’s medieval walls.

“The lagoon is my second home by the sea,” said Mr. Bisol, a descendant of an illustrious family of vintners who have been making wines and prosecco in the Italian province of Treviso since 1542. “It’s important to us to reclaim arable land, conserve history and create employment opportunities for people here.”

At the helm of Venissa’s kitchen is Paola Budel, who relies on all things local: produce from the estate’s vast vegetable gardens; lagoon fish like eels, mullet and crabs stocked in their nearby fish farm; and oysters culled from beds on the neighboring beach. “We pay homage to cuisine from the lagoon and the Veneto,” Mr. Bisol said. “We get honey from the nearby Island of Sant’Erasmo and langoustines and salicornia seaweed right from the lagoon.”

This emphasis is immediately evident on the menu. During a recent lunch, I had an unctuous starter of crumb-crusted, pan-fried lagoon eel with a cream and broccoli sauce, then a steaming bowl of nutty kamut spaghetti with fresh lagoon anchovies and sautéed wild spring onions, foraged that morning. The main course was a thin veal cutlet, breaded and pan-fried until golden, with a tangy artichoke cream.
252 2011-07-10 The losses were immense — at least three-quarters of a million soldiers killed in battle or lost through illness and disease, two-thirds of them Russian. The French lost around 100,000 men, the British a small fraction of that number, about 20,000, because they sent far fewer troops (98,000 British soldiers and sailors were involved in the Crimea compared to 310,000 French). But even so, for a small agricultural community such as Witchampton the loss of five able-bodied men was felt as a heavy blow. In the parishes of Whitegate, Aghada and Farsid in County Cork in Ireland, where the British army recruited heavily, almost one-third of the male population died in the Crimean War.

Nobody has counted the civilian casualties: victims of the shelling; people starved to death in besieged towns; populations devastated by disease spread by the armies; entire communities wiped out in the massacres and organized campaigns of ethnic cleansing that accompanied the fighting in the Caucasus, the Balkans and the Crimea. This was the first 'total war', a nineteenth-century version of the wars of our own age, involving civilians and humanitarian crises.

It was also the earliest example of a truly modern war — fought with new industrial technologies, modern rifles, steamships and railways, novel forms of logistics and communication like the telegraph, important innovations in military medicine, and war reporters and photographers directly on the scene. Yet at the same time it was the last war to be conducted by the old codes of chivalry, with 'parliamentaries' and truces in the fighting to clear the dead and wounded from the killing fields. The early battles in the Crimea, on the River Alma and at Balaklava, where the famous Charge of the Light Brigade took place, were not so very different from the sort of fighting that went on during the Napoleonic Wars. Yet the siege of Sevastopol, the longest and most crucial phase of the Crimean War, was a precursor of the industrialized trench warfare of 1914-18. During the eleven and a half months of the siege, 120 kilometres of trenches were dug by the Russians, the British and the French; 150 million gunshots and 5 million bombs and shells of various calibre were exchanged between the two sides.

The name of the Crimean War does not reflect its global scale and huge significance for Europe, Russia and that area of the world — stretching from the Balkans to Jerusalem, from Constantinople to the Caucasus — that came to be defined by the Eastern Question, the great international problem posed by the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Perhaps it would be better to adopt the Russian name for the Crimean War, the 'Eastern War' (Vostochnaia voina), which at least has the merit of connecting it to the Eastern Question, or even the 'Turco-Russian War', the name for it in many Turkish sources, which places it in the longer-term historical context of centuries of warfare between the Russians and the Ottomans, although this omits the crucial factor of Western intervention in the war.

The war began in 1853 between Ottoman and Russian forces in the Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, the territory of today's Romania, and spread to the Caucasus, where the Turks and the British encouraged and supported the struggle of the Muslim tribes against Russia, and from there to other areas of the Black Sea. By 1854, with the intervention of the British and the French on Turkey's side and the Austrians threatening to join this anti-Russian alliance, the Tsar withdrew his forces from the principalities, and the fighting shifted to the Crimea. But there were several other theatres of the war in 1854-5: in the Baltic Sea, where the Royal Navy planned to attack St Petersburg, the Russian capital; on the White Sea, where it bombarded the Solovetsky Monastery in July 1854; and even on the Pacific coastline of Siberia.

The global scale of the fighting was matched by the diversity of people it involved. Readers will find here a broad canvas populated less than they might have hoped (or feared) by military types and more by kings and queens, princes, courtiers, diplomats, religious leaders, Polish and Hungarian revolutionaries, doctors, nurses, journalists, artists and photographers, pamphleteers and writers, none more central to the story from the Russian perspective than Leo Tolstoy, who served as an officer on three different fronts of the Crimean War (the Caucasus, the Danube and the Crimea). Above all, through their own words in letters and memoirs, the reader will find here the viewpoint of the serving officers and ordinary troops, from the British 'Tommy' to the French-Algerian Zouaves and the Russian serf soldiers.

There are many books in English on the Crimean War. But this is the first in any language to draw extensively from Russian, French and Ottoman as well as British sources to illuminate the geo-political, cultural and religious factors that shaped the involvement of each major power in the conflict. Because of this concentration on the historical context of the war, readers eages for the fighting to begin will need to be patient in the early chapters (or even skip over them). What I hope emerges from these pages is a new appreciation of the war's importance as a major turning point in the history of Europe, Russia and the Middle East, the consequences of which are still felt today. There is no room here for the widespread British view that it was a 'senseless' and 'unnecessary' war — an idea going back to the public's disappointment with the poorly managed military campaign and its limited achievements at the time — which has since had such a detrimental impact on the historical literature. Long neglected and often ridiculed as a serious subject by scholars, the Crimean War has been left mainly in the hands of British military historians, many of them amateur enthusiasts, who have constantly retold the same stories (the Charge of the Light Brigade, the bungling of the English commanders, Florence Nightingale) with little real discussion of the war's religious origins, the complex politics of the Eastern Question, Christian-Muslim relations in the Black Sea region, or the influence of European Russophobia, without which it is difficult to grasp the conflict's true significance.

The Crimean War was a crucial watershed. It broke the old conservative alliance between Russia and the Austrians that had upheld the existing order on the European continent, allowing the emergence of new nation states in Italy, Romania and Germany. It left the Russians with a deep sense of resentment of the West, a feeling of betrayal that the other Christian states had sided with the Turks, and with frustrated ambitions in the Balkans that would continue to destabilize relations between the powers in the 1870s and the crises leading to the outbreak of the First World War. It was the first major European conflict to involve the Turks, if we discount their brief participation in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. It opened up the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire to Western armies and technologies, accelerated its integration into the global capitalist economy, and sparked an Islamic reaction against the West which continues to this day.

Each power entered the Crimean War with its own motives. Nationalism and imperial rivalries combined with religious interests. For the Turks, it was a question of fighting for their crumbling empire in Europe, of defending their imperial sovereignty against Russia's claims to represent the Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire, and of averting the threat of an Islamic and nationalist revolution in the Turkish capital. The British claimed they went to war to defend the Turks against Russia's bullying, but in fact they were more concerned to strike a blow against the Russian Empire, which they feared as a rival in Asia, and to use the war to advance their own free-trade and religious interests in the Ottoman Empire. For the Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, the war was an opportunity to restore France to a position of respect and influence abroad, if not to the glory of his uncle's reign, and perhaps to redraw the map of Europe as a family of liberal nation states along the lines envisaged by Napoleon I — though the influence of the Catholics on his weak regime also pushed him towards war against the Russians on religious grounds. For the British and the French, this was a crusade for the defence of liberty and European civilization against the barbaric and despotic menace of Russia, whose aggressive expansionism represented a real threat, not just to the West but to the whole of Christendom. As for the Tsar, Nicholas I, the man more than anyone responsible for the Crimean War, he was partly driven by inflated pride and arrogance, a result of having been tsar for twenty-seven years, partly by his sense of how a great power such as Russia should behave towards its weaker neighbours, and partly by a gross miscalculation about how the other powers would respond to his actions; but above all he believed that he was fighting a religious war, a crusade, to fulfil Russia's mission to defend the Christians of the Ottoman Empire. The Tsar vowed to take on the whole world in accordance with what he believed was his holy mission to extend his empire of the Orthodox as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem.

Historians have tended to dismiss the religious motives of the war. Few devote more than a paragraph or two to the dispute in the Holy Land — the rivalry between the Catholics or Latins (backed by France) and the Greeks (supported by Russia) over who should have control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem — even though it was the starting point (and for the Tsar a sufficient cause) of the Crimean War. Until the religious wars of our own age, it seemed implausible that a petty quarrel over some churchwarden's keys should entangle the great powers in a major war. In some histories the Holy Lands dispute is used to illustrate the absurd nature of this 'silly' and 'unnecessary war'. In others, it appears as no more than a trigger for the real cause of the war: the struggle of the European powers for influence in the Ottoman Empire. Wars are caused by imperial rivalries, it is argued in these histories, by competition over markets, or by the influence of nationalist opinions at home. While all this is true, it underestimates the importance of religion in the nineteenth century (if the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the rise of militant Islam have taught us anything, it is surely that religion plays a vital role in fuelling wars). All the powers used religion as a means of leverage in the Eastern Question, politics and faith were closely intertwined in this imperial rivalry, and every nation, none more so than Russia, went to war in the belief that God was on its side.
253 2011-07-10 The Crimean War was the first major war to be covered by professional foreign correspondents, who reported on the disastrous blundering of commanders and the horrors of medical treatment at the battlefront. Today, we remember fragmentary stories: the charge of the Light Brigade, symbolizing the blundering; Florence Nightingale, for the medical treatment. But the real war has faded away, eclipsed by the two vastly worse world wars that were to come.

Still, the Crimean War — in which three-quarters of a million soldiers and untold multitudes of civilians perished — shattered almost four decades of European peace. It inflamed Russia’s rivalry with the Ottoman Empire over the Balkans, providing the tinder for World War I. And by thwarting Russian’s ambitions in Europe, it made possible the fatal rise of Germany.

In “The Crimean War: A History,” Orlando Figes restores the conflict — which predated the American Civil War by eight years — as “a major turning point” in European and Middle Eastern history. He argues forcefully that it was “the earliest example of a truly modern war — fought with new industrial technologies, modern rifles, steamships and railways, novel forms of logistics and communication like the telegraph, important innovations in military medicine and war reporters and photographers directly on the scene.” The ferocious yearlong siege of Sevastopol “was a precursor of the industrialized trench warfare” of World War I.

The war itself was initiated when religious squabbles over holy places in the Ottoman towns of Jerusalem and Bethlehem prompted Russia to march troops into present-day Romania, threatening the partition of Ottoman lands. In response, the Ottoman Empire declared war, and Britain and France rallied to its defense. The devastating combat around the Black Sea proved unbearable for Russia: two-thirds of the soldiers killed in the war were Russian. After losing Sevastopol, Russia accepted a humiliating peace.

Figes, a renowned professor of history at the University of London, might be thought the loneliest of creatures, the Crimean War buff. But his history is a huge success. His harrowing recounting of Sevastopol presents an inferno of military absurdities and gruesome deaths, with people hit by rocks, gored with lances, hacked by swords, decapitated by shells and disemboweled. Figes artfully uses painstaking archival work — disturbing dust in London, Paris, Istanbul, Moscow and St. Petersburg — to expose the secret machinations of statesmen, but he never overlooks the awful human costs, like the nonchalant willingness of aristocratic Russian officers to sacrifice their peasant soldiers. And the book traces the roots of many modern crises: Britain, trying to create buffer zones against Russia, occupies Afghanistan and considers seizing Baghdad, where a British diplomat blithely proclaims that Sunnis and Shiites “could always be played off against each other.”

This is history with an argument. Figes maintains that the conflict was essentially a religious war, and he is frustrated that most writers have neglected that theme: “If the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the rise of militant Islam have taught us anything, it is surely that religion plays a vital role in fueling wars.” Figes writes of Russians and Turks clashing over “religious battlegrounds, the fault line between Orthodoxy and Islam,” and explains that “every nation, none more so than Russia, went to war in the belief that God was on its side.” The Crimean War “opened up the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire to Western armies,” and “sparked an Islamic reaction against the West which continues to this day.” The title of the British edition of the book is “Crimea: The Last Crusade.”
254 2011-07-10 His organization’s mission is encoded in the name T.O.T., an acronym for the Yiddish expression “Tuchis afn tish.”

“It means ‘Put your tuchis on the table,’ ” said Mr. Levin, a bearded, powerfully built man in his late 30s, who shaved off his side locks years ago out of personal preference. “In other words, ‘Show me the proof.’ And that’s what I do. I bring my proof to the people.”

Mr. Levin has provided key evidence in dozens of high-profile cases. In November, he found Yitzhak Shuchat, a Hasidic man from Crown Heights whom the police were seeking as a suspect in the 2008 beating of a police officer’s son, in a village outside . Though Mr. Levin was hired by a member of a Hasidic volunteer crime patrol, he turned his information over to the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, which has requested Mr. Shuchat’s extradition.

Mr. Levin said that information he learned in April led to the indictment of Rabbi Samuel Kellner of Brooklyn on charges that he had bribed a witness in a child molestation case against Baruch Mordechai Lebovits of Borough Park in an effort to extort money from Mr. Lebovits.

Mr. Levin was hired by the family of Mr. Lebovits after he was sentenced last year to up to 32 years in prison on a sexual abuse conviction. Mr. Lebovits has been released on bail pending the outcome of Rabbi Kellner’s trial.

Mr. Levin is intentionally vague about his background. He acknowledges that he served in the Israeli Army before moving to New York in 1994, but beyond that, he has managed to keep much of his life, and his livelihood, invisible.

“For years I tried to have not just a low profile, but no profile,” he said. “People would say to me, ‘I haven’t heard of you,’ and I’d say: ‘That’s great! If you’ve heard of me, you must have been in trouble.’ ”

Still, last year he started a Web site and began talking to the news media, figuring that he might as well capitalize on the publicized cases that had helped spread his name. But his main motivation, he said, was a growing concern for the safety of the Orthodox. Financial crime is on the rise in Orthodox neighborhoods, fueled, in Mr. Levin’s view, by the recession, high birth rates and a lack of higher education that keeps young people from getting high-paying jobs.

In the Hasidic section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for instance, police statistics show that while the number of violent crimes has fallen in the past 10 years, episodes of grand larceny have increased by more than 40 percent.

Unlike the retired government agents and police officials who often start their own private investigation companies, Mr. Levin can penetrate insular Orthodox strongholds without raising suspicion.

“There are a lot of intricate rules and coded behaviors that people from outside these communities don’t understand,” said Shmarya Rosenberg, a former Hasid and the author of the muckraking blog FailedMessiah.com, who has interviewed Mr. Levin for several articles. “You might think you blend in at the synagogue, for example, but to the Hasidim, it’s as if a monkey in a spacesuit has just descended from outer space.”

As an Orthodox Jew, Mr. Levin is also allowed to testify in rabbinical court, where matters like divorces and business disputes are settled according to Jewish law. Rabbis who oversee these trials often refuse to look at the explicit evidence Mr. Levin collects, like photographs of a husband committing adultery. They will, however, take his personal testimony.

All the same, non-Jews come in handy on the Sabbath, when Mr. Levin is not able to work. “Saturday is a very busy day for mischief inside the Hasidic world,” he said, adding that he mainly hires off-duty police officers to cover for him until the sun goes down. “Everyone thinks we’re sleeping. But in reality we’re wide awake.”

Mr. Levin outsources jobs that are beyond his expertise. Some Orthodox people come to him with marital problems because, he said, they do not know that therapists and marriage counselors exist. He recalled one client from who suspected her husband of infidelity. “I asked if she still loved her husband, and she said yes,” he recalled. “So I told her, ‘Don’t hire me.’ Because if I come back with the evidence, it’s too late for the marriage counselor.”

When investigating Internet-related crimes like and e-mail harassment, he turns to a small cadre of computer forensics specialists.

In fact, the only time Mr. Levin sits at a computer is to post news stories of interest to Jews on his blog each morning. (Subjects of recent posts have included the Colombian singer Shakira’s visit to the Western Wall and the scandal of , the former representative.) Mr. Levin spends most of his day driving around Brooklyn to consult new clients, meet with lawyers and potential sources, and deal with unexpected twists in his cases.

On a recent job in Borough Park, he stared through the tinted windows of his S.U.V. at a nervous-looking Hasidic man on the sidewalk. Days earlier, the man had claimed to possess a videotape of a rabbi having sex with two underage girls.

Mr. Levin, who was dressed in a beige topcoat, Burberry sunglasses and a baseball cap, expressed skepticism. “I’m not believing this baloney,” he said as his driver snapped photographs of the man through the windshield. “Look at how he’s pacing, and one after one. He’s not reliable, this guy.”

A few hours later, Mr. Levin met with the man and several others in an empty synagogue. It turned out that the videotape was actually held by a man who was not there, and who might hand it over in exchange for money, a prostitute and a new .

Back in the car, Mr. Levin said that because the holder of the tape was black, he would send a black off-duty police officer to try to recover it. “An Orthodox guy knocking on his door would not be a good start,” he said.

Though some members of the Orthodox faith say they have faced harassment or intimidation for committing even mildly subversive acts, Mr. Levin plays down the risks of spying and telling within the community. In rabbinical court, he said, the subjects of his investigations have become enraged. “They scream at me,” he said. “But that’s normal. Gradually they calm down.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Rosenberg of FailedMessiah said Mr. Levin faced a difficult choice when investigating big, newsworthy scandals. “You don’t want to draw bad publicity to the Orthodox faith,” he said, “but you also don’t want to see the crime continue.”

As a religious man, Mr. Levin says the crimes he sees pain him deeply.

“When I wake up in the morning, I pray to God and I want to believe that there are good people in the world,” he said. “But when I go to work every day and I see what I see, it’s a very big challenge for me.”

Mr. Levin’s wife of 13 years, Ruthie Levin, 33, said he often has trouble sleeping.

“Last night he was up every hour,” she said recently, sitting beside him outside their home. She added that the pressure of a new case involving two powerful rabbis was causing him stress.

Asked whether Mr. Levin had ever used his investigative skills in their relationship, she raised her eyebrows.

“Are you kidding?” she said. “Before we met, he knew all the boys I’d ever dated. He knew everything about me.”

How did he come to know these things? “I’d been looking into it,” Mr. Levin said, cracking a smile. “Let’s put it like that.”
255 2011-07-10 I don’t say that disrespectfully. It’s the kind of book that’s meant to be knocked off. “The Wreckage” has the kind of crisp, mildly implausible dialogue that marks the modern commercial thriller. Its pleasantly convoluted plot makes sense so long as you don’t examine it too closely. There are plenty of murders, chases, explosions and general mayhem.

You get the idea.

It’s also got a fistful of main characters, from the journalist in Baghdad who decides he can no longer just sit on the sidelines to the sexy United Nations accountant who falls in love with him even as she uncovers the fate of the missing billions. In London, a young woman with a troubled past robs people to pay the rent, and is being pursued by the bad guys because of a document she has unwittingly stolen. After she robs the retired detective — who is, of course, hard-bitten but with a heart o’ gold — he becomes her protector. There’s a hit man. Some C.I.A. operatives. A few terrorists.

Is it unfair to describe the characters in “The Wreckage” as cartoonish? A little, maybe. But they’re not George Smiley, either. Does it matter? Not really.

Given my background as a business journalist, I found myself particularly interested in the financiers. The Bach family — Alistair, the father, and Mitchell, the son — run Mersey Fidelity, a London firm meant to bear a passing resemblance to Goldman Sachs. Even as other firms were crumbling under the weight of the crisis, Mersey Fidelity came through not just unscathed but stronger than ever. Nobody quite knows how they did it — and those who do know aren’t saying.

In the post-crisis world, as one character puts it, “Mersey Fidelity was being touted as the beacon of the new banking system. It’s supposed to provide the Bank of England with a blueprint for new banking laws.”

I don’t think it will ruin your enjoyment of the novel if I divulge that the Bachs are in league with the bad guys. It’s pretty obvious from the start that’s where “The Wreckage” is headed. Not only does it turn out that Mersey Fidelity is deeply involved in the theft of all that money in Baghdad, but there are also “whispers” about how it survived the crisis without needing a government bailout. Drug money was funneled into certain banks, keeping them alive. Regulators looked the other way, according to one character, “because it helped keep bank doors open.”

This is where my credulity was stretched to the breaking point. It is certainly possible that some bank, somewhere, courted drug money during the financial crisis, but it sure didn’t happen on Wall Street or in London. To Robotham’s credit, though, this plot twist didn’t prevent me from finishing the book. He’d succeeded so well at peeling the onion slowly — it’s one of his real strengths as a writer — that by the time he trotted out this notion, I had too much momentum to stop reading.

Thus the real question becomes this: Will the firm get away with it, even after its crimes are exposed in the newspaper? To put it another way, is Robotham one of the tens of millions of people who are jaded and cynical and angry about the way the big banks brought the financial world to the brink of ruin, committed transgressions that were, if not illegal, certainly immoral, took bailouts from the taxpayers and then walked away scot-free, acting as if they had nothing to apologize for? Would he use his book to make a point about their mendacity?

I can’t tell you that, of course. It would wreck the surprise.

271 2011-07-11 “I think she’s over there celebrating, but I mean, we all still have a chance,” Kerr said. “There are two accessible pins on 17 and 18, and I’m playing great. So I’m going out and swing for the fences and hopefully tie it up.” She added: “It’s been a very long week. I’m excited I get to come out here and finish tomorrow.”

How long and torturous was the week? The Ironman Open aged Seo, who turned 25 on Friday.

“I was a little tired,” said Seo, who will become the eighth South Korean woman to win a major if her score holds up.

Angela Stanford is three behind with four holes to play. Over the first three rounds, she has played the last four holes in one over par. She has bogeyed No. 15 twice.

“Well, I think the good thing is I like the last four holes,” she said, “and so when I get out here in the morning, I’ll be ready to attack them.”

On a day that featured funnel-cloud sightings in the area and gassed golfers walking, there were few sights more surreal than Seo and her playing partners, Azahara Munoz and Jiyai Shin, sprinting to their golf balls between shots on the 17th hole.

Were they sprinting to beat another storm cell that was gaining on them or because they had been warned by United States Golf Association officials that they had fallen behind the pace? Whatever the reason, Seo did not seem fazed. She took a moment after hitting her second shot onto the 17th green to admire a rainbow that had formed in the gray sky.

Yani Tseng, who could have completed a career Grand Slam with a victory, played the first nine holes of her final round in three under par to get to one over, four strokes off the lead, but struggled down the stretch and finished at six over.

“I don’t know what happened,” Tseng said. “I thought I have chance. But on the back nine, I probably just tried too hard and thinking too much and didn’t make par.” She added: “It’s tough to play on and off. Sometimes you just want to try to get rhythm, and it’s really tough.”

Seo had booked a flight out of Colorado for Monday morning.

“I think my manager changed it,” she said.
272 2011-07-11 In the frenzied final days of New York’s legislative session, an important health care measure fell by the wayside. The Republican-led State Senate failed to pass a bill to establish a health insurance exchange where individuals and small businesses would be able to buy coverage starting in 2014. An identical bill had already passed the Democratic-led Assembly.

If the state fails to enact the authorizing legislation soon, it will find it extremely hard to qualify for a big federal grant to underwrite the entire cost of setting up the exchange and operating it through 2014. Tens of millions of dollars in federal support could be forfeited.

The Senate leadership pulled the bill before the vote because a few Republicans absurdly equated a vote for a health exchange with a vote to support the federal health care reforms. They refused to “give” Democrats both gay marriage and “Obamacare” on the same day. They need to realize that if the state does not set up a health exchange, the federal government will step in and do so.

Many senators said they were uncertain about the bill’s implications and were unsatisfied with answers they were getting from the bill’s sponsors. The bill pending in the Senate would create the exchange as a “public benefit corporation,” run by an independent board appointed by the governor and legislative leaders and authorized to develop regulations to comply with federal health reforms.

The bill also provides that if any provision of the federal reforms is repealed or found unconstitutional, the state’s exchange law becomes invalid. No matter what the Senate does, health care reform is going to happen. It makes sense for New York to set up its own exchange — crafted with an eye toward the state’s particular needs — and have Washington foot most of the bill. The senators should return later this year and pass this legislation in the form it was approved by the Assembly.
273 2011-07-11 The gunman in the Virginia Tech massacre, Seung-Hui Cho, should never have been allowed to buy the weapons he used in the 2007 rampage. He had been found mentally ill and ordered into treatment by a court, yet that record never made it into the database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System used for screening prospective gun purchasers.

Prompted by that tragedy, Congress approved a law, signed by President Bush in 2008, authorizing new grant money and penalties to encourage states to submit to the federal system pertinent records regarding individuals judged to be severely mentally ill, as well as others barred from buying or possessing firearms, including convicted felons and drug abusers. Although more records are in the system now, the results are still distressingly deficient.

As of April, six states — Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — had not submitted a single mental health record to the gun check system, according to a new report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group led by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Nineteen more states and the District of Columbia had submitted fewer than 100 mental health records apiece. Many federal agencies also lag in submitting relevant records to the system.

Meanwhile, the 2008 law is having an unfortunate side effect. In exchange for its help in passing the bill, the National Rifle Association insisted that to qualify for grants to help improve their record sharing, states must establish “a relief from disability” program that would allow people with histories of disqualifying mental health problems to apply to have their gun rights restored.

The result, as Michael Luo reported in The Times, has been a proliferation of new restoration laws, many with extremely lax standards, adopted at the N.R.A.’s behest, for determining whether a petitioner can be trusted to handle guns. Too often judges, lacking expertise in the area, make decisions without reviewing important evidence about an applicant’s mental health, sometimes after only a brief hearing or no hearing at all.

President Obama was on the right track two months after the mass killing in Tucson, when in an op-ed article in The Arizona Daily Star, he pointed to the missing state records and the need for an “instant, accurate, comprehensive” background check system. That would require ending the gun show loophole and other exceptions that allow dangerous individuals to avoid background checks.
274 2011-07-11 Toru Taniguchi of Japan made a 10 at the 14th. His countryman Nobuhito Sato made a 9.

Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the R&A, is not promising that St. George’s will be any easier than the course that produced a winning score of three over par, but he says the course will be a fairer test.

“There was no rain here between February and May, virtually not a drop,” he said Sunday. “The rain has come back to average level and the course has greened up — we are pleased with it. The player reaction has been very positive.

“The changes that we have made have helped at 1 and 18, which were unpopular tee shots last time. The greens are just lovely. All credit to green staff. The rough is patchy — it is not huge. I am hoping for not too much hacking out, but it will be a factor in distance control.”

Players who practiced in Sunday’s rather benign conditions were cautiously praising the course, mindful that three days can make a big difference at a British golf course. This may be the south of England, but it was difficult to ignore the rain that fell at Castle Stuart Golf Links, turning the course into a quagmire and shortening the Scottish Open to 54 holes.

Camilo Villegas, who was not in the field at the 2003 Open here, heard horror stories from those who were. He said he enjoyed his truncated 12-hole practice round (Nos. 1 through 9, 16, 17 and 18), but chose his words as carefully as he does his form-fitting, color-coordinated outfits.

“I have to say the golf course,” Villegas said, pausing for word selection, “is, um, nice. I like it. But I only played 12 holes. And the wind wasn’t blowing.”

What about some of the vagaries he might have heard about, balls caroming off line in the fairways and spilling into the rough like deranged bowling balls jumping from the pocket into the gutter?

“I kept hearing that,” he said. “But, to be honest, with the 12 holes I played, eh, I’m just going to be straight up and say it’s better than I’d heard. There are some tough holes out though.”

To be truthful, people do not want the British Open to be easy. When golf fans on the East Coast of the United States get up at 4 a.m. to catch some of the broadcast, they want to see the wind bending the flagsticks. They want to see balls knocked out of the air into bunkers that swallow players whole.

They may or may not get that. Rickie Fowler, who said he liked the way St. George’s was set up, has played here enough to know what a shift of wind can do.

“I heard they say it might switch around over the north at some point,” he said. “If it’s not blowing very much, you can definitely make birdies on a few holes out here.”

That could be why Dawson referred to the wind somewhat fondly as he called par on the 7,211-yard course “a tough 70.”

He added: “The last two days before had really been quite windy. If we get wind like that, 70 is a stunning score.”

Dawson said he nearly had to hit a driver into the 176-yard sixth hole.

“There was horrendous wind,” he said. “The pros would have been hitting 2-irons for sure.”

That would also separate the field, with great ball strikers rising to the top, the way Norman did in 1993, when he went around in 64 in the wind to win.

The last golfer to put on a ball-hitting performance like that in a major was Rory McIlroy at Congressional in the United States Open last month. He has not yet arrived at Royal St. George’s, but if he were to win here, the House of Fame would be back in vogue.
275 2011-07-11 BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syrian officials on Sunday formally opened what they described as a national dialogue aimed at a transition to multiparty democracy, but the country’s opposition leaders boycotted the event, calling it a sham to mask the government’s brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy protests that have shaken Syria’s ruling Assad family.

Although moderate politicians attended the talks in Syria, opposition figures said they would not participate without an end to the crackdown, which rights groups say has left an estimated 1,300 Syrians dead and 12,000 arrested.

The talks came almost four months after protesters first took to the streets across Syria demanding an end to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, whose clan has dominated Syrian political life since the 1970s and has shown little or no tolerance for dissent. The Syrian uprising was inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt that toppled authoritarian regimes in those countries earlier this year.

In his opening remarks, Vice President Farouk al-Shara said that the two-day talks, held at a state-owned resort in Demas, a town 12 miles outside of the capital, Damascus, were to discuss legislation that would allow for a transition to a multiparty system. He said the authorities would hold another meeting later to announce the new system.

Though his announcement answered a demand of pro-democracy activists, many Syrians dismissed it and said they were skeptical of a government that has repeatedly promised reforms and has yet to deliver any.
276 2011-07-11 Luke Donald had the perfect warm-up for the British Open with a nine-under-par 63 to win the rain-shortened Scottish Open in Inverness by four strokes, his first victory since becoming the top-ranked player in May. Donald started the third and final round a shot behind the three co-leaders but rolled in nine birdies and finished at 19-under 269.

¶ Steve Stricker sank a 25-foot putt from off the 18th green to win the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Ill., for the third straight year. Stricker led by five strokes at the turn, fell behind the rookie Kyle Stanley by two shots on the back nine of the Champions Tour event, then birdied the final two holes to close with a two-under 69 and beat Stanley by a stroke.

¶ Jeff Sluman shot a two-under 70 to win the Nature Valley Pebble Beach Open for the third time in four years. Sluman finished at 10-under 206 to beat David Eger by two strokes.
277 2011-07-11 David Ferrer defeated Mardy Fish, 7-5, 7-6 (3), 5-7, 7-6 (5), on Sunday to clinch a victory for Spain over the United States in a Davis Cup quarterfinal in Austin, Tex. Ferrer, who beat Andy Roddick on Friday night, fell backward when Fish’s final shot sailed wide, then jumped into the arms of Spain’s captain, Albert Costa. The win gave Spain an insurmountable 3-1 lead.

¶ John Isner became the first No. 1 seed to win the title in the 35-year history of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, beating sixth-seeded Olivier Rochus of Belgium, 6-3, 7-6 (6), on grass in Newport, R.I . The 6-foot-9 Isner used his overpowering serve to beat Rochus, at 5-6 the shortest player on the ATP Tour.

279 2011-07-11 LENOX, Mass. — James Levine has long been a mainstay of Tanglewood, though he will not appear at the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s summer home this season; shortly after resigning as the ensemble’s music director in March Mr. Levine cancelled all engagements here. But the show went on with aplomb at Tanglewood’s rainy opening night on Friday, with Charles Dutoit celebrating the 30th anniversary of his debut with the orchestra and conducting an all-Italian program of operatic and symphonic works.

The remarkable young soprano Angela Meade, making her debut with the orchestra, wowed the audience in the title role in Act I, Scene 4, of Bellini’s “Norma.” Ms. Meade, whose many accolades include winning the prestigious Richard Tucker Award in April, has already made her mark in this difficult role, and her gifts were on abundant display here. Singing with a distinctive, rich dark-hued voice, she demonstrated the requisite power, fluid coloratura and bel canto lyricism of a worthy interpreter of Bellini’s druid priestess. Her potent and refined rendition of “Casta Diva” was a treat.

Ms. Meade’s fine colleagues included the mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson as a radiant, expressive Adalgisa and the Italian tenor Roberto De Biasio, whose glistening, penetrating voice was heard to fine effect in Pollione’s opening aria. The bass-baritone James Morris offered a slightly frayed but serviceable Oroveso, and the promising young tenor Matthew DiBattista sang well as Flavio. Mr. Dutoit, the principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, accompanied the soloists and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, which was in good form with supple, flexible phrasing.

Ms. Meade, Mr. De Biasio and Mr. Morris also joined forces after intermission for a vivid rendition of the Trio from Act III of Verdi’s infrequently performed “I Lombardi,” a tale of love and rivalry amid war between Christians and Muslims. While the entire opera is seldom staged (the Metropolitan Opera last offered a brief run in 1993 and 1994), the Trio receives more frequent airings. The excerpt relays a scene called “The Conversion,” in which the Muslim Oronte converts to Christianity to win the Christian Giselda. Malcolm Lowe played the solo violin line, which represents the conversion, with subtle elegance.

Next came lively, deftly colored interpretations of two orchestral favorites: Rossini’s vivacious “William Tell” Overture and Respighi’s evocative tone poem “Pines of Rome.”
280 2011-07-11 MOSCOW — A riverboat filled with families cruising on the Volga River sank on Sunday, and about 100 people were missing hours later, feeding fears that the episode could be the country’s worst such accident in recent history.

The riverboat, called the Bulgaria, had set out with 188 people on board for a cruise in the Kuybyshev Reservoir, a reach of the upper Volga that is dammed and forms a broad lake, according to state television.

Another Volga River tour boat, the Arabella, which was the first to arrive at the scene, found people clinging to debris and life vests, and pulled 82 survivors from the water and one woman who had drowned, Russian television reported.

Initially, a local official in the Ministry of Emergency Situations said that aside from one woman who drowned, other vessels had picked up the remainder of the passengers and crew. But later Sunday, officials at the ministry’s headquarters in Moscow said 97 people were still missing after helicopters and motorboats had searched the river for hours. A plane with divers later took off from Moscow, suggesting a search for bodies rather than survivors.

In the confusion that followed the episode, the numbers on board and missing varied throughout the day.
281 2011-07-11 “No one here had anything to do with hacking,” said one journalist who did not want to be identified for fear of jeopardizing employment prospects with News International, the owner of The News of the World as well as other national newspapers.

There was widespread disdain for News International executives, especially the chief executive Rebekah Brooks, who most said had sacrificed their jobs to save her own. By the end of the evening, Ms. Brooks’s name had become a pejorative. And one staffer said expenses for this week had reached $4,000, a farewell gesture.

But drinks and vendettas were forgotten when crisp, freshly printed stacks of the final edition arrived at the pub around midnight. “Thank you and goodbye” read the headline, printed over smaller images of notable front covers.

Many headlines captured the swashbuckling swagger, the exuberant love of words, the hunger for a scoop, that had characterized Britain’s free-wheeling tabloid culture before it was irreparably tainted. “Chief Of Defence In Sex And Security Scandal.” “Duke And The Hooker.” “Runaway Bishop Confesses All.”

It may have been “grandly sustained by an eternal cast of randy vicars, misbehaving politicians and adulterous celebrities,” wrote the critic DJ Taylor, in the Independent newspaper, but The News of the World, was inexorably a part of Britain’s “sense of collective identity”.

“It is Sunday afternoon,” a quote from George Orwell’s 1946 essay “Decline of the English Murder” on the back cover of the final edition, reads, “preferably before the war. The wife is already asleep in the armchair, and the children have been sent out for a nice long walk. You put your feet up on the sofa, settle your spectacles on your nose and open The News of the World ...”

Those doing so on Sunday morning found an editorial on Page 3 that addressed “a period of a few years up to 2006,” during which “we lost our way. Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry.” Above the editorial were the defiant words “world’s greatest newspaper, 1843-2011.”

There was a sense, even among the newspaper’s detractors, that something would be lost if a public inquiry into the culture, ethics and practices of the British press, announced last week by Prime Minister David Cameron, draws the teeth of the tabloids.

The proudly sensational red-tops, as they are called, are famed for their wordplay — when President Obama met the Dalai Lama last year, the Sun ran with “Obama Lama Ding Dong” — and for ruthless methods which had, until now, stayed (just) on the right side of mischievous.

Even in today’s News of the World, those composing the crossword managed to insert a series of jibes against Ms. Brooks. Clues included “Mix in prison,” “catastrophe,” “Woman stares wildly at calamity” and “String of recordings.” Answers according to the Daily Mail, included “deplored”, “stench”, “stir”, “disaster” “menace”, “desist’, “racket” and “tart”.

Despite an increased print run of five million, copies of the paper could not be found at several newsstands on Sunday morning. Gregg Johns, 28, buying two copies in a convenience store near the newspaper’s headquarters in Wapping, east London, said he wanted a souvenir. “Well,” he said, shrugging, “it’s The News of the World, isn’t it?”

“I buy it every Sunday to go with my fry-up,” said Jacqui Arundel, 34, at the same convenience store, referring to a traditional English fried breakfast of sausages, bacon and eggs. “I suppose I’ll have to get the Sunday Sun instead, whenever that comes out,” she added, referring to reports that News International, the company which owns both titles, will start a Sunday version of The Sun newspaper as a replacement.

As Ms. Arundel spoke, the man who will make that decision, Rupert Murdoch, landed at an airport outside of London to deal with a crisis that, this week, is likely to broaden to examine the role of the Metropolitan Police in the handling an initial enquiry into phone hacking in 2006. Senior officers will testify to Parliament Tuesday.

The story dominated the front pages of the other newspapers stacked around The News of the World.

Many, like the Sunday edition of The Daily Mail, dug into speculation of a clubby bonhomie between politicians, police officers and proprietors that threatens to unravel. Indeed, Sunday’s edition of the Independent newspaper declared, it might be the beginning of “The War of the World”.

293 2011-07-12 With 1.3 million borrowers at risk of foreclosure, Bank of America has been overwhelmed by the surge in defaults, and the accord has raised hopes that this logjam will finally begin to ease. But skeptics say that previous arrangements, like another multibillion-dollar settlement by Bank of America in 2008, have barely made a dent in the problem.

“The mortgage servicers have repeatedly promised to do things and then not done them,” said Michael S. Barr, a former assistant Treasury secretary who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. “I think it’s positive in general, but I don’t expect it to be transformative of what we’ve witnessed from the mortgage servicers over the last four years.”

Matthew Weidner, a Florida lawyer who represents borrowers facing foreclosure, said he was skeptical of promises by the deal’s architects that lower monthly payments would be easier to obtain.

“It’s like giving aspirin to someone with cancer,” he said of the proposed assistance. “You had all the big players at the top of the pyramid negotiating but nobody was speaking for the homeowners who have far more at stake at the ground level.”

Still, for some of the homeowners now facing foreclosure who took out loans with Countrywide, the subprime specialist bought by Bank of America in 2008, the deal could bring a few quick improvements.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of America must now start transferring these borrowers to 10 smaller outside servicers, even without the deal being approved in court, which is not expected before November. The architects of the settlement say these subservicers will be far more efficient than Bank of America’s giant payment processing operation.

For example, an analysis of data by RBS prepared as part of the settlement found that Bank of America provided fewer modifications as a percentage of unpaid principal than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Litton and other servicers. In addition, borrowers defaulted again within six months in nearly one in five cases when modifications were made by Bank of America, a higher rate than other servicers that were studied.

Officials at Bank of America contend the company has made nearly 875,000 modifications since 2008, more than any other servicer.

Under the new proposal, subservicers will have to provide an answer to homeowner modification requests within 60 days of receiving paperwork, and will get up to 1.5 percent of the unpaid principal balance as an incentive fee for each successful permanent modification.

“We wanted smaller, high-touch servicers who would consider every modification option at once, not try this and that,” said Kathy D. Patrick, a Houston lawyer who represented the 22 private investors in the settlement. “Servicers get more in fees for successful modifications than for any other kind of workout, including foreclosure.”

The first homeowners should be transferred out of Bank of America by early fall, with each of the 10 subservicers taking up to 30,000 cases. Borrowers with mortgages 60 days past due who have been delinquent more than once in the last 12 months will receive priority in the switch, followed by homeowners who are 90 days past due but not in foreclosure.

Homeowners already in foreclosure or who have been declared bankrupt will go to the back of the line, although they will also eventually be transferred, Ms. Patrick said. More than 75 percent of the nearly 275,000 delinquent homeowners have not made a payment in more than 120 days or are already in foreclosure.

One unintended consequence of the problems at Bank of America and other large servicers is that many borrowers have managed to remain in their homes despite being in default, and without the income to qualify for a modification. At the time of foreclosure, the typical Bank of America borrower has not made a payment in 18 months.

What is more, according to the analysis of RBS data, it takes 30 months on average for a subprime borrower’s property to move from foreclosure to a final sale with Bank of America, nearly a year longer than Wells Fargo, and 10 months longer than SPS, a smaller subservicer likely to be among the 10 selected to take over the former Countrywide loans.

“Countrywide made a lot of bad loans and borrowers with no money can’t afford a modification,” said Peter Swire, a former special assistant for housing policy in the Obama administration who helped oversee earlier federal efforts to promote modifications. He is now a professor at Ohio State University. “One discouraging problem is that only a small fraction of Countrywide borrowers will likely qualify,” Professor Swire said.

Delores Gosha hopes she will be one of the lucky ones.

It has been more than a year since she last made a mortgage payment to Bank of America, raising the risk that her bungalow in the Cleveland suburbs will end up in foreclosure. The bank, she says, has given varying answers as to whether she qualifies for a modification, telling her she did not at one point last week only to reverse course days later and say it was still under consideration. Ms. Gosha said she had had to deal with a multitude of representatives and submit the same documents over and over.

While a new servicer might not give her the answer she has been praying for, she said, at least she will get an answer.

“I’ve been up and down,” said Ms. Gosha, who is a clerk at a Cleveland hospital. “Can’t somebody tell me something?”

295 2011-07-12 Oosthuizen hardly looked overwrought himself last year at age 27 as he started the final round at St. Andrews with a four-shot lead and — despite the grandeur of the course and the utter lack of comparable experiences to draw on — coolly built on it to win by seven strokes.

True, Oosthuizen had shot an attention-demanding round of 57 as an amateur at home in South Africa and had won his first European tour event earlier in 2010. But he had missed the cut in seven of his previous eight major appearances and was on no one’s short list of potential champions except perhaps his own after some strong early practice sessions at the Old Course.

A year later, he has won one other tour event but has not yet become a consistent threat or a household name, or at least not according to how he pronounces it in his household: WUHST-high-zin.

“It’s not an easy surname,” he said, flashing the gap-toothed grin Monday that came so easily last year. “You know, it’s probably more annoying when they say, ‘I’ve been practicing it for a month,’ and they still get it completely wrong.”

Stricker says the Open produces surprises because links golf remains a rare form of competition for most professionals, particularly those based on the United States tour. There is also the infamous British weather.

“Here, it can be very extreme, so you can really get a bad deal here where one side of the draw has a distinct advantage,” Stricker said.

While Curtis and Oosthuizen have gone on to win tournaments since their stunning Open victories, Todd Hamilton, the American who was the surprise Open champion in 2004, has yet to win another tour event since he held off Ernie Els in a playoff. In the six British Opens Hamilton has played since he won at Royal Troon, he has missed the cut four times and finished in a tie for 32nd and a tie for 68th.

Paul Lawrie, the last Scotsman to win the claret jug, has never cracked so much as the top 40 at another British Open since beating Jan Van de Velde and Justin Leonard in 1999 at Carnoustie in the playoff that capped one of the wildest rides in the history of a tournament that was first staged in 1860.

Lawrie, a journeyman from Aberdeen, was 10 shots back at the start of the final round and won only because Van de Velde inexplicably gambled and then threw away a three-shot lead on the 72nd hole.

Unexpected indeed, and though Lawrie, Hamilton, Curtis and Oosthuizen did all manage to prevail against the odds, there have been other Opens in the last decade that nearly produced unlikely outcomes with well-known protagonists. Greg Norman led the 2008 Open after three rounds at age 53 before fading; Tom Watson led the 2009 Open after 71 holes at age 59 before generating groans of disappointment worldwide and losing to his fellow American Stewart Cink.

“There’s probably 130 guys that could win this week, have a legitimate chance,” Curtis said of the 156-man field. “You’re going to take here and there 20 that may not be feeling well or their game is really bad or whatever coming in, but pretty much anyone in the field can win this week. It’s just a matter of having the right things go your way and making a few putts here and there.”

Other major championships have had their share of unheralded winners, too, in what was known as the Tiger Woods era. Consider Lucas Glover, the winner of the 2009 United States Open, or Charl Schwartzel, Oosthuizen’s fellow South African and boyhood rival, at this year’s Masters.

But no major has made the surprise as unsurprising as this major, and though Stricker — among the favorites — is hardly hoping for more of the same, he is bracing for it.

“They get it going for a week and get the confidence rolling and enjoy the course and have all the things going for them,” he said. “I really do think anybody can win.”
296 2011-07-12 With 1.3 million borrowers at risk of foreclosure, Bank of America has been overwhelmed by the surge in defaults, and the accord has raised hopes that this logjam will finally begin to ease. But skeptics say that previous arrangements, like another multibillion-dollar settlement by Bank of America in 2008, have barely made a dent in the problem.

“The mortgage servicers have repeatedly promised to do things and then not done them,” said Michael S. Barr, a former assistant Treasury secretary who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. “I think it’s positive in general, but I don’t expect it to be transformative of what we’ve witnessed from the mortgage servicers over the last four years.”

Matthew Weidner, a Florida lawyer who represents borrowers facing foreclosure, said he was skeptical of promises by the deal’s architects that lower monthly payments would be easier to obtain.

“It’s like giving aspirin to someone with cancer,” he said of the proposed assistance. “You had all the big players at the top of the pyramid negotiating but nobody was speaking for the homeowners who have far more at stake at the ground level.”

Still, for some of the homeowners now facing foreclosure who took out loans with Countrywide, the subprime specialist bought by Bank of America in 2008, the deal could bring a few quick improvements.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of America must now start transferring these borrowers to 10 smaller outside servicers, even without the deal being approved in court, which is not expected before November. The architects of the settlement say these subservicers will be far more efficient than Bank of America’s giant payment processing operation.

For example, an analysis of data by RBS prepared as part of the settlement found that Bank of America provided fewer modifications as a percentage of unpaid principal than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Litton and other servicers. In addition, borrowers defaulted again within six months in nearly one in five cases when modifications were made by Bank of America, a higher rate than other servicers that were studied.

Officials at Bank of America contend the company has made nearly 875,000 modifications since 2008, more than any other servicer.

Under the new proposal, subservicers will have to provide an answer to homeowner modification requests within 60 days of receiving paperwork, and will get up to 1.5 percent of the unpaid principal balance as an incentive fee for each successful permanent modification.

“We wanted smaller, high-touch servicers who would consider every modification option at once, not try this and that,” said Kathy D. Patrick, a Houston lawyer who represented the 22 private investors in the settlement. “Servicers get more in fees for successful modifications than for any other kind of workout, including foreclosure.”

The first homeowners should be transferred out of Bank of America by early fall, with each of the 10 subservicers taking up to 30,000 cases. Borrowers with mortgages 60 days past due who have been delinquent more than once in the last 12 months will receive priority in the switch, followed by homeowners who are 90 days past due but not in foreclosure.

Homeowners already in foreclosure or who have been declared bankrupt will go to the back of the line, although they will also eventually be transferred, Ms. Patrick said. More than 75 percent of the nearly 275,000 delinquent homeowners have not made a payment in more than 120 days or are already in foreclosure.

One unintended consequence of the problems at Bank of America and other large servicers is that many borrowers have managed to remain in their homes despite being in default, and without the income to qualify for a modification. At the time of foreclosure, the typical Bank of America borrower has not made a payment in 18 months.

What is more, according to the analysis of RBS data, it takes 30 months on average for a subprime borrower’s property to move from foreclosure to a final sale with Bank of America, nearly a year longer than Wells Fargo, and 10 months longer than SPS, a smaller subservicer likely to be among the 10 selected to take over the former Countrywide loans.

“Countrywide made a lot of bad loans and borrowers with no money can’t afford a modification,” said Peter Swire, a former special assistant for housing policy in the Obama administration who helped oversee earlier federal efforts to promote modifications. He is now a professor at Ohio State University. “One discouraging problem is that only a small fraction of Countrywide borrowers will likely qualify,” Professor Swire said.

Delores Gosha hopes she will be one of the lucky ones.

It has been more than a year since she last made a mortgage payment to Bank of America, raising the risk that her bungalow in the Cleveland suburbs will end up in foreclosure. The bank, she says, has given varying answers as to whether she qualifies for a modification, telling her she did not at one point last week only to reverse course days later and say it was still under consideration. Ms. Gosha said she had had to deal with a multitude of representatives and submit the same documents over and over.

While a new servicer might not give her the answer she has been praying for, she said, at least she will get an answer.

“I’ve been up and down,” said Ms. Gosha, who is a clerk at a Cleveland hospital. “Can’t somebody tell me something?”
297 2011-07-12 Alcoa, the nation’s largest aluminum producer, said on Monday that second-quarter profit more than doubled after prices for the metal rose.

Net income was $322 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $136 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier, Alcoa reported after the markets closed. Sales gained 27 percent to $6.59 billion, exceeding the $6.31 billion average estimate of seven analysts in the Bloomberg survey.

Earnings, excluding $38 million in restructuring and debt tender offer costs and other one-time items, were $364 million, or 32 cents a share, missing the 33-cent average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The market should be pleased that Alcoa is showing these strong year-over-year trends,” Jorge Beristain, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said on Bloomberg TV. “They are managing to hold the line on costs.”

Alcoa’s chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, reiterated his forecast for global demand to increase by 12 percent in 2011 and double by the end of the decade as Asian countries build more offices and buy more aircraft, cars and trains.

“Although the economic recovery is uneven, the overall outlook for Alcoa — and for aluminum — remains positive,” Mr. Kleinfeld said in a statement. “Demand for aluminum continues to rise and so does growth in our major markets.”

Alcoa, traditionally the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings, was little changed in after-hours trading.
298 2011-07-12 One of the magnetic forces holding together a lot of New York’s better jazz musicians right now is the hip-hop composer and producer J Dilla, who died in 2006. It has to do with the fascinatingly human lurch and pop of his sampled rhythm tracks, but something bigger, too: the improvisational curiosity he had about rhythm and sound. He’s at the heart of the contention that hip-hop and jazz have internal points of contact, not just philosophical ones.

And this is one of the entryways for understanding Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, the young violinist, composer and arranger who led his own ensemble, full of great jazz musicians from two coasts, in a concert on Saturday night at Annunciation Park in Harlem. A work-for-hire violinist and string arranger, he has more recently started to become a kind of Wynton Marsalis or Gunther Schuller for the postsoul, semijazz, pacifist-hip-hop continuum: a leader of skilled ensembles, a celebrator of repertories, an organizer of legacies.

Humble, respectful, a little mystical, he and his interests would appeal to ferocious record snobs but also to middle-aged urbanites who like their music calming and uplifting and conscious, in the hip-hop sense of the word. Is it relevant that Mr. Atwood-Ferguson is a Nichiren Buddhist, the same sect that includes Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Buster Williams and Bennie Maupin? Somehow it seems so.

In any case he has become connected with organizations on the East and West Coasts that need someone exactly like him: in Los Angeles, the music and film production house Mochilla and the record label Brainfeeder; and in New York, the concert producer Revive Da Live, which organized Saturday’s concert through Harlem Stage.

A few years ago with a full orchestra he reimagined some of J Dilla’s music on a record called “Suite for Ma Dukes.” On Saturday with a smaller ensemble — 12 musicians, including himself — he played Dilla twice: rare and interestingly slouchy tracks called “You’re My Lady” and “Miroslav Vitous,” on which the bassist Kenneth Rodgers wobbled his notes down a half-step, and Mr. Atwood-Ferguson double-timed his violin strokes to sound like a strobing, electronic-tremolo effect.
299 2011-07-12 Among those I’m hearing from are business travelers who received camera-generated tickets in the mail from places they drove through months earlier. Most business travelers pay them because they can’t reasonably return to the place to fight the ticket. Some complained that they have no choice, as car rental companies routinely pay a camera ticket and subsequently charge the customer’s credit card.

I’ve heard from long-haul truckers worried about their drivers’ licenses, and from traffic engineers and police officers disputing camera industry claims about safety.

Many readers also note the documented increase in rear-end collisions at intersections where the fear of being flashed by a red-light camera can cause drivers to slam on brakes at the first sign of lights turning yellow.

Some people sent videos showing how yellow light timing seems to be shortened at some intersections to catch more drivers. Others pointed out that red-light cameras also routinely issue citations to drivers who are prudently making turns in intersections when the light suddenly changes.

And a surprising number of travelers wrote warnings about driving internationally, especially in Europe, where traffic cameras are even more widespread.

Some business travelers complained of receiving multiple citations on a short drive in a rental car near an airport.

“I received two speeding tickets, six minutes apart” on a stretch of road near the Phoenix airport where the speed limit was unclear, one reader, John Hristov, said.

And Dan Manor, another reader, wrote that he still remembered Phoenix for the surprise he received in the mail weeks after a short business trip: three speeding tickets, for a total of $663.

Larry Lappen, a salesman, said the last moving violation he had was in 1981 — until he recently got one in the mail for a red-light violation in a small Florida town.

“I remembered the event very well, because it seemed at the time that the yellow light duration was much shorter than normal,” he wrote.

Like others, he investigated, returning to the intersection with a stopwatch to find that the yellow light was unusually short in duration. (A yellow light should last about one full second for every 10 miles an hour of speed limit in the area, one traffic engineer wrote me.) “I was there for 45 minutes and saw three cars caught in that same dilemma zone,” Mr. Lappen wrote.

Due process is, of course, a widespread concern. David Durkee said he received a camera ticket in Colorado. “They stated it was only a $40 fine” without points on his driving record — unless he appealed, in which case points and extra costs could be added, he said. “It was made to look like forking over the cash was the only solution.”

There’s voluminous research about traffic cameras on the Web site of the National Motorists Association. The group opposes the cameras, which are typically operated by commercial vendors that get a big piece of the revenue and press municipalities for greater adoption.

“A financially viable ticket camera program can only be sustained by maintaining a travel environment that generates significant numbers of violations,” said Jim Baxter, the group’s president.

And here’s some bad news from Steven P. Scalici, a New York traffic engineer. He predicted that as technology improves, “camera detection is going to get even more stringent.” He added, “Red-light cameras have become a clear source of government income, and movements are afoot to increase that largess.”
300 2011-07-12 BERLIN — In a turn of events worthy of a spy novel, the German government said Monday that it had begun an investigation into reports that classified blueprints for its new billion-dollar foreign intelligence headquarters had been stolen.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the intelligence agency had established a commission working under “high pressure” to look into whether plans for its new headquarters in Berlin had been taken and, if so, how far-reaching the security breach had been.

“The government is keenly interested in clarifying the situation quickly,” Mr. Seibert said, adding that it took the matter “very seriously.”

The weekly news magazine Focus first reported that the classified building plans had been stolen, including those for the technical and logistics center that a former high-ranking official at the agency called the “beating heart” of the complex. According to the magazine, the plans included “the exact function of every single room, the thickness of each wall, the exact position of every toilet and every emergency exit and every security checkpoint.”

Wolfgang Bosbach, a leading member of Mrs. Merkel’s party, told the newspaper Saarbrücker Zeitung that it was “embarrassing to the highest degree that a secret service of all things would have secret documents stolen.” It is also an embarrassment for Mrs. Merkel’s government, which already was coping with severe criticism over the leaked news of a secret agreement to send 200 tanks to Saudi Arabia.

The German public television station ARD reported that the theft had taken place more than a year ago from the supposedly secure construction site and that the blueprints may have been taken on a USB stick. The core of the building may have to be redesigned as a result, ARD reported.
301 2011-07-12 Until recently there was little proof that medical errors spike in the summer when new medical trainees start working at teaching hospitals — a phenomenon known as the “July effect.” But a new review has found evidence that death rates do increase in July, and that many patients stay in the hospital longer than in other months.

The paper, published Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine, is believed to be the first systematic review of the data from previous studies. While the analysis found inconsistencies among nearly 40 studies examined, the data produced by the largest and best-designed ones indicated that patient death rates in teaching hospitals increase by 8 percent in July.

Those studies also reported longer hospital stays, more drawn-out procedures and higher hospital charges in July, when 20 to 30 percent of the more experienced doctors-in-training leave and a class of newly minted doctors starts working at teaching hospitals, said Dr. John Q. Young, the paper’s lead author, who is associate program director for the residency training program in psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco.

“This changeover is dramatic, and it affects everything,” Dr. Young said. “It’s like a football team in a high-stakes game, and in the middle of that final drive you bring out four or five players who never played in the pros before and don’t know the playbook, and the players that remained get changed to positions they never played before, and they never practiced together. That’s what happens in July.”
302 2011-07-12 Her birdie attempt on No. 17, a 603-yard par 5, grazed the cup. On the finishing hole, Ryu hit a perfect 6-iron approach shot to 6 feet and drained the putt for a closing two-under-par 69 and a 72-hole total of three-under 281.

The Americans Cristie Kerr and Angela Stanford also hoped to force a playoff, but fell short. Kerr closed with a 71 and finished two strokes back. Stanford finished with a 284 after shooting a  72 in the final round.

The playoff began with Ryu and Seo two-putting for pars on No. 16. On the next hole, Ryu made a routine birdie while Seo scrambled for a bogey after her drive found a fairway bunker.

At 18, Ryu hit her approach to 4 feet and birdied the hole for the second time in an hour, seemingly oblivious that the hole had yielded an average of only 6.5 birdies in the first four rounds.

“I remember yesterday, the caddie of So Yeon said, ‘We’re going to be chasing you,’ ” Seo said. “And then the result is they were chasing me, and unfortunately I couldn’t win this time.” She added, “I feel very happy for Korean fans that a South Korea player won this great, big tournament.”

Ryu, 21, became the fifth South Korean to win the Open and the fourth in seven years. But there was nothing ho-hum about her victory.

Coming into the Open, South Koreans had been shut out of the winner’s circle this year on the L.P.G.A. Tour. It was no inconsequential drought for a country that has averaged nearly three champions a year on the tour over the last decade.

The South Koreans’ lack of success caused great consternation at home, where a couple of theories took root. The first was that the golfers had become complacent, losing their “hungry spirit” amid all their success. The second was that the tour was lengthening its courses with the aim of Korean-proofing them.

There are no South Koreans in the top 10 in driving distance, that much is true; Pak is the highest-ranked player at No. 11 with a 263.8-yard average. But the air went out of the conspiracy theory with the success of Ryu and Seo on the East Course, which played at 6,860 yards for the fourth round and the playoff and 7,047 the rest of the week.

Pak, a 25-time winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour, was asked if she thought she would see a day like this, with two South Koreans vying for the Open championship.

“I never expect that,” said Pak, who completed her fourth round Monday and was tied for 45th at 297.

During the postplayoff celebration on the 18th green, Pak told Ryu and Seo that they had done “a really great job” and that she was “very proud” of them.

Pak’s words were a salve that relieved some of the pain of defeat for Seo, who said, “She is legend for us.”

Seo added: “Second place is amazing. But, you know, sports is always about winning, so that’s a little bad. But I’m happy for the result. I learned many things from this week.”

Pak’s 1998 Open victory came on the heels of her win at the L.P.G.A. Championship and was televised in South Korea. Among those who watched, transfixed, was an 8-year-old Ryu.

“When I was young, my goal is violinist,” Ryu said. “I really like music. Until Se Ri really won the tournament, I was only enjoying golf as a hobby. But I really enjoyed as much coverage that she was receiving through the network TVs in Korea. Seeing that made me want to play more.”

Pak, 33, said: “Everybody say that I just kind of open the door for them. I don’t know. They are not afraid to come out and play. They can handle the pressure, which is the biggest thing.”

Ryu said she did not sleep well Sunday night because she could not stop thinking about the 16th hole, where she would be resuming the biggest round of her young career when the sun came up.

“So my condition is not great this morning,” she said, “but I made a birdie on 18 and I have more energy.”

The advantage Seo had of finishing on Sunday — of not spending all night playing any remaining holes in her mind — apparently became a disadvantage in the playoff.

“Yeah, is good for me,” Ryu said, “because Hee Kyung just practice but I play the three holes in the same conditions. Yeah, it’s really huge benefit.”

More than an hour after her victory, Ryu said it still felt like a dream. It amazed her that her name had joined Pak’s on the United States Open trophy.

“Se Ri started it,” she said. “I just followed.”
303 2011-07-12 Cutting down on salt may lower blood pressure, but there is no evidence that it leads to fewer deaths or reduces the risk of heart attack or stroke in the long run, according to a new report.

The meta-analysis, by The Cochrane Review, included six randomized clinical trials. It found that people who cut their dietary salt intake in half were able to modestly lower their blood pressure. Medication, however, was more effective than dietary change.

But even when the trials were examined collectively, they still were too small to provide proof of significant differences in heart events and deaths, possibly because people have a hard time sticking to a low-salt diet over time, the authors said.

Much of the earlier evidence that suggested greater benefits from low-sodium diets was drawn from observational studies comparing different population groups, rather than randomized trials, which are considered the gold standard in medicine, said the review’s lead author, Rod S. Taylor, professor of health services research at Peninsula Medical School at University of Exeter in England.

Dr. Taylor said that people should still try to limit salt in food but that additional steps, like warning labels about salt content in processed foods, are needed. “The results do not mean that asking people to reduce salt intake is not a good thing,” he said.
304 2011-07-12 I TRAVEL a lot from my home in New York to San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The flight delays trying to get to and from these cities have an upside. I get a chance to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes: people-watching.

I’m a New Yorker and proud of it. But I find that New Yorkers, myself included, will go out of their way to ignore each other when flying. But every time I sit next to people from Los Angeles, those people want to chat, about anything. They wind up “friending” seatmates on Facebook before the flight lands. People from San Francisco want to talk, too, except the conversation is usually about finding ways to save the world.

All I want to do is get to my meeting in one piece. It’s not that I’m unfriendly. I just don’t want to chat. Spilled drinks have turned me into a chatterbox, though.

I often fly with some colleagues, and we were headed to Pittsburgh on a small plane. My seatmate spilled his drink on me as he was checking out the work I was doing on my laptop. I was very polite about the spill; it was no big deal. But the guy wound up talking to me the entire flight. Seriously. I couldn’t get out of it. It was nonstop conversation.

My colleague, who was sitting a few seats away, saw what was happening and couldn’t stop laughing. She knew how much I was tortured by spending the entire flight in conversation. When we exited the plane, the guy kept talking. I’m a speed walker and I swear I had to literally almost run away from the guy.

The same thing happened on a night flight to Paris. I was traveling with a colleague who is very clumsy, and she admits it. She wound up spilling a glass of Champagne on her seatmate. Apparently, the guy got a little angry, so she talked to him quite a bit to smooth things over.
305 2011-07-12 But there are still challenges to creating your own sun-driven power generator, installers say. Not every building is suitable; the panels should be placed at a 30- to 40-degree angle facing south to maximize their power, said Mark Chandarpal of Go Solar Green NY in Hollis, Queens, who put in the Antonios’ panels. That is easier on a sloped roof like the Antonios’, but a flat roof would require a support structure, he said.

Some roofs are simply too small or shady to pay off. For example, a neighbor of the Antonios’ son wanted to install a system on his house in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, but could not because the city would not let him prune the tall trees shading his roof.

Indeed, there is a web of bureaucracy to navigate, generally more tangled than in other cities. Roger Ditman, who has been trying to put a system on his brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, since August, said he found the process frustrating. It took six months for the Landmarks Preservation Commission to sign off, he said; now he is waiting for a waiver from the Fire Department because his plan would cover a skylight and would not leave a required six-foot access corridor for firefighters to use if they need to move across the roof. “If the city is serious about pushing solar, they have to have one agency to which you can go,” he said.

But even if he gets that approval and a permit from the Buildings Department, there is no guarantee that it will go smoothly, because the solar projects do not undergo a full plan review until after construction is completed. As a result, many customers and contractors find themselves moving panels around later because of unanticipated objections from the city.

“The Buildings Department and Fire Department have really worked with the solar contractors to make it work,” said Al Frishman of Aeon Solar, which designs and installs systems in New York, New Jersey, Colorado and California. “But it’s very stressful after you think that you’re good to find out that you’re not good.”

The Buildings Department said that it was planning to change its procedures, and would soon begin reviewing plans before installation. The upfront cost, of course, remains a major disincentive, although with government and power authority rebates and credits, solar customers can often get much of their investments back. The Antonios said that the rebates and credits would ultimately pay them back about $62,000 of their $72,000 outlay. And the monthly savings can be substantial.

In Park Slope, Martha Cameron said that the 18 solar panels Aeon installed on her brownstone roof covered the electric needs of her duplex, “including all the guilt-free air-conditioning.” And in Belle Harbor, where the Antonios say using solar has made them more aware of conserving other resources like gas and water, they now pay about $7 a month, down from $140 to $180. When the system generates more power than the house needs, the Long Island Power Authority buys back the extra, which last year added up to $319.61.

“When God gives us the sun,” Mrs. Antonio said, “we get the check.”

There are several other houses in the area that have been keeping Mr. Chandarpal busy. A few blocks away, Andrea Gitter said she had been inspired after seeing her brother’s array of panels pointed toward the coastline. “There was no downside between the tax breaks and the incentives, and to do something that made me feel like a good person, doing something good for the environment,” she said. Her bills have dropped to $5 or $6, a savings of about $200 a month. Still, she cautioned, “sometimes we have very high bills — like $20.”
306 2011-07-12 Using that data, Mr. Milke calculated that airline passengers traveling within a single country in Europe last year were paying about 11 cents a mile, including taxes and fees, or 14 cents a mile to fly between two European countries. In the United States, by contrast, passengers were paying about 23 cents a mile.

Since these figures were based on a limited number of case studies, results from a wider set of data would probably vary. In fact, the Air Transport Association, the airlines’ trade group, calculates that domestic tickets in the United States cost about 16 cents a mile, excluding taxes, or at least 19 cents a mile with taxes (using the group’s estimate that taxes add 20 percent to the price of a ticket).

Carlos Mestre, deputy head of the European Commission’s transport unit, said the European Union did not collect data from airlines that would enable it to calculate a similar cost per mile. But based on information the commission has gathered, it has published numerous reports that say airfares have decreased significantly since the late 1990s, when the European Union began allowing airlines to fly freely among member countries.

“Prices have gone down quite dramatically,” Mr. Mestre said, explaining that the rapid expansion of low-fare carriers has increased competition on many routes that were once dominated by a single national airline. The number of routes within Europe has also increased 140 percent from 1992 to 2010.

Low-fare airlines now carry more than a third of all passengers traveling within Europe, forcing older competitors to lower prices, especially on popular routes.

“In Europe, there has been an awful lot more competition in the last 10 years,” said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association. “That has led to a lot more choice for passengers as well as it being cheaper to travel.”

Mr. Pearce said European travelers had benefited from the fact that many large cities had multiple airports, allowing newer airlines access to these markets. That is not so much the case in the United States, where airlines like Southwest have fought to obtain scarce takeoff and landing slots in congested cities like New York.

European airlines also face more competition than their American counterparts from other forms of transportation, particularly Europe’s robust rail network.

That competition is likely to increase in the coming years, since the European Commission recently announced an initiative to standardize the information on rail schedules and prices across member countries, making it easier for travelers to compare the cost of airlines versus the train between two cities. On some routes, ferries could be part of that comparison.

Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, said the shorter distances between cities in Europe was another factor influencing the competitive landscape.

“What type of model capitalizes on frequent short-distance flights?” he said. “Low-fare airlines.”

Those shorter distances also mean that driving is a viable option for many trips within Europe, especially now that border controls have been lifted, creating further competition for European carriers, Mr. Lott said.

Some analysts also note that Europe is going through a competitive phase that already took place in the United States after airline deregulation in the 1970s.

“They’re earlier in a process the U.S. experienced a while ago,” William S. Swelbar, a research engineer with the M.I.T. International Center for Air Transportation, said, noting that when adjusted for inflation, the average domestic fare in the United States has declined more than 50 percent since deregulation.

“We have a maturing market and maturing airlines,” he said. “As a result we’re seeing prices go up.”

Others argue that regulatory policies in the United States favor established airlines, stifling competition and making it harder for new carriers to enter the market and succeed.

Mr. Milke is among those who say they believe that rules prohibiting foreign-owned airlines from operating in the United States — for example, allowing Aer Lingus to fly passengers from Boston to Chicago — keeps ticket prices higher than they would be if this restriction were dropped.

“Low fares are the result of the removal of barriers to competition,” he said. “With lower prices, people travel a lot more, and that creates jobs.”
307 2011-07-12 “Italy is too big to fail,” said Moisés Naím, a senior associate in the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. “If Italy really gets hit by contagion because of political mismanagement, it would be a threat not only to the euro zone, but to the global economy.”

Political soap operas in Italy — especially those featuring Mr. Berlusconi — are nothing new. Nor do they usually matter much to financial markets, even after the debt crisis hit Europe. The widespread problems in Italy’s economy, which has been sluggish for the better part of a decade, also rang few alarm bells.

What’s more, Italy’s banks are sound; they never speculated in a housing bubble. The current annual budget deficit is low, at about 4.6 percent of gross domestic product. And while Italy issues the largest amount of bonds of any euro zone country, Italians own about half the debt, making it less vulnerable to the follies of financial markets.

But with interest rates rising, Italy’s economy is not growing fast enough to cover an accumulated debt load of 120 percent of gross domestic product, the second-highest in Europe, after Greece. The International Monetary Fund expects growth to pick up only slightly, to 1.3 percent in 2012.

In a sign of how quickly things have turned against the country, the stock market regulator imposed emergency rules on Monday against speculation after shares in Italian banks slumped for a fifth consecutive session. The cost of insuring Italy’s sovereign debt against default surged to a record high, and the interest on its 10-year bond leaped to a record 5.67 percent.

While that is still well below what Greece pays, analysts say Italy will have serious problems if its borrowing costs exceed 6 percent.

“Italy is a banana republic that didn’t depend so much on foreign capital in the past, but now it does, and markets are less forgiving,” said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. “Italy is in the danger zone; that is quite clear now.”

Italy tends to function best in crisis management mode, analysts say, and Mr. Berlusconi has begun to acknowledge the seriousness of the dangers facing the country after a phone conversation with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Sunday.

Today, Mr. Berlusconi “understands the risks objectively because the situation is dramatic,” said Stefano Folli, the chief political columnist for the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.

Mr. Folli and other analysts predicted that the Italian Parliament would rally and pass a 40 billion euro ($56 billion) austerity package that Mr. Tremonti had championed — even if it turns out to be one of the last significant acts of a government running out of political capital.

Last week, Mr. Berlusconi prompted a sell-off in Italian bonds by suggesting that Mr. Tremonti, a longtime political rival and the sole guardian of fiscal prudence in Italy, could be elbowed out of government, imperiling the austerity package, the details of which still remain shrouded in confusion.

“He thinks he’s a genius and everyone else is stupid,” Mr. Berlusconi said of Mr. Tremonti in an interview published on Friday in La Repubblica, the center-left daily. “He is the only minister who is not a team player,” he added.

At the same time, Mr. Tremonti has other problems. Naples prosecutors are seeking the arrest of one of his close advisers, Marco Milanese, a member of Parliament who has been accused of accepting jewelry, cars and other luxury items from an Italian businessman.

Until the accusations were made public, Mr. Tremonti had been staying in an apartment owned by Mr. Milanese. He moved out soon after they surfaced.

Even if Parliament approves the austerity measures in the coming weeks, the scandal around Mr. Tremonti could grow.

“I don’t think he can withstand this scandal — it’s becoming unsustainable,” said Massimo Giannini, the business editor and deputy editor of La Repubblica. “He has too many enemies inside the government.”

In Brussels on Monday, Mrs. Merkel said: “I have firm confidence in the Italian government to approve exactly such a budget — I spoke on the telephone with the Italian prime minister yesterday on precisely this issue — and to signal that Italy feels a duty to consolidation and fighting debt.”

“The euro itself is stable,” she added, “but we have a problem in some countries.”

For Italy, the biggest worry right now is that its fate may rest as much in Athens, Brussels and Berlin as it does in Rome. Only a week ago, it looked as if Greece might be turning a corner on its problems, after the government managed to push through an austerity package and French and German banks worked on ways to help Greece avoid default.

But the plan by banks fell apart over the weekend, and policy makers are at an impasse on how to require contributions from private creditors as part of a second Greek bailout.

“Markets were getting more optimistic, and suddenly they’re saying, ‘My God, this is as bad as it ever was,’ ” said Peter Westaway, the chief European economist at Nomura International and a former Bank of England official. “Now, it looks as if Italy and Spain are going to be involved, too. And that makes the problem an order of magnitude more complicated for policy makers.”

Mr. Westaway cautioned against getting too negative about Italy. For one thing, the austerity being sought is nowhere near as crushing as what Greece is having to take on.

Still, if the crisis were to take hold in Italy, the problems for the euro union would dwarf all others to date. European banks have total claims and potential exposures of $998.7 billion to Italy, more than six times the $162.4 billion exposure they have to Greece, according to Barclays Capital. European banks have $774 billion of exposure to Spain and $532 billion of exposure to Ireland.

In the United States, banks are also more exposed to Italy than to any other euro zone country, to the tune of $269 billion, according to Barclays. American banks’ next biggest exposure is to Spain, with total claims estimated at $179 billion.

But at the end of the day, “If Italy goes, it’s no longer a domino,” said Mr. Gros, the analyst in Brussels. “It’s a brick.”
308 2011-07-12 Dr. Calkins, who has published research papers and poetry, turned to the community of artists and microphilanthropists at Kickstarter.com. Her plea to potential backers on the site: “By contributing to this project you will support a study of this little known species as we examine its behavior and evolution in its natural habitat, a space encroached upon by both urban sprawl and tension surrounding narcotics trafficking.”

Web sites like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo and RocketHub are an increasingly popular way to bankroll creative projects — usually in film, and visual arts. It is not very likely that anyone imagined they would be used to finance scientific research. And it is unclear what problems this odd pairing might beget.

Most crowd funding platforms thrive on transparency and a healthy dose of self-promotion but lack the safeguards and expert assessment of a traditional review process. Instead, money talks: The public decides which projects are worth pursuing by fully financing them. Kickstarter takes a 5 percent cut when those projects meet or exceed their fund-raising goals. When pledges fall short of a goal, donors pay nothing. The money can come from anywhere — the biggest backers of the quail project were ranchers and hunters.

“Both of us had some hesitation,” Dr. Gee said. “We were sort of afraid we’d lose some legitimacy in the eyes of other scientists. It’s not a peer-reviewed process. I was just ready to do anything it took to do my research.”

For Dr. Calkins and Dr. Gee, who received their Ph.D.’s in 2001 and 2003, respectively, crowd funding is just one more way to scrape together a patchwork of funding and incremental bits of research aimed at larger goals. “I have had to be opportunistic about keeping my research going,” Dr. Gee wrote in an e-mail. “I collect data guerrilla style — when and where I can! I think my story is typical.”

Ten years ago, Andrea Gaggioli wanted to conduct research on virtual reality and neural rehabilitation. But, he said, “in it’s almost impossible to get funded if you are under 30.”

Now 37 and a and technology researcher at Catholic University of , Dr. Gaggioli talks to anyone who will listen about his Open Genius Project, a crowd funding initiative he hopes will provide seed money for breakthrough research. Dr. Gaggioli plans to set up a peer review process to “separate garbage from good science.” But his crowd funding dream itself needs funds before it can begin accepting proposals.

“I think people will invest in projects that are carried out by young people who have no other possibilities to put forward their ideas,” Dr. Gaggioli said.

Cancer Research UK, a -based charity, took a Web page from the site Kiva when it started its MyProjects initiative in September 2008. “The basic premise was to let people choose which cancers they want to beat,” said Ryan Bromley, the charity’s online communities manager.

In the crowd funding genus, MyProjects is a different species from Kickstarter. All projects on the site have been vetted by scientists and already receive financing from Research UK. And the funds are guaranteed regardless of whether the MyProjects goal is reached. Mr. Bromley calls it “substitutional funding.”

“We’re trying to attract people to fund-raise in a different way that we haven’t done before,” he said.

The £818,450 ($1.3 million) that MyProjects has raised since 2008 is a tiny fraction of the £334 million ($534 million) the parent charity gave to cancer researchers in the 2009-10 fiscal year alone. There are currently 28 projects on the site, with an emphasis on the most common cancers: breast, lung and prostate. But the site is continuing to adapt and grow.

“We’re using social media as much as possible,” Mr. Bromley said. The MyProjects page has been “liked” by more than 75,000 people. The site has videos of patients’ success stories as well as researchers. Science is a point of interest, Mr. Bromley said, but the human element is “a bit more motivating than the science alone.”

It’s too soon to tell how widespread science crowd funding will become. Would a geology project on organic sedimentary rocks, for example, open as many wallets as the charismatic quail?

“It starts when one person in a community proposes a project,” said Yancey Strickler, a founder of Kickstarter, “and then all of a sudden they start seeing proposals from five others in that community.” That chain reaction appears to have begun at Evergreen, a public liberal arts college.

The success of the Calkins-Gee quail project inspired Alison Styring, a member of Evergreen’s environmental studies faculty, to submit a Kickstarter proposal titled “Mapping the Bornean Soundscape.” “It’s getting harder and harder to get funding,” said Dr. Styring, who hopes to raise $15,000 to record the sounds of Tawau Hills Park in Malaysian Borneo and study birds there.

Saddled with a busy teaching schedule, Dr. Styring was writing student evaluations in January when the last National Science Foundation grant deadline came and went. Relatively low-cost field projects like hers, she said, are not typically financed by the foundation. But Dr. Styring was not sure if crowd funding would work for her or what rewards to offer as an incentive to potential donors. “Maybe musicians could use the sounds,” she said.

In addition to T-shirts and trading cards, Dr. Calkins and Dr. Gee offered postcards for donations of $5, quail leg bands for $10, pre-ordered signed copies of “The Quail Diaries” for $35, prints for $45, illustrations for $75, adopting and naming a quail for $100, and a guided tour of California quail for $500. “What we found was the majority of people pledged for the book,” Dr. Calkins said.

The quail project was one of thousands that Cassie Marketos, a community editor at Kickstarter, has approved. “It’s one thing to buy a book about quails,” she said. “But to know that you played a small part in making it happen is a much different experience.”
309 2011-07-12 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 151.44 points, or 1.20 percent, to 12,505.76. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 24.31 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,319.49. The Nasdaq composite lost 57.19 points, or 2.00 percent, to 2,802.62.

Even after Monday’s losses, however, the Nasdaq and the Dow still rose about 1 percent since July 1, while the S.& P. was slightly lower.

On the broader market in the United States, financial shares were down almost 3 percent, while energy and materials indexes were lower by more than 2 percent.

Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said rise connected with the events in the euro zone was putting downward pressure on oil prices, which in turn was affecting energy stocks. “Everything is revolving around right now in some way,” he said.

As risk aversion stepped up on Monday, United States Treasuries were trading higher. The euro fell to $1.4027 from $1.4204.

The ’s benchmark 10-year note rose 28/32, to 101 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.92 percent, from 3.03 percent late Friday.

“Global issues are still outstanding,” said Jason Arnold, a financial analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “Markets were still digesting the jobs numbers from Friday, so I think that it is also a factor.” Asian markets, in particular, reacted to the United States government report that just 18,000 jobs were added in June.

In Europe, the Milan Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent on Monday. The FTSE in was down 1.03 percent, the CAC in was down 2.71 percent and the DAX in was down 2.33 percent.

Another weight on sentiment was the report over the weekend that inflation in had reached a three-year high.

“It is kind of like this cocktail of disappointing information and data,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for Russell Investments.

William J. Schultz, chief officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates, said that the debt ceiling talks and euro zone problems in particular “put this tone” to the market.

But he and other market analysts are pinning their hopes on the coming corporate reporting season for the second quarter.

“Those things are weighing, and now the hope is we are going to get earnings surprises on the positive side,” he said.

315 2011-07-13 Issue Medicare spending is expected to increase to $970 billion in 2021, from $520 billion in 2010. Officials have said that the program, which provides health care to people 65 and older, is not sustainable in its current form.

What the Democrats say Mr. Obama has offered to slow the growth of Medicare spending, possibly by as much as hundreds of billions of dollars over 12 years and more than $1 trillion in the following decade, by leveraging Medicare’s buying power. But he has not provided details. Many Democrats see Medicare cuts as undermining their political case against the House Republican plan to turn it into a “voucher” program.

What the Republicans say Earlier this year, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin proposed a plan to give future beneficiaries a fixed amount of money to buy private insurance. On Tuesday, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia presented 27 proposals that he said would save up to $353 billion over 10 years. They include charging co-payments for laboratory tests and home health care, and increasing charges to high-income beneficiaries.

326 2011-07-13 Israel opened the traditional baptism site of Jesus to daily visits on Tuesday, a move that required the removal of mines in the West Bank along the Jordanian border. The site is one of the most important in Christianity. Until now, it had not been regularly open to the public since Israel captured the site and the rest of the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war. Palestinian officials said the move was illegal and called it part of “Israel’s monopoly over our historic and touristic resources.”
327 2011-07-13 Four United States missile strikes in northwestern Pakistan in less than 24 hours killed at least 42 people, Pakistani intelligence officials said Tuesday. The attacks indicate the White House has no intention of stopping its drone program even though the attacks have caused tension with Pakistan. The United States refuses to publicly acknowledge the drone attacks, but officials have said privately that the strikes have killed senior officials for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
328 2011-07-13 President Obama’s top immigration enforcer, John Morton, recently instructed his officials to take mitigating factors into account, like an immigrant’s family ties in the United States and education status, when deciding which deportation cases to pursue. It was not a major breakthrough, but it was sensible and humane, which is why it drew the ire of Representative Lamar Smith, who thinks Mr. Obama is too soft on illegal immigrants.

Mr. Smith, who heads the House Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday introduced a bill to suspend the executive branch’s ability to use discretion in immigration cases. He would not suspend it for every president, just this one.

In a memo to colleagues, he said his proposed law would expire at the end of Mr. Obama’s term, when it would “restore these powers to the next president whom the American people elect — on January 22, 2013.”

The idea behind the discretion is that immigration officials cannot go after everybody, so it makes sense to focus resources on people worth worrying about, like drug dealers, gang members and violent criminals. This is standard practice everywhere in law enforcement.

Without this authority, the administration would be barred from deferring the removal of people who it decides should be low priorities on the deportation list. They could be stable members of their communities, with citizens in their families; or students brought here as children by their parents. They could be temporarily stuck here because their home countries were devastated by natural disasters.

Back in 1999, Mr. Smith was one of several members of Congress who wrote the attorney general and the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, arguing that “unfair” deportations had caused “unjustifiable hardship” for otherwise law-abiding immigrants who had jobs and families and close citizen relatives. “True hardship cases call for the exercise of discretion,” the letter said.
329 2011-07-13 “The Werewolf organization, a network of Nazi saboteurs who would fight to create a Fourth Reich in the event Hitler’s empire crumbled, were to leave tins of instant coffee powder and other foods laced with toxins where they could be found by British and American soldiers,” The Daily Mail of London wrote, describing the declassified dossier.

Four German spies captured after they parachuted into in 1945, including one woman, spilled some of the assassination plots. Female agents were given purse mirrors with microbes hidden inside them, so they might infect top Allied occupiers with deadly bacteria.

British military officials at the time considered the agents’ stories “somewhat fantastic,” but were worried enough to prohibit “the eating of German food or the of German cigarettes” by advancing Allied troops.

A new book, “Amazing Dogs,” by Dr. Jan Bondeson, a senior lecturer at Cardiff University School of Medicine in , reveals that Hitler supported a German school that tried to teach large, muscular mastiffs to “talk” to humans. This story set off a panting spate of “Heel Hitler,” “Furred Reich,” “Wooffan SS” and “Arf Wiedersehen” headlines in British tabloids and plenty of claims that Hitler was “barking mad.”

“There were some very strange experiments going on in wartime , with regard to dog-human communication,” Bondeson writes, wondering: “Were the Nazis trying to develop a breed of super-intelligent canine storm troopers, capable of communicating with their human masters of the Herrenvolk?”

He discovered a 1943 Nazi magazine piece about the headmistress of the canine school, a Frau Schmitt, claiming that some of the dogs spoke a few words. “At a Nazi study course, a talking dog was once asked ‘Who is Adolf Hitler?’ and replied ‘Mein Führer!” Bondeson writes of these claims, noting that “the Nazis, who had such conspicuous disregard for human rights, felt more strongly about the animals.”

Nazi propaganda dwelled on Hitler as a dog lover. He owned two German shepherds named Bella and Blondi. He tested a cyanide capsule on Blondi and killed her just before he committed suicide.

The Nazis took their dogs seriously. As The Guardian reported in January, the Nazi government was so furious about a dog in that had been trained to imitate Hitler with a Nazi salute that the foreign office in started “an obsessive campaign” to destroy its owner.

Bondeson writes that in Germany in the early 20th century, some people had a strong belief in the potential of super-intelligent animals. He said that along with and Hermann Hesse, an Airedale terrier named Rolf was considered one of the leading German intellectuals of the time. Rolf’s owner said she taught him his own alphabet with a system of taps of his paw on a board and, Bondeson notes drolly, “he successfully dabbled in mathematics, ethics, religion and philosophy.”

The latest wacky Hitler story comes from the British author Graeme Donald. He says that, while researching a military book, he stumbled across a story that Hitler and Heinrich Himmler were so worried about German soldiers’ getting sexual diseases from French hookers that they cooked up a plan for soldiers to carry small blow-up blond, blue-eyed dolls called “gynoids” in their backpacks to use as sex “comforters.”

Donald said Himmler ordered 50 dolls but the soldiers were too embarrassed to carry them. “In the end the idea fizzled out,” Donald told The Sun, “and the place where they were made and all the dolls were destroyed in the bombing of .”
330 2011-07-13 The News Corporation moved on Tuesday to reverse the accelerating drop in its stock price, announcing a program to repurchase $5 billion in shares.

Since last week, when a phone-hacking scandal involving one of the company’s British tabloids was revealed to be far more widespread than previously known, the company’s stock lost about 15 percent of its value. Investors, nervous that the widening controversy would imperil the company’s bid to acquire the parts of British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, that it does not already own, have dumped shares over the last several days.

The announcement of the stock repurchase had only a fleeting positive effect on the News Corporation’s share price. While the price rose early in the day, it closed at $15.35, down almost 1 percent. The News Corporation had $11.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of March, money that it had planned to put toward the purchase of BSkyB, a satellite company. It already owns just under 40 percent of BSkyB but last year it bid for the remainder. The deal is a centerpiece of the its efforts to expand.

[On Wednesday, the News Corporation announced it was withdrawing its $12 billion bid, just hours before Britain's Parliament was to approve a cross-party call that it do so.]

The drop in share price has brought new attention to the management of the company. The News Corporation is already facing an amended shareholder lawsuit from some institutional investors that alleges it should have known about the phone hacking at the tabloid, The News of the World, at the time it happened and failed to take action.

Alan Gould, a managing director with Evercore Partners, a research firm, said the repurchase would probably benefit the News Corporation as it weathers a rough period. “Returning cash to shareholders is almost always a good idea, especially when the stock has been hit as much as News Corp. has and appears as cheap as News Corp. is,” he said. “It’s a good use of cash.”
331 2011-07-13 Orr Barouch scored twice and the host Chicago Fire routed the Red Bulls, 4-0, in a U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal match on Tuesday night.

332 2011-07-13 Thanks in large part to its four-year-old streaming service, Netflix has more than 20 million customers in the United States. The company expects that as broadband speeds become faster and TV sets get connected to the Internet, it can become an even bigger player in streaming video.

But it has to manage the transition from DVDs to digital movies and shows carefully. Under the terms announced Tuesday, the streaming-only service will continue to cost $8 a month; a separate DVD-only service will also cost $8 a month for one DVD at a time or $12 a month for two.

For current Netflix customers, the price changes will take effect in September, but for new customers, they took effect Tuesday.

The new pricing is a big change from last November, when Netflix started selling its streaming service for $8 a month and offering one DVD at a time for an additional $2. At that time “we didn’t anticipate offering DVD-only plans,” Jessie Becker, vice president of marketing, wrote Tuesday in a blog post.

As Netflix knows well, the DVD business has been in decline for years as consumers have moved to the Web. But since November, Netflix has realized “there is still a very large continuing demand for DVDs both from our existing members as well as nonmembers,” Ms. Becker wrote. To keep the DVD service alive, the company evidently needs more than $2 a month.

“Netflix must be pretty comfortable with the value of both services that they can break each out,” said John Blackledge, an analyst at Credit Suisse Securities. “At the same time, increasing the price for DVD-and-streaming customers may push more people into streaming-only plans.”

Netflix also said Tuesday that Andy Rendich, its chief service and operations officer, would lead a new, separate management team in charge of the physical DVD service. That team will free other executives to think only about streaming.

IHS Screen Digest expects Netflix to serve up over a billion streams of movies and TV shows this year, almost double last year’s total; and perhaps more important for Netflix, it expects the costs of acquiring those movies and TV shows to double. It estimates that Netflix spent $400 million on licenses for streaming last year.

But what it is spending is not enough for movie aficionados who expect new releases right away and who are disappointed by the glaring absences in the company’s online library. Last month, in a reminder that Netflix is vulnerable to decisions made by Hollywood studios, more than 200 films from Sony Pictures were pulled from the streaming service because of what Netflix called a “temporary contract issue” with Starz, a partner of Sony. The issue has not yet been resolved.

Some Netflix streaming customers depend on the DVD-by-mail add-on because certain blockbuster movies are available much faster that way. If the customers move away from the DVD-by-mail service en masse, two potential beneficiaries are cable and satellite companies that rent movies on demand for a premium and vending machine operators like Redbox that charge lower prices for single DVD rentals.

Shelia Haupt, of Lehighton, Pa., was already considering dropping Netflix; after learning of the price increase, she said, “I’m definitely canceling.”

“Netflix’s streaming video selection is horrible,” Ms. Haupt said. “What I can get on demand from my cable company is so much better.”

She said she was pondering ordering HBO instead because it costs about the same as Netflix.

Some customers took the price changes in stride; Roger Ebert, the movie reviewer, told his followers on Twitter that he would opt for the streaming-only service for $8 a month.

Others reminded their friends of the bad old days of Blockbuster, as if to say, "Remember how far technology has come." Seth Werkheiser, an organizer of bike tours in New York City, wrote in a Twitter message, “Hey kids, remember when you had to put clothes on and drive to the video store?”
333 2011-07-13 And then there is Mr. Beason’s leading role in the blockbuster public corruption trial unfolding this summer in . As part of a federal investigation into accusations that casino operators tried to buy lawmakers’ votes for a bill, Mr. Beason wore a concealed recording device throughout the spring of 2010.

And on those recordings, it was revealed in court, Mr. Beason disparages fellow Republicans and has some derogatory conversations about blacks, whom he at one point refers to as “aborigines.” It left an impressively bipartisan trail of bad blood.

Mr. Beason does not come off, in conversation, as a bomb thrower. In a phone interview from , where he and his family are on vacation, he said he was surprised by the intensity of the recent attention.

Though he said he could not comment on the trial, he attributed a lot of the rancor to people who have misconstrued his statements or positions, intentionally in some cases. The positions themselves he is not apologizing for.

“I don’t mind standing up against anybody on my principles and my beliefs,” he said.

This may sound rather grand, but even his political opponents acknowledge that Mr. Beason is sincere.

“Scott very much has a core belief system that he really works for,” said Patricia Todd, a Democratic state representative who is openly gay and avowedly liberal. “I disagree with him,” she said. But, she added, “I respect him.”

His opponents also grant that Mr. Beason, who has a reputation as a dogged campaigner, truly represents the politics of his district, part of which lies here in the Birmingham suburbs of northern Jefferson County. The district is for the most part white, middle-class and deeply conservative.

Patriotism and social issues like are more important to the voters here than Republican leaders often realize, said Mr. Beason, and special breaks for corporations are just as aggravating to them as government programs for the poor.

“I don’t think that they necessarily understand that the majority of our voters care about big issues,” he said of his party, which he has been bucking for as long as he has pursued a career in politics.

In 1994, just a few years out of college, Mr. Beason ran for State Senate, challenging a Republican veteran. He lost.

A dozen years later, after two terms in the House, he ran against that same veteran and won. The Republicans were still in the minority, however, and his stands, at times as a lone dissenter, did not mean all that much. Some even wondered if he was becoming another career politician: in 2007, he voted for a 62 percent pay raise for lawmakers, arguing that it opened up the legislature to middle-class citizens.

But in 2010, the Republicans took over the Senate for the first time in more than a century, and Mr. Beason was made chairman of the rules committee, one of the most powerful positions in the state. Pushing his agenda now was more than just posturing.

“Being in the majority is much more difficult than being in the minority and just saying ‘You guys are wrong,’ ” Mr. Beason said. “You’ve got to be much more careful.”

His emphasis on carefulness would undoubtedly raise some eyebrows in Jefferson County.

In April, the county’s occupational tax, which represented about 44 percent of its uncommitted general revenue, was declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court on technicalities. The new, majority Republican County Commission turned to the Legislature for help, setting off a fiscal showdown that had more than a few echoes of the debt-ceiling debate in Washington.

Democrats blocked one proposal to redirect tax revenue that currently goes to the indigent care fund. Another plan, to allow the county to levy taxes to replace some of the lost revenue, passed the House.

It never came up for a vote in the Senate; Mr. Beason contested it until the session ended. Nearly 550 layoffs followed, about a quarter of the work force. Courthouses were closed. Maintenance on county roads and bridges came to a halt. The Sheriff’s Department went to a 32-hour workweek, prompting the angry comment from Sheriff . Such cuts will become permanent if new revenue is not found.

Mr. Beason acknowledged that the cuts were tough, but he said the county needed to learn to become more efficient. He urged the county to use the $75 million it has in reserve, a move the county strongly resists because that is its only fail-safe — it is unable to issue any debt. “They’re not going to change unless they have to change,” he said.

In parts of Jefferson County this is a popular stance, as the county government has not exactly instilled trust in the past (several former commissioners went to prison). But many county residents, whether they lost jobs or are now facing lengthy waits for basic services, were fuming, and they were not the only ones.

Jefferson County is $4.5 billion in debt and on the knife edge of bankruptcy. Those who have a stake in that debt took away the unsettling lesson that Alabama’s Legislature was willing to risk their on political grounds.

Matt Fabian, the managing director for Municipal Market Advisors, said that for years there has been a mutual understanding among investors, bond issuers and politicians that contracts and debts would be honored, no matter what it took. The rise of Mr. Beason and other anti-tax hawks has threatened that understanding, he said.

“He is the embodiment of that trend that we worry about,” said Mr. Fabian, who has been advising investors to be wary of buying any Alabama debt.

In the end, Mr. Beason’s biggest liability may rise from his attempt in the casino case, as he described it on the witness stand, to “do whatever I could to help get the bad guys.” Already irked that he wore a wire in closed caucus meetings, some Republicans say that the fallout has seriously jeopardized his leadership of the rules committee, not to mention his future political ambitions.

Mr. Beason acknowledged that “a lot of discussions” will have to take place with his fellow Republicans when the trial is over.

“I think he’s endangered himself as far as statewide office is concerned,” said William Stewart, emeritus professor of political science at the . Professor Stewart points out that Mr. Beason is still popular in his district, and it is reflected in interviews here, where for some, his enemies list is a selling point. But whether Mr. Beason can stick with his approach all the way to Washington is less certain.

“He’s too much of a loner,” Professor Stewart said.
334 2011-07-13 In a bankruptcy court filing on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Dodgers laid out some of their finances through the end of the season, including what they owe in payroll, what they must pay into the Major League Baseball revenue-sharing pool and the schedule of payments from a short-term loan they need to stay afloat.

According to the document, salaries due Friday total $10.7 million, with $10.3 million due July 29. Players are paid every two weeks, and the filing shows the projected payments through Sept. 30. It does not say if the salaries paid are only for players or for a larger swath of Dodgers employees.

On July 29, the Dodgers are to pay $4 million in revenue sharing; $5.5 million more is due Sept. 23.

The filing also shows how the team will draw on $150 million in interim financing that is at the heart of a hearing in bankruptcy court in Delaware on July 22. The Dodgers have received $60 million from a proposed $150 million short-term loan from Highbridge Capital Management. But M.L.B. is also offering $150 million at what it says are better terms. The Dodgers have rebuffed the proposal, saying it would give baseball too much control. A judge will re-examine the lending proposals at the hearing.

The Dodgers project they will receive $25 million from the interim financing on July 22, a total of $25 million over three consecutive weeks in August, $10 million on Sept. 16 and $30 million on Sept. 30.
335 2011-07-13 And finally there is George A. Papandreou, who was 10 when the picture was shot and was trying his best to replicate the grave mien of his elders. Now 59 and the prime minister voted into office in October 2009 after the debt crisis arrived, he is being forced to impose an austerity regime that could well reverse many of the social gains won by his father.

On Tuesday, European finance ministers meeting in were unable for a second straight day to resolve key issues that stand in the way of a second bailout package for Greece.Many political insiders in question whether the current prime minister has the drive and communication skills to sell the public on the need for the cuts that the financial leaders of are demanding. But Nick contends that his brother is up to the task.

Prime Minister Papandreou declined a request for an interview to discuss his father’s legacy and Greece’s current problems.

As events play out here, it is almost as if the Papandreou family’s tale could have been written by Sophocles, the master of ancient Greek tragedy. Like the best tragedies, it is rich in ambiguity.

Was Andreas Papandreou, who died in 1996 after a third term of office, a Socialist firebrand who used government spending to expand the ranks of the Greek middle class and give Greeks a greater sense of pride and confidence?

Or was he a scandal-prone demagogue whose notion of the Greek state as a limitless — and ultimately unaffordable — jobs bank largely explains the country’s near-bankrupt condition today?

Somewhat curiously, Athens lacks even a single statue or monument commemorating Andreas Papandreou. (The Andreas G. Papandreou Foundation, overseen by Nick, is supported largely by money and private contributions.)

And on one of the few times that his son George mentioned his name in public, it was to cite a warning that Andreas made in the early 1990s: “Either we make the debt disappear, or the debt will make the country disappear.”

It was the right-leaning New Democracy party, not the Socialists, who engaged in Greece’s final debt binge, which culminated in 2008 and 2009 with the discovery that the New Democracy party had hidden the true scale of Greece’s obligations. That revelation, which helped sweep George and his Pasok party into power, started the current .

But there is little dispute that the borrowing spree began under Andreas.

Nick Papandreou recalls with a shake of his head the heady days of people power in the early 1980s, when his father opened up the government: the owner of a diner in New York became the tourism minister, a plumber was appointed to run a government shipping post, and students were encouraged to appoint their own professors.

“Yes, the debt went up, but there was a benefit,” said Mr. Papandreou, who has written frequently about his father and the Papandreou family. “There were hospitals and health care for everyone,” he said. “People moved up, income- and hope-wise.”

But in today’s Athens — engulfed in protests, fear and alienation — it is not difficult to find people who pin the blame for their current woes on Andreas.

“Andreas Papandreou,” said Jason Manolopoulos, a hedge fund manager and author of a book on Greece’s economic collapse, “corrupted the Greek psyche and gave to Greeks an entitlement culture based on their existence and not on their ability to work and take risks.”

Nick, George and their two younger siblings, a brother and a sister, came of age in , , and because of their father’s many years as a prominent economist and political activist outside of Greece. In his writings, Nick describes his father as distant, largely absent and even abusive on occasion.

But his father’s life, Nick contends, was stoked by the furies of conflict, passion and above all a supreme ability to reach the Greek people.

George could not be more different, with a character that is more diffident and that lacks the thrusting ambition of his father, Nick says. “He told me many times that he did not want to be prime minister.”

George, a child of the 1960s and even more of an idealist than his father, in Nick’s view, seeks consensus where his father sought conflict. “If you want to get psychoanalytical,” Nick said, “kids with missing fathers want to be liked. And wanting to be liked means there is no conflict. And if you don’t like conflict, then it is difficult to give orders.”

Still, Nick says his brother can do what Greece now needs.

“Andreas might have sold it better initially,” he said. “But he might also have said, ‘Oh my God, these people are losing their jobs.’ George will not yield on these reforms.”

Others are not so sure.

George Papandreou’s reticence — so at odds with his father’s personality — has probably drawn the sharpest criticism from political insiders here.

A view has taken hold that the prime minister lacks the desire to execute the hugely ambitious economic changes demanded by the and the European Union.

Some people also question whether he has the communication skills — as with Nick, Greek is his second language — to explain to a revolting populace why the country can no longer afford to maintain the state that his father built.

“Andreas had a capacity to sense the public mood — there was always the feeling that he was the people’s guy in power,” said Louka T. Katseli, a close political ally of Andreas Papandreou. Ms. Katseli was the economic minister under George Papandreou until she lost her job during a recent government shuffle.

Alluding to the crowds of angry protesters now camping out in front of the Greek Parliament, Ms. Katseli added: “The perception now is that we are detached from voters and society — we have not been able to explain to the people what we have done.”

But not everyone who worked closely with Andreas Papandreou remembers his reign so fondly. One is Theodore Stathis, who worked closely with the elder Papandreou in the 1960s and was a member of Mr. Papandreou’s governments in the 1980s and 1990s.

Mr. Stathis recalls the days of excess in the 1980s, when minimum wages almost doubled and the government pushed itself into nearly every corner of Greek society.

“He wanted to build a state with better salaries and services,” Mr. Stathis said. “But in the end the money just went into the bureaucracy and not to the people. In fact, we built up such a large state that we had to keep borrowing just to pay its expenses. This was a terrible mistake.”

Mr. Stathis left government in the mid-1990s and now works for a small financial company here. He has occasional contact with the current prime minister — most recently last year when he visited the family compound in Kastri outside of Athens to give a speech on the anniversary of Andreas’s death.

He said he told George Papandreou that if he just explained in simple but blunt language that the state could no longer afford to employ so many, the people would understand. Yes, it would be hard, but what choice was there?

“You cannot sacrifice the majority of the people outside government for the few inside government who are keeping their jobs,” Mr. Stathis said, his voice rising. “Politicians can be afraid. I know this. But if you tell people the truth, they will listen and they will see the results.”

So what would Andreas have done?

But Mr. Stathis said that by 1993, in Andreas Papandreou’s third term, state coffers were dry and Mr. Papandreou had begun to accept that the state could not live on borrowing alone. It is an acceptance, Mr. Stathis said, that the current prime minister has been too slow to grasp.

“George is an honest and ethical person,” he said, picking his words carefully. “But he has lost time. Andreas would have seen this earlier and he would have moved quicker with bolder measures.”
336 2011-07-13 Zachary Golper, who baked bread and pastries for Le Bec-Fin in Philadelphia, and his wife, Kate Wheatcroft, have had New York in their sights for some time. “The best people are here,” Ms. Wheatcroft said.

For their bakery, Bien Cuit, they found a space in Brooklyn with a nice brick wall, and room to install a marble counter and an open kitchen, where Mr. Golper can be seen baking handsome, crusty loaves, all well burnished, or bien cuit, as they say in France. The breads come big and small, and many have raisins, garlic and nuts. The ovens are also turning out sweet and savory tarts, croissants and cookies.

Bien Cuit, 120 Smith Street (Dean Street), Boerum Hill, Brooklyn; (718) 852-0200; web.biencuit.com. Breads are $8 to $13; breakfast pastries, $3.75 to $4.50; and tarts, $4.50 to $7.
337 2011-07-13 Takeout shops and restaurants around the city will gladly pack a lunch or supper to enjoy in the park. Perfect Picnic, a new store on the Lower East Side, is dedicated to assembling food for an outdoor feast.

Wendy Weston (pictured) and Colleen Goujjane, a co-owner of One If By Land Two If By Sea restaurant in Greenwich Village, specialize in finding local sources for the food that goes into their lightweight sacks. Salumeria Biellese, Brooklyn Cured, Brooklyn Brine, D. P. Chutney Collective, Kors d’Oeuvres spreads, Beth’s Farm Kitchen and Cricket Creek cheeses are a few of them, from a growing list.

A big fresh baguette, water, utensils and a light tablecloth are included. And what will happen when picnic season is over? “We hope to do gift baskets,” Ms. Weston said. “We’re already getting inquiries from hotels and some corporate clients.”

Perfect Picnic, 9 Clinton Street (Houston Street), (212) 228-2884, perfectpicnicnyc.com. The basic picnic, enough for two people and called the Classic, is $28. Various foods, sold à la carte, like salamis, spreads, cheeses and condiments, are mostly $5 to $13.99 and come in larger quantities than what is included in the picnic bag. Delivery is available, and it’s free from 14th to Canal Streets.
338 2011-07-13 Mr. Walsh plans for half of Diageo’s sales to come from developing economies within the next four years. Diageo, which also makes Guinness and Ciroc vodka, generated 32 percent of sales from these markets in 2010.

To achieve that goal, Mr. Walsh says he plans to shift investments from the mature markets of Europe and the United States to the faster-growing regions.

“I need fewer sales people in Greece, and I need more sales people in Asia and Latin America,” he said, sitting in his office, the shelves of which are lined with special editions of Diageo brands, including Shanghai White, a baijiu-infused vodka it sells in Hong Kong and Macao.

Diageo’s profit rose 1.5 percent, to £1.63 billion, or about $2.6 billion, in 2010 from £1.61 billion a year earlier as growing demand for spirits in China and Latin America and for beer in Africa made up for slower growth in the United States and Europe.

Sales in the nine months that ended on March 31 fell 3 percent in Europe, as many consumers in Greece and Ireland stayed home rather than go to restaurants or bars.

Some analysts said Diageo’s push into Asia was long overdue because its French rival, Pernod Ricard, the world’s second-largest liquor company, had been quickly gaining market share there and had started to challenge Diageo’s No. 1 position. But with about £2 billion cash in hand, Diageo has a larger war chest for acquisitions than Pernod Ricard, which owns Absolut Vodka.

Still, acquisitions in developing markets can be complex, which the baijiu deal showed. They also are few and far between and sometimes expensive, analysts said.

“The level of competition is intensifying and the level of investment you have to make is high,” said Matthew Webb, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove in London. “It’s a good opportunity, but it’s not without risks.”

Local spirit brands in Asia were too small or unattractive for companies like Diageo seven years ago, Mr. Walsh said. Yet as disposable incomes among Asian households grow, so do local brands. “In these new markets there are no huge businesses to buy,” he said. “But I want to see more of these local deals.”

Diageo is now in takeover discussions with the family that owns Jose Cuervo, the world’s biggest tequila brand, that could be worth $2 billion. Diageo already distributes Cuervo.

Any deal would add to an already busy year for takeovers. In its largest deal since it bought some Seagram brands in 2000, Diageo agreed to pay $2.1 billion for the Turkish distiller Mey Icki in February. A month earlier, Diageo bought a 23.6 percent stake in Halico, one of the biggest spirits producers in Vietnam.

In June, the company took a 50 percent controlling stake in the Guatemalan rum producer Zacapa.

Some analysts said Diageo could also bid for Fortune Brand’s Jim Beam bourbon label to increase its market share in the United States. Mr. Walsh did not rule it out and said Diageo was being careful not to let its footprint in the United States diminish. But he said as far as acquisitions were concerned, his attention was now on emerging markets.

“They realize that they put too many costs behind the mature markets and that they have the finances to participate in acquisitions and investments again,” said Laetitia Delaye, an analyst at Kepler in Paris. “It’s a new turning point.”

The shift would also be reflected in Mr. Walsh’s travel schedule. Instead of doing short trips abroad, he says he plans to spend a month at a time in Singapore, Mexico and other faster-growing economies. “I’m keen to spend more time there,” he said.

Diageo was created in 1997 through the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, though many of its brands, including Johnnie Walker, are more than 100 years old. Diageo, a combination of the Latin word for day and the Greek word for world, went on to sell food businesses it inherited from Grand Metropolitan, like Burger King, to focus on spirits and beer.

Diageo started to step up its marketing and distribution investments outside its British and Irish home markets in 2004. Last year, marketing spending in Asia, Latin America and Africa increased by 15 percent compared with just 2.7 percent in North America and Europe.

Part of its marketing efforts is the Johnnie Walker House in Shanghai, which Diageo opened in May to promote the scotch brand in China, where it lags Pernod’s Chivas Regal. Visitors to the restored $3.2 million villa, which once belonged to Mao’s tutor, can relax surrounded by walls made of peat, a kind of turf that is burned to give scotch its smoky flavor, and floors made of straightened whiskey barrels.

Mr. Walsh, whose favorite drinks are Johnnie Walker and Guinness, says he hopes to open more Johnnie Walker houses soon. But he says he is equally excited about the growth prospects for rum.

“Rum is becoming a more discerning product,” he said. “It has a lot to offer and appeals to those who find Johnnie Walker too much. It has this little risqué Latin feel.”
339 2011-07-13 “In Defense of Antidepressants,” by Peter D. Kramer (Sunday Review, July 10), reflects a high-stakes battle involving pharmaceutical companies, health care providers and patients.

Billions in profits are at stake for the drug industry, which has sometimes suppressed negative data about antidepressants. Doctors have financial incentives to treat depression pharmacologically because quick medication evaluations can be more profitable than more time-consuming psychotherapeutic treatment. And then there are some practitioners wedded to psychological treatments who are eager to debunk the supposed superiority of pharmacologic treatment in part to expand their own practices.

While this battle rages, we must not lose sight of the patient. The arguments are complex, and a clear answer to whether antidepressants will work for an individual patient is often not easy to find. The data used and analyzed in the various studies — highly sophisticated and often not comparable — are not easy for patients or even practitioners to decipher.

What is a patient to do?

I would suggest to those suffering from depression that they find a provider who is willing to listen, asks probing questions about how well they are responding, spends an appropriate amount of time, is willing to switch course if they don’t improve, and is even willing to consult with another expert colleague. Fortunately many patients will improve over time.

340 2011-07-13 Through the first nine months of the current fiscal year, fewer than 7,000 Iraqis have been admitted to the United States. In March, just seven were admitted on a so-called special immigrant visa — a class established by Congress to quickly move Iraqis in danger for having helped the American government — and in April, just nine. In some months last year more than 200 arrived on such visas.

The logjam has put numerous Iraqis, like the Aeisa family, in a potentially dangerous bind.

Their story is a common one: a brother was kidnapped and tortured, and the children were bullied in the schoolyard, accused of being spies even by the principal.

Last month they received the phone call they thought would never come. Their visa applications were approved, and they would soon be on their way to .

The father quit his job at Zain, a cellphone company, the children left school, the television, furniture and air-conditioner were sold, and the remaining belongings were packed up. The family of five took up temporary residence in a friend’s storage room.

The week before the flight, another phone call came, this time with bad news. The departure was delayed indefinitely and without explanation.

“It hurts me even more than all the threats we received,” said the father, who asked to be identified only as Abu Hassan for security reasons. “We were expecting, ‘This is it.’ ” The mother, who asked to be identified as Umm Hassan, whose brother and father worked for the American military and now live in Arizona, said only, “I feel sick.”

, who worked for the in Falluja in 2005 and then founded The List Project, a nonprofit group that aids Iraqis who worked for American-affiliated organizations, said, “Basically, I think where there’s a way to stall the program, there’s a will to do it.”

Congress required the Pentagon and the Departments of State and Homeland Security to draft a plan to expedite visas for the most pressing cases, should insurgents threaten those left behind after the military leaves, and set a deadline of May that was not met.

Meanwhile, neither the Bush nor the Obama administration has met the targets set by Congress several years for issuing special immigrant visas.

The numbers are stark: beginning in 2008, Congress expanded the special immigrant visa program to allot 25,000 slots over five years. After nearly four years, the government has issued about 7,000.

Mr. Johnson said the impetus for the legislation was to avoid a huge refugee crisis like the one after the pullout from . In 2006, after British forces pulled out of Basra, the southern Iraqi port city, interpreters were rounded up and killed.

In an interview in Baghdad in May, Eric P. Schwartz, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, said the administration would take care of the Iraqis who had assisted the American forces. “We feel that we are prepared to deal with any variety of contingencies,” he said.

Many thousands of Iraqis worked as interpreters for the American military, translating not just words but the cultural folkways of a land most soldiers knew nothing about.

Maj. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, the top military spokesman here, said of his interpreters over the years: “We were in a lot of hairy stuff together. So you get a bond with these guys that’s incredible.”

Like many officers, he helped an interpreter from a previous tour navigate the bureaucracy of resettlement. Asked about the process, he said: “He got there. It took a long time.”

Another former interpreter of his recently saw him on Iraqi television and contacted him. “He got captured by and was held for about seven months and was tortured,” General Buchanan said.

The American government never kept track of how many Iraqis it employed. “50,000? 100,000? 120,000? Who knows?” Mr. Johnson said .

The government also never accounted for how many Iraqi employees were killed or wounded. But it is clear hundreds have died, and many more have been wounded. A database kept by Titan, a contractor that provided interpreters, was leaked and subsequently published in ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism. For the period between 2003 and 2008, the document showed nearly 300 deaths of interpreters hired by Titan.

Now, with the military leaving, many of those who survived, or still work for the Americans, feel abandoned and betrayed by a government they risked their lives for, by serving on the front lines for a cause they believed in.

is not as violent as it once was, but Iraqis are still threatened for their work with the Americans. Ghaith Baban, 34, works for U.S.A.I.D. and spent May in hiding after he found a note in his garage that cited the Koran and threatened his life for “collaborating with the U.S.” He first applied for resettlement in early 2009 and is still waiting.

When the military leaves, he said, “it’s going to be the worst time for those people who worked for the Americans.”

Meanwhile, the Aeisa family waits for its promised flight to Arizona. The family never initially intended to leave. When relatives who worked for the American military left for the United States, the Aeisa family thought the threats would end. They didn’t. The family’s pit bull, Spider, was killed. A note was left: “Leave, traitors. You are spies for the Americans.” The family moved several times.

“We would have wanted to stay,” said Umm Hassan, the mother. “We had a farm, we had a normal family. All of our dreams were destroyed.”
341 2011-07-13 After it was published, his already strained relationship with the authorities worsened. He was barred from traveling to literary festivals in Germany, Australia and the United States, and was forced last spring to sign a vow to cease publishing outside China. Breaking the pledge, he was warned cryptically, would bring even greater torment.

Given the predicament of his friend Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and writer who is serving an 11-year sentence for subversion, Mr. Liao knew what might await him. The threat gained greater urgency with the impending publication in the United States of “God Is Red,” a book by Mr. Liao about Chinese Christians, and a memoir about his time in jail, “The Witness of the 4th of June.” The memoir, whose title refers to the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, has been delayed several times by skittish publishers in Germany and Taiwan.

His most recent travails are part of a wholesale stifling of creative expression and dissent by the ruling Communist Party. Rattled by turmoil in the Arab world, the government began cracking down on scores of activists and rights lawyers in February. The most prominent victim has been Ai Weiwei, the caustic artist and social critic.

“I think Liao Yiwu’s decision to leave really reflects the extreme unease that writers in China are facing right now,” said Larry Siems, the director of international programs at the PEN American Center, an advocacy group. “It’s a shame, because he is one of China’s most interesting writers, and he has his eyes on some of the great human dramas that accompany China’s emergence as an economic power. China should be unleashing the imagination of its writers instead of trying to restrain and control them.”

The Chinese government has yet to respond to news of his escape. The public security bureau in his hometown would not discuss his case; calls and e-mails to the Chinese Embassy in Berlin were not returned.

Like many of his generation, Mr. Liao has endured a numbing cascade of hardships. He nearly starved to death as an infant during Mao’s disastrous Great Leap Forward, when famine killed more than 20 million people. When he was a child, he and his classmates were forced out of school by the Cultural Revolution, the decade in which education was maligned as a bourgeois indulgence. Much of what he learned came from his father, a teacher of Chinese literature, and his mother, a music instructor.

“As a boy, my dad would make me stand high up on a table and not allow me to come down until I finished reciting the classics,” he said.

As early as 1987, he drew the ire of cultural bureaucrats for poetry, printed in official journals, that was condemned as too pessimistic and anti-establishment. After the Tiananmen crackdown, he experienced the stinging limits on free expression. Inspired by Allen Ginsberg and by Dante’s “Inferno,” he and five friends circulated poems recited on video that lamented the bloodshed in Beijing. Mr. Liao called the piece “Massacre.”

Not long afterward, in 1990, he and the others were jailed as “counterrevolutionaries.” His four years of confinement were characterized by torture and the terror of watching 20 inmates be dragged out for execution. Twice, he said, he tried to kill himself.

But it was in jail that Mr. Liao met many of the characters who would fill “The Corpse Walker.” It was also where he learned to play the xiao, an ancient flutelike instrument that sustained him as a street musician during long bouts of joblessness after his release. Those were bitter years, he said, when friends and even his wife found him politically radioactive.

“I never imagined they would distance themselves from me as if I were the plague,” he said. “From this, I concluded that people’s memories can be easily erased.”

Since then, Mr. Liao has devoted himself to collecting the memories of people on the margins of society. For “God Is Red,” he sought out Christians in rural Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces who had endured years of official persecution.

Mickey Maudlin, the executive editor of HarperOne, described it as refreshingly devoid of polemics. “Liao isn’t trying to score ideological points,” Mr. Maudlin said by phone from San Francisco. “He’s just trying to describe how people survived in an environment that is not very friendly.”

Mr. Liao said that since he reached Germany, he has been too overwhelmed and excited to eat or sleep much. Having arrived with no money, he is relying on the generosity of friends, his German publisher and, he hopes, royalties from his forthcoming books. He speaks neither German nor English, and said he was unsure whether to plunge into learning a new language.

“Germany, the U.S. and Australia have all welcomed me,” he said. “But the place I really want to be is China.”
342 2011-07-13 A parliamentary committee said Tuesday that it would call Mr. Murdoch, his son James and , the chief executive of News International, to testify next week about accusations of phone hacking and corruption at the News International papers. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said it would seek to determine “how high up the chain” knowledge of the newsroom malpractices in the Murdoch newspapers went.

New and alarming charges came on Tuesday from the former prime minister , who said that one of the most prestigious newspapers in the group, The Sunday Times, employed “known criminals” to gather personal information on his bank account, legal files and affairs.

Those charges centered on suggestions that The Sunday Times and The Sun, a Murdoch tabloid, used subterfuge to learn in 2006 that Mr. Brown’s infant son, Fraser, had , a fact that generated a Sun scoop.

The two papers responded with statements denying wrongdoing. The Sun said it had not accessed the child’s medical records and did not “commission anyone to do so.” Instead, it said, the article originated “from a member of the public whose family has also experienced cystic fibrosis.”

“He came to The Sun with this information voluntarily, because he wanted to highlight the cause of those afflicted by the disease,” the newspaper said.

The Sunday Times said it had “pursued the story in the public interest” and had followed Britain’s press code “on using subterfuge.” “No law was broken in the process of this investigation,” it said.

A separate parliamentary committee investigating years of indecisive police investigations into The News of the World’s rampant phone-hacking operations spent hours on Tuesday grilling police officers who led the inquiries.

Some of the most humbling moments for the police came as members of the Home Affairs Committee demanded to know why John Yates, the head of the police’s counterterrorism force, spent only one day in a formal review of an earlier investigation before concluding in 2009 that there was nothing more to it. At one point a committee member, Steve McCabe, said, “You just don’t seem like the dogged, determined sleuth that we would expect.”

That was followed by the committee chairman, Keith Vaz, rebuking Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original investigation from 2005 to 2007 but is now retired: “All this sounds more like Clouseau than Columbo.”

Mr. Hayman acknowledged that he had private dinners with journalists from The News of the World during the investigation. When he defended that by saying that to “have turned it down would have been potentially more suspicious than to have it,” peals of laughter erupted in the hearing room.

The most startling revelation may have been the scope of the new police investigation, covering many more potential victims than the 4,000 previously said to have been identified in the notes of one of the men jailed in 2007. Sue Akers, the top Scotland Yard officer assigned to take over the inquiry this year, said that her team had lists of 3,870 names, 5,000 land-line phone numbers and 4,000 cellphone numbers. So far, she said, only 170 people had been formally notified that their phones may have been hacked.

The hearing next week could be a make-or-break moment for the Murdochs and Ms. Brooks. The committee they will face has been asked by Ofcom, the media regulator, to judge whether they are “fit and proper” to run BSkyB, Britain’s most lucrative satellite television network.

Mr. Brown’s accusations against The Sunday Times signaled that the scandal would not be confined to the tabloid papers in the group. “I’m shocked, I’m genuinely shocked, to find that this happened, because of their links with criminals, known criminals, who were undertaking this activity, hired by investigators working with The Sunday Times,” Mr. Brown said.

He added, “I just can’t understand this — if I, with all the protection and all the defenses and all the security that a chancellor of the Exchequer or a prime minister has, am so vulnerable to unscrupulous tactics, unlawful tactics, methods that have been used in the way we have found, what about the ordinary citizen?”

Mr. Brown said that he and his wife, Sarah, were “in tears” when they were told by Ms. Brooks, then the editor of The Sun, that the paper was going to publish an article about their son Fraser’s condition, which the couple had not discussed with anyone except the boy’s medical care providers.

Although News International contended in its statement that The Sun had obtained legitimately the information about the boy’s medical condition and that it did not look at his medical records, Mr. Brown was skeptical.

“They will have to explain themselves,” he said. “I can’t think of any way that the medical condition of a child can be put into the public arena legitimately unless the doctor makes a statement or the family makes a statement.”

356 2011-07-14 SANDWICH, England — No matter how bright Rory McIlroy’s present and future might be, the British Open will not be heading to Northern Ireland anytime soon.

The longer term is a different matter.

“I don’t think it’s something that’s going to be in any way imminent, but it’s certainly something we’ll have a look at again in view of the success of the golfers from that part of the world,” said Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient, golf’s governing body in much of the world.

Though hardly a promise, that does sound like an opening, and if the Open Championship — as they call it in Britain — ever does return to Northern Ireland, the most likely site remains the Dunluce Links at Royal Portrush Golf Club.

Long considered one of the top courses — links or otherwise — in the world, Royal Portrush staged the only Open held out of Scotland or England. That was in 1951, and the Englishman Max Faulkner was the winner, holding the lead he grabbed during the second round.

Political and commercial concerns have prevented a repeat until now, but momentum is clearly building with the success of McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, the Northern Irishmen who have now won major championships.
357 2011-07-14 “When I learned Ant Man wouldn’t be able to work this week, I thought of Andy,” Baddeley said. “I’ve known him for quite a few years and I’ve gotten on very good with him. I knew he was a local boy and that he’d won here last time with Ben, and when he was available and my guy couldn’t make it, I was like, that’d be perfect.”

The temporary arrangement does not have to be perfect to be successful. Baddeley would just need to make it to the weekend to improve his Open record of 0 for 5 in cuts made.

Even if Baddeley were to win this weekend, it would be far less surprising than what happened in 2003, when Curtis — ranked 396th in the world, playing in his first Open and winless on the PGA Tour — won here.

In the final round, Curtis birdied six of the first 11 holes to take the lead, then won despite bogeying four holes coming in because Thomas Bjorn played the final four holes four over par.

Baddeley said he had been enjoying the work he has done this week, had been hitting his irons well and tightening up his short game. He said he and Sutton seem to have meshed well since they began working together Saturday.

“It’s been good,” Baddeley said. “He’s really just shown me around the place, given me the lines to hit off the tees. Growing up around links golf, he really understands the idea of how the ball can roll out a long way, so it’s good.”

This will be the third Open that Sutton has worked at St. George’s — he also caddied for Joakim Haeggman, who missed the cut in 1993 — and he also occasionally plays the course on a reciprocal arrangement with Littlestone Golf Club, where he is a member. Still, he claims no special insights.

“I don’t know this course like the back of my hand at all,” he said. “I mean, I know it just as well as anybody who’s worked here for three Opens.”

Sutton knows it well enough to be a steadying influence for Baddeley, a guide through the 7,211-yard minefield of blind shots, severe greens, bumps and hollows that make St. George’s such a difficult Open course.

He knows the lines from each tee in every kind of wind. He knows the movements of the fairways and the breaks on the greens, and he is candid about the peculiarities and difficulty of the course.

“It’s pretty unique,” Sutton said. “A lot of people don’t like it. And it’s a course, because of the blind shots, you need to get good lines and trust those lines. You’ve got some courses that are just great on the eye. Every tee, it looks like an inviting tee shot, inviting second shot. This is the complete opposite. Nothing looks inviting off the tee.”

In just a few days of working together, Baddeley and Sutton have built a bond of trust on some unusual club selections. The 14th at St. George’s is a 547-yard par 5 that can be a three-shot hole or reachable in two, depending on wind direction.

“On Sunday, Aaron hit driver, 2-iron, 9-iron, into the wind,” Sutton said. “Yesterday we hit a 5-iron off the tee and a 6-iron into the green. In 23 years caddying, I can’t think of a par 5 that’s been 5-iron, 6-iron.”

When Baddeley goes to the first tee, Sutton will remind him that the left edge of the bunker some 440 yards in the distance is the line to take to drive the ball into the center of the fairway.

“That’s all you can see there,” Sutton said. “A bit of that bunker over 400 yards away. There’s no other definition at all. It can’t be confidence inspiring to be standing there, not quite seeing edges of the fairways. It can probably drain your confidence a bit.”

It would do a lot more than that if Baddeley were unsure where the line is. That local knowledge, and a lot more, could make a big difference this week.
358 2011-07-14 Both the N.C.A.A. and Auburn acknowledged last year that Newton’s father, Cecil, had offered his son’s services to Mississippi State for $180,000. Cam Newton told the N.C.A.A. that he had no knowledge of the proposed transaction. Soon after, in a controversial decision, the N.C.A.A. declared him eligible to play the rest of the season. He went on to lead Auburn to the national title and win the Heisman Trophy. He now awaits his new role as quarterback for the Carolina Panthers.

Auburn, the N.C.A.A. and the SEC declined comment on the exchange at the SEC gathering.

While Chizik has repeatedly said that he and Auburn did not break any rules in recruiting Newton, Roe Lach made it clear that the N.C.A.A. is not done investigating.

“Obviously, I think that she was serious, and I obviously thought it was a good message, because you could tell that she and they are serious about what they’re doing and trying to do what they have to do to clean up some of the bad elements in college athletics,” said Vanderbilt Coach Kevin Stallings, one of four SEC basketball coaches who confirmed the exchange.

The exchange between Chizik and Roe Lach provided another example of the N.C.A.A.’s more vigorous emphasis on enforcement. The N.C.A.A. has increased and restructured its enforcement staff recently in an attempt to better handle its caseload.

“It was obvious they were trying to be thorough,” said Stallings, who was with other basketball coaches at a recruiting event. “It was obvious they wanted everyone to know that there’s a more diligent pursuit than there’s been in the past. The staff is bigger and more aggressive. I thought that her message was a good one.”

Arkansas’s basketball coach, Mike Anderson, said there was a visceral reaction in the room to Chizik’s questioning, with coaches shrugging their shoulders and looking perplexed.

Mississippi’s basketball coach, Andy Kennedy, said that he believed Chizik “was trying to get some finality to when the process was over, and it was an interesting debate, to say the least.”

“I think the format of the meeting was set up to be generally about the lay of the land going forward,” Kennedy continued. “When he got into specific questions regarding their situation, I think we were all sitting back saying, ‘I didn’t know that we were going here.’ ”

Kennedy said Roe Lach gave general answers at first, but Chizik’s persistence forced her into a bigger statement — that the N.C.A.A. was still investigating Auburn.

“I’m not sure she wanted it to be that way,” Kennedy said. “I’m speculating, but it seemed like a situation where she was like, ‘Do I go left or do I go right here?’ ”

Scandals have defined college sports in the last calendar year, from the North Carolina agent investigation to the Newton situation and recent problems at Ohio State and Oregon. Along with those recent cases, Southern California’s 2004 national championship was vacated.

Coaches say they see a tangible push from the N.C.A.A. to fight back. “The message that the N.C.A.A. is sending is, ‘Enough already,’ ” L.S.U.’s basketball coach, Trent Johnson, said.
359 2011-07-14 Rupert Murdoch’s political influence may be surpassed by his impact on the value of the News Corporation. The stock routinely trades more cheaply than media rivals’, largely because the company, which is listed in the United States, is run at Mr. Murdoch’s whim. As a result of the British phone-hacking scandal, the Murdoch discount has widened to 30 percent.

The affair forced the News Corporation to shutter The News of the World, its most widely read newspaper, and led the company to withdraw a $14 billion plan to buy full ownership of the British pay-TV operator BSkyB. The damage could extend further. Senator Jay Rockefeller, for instance, has called on Congress to open an investigation that would accompany those in Britain.

The News Corporation enterprise now trades at a paltry five times estimates of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year 2012, according to Credit Suisse. That’s 40 percent less than media groups like Walt Disney and Time Warner — double the typical gap seen since 2002.

The most valuable component of the empire is its American cable networks, including Fox News. Put their combined Ebitda, as estimated by Barclays Capital, on a multiple of nine and they’re worth more than $30 billion. The movie studio behind the global blockbuster “Avatar” and the Fox broadcast network, home to hit shows like “American Idol” and “Glee,” together should be worth more than $12 billion.

The publishing arm at the heart of News Corporation’s troubles warrants a lower multiple of four, between those of Trinity Mirror of Britain and The New York Times, for a value just above $5 billion. The Sky Italia satellite unit and various private stakes add more than $6 billion, and holdings in publicly traded companies bring another $10 billion-plus, three-quarters of which is accounted for by News Corporation’s 39 percent stake in BSkyB.
360 2011-07-14 ON hot, sticky days, there’s something reassuring about having a bottle opener close at hand: you will not be locked out of liquid refreshment. But a distinctive opener goes beyond the mechanics of removing bottle caps, adding something extra to summer festivities.

That’s one reason Brian McAllister created his own: the Hex Opener, a hefty stick of solid brass in a hexagonal shape, with a notch at one end for prying off caps.

“It’s very basic,” said Mr. McAllister, who runs the Seattle product design firm Iacoli & McAllister with his partner, Jamie Iacoli. “A study in removal, really, with just one opening.”

Still, the weight makes it satisfying to hold. Over the Fourth of July weekend, he said, “We had a couple of barbecues, and it certainly saw quite a bit of use.”

The bottle opener’s minimal aesthetic is representative of Iacoli & McAllister’s larger body of work, which includes clean-lined light fixtures, tables and jewelry. “We’re really inspired by the basic principles of design,” Ms. Iacoli said, like proportions, color and texture. “We both look for the essence of things.”

With that mix of function and simplicity in mind, Mr. McAllister and Ms. Iacoli set out to find other appealing bottle openers in Seattle. As selective shoppers, however, they had a hard time finding much of anything they liked.

362 2011-07-14 Prices of goods imported to the United States fell in June for the first time in a year as oil and food expenses retreated, the Labor Department said Wednesday.

The 0.5 percent fall in the import-price index followed a revised 0.1 percent gain in May, the figures showed. Economists projected a 0.6 percent decrease for June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices excluding petroleum fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since July 2010.

“The drop is really reflective of what we’re expecting for the second half of the year with weaker energy and food prices,” said David Semmens, a United States economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “This really feeds into the transitory story that you’ve been hearing from the Fed.”

Compared with a year earlier, import prices rose 13.9 percent, the biggest 12-month advance since August 2008, the report showed.

The cost of imported petroleum fell 1.6 percent from the previous month, the largest one-month drop since June 2010. Even with the decrease, the cost was still up 50 percent from a year earlier.
363 2011-07-14 Navigon is also on Apple ($50, with unlimited traffic data for an added $20), but I preferred TomTom U.S.A. ($50, with traffic data for $20 a year).

Apple users who have no worries about data limits or cell connections should consider Garmin StreetPilot ($35, including traffic data). On Android, CoPilot Live Standard is a more refined alternative to Google Maps Navigation.

Before downloading these apps, though, buy a mounting bracket and a car charger. The bracket can be found for $10 to $20 and will save you from fumbling with the device. The charger will prevent the more power-hungry mobile navigators from draining the battery.

Once you’re properly set up, find the right app. For many Android users, Google Maps, which comes installed on most Android devices, is the only navigation assistant they’ll need.

Type an address into the Google Maps search box, or speak the address or the business name. When the destination appears on a map, tap its icon and choose “directions” from the options.

The directions are narrated by a computerized voice that you wouldn’t want to hear at a poetry reading, but it works fine for navigation. The graphics are sometimes exceptional. When you’re at an intersection and you tap the “street view” button, the screen shows a panoramic photo of the area, with arrows indicating the route.

The software also stores your directions and local map data in case you lose your network connection midtrip.

And Google Maps shows traffic data. While navigating, tap on the “Layers” icon and choose “Traffic,” and the map shows roads with green, yellow or red markings, depending on traffic flow. In my testing, this feature was fairly reliable — which is to say roughly as reliable as the traffic feature on the other apps I tried. It flagged some rush-hour traffic and beach traffic, for instance, but at other times it missed long stretches of bumper-to-bumper congestion.

Apple users who are looking for a free option have nothing quite as extensive as Google Maps, but Mapquest 4 Mobile is decent. Like Google Maps, it includes turn-by-turn navigation and traffic data. But the search function and graphics were less comprehensive and more cramped, and the software was slower than Google Maps.

Users who chafe at these shortcomings should try MotionX GPS Drive. With a main menu bursting with the choices, the interface takes a little getting used to, but once you understand the logic, it’s easy to use and filled with useful features.

For example, you can find your compass heading, locate parking along your route and search Wikipedia entries for roadside attractions. But when I missed a turn, MotionX was slower than some other navigational apps at finding a new route.

Budget-wise, it is a big leap to the next tier of navigational aids, but expensive apps from TomTom, Magellan and Navigon are generally worth the money. They can take as long as a half-hour to download, because the software includes all the map data for the entire country. After that, though, they work like traditional navigation devices. Type the first few letters of a town or a street, for instance, and eligible choices appear. These apps also load directions more quickly than the cheaper versions.

For Apple devices, I found TomTom most useful. To my eye, the interface was more refined and simpler than the others. The software routed me around traffic more intelligently, too, and it showed more relevant traffic data. Magellan RoadMate USA 2.0 ($50, with traffic data and future updates included) is very good, though, and unlike TomTom it has no added subscription charges.

Navigon is quite good, too, but it had one bizarre flaw that existed on none of the other apps I tested. When giving audible directions as users approach a turn, it didn’t say the name of the street. It merely said “turn left,” or “turn right.”

In complicated intersections and highway interchanges, this forces drivers to squint at the phone to see the name of the road, rather than watching the road. (I tried following the verbal directions blindly, but this led to multiple wrong turns.) If Navigon ever sees fit to include street names, I will use nothing else on my Droid. Otherwise, I’ll use it when I have a passenger to help read the screen.

When driving alone, I’ll use TomTom on my iPhone and Google Maps or CoPilot Live on my Droid. They consume more data or they’re not as pretty or versatile, but at least I won’t run anyone off the road while reading text on my phone.

Photosynth, the free and exceedingly entertaining panoramic photo app for Apple devices, is newly updated. Users can now e-mail their photos to friends, among other things. ... The latest wallpaper app to make waves on Android is My Beach HD ($1). Daytime ocean views yield to nighttime fireworks (among other options).
364 2011-07-14 Danielle Chiesi, convicted of insider trading as part of the case against the Galleon Group hedge fund, agreed to pay $540,000 to settle related allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition to her liability for $500,000 in principal and $40,535 in interest, Ms. Chiesi agreed not to violate S.E.C. rules prohibiting her from engaging in fraudulent or deceptive practices including insider trading.

Ms. Chiesi, 45, who was an analyst at New Castle Funds, and Mark Kurland, New Castle’s co-founder, both pleaded guilty in connection with a government investigation of hedge fund insider trading centered on Galleon and its co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam.

The S.E.C. first sued Mr. Rajaratnam, Ms. Chiesi, Mr. Kurland and three other people in October 2009. Her agreement resolves allegations contained in a revised complaint filed last year.

Ms. Chiesi’s lawyer, Alan R. Kaufman, on Wednesday declined to comment. On Jan. 19, Ms. Chiesi pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy, telling United States District Judge Richard J. Holwell that she was “deeply ashamed” of what she had done.

Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of 37 to 46 months when she is sentenced on July 20.

Mr. Kurland, 62, is serving his sentence in Otisville, N.Y. according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Web site.
365 2011-07-14 “The master narrative of immigration reform is being crafted around the notion of unscrupulous employers seeking cheap labor,” said Craig Regelbrugge, a lawyer and lobbyist with the American Nursery and Landscape Association.

Unscrupulous employers exist, Mr. Regelbrugge said, but more often he sees business owners who are just trying to follow the law. When a new hire produces seemingly legitimate forms of documentation required by the I-9 form, the employer must accept them. (To refuse could expose the owner to charges of employment discrimination.) “The employer is not required to be a forensics expert,” said Monte Lake, an immigration lawyer in Washington.

The upshot of the more aggressive enforcement is that even employers who have followed the rules can be devastated by an audit that compels them to fire valuable, long-time employees.

The I-9 audit of Mr. Cox’s nursery revealed that 26 of his 99 employees were not authorized to work in the United States. Because ICE determined he had acted reasonably in hiring them, Mr. Cox was not fined or held criminally liable. But after confirming that the 26 employees could not produce authentic documents, he was forced to fire them. All had been with him for five to 10 years, and he lost half of his budding crew, a highly specialized team that grafts trees. “Telling them was probably the worst day of my life,” he said. “I don’t just sit at a desk here, I’m actually out in the field harvesting with them.”

Mr. Cox said he was lucky the audit hit midrecession, after he had already reduced his work force and inventory. Still, he estimates that his 2009 expenses climbed 10 percent as a result of the terminations. And, despite California’s high unemployment rate, finding replacement employees has proved challenging. “I’ve gone through more workers this year than I have in the past 10 years combined,” Mr. Cox said.

While most such workers earn the $8-an-hour minimum wage in California, Mr. Cox said he generally paid $8.90 an hour for a 50-hour week. The terminated budding crew workers made $10 an hour. Compensation includes state-mandated overtime of time and a half, health insurance and two weeks’ paid vacation. “If I raised the wage,” he said, “I’d have to shut my doors.”

Meanwhile, after an audit, ICE does not round up the affected workers for deportation. That meant Mr. Cox’s former workers were free to seek employment elsewhere — including with his competitors. Mr. Cox said that he knew through his remaining workers that the terminated employees were all working in the area.

After the audit, Mr. Cox started using E-Verify, a federal program that lets employers confirm the authenticity of a job applicant’s Social Security and green card numbers electronically. Although the program’s use is mandatory in some states, its reliability has been debated, and it remains voluntary in California. A bill in Congress that would require all American employers to use the program could go to a vote this month.

The owner of another agricultural business, this one on the East Coast, requested anonymity because he was currently undergoing an I-9 audit that had resulted in the loss of half of his work force. He said the employees he was forced to terminate were 25 to 40 years old and had been in the United States for five to 10 years. Many were raising children born here. “They’re all staying here and working for someone else,” he said.

After the terminations, the East Coast owner said he was struggling to get replacement workers up to speed. He has endured a substantial increase in customer complaints — to 30 a week from about three — and has reduced his 2011 sales goals by 15 percent. The terminated employees included members of his management team who earned $12 to $15 an hour. He paid them all their vacation pay, and said he was bothered by the perception that employers like him were unscrupulous and treated undocumented workers unfairly. “We did everything by the book,” he said. “There were a lot of tears here.”

While the human side of the issue is compelling, employers must comply with the law, said Mr. Lake, the immigration lawyer. There is no way to avoid an ICE audit, but establishing and maintaining the right procedures can help you survive one. Mr. Lake recommends that employers review their practices and seek professional assistance if they are not knowledgeable about legal requirements. Sloppy record-keeping can lead to fines for technical violations.

If a review reveals incomplete I-9 forms, employers should fill in the missing information and initial it with the date and time it was added. Mr. Lake advises random checks to ensure that employees are completing the forms. Be sure to retain I-9 forms for the legally required period of time — the longer of three years or one year after the employee leaves the company. Business owners should understand their obligations upon receiving a no-match letter. Mr. Lake advises employers who receive these letters to meet one-on-one with the designated worker to ensure that a clerical error did not cause the confusion, confirming that names are spelled correctly and no numbers have been transposed.

Assuming there is no mistake, Mr. Lake said the owner must instruct the worker to pursue the issue with the Social Security Administration and report back within a “reasonable time.” Document your actions and treat all workers the same, Mr. Lake said. If an employee reports that everything is fine, and you get another no-match letter the next year, you know it is not fine. After that, Mr. Lake said, there is no good answer if ICE conducts an audit and asks, “Why didn’t you take action the second time?”
366 2011-07-14 TOKYO — Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Wednesday that Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy in what would be a radical shift in the country’s energy policy, saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology.

It was Mr. Kan’s strongest stand yet against nuclear energy in the aftermath of the multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was ravaged in the March 11 tsunami and suffered a substantial radiation leak. At least 80,000 people have been evacuated from around the plant, and radioactive materials have been detected in tap water as far away as Tokyo, as well as in agricultural produce like vegetables, tea and beef.

“Japan should aim for a society that does not depend on nuclear energy,” Mr. Kan said at a nationally televised news conference. “We should reduce our dependence in a planned and gradual way, and in the future we should aim to get by with no nuclear energy.”

He added, “When we think of the magnitude of the risks involved with nuclear power, the safety measures we previously conceived are inadequate.”

With his popularity at a record low, however, it is unclear whether Mr. Kan can push through such an extensive overhaul of Japan’s energy policy. Nuclear power made up about 30 percent of the country’s energy needs before the Fukushima accident, and Japan had planned to raise that share to over 50 percent by 2030.

This preliminary prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and we are not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.

This is the initial public offering of our Class A common stock. We are selling 3,462,000 shares of our Class A common stock. We currently expect the initial public offering price to be between $16.00 and $18.00 per share. Concurrent with the closing of this offering, existing investors, including funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures, have agreed to purchase from us in a private placement the number of shares of Class A common stock with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.5 million, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price.

Since Zillows inception, we have had authorized Class A common stock, which has one vote per share, and authorized Class B common stock, which has ten votes per share. All shares of Class B common stock are held by our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink. Following this offering and the concurrent private placement, Mr. Barton will have voting control over approximately 0.2% of our Class A common stock and 55.3% of our Class B common stock, representing 46.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and Mr. Frink will have voting control over approximately 44.7% of our Class B common stock, representing 37.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.

We have granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 519,300 additional shares of Class A common stock to cover over-allotments.

We have applied to list our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol Z.

Investing in our Class A common stock involves risks. See Risk Factors beginning on page 12.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The underwriters expect to deliver the shares to purchasers on or about                     , 2011 through the book-entry facilities of The Depository Trust Company.

You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus or in any free writing prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have not, and the underwriters have not, authorized anyone to provide you with different information. We are not, and the underwriters are not, making an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should not assume that the information contained in this prospectus is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this prospectus.

The following summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that you should consider in making your investment decision. Before investing in our Class A common stock, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes included in this prospectus and the information set forth under the headings Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In this prospectus, unless the context requires otherwise, references to Zillow, our company, we, us and our refer to Zillow, Inc. In addition, in this prospectus, we use the term unique user. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique IP address accesses our website or one of our mobile applications during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our website or mobile applications using different IP addresses within a given month, the first access by each such IP address is counted as a separate unique user.

Our mission is to build the most trusted and vibrant home-related marketplace

to empower consumers with information and tools to make intelligent decisions about homes.

Zillow is the leading real estate information marketplace. We provide vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through our website and mobile applications, enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs. We are transforming the way people make home-related decisions. Zillow provides consumers and real estate professionals an edge in real estate.

We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible. Our living database of more than 100 million U.S. homes  including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market  attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else. These profiles include rich, detailed information about homes, such as property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, both through our website and through our industry-leading mobile applications that allow consumers to access our information when they are curbside, viewing homes.

Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes. Our products and services present residential real estate data in novel ways that have revolutionized the way consumers search for, find and understand home-related information and make real estate decisions.

Consumers increasingly are turning to the Internet and mobile devices for real estate information. During May 2011, 22.0 million unique users visited our website and mobile applications, representing year-over-year growth of 102%. We operate the most popular mobile real estate applications across iPhone, iPad, Android and BlackBerry. During May 2011, Zillow was used on a mobile device more than 8.8 million times, with more than 1.7 million homes viewed on mobile devices each day.

Real estate and mortgage professionals are a critical part of the home-related marketplace. We enable consumers to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs.

Our real estate marketplace benefits from network effects. As more consumers come to our website to use our products and services, more real estate and mortgage professionals contribute content to distinguish themselves, thereby making our marketplace more useful and attracting additional consumers.

We generate revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we generated revenue of $11.3 million, as compared to $5.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 111%. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we generated revenues of $10.6 million, $17.5 million and $30.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 49%, 65% and 74%, respectively.

Homes are the center of peoples lives, the focus of some of their most important decisions and often their most valuable assets. In addition to whether to buy, sell or rent, consumers make many other important home-related decisions throughout their lifetimes, including decisions relating to refinancing or home equity loans, home maintenance and home improvement. Residential real estate is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and supports a large number of professionals that provide home-related services. We believe the following activities represent large market opportunities for Zillow:

Highly Fragmented, Local and Complex Market  The market for residential real estate transactions and home-related services is highly fragmented, local and complex. Each home has unique characteristics, including location, value, size, style, age and condition. Each consumer approaches home-related transactions with a personal set of objectives, priorities and values. Real estate agents generally operate in local markets as independent contractors with different experience and skills. These conditions create challenges for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals alike.

Absence of Consumer Orientation  Historically, consumers had minimal access to comprehensive and objective residential real estate data, even though many home-related decisions are extraordinarily information-intensive. While real estate and mortgage professionals had some data, consumers did not have free, independent and easy access to it. Even when accessible, the data was difficult to interpret and analyze.

Increasing Role of the Internet and Mobile Technologies  Consumers increasingly are turning to the Internet and mobile devices for real estate information. With the widespread adoption of mobile and location-based technologies, consumers expect home-related information to be available on their mobile devices where, when and how they want it.

We are transforming the way consumers make home-related decisions and connect with real estate and mortgage professionals. We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible, and to providing transparency for all market participants. Our living database of homes, our Zestimates and our Rent Zestimates form the foundation of our products and services.

Living Database of Homes  Our dynamic and comprehensive living database includes detailed information on more than 100 million U.S. homes, or most U.S. homes, and includes homes for sale, for rent and recently sold, as well as properties not currently on the market. This database is central to the value we provide to consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals. It contains extensive information that users can search, through an easy-to-use interface, to identify, analyze and compare homes. It includes information such as property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We apply extensive computer analytics to the data and transform it into information that is accessible, understandable and useful. We refer to the database as living because the information is continuously updated by the combination of our proprietary algorithms, synthesis of third-party data from hundreds of sources, and through improvements by us and, importantly, by our community of users.

Zestimates and Rent Zestimates  We have developed industry-leading automated home valuation models that use advanced statistical methods and complex, proprietary algorithms. We use these models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes.

We believe we have the following competitive advantages:

Measuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace revenues depend in part on our ability to enable our users to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals and our display revenues depend in part on the number of impressions delivered. Furthermore, our community of users improves the quality of our living database with their contributions. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique IP address accesses our website or one of our mobile applications during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our website or mobile applications using different IP addresses within a given month, the first access by each such IP address is counted as a separate unique user. We measure unique users with Omniture analytical tools.

Our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks are discussed more fully in the section of this prospectus titled Risk Factors, and include but are not limited to the following:

Zillow, Inc. was incorporated in Washington in December 2004. Our principal executive offices are located at 999 Third Avenue, Suite 4600, Seattle, Washington 98104, and our telephone number is (206) 470-7000. Our website address is www.zillow.com. In addition, we maintain a Facebook page at www.facebook.com/zillow and a twitter feed at www.twitter.com/zillow. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website, Facebook page or twitter feed does not constitute part of this prospectus and inclusions of our website address, Facebook page address and twitter feed address in this prospectus are inactive textual references only.

Zillow, Zillow.com, Zestimate, Make Me Move, and the Zillow logo are registered trademarks of Zillow in the United States and in some other countries. Other trademarks and trade names referred to in this prospectus are the property of their respective owners.

The number of shares outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placement is based on 13,644,750 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2011 and, unless otherwise indicated, excludes:

Except as otherwise indicated, all information in this prospectus assumes and reflects:

Summary Financial and Other Data

The following tables present summary historical financial data for our business. You should read the financial data set forth below in conjunction with the information under Selected Financial and Other Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and related data included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have derived the following statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 from our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have derived the following unaudited statements of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 and the unaudited balance sheet data as of March 31, 2011 from our unaudited financial statements that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our results to be expected in any future period. Pro forma net loss per share attributable to common shareholders has been calculated assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock and the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our Class C common stock into 2,305,980 shares of our Class A common stock, both to be effected upon the effectiveness of the registration of which this prospectus is a part.

The following table sets forth our balance sheet data as of March 31, 2011:

The information below is illustrative only and will be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing.

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed within this prospectus Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented.

An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our Class A common stock. Any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition and our prospects. In addition, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.

We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable over the long term.

Since our inception in December 2004, we have incurred significant net operating losses and, as of March 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $79.5 million. Although we have experienced significant revenue growth, we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the maturation of our business. At the same time, we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial resources to develop and expand our business, including on:

These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business and to manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.

If real estate and mortgage professionals or other advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our business would be harmed.

Our current financial model depends on advertising revenues generated almost entirely through sales to real estate agents and brokerages, mortgage lenders and advertisers in categories relevant to real estate. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and ultimately to generate advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including:

While real estate agents participating in our subscription-based Premier Agent program generally commit to contract terms of six or 12 months, we do not have long-term contracts with most of our other advertisers. Those advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. In addition, as existing subscriptions for our Premier Agent program expire, we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions, securing new subscriptions or increasing the amount of revenue we earn for a given

subscription over time. We may not succeed in capturing a greater share of our advertisers spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness or superiority of our products as compared to alternatives, including traditional offline advertising media such as television and newspapers. If current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our advertising revenues and business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, if we do not realize the benefits we expect from our relationship with Yahoo! Real Estate and other strategic relationships we may enter into, including for example, the generation of additional advertising revenue opportunities, our business could be harmed.

If we do not innovate and provide products and services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers, our business could be harmed.

Our success depends on our continued innovation to provide products and services that make our website and mobile applications useful for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals and attractive to our advertisers. As a result, we must continually invest significant resources in research and development in order to improve the attractiveness and comprehensiveness of our products and services and effectively incorporate new Internet and mobile technologies into them. If we are unable to provide products and services that users, including real estate professionals, want to use, then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to continue offering innovative products and services, we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to increase awareness of the Zillow brand cost-effectively, which could harm our business.

We rely heavily on the Zillow brand, which we believe is a key asset of our company. Awareness and perceived quality and differentiation of the Zillow brand are important aspects of our efforts to attract and expand the number of consumers who use our website and mobile applications. Should the competition for awareness and brand preference increase among online real estate information providers, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance the strength of our brand. If in the future we choose to engage in a paid advertising campaign to further promote the Zillow brand, such efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

We are dependent on the real estate industry, and changes to that industry, or declines in the real estate market or increases in mortgage interest rates, could reduce the demand for our products and services.

Our financial prospects are significantly dependent on real estate shoppers using our services. Real estate shopping patterns depend on the overall health of the real estate market, which has been in decline since 2007. Changes to the regulation of the real estate industry, including mortgage lending, may negatively impact the prevalence of home ownership. Changes to the real estate industry, declines in the real estate market or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce demand for our services. Real estate markets also may be negatively impacted by a significant natural disaster, such as earthquake, fire, flood or other disruption.

We may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listing aggregators, multiple listing services, apartment management companies, home builders and other third-party listing providers, which could limit the information we are able to provide to our users.

Our ability to attract users to our website and mobile applications depends to some degree on providing a robust number of for sale and rental listings. To provide these listings, we maintain relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listing aggregators, multiple listing services, apartment management companies, home builders, other third-party listing providers, and homeowners and their real estate agents to include listing data in our services. Many of our agreements with real estate listing providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated with limited notice. The loss of some of our existing relationships with listing providers, whether due

to termination of agreements or otherwise, or an inability to continue to add new listing providers, may cause our listing data to omit information important to users of our products and services. This could reduce user confidence in the sale and rental data we provide and make us less popular with consumers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with data providers, which could limit the information we are able to provide to our users and impair our ability to attract or retain users.

We obtain real estate data, such as sale transactions, property descriptions, tax-assessed value and property taxes paid, under licenses from third-party data providers. We use this data to enable the development, maintenance and improvement of our information services, including Zestimates and Rent Zestimates and our living database of homes. We have invested significant time and resources to develop proprietary algorithms, valuation models, software and practices to use and improve upon this specific data. We may be unable to renew our licenses with these data providers, or we may be able to do so only on terms that are less favorable to us, which could harm our ability to continue to develop, maintain and improve these information services and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may in the future be subject to disputes regarding the accuracy of our Zestimates and Rent Zestimates.

We provide our users with Zestimate and Rent Zestimate home and rental valuations. A Zestimate is our estimated current market value of a home based on proprietary automated valuation models that apply advanced algorithms to analyze our data; it is not an appraisal. A Rent Zestimate is our estimated current monthly rental price of a home, using similar automated valuation models that we have designed to address the unique attributes of rental homes. Revisions to our automated valuation models, or the algorithms that underlie them, may cause certain Zestimates or Rent Zestimates to vary from our expectations for those Zestimates or Rent Zestimates. In addition, from time to time, users disagree with our Zestimates and Rent Zestimates. Any such variation in Zestimates or Rent Zestimates or disagreements could result in distraction from our business or potentially harm our reputation and could result in legal disputes.

We face competition to attract consumers to our website and mobile applications, which could impair our ability to continue to grow the number of users who use our website and mobile applications, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract additional consumers to our website and mobile applications. Our existing and potential competitors include companies that operate, or could develop, national and local real estate and mortgage websites. These companies could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available, have a more accelerated time frame for deployment and leverage their existing user bases and proprietary technologies to provide products and services that consumers might view as superior to our offerings. Any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract consumers or provide solutions similar to our own but with better branding or marketing resources. If we are unable to continue to grow the number of consumers who use our website and mobile applications, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.

We may be unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We compete to attract advertisers with media sites, including websites dedicated to providing real estate and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals and consumers, and major Internet portals, general search engines and social media sites, as well as other online companies. We also compete for a share of advertisers overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as television, magazines, newspapers and home/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate professionals to advertise their qualifications and listings. Large companies with significant brand

recognition have large numbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic, which may provide a competitive advantage. To compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors, we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products and services. Pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our revenue, and increase our research and development and marketing expenses. If we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors, our business, financial condition or results of operations would be harmed.

Our dedication to making decisions based primarily on the best interests of consumers may cause us to forgo short-term gains.

Our guiding principle is to build our business by making decisions based primarily upon the best interests of consumers, which we believe has been essential to our success in increasing our user growth rate and engagement and has served the long-term interests of our company and our shareholders. In the past, we have forgone, and we will in the future forgo, certain expansion or short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of consumers, even if such decisions negatively impact our results of operations in the short term. In addition, our philosophy of putting consumers first may negatively impact our relationships with our existing or prospective advertisers. This could result in a loss of advertisers which could harm our revenue and results of operations. For example, we believe that some real estate agents have chosen not to purchase our Premier Agent subscriptions because we display a Zestimate on their for sale listings. However, we believe it is valuable to consumers to have access to a valuation starting point on all homes and so we display a Zestimate on every home in our database for which we have sufficient data to produce the Zestimate. Similarly, we gather and make available to our consumers reviews on real estate and mortgage professionals, even if those reviews are unfavorable. Although real estate and mortgage professionals who receive unfavorable reviews may be less likely to purchase our advertising products and services, we continue to post favorable and unfavorable reviews because we believe the reviews are useful to consumers in finding the right professional. Our principle of making decisions based primarily upon the best interests of consumers may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user traffic and engagement, business and results of operations could be harmed.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.

We have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which places substantial demand on management and our operational infrastructure. Most of our employees have been with us for fewer than two years. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. In particular, we intend to pursue strategic opportunities and make substantial investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing organizations. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our services and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business.

If use of the Internet and mobile technology, particularly with respect to online real estate products and services, does not continue to increase as rapidly as we anticipate, our business could be harmed.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued use of the Internet and mobile technology as effective media of business and communication by our consumers. Internet and mobile technology use may not continue to develop at historical rates, and consumers may not continue to use the Internet or mobile technology as media for information exchange. Further, these media may not be accepted as viable long-term outlets for information for a number of reasons, including actual or perceived lack of security of information and possible disruptions of service or connectivity. If consumers begin to access real estate information through other media and we fail to innovate, our business may be negatively impacted.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed.

We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our management and our highly skilled team of employees, including our software engineers, statisticians, marketing professionals and advertising sales staff. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be harmed.

Any significant disruption in service on our website or in our network could damage our reputation and result in a loss of users of our products and services and of advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our brand, reputation and ability to attract users and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our network infrastructure and content delivery processes. We have experienced minor interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed the performance of our website and mobile applications, and we may experience interruptions in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our website and mobile applications and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of users of our products and services and of advertisers and result in additional costs, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Substantially all of the communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our website are located at facilities in the area. We do not own or control the operation of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.

A failure of our systems at one site could result in reduced functionality for our users, and a total failure of our systems could cause our website or mobile applications to be inaccessible. Problems faced by our third-party web hosting providers with the telecommunications network providers with which they contract or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our users. Our third-party web hosting providers could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy reorganization, faced by our third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, this could harm our business.

We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may make acquisitions and investments, which could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.

We expect to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic opportunities. For example, in March 2011, we acquired the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service. Any transactions that we enter into could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:

Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.

We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws that are continuously evolving and developing, including laws regarding the real estate and mortgage industries, Internet-based businesses and businesses that rely on advertising. These laws can be costly to comply with, can require significant management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. These laws may conflict with each other and if we comply with the laws of one jurisdiction, we may find that we are violating laws of another jurisdiction. Additionally, our ability to provide a specific target audience to advertisers is a significant competitive advantage. Any legislation reducing this ability would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.

If we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations, if we become liable under these laws or regulations or if unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies are implemented, we could be directly harmed and forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability and it could cause the development of product or service offerings in affected markets to become impractical. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services, limit our ability to expand our product and services offerings or expand into new markets or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and results of operations.

We assist with the processing of customer credit card transactions which results in us receiving personally identifiable information. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in the United States. This legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information, including credit card information, that is collected, processed and transmitted. We could be

adversely affected if government regulations require us to significantly change our business practices with respect to this type of information.

We may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business, or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.

We have registered domain names for our website that we use in our business, such as Zillow.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, we may incur significant expenses to market our products and services under a new domain name, which could harm our business. In addition, our competitors could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting and enforcing our rights in our domain names and determining the rights of others may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention.

We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and our business.

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, the value of our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that our operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties or that competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications. There also can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable or that our patents will be effective in preventing third parties from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same products or services. Moreover, we rely on intellectual property and technology developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.

Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services may be provided. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could harm our competitive position. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Intellectual property disputes are costly to defend and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

From time to time, we face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We are currently subject to patent infringement claims. These claims allege, among other things, that aspects of our technology infringe upon the plaintiffs patents. If we are not successful in defending ourselves against these claims, we may be required to pay damages and may be subject to

injunctions, each of which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. We may be subject to future claims or allegations relating to our intellectual property rights. As we grow our business and expand our operations we expect that we will continue to be subject to intellectual property claims and allegations. Patent and other intellectual property disputes or litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering certain products, services or features, purchase licenses which may be expensive to procure or modify our products or services. In addition, patent or other intellectual property disputes or litigation may result in significant settlement costs. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

In addition, we use open source software in our services and will continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against companies that incorporate open source software into their products or services, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to changing our products or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.

Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.

In order to protect our technologies and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. To the extent that our employees, contractors or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could harm our business, results of operations, reputation and competitive position.

We may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate our data.

From time to time, third parties have misappropriated our data through website scraping, robots or other means and aggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we have become aware of such websites, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.

If our security measures are compromised, consumers may curtail use of our products and services and advertisers may reduce their advertising on our website.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users information, some of which may be private, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability and litigation. For example, a hacker could steal a users profile password and manipulate information about that users home or post to a forum while posing as that user. Like all websites, our website is vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. If we experience compromises to our security that result in website performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our website, or mobile applications, or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, our users and advertisers may lose trust and confidence in us, and users may decrease the use of our website or stop using our website in its entirety, and advertisers may decrease or stop advertising on our website. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users or advertisers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or our users or advertisers information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new users and increase engagement by existing users, cause existing users to curtail or stop use of our products or services or close their accounts, cause existing advertisers to cancel their contracts, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby harming our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept.

We accept payments through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees would require us to either increase the prices we charge or suffer an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions. If we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if these systems fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult for us to comply. We are required to comply with payment card industry security standards. Failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors. Any failure to comply fully also may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Further, there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, card holders and transactions.

If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our service to offset the increase. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.

We have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure indebtedness.

In March 2011, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to establish a $4.0 million line of credit to be used for general business purposes. Indebtedness we incur under this agreement is secured by substantially all our assets other than our intellectual property. If we default on our obligations under this agreement, the financial institution may foreclose on our assets, which would materially and adversely impact our business. On March 22, 2011, we executed a standby letter of credit of $1.5 million in connection with the lease of our new Seattle offices and reserved this amount against the line of credit, which subsequently reduced the available line to $2.5 million. As of March 31, 2011, there were no other amounts outstanding under the line of credit.

We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis.

Our revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period and may fail to match expectations as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside our control. The other risk factors discussed in this Risk Factors section may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results. In addition, our results may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in the quantity of, and the price at which we are able to sell, our remnant advertising and the size and seasonal variability of our advertisers marketing budgets. As a result of the potential variations in our revenue and results of operations, period-to-period comparisons may not be meaningful and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, our results of operations may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow us, which may adversely affect our stock price.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and this Offering

Our securities have no prior market and an active trading market may not develop, which may cause our Class A common stock to trade at a discount from the initial public offering price.

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. The initial public offering price for our Class A common stock will be determined through negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of the market price of our Class A common stock after this offering. If you purchase shares of our Class A common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial public offering price. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market, or how liquid that market might become. An active public market for our Class A common stock may not develop or be sustained after this offering. If an active public market does not develop or is not sustained, it may cause our Class A common stock to trade at a price lower than the initial public offering price and it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of Class A common stock at a price that is attractive to you.

The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents has the effect of concentrating voting control with our founders, and limits your ability to influence corporate matters.

Since Zillows inception, our capital structure has had authorized Class B common stock and authorized Class A common stock. Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering and the concurrent private placement, has one vote per share. All shares of Class B common stock have been and are held by our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink.

Mr. Barton will have voting control over approximately 19.6%, and Mr. Frink will have voting control over approximately 15.8%, of the aggregate number of shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock following this offering and the concurrent private placement. Mr. Bartons holdings and Mr. Frinks holdings will represent approximately 46.8% and 37.8%, respectively, of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering and the concurrent private placement. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink will have significant control over our management and affairs and will be able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election or removal (with or without cause) of directors and approval of any significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that you, as a shareholder, may otherwise support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our stock price may be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the offering price.

The initial public offering price for the shares of our Class A common stock will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The market price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many of the risk factors discussed in this prospectus, and others beyond our control, including:

Furthermore, the stock markets in recent years have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of the equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. If the market price of our Class A common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the

future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement, based on our shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011, and after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock and Class C common stock into shares of Class A common stock, we will have 17,430,277 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase additional shares and no exercise of outstanding options.

Of the outstanding shares, all of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that (1) any shares held or acquired by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, will be subject to the volume limitations and certain other restrictions of Rule 144 and (2) any shares purchased through the directed share program will be subject to a 180-day lock-up. The shares to be sold in the concurrent private placement are subject to the holding period requirements of Rule 144 and are, therefore, subject to a minimum six-month holding requirement before such shares can be sold in a non-registered transaction. The remaining 13,644,750 shares of Class A common stock outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placement (based on our shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011) and the 323,527 shares sold in the concurrent private placement will be restricted as a result of securities laws, lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions that restrict transfers for at least 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain extensions and subject to certain earlier releases if certain conditions are met. For further information, see Shares Eligible for Future Sale. In addition, Citi may, in its sole discretion, release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements prior to expiration of the lock-up period. After this offering and the concurrent private placement, the holders of 10,523,850 shares of Class A common stock and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock, or 74.4% of our total outstanding Class A common stock (calculated on an as-if-converted basis), based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011, will be entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors rights agreement. If the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to registration rights elect to exercise such rights and sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purposes of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register approximately 6.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2011 Incentive Plan. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market when the options underlying the shares are exercised and the shares of Class A common stock are issued, subject to the lock-up period and other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan, option agreements or lock-up agreements entered into with the option holders.

Because the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock will be substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock following this offering, new investors will experience immediate and substantial dilution.

The initial public offering price per share will be substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A and Class B common stock immediately following this offering and the concurrent private placement based on the total value of our tangible assets less our total liabilities. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus, you will experience immediate dilution of $14.30 per share, the difference between the price per share you pay for our Class A common stock and our pro forma net tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2011, after giving

effect to the issuance of 3,785,527 shares of our Class A common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement. Furthermore, investors purchasing shares of our Class A common stock in this offering will only own approximately 12.8% of our outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock (and have 3.1% of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock), after the offering even though their aggregate investment will represent 38.4% of the total consideration received by us in connection with all initial sales of 26,958,590 shares of our capital stock outstanding as of March 31, 2011, after giving effect to the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement. To the extent outstanding options to purchase our Class A common stock are exercised, investors purchasing our Class A common stock in this offering will experience further dilution.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our company. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If few or no securities or industry analysts cover our company, the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted. If securities or industry analysts cover us and if one or more of such analysts downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts covering us fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decline, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.

Following the completion of this offering, we will be required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and will result in increased costs to us and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These requirements could strain our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Exchange Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join us and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert managements attention from other business concerns and could make it difficult to manage our business, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if we find any material weakness in our internal control, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our management and affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated in connection with this offering, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our

amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws will include provisions, some of which will become effective only after the date, which we refer to as the threshold date, on which the Class B common stock controlled by our founders represents less than 7% of the aggregate number of shares of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, that:

Prior to the threshold date, our directors can be removed with or without cause by holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single group, and vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by such shareholders, voting together as a single group. Given the dual class structure of our common stock, our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, who hold our Class B common stock, will have the ability for the foreseeable future to control these shareholder actions. See the risk factor above titled The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents has the effect of concentrating voting control with our founders and limits your ability to influence corporate matters and the discussion in this prospectus under Description of Capital Stock.

The provisions described above, after the threshold date, may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which prohibits certain business combinations between us and certain significant shareholders unless specified conditions are met. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, even if this change of control would benefit our shareholders. See Description of Capital Stock.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds we receive in this offering and the proceeds we receive in the concurrent private placement, and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment.

Our management will have considerable discretion in applying the net proceeds we receive in this offering and the proceeds we receive in the concurrent private placement. We currently intend to use these proceeds primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. If appropriate opportunities arise, we may use a portion of these proceeds to acquire or invest in technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business. We have not allocated these proceeds for any specific purposes. Until these proceeds are used, we plan to invest them, and these investments may not yield a favorable rate of return. If we do not invest or apply these proceeds in ways that enhance shareholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.

This prospectus, including the sections entitled Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, Use of Proceeds, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business, contains forward-looking statements based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and generally may be identified by terms such as believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, could, would, project, plan, expect or the negative or plural of these words or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Risk Factors. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the effect of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, except as required by law, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning our industry and the market in which we operate, including our general expectations and market position, market opportunity and market size, is based on information from various sources, on assumptions that we have made that are based on those data and other similar sources and on our knowledge of the markets for our products and services. These data involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. Although we believe the data from third-party sources are reliable, we have not independently verified this information. While we believe the market-position, market-opportunity and market-size information included in this prospectus is generally reliable, such information is inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of the Class A common stock in this offering and the proceeds from the concurrent private placement will be approximately $56.8 million, assuming an initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable in connection with this offering. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price would increase (decrease) the net proceeds from this offering by $3.2 million, assuming the number of shares offered, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable in connection with this offering.

The principal purposes of this offering and the concurrent private placement are to increase our financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and, with respect to this offering, create a public market for our Class A common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for these proceeds or the amounts that we plan to use for any particular purpose. Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. However, we currently expect to use these proceeds primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of these proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments. Pending the use of these proceeds, we intend to invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing investments.

We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our capital stock and we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. We therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock or Class B common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determinations to pay dividends on our Class A common stock or Class B common stock would depend on our results of operations, our financial condition and liquidity requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law or our contracts, and any other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. Pursuant to the current terms of our loan and security agreement with a financial institution, we cannot pay dividends unless specified financial covenants are satisfied.

The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and capitalization as of March 31, 2011:

The information below is illustrative only. Our capitalization following this offering and the concurrent private placement will depend on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read this table in conjunction with the sections entitled Selected Financial and Other Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share would increase (decrease) the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, additional paid in capital and total shareholders equity and total capitalization by approximately $3.2 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable in connection with this offering. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 100,000 shares in the number of shares of our Class A common stock offered by us would increase (decrease) the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, additional paid-in capital, total shareholders equity and total capitalization by approximately $1.6 million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable in connection with this offering.

The number of shares in the table above excludes:

If you invest in our Class A common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this offering and the concurrent private placement.

Our pro forma net tangible book value as of March 31, 2011, was $16.0 million or $0.69 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of total tangible assets (total assets less intangible assets, including goodwill) less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2011, after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock and the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our Class C common stock into an aggregate of 2,305,980 shares of our Class A common stock, both to be effected upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

After giving effect to the issuance and sale by us of 3,785,527 shares of our Class A common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement at the assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses payable in connection with this offering, our pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value immediately after this offering and the concurrent private placement would have been $72.9 million, or $2.70 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $2.01 per share to our existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $14.30 per share to our new investors and concurrent private placement investors purchasing shares of Class A common stock.

The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis:

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share would increase (decrease) our pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value as of March 31, 2011 by approximately $3.2 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable in connection with this offering. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price per share would increase (decrease) the pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value per share immediately after this offering and the concurrent private placement and increase (decrease) the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to new investors and concurrent private placement investors by $0.12 and $0.88, respectively, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable in connection with this offering. As such, changes in the resulting pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value per share after this offering and the concurrent private placement and dilution in, pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value per share to new investors and the concurrent private placement investors are not directly proportional to changes in the assumed offering price per share.

The following table sets forth as of March 31, 2011, on a pro forma, as adjusted, basis as described above, the differences between the number of Class A common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us and the average price per share that existing shareholders (including Class B common shareholders) new investors and the concurrent private placement investors paid. The table gives effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into shares of Class A common stock and the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our Class C common stock into shares of our Class A common stock. The calculation below is based on an assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and before deducting any underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable in connection with this offering:

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share would increase (decrease) total consideration paid by new investors purchasing shares in this offering and total consideration paid by all shareholders by $3.2 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remain the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable in connection with this offering.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the number of shares of Class A common stock held by the new investors purchasing shares in this offering will be increased to 3,981,300, or approximately 14.5% of the total number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding after this offering, and our existing shareholders and concurrent private placement investors will own 23,496,590 of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, or approximately 85.5% of the total number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding after this offering.

SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

You should read the financial data set forth below in conjunction with the information under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our results to be expected in any future period. We have derived the following statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 from our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have derived the following unaudited statements of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 and the unaudited balance sheet data as of March 31, 2011 from our unaudited financial statements that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have derived the following statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 and balance sheet data as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 from our audited financial statements not included in this prospectus.

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed within this prospectus Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors.

We are the leading real estate information marketplace. We provide vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through our website and mobile applications, enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs. We are transforming the way consumers make home-related decisions.

Our living database of more than 100 million U.S. homes  homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market  attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else. These profiles include rich detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, both through our website and through our industry-leading mobile applications that enable consumers to access our information when they are curbside, viewing homes. Using industry-leading automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes. Our products and services present residential real estate data in novel ways that have revolutionized the way consumers search for, find and understand home-related information and make real estate decisions.

We were incorporated in December 2004 and have continually introduced innovative products, achieving key product development and business milestones that have driven our revenue and traffic growth.

We generate revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our revenues include marketplace revenues, consisting of subscriptions sold to real estate agents and advertising sold on a cost per click, or CPC, basis to mortgage lenders, and display revenues consisting of advertising placements sold primarily on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis.

We have experienced significant revenue growth over the past three years. In 2008, 2009 and 2010 we focused on growing our marketplace revenues, which accounted for the majority of our revenue growth over that period. This growth in marketplace revenues helped us achieve an overall 70% compound annual growth rate from 2008 to 2010. The increase in marketplace revenues resulted from growth in our Premier Agent program and the commencement of charging mortgage lenders for participation in Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. Our Premier Agent program established a significant source of more predictable subscription-based revenue that complements our display revenues, and created a diversified revenue mix.

In 2008, 2009 and 2010, we generated revenues of $10.6 million, $17.5 million and $30.5 million, respectively, representing growth of 49%, 65% and 74%, respectively. We believe achieving these levels of revenue growth were primarily the result of significant growth in the following areas:

During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we generated revenue of $11.3 million, as compared to $5.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 111%. We believe this increase is primarily the result of an increase in our Premier Agent Subscribers from 3,438 at March 31, 2010 to 10,710 at March 31, 2011, as well as a significant growth in traffic to our website and mobile applications. There were approximately 17.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to 9.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2010, representing year-over-year growth of 86%.

During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we began to recognize revenues related to our strategic relationship with Yahoo! Real Estate. Under this strategic relationship, we provide real estate listings to Yahoo! Real Estate and have exclusive rights to sell real estate agent advertising and certain graphical advertising for display on the Yahoo! Real Estate site. We anticipate this partnership will have a positive impact on our future results of operations, primarily due to an increase in marketplace revenues as we expect the partnership will continue to drive greater demand for our Premier Agent product.

To analyze our business performance, determine financial forecasts and help develop long-term strategic plans, we frequently review the following key growth drivers:

Measuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace revenues depend in part on our ability to enable our users to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals, and our display revenues depend in part

on the number of impressions delivered. Furthermore, our community of users improves the quality of our living database of homes with their contributions. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique IP address accesses our website or one of our mobile applications during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our website or mobile applications using different IP addresses within a given month, the first access by each such IP address is counted as a separate unique user. We measure unique users with Omniture analytical tools.

The number of Premier Agent subscribers is an important driver of revenue growth because each subscribing agent pays us a monthly fee to participate in the program. We define a Premier Agent subscriber as an agent with a paid subscription at the end of a period.

We generate revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our revenues include marketplace revenues and display revenues.

Marketplace Revenues.    Marketplace revenues consist of subscriptions sold to real estate agents under our Premier Agent program and CPC advertising related to our Zillow Mortgage Marketplace sold to mortgage lenders.

Our Premier Agent program allows local real estate agents to establish a persistent online and mobile presence on Zillow in the zip codes they serve. We present contact information for each Premier Agent alongside home profiles and home listings within the agents zip code, assisting consumers in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. Pricing for our Premier Agent subscriptions varies by zip code. Subscription advertising revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which

the advertising is delivered. Typical terms of our Premier Agent subscription contracts range from six to 12 months. Growth in our subscription advertising product is based on our ability to continue to attract agent subscribers and drive consumer traffic to those agents on our website and through our mobile applications.

In Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, participating qualified mortgage lenders make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Zillow Mortgage Marketplace are presented with personalized lender quotes from participating lenders. We only charge mortgage lenders a fee when users click on their links for more information regarding a mortgage loan quote. Mortgage lenders who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace.

Display Revenues.    Display revenues primarily consist of graphical web and mobile advertising sold on a CPM basis to advertisers primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, home builders, mortgage lenders and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. We recognize these revenues as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our website or mobile applications. Growth in display revenues depends on continuing growth in traffic to our website and mobile applications and migration of advertising spend online from traditional broadcast and print media.

Cost of Revenues.    Our cost of revenues consists of expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including associated headcount expenses, such as salaries and benefits and share-based compensation and bonuses. Cost of revenues also includes credit card fees, ad serving costs paid to third parties, revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships and facilities costs allocated on a headcount basis.

Sales and Marketing.    Sales and marketing expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support, marketing and public relations employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities and facilities costs allocated on a headcount basis.

Technology and Development.    Technology and development expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development and testing of our website. Technology and development expenses also include equipment and maintenance costs and facilities costs allocated on a headcount basis. Technology and development expenses also include amortization costs related to capitalized website and development activities and amortization of certain intangibles and other data agreement costs related to the purchase of data used to populate our website.

General and Administrative.    General and administrative expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting and administrative support. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt and facilities costs allocated on a headcount basis.

Other income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes. As of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, we did not have taxable income and, therefore, no tax liability or expense has been recorded in the financial statements. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 and March 31, 2011, because there is significant uncertainty around our ability to realize the deferred tax assets in the future.

We adopted the provisions related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of January 1, 2007, which provide a financial statement recognition and measurement threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The following tables present our results of operations for the periods indicated and as a percentage of total revenue.

Overall revenues increased by $5.9 million, or 111%, for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. Marketplace revenues increased by 271% and display revenues increased by 26%.

Marketplace revenues grew to $6.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, from $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. Marketplace revenues represented 61% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to 35% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase in marketplace revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the number of subscribers in our Premier Agent program from 3,438 as of March 31, 2010 to 10,710 as of March 31, 2011, representing growth of 212%. In addition, we began to recognize revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2011 related to our strategic relationship with Yahoo! Real Estate, which contributed to the increase in Premier Agent subscribers and positively impacted our marketplace revenues for this period.

Display revenues increased from $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 to $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in our unique users, which grew from

9.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2010 to 17.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2011, representing quarter-over-quarter growth of 86%. The growth in unique users increased the number of graphical display impressions available for sale and advertiser demand for graphical display inventory.

Cost of revenues increased by $0.7 million, or 56%, for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase in cost of revenues is attributable to revenue sharing costs related to the strategic partnership with Yahoo! Inc. that launched in February 2011 as well as increases in credit card fees and other costs related to revenue growth.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 76%, for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase is primarily related to growth in headcount related costs of $1.8 million, primarily for our sales team to promote our Premier Agent program and increases in advertising, tradeshows, conferences and related travel expenses of $0.5 million.

Technology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, increased by $0.5 million, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. Approximately $0.3 million of the increase is the result of additional amortization of capitalized website development costs and intangible assets. The remaining increase is primarily the result of growth in headcount-related costs of $0.1 million and a net increase in various other expenses of $0.1 million. Amortization expense included for capitalized website development costs was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense included for purchased data content intangible assets was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Other data agreement expense was $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 36%, for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. The fluctuation was driven by an increase

of $0.4 million in professional services fees, an increase of $0.3 million in headcount-related costs driven by growth in headcount and a $0.4 million increase in various other miscellaneous expenses. The increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in local, business and occupational and gross receipts taxes, the majority of which was the result of a $0.3 million tax credit we received relating to a refund of certain state and local taxes from 2006 to 2009.

Our current headquarters in Seattle, Washington is under an operating lease expiring in February 2013, and we have entered into an operating lease for our new headquarters in Seattle, Washington, under which we will be obligated to make lease payments beginning in December 2012 and expiring in November 2022. We currently expect to vacate our current office space during the second half of 2011, and we are in the process of evaluating sublease opportunities. At the time we vacate our current office space, we may be required to record a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for the remaining term, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.

2009 Compared to 2010.    Overall revenues grew by $13.0 million, or 74%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Marketplace revenues grew by 238% and display revenues grew by 27%.

Marketplace revenues grew from $3.9 million in 2009 to $13.2 million, and represented 43% of total revenues in 2010 compared to 22% of total revenues in 2009. This increase in marketplace revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the number of subscribers in our Premier Agent program from 2,764 as of December 31, 2009 to 8,102 as of December 31, 2010, an increase of 193%. We believe this increase in subscribers in our Premier Agent program was driven by our continued focus on developing our marketplace program and the sales team supporting it, and the overall growth in the number of unique users of our website and mobile applications. Marketplace revenues also increased because we began to charge mortgage lenders for participation in Zillow Mortgage Marketplace in January 2010.

Display revenues increased from $13.6 million in 2009 to $17.2 million in 2010 and represented 57% of total revenues in 2010 compared to 78% of total revenues in 2009. We believe this growth was primarily the result of the increase in our unique users which increased from 7.6 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2009 to 12.7 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended

December 31, 2010, an increase of 66%. The growth in unique users increased the number of graphical display impressions available for sale and advertiser demand for graphical display inventory.

2008 Compared to 2009.    Overall revenues increased by $6.9 million, or 65%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Marketplace revenues grew to $3.9 million and display revenues grew by 30% in 2009 compared to 2008.

Marketplace revenues grew from $0.1 million in 2008 to $3.9 million, and represented 22% of total revenues in 2009 compared to 1% of total revenues in 2008. The increase in marketplace revenues was due to the full-year impact of selling our Premier Agent program in 2009, as we commenced selling this product in October 2008.

Display revenues grew from $10.5 million in 2008 to $13.6 million, and represented 78% of total revenues in 2009 compared to 99% of total revenues in 2008. The increase in display revenues was primarily the result of the increase in our unique users, which increased from 5.5 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2008 to 7.6 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 38%, as well as the increased productivity of our field sales team.

2009 Compared to 2010.    Cost of revenues increased by $0.9 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was the result of $0.5 million greater ad serving, credit card fees and other costs and an increase of $0.3 million in headcount expenses for employees supporting the operation of our website. We expect that our cost of revenues will increase in future years as we continue to incur more expenses that are associated with growth in revenues.

2008 Compared to 2009.    Cost of revenues decreased by $0.2 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was driven by a decline in headcount expenses of $0.4 million resulting from a headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in ad serving and credit card fees related to revenue growth.

2009 Compared to 2010.    Sales and marketing expenses increased by $5.3 million, or 55%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase is related to growth in headcount expenses and related commissions of $5.1 million, primarily for our sales team to promote sales of our Premier Agent program, and tradeshows, conferences and related travel expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future years as we continue to invest more resources in growing our sales team and potentially invest in advertising. Although these expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues in the near term, we expect these expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues in the long term.

2008 Compared to 2009.    Sales and marketing expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 29%, in 2009 from 2008. The increase was primarily related to growth in headcount expenses and related commissions of $3.2 million, primarily offset by a reduction in marketing and related consulting expenses of $0.9 million. The increase in headcount expenses was primarily attributable to the impact of hiring a local sales team to sell and

promote our Premier Agent program. The offsetting decreases in marketing and related consulting expenses were primarily attributable to spending reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008.

2009 Compared to 2010.    Technology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, decreased by $0.6 million, or 5%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was the result of a reduction of $1.2 million in depreciation and amortization expense as historical purchases of computer equipment reached the end of their depreciable lives and significant components of capitalized website development costs being fully amortized, offset by a $0.6 million increase in headcount expenses and consulting expenses. Amortization expense included for capitalized website development costs was $4.2 million and $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense included for purchased data content intangible assets was $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Other data agreement expense was $0.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. While we expect our technology and development expenses to increase over time as we continue to build new website and mobile functionality, we expect these expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue.

2008 Compared to 2009.    Technology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, decreased by $3.8 million, or 25%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Approximately $1.7 million of the decrease was related to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to historical purchases of computer equipment reaching the end of their depreciable lives and significant components of capitalized website development costs becoming fully amortized. In addition, $1.3 million of the decrease was related to the full year impact of our headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of 2008. Various reductions in other spending categories, totaling $0.8 million, such as software expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses and consulting service expenses also contributed to the overall decrease from the prior year in technology and development expenses. Amortization expense included for capitalized website development costs was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Amortization expense included for purchased data content intangible assets was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Other data agreement expense was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

2009 Compared to 2010.    General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.2 million, or 22%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount expenses of approximately $1.0 million. Legal expenses also increased by $0.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in litigation activity relating to lawsuits filed against us in 2010. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the near term as we invest in headcount expenses and expenses associated with being a public company, but remain flat or decline as a percentage of revenues over the long term.

2008 Compared to 2009.    General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.3 million, or 5%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was largely a result of the headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of 2008 and to other initiatives we implemented at that time to reduce spending. Headcount expenses decreased by approximately $0.2 million, consulting expenses decreased by $0.2 million and legal expenses

decreased by $0.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $0.3 million in other expenses.

2009 Compared to 2010.    Other income decreased by 43% in 2010 compared to 2009, largely as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and lower yields on those assets. We expect other income to increase in the near term because our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are expected to increase as a result of the net proceeds from this offering and the proceeds of the concurrent private placement.

2008 Compared to 2009.    Other income decreased by approximately $0.6 million, or 84%, in 2009 compared to 2008, largely as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and lower yields on those assets.

The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the nine quarters presented below. In the opinion of management, the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements included in this prospectus, and reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of any future period. You should read this data together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The following tables present our revenues by type and as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:

Revenues increased sequentially in all quarters presented with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2009 as display revenues were negatively impacted in that quarter by a decrease in monthly unique users for the quarter. The strong increase in consumer adoption of our website and mobile applications in 2010 was reflected in the significant growth in unique users over the year, which contributed to substantial increases in marketplace revenues. As a result, we experienced less seasonality in revenues, with no decrease in the fourth quarter of 2010, as we grew our marketplace products and services. We have experienced seasonality in our display revenues generally as a result of fluctuations of traffic to our website and mobile devices. However, in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 we experienced sequential declines in display revenues largely due to price decreases associated with changes relating to our display remnant program.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the nine quarters presented below. Please refer to Adjusted EBITDA in the section entitled Selected Financial and Other Data for more information.

The following tables set forth our key growth drivers for each of the nine quarters in the period ended March 31, 2011.

We have funded our operations since inception primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, and in 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2011 from cash generated from operations. Through 2007, we raised approximately $81.0 million through various offerings of our convertible preferred stock and approximately $5.9 million from the sale of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2010 and as of March 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $13.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with our financial institutions and money market funds. Short-term investments as of December 31, 2010 and as of March 31, 2011 consisted of U.S. Treasury securities. Amounts on deposit with third-party financial institutions exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. We believe that cash from operations and cash and short-term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.

During March 2011, we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to establish a line of credit of $4.0 million, secured by substantially all our assets other than our intellectual property, to be

used for general business purposes. The line of credit contains financial and non-financial covenants. As of March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants. The line of credit is available through March 2013. During March 2011, we executed a standby letter of credit of $1.5 million in connection with the lease of our new Seattle offices and reserved this amount against the line of credit, which reduces the available line to $2.5 million. As of March 31, 2011, there were no other amounts outstanding under the line of credit.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities

For the three months ended March 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million. This was driven by a net loss of $0.8 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense of $1.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $2.4 million.

In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 million. This was driven primarily by an increase in the deferred revenue balance of $2.5 million.

In 2009, net cash used in operating activities was $4.2 million. This was driven by a net loss of $12.9 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense of $6.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced cash used in operating activities by $0.8 million.

In 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $13.0 million. This was driven by a net loss of $21.2 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense of $8.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced cash used in operating activities by $1.5 million, primarily impacted by a decrease in the accounts receivable balance by $1.1 million.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities

Our primary investing activities include the purchase and maturity of short-term investments and the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets.

For the three months ended March 31, 2011, we used $5.4 million of net cash in investing activities. This was the result of $3.0 million of net purchases of short-term investments, $1.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets and $1.0 million paid in connection with our March 2011 acquisition of the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million. This was the result of $10.2 million of net proceeds from short-term investments partially offset by $5.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we used $14.5 million of net cash in investing activities. This was the result of $10.4 million of net purchases of short-term investments and $4.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we used $5.8 million of net cash in investing activities. This was the result of $4.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets and $1.0 million of net purchases of short-term investments.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities

Our financing activities have primarily resulted from the exercise of employee non-qualified stock options. The proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock from the exercise of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011.

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2009 or 2010 or as of March 31, 2011.

We have various operating leases for office space and equipment. Our current headquarters in Seattle, Washington is under an operating lease expiring in February 2013 and we have entered into an operating lease for our new headquarters in Seattle, Washington under which we will be obligated to make payments beginning in December 2012 and expiring in November 2022. We also have purchase obligations for content related to our website. We do not have any debt or capital lease obligations. The following table provides a summary of our operating lease obligations and purchase obligations as of March 31, 2011 (unaudited):

The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, website and software development costs, recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our financial statements.

Our revenue is primarily derived from advertising services. In general, we recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.

Our marketplace revenues consist of subscriptions sold to real estate agents under our Premier Agent program, and CPC advertising related to our Zillow Mortgage Marketplace sold to mortgage lenders. Subscription advertising revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the advertising is delivered. Typical terms of our Premier Agent subscription contracts range from six to 12 months. For Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on a mortgage advertisement or on a link to obtain additional information about a mortgage loan quote.

Display revenues primarily consist of graphical advertising sold on a CPM basis to advertisers. We recognize these revenues as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our website or mobile applications.

We review accounts receivable on a regular basis and estimate an amount of losses for uncollectible accounts based on our historical collections experience, age of the receivable, knowledge of the customer and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.

The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website (or software) that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.

Capitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at one year. Estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality.

Recoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such review at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.

We measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair-value for awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting periods. Management has determined the Black-Scholes-Merton fair value of our stock option awards and related share-based compensation expense with the assistance of third-party valuations. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated Class A common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model changes significantly, share-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. In valuing our options, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives, including estimated forfeiture rates, of the options.

Risk-free rate.    Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option grant date.

Expected dividend yields.    Expected dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date.

Volatility.    Absent a public market for our shares, we have historically estimated volatility of our share price based on the published historical volatilities of industry peers in the online publishing market (primarily the financial and real estate services industries) representing the verticals in which we operate.

Expected term.    We estimate the weighted-average expected life of the options as the average of the vesting option schedule and the term of the award, since, due to the limited period of time share-based awards have been exercisable, we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The term of the award is estimated using the simplified method as the awards granted are plain vanilla share options.

Forfeiture rate.    Forfeiture rates are estimated using historical actual forfeiture trends as well as our judgment of future forfeitures. These rates are evaluated at least annually and any change in compensation expense is recognized in the period of the change. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the types of awards and employee class. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from managements current estimates.

The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:

Valuation of Class A Common Stock.    The following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares of our Class A common stock subject to stock options granted since January 1, 2010, the associated per share exercise price, the fair value per share at the date of grant and the intrinsic value per share at the date of grant.

Since July 2006, we have obtained valuation analyses prepared by a third-party valuation firm to assist us in determining the fair value of our Class A common stock. The valuations used methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the AICPA Practice Guide. In obtaining third-party valuations of our Class A common stock, our management provided the third-party valuation firm with projections for revenue and expenses on a cash basis, and information about our prospects, our performance and economic and financial market conditions, which the valuation firm used, along with other information, to perform its valuation analysis. These valuations were reviewed by management and either the board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors in conjunction with share-based compensation grants. In determining the fair value of our Class A common stock, the board of directors and the compensation committee of our board of directors considered these valuation reports, and other qualitative and quantitative factors that they considered relevant, including:

The third-party valuation firm performed a top-down valuation by applying the Income Approach (as discussed below) to calculate a business enterprise value from which the estimated fair value of our Class A common stock was derived. We prepared financial forecasts for revenue and expenses on a cash basis for five

calendar years, which the third-party valuation firm used in its discounted cash flow, or DCF, methodology to estimate our enterprise value using the Income Approach. The financial forecasts were based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue growth rates and expenses, that took into account our past experience and future expectations. The valuation reports were based upon information contemporaneous with the as of date of the valuations, and did not give effect to facts or events occurring between that date and the date the reports were issued.

Under the Income Approach using the DCF methodology, estimated future free cash flow returns are discounted to present value at an appropriate rate of return for the investment, where the discount reflects the degree of risk associated with the future returns and returns available from alternative investments. Higher risk leads to a higher discount rate, which produces a lower value for the investment. Under the Income Approach, discrete period cash flows were determined over several years, and estimated in a residual period. The analysis was based on a number of assumptions, including:

The valuation looked at publicly held companies whose stocks are actively traded (the comparable public company methodology) to derive appropriate ratios and multiples for determining the free cash flows and residual value used in the DCF methodology. To develop an appropriate discount rate to apply to our cash flows, the valuation looked at required venture capital rates for investments in companies at various stages of the business cycle.

After using the DCF methodology to arrive at a business enterprise value, the valuation looked at similar companies involved in merger or acquisition transactions and used the comparable public company methodology to benchmark our enterprise value as a multiple of projected revenues and EBITDA. The valuation then added our cash balance to the enterprise value to arrive at the fair value of invested capital, or the value available to all investors of a company, including equity capital (common and preferred), before consideration of any non-operating assets or liabilities. After arriving at the fair value for our total invested capital, the total value of equity is allocated over several series of convertible preferred stock, several classes of common stock and stock options to purchase Class A common stock. Consistent with the AICPA Practice Guide, the value of each share of convertible preferred stock and each share of common stock can be inferred by analyzing various option-pricing methodologies.

The option method models the fair value of the various securities comprising a companys capital structure as a series of call options on the proceeds expected from the sale of the company or the liquidation of its assets at some future date. The model estimates the fair value of each class of securities as a function of the current estimated fair value of the company and assumptions based on the rights and preferences of the respective class. Under the option-pricing methodology used by the third-party valuation firm, the enterprise value was allocated to the convertible preferred stock, several classes of common stock and stock options to purchase Class A common stock using a version of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation methodology. To determine the Black-Scholes-Merton assumptions, the time to a liquidity event is estimated, the risk-free rate is determined (typically based on the rate available on a government security whose term matches the assumed time to liquidity) and the volatility assumption is determined. For a private company, volatility is based on the historical stock performance for comparable public companies and consideration of the relative lifecycle stage of the company.

The stock options granted on these dates have an exercise price of $3.59 per share. Our board of directors (with respect to the March 17 grants) and the compensation committee of our board of directors (with respect to

the March 12 grants) determined this price taking into account the third-party valuation of our Class A common stock performed as of March 1, 2010, which estimated that the fair value of our Class A common stock at that time was $3.59 per share. In the March 2010 valuation, under the Income Approach, a discount rate of 25% was applied. After arriving at a business enterprise value, our cash balance was added to arrive at the fair value of total invested capital. A portion of the fair value for our total invested capital was then allocated to our Class A common stock under the option-valuation methodology, assuming the following inputs: risk free rate of approximately 0.8%; volatility of approximately 65%; and time to expiration of approximately two years. Finally, the valuation applied a marketability discount of 30% to account for the lack of liquidity relative to a public market.

For purposes of the April 15 and May 20 stock option grants, the compensation committee determined that there had been no significant change in our business or industry that would warrant a different valuation than the fair value of our Class A common stock determined in March 2010, and continued to grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair value as reflected in the March 1, 2010 valuation.

The stock options granted on these dates have an exercise price of $3.25 per share. The compensation committee of our board of directors determined this price taking into account the third-party valuation of our Class A common stock performed as of June 30, 2010, which estimated that the fair value of our Class A common stock at that time was $3.25 per share. The decrease in the fair value of our Class A common stock from March 1, 2010, was primarily due to the fact that, in 2010, despite growth in revenues, for the period April 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 11% and significant macroeconomic pressures on the financial sector and housing markets, including the European debt crisis, continued to put at risk the predictability of future cash flows of the business. As a result, the business enterprise value of our company at June 30, 2010 was determined to be lower than the enterprise value of Zillow at March 1, 2010. In the June 2010 valuation, under the Income Approach, a discount rate of 25% was applied. After arriving at a business enterprise value, our cash balance was added to arrive at the fair value of total invested capital. A portion of the fair value for our total invested capital was then allocated to our Class A common stock under the option-valuation methodology, assuming the following inputs: risk free rate of approximately 0.54%; volatility of approximately 65%; and time to expiration of approximately 1.75 years. Finally, the valuation applied a marketability discount of 25%, to account for the lack of liquidity relative to a public market.

For purposes of the stock option grants in August through December 2010, the compensation committee of our board of directors determined that there had been no significant change in our business or prospects that would warrant a different valuation than the fair value of our Class A common stock determined in June 2010, and continued to grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair value as reflected in the June 30, 2010 valuation. While our revenues increased over that period, we continued to operate at a net loss, as we faced a challenging housing market and a slowly recovering economy.

The stock options granted on this date have an exercise price of $3.89 per share. The compensation committee of our board of directors determined this price taking into account the third-party valuation of our Class A common stock performed as of December 31, 2010, which estimated that the fair value of our Class A common stock at that time was $3.89 per share. The increase over the June 2010 valuation was in part due to the positive impact on our projections of various initiatives that we had undertaken in 2010 to drive more traffic to our site and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities, offset in part by continued distress in the housing market, constrained mortgage lending markets and historically high rates of foreclosures. In the third-party valuation firms December 31, 2010 valuation, two alternative scenarios were considered: (a) our continued operation as a private company with a potential merger or acquisition of Zillow during the 2.5 years following the valuation date (the delayed event scenario); and (b) a potential initial public offering, or IPO, during 2011

(the IPO scenario). In the December 2010 valuation, under the Income Approach, a discount rate of 25% was applied. After arriving at a business enterprise value, our cash balance was added to arrive at the fair value of invested capital. The fair value of invested capital was then allocated to our common stock under each liquidation scenario. Under the IPO scenario, the fair value per share of Class A common stock was estimated by dividing the total equity value by the number of common equivalent shares outstanding. Under the delayed event scenario, the fair value per share of Class A common stock was determined using the version of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-valuation methodology used in previous valuations, and the following inputs were assumed: risk free rate of approximately 0.82%; volatility of approximately 55%; and time to expiration of approximately 2.5 years. The valuation applied a marketability discount of 15% to the fair value determined under the IPO scenario and a marketability discount of 30% to the fair value determined under the delayed event scenario, to account for the lack of liquidity relative to a public market. The weighting of the common equity value per share assumed a delayed event at 75% and the common equity value per share based on an IPO at 25%, in reaching the fair value of $3.89 per share.

Due to the proximity of the stock option grants on March 1, 2011 to the anticipated date of consummation of our initial public offering, we reassessed the Class A common stock fair value as of March 1, 2011, resulting in a fair value per share of $4.40. The reassessed fair value was determined using the same valuation methodology used in the recent third-party valuations, including the valuation as of December 31, 2010. However, we revised the weighting of the IPO scenario to 50% and reduced the weighting of the delayed event scenario to 50%. This revision added $0.51 to the per share fair value of our Class A common stock as originally determined on March 1, 2011.

The stock options granted on this date have an exercise price of $6.33 per share. The compensation committee of our board of directors determined this price taking into account the third-party valuation of our Class A common stock performed as of May 20, 2011, which estimated that the fair value of our Class A common stock at that time was $6.33 per share. The increase over the December 31, 2010 valuation was primarily due to the positive impact on the May 20, 2011 valuation of a revised five-year forecast we prepared in May that included increases in our projected revenues and EBITDA, and an increase in the weighting of the common equity value per share based on an initial public offering, or IPO. In the third-party valuation firms May 20, 2011 valuation, two alternative scenarios were considered: (a) our continued operation as a private company with a potential merger or acquisition of Zillow during the two years following the valuation date (the delayed event scenario); and (b) a potential IPO during 2011 (the IPO scenario). In the May 2011 valuation, under the Income Approach, a discount rate of 25% was applied. After arriving at a business enterprise value, our cash balance was added to arrive at the fair value of invested capital. The fair value of invested capital was then allocated to our common stock under each liquidation scenario. Under the IPO scenario, the fair value per share of Class A common stock was estimated by dividing the total equity value by the number of common equivalent shares outstanding. Under the delayed event scenario, the fair value per share of Class A common stock was determined using the version of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-valuation methodology used in previous valuations, and the following inputs were assumed: risk free rate of approximately 0.58%; volatility of approximately 55%; and time to expiration of approximately two years. The valuation applied a marketability discount of 10% to the fair value determined under the IPO scenario and a marketability discount of 30% to the fair value determined under the delayed event scenario, to account for the lack of liquidity relative to a public market. The weighting of the common equity value per share assumed a delayed event at 50% and the common equity value per share based on an IPO at 50%, in reaching the fair value of $6.33 per share.

Due to the proximity of the stock option grants on May 23, 2011 to the anticipated date of consummation of our initial public offering, we reassessed the Class A common stock fair value as of May 23, 2011, resulting in a fair value per share of $6.97. The reassessed fair value was determined using the same valuation methodology used in recent third-party valuations, including the valuation as of May 20, 2011. However, we revised the weighting of the IPO scenario to 75% and reduced the weighting of the delayed event scenario to 25%. This

revision added $0.64 to the per share fair value of our Class A common stock as originally determined on May 23, 2011.

The reassessed fair value of our Class A common stock as of May 23, 2011 is lower than the midpoint of the range of the expected initial public offering price shown on the cover of this prospectus, largely because the private company valuation used for purposes of pricing stock options is based on different factors than those typically used to determine an estimated offering price range in an initial public offering. The determination of fair value as of May 23, 2011 for stock option pricing purposes took into account a third-party valuation that used a DCF methodology, which includes a terminal value based on our estimated EBTIDA performance after a five-year discrete projection period. In making this calculation, a set of actively traded public companies was used to derive an appropriate multiple to apply to our projected EBITDA. The terminal value is intended to approximate the value of our company at the end of the five-year period. Therefore, our third-party valuation firm determined that it was appropriate to use more mature public companies as comparables because they generally have more stabilized EBITDA growth rates than earlier stage public companies and as a result have multiples that more accurately reflect expected performance over the long term. Accordingly, over the last five years, we have used a largely consistent set of more mature comparable publicly held companies in our valuations.

The DCF methodology also took into account the absence of a liquid trading market for our Class A common stock and the uncertainty of our ability to access the public markets through an IPO. These factors also contribute to the difference between the May 23, 2011 valuation and the midpoint of the range of the expected initial public offering price shown on the cover of this prospectus. Specifically, the valuation applied a marketability discount of 10% to the fair value determination under the IPO scenario and a marketability discount of 30% to the fair value determination under the delayed event scenario. In addition, because the successful conclusion of an IPO was uncertain as of May 23, 2011, the higher value IPO scenario was weighted at a 75% probability.

In contrast, the range of the expected initial public offering price shown on the cover of this prospectus does not factor in any discounts for illiquidity and assumes the successful completion of our IPO. The expected initial public offering price range is based in part upon multiples of projected revenues and EBITDA derived from stock prices for public companies that may have higher growth rates than the companies used to establish terminal value under the DCF methodology. The companies that were considered during discussions regarding the establishment of the expected initial public offering price range include companies that recently completed initial public offerings, including two companies that had not completed their initial public offerings at the time of our May 23, 2011 valuation. These earlier stage public companies, which generally have higher EBITDA growth rates and therefore higher multiples than more mature public companies, are not appropriate for our valuations for the purposes of establishing the fair value of our Class A common stock for stock options based on the DCF methodology that relies on a calculation of terminal value after a five-year period based on expected performance over that period.

The difference between our May 23, 2011 valuation and the midpoint of the range of the expected initial public offering price shown on the cover of this prospectus is also the result of the increased likelihood of consummating our IPO since May 23, 2011 as a result of our progress with respect to the offering, including the filing of amendments to our registration statement, the successful completion of initial public offerings of other companies and the aftermarket performance of these companies since May 23, 2011, and the marketing of this offering since July 6, 2011.

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2009-13 regarding ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition  Multiple-element Arrangements. This ASU addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multiple-element arrangements. ASU 2009-13 requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or other third-party evidence, or TPE, of the selling price. The changes

under ASU 2009-13 are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified subsequent to adoption. We adopted the changes under ASU 2009-13 effective January 1, 2011. Management does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have any impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures based on the types of revenue arrangements we have historically entered into and currently have in place.

Effective October 31, 2009, we adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This standard establishes only two levels of GAAP, authoritative and non-authoritative. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, became the source of authoritative, non-governmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. As the Codification was not intended to change or alter existing GAAP, it did not have any impact on our financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements, amends disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. Accordingly, we adopted this new guidance beginning January 1, 2010, except for the additional Level 3 requirements, which we adopted effective January 1, 2011. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those whose fair value inputs are unobservable and reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of fluctuations in interest rates.

We do not have any long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2010 or as of March 31, 2011.

Under our current investment policy, we invest our excess cash in money market funds, FDIC-insured certificates of deposits and U.S. Treasury securities. Our current investment policy seeks first to preserve principal, second to provide liquidity for our operating and capital needs and third to maximize yield without putting our principal at risk.

Our investments are exposed to market risk due to the fluctuation of prevailing interest rates that may reduce the yield on our investments or their fair value. As our investment portfolio is short-term in nature, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and therefore we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates.

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our mission is to build the most trusted and vibrant home-related marketplace

to empower consumers with information and tools to make intelligent decisions about homes.

Zillow is the leading real estate information marketplace. We provide vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through our website and mobile applications, enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs. We are transforming the way people make home-related decisions. Zillow provides consumers and real estate professionals an edge in real estate.

We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible. Our living database of more than 100 million U.S. homes  including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market  attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else. These profiles include rich, detailed information about homes such as property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, both through our website and through our industry-leading mobile applications that allow consumers to access our information when they are curbside, viewing homes.

Homes are the center of peoples lives, the focus of some of their most important decisions and often their most valuable assets. In addition to whether to buy, sell or rent, consumers make many other important home-related decisions throughout their lifetimes, including decisions relating to refinancing or home equity loans, home maintenance and home improvement. Residential real estate is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and supports a large number of professionals that provide home-related services.

Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes. We present residential real estate data in novel ways that have revolutionized the way consumers search for, find and understand home-related information and make real estate decisions. Consumers increasingly are turning to the Internet and mobile devices for real estate information. During May 2011, 22.0 million unique users visited our website and mobile applications, representing year-over-year growth of 102%.

Real estate and mortgage professionals are a critical part of the home-related marketplace. We enable consumers to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs. We have created a trusted and transparent marketplace where consumers can search and read reviews on local real estate and mortgage professionals and contact those professionals on their own terms. Consumers initiate contact through our marketplace when they are ready to speak with real estate and mortgage professionals  providing those professionals with access to highly qualified clients and providing consumers with control over their decision-making process.

We generate revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our revenues have grown significantly since our launch in 2006. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, we generated revenues of $5.3 million and $11.3 million, respectively, an increase of 111%. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated revenues of $30.5 million, as compared to $17.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an increase of 74%.

Homes are the center of peoples lives, the focus of some of their most important decisions and often their most valuable assets. Deciding where to live, which home to choose and whether and when to rent or buy are among the most important decisions a person must make. Historically, objective information and advice about the value of homes has been hard to find and keep current, even though a homes changing value can profoundly influence many financial and personal decisions. In addition to whether to buy, sell or rent, consumers make many other important home-related decisions throughout their lifetimes, including decisions relating to refinancing or home equity loans, home maintenance and home improvement.

Residential real estate is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and supports a large number of professionals that provide the following home-related services:

Purchase and Sale.    Sales of existing and new homes in the United States in 2010 had an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1.2 trillion, according to data published in April 2011 by the U.S. Census Bureau and NAR. Residential real estate brokerage commissions and fees were approximately $60 billion in 2010, as derived by Zillow using data released in 2011 by the U.S. Census Bureau, NAR and REAL Trends. There are more than 1.8 million licensed real estate agents in the United States, according to data published in April 2011 by the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials. In an effort to acquire new client relationships and sell homes, real estate agents and brokers spent an estimated $6.2 billion on residential advertising in 2010, according to a 2011 report published by Borrell Associates.

Rental.    The overall size of the U.S. rental housing market, including rent, utilities and insurance, exceeded $300 billion in 2009, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in March 2011 and our own estimates.

Home Financing.    In 2009 in the United States, 4.6 million purchase loans were originated, representing more than $852 billion in borrowings, and 8.1 million refinancing and home equity loans were originated, representing more than $1.7 trillion in borrowings, according to data available from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These loans generated approximately $26 billion in fees for mortgage lenders and brokers, according to data available from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, data released in December 2010 by the Mortgage Bankers Association and our own analysis. There were approximately 266,000 mortgage lenders and brokers in the U.S. in 2009, according to data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Home Maintenance and Improvement.    Approximately $463 billion was spent on home improvement and repair by U.S. consumers in 2010, according to an April 2011 report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Additionally, more than 650,000 businesses in 2007 earned the majority of their revenue by providing remodeling services, according to a January 2011 report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

The market for residential real estate transactions and home-related services is highly fragmented, local and complex. Each home has unique characteristics, including location, value, size, style, age and condition. Each consumer approaches home-related transactions with a personal set of objectives, priorities and values. Real estate agents generally operate in local markets as independent contractors with different experience and skills. These conditions create challenges for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals alike. Consumers are challenged to find information about homes, and to find real estate and mortgage professionals who fit their individual needs. Real estate and mortgage professionals are challenged to efficiently advertise their services and identify new clients, and to measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.

Historically, consumers had minimal access to comprehensive and objective residential real estate data, even though many home-related decisions are extraordinarily information-intensive. While real estate and mortgage professionals had some data, consumers did not have free, independent and easy access to it. Even when accessible, the data was difficult to interpret and analyze.

Increasing Role of the Internet and Mobile Technologies

Consumers are increasingly turning to the Internet and mobile devices for real estate information. In 2010, 89% of buyers used the Internet to search for homes and 38% of buyers found through the Internet the actual home they purchased, according to the 2010 National Association of REALTORS Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers. With the widespread adoption of mobile and location-based technologies, consumers increasingly expect home-related information to be available on their mobile devices where, when and how they want it.

Historically, finding answers to these and other important questions was challenging for many reasons:

The fragmented nature of the residential real estate market has made it difficult for real estate and mortgage professionals, including real estate brokers and agents and mortgage lenders, to market their services effectively. Real estate and mortgage professionals operating in this environment are challenged to build their reputations in crowded local markets, reach potential clients at the right time, distinguish themselves from other real estate and mortgage professionals and cost-effectively promote their qualifications, real estate listings or mortgage loan rates.

We are transforming the way consumers make home-related decisions and connect with real estate and mortgage professionals. We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible and to providing transparency for all market participants. Our living database of homes, Zestimates and Rent Zestimates form the foundation of our products and services.

Our dynamic and comprehensive living database includes detailed information on more than 100 million U.S. homes, or most U.S. homes, and includes homes for sale, for rent and recently sold, as well as properties not currently on the market. This database is central to the value we provide to consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals. It contains extensive information that users can search, through an easy-to-use interface, to identify, analyze and compare homes. Our database is relevant to a broad range of users, including buyers, sellers, renters, homeowners, real estate agents and other real estate professionals. It includes information such as:

We synthesize data from hundreds of automated feeds, representing information from tens of thousands of public and private sources. Applying extensive computer analytics to the data, we transform it into information that is accessible, understandable and useful.

We refer to the database as living because the information is continually updated by the combination of our proprietary algorithms, synthesis of third-party data from hundreds of sources, and through improvements by us and, importantly, by our community of users. User-generated content from owners, agents and others enriches our database with photos and additional property information. For example, individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes in our database and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else.

We have developed industry-leading automated home valuation models that use advanced statistical methods and complex, proprietary algorithms. We use these models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes. In addition, based on our Zestimates, we produce Zillow Home Value Indexes at the neighborhood, zip code, city, metropolitan statistical area, county and national levels. Our Zillow Home Value Indexes have been cited by government entities such as the Federal Reserve Bank and the Congressional Oversight Panel, university studies and respected national publications. For historical comparisons, we provide up to 15 years of Zestimate history on each home and valuable information about property and real estate market trends. Our Zestimates, Rent Zestimates and Zillow Home Value Indexes allow consumers to evaluate homes and neighborhoods, and to easily evaluate historical trends, as they contemplate critical home-related decisions.

Our living database, Zestimates and Rent Zestimates have enabled us to create innovative products and services that empower consumers, including:

We believe we have the following competitive advantages:

We provide advertising products and services for real estate and mortgage professionals that provide useful content for consumers.

Real estate agents in the Premier Agent program can purchase targeted advertising on Zillow by zip code, at prices that vary based on a number of factors. As part of the Premier Agent subscription, the agents ratings, photo and contact information are featured alongside home profiles and listings in the relevant zip code, giving the agent exposure to qualified home shoppers interested in homes in their subscribed zip code. Premier Agents also receive other benefits, including featured listings, showcase advertisements and designation as a Premier Agent in Zillows directory. Premier Agent subscribers have access to a portal on our website where we provide individualized program analytics, including detailed information on each contact and on clicks and impressions with respect to featured listings and showcase advertisements.

In Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, consumers request free, personalized quotes in response to their submission of limited anonymous data, such as specific loan amount, zip code, purchase price or estimated home

value, and credit score. In the first five months of 2011, consumers submitted more than 1.7 million mortgage loan requests in Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. Consumers decide if and when to contact the mortgage professionals who provide quotes. User-generated ratings and reviews of mortgage professionals are provided as a powerful tool to help consumers shop for their loans.

Our display advertising primarily consists of graphical web and mobile advertising sold on a CPM basis. We offer these businesses display advertising opportunities on our home page, on individual web pages through graphical displays and text links, and on our mobile applications through display ads that are optimized for the mobile experience.

We provide consumers with information products and services to enable them to make intelligent decisions about homes.

Our Zestimate and Rent Zestimate valuations are computed using complex, proprietary algorithms we have developed and refined through years of statistical analysis and technological development.

A Zestimate is our estimated current market value of a home. We generate Zestimates using proprietary information, including:

We use proprietary automated valuation models that apply advanced algorithms to analyze our data to identify relationships, within a specific geographic area, between this home-related data and actual sales prices. Home characteristics, such as square footage, location or the number of bathrooms, are given different weights according to their influence on home sale prices in each specific geography over a specific period of time, resulting in a set of valuation rules, or models, that are applied to generate each homes Zestimate.

To improve the accuracy of our Zestimates, our algorithms automatically remove or reconcile data that would otherwise inappropriately skew the valuation rules. In addition, our algorithms will automatically generate a new set of valuation rules based on the constantly changing universe of data included in our database. This allows us to provide timely home value information on a massive scale. Three times a week, we create more than 1.2 million unique valuation models, built atop 3.2 terabytes of data, to generate current Zestimates on nearly 100 million U.S. homes.

We publicly disclose the accuracy of our Zestimates to further empower consumers in assessing a homes value. The accuracy may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the amount of data about homes we have for a particular geographic area.

A Rent Zestimate is our estimated current monthly rental price of a home, computed using similar automated valuation models we have designed to address the unique attributes of a rental home. We estimate rental prices on nearly 100 million homes, including apartments, single-family homes, condominiums and townhomes.

We provide consumers and real estate professionals with a rich set of home-related information. Through our website or mobile applications, users can access detailed information about homes, including:

Consumers and real estate professionals can update property information, including, for example, by adding home photos and personalized information regarding the neighborhood or school district, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else.

Our map-based user interface enables our users to search, navigate and zoom to areas of interest and find and compare home information quickly and efficiently from a variety of different perspectives across homes, neighborhoods, cities, counties and other geographical regions. Our consumer search experience supports complex search queries and filters across our data set of homes, allowing consumers to customize their searches and gain actionable insights.

Our team of economists and statisticians generates unbiased local and national real estate data and analysis on 371 metropolitan areas and approximately 7,000 individual neighborhoods that we provide to consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals at no cost. This gives our users access to local market trends and data, such as home price cuts, list to sale price ratio and foreclosure data that was historically not easily obtained, if available at all. Users can compare these metrics across neighborhoods and different time periods using our real-time charting and filtering.

We provide comprehensive for sale and rental listings through relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listings aggregators, multiple listing services, apartment management companies, home builders and other third-parties. In addition, we provide consumers with access to exclusive home listings, such as our Make Me Move listings, which are a homeowners posted price at which they would be willing to move. We also show listings that may not be available on other sources, such as for sale by owner, foreclosure and rental listings. Real estate agents and landlords may feature and gain more exposure for their listings through our advertising products.

We present consumers with ratings and contact information for the listing agent and local buyers agents alongside home profiles and listings for homes to assist them in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. We enhance this offering by providing an online professional directory for consumers to search and contact real estate professionals that they might wish to engage. Our directory includes rich profiles of real estate professionals, including more than 50,000 ratings and reviews provided by our users as of June 9, 2011, allowing consumers to evaluate these agents based on a number of criteria, including neighborhood specialization, number of listings and number of contributions to Zillow Advice.

Consumers have many questions and often seek advice during various stages of their home-ownership lifecycle. The Zillow Advice section of our website captures questions and discussion topics from our users, both consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals. This allows our consumers to ask questions of other consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals and quickly learn more about relevant topics. Our users have submitted more than 420,000 questions and answers to Zillow Advice as of June 9, 2011. Zillow Advice also provides real estate and mortgage professionals with an opportunity to help educate consumers and demonstrate their local expertise. These discussions and content are also indexed and searchable by geography and other custom parameters, allowing users to quickly find the information they seek. Email updates are used to provide ongoing monitoring and delivery of posts related to topics of interest.

We operate the most popular platform of mobile real estate applications across iPhone, iPad, Android and BlackBerry. Our mobile real estate applications provide consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals with mobile, on location access to many of our products and services, including Zestimates, Rent Zestimates, for sale and rental listings and extensive home-related data. Through our mobile applications, for example, a consumer standing curbside at a home for sale can learn about the homes price, Zestimate, number of bedrooms, and square footage and past sales, as well as similar information about surrounding homes. The consumer can call a real estate professional through our mobile applications to get more information or schedule a showing. During May 2011, Zillow was used on a mobile device more than 8.8 million times, with more than 1.7 million homes viewed on mobile devices each day.

At Zillow, marketing starts with product development. We create compelling consumer products that people want to talk about and share. This enables us to execute a robust and viral communications program that is the primary driver of our brand and traffic acquisition efforts. We launched the Zillow brand with communications at the core of our marketing strategy, which has allowed us to grow to 22.0 million unique users during May 2011 with virtually no advertising expense to date.

Our communications team includes former print and broadcast journalists, who have established Zillow as an authoritative source for information on a broad range of home and real estate-related subjects. A typical week includes commentary from our real estate experts across dozens of national print and broadcast media outlets, guest opinion pieces or blog posts by our chief economist, and wide-ranging national and local media coverage of Zillow products, listings, data, and consumer tips. We also produce considerable home and real estate-related content on Zillow Blog that is syndicated across numerous prominent media sites. Zillow Blog content ranges from real estate market trends, to home financing tips, to celebrity real estate listings.

We focus substantial public relations effort around the marketing of our Zillow Real Estate Market Reports, which are in-depth reports produced by our economics and analytics bureau for 134 U.S. markets. Data is released on a monthly and quarterly basis, and Zillow data is widely used by government entities such as the Federal Reserve and Congressional Oversight Panel, as well as regularly featured in respected media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters and across numerous national network and cable news shows including CNBC, CNN, Fox News, Bloomberg and MSNBC. We believe the considerable effort we have spent on public relations and social media has allowed us to build a large and credible brand.

Our living database of homes creates significant opportunities for home-ownership lifecycle marketing. A typical person will at various times in life be a renter, buyer, homeowner, mortgage refinancer or seller, and this presents opportunities to communicate with consumers over many years, not just during a transaction. We actively segment and communicate with our users through email and social media channels. In 2010, we sent more than 125 million email messages to Zillow email subscribers, and we see substantial opportunities to grow home-ownership lifecycle marketing.

We believe Zillow has considerable opportunity to increase brand awareness and grow traffic through product development, targeted marketing programs and strategic partnerships.

Our sales team is responsible for generating advertising customers across our website and mobile applications.

We use a Seattle-based inside sales team to sell Premier Agent subscriptions to real estate agents and Zillow Mortgage Marketplace advertising to mortgage lenders. We attract these customers through a combination of outbound calling and inbound customer requests generated from our website and event marketing activities.

We also maintain a field sales team based in New York, with additional offices in Chicago and San Francisco, to specifically target larger advertising customers in the real estate and related content categories, such as real estate brokerages, home builders, lenders and home service providers, as well as advertisers in the telecommunications, automotive, insurance and other industries. Our field sales team develops direct relationships with these advertisers and the agencies that serve them.

As part of our sales and distribution strategy, we entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Inc. that launched in the first quarter of 2011. Our sales team serves as the exclusive sales force for real estate agent advertising and certain graphical advertising on the Yahoo! Real Estate site.

We believe that customer support is important to our success. Our customer support team, which is located in Seattle, responds to commercial, technical and consumer issues from our user community and advertisers. The Zillow Advice forum augments our direct customer support by enabling consumers to obtain answers to questions from our employees and other members of our user community, including real estate and mortgage professionals.

Zillow is a data- and technology-driven company. Our technical infrastructure, website and mobile products are built to provide consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals with access to rich real estate data and powerful online tools to help them accomplish their home-related goals. Many of our services are available through real-time web-based application programming interfaces that allow our information to be easily integrated into third-party websites. We provide HTML and Javascript-based widgets to allow easy integration of Zillow information onto other websites, with little custom programming. Our technology platform is built using industry-leading third party software and internally developed software as well as open source technologies. This combination allows for rapid development and release of high-performance software in a cost-effective and scalable manner. For information about our research and development costs, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our financial statements included with this prospectus.

Our website is hosted at a third-party facility located in the Seattle area. Content delivery network solutions have been put in place to ensure fast and local access to content. Development and test environments are located in a data center we manage at our corporate headquarters. Network, website, service and hardware-level monitoring, coupled with remote-content monitoring allow our systems to maintain a high level of uptime and availability with high-performance delivery.

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.

Our trademarks registered in the United States and several other jurisdictions include: Zillow, Zillow.com, Zestimate and the Zillow logo. We also have filed other trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective.

We have one patent issued in the United States that expires in 2026, and one patent issued in Australia that expires in 2027. These cover proprietary techniques that relate to the incorporation of individual aerial images and incorporating visual information into a master planar image, and the collection, storage and display of home attribute values. We have 11 patent applications pending in the United States, which seek to cover proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective.

We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include Zillow, our other trademarks, and similar variations.

In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our website.

We face competition to attract consumers to our website and mobile applications and to attract advertisers to purchase our advertising products and services.

We compete for the attention of consumers with companies that operate, or could develop, national and local real estate and mortgage websites. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience, the utility of the data and services we provide, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information, and brand awareness and reputation, and competition for consumer attention is intense. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.

We compete for advertising customers with media sites, including websites dedicated to providing real estate and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals and consumers, and major Internet portals, general search engines and social media sites, as well as other online companies. We also compete for a share of advertisers overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as television, magazines, newspapers and home/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate agents and mortgage lenders to advertise their qualifications or listings. We compete for advertising revenues based on perceived return on investment, the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure and our ability to effectively deliver types of ads to targeted demographics. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.

As of May 31, 2011, we had 275 full-time employees. We believe that our team and company culture has been among the keys to our success. As a team, we embrace the following principles:

We are affected by laws and regulations that apply to businesses in general, as well as to businesses operating on the Internet. This includes a continually expanding and evolving range of laws, regulations and standards that address information security, data protection, privacy, consent and advertising, among other things. By providing a medium through which users can post content and communicate with one another, we may also be subject to laws governing intellectual property ownership, obscenity, libel, and privacy, among other issues. In addition, the real estate agents, mortgage brokers, banks, and some of our other customers and advertisers on our website and mobile applications are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations relating to real estate and mortgages. While we do not believe that we are currently subject to these regulations, we intend to ensure that any content created by Zillow is consistent with them by obtaining assurances of compliance from our advertisers and customers for their activities through, and the content they provide on, our website and mobile applications. Since the laws and regulations governing real estate and mortgages are constantly evolving, it is possible that some part of our business activities could fall within the scope of regulation or be prohibited altogether at some point in the future.

In March 2010, Smarter Agent, LLC, a provider of mobile real estate applications, filed a complaint against us and multiple other defendants for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our mobile technology infringes three patents held by Smarter Agent purporting to cover: a Global positioning-based real estate database access device and method, a Position-based information access device and method and a Position-based information access device and method of searching, and seeks an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. We have denied the allegations and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that we are not infringing the patents and that the patents are invalid. In November 2010, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted our petition for re-examination of the three patents-in-suit and its first office action found all claims invalid. In March 2011, the court stayed the litigation pending the completion of the re-examination proceedings.

In April 2010, First American CoreLogic, a provider of information and analytic services, filed a complaint against us and multiple other defendants for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our website technology infringes a patent purporting to cover a Real estate appraisal using predictive modeling, and seeks an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. We have denied the allegations and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that we are not infringing the patent, and that the patent is unenforceable and invalid.

In September 2010, LendingTree, LLC, a provider of an online lending marketplace, filed a complaint against us, and other defendants, for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our website technology infringes two patents purporting to cover a Method and computer network for coordinating a loan over the internet, and seeks an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. We have denied the allegations and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that we are not infringing the patents and that the patents are unenforceable and invalid.

Although the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe we have substantial and meritorious defenses to these claims and that the final outcome of these litigation matters will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business and although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation or claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

In March 2011, we entered into a lease effective through November 2022 for approximately 66,000 square feet of office space that will house our principal offices beginning approximately in August 2011. This new office space will replace our current 46,000 square feet of office space for our principal offices in Seattle under a lease that expires in February 2013. We lease additional office space in San Francisco, Chicago and New York.

Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Blachford, Gurley, Hoag, Maffei and Stephenson do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of The Nasdaq Global Market. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director.

The board of directors also considered the following transactions, relationships and arrangements that are not required to be disclosed in this prospectus as related person transactions. With respect to the independence of

Mr. Gurley, the board considered that Mr. Barton, one of our founders and our Executive Chairman, provides advisory services in a non-employee capacity to Benchmark Capital, a venture capital firm where Mr. Gurley serves as a General Partner. These services include the identification and evaluation for Benchmark of potential investments and related advice. Mr. Barton has also invested in certain of Benchmarks venture capital funds, which capital commitments represent less than 0.5% of the total committed capital of each of the funds. In exchange for Mr. Bartons services, Benchmark pays a portion of Mr. Bartons capital commitments to the funds. With respect to the independence of Mr. Hoag, the board considered that Mr. Barton has invested in TCV V, L.P., a private equity and venture capital fund, and other related funds of Technology Crossover Ventures, or TCV Funds. Mr. Hoag is a member of the general partner of the TCV Funds. Mr. Bartons capital commitment in these funds represents less than 0.2% of the total committed capital of the funds. With respect to the independence of Mr. Blachford, the board considered that (a) Messrs. Blachford and Barton are 50% co-owners of a condominium, (b) Mr. Blachford serves on the boards of directors of two privately-held companies in which Mr. Barton is an investor and, for one of the companies, also serves as a board member, and (c) Mr. Blachford serves as a venture partner of TCMI, Inc., a management entity associated with the TCV Funds.

In connection with this offering, all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock will be converted into shares of our Class A common stock and all existing contractual rights to appoint directors will be terminated. In accordance with our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering, our board of directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms as follows:

At each annual meeting of our shareholders, the successors to directors whose terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number of directors. The authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of our board of directors. Vacancies on our board of directors can be filled by our board of directors.

Our board of directors has established, effective prior to the closing of this offering, an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors is described below. Members will serve on these committees until their resignation or until as otherwise determined by our board of directors.

Our audit committee will, effective prior to the closing of this offering, consist of Erik Blachford, J. William Gurley and Gregory B. Maffei, with Mr. Maffei serving as Chair. Our audit committee will oversee our corporate accounting and financial reporting process and internal accounting and financial controls and audits of the financial statements. Our audit committee will also evaluate the independent auditors qualifications, independence and performance; engage and provide for the compensation of the independent auditor; establish the policies and procedures for the retention of the independent auditor to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; review our annual audited financial statements; review our critical accounting policies, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; discuss with management and

the independent auditor the results of the annual audit and the reviews of our quarterly unaudited financial statements; and review related-person transactions that would be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Our board of directors has determined that each of our audit committee members meets the requirements for independence and financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market. In making this determination, our board of directors considered that Benchmark Capital, where Mr. Gurley serves as a General Partner, beneficially owns more than 10% of our Class A common stock. However, because Benchmark Capitals ownership represents less than 2.5% of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock as of May 31, 2011, our board of directors concluded that such beneficial ownership does not cause Benchmark Capital or Mr. Gurley to be an affiliate of our company that would impair Mr. Gurleys independence as a member of our audit committee. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Maffei is an audit committee financial expert as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The audit committee will operate under a written charter to be effective prior to the closing of this offering that satisfies the applicable rules of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of The Nasdaq Global Market.

Our compensation committee will, effective prior to the closing of this offering, consist of Erik Blachford, Jay C. Hoag and Gordon Stephenson, with Mr. Hoag serving as Chair. Our compensation committee will review our overall compensation philosophy and related policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our officers and employees, including reviewing and approving goals and objectives relevant to compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers, evaluating the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives, setting compensation of these officers based on such evaluations and otherwise overseeing our compensation plans, policies and programs for our executive officers. The compensation committee will also administer the issuance of stock options and other awards under our stock plans. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under the applicable rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Market and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The compensation committee will operate under a written charter to be effective prior to the closing of this offering that satisfies the applicable listing requirements and rules of The Nasdaq Global Market.

Our nominating and governance committee will, effective prior to the closing of this offering, consist of J. William Gurley and Gordon Stephenson, with Mr. Gurley serving as Chair. The nominating and governance committee will be responsible for overseeing evaluations of our board and its committees and making recommendations regarding candidates to serve on our board of directors and the size and composition of our board. In making such recommendations, the nominating and governance committee will consider director selection guidelines approved by our board of directors. In addition, the nominating and governance committee will be responsible for overseeing our governance guidelines and reporting and making recommendations concerning governance matters. The nominating and governance committee will operate under a written charter to be effective prior to the closing of this offering that satisfies the applicable listing requirements and rules of The Nasdaq Global Market.

Prior to this offering, we had not implemented a formal policy with respect to compensation payable to our non-employee directors for service as directors. We currently do not provide any cash compensation to our non-employee directors. From time to time, we have granted stock options to our non-employee directors for their service on our board of directors. We do, however, reimburse our directors for expenses associated with attending meetings of our board and meetings of committees of our board.

The following table provides information regarding stock options granted to certain of our non-employee directors during 2010. We did not pay cash or other non-equity compensation to our non-employee directors during 2010. Directors who are also our employees receive no additional compensation for their service as a

director. During 2010, Mr. Rascoff, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink were employees. Their compensation is discussed under the heading Executive Compensation.

Following the closing of this offering, we intend to implement a formal policy pursuant to which our non-employee directors will be eligible to receive equity awards as compensation for service on our board of directors and committees of our board of directors. Under this policy, we intend to grant non-employee directors an annual stock option grant having a Black-Scholes-Merton value on the date of grant equal to $100,000. We intend that the date of grant for these stock options will be March 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2012. The stock options will be granted for prior service and will be fully vested upon grant.

During our 2010 fiscal year, our compensation committee consisted of Richard Barton, Erik Blachford and Lloyd Frink. Messrs. Barton and Frink have each served, and continue to serve, as our officers. As described in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Investors Rights Agreement, Messrs. Barton, Frink and Blachford have registration rights pursuant to an investors rights agreement entered into with us and various other shareholders. As described in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Indemnification of Officers and Directors, we will indemnify Messrs. Barton, Frink and Blachford in their capacities as officers, as applicable, and directors pursuant to our amended and restated articles and amended and restated bylaws that will become effective in connection with the closing of this offering and separate indemnification agreements. Further, Phillip Frink, the father of Lloyd Frink, is President of First Washington Corporation, which is a co-managing underwriter of this offering, as noted in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions  Other Transactions.

As noted above, prior to the closing of this offering, our compensation committee will be reconstituted and will consist of Erik Blachford, Jay C. Hoag and Gordon Stephenson. None of these directors are or have at any time in the past been one of our officers or employees.

None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee.

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, effective prior to the closing of this offering, that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including those officers responsible for financial reporting. The code of business conduct and ethics will be available on our website at www.zillow.com. We will disclose on our website any amendments to the code or any waivers of its requirements.

The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information about the compensation for our named executive officers who are included below in the 2010 Summary Compensation Table, including an analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation provided. For 2010, our named executive officers are:

In late 2010 and again in March 2011, we made several internal changes in the positions held by certain of our executive officers. In September 2010, Mr. Rascoff was promoted to Chief Executive Officer from Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Barton, who served as our Chief Executive Officer from December 2004 to September 2010, became our Executive Chairman. In March 2011, Mr. Cohen was promoted to Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer from Corporate Controller and Vice President of Finance. Also in March 2011, in addition to his position as President, Mr. Frink assumed the position of Vice Chairman after previously serving as Chief Strategy Officer. In September 2010, Mr. Schwartz was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer from Vice President of Sales. During 2010, no individual held the title of Chief Financial Officer although Mr. Cohen served in the capacity of principal financial officer during that year.

We believe our success largely depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees to operate our company in a dynamic and changing market and enable us to continue to grow our business. We compete with many other companies in seeking to attract and retain a skilled management team. To meet this challenge, the objectives of our compensation program are to:

How We Have Set Executive Compensation

Since August 2005, pursuant to delegation from our board of directors, the compensation committee of our board of directors has generally been responsible for setting our overall executive compensation strategy and for making determinations with respect to executive compensation. This has included establishing and annually

reviewing the compensation of our executive officers and overseeing our equity plan to ensure that our total compensation program is reasonable and competitive. On a limited basis, our board of directors has also made compensation decisions when the compensation committee deemed it to be appropriate. During 2010, our compensation committee was comprised of Mr. Blachford and our co-founders, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink.

Our compensation committee has historically sought and considered input from our current Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Rascoff, regarding the compensation and performance of the executive officers other than himself. Mr. Rascoff has recommended base salary increases and equity awards to the compensation committee, and has advised the compensation committee regarding our compensation programs ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. Mr. Rascoffs recommendations reflect compensation levels that he believes are commensurate with an executive officers individual qualifications, experience, level of responsibility, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as our resources and performance. Our compensation committee considers Mr. Rascoffs recommendations in approving compensation for our executive officers. Mr. Rascoff regularly attends meetings of the compensation committee, except where his own compensation is being discussed. Mr. Rascoff makes no recommendations to our board of directors or the compensation committee regarding his own compensation.

To date, our board of directors and the compensation committee have not retained a compensation consultant and have not benchmarked total compensation or any individual components of compensation against specific comparable companies. From time to time our board of directors and the compensation committee have reviewed and considered various market data, including Benchmark Capital compensation surveys for 2006 and 2007, which provide compensation information by position at privately held companies. These surveys were used primarily as a reference point and as one factor among many. In setting executive compensation, the compensation committee has relied on its collective experience and knowledge, its past practices, our overall performance, input from Mr. Rascoff and other considerations it has deemed relevant. To date, the compensation committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies for allocating compensation between long-term and short-term compensation or between cash and equity compensation.

Following the closing of this offering, we expect that the specific direction, emphasis and components of our executive compensation program will continue to evolve as will our process for establishing executive compensation. In the future, the compensation committee may retain a compensation consultant to advise us regarding our compensation program and we may begin to assess our executive compensation program against that of comparable companies, including through the use of market compensation data.

Our executive compensation program has historically been comprised of base salaries and equity compensation in the form of stock options, with limited use of cash bonuses, except in the circumstances described below in Cash Bonuses. Historically, compensation decisions for our executive officers have been highly individualized and based on a variety of factors. As a private company, we have emphasized the use of equity to incentivize our executive officers to focus on our growth and create long-term shareholder value. In light of their current stock holdings in our company, our co-founders, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink, have not received any equity compensation awards to date and, in an effort to conserve cash resources, each received only $1.00 in annual salary from October 2008 to September 2010.

Base Salaries.    Base salaries provide our executive officers with a fixed amount of consistent compensation and, in conjunction with equity awards, are a significant motivating factor in attracting and retaining our executive officers. We have designed base salaries to be competitive while also seeking to manage our cash resources.

At the time an executive officer is first hired, base salary is generally initially established through individual negotiations between us and the executive officer, taking into account subjective judgments as to the executive

The compensation committee annually reviews the base salaries of our executive officers. Merit-based adjustments to salary generally become effective in the first quarter of the year following completion of our annual performance review process which includes a comprehensive self performance review as well as a manager and peer review. Adjustments to base salaries also may occur in connection with promotions. In October 2010, Mr. Rascoffs annual base salary was increased to $270,000 in connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer, and in August 2010, Mr. Cohens salary was increased to $170,000 in connection with his promotion to Vice President of Finance. Additionally, in connection with the internal changes to certain executive positions made in September 2010, we determined that it was appropriate at that time for Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink to each resume receiving annual base salaries to compensate them for their continued employment. In September 2010, each of Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink began to receive base salaries of $135,000 and $230,000, respectively, after each having received annual salaries of $1.00 since October 2008. These salaries were set at amounts that took into account the job responsibilities to be undertaken by each of them.

The annual base salaries for the named executive officers are listed below. In September 2010 and March 2011, annual base salaries for the named executive officers were approved at the following amounts, based on a subjective evaluation of executive officer performance and the other factors described above. For Mr. Cohen, this also included a salary increase resulting from his promotion to Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Rascoff and Mr. Schwartz both received merit increases in 2011.

Cash Bonuses.    To date we have not established a formal cash incentive plan for our executive officers or otherwise awarded performance-based cash bonuses, with a limited exception described below. As a private company, we have relied primarily on the long-term incentive value of stock options, which also has allowed us to conserve cash.

While we do not offer a cash incentive plan for all our executive officers, pursuant to the terms of his initial employment arrangement with us, Mr. Schwartz, our Chief Revenue Officer, is eligible to receive quarterly cash bonuses based on revenues, determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, compared to his revenue objectives. Mr. Schwartz is eligible to receive a maximum payout of $12,500 per quarter ($50,000 per year), which is payable if revenues meet or exceed his revenue objective for the quarter. If the revenue objective is not met, the quarterly payment is based on the percentage that actual revenues comprise in relation to the objective. For 2010, the revenues for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters were $5.3 million, $7.3 million, $8.2 million, and $9.6 million, respectively. We believe this type and amount of compensation for a principal sales executive was reasonable in order to secure and retain the employment of Mr. Schwartz. The maximum amounts payable to Mr. Schwartz under this arrangement have not been modified since he was first hired in 2007 and for 2010, at maximum payout, comprised less than 25% of his annual base salary for that year. Mr. Schwartz has achieved on average at least 96% of the maximum annual payout he can earn under this arrangement in the last two prior fiscal years.

During 2010, our board of directors (with Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink abstaining) also determined to award one-time bonuses of $195,834 to each of our co-founders, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink. These bonus amounts were awarded in the subjective discretion of our board in recognition of our founders strong leadership, hard work and longstanding commitment to the company and to continue to retain and motivate them.

Equity-Based Compensation.    Since our inception, equity-based compensation in the form of stock options has been an integral component of our compensation program for all our employees, with the exception of our co-founders, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink, who have not received any form of equity compensation to date in light of their current stock holdings. Our board and compensation committee believe that stock options play a significant role in our ability to attract, motivate, and incentivize the executive talent necessary to accomplish our business objectives, and also provide our employees with a significant long-term interest in our success by rewarding the creation of shareholder value. Vesting for stock options is based on continued employment with us, generally over four years, thereby also encouraging the retention of our executive officers.

Historically, we have not applied a formula to determine the size of individual stock options granted to our named executive officers. Instead, our compensation committee has generally determined the size of individual grants using its collective business judgment and experience, taking into account, among other factors, the role and responsibility of the individual executive officer, the competitive market for the executives position, the size and value of existing equity awards and a subjective evaluation of individual performance and prior contributions to us. Based upon these factors, the compensation committee sets the size of each stock option award at a level it considers appropriate to create a meaningful incentive. No specific weight is given to any one of the foregoing factors, although larger awards are typically granted to executive officers with duties and responsibilities that are more likely to have a larger impact on the creation of long-term shareholder value. To date, stock options are the only type of equity award we have granted to our executive officers.

Our executive officers generally receive a stock option grant in connection with their hiring. Following each annual performance review, we historically have granted additional stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers (other than Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink), in the first quarter of the year following completion of our annual performance review. The compensation committee also may grant additional stock options from time to time to retain executive officers and reward them for promotions or performance.

Stock options have a seven-year term and generally vest over four years, with 25% vesting after one year from the date of grant and the remainder vesting over 36 months in equal monthly installments, subject to the executive officers continued employment. Our policy is to grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the current fair market value of our Class A common stock. Since July 2006, we have determined the fair market value of our Class A common stock based on valuation analyses prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm. Certain stock option grants to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rascoff, and one option grant to Mr. Schwartz made in connection with his initial hire, provide for double-trigger acceleration, as described in greater detail under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.

In March 2010, each of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink) received stock option grants following our annual performance review process for the following number of shares: Mr. Rascoff, 118,343 shares; Mr. Cohen, 14,792 shares; Mr. Beitel, 51,775 shares; and Mr. Schwartz, 29,585 shares. In determining the size of the foregoing grants, the compensation committee considered the factors described above using its collective business judgment and experience. In particular, for Mr. Rascoff, the compensation committee considered his long-standing service with us in leadership roles, his responsibilities over the prior year and the desire to incentivize and retain Mr. Rascoff. Mr. Cohens grant size was largely based on his contributions and level of responsibility in his then current position as our Controller, prior to his promotion to Vice President, Finance and then Chief Financial Officer. Both Mr. Beitel and Mr. Schwartz oversee substantial portions of our business. Mr. Beitel oversees a substantial number of employees in his position as Chief Technology Officer and Mr. Schwartz is largely responsible for revenue development. The grant sizes to each of these individuals reflected the compensation committees assessment of grant sizes it felt appropriate to recognize their levels of responsibilities and contributions during the past year and to retain and incentivize them for the future.

In light of promotions during 2010 or increased job responsibilities, additional stock options were granted to the following named executive officers during 2010: Mr. Rascoff, 118,343 shares; Mr. Cohen, 44,378 shares; and Mr. Schwartz, 59,171 shares.

During March 2011, stock options were granted following our annual performance review to the following named executive officers for the following numbers of shares:

Upon completion of this offering, the compensation committee may utilize competitive market data as a tool to determine equity award grant amounts and may consider the use of alternative types of equity awards, such as restricted stock units, or a mix of equity awards, for our executive officers.

Other Executive Benefits.    Our named executive officers generally receive health and welfare benefits under the same programs and subject to the same terms and conditions as our other salaried employees. These benefits include medical, dental and vision benefits, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and basic life insurance. Our named executive officers also are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan.

Historically, we have not provided significant perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers, except that certain of our named executive officers receive paid parking, the value of which was less than $10,000 in 2010. We do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program and do not expect that they will become a significant element of our compensation program in the future.

We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Rascoff, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Cohen, our Chief Financial Officer, to assist in the retention of the services of these executive officers and to help them maintain their focus and dedication to their responsibilities to maximize shareholder value in the event of a transaction that could result in a change of control of our company. The employment agreements will become effective upon the closing of this offering. Each employment agreement provides that employment with us is at will.

The employment agreements provide the following severance payments and benefits if the executive officers employment is terminated by us without cause (as defined in the employment agreement) or if he resigns for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), including such a termination within 18 months after a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement):

To the extent Mr. Rascoff holds stock options as of the effective date of his employment agreement that, pursuant to their original terms, provide for greater acceleration of vesting upon certain terminations of employment following a change of control, the original vesting acceleration provisions for such options will continue to apply. The vesting acceleration provisions applicable to certain stock options held by Mr. Rascoff are described below under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.

As a condition to receiving any severance payments or benefits under the employment agreements, Mr. Rascoff and Mr. Cohen must execute a general release and waiver of all claims against us in a form satisfactory to us. Mr. Rascoff and Mr. Cohen must also continue to comply with the applicable terms of their confidentiality and noncompetition agreements. The employment agreements and employment terminate automatically upon death or total disability of the executive officer.

If any payments or benefits payable under the employment agreements will be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we will pay to the executive officer either (a) the full amount of such payments or benefits or (b) the full amount reduced by the minimum amount necessary to prevent any portion from being an excess parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G, whichever results, on an after-tax basis, in the greater amount payable to the executive officer.

At this time, our board of directors has not adopted stock ownership guidelines with respect to the named executive officers although it may consider doing so in the future. In connection with this offering, we will establish an insider trading compliance policy that will prohibit, among other actions, short sales and hedging of stock ownership positions.

Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to a public corporation for annual compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to its principal executive officer and the three other most highly compensated named executive officers (excluding the principal financial officer). Compensation that qualifies as performance-based is excluded for purposes of calculating the amount of compensation subject to the $1.0 million limit. In addition, in the case of a privately held corporation that becomes a public corporation, the $1.0 million limit generally does not apply to compensation paid pursuant to a compensation plan or agreement that existed prior to the initial public offering. However, a newly public corporation only may rely on this particular exception until the earliest of the following events: (a) the expiration of the plan or agreement; (b) a material modification of the plan or agreement (as determined under Section 162(m) of the Code); (c) the issuance of all the employer stock and other compensation allocated under the plan; or (d) the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the year in which the initial public offering occurs.

Because we have been a privately held corporation, we have not previously taken the deductibility limit under Section 162(m) of the Code into consideration in setting compensation for our executive officers. Under the exception for newly public corporations described above, any equity-based awards granted under our 2011 Incentive Plan that we intend to implement following the offering will not be subject to the $1.0 million limit, provided such awards are made prior to the earliest of the events specified above. While our compensation committee has not adopted a policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, we expect that our compensation committee will consider tax deductibility under Section 162(m) as a factor in compensation decisions, but may be authorized to approve compensation that is not deductible if it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate our executive officers.

The following table provides information regarding the compensation of our named executive officers for 2010. Positions listed below are those currently held by the named executive officers.

The following table provides information regarding share-based awards granted to our named executive officers during 2010.

The following table provides certain information regarding outstanding equity awards held by each of our named executive officers at December 31, 2010. Other than the option awards listed below, our named executive officers held no other equity awards at December 31, 2010.

Our named executive officers did not exercise any stock options during 2010. None of the named executive officers hold any equity awards other than stock options.

We currently do not (and did not in 2010) sponsor any defined benefit pension or other actuarial plan.

We currently do not (and did not in 2010) maintain any nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plan or arrangement.

Our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005 Plan, provides that if outstanding stock options will not be assumed or substituted in a company transaction, our board of directors or the compensation committee may, in its discretion, fully or partially accelerate the vesting of all outstanding stock options. The term company transaction (including certain exclusions for related party transactions) is defined below under Employee Benefit and Stock Plans  Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan.

If stock options are assumed or substituted in a company transaction, certain stock options granted to our named executive officers will become fully vested and exercisable if their employment terminates (a) in connection with a company transaction or (b) within 18 months following a company transaction, unless, in each case, employment is terminated for cause or by the named executive officer without good reason. Of our named executive officers, Mr. Rascoff holds certain stock options with this provision and Mr. Schwartz holds one stock option with this provision. For purposes of these stock options, good reason generally means:

The following table shows the estimated value of change in control benefits that would have accrued to the named executive officers with respect to their outstanding stock options under the 2005 Plan if (a) we completed a company transaction in which outstanding stock options became fully vested and exercisable or (b) the employment of certain named executive officers terminated in connection with a company transaction in which stock options were assumed or substituted. The amounts in the table assume that the company transaction or termination of employment was effective as of December 31, 2010. The amounts are estimates of the incremental amounts that would have accrued as of December 31, 2010 in the foregoing circumstances. The actual amounts can only be determined at the time of an actual company transaction or a related termination of employment. Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink do not hold any stock options and are not included in the table below.

Our board of directors originally adopted, and our shareholders approved, the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005 Plan, on February 18, 2005. The 2005 Plan was last amended on March 10, 2011 to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance. No additional awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan after completion of this offering. After completion of this offering, outstanding options under the 2005 Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms and conditions and those of the 2005 Plan.

The principal features of the 2005 Plan are summarized below. This summary is qualified by reference to the text of the 2005 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

As of March 31, 2011, 6,908,284 shares of Class A common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2005 Plan. As of March 31, 2011, 1,263,767 shares of Class A common stock had been issued upon the exercise of options granted under the 2005 Plan, options to purchase 5,477,032 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $4.27 per share and 167,485 shares remained available for future grant under the 2005 Plan.

Our board of directors and, pursuant to authority delegated by our board, the compensation committee of our board of directors administer the 2005 Plan. Our board of directors or the compensation committee selects the individuals to be granted awards, the types of awards to be granted, the number of shares subject to awards, and the other terms, conditions and provisions of such awards. Our board or the compensation committee has the authority to amend outstanding awards under the 2005 Plan, except that such amendments generally may not materially adversely affect a participants rights under outstanding awards, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 2005 Plan.

The 2005 Plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, stock units and other stock or cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors and those of our subsidiaries, if any, and other related companies. As of

December 31, 2010, we have granted only stock options under the 2005 Plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan generally vest over four years, with 25% vesting after one year and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments thereafter. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2005 Plan must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, except in the case of options granted in connection with assuming or substituting options in acquisition transactions and except for options that meet all the requirements for awards that are considered deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan have a term of seven years from the date of grant, subject to earlier termination following a participants termination of employment or service relationship with us.

Under the 2005 Plan, unless our board or the compensation committee determines otherwise with respect to an award, in the event of a company transaction that is not a related party transaction (which terms company transaction and related party transaction are defined below), our board or the compensation committee may approve that outstanding awards will be assumed or substituted for by a successor company. If our board or compensation committee does not approve such assumption or substitution, or the successor company does not agree to assume or substitute outstanding awards, our board or the compensation committee will determine the effect of the company transaction on outstanding awards, which may include one or both of the following:

Unless otherwise defined in the instrument evidencing an award or in a written employment, services or other agreement between a participant and us, company transaction generally means the occurrence of any of the following events:

If we dissolve or liquidate, unless our board or the compensation committee determines otherwise, outstanding awards will terminate immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation.

Our board of directors has adopted, and our shareholders have approved, our 2011 Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan will become effective upon execution of the underwriting agreement for this offering.

Purpose.    The purpose of the 2011 Plan will be to attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors by providing them with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in us and to align their interests and efforts to the long-term interests of our shareholders.

Administration.    Our board or the compensation committee of our board of directors will be authorized to administer the 2011 Plan. Our board may delegate concurrent administration of the 2011 Plan to different committees consisting of two or more members of our board or to one or more senior executive officers in accordance with the 2011 Plans terms. The plan administrator will be authorized to select the individuals to be granted awards, the types of awards to be granted, the number of shares subject to awards, and the other terms, conditions and provisions of such awards. References to the committee below are, as applicable, to our board or the compensation committee, or other committee or officers that may be authorized to administer the 2011 Plan.

Eligibility.    Awards may be granted under the 2011 Plan to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors and those of our subsidiaries and other related companies.

Share Reserve.    The 2011 Plan will initially authorize the issuance of up to 1,300,000 shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, as of the effective date of the 2011 Plan, any shares not issued or subject to existing awards under our 2005 Plan, plus any shares then subject to outstanding awards under our 2005 Plan that subsequently cease to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards in shares), will automatically become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan, up to an aggregate maximum of 5,569,773 shares. The number of shares authorized under the 2011 Plan also will be increased each January starting in 2013 by an amount equal to the least of (i) 3.5% of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the end of our immediately preceding fiscal year, (ii) 3,500,000 shares, and (iii) a lesser amount determined by our board.

The following shares will be available again for issuance under the 2011 Plan:

Awards granted on assumption of or in substitution for previously granted awards by an acquired company will not reduce the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan.

If any change in our stock occurs by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination or exchange of shares, distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend or other change in our corporate or capital structure, the committee will make proportional adjustments to the maximum number and kind of securities (a) available for issuance under the 2011 Plan, (b) issuable as incentive stock options and (c) subject to any outstanding award, including the per share price of such securities.

Types of Awards.    The 2011 Plan will permit the grant of any or all of the following types of awards:

Repricing.    The 2011 Plan will permit the committee, without shareholder approval, to (a) reduce the exercise or grant price of an option or SAR after it is granted, (b) cancel an option or SAR at a time when its exercise or grant price exceeds the fair market value of the underlying stock, in exchange for cash, another option or SAR, restricted stock or other equity award or (c) take any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles.

Change of Control or Liquidation.    Under the 2011 Plan, unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing an award or in a written employment, services or other agreement between a participant and us, the following will apply in the event of a change of control (as will be defined in the 2011 Plan):

If we dissolve or liquidate, unless the committee determines otherwise, outstanding awards will terminate immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation.

Amendment and Termination.    Our board or the compensation committee will be permitted to amend the 2011 Plan or any outstanding award thereunder, except that only our board will be permitted to amend the 2011 Plan if shareholder approval of the amendment is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule. Amendment of an outstanding award generally may not materially adversely affect a participants rights under the award without the participants consent, subject to certain exceptions to be set forth in the 2011 Plan.

Our board or compensation committee may suspend or terminate all or any portion of the 2011 Plan at any time, but in such event, outstanding awards will remain outstanding in accordance with their existing terms and conditions and the 2011 Plans terms and conditions. Unless sooner terminated by our board or compensation committee, the 2011 Plan will terminate on June 16, 2021.

We maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan for all employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to defer up to 100% of their eligible compensation subject to applicable annual limits set pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We may provide a discretionary employee matching contribution and discretionary profit sharing contribution under the 401(k) plan, but we have not elected to make either type of contribution. We intend for the 401(k) plan to qualify, depending on the employees election, under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) so that contributions by employees, and income earned on those contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) plan.

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, that will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering, will provide that we will limit the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by Washington law. Washington law provides that directors of a corporation shall not be personally liable for reasonable expenses incurred in the wholly successful defense of a proceeding to which the director was a party because of being a director. Washington law provides further that directors may be indemnified against liability incurred in a proceeding to which they are a party because of being a director so long as:

Directors generally may not, however, be indemnified:

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our amended and restated bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer or director for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us, regardless of whether our bylaws permit such indemnification.

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers to the fullest extent allowed under Washington law. These agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify our directors and certain of our officers for certain expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts reasonably incurred by such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in our right, on account of any services undertaken by such person on our behalf or that persons status as a director or officer of Zillow.

There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is required or requested, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that would reasonably be expected to result in a claim for indemnification.

We describe below transactions and series of similar transactions, since January 1, 2008, to which we were a party or will be a party, in which:

Concurrent with the closing of this offering, funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities and an affiliate of Jay C. Hoag, a non-employee director, and PAR Investment Partners, L.P., a beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities, will purchase from us in a private placement the number of shares of our Class A common stock with an aggregate purchase price equal to approximately $5.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, this would be 323,527 shares. The sale of these shares will not be registered in this offering. We refer to the private placement of these shares of Class A common stock as the concurrent private placement. The funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures, and PAR Investment Partners, L.P., will be entitled to registration rights with respect to these shares under the investors rights agreement described below.

We are party to an investors rights agreement with a group of our shareholders that includes our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, who are both executive officers and members of our board of directors and beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities, Gregory B. Maffei and Erik Blachford, who are both non-employee directors, Benchmark Capital Partners V, L.P., a beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities and an affiliate of J. William Gurley, a non-employee director, TCV V, L.P. and TCV Member Fund, L.P., together, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities and an affiliate of Jay C. Hoag, a non-employee director, and PAR Investment Partners, L.P., a beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities. Subject to the terms and conditions of the investors rights agreement and after the expiration of the lock-up provisions with the underwriters described elsewhere in this prospectus, these shareholders have registration rights with respect to the shares of our capital stock they, or certain of their affiliates, hold, including the right to demand that we file a registration statement or request that their shares be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing. For a more detailed description of these rights, see Description of Capital Stock  Registration Rights.

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will become effective in connection with the closing of this offering will limit the liability of each of our directors and will provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Washington law. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers. See Executive Compensation  Limitations on Liability and Indemnification Matters for a general description of these provisions.

Phillip Frink, the father of Lloyd Frink, an executive officer and a member of our board of directors, is President of First Washington Corporation. First Washington Corporation is a co-managing underwriter of this offering.

We have entered into an employment agreement with Kathleen Philips, our General Counsel, which will become effective upon the closing of this offering. The terms of Ms. Philipss employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the employment agreements described above under Executive Compensation  Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Employment Agreements. Ms. Philipss employment agreement also provides that she will be eligible to receive $65,000, representing the second half of an initial hiring bonus, on the one-year anniversary of her employment with us. If Ms. Philips voluntarily terminates employment with us prior to July 11, 2012, she will be required to reimburse us $65,000 of the hiring bonus received as of such termination date, with certain exceptions to reimbursement in the event Ms. Philipss employment terminates under circumstances in which she would be eligible to receive severance payments and benefits under the employment agreement.

Policies and Procedures for the Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons

Our board of directors has adopted a written policy to be effective upon the closing of this offering for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Under the policy, all of our directors and executive officers and all of our beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock are expected to disclose to our general counsel the material facts of any transaction that could potentially be considered a related person transaction promptly on gaining knowledge that the transaction may occur or has occurred. The audit committee is authorized to administer this policy, and may amend, modify, and interpret this policy.

A related person transaction generally is defined under the policy as any transaction required to be disclosed under the SECs related person transaction disclosure requirement of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

Any potential related person transaction reported to or otherwise made known to the general counsel will be reviewed under the policy according to the following procedures:

When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the chairperson of the audit committee or the audit committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including:

If any related person transaction is ongoing or is part of a series of transactions, the chairperson or the audit committee, as applicable, may establish guidelines as necessary to appropriately review the ongoing transaction. After initial approval or ratification of the transaction, the chairperson or the audit committee, as applicable, will review the transaction on a regular basis (at least annually).

If any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the audit committee may take such action as it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the company.

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock at May 31, 2011, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of Class A common stock offered by us in this offering and the concurrent private placement, for

Unless otherwise noted, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is Zillow, Inc., 999 Third Avenue, Suite 4600, Seattle, Washington 98104.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.

Applicable percentage ownership is based on 13,706,147 shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2011, which assumes the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock and the automatic conversion of all shares of our Class C common stock into 2,305,980 shares of our Class A common stock, both to be converted upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2011. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed that 17,491,674 shares of Class A common stock and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock will be outstanding upon closing of this offering and the concurrent private placement. In computing the number of shares of Class A common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of Class A common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2011 and the number of shares of Class B common stock held by that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

The following description of our capital stock and provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering. Copies of these documents will be included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The descriptions below of our capital stock reflect changes that will occur on or prior to the closing of this offering.

Upon the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will be 645,000,000 shares, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share, consisting of the following three classes of stock:

As of March 31, 2011, we had outstanding 13,644,750 shares of Class A common stock, held of record by 208 shareholders (which assumes the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock, and all outstanding shares of our Class C common stock into 2,305,980 shares of our Class A common stock, both to be effected upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part), and 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock, held of record by two shareholders. In addition, as of March 31, 2011, 5,477,032 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $4.27 per share. Upon the closing of the offering and the concurrent private placement, we will have 17,430,277 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option and no exercise of outstanding stock options.

Since Zillows inception, we have had authorized Class A common stock, which has one vote per share, and authorized Class B common stock, which has ten votes per share. On any matter that is submitted to a vote of our shareholders, the holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share of Class A common stock and the holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share of Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single group on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of shareholders, unless otherwise required by law or our amended and restated articles of incorporation.

Under Washington law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation, holders of our Class A common stock and holders of our Class B common stock may each be entitled to vote as a separate voting group, or as a separate voting group with other classes that are affected in the same or a substantially similar way, on a proposed amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation that would:

Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single voting group, will be entitled to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they so choose.

After this offering and the concurrent private placement, all of our Class B common stock will be controlled by our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, and will represent 84.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of our dual class structure, for the foreseeable future our founders will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors (with or without cause).

Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to share equally in any dividends that our board of directors may declare from time to time unless different treatment is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, each voting as a separate voting group. If a dividend is paid in the form of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, then holders of Class A common stock will receive Class A common stock and holders of Class B common stock will receive Class B common stock.

Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to share ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Class A common stock then held by each (assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock) in our assets available for distribution to the shareholders after the payment of any liabilities and the liquidation preferences on any outstanding preferred stock.

Our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are not redeemable.

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that no preemptive rights shall exist with respect to shares of our stock or securities convertible into shares of our stock, except to the extent provided by written agreement.

All of the Class B common stock is currently held by Richard Barton or Lloyd Frink, each of whom we refer to in this Conversion section as a founder. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for (i) certain transfers described in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, so long as the founder who transfers the Class B common stock continues to hold exclusive voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares transferred or (ii) transfers between the founders or entities through which a founder holds exclusive voting and dispositive power with respect to the Class B common stock.

In the event of the death or mental disability of a founder, each share of such founders Class B common stock will convert into one share of Class A common stock, except as set forth below. If a founder (whom we refer to as the transferring founder), or an entity that holds Class B common stock with respect to which such founder holds exclusive voting and dispositive power, transfers voting control of shares of Class B common stock to the other founder contingent or effective upon the transferring founders death or mental disability, then the transferring founders death or mental disability will not immediately trigger a conversion to Class A common stock, provided that the shares of Class B common stock as to which voting control was transferred shall convert to Class A common stock no later than nine months after the death or mental disability of the transferring founder. Further, if one founder dies or becomes mentally disabled simultaneously with when the other founder dies or becomes mentally disabled, the founders death or mental disability will not immediately trigger a conversion to Class A common stock if voting control of the founders shares of Class B common stock is transferred to a trustee designated by the founders and approved by the board of directors, provided that the shares of Class B common stock as to which voting control was transferred shall convert to Class A common stock no later than nine months after the death or mental disability of the founders.

Once converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock may not be reissued.

Except for the issuance of Class B common stock in connection with dividends or distributions in accordance with the amended and restated articles of incorporation, we will not issue additional shares of Class B common stock unless the issuance is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, each voting as a separate voting group.

Immediately prior to the closing of this offering and the concurrent private placement, our outstanding convertible preferred stock will be converted into 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock. After such conversion and pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series, including preferred stock with voting, conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of other shares of our capital stock, without further action by shareholders, other than approval by or written agreement of holders of at least a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock, which is held by our two founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink (which we refer to as the approval right), or in lieu of such approval or written agreement, approval by our board of directors including a founder in his capacity as a member of our board of directors. The approval right will terminate when the Class B common stock represents less than 7% of the aggregate number of shares of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to this approval right, our board of directors will also have the authority to fix the voting rights, limitations and relative rights of any series of preferred stock, including dividend rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights, conversion rights and voting rights. The issuance of preferred stock may decrease the market price of the Class A common stock. We have no plans at this time to issue any preferred stock.

We are party to an investors rights agreement with significant holders of our convertible preferred stock (which preferred stock will be converted into 9,276,190 shares of our Class A common stock in connection with this offering), who we refer to in this section as the eligible investors, and Richard Barton, Lloyd Frink, the Barton Descendants Trust and the Frink Descendants Trust, who we refer to collectively in this Registration Rights section as our founders. Under this agreement, the eligible investors and our founders are entitled to the registration rights described below with respect to an aggregate of 20,475,239 shares of our Class A common stock (assuming conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock and Class C common stock in connection with this offering, and conversion of Class B common stock) and the shares purchased by funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures, and by PAR Investment Partners, L.P., in the concurrent private

placement, which we refer to in this section as the registrable securities. These registration rights enable the eligible investors and our founders to offer and sell registered shares of our Class A common stock, after the expiration of the lock-up provisions described elsewhere in this prospectus, without restriction (including in public markets) under the Securities Act when the applicable registration statement is declared effective.

We are required to pay for all expenses, other than underwriting discounts, commissions and stock transfer taxes, incurred in connection with the registration of the registrable securities. Under the investors rights agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the holders of the registrable securities against specified liabilities under state and federal securities laws, including liabilities under the Securities Act. No holder of registrable securities will be entitled to registration rights under the investors rights agreement after the earlier of (a) five years after the closing of this offering, or (b) as to any holder, the time after this offering at which the holder holds 1% or less of our outstanding Class A common stock and all registrable securities held by the holder can be sold in any three-month period without registration in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

Pursuant to the investors rights agreement, the eligible investors and our founders are entitled to the demand registration rights described in this section. At any time beginning after the six-month anniversary of this offering, any one of the three largest holders of our convertible preferred stock prior to this offering, who we refer to in this section as the major investors, or one or more of our founders holding in the aggregate at least 30% of our Class B common stock, including for this purpose, any Class A common stock issued in conversion of such Class B common stock, may request that we register all or a portion of their registrable securities so long as the anticipated aggregate offering price is in excess of $20 million. In that case, all of the eligible investors and our founders will be entitled to participate in the registration. We will not be required to effect a demand registration during the period beginning 90 days prior to the filing, and ending 180 days following the effectiveness, of a registration statement we initiate relating to a public offering of our securities. Subject to specified conditions, we may defer a demand registration for up to 90 days in a 12-month period. Further, we will not be required to effect a demand registration for a major investor if we have previously effected two demand registrations initiated by one or more major investors. Similarly, we will not be required to effect a demand registration for one of our founders if we have previously effected two demand registrations initiated by one or more of our founders. In an underwritten offering, the underwriter has the right, subject to conditions, to limit the number of registrable securities that the eligible investors and our founders may include in the registration. In that case, the number of shares that may be included in the underwritten offering will be apportioned between the eligible investors and our founders so that the eligible investors may include 65% of the total number of securities to be included in the offering and our founders may include 35% of the total number of securities to be included in the offering.

The eligible investors and our founders may elect to include their registrable securities in any registration statement we file under the Securities Act to register any of our securities, subject to exceptions, and also to include those shares in any underwritten offering contemplated by that registration statement. We are not required to include in any registration and underwriting the shares that the holders elect to include in a registration statement where the underwriter determines in good faith that the inclusion of the shares would jeopardize the success of the offering, so long as the total number of shares of the holders included in the offering is not reduced below 30% of the total number of registrable securities included in the offering. In the event the underwriter determines to limit the participation of the eligible investors and our founders, the shares those holders may include in the registration will be apportioned between the eligible investors and our founders so that the eligible investors may include 65% of the total number of securities to be offered by those holders and our founders may include 35% of the total number of securities to be offered by those holders. In connection with this offering, the eligible investors and our founders were entitled, and those holders representing the necessary percentage of registrable securities waived their rights, to include their shares of registrable securities in this offering.

If and when we become eligible to file registration statements on Form S-3, the eligible investors and our founders may require us, upon request of a major investor or one or more of our founders holding an aggregate of at least 30% of our Class B common stock, including, for this purpose, any Class A common stock issued in conversion of such Class B common stock, to file additional registration statements on Form S-3 to register their registrable securities so long as the proposed aggregate offering amount is at least $10 million for each registration. We do not have to effect a Form S-3 registration in response to a major investors request if we have, within the preceding 12-month period, already effected two Form S-3 registrations at the request of one or more major investors. Similarly, we do not have to effect a Form S-3 registration in response to a founders request if we have, within the preceding 12-month period, already effected two Form S-3 registrations at the request of one or more of our founders. In addition, subject to specified conditions, we may defer a Form S-3 registration for up to 90 days in a 12-month period.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Washington Law

Provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Washington law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would benefit our shareholders. These provisions, which are summarized below, may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of our company that a shareholder might consider in the shareholders best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our shareholders. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by our board of directors and to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for a takeover that does not contemplate the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares, or an unsolicited proposal for our restructuring or sale of all or part of our business. Some of these provisions will become effective only after the date, which we refer to as the threshold date, on which the Class B common stock held by our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, represents less than 7% of the aggregate number of shares of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

As discussed above, our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, while our Class A common stock, which is the class of stock we are selling in this offering and in the concurrent private placement, and which will be the only class of stock which is publicly traded, has one vote per share. After this offering and the concurrent private placement, all of our Class B common stock will be controlled by our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, and will represent 84.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of our dual class structure, for the foreseeable future our founders will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of us or of our assets. In addition, until the threshold date our founders will be able to call meetings of shareholders and fill vacancies on the board, and directors may be removed with or without cause. The concentrated control described above could also delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other shareholders may support, and could discourage a potential acquiror from initiating such a transaction.

Authorized but Unissued Shares of Class A Common Stock and Preferred Stock

Our authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock are available for our board of directors to issue without shareholder approval (except to the extent described above under Preferred Stock). To the extent described above in Preferred Stock, our board of directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly, could adversely affect the rights of holders of Class A common stock and could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change of control or

make removal of management more difficult. We may use the additional authorized shares of Class A common stock or preferred stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or other transaction.

Classified Board of Directors; Election and Removal of Directors

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for the division of our board of directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the directors in each class serving for three-year terms, and one class being elected annually by our shareholders. Prior to the threshold date, our directors can be removed with or without cause by holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single group, and vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by such shareholders voting together as a single group, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by the sole remaining director. After the threshold date, our directors can be removed only for cause and vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by the sole remaining director. Further, both before and after the threshold date, only our board of directors may change the size of our board of directors. Because, after the threshold date, this system of electing, appointing and removing directors generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our board of directors, it may discourage a third party from initiating a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of our company, and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors.

Limits on Ability of Shareholders to Act by Written Consent or Call Special Meetings of Shareholders

Washington law limits the ability of shareholders of public companies from acting by written consent by requiring unanimous written consent for a shareholder action to be effective. This limit on the ability of our shareholders to act by less than unanimous written consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take shareholder actions. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president or (prior to the threshold date) holders of at least 25% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. After the threshold date, only the chairman of our board of directors, our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president may call a special meeting of shareholders.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to bring business before a meeting of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders, must provide us with timely written notice of their proposal. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholders notice. These provisions may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from making nominations for directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.

Amendment to Our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation

Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that shareholders can amend or repeal the bylaws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single group.

Unless approved by a majority of our continuing directors, as that term is defined in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, specified provisions of our articles of incorporation may not be amended or

repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote on the action, including the following provisions:

Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, unless (a) the significant business transaction or the acquiring persons purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporations board of directors prior to the acquiring persons share acquisition or (b) the significant business transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporations board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring persons shares or shares over which the acquiring person has voting control) at or subsequent to the acquiring persons share acquisition. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting securities of the target corporation. Significant business transactions include, among other transactions:

After the five-year period, significant business transactions are permitted, as long as they comply with the fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. A corporation may not opt out of this statute.

Upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be BNY Mellon Shareowner Services.

We have applied to have our Class A common stock approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol Z.

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock, and although we expect that our Class A common stock will be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, an active public market for our Class A common stock may not develop following this offering. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales by our existing shareholders of shares of Class A common stock, or the availability of shares of Class A common stock for sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales by our existing shareholders of substantial amounts of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.

Upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement, based on our shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011, and after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock and Class C common stock into shares of Class A common stock, we will have 17,430,277 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and, 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase additional shares and no exercise of outstanding options. Of the outstanding shares, all of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that (1) any shares held or acquired by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, will be subject to the volume limitations and other restrictions of Rule 144 described below and (2) any person buying shares through the directed share program has agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, he or she will not, without the prior written consent of Citi, dispose of or hedge any shares purchased in the program. The remaining 14,067,826 shares of Class A common stock, including the 323,527 shares to be issued in the concurrent private placement, and the 9,528,313 shares of Class B common stock, will be restricted securities as defined under Rule 144 and also will be subject to the lock-up provisions described below or similar market standoff agreements between us and our shareholders. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration, including, among others, the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which are summarized below.

In general, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our Class A common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell his or her shares provided that (1) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months before, the sale and (2) we have been subject to and satisfied the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. If such person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then such person is entitled to sell the shares regardless of whether we have been subject to and satisfied the Exchange Act reporting requirements.

A person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our Class A common stock for at least six months, but who is one of our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the 90 days before, the sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:

provided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. Such sales by affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale and notice provisions of Rule 144.

In general, under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, a person who purchased shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates during the immediately preceding 90 days may sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information requirements or holding period requirements of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required to wait until 90 days after we have become subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements before selling their shares.

As of March 31, 2011, 1,223,087 shares of our outstanding Class A common stock had been issued in reliance on Rule 701 as a result of stock option exercises. All of these shares are subject to the lock-up agreements described below or similar market standoff agreements with us.

We, our officers and directors and substantially all of our shareholders have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Citi, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock. Citi in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.

If, however, at any time beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, (i) we have filed with the SEC at least one quarterly report on Form 10-Q, (ii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market is at least 33% greater than the initial public offering price per share set forth on the cover page of this prospectus for 20 trading days out of any 30 trading day period ending after the 90th day following the date of this prospectus (which 30 trading day period may begin prior to such 90th day), and (iii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on the last day of that 30 trading day period described in clause (ii) is at least 25% greater than the initial public offering price, then 25% of each holders capital stock that is subject to the 180-day restrictions described above as of immediately prior to the opening of The Nasdaq Global Market on the day following the end of the 30 trading day period, or the initial release date, will be automatically released from those restrictions on the initial release date, provided that none of the underwriters named under the section entitled Underwriting in this prospectus has published research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date. If an underwriter of this offering has published research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date, the initial release date will be deferred until the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on, and including, the date such research is published. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to our company occurs during the last 17-day period of the 180-day restricted period or the last 17-day period prior to the initial release date, or (ii) prior to the initial release date or the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the initial release date or the last day of the 180-day restricted period, then, in either case, the initial release date will be deferred or the 180-day restricted period will be extended, as applicable, and the restrictions of the lock-up agreements will continue to apply, until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on, and including, the issuance of the earnings release or material news or occurrence of the material event, unless Citi waives, in writing, such extension or deferral.

In addition, each person buying shares through the directed share program has agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, he or she will not, without the prior written consent of Citi, dispose of or hedge any shares purchased in the program.

Pursuant to an investors rights agreement, the holders of approximately 20,151,712 shares of our Class A common stock (including shares issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock and our Class C common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering and assuming the conversion of our Class B common stock at the option of the holders thereof), or their transferees, will be entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of the offer and sale of those shares under the Securities Act. For a description of these registration rights, see Description of Capital Stock  Registration Rights. If the offer and sale of these shares is registered, the shares will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, and a large number of shares may be sold into the public market. If such sale occurs, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition, in connection with the concurrent private placement, we have agreed to extend certain registration rights, after the expiration of the lockup provisions described elsewhere in this prospectus, to funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures and to PAR Investment Partners, L.P., pursuant to which, under certain conditions, we will register shares of our Class A common stock held by funds affiliated with Technology Crossover Ventures and by PAR Investment Partners, L.P., for resale on a registration statement on Form S-3.

As of March 31, 2011, options to purchase a total of 5,477,032 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan were outstanding, of which options to purchase 2,549,422 shares were exercisable, and no options were outstanding or exercisable under our 2011 Incentive Plan. We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the closing of this offering to register shares that may be issued pursuant to our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2011 Incentive Plan. The registration statement is expected to become effective immediately upon filing, and shares covered by the registration statement will then become eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to the Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates, vesting restrictions and any applicable lock-up agreements. For a more complete discussion of our equity incentive plans, see Executive Compensation  Employee Benefit and Stock Plans.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to non-U.S. holders (as defined below) of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relating thereto. This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, which could result in U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences different than those summarized below. We have not sought a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.

This summary does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any state, local non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction and is limited to investors who will hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset for tax purposes. This summary does not address all tax considerations that may be important to a particular investor in light of the investors circumstances or to certain categories of non-U.S. investors that may be subject to special rules, such as:

In addition, if a partnership (including any entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our Class A common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and on the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships that hold our Class A common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors.

The following discussion of material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to non-U.S. holders is for general information only. You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

For purposes of this discussion, you are a non-U.S. holder if you are any holder other than (i) a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, (ii) a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that was created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust that either is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and has one or more U.S. persons with authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.

If we make distributions on our Class A common stock, these distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent these distributions exceed both our current and our accumulated earnings and profits, they will constitute a return of capital and will first reduce your basis in our Class A common stock, but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the sale of stock.

Any dividend paid to you generally will be subject to withholding either at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividend or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. In order to receive a reduced treaty rate, you must provide us with an IRS Form W-8BEN or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8 properly certifying qualification for the reduced rate. If you are eligible for a reduced rate of withholding pursuant to an income tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. If you hold our Class A common stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on your behalf, you will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries.

Dividends received by you that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, such dividend is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States) are exempt from withholding. In order to claim this exemption, you must provide us with an IRS Form W-8ECI or other applicable IRS Form W-8 properly certifying exemption. Effectively connected dividends, although not subject to withholding, are taxed at the same graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S. persons, net of certain deductions and credits, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. In addition, if you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, dividends you receive that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.

Special certification and other requirements apply to certain non-U.S. holders that are entities rather than individuals.

Subject to the discussion below regarding recent legislative withholding developments, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock unless:

If you are described in the first bullet above, you will be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale at the same graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S. persons (net of certain deductions and credits), and if you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, you may be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. If you are described in the second bullet above, you will be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which tax may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though you are not considered a resident of the United States).

We believe that we are not currently and will not become a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of our other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. Even if we become a USRPHC, however, as long as our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, our Class A common stock will be treated as a U.S. real property interest only if you actually or constructively hold more than 5% of such regularly traded Class A common stock at any time during the applicable period specified in the Internal Revenue Code.

Our Class A common stock beneficially owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of death will be includable in the decedents gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and therefore may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax.

Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to you, your name and address, and the amount of tax withheld, if any, regardless of whether withholding is reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. A similar report is sent to you. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in your country of residence.

Payments of dividends on or the gross proceeds of disposition of our Class A common stock may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding at a current rate of 28% unless you establish an exemption, for example by properly certifying your non-U.S. status on a Form W-8BEN or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that you are a U.S. person.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to you under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided that the required information or returns are furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

Recent legislation generally imposes withholding at a rate of 30% on payments to certain foreign entities (including financial institutions, which include hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and other investment vehicles regardless of size), after December 31, 2012, of dividends on and the gross proceeds of dispositions of U.S. common stock, unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (that are different from, and in addition to, the beneficial owner certification requirements described above) have been satisfied that generally relate to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the possible implications of this legislation on your investment in our Class A common stock.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as sole book-running manager of this offering and as representative of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, each underwriter named below has severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that underwriter, the number of shares set forth opposite the underwriters name.

The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares included in this offering are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to purchase all the shares (other than those covered by the over-allotment option described below) if they purchase any of the shares.

Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the initial public offering price not to exceed $             per share. If all the shares are not sold at the initial offering price, the underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The representative has advised us that the underwriters do not intend to make sales to discretionary accounts.

If the underwriters sell more shares than the total number set forth in the table above, we have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 519,300 additional shares at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters may exercise the option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in connection with this offering. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter must purchase a number of additional shares approximately proportionate to that underwriters initial purchase commitment. Any shares issued or sold under the option will be issued and sold on the same terms and conditions as the other shares that are the subject of this offering.

We, our officers and directors and substantially all of our shareholders have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Citi, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock. Citi in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.

If, however, at any time beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, (i) we have filed with the SEC at least one quarterly report on Form 10-Q, (ii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market is at least 33% greater than the initial public offering price per share set forth on the cover page of this prospectus for 20 trading days out of any 30 trading day period ending after the 90th day following the date of this prospectus (which 30 trading day period may begin prior to such 90th day), and (iii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on the last day of that 30 trading day period described in clause (ii) is at least 25% greater than the initial public offering price, then 25% of each holders capital stock that is subject to the 180-day restrictions described above as of immediately prior to the opening of The Nasdaq Global Market on the day following the end of the 30 trading day period, or the initial release date, will be automatically released from those restrictions on the initial release date provided that none of the underwriters have published

research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date. If an underwriter has published research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date, the initial release date will be deferred until the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on, and including, the date such research is published. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to our company occurs during the last 17-day period of the 180-day restricted period or the last 17-day period prior to the initial release date, or (ii) prior to the initial release date or the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the initial release date or the last day of the 180-day restricted period, then, in either case, the initial release date will be deferred or the 180-day restricted period will be extended, as applicable, and the restrictions of the lock-up agreements will continue to apply, until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on, and including, the issuance of the earnings release or material news or the occurrence of the material event, unless Citi waives, in writing, such extension or deferral.

At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the shares for sale at the initial public offering price to persons who are directors, officers or employees, or who are otherwise associated with us through a directed share program. The number of shares available for sale to the general public will be reduced by the number of directed shares purchased by participants in the program. Each person buying shares through the directed share program has agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, he or she will not, without the prior written consent of Citi, dispose of or hedge any shares purchased in the program. Citi in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. Any directed shares not purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same basis as all other shares offered. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the Securities Act, in connection with the sales of the directed shares.

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our shares. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representative. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our results of operations, our current financial condition, our future prospects, our markets, the economic conditions in and future prospects for the industry in which we compete, our management, and currently prevailing general conditions in the equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the shares will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our shares will develop and continue after this offering.

We have applied to have our Class A common stock approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol Z.

The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option.

We estimate that the total expenses of this offering will be approximately $3.4 million. The underwriters have agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with this offering.

In connection with this offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions, which may include purchases pursuant to the over-allotment option, and stabilizing purchases.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the shares. They may also cause the price of the shares to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on The Nasdaq Global Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the underwriters commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.

We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Zillow, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Zillow, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zillow, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

the date is July 14, 2011

Zillow, Inc. (the Company, we, us and our) was incorporated as a Washington corporation effective December 13, 2004. We operate a real estate information marketplace dedicated to providing vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages and enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals.

We operate in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of factors. For example, we believe that changes in any of the following areas could have a significant negative effect on us in terms of our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows: rates of revenue growth; engagement and usage of our products; scaling and adaptation of existing technology and network infrastructure; competition in our market; management of our growth; acquisitions and investments; qualified employees and key personnel; protection of our brand and intellectual property; changes in government regulation affecting our business; intellectual property infringement and other claims; protection of customers information and privacy concerns; and security measures related to our website, among other things.

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates are used for revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, website development costs, recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets and for share-based compensation. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application.

The accompanying balance sheet as of March 31, 2011, the statements of operations and the statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 and the statement of shareholders equity for the three months ended March 31, 2011 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our financial position as of March 31, 2011 and results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to financial statements related to the three month periods are unaudited. The results of the three months ended March 31, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2011 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.

Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders

Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement, (1) all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, assuming we raise at least $40.0 million and (2) all of the outstanding shares of Class C common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock. The March 31, 2011 unaudited pro forma balance sheet data has been prepared assuming the conversion of the convertible preferred stock outstanding into 9,276,190 shares of Class A common stock and the conversion of the Class C common stock into 2,305,980 shares of Class A common stock. Unaudited pro forma net loss per share attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the three months ended March 31, 2011 has been computed to give effect to the automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock and Class C common stock (using the if-converted method) into Class A common stock as though the conversion had occurred on the original dates of issuance.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We place cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, in order to limit exposure of our investments.

Our credit risk on accounts receivable is mitigated by the relatively short payment terms that we offer. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts such that receivables are stated at their net realizable value.

Deferred offering costs of $1.0 million are included in other assets in the balance sheet as of March 31, 2011. Upon the consummation of the initial public offering, these amounts will be offset against the proceeds of the offering and included in shareholders equity. If the offering is terminated, the deferred offering costs will be expensed. There were no amounts capitalized as of December 31, 2010.

We consider all highly liquid securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds as well as certificates of deposit with financial institutions. We regularly maintain cash in excess of federally insured limits at financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, our investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities with original maturities when purchased greater than three months but less than 12 months. The U.S. Treasury securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are recorded at amortized cost, as we do not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to maturity. The amortized cost of the U.S. Treasury securities approximates fair value.

Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual terms past due. We review accounts receivable on a regular basis and estimate an amount of losses for uncollectible accounts based on our historical

collections experience, age of the receivable, knowledge of the customer and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole. We record changes in our estimate to the allowance for doubtful accounts through bad debt expense and relieve the allowance when accounts are ultimately determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses.

The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods presented (in thousands):

Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:

Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements, which extend the useful life of the related asset, are capitalized. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, we record a gain or loss based on the differences between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed asset.

The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Amortization expense is included in technology and development expense.

Capitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at one year. The estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality.

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition. We assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.

We assess goodwill for possible impairment using a two-step process. The first step identifies if there is potential goodwill impairment. If step one indicates that an impairment may exist, a second step is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in our statements of operations.

We purchase and license data content from multiple data providers. This data content consists of U.S. county data about home details (e.g., the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) and other information relating to the purchase price of homes both current and historical, as well as imagery, mapping and parcel data that is displayed on our website. Our home details data not only provides information about a home and its related transactions which is displayed on our website, but is also used in our proprietary valuation algorithms to produce Zestimates, Rent Zestimates and Zillow Home Value Indexes. License agreement terms vary by vendor. In some instances, we retain perpetual rights to this information after the contract ends; in other instances, the information and data are licensed only during the fixed term of the agreement. Additionally, certain data license agreements provide for uneven payment amounts throughout the life of the contract term.

We capitalize payments made to third parties for data licenses that we expect to provide future economic benefit through the recovery of the costs of these arrangements via the generation of our revenues and margins. For data license contracts that include uneven payment amounts, we capitalize the payments as they are made as an intangible asset and amortize the total contract value over the estimated useful life. For contracts in which we have perpetual rights to the data, the total contract value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract plus two years, which is equivalent to the estimated useful life of the asset. For contracts in which we do not have access to the data beyond the contractual term, the total contract value is amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. We evaluate data content contracts for potential capitalization at the inception of the arrangement as well as each time periodic payments to third parties are made.

The amortization period for the capitalized purchased content is based on our best estimate of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from five to 7.5 years. The determination of the useful life includes consideration of a variety of factors including, but not limited to, our assessment of the expected use of the asset and contractual provisions that may limit the useful life, as well as an assessment of when the data is expected to become obsolete based on our estimates of the diminishing value of the data over time. We evaluate the useful life of the capitalized purchased data content each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If we determine the estimate of the assets useful life requires modification, the carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life. The capitalized purchased data content is amortized on a straight-line basis as the pattern of delivery of the economic benefits of the data cannot reliably be determined because we do not have the ability to reliably predict future traffic to our website and mobile applications.

Under certain other data agreements, the underlying data is obtained on a subscription basis with consistent monthly recurring payment terms over the contractual period. Upon the expiration of such arrangements, we no longer have the right to access the related data, and therefore, the costs incurred under such contracts are not capitalized and are expensed as payments are made. We would immediately lose rights to data under these arrangements if we were to cancel the subscription and/or cease making payments under the subscription arrangements.

We also have intangible assets for developed technology, customer relationships and trademarks which we recorded in connection with our March 2011 acquisition of the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company. These intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset.

Recoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such review at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.

Deferred revenue consists of prepaid but unrecognized subscription revenue, advertising fees received or billed in advance of the delivery or completion of the services and for amounts received in instances when revenue recognition criteria have not been met. Deferred revenue is recognized when the services are provided and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

For our operating leases, we recognize rent expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases and, accordingly, we record the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expenses as a deferred rent liability. We have landlord-funded leasehold improvements that are recorded as deferred rent liabilities, which are being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the noncancelable terms of the operating leases.

Our revenue is primarily derived from advertising services. In general, we recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.

Marketplace Revenues.    Marketplace revenues consist of individual subscriptions sold to real estate agents under our Premier Agent program, and cost per click, or CPC, advertising related to our Zillow Mortgage Marketplace sold to mortgage lenders.

Subscription advertising revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the advertising is delivered. Typical terms of our Premier Agent subscription contracts range from six to 12 months.

In Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, we present mortgage lenders quotes to consumers who request rates for mortgage loans. We recognize revenue when a user clicks on a mortgage advertisement or on a link to obtain additional information about a mortgage loan quote.

Display Revenues.    Display revenues primarily consist of graphical advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis to advertisers. We recognize these revenues as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our website or mobile applications.

In 2009, one customer accounted for approximately 17% of our total revenues. There was no other single customer that generated 10% or more of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 or 2010 or during the three months ended March 31, 2010 or 2011.

Our cost of revenues consists of expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including associated headcount expenses, such as salaries and benefits and share-based compensation and bonuses. Cost of revenues also includes credit card fees, ad serving costs paid to third parties, revenue sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships and facilities costs allocated on a headcount basis.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, expenses attributable to research and development for our business totaled $10.1 million, $7.7 million and $7.8 million, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, expenses attributable to research and development for our business totaled $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Research and development costs are recorded in technology and development expenses.

We have one reportable segment. Our reportable segment has been identified based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

We measure compensation expenses for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expenses over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair-value for our awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting periods.

In valuing our options, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives, including estimated forfeiture rates, of the options. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option grant date. Expected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date. There is no active external or internal market for our common shares. Thus, it is not possible to estimate the expected volatility of our share price in estimating the fair value of the options granted. Accordingly, as a substitute for such volatility, we use the published historical volatilities of industry peers in the online publishing market (primarily the financial and real estate services industries) representing the verticals in which we operate. We estimate the weighted-average expected life of the options as the average of the vesting option schedule and the term of the award, since we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time share-based awards have been exercisable. The term of the award is estimated using the simplified method, as awards are plain vanilla share options. Forfeiture rates are estimated using historical actual forfeiture trends as well as our judgment of future forfeitures. These rates are evaluated at least annually and any change in compensation expense is recognized in the period of the change. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the types of awards and employee class. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from managements current estimates.

We use the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.

We adopted the provisions related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of January 1, 2007, which provide a financial statement recognition and measurement threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We sponsor a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participation in the plan is available to all employees with a minimum of three months of service, and each participant may elect to contribute a portion of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits.

At our discretion we may contribute to the employees account an amount up to 25% of the first 6% of employee contributions. During October 2008, we suspended our matching contributions, and our board of

directors amended the 401(k) plan in December 2009 to terminate the matching program, resulting in no contributions or expense in 2009 or 2010. The amount contributed and expensed for the match was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition to require companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an elements estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011 with earlier application permitted. We adopted this guidance prospectively starting on January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not and is not expected to have any impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures based on the types of revenue arrangements we have historically entered into and currently have in place.

Effective October 31, 2009, we adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This standard establishes only two levels of GAAP, authoritative and non-authoritative. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, became the source of authoritative, non-governmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. As the Codification was not intended to change or alter existing GAAP, it did not have any impact on our financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements, amends disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. Accordingly, we adopted this new guidance beginning January 1, 2010, except for the additional Level 3 requirements, which we adopted beginning January 1, 2011. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those whose fair value inputs are unobservable and reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The adoption of this guidance did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standards also establish a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2  Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.

Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.

Cash equivalents  Cash equivalents include money market funds and investments with original maturities of three months or less. The fair value measurement of these assets is based on quoted market prices in active markets and, therefore, these assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Short-term investments  Short-term investments consist mainly of U.S. government agency securities and certificates of deposit. The fair value measurement of these assets is based on observable market-based inputs or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and, therefore, is recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The balance of short-term investments was $11.7 million at December 31, 2009, consisting entirely of certificates of deposit that were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The balance of short-term investments was $1.5 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively, consisting entirely of U.S. Treasury securities which were classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

The following tables present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates presented (in thousands):

We did not have any Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 or 2010 or as of March 31, 2011.

The following table presents the detail of accounts receivable as of the dates presented (in thousands):

The following table presents the detail of property and equipment as of the dates presented (in thousands):

We recorded amortization and depreciation expenses related to property and equipment other than website development costs of $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011.

We capitalized $4.2 million, $3.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in website development costs during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011. Amortization expense for website development costs included in technology and development expenses totaled $4.7 million, $4.2 million and $3.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011. Capitalized website development costs written down to the net realizable value during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, were $0.3 million, $39 thousand and $0.2 million, respectively, and are included in technology and development expenses.

Construction-in-progress primarily consists of website development costs that are capitalizable, but for which the associated applications had not been placed in service.

On March 3, 2011, we acquired all of the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company. We intend to offer the service as part of our platform of free and paid services for real estate professionals as an additional tool for marketing their listings across the web.

The purchase price paid was $1.0 million in cash and 207,100 shares of Class A common stock. Acquisition-related expenses were expensed as incurred and were negligible. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more information becomes available, but in any case, will not be revised beyond twelve months after the acquisition date.

Identifiable assets acquired in the business combination have been measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the business combination (in thousands):

Intangibles assets acquired consisted of the following (in thousands):

We used a cost approach to measure the fair value of the developed technology and the trademarks. The valuation of the developed technology was based on the estimated cost to recreate the technology and the

trademarks were valued based on the relief-from-royalty method. We used an income approach to measure the fair value of the trademarks based on the discounted cash flow method, whereby the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of cash flows that the applicable asset is expected to generate. The fair value of the Class A common stock issued as consideration in the asset acquisition was derived based on third-party valuation of our Class A common stock. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements under the fair value hierarchy.

The results of operations related to the asset acquisition have been included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial information for the acquisition accounted for as a business combination has not been presented, as the effects were not material to our financial statements.

During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we recorded goodwill of $1.1 million in conjunction with our acquisition of the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company. All the goodwill recorded as of March 31, 2011 is deductible for tax purposes.

The following table presents the detail of intangible assets subject to amortization as of the dates presented (in thousands):

Amortization expense recorded for purchased content for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and these amounts are included in technology and development expenses. The remaining weighted-average amortization period as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, was approximately 2.7 years and 1.8 years, respectively.

Amortization expense recorded for intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

Estimated future amortization expense for purchased content, including $2.9 million of amortization related to future commitments, as of December 31, 2010 is as follows (in thousands):

We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2011, we did not have taxable income and, therefore, no tax liability or expense has been recorded in the financial statements.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate for the periods presented:

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts for tax purposes. The following table presents the significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the dates presented (in thousands):

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. We have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 because there is a significant degree of uncertainty around our ability to realize the deferred tax assets in the future. The valuation allowance increased by $3.8 million and $2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

We have accumulated tax losses of approximately $59.0 million and $64.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income. Approximately $1.2 million of our net operating loss carryforwards relate to tax deductible share-based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. To the extent that net operating loss carryforwards, if realized, relate to share-based compensation, the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to shareholders equity, rather than to the statement of operations. Additionally, we have research and development credit carryforwards of $0.8 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, which are available to reduce future tax liabilities. The tax loss and research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. The use of these net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits may be limited should an ownership change occur in future years under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.

As a result of the adoption of the new guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of January 1, 2007, we reduced our deferred tax asset related to research and development credits by $0.4 million which was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. However, due to the presence of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset, there was no impact to accumulated deficit upon adoption.

We are currently not under audit in any tax jurisdiction. Tax years from 2007 through 2010 are currently open for audit by federal and state taxing authorities, while 2005 and 2006 are subject to adjustment to the extent the net operating loss from those years are utilized on a future years tax return.

At December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $0.9 million is recorded as a reduction to the deferred tax asset. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense and are zero.

Changes for unrecognized tax benefits during 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):

In November 2005, we completed a private placement of $26.0 million, authorizing the issuance and sale of 17,931,034 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock (Series A) at $1.45 per share. In July 2006, we completed a private placement of $25.0 million, authorizing the issuance and sale of 6,933,103 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock (Series B) at $3.6059 per share. In October 2007, we completed a private placement of $30.0 million, authorizing the issuance and sale of 6,489,660 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (Series C) at $4.62274 per share. The key terms of all issued preferred stock are summarized below:

The holders of Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock have preferential rights to dividends at the rate of $0.116, $0.28847 and $0.3698 per share per annum, respectively, when and if declared by our board of directors, over common shareholders. The right to receive dividends is not cumulative. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010 and as of March 31, 2011, no dividends had been declared.

At any time after the date of issuance, each share of Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock, at the option of the holder, shall be converted into Class A common stock using the formula provided in our articles of incorporation (after giving effect to the reverse stock split described in Note 15, the conversion ratio is 3.38-to-1), or automatically upon the effectiveness of a registration statement filed for a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering of our Class A common stock with an aggregate offering price to the public of more than $40.0 million, or with the approval of the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, respectively.

In the event of a deemed liquidation, as defined, the holders of Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock have preferential rights over common shareholders to liquidation payments of $1.45, $3.6059, and $4.62274 per share, respectively, plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares, if any. Upon completion of such a distribution, the remaining assets shall be distributed among the holders of all classes of common stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Class A common stock held by each (assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B and Class C common stock into shares of Class A common stock in the ratios provided). Series A, B and C convertible preferred shareholders do not have preferential rights over other preferred series holders and should there be insufficient funds to pay such preferences in full, then each preferred series holder will have liquidation rights that are proportionate to other preferred series holders.

We have classified the Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock within shareholders equity since the convertible preferred stock is not redeemable, and the Series A, B and C convertible preferred stockholders do not have the right to effect a deemed liquidation of the Company.

Holders of Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock into which their preferred stock could be converted. As long as at least 20% of the Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding on the original issue date remains outstanding, the holders of Series A convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two of the seven members of our board of directors. The holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Series B convertible preferred stock, and Series C convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single voting group, are entitled to elect four members of our board of directors, and the holders of all classes of common stock and all series of convertible preferred stock, voting together, shall be entitled to elect any remaining members.

Our Class A common stock has no preferences or privileges and is not redeemable. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share.

Class B common stock has no preferences or privileges and is not redeemable. At any time after the date of issuance, each share of Class B common stock, at the option of the holder, shall be converted into one share of Class A common stock or Class C common stock, or automatically converted upon the affirmative vote by or written consent of holders of a majority of the shares of the Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share.

Class C common stock has no preferences or privileges and is not redeemable as of December 31, 2010 or March 31, 2011. Each share of Class C common stock, at the option of the holder thereof, shall be convertible into one share of Class A common stock, at any time after the consummation of the first firm commitment underwritten public offering of our securities. Each share of Class C common stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon the sale of the Company or upon the affirmative vote by holders of at least 65% of the shares of the Class C common stock. Holders of Class C common stock have no voting rights, except to the extent required by law.

The following shares of Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance as of the dates presented:

In February 2005, our board of directors adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan). Under the terms of the Plan, our board of directors may grant stock awards, including incentive and nonqualified stock options, to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors, and independent contractors. Upon adoption of the 2005 Plan, an aggregate of 2,485,207 shares of Class A common stock was reserved for future issuance. Through December 31, 2010, our board of directors has subsequently approved increases to the shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance to 6,730,769 shares.

We grant nonqualified stock options with exercise prices, determined by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors, that are generally equal to the fair value of the Class A common stock on the date of grant. All stock options granted since inception have been nonqualified stock options. Options granted under the 2005 Plan are exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by our board of directors, but the term of the options and the right of exercise may not exceed seven years from the date of grant. Employees forfeit their rights to exercise vested options after 90 days or 12 months following the termination of their employment, depending on the cause of termination. Options have a seven-year term and generally vest 25% after 12 months, and the remaining 75% of the award vests ratably over the next 36 months.

A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2011 is as follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $42 thousand, $32 thousand and $0.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $1.7 million.

The fair value of options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, assuming no dividends and with the following assumptions:

The fair value of shares vested at December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $0.6 million, $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The fair value of shares vested at March 31, 2011 was $1.0 million.

Since July 2006, we have obtained valuation analyses prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm to assist us in determining the fair value of our Class A common stock. The valuations used methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the AICPA Practice Guide. In obtaining third-party valuations of our Class A common stock, our management provided the third-party valuation firm with projections for revenue and expenses on a cash basis, and information about our prospects, our performance and economic and financial market conditions, which the valuation firm used, along with other information, to perform its valuation analysis. These valuations were reviewed by management and either the board of directors or the compensation committee of the board of directors in conjunction with share-based compensation grants. In determining the fair value of our Class A common stock, the board of directors and the compensation committee of our board of directors considered these valuation reports, and other qualitative and quantitative factors that they considered relevant, including but not limited to: (i) key employee hirings and terminations; (ii) the seasonality of our business; (iii) general market conditions in the technology, media and real estate markets; (iv) our operating performance and competitive position within the online real estate space; (v) revenue and income projections; (vi) our cash burn rate; (vii) the market value of stock of our peer companies; (viii) present value of possible future cash flows; and (ix) the likelihood of various liquidity scenarios. These determinations of fair value were used for purposes of determining the Black-Scholes-Merton fair value of our stock option awards and related share-based compensation expense.

The following table presents the effects of share-based compensation on our statements of operations during the periods presented (in thousands):

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding and vested stock options as of December 31, 2010:

As of December 31, 2010, there was a total of $3.2 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.76 years. As of March 31, 2011, there was a total of $4.6 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 3.09 years.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares (including Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock) outstanding during the period. Series A, B and C convertible preferred shareholders do not have contractual obligations to share in or fund the losses of the Company. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares (including Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock) outstanding during the period and potentially dilutive Class A common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the Class A common stock equivalent would be antidilutive. Potential Class A common stock equivalents consist of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, 3,372,946, 4,394,807 and 5,010,310 shares underlying stock options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders because their effect would have been antidilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, 5,194,454 and 5,477,032 shares underlying stock options have been excluded from the calculations of diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders because their effect would have been antidilutive.

In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of the Company, the holders of all classes of common stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of the Company after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been satisfied. We have not presented net loss per share attributable to common shareholders under the two-class method for our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock because it would be the same for each class due to equal dividend and liquidation rights for each class.

Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share were computed to give effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted method) into common stock as though the conversion had occurred on the dates of issuance.

The following table presents the calculation of pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders (in thousands):

We have various operating leases for office space and equipment. Our current headquarters is under an operating lease expiring in February 2013 that includes an option to extend the lease term for an additional five-year period. Future minimum payments for all operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, was $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Rent expense for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 was $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.

During 2009 and 2010, $0.2 million and $0.3 million respectively, was amortized from the deferred rent liability as a reduction of rent expense.

As of December 31, 2010, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for content related to our website totaling $2.9 million. The amount due for this content is as follows (in thousands):

Separately, we entered into two significant arrangements in 2005 and 2007, respectively, to purchase licensed data for the purposes of populating our website. These data costs are being accounted for in a manner consistent with a subscription service, with license fees charged to expense as payments are made. We are obligated to make payments under a five year commitment totaling $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the amount is due as follows (in thousands):

We have three outstanding letters of credit totaling $0.7 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, payable to the landlord of our headquarters office in the event we default on our lease. The letters of credit are secured by our investments and are effective until 60 days after the expiration date of the lease.

In October 2009, Mortgage Grader LLC filed a complaint against us for patent infringement in the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleged, among other things, that our website technology infringes one patent owned by Mortgage Grader, and sought injunctive relief, monetary damages, costs and attorneys fees. We denied Mortgage Graders allegations and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that we were not infringing the Mortgage Grader patent, and that the Mortgage Grader patent was unenforceable and invalid. In April 2010, Zillow and Mortgage Grader signed a patent license and settlement agreement for an insubstantial payment.

In May 2010, Source Search Technologies, LLC (SST) filed an action alleging that we infringed certain patent rights. In March 2011, we signed a settlement agreement with SST, and Zillow paid a small one-time license fee. As a result of the settlement, effective from January 1, 2010 for as long as the related patent is valid and enforceable in the U.S., we must pay to SST insubstantial royalties on a quarterly basis under the terms of the agreement.

In March 2010, Smarter Agent, LLC filed a complaint against us for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint seeks, among other things, a judgment that we may have infringed certain patents held by Smarter Agent, an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. In November 2010, the U.S. Patent Office granted our petition for re-examination of the three patents-in-suit, and in an initial office action rejected all claims. In March 2011, the court granted a stay of the litigation pending the completion of the re-examination proceedings. We were granted a stay against the patent infringement complaint. We have not recorded an accrual related to this complaint as of December 31, 2010 or March 31, 2011 as we do not believe a material loss is probable. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable.

In April 2010, First American CoreLogic filed a complaint against us, for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint seeks, among other things, a judgment that we may have infringed certain patents held by CoreLogic, an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. We have not recorded an accrual related to this complaint as of December 31, 2010 or March 31, 2011 as we do not believe a material loss is probable. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable.

In September 2010, LendingTree, LLC filed a complaint against us, for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The complaint seeks, among other things, a judgment that we may have infringed certain patents held by LendingTree, an injunctive order against the alleged infringing activities and an award for damages. We have not recorded an accrual related to this complaint as of December 31, 2010 or March 31, 2011 as we do not believe a material loss is probable. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable.

In addition to the aforementioned, from time to time, we are involved in litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation and claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, we have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and executive officers that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations may vary.

We have one reportable segment. Our reportable segment has been identified based on how our chief operating decision-maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

The chief executive officer acts as the chief operating decision-maker and reviews financial and operational information on an entity-wide basis. We have one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or plans for levels or components. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.

The chief executive officer reviews information about revenue categories for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The following table presents our revenue categories during the periods presented (in thousands):

In February 2011, we received a tax credit of $0.3 million, from the State of Washington, net of fees paid to tax advisors, relating to a refund of certain taxes from 2006 to 2009.

In March 2011, we acquired the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company.

In March 2011, we signed a lease agreement effective through November 2022 for new corporate office space in Seattle, which will become our new corporate headquarters. We continue to utilize our existing space and we are in the process of evaluating sublease opportunities for the current office space in Seattle. The following table is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under the new corporate office space in Seattle (in thousands):

In March 2011, we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to establish a line of credit of $4.0 million, secured by substantially all our assets other than our intellectual property, to be used for general business purposes. The line of credit contains financial and non-financial covenants. As of March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants. The line of credit is available through March 2013. In March 2011, we executed a standby letter of credit of $1.5 million in connection with the lease of our new Seattle offices and reserved this amount against the line of credit, which reduces the available line to $2.5 million.

In March 2011, the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance to 23,350,000 before giving effect to the 3.38-to-1 reverse stock split of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock that was effected on June 17, 2011.

In April 2011, our board of directors approved the filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of our Class A common stock.

In April 2011, our board of directors approved the reclassification of our common stock into Class A common stock in connection with the completion of our initial public offering of our Class A common stock.

In April 2011, the Class C common stock shareholders consented to the automatic conversion of each share of Class C common stock into one share of Class A common stock upon the effectiveness of the registration statement.

On June 16, 2011, our board of directors and shareholders approved a 3.38-to-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock that was effected on June 17, 2011. Fractional shares will be settled in cash for common shareholders. All references to shares in the financial statements and the notes to financial statements, including but not limited to the number of shares and per share amounts, unless otherwise noted, have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split retroactively.

On June 16, 2011 our board of directors and shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which amendment fixes the authorized capital stock as follows: 600,000,000 shares of Class A common stock; 15,000,000 shares of Class B common stock; and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

In June 2011, the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan was adjusted to give effect to the 3.38-to-1 reverse stock split of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock that was effected on June 17, 2011.

We have evaluated subsequent events through July 14, 2011, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

Until                     , 2011 (25 days after the date of this prospectus), all dealers that buy, sell or trade shares of our Class A common stock, whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

The following table shows expenses to be incurred in connection with the offering described in this registration statement, all of which will be paid by Zillow. All amounts are estimates, other than the SEC registration fee and the FINRA filing fee.

The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated, under certain circumstances, to indemnify our directors, officers and controlling persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Reference is made to the form of underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto. For information about indemnification of our officers and directors, see Executive Compensation  Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters.

Reference is also made to Item 17 for our undertakings with respect to indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act.

Since January 1, 2008, we made sales of the following unregistered securities:

(a) Since January 1, 2008, we have granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,933,880 shares of our Class A common stock at exercise prices ranging from $3.25 to $8.96 per share to officers, employees, directors and consultants under our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Since January 1, 2008, we have issued to our officers, employees, directors and consultants an aggregate of 1,166,854 shares of our Class A common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.09 to $8.96 pursuant to exercises of options granted under our 2005 Stock Plan, as amended. These transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in reliance upon Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

(b) On March 3, 2011, we issued 207,100 shares of our Class A common stock to an accredited investor in connection with our acquisition of the operating assets of a real estate agent and rental property manager marketing service company.

These transactions were exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, or Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or pursuant to benefit plans and

contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about Zillow.

(b)    The following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Registration Statement:

All financial statement schedules have been omitted because they are not required, not applicable or the information to be included in the financial statement schedules is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.

A.    Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.

(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(3) The registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this Amendment No. 6 to Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Seattle, State of Washington, on July 15, 2011.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this Amendment No. 6 to Registration Statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.

377 2011-07-15 It can seem difficult to square Mr. Hinton’s 12-year run at News International — a company whose papers ran pictures of nude women and paid sources for information — with his leadership of Dow Jones and The Journal, a paper that until recently preferred sketches over photographs.

It is his tenure at News International that is now being re-examined. In statements to Parliament after the hacking came to light in 2006, Mr. Hinton said that it was limited to one rogue reporter. Mr. Hinton also said that he was never presented with any evidence that led him to believe the practice was widespread. No one has linked Mr. Hinton, 67, to the eavesdropping. But as evidence grows showing that intercepting private voice mail messages was common practice at Murdoch publications in Britain, his remarks would indicate at best that he unwittingly allowed a corrupt journalistic culture to flourish underneath him.

“One explanation is connivance and alleged criminality,” said Claire Enders, a media analyst in Britain who has examined the potential fallout that the scandal could have on Mr. Murdoch’s businesses. “Another is a complete absence of engagement with the business — neither of which is expected of a senior officer of a major company.”

One of the editors Mr. Hinton hired for The News of the World, Neil Wallis, was arrested Thursday in connection with the hacking scandal. The two served together as members of Britain’s Press Complaints Commission, with Mr. Hinton as chairman of the committee that sets journalistic standards. In an episode that gained notoriety across Britain, Mr. Wallis published nude shots of a radio personality in 2001 when he was editor of The People. The blunder cost the tabloid a settlement of £250,000, about $400,000, and produced a landmark privacy ruling.

Politicians and the public were outraged, particularly because Mr. Wallis sat on the commission responsible for policing journalistic integrity. According to news media accounts at the time, Mr. Hinton told him in colorfully explicit terms that he was an “idiot” for buying the pictures. A little more than a year later, Mr. Wallis was hired as The News of the World’s deputy editor. Mr. Hinton and a Dow Jones spokeswoman declined to comment.

Few people who work for Mr. Murdoch are closer to him than Mr. Hinton. At age 15, he joined the first paper that Mr. Murdoch ever owned, The News of Adelaide, a tabloid in South Australia. Two years ago, Mr. Murdoch threw a party for Mr. Hinton celebrating his 50th year with News Corporation. Delivering the toasts were Mr. Murdoch; The New York Post’s editor, Col Allan; and Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor at the center of the hacking fiasco.

Mr. Hinton, a skilled dancer, is known for being the center of attention at Christmas parties, and he has proved popular among his employees at The Wall Street Journal. They use the phrase “Les is more” to express their affection (although Mr. Hinton is always quick to correct the Americans who pronounce his name “less,” telling them it is pronounced “lez”). As Mr. Murdoch built a news media empire from London to Los Angeles, Mr. Hinton followed, running News Corporation businesses on two continents. He got his start in the United States as a reporter, then crossed to the business operations.

In 1991, Mr. Murdoch appointed him to run News America Publishing, the umbrella company for the News Corporation’s papers in the United States. In 1993 he was named head of Fox Television Stations, where he oversaw all of the local channels.

At the time, tensions between the News Corporation’s East and West Coast staffs ran high, and Mr. Hinton was seen by his Hollywood colleagues as part of a foreign Murdoch print-oriented culture. Many of them were none too pleased that the papers Mr. Hinton used to run relished writing about the private lives of movie stars.

Mr. Murdoch moved Mr. Hinton to London in 1995, putting him in charge of News International, with its stable of papers that were staid, like The Times of London, and salacious, like The Sun and The News of the World.

During the eight years that Mr. Hinton was chairman of the body that wrote the journalist’s code of conduct, known as the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee, part of his responsibility was to testify before Parliament or rush to the defense of his colleagues whenever outrage over the press’s aggressive and legally questionable tactics was pitched enough to warrant an inquiry.

He resisted even the most minor efforts to regulate practices that many media critics saw as unseemly. After a scandal at The Mirror in which writers were making stock-purchase recommendations for companies from which they expected to profit, Parliament wanted to require journalists to declare their interests in any shares they recommended. Mr. Hinton attacked the proposal as “completely unworkable.”

While British papers may operate with less rigid principles than American papers (Dow Jones, for example, has long prohibited journalists from owning shares in companies that they cover), they do carefully watch themselves in one area: libel.

“You need to know the evidence,” said Niri Shan, the head of media law at Taylor Wessing, a London law firm. “And I think that’s why some people find it hard to believe that the editor or other people in the organization didn’t know the provenance of the information. If I’m lawyering a piece, the first question I’m going to ask is ‘How did you get this?’ ”
378 2011-07-15 The stenciled markings showed each crate had contained a pair of lightweight missiles called SA-7s — early Soviet versions of the same class of weapon as the better known American-made Stingers, which were used by Afghan fighters against the Soviets in Afghanistan. It was not clear who had taken them. The rebel guards variously blamed Qaddafi forces and misinformed opposition fighters.

During more than four decades in power, Colonel Qaddafi’s often bellicose government is thought to have acquired as many as 20,000 of these missiles, known as Manpads, for Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems, in arms deals with the former Eastern bloc.

Many are assumed to remain in the Qaddafi military’s custody, American officials say, and others have been fired in the conflict, meaning that the number loose is most likely much smaller than the original stock.

There has been no publicly available evidence that Libya’s rebels are directly involved in missile trafficking. Rebel leaders say that if their fighters have taken any missiles, they meant to use them in battle, and that they say they suspect soldiers in the Qaddafi military of selling and smuggling these kinds of arms.

But American officials and Western security analysts say there are grave worries that once the weapons inherited by rebels have been made accessible and reach unsupervised hands, opportunistic smugglers can match them to potential buyers.

In a telephone interview, Andrew J. Shapiro, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, described the unsecured missiles in Libya as “one of the things that keep me up at night.”

Two other American officials, speaking anonymously so as not to upset diplomatic relations with the rebels, said that after the initial leakage of the SA-7s the American government repeatedly asked the National Transitional Council, the de facto rebel authority, to collect and secure the missiles and to prevent more missiles from getting loose.

When the depot here at Ga’a fell, however, those requests appeared to have had little effect. “The rebels came from all over the western mountains, and they just took what they wanted,” said Riyad, a supervisor of the ruined arsenal’s small contingent of rebel guards.

The United States is giving $1.5 million to two international organizations — the Mines Advisory Group from Britain and the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action — that it hopes can help secure the stockpiles and prevent more missiles from slipping out.

Last month, Washington also sent an interagency team to four nations near or bordering Libya — Algeria, Chad, Mali and Niger — to talk with those countries about border security and identifying the missiles should they cross, Mr. Shapiro said. Visits to other countries are planned.

The president of Chad and officials in Algeria have been quoted since the war began as saying that Manpads diverted from Libya have traveled over their borders to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in North Africa. Neither Chad nor Algeria has publicly offered evidence for the claims, and Mr. Shapiro declined to comment on the matter.

Mr. Shapiro also said the State Department is seeking more funds for the effort — first another $1.5 million, then possibly more.

As the operation gains traction, the ammunition bunkers here in western Libya — whether intact or shattered by NATO — have been extensively scavenged, just as bunkers were in the country’s east. And there are signs of fresh missile diversion.

Inside the depot, two more emptied SA-7 cases were visible beside a ransacked bunker. A 15-minute drive from the depot entrance, at a place where several men were sipping tea by the road, two intact SA-7s were visible in a wooden crate. The weapons were complete and appeared to be in good condition.

A man eagerly demonstrated how to assemble the three components — grip stock, missile tube and battery/cooling unit. During another visit by two journalists, someone in the desert outside the depot fired one of the missiles into the air.

Rebel guards and officers offered insights into factors that allowed such weapons to end up on the side of the road in this way — including rebels who know little of weapons, undisciplined forces and inadequate security.

On the day Ga’a was captured, rebels and local men were seen carrying away crates of SA-7s, even though — given that the only aircraft over the battlefields are from NATO — they did not need them for the fighting.

The rebel military said that this diversion was the ordinary confusion of an untrained force made up of civilians, many of whom assumed the missiles could be useful in a ground war. “They think, ‘I have this missile and I will not use it against aircraft, I will use it against a tank,’ ” said Col. Juma Ibrahim, a rebel military spokesman. Another officer said rebels are not allowed to bring any missile that can be used against planes to the front lines. “Our fighters are forbidden from using them,” said Col. Mukhtar Farnana, the rebel military commander in western Libya.

But the rebel leadership has apparently taken few steps to collect the missiles its fighters carried away from Ga’a or to prevent more of them from leaking. And no one could explain the newly emptied Manpad crates in the sand.

The crates were in a pile that suggested that scavenging crews had cherry-picked the missiles from the ample collection of munitions inside the depot, removed them from their cases and loaded them on trucks.

Officially, the depot is closed to the public. Only rebels approved by the rebel military leadership are given access to the site.

But three visits to the depot in the past 10 days found many people roaming its ruined grounds, including, the guards said, people they allowed to take empty wooden crates for use as firewood or as storage containers in their homes.

When trucks departed with crates, the drivers sometimes honking horns, the guards did not check to see if the crates were empty, or search some of the trucks at all.
379 2011-07-15 THE new secretary of defense, Leon E. Panetta, will soon face the challenge of significantly reducing the Pentagon’s budget. As directed by President Obama, he will have to find at least $400 billion of savings over the next 12 years, or $33 billion per year — about 5 percent of the current annual defense budget. His decisions will reshape our armed forces for decades to come and determine whether we live in a more or less dangerous world.

Having overseen the preparation and execution of the defense budget, I urge Mr. Panetta to resist the temptation to quickly kill procurement programs and research and development activities. Nor should he make proportional cuts to programs across the board. History shows that this would result in a hollowed-out force that will embolden our enemies. It’s the easiest way to go, but also the worst.

Instead, Mr. Panetta should first cut the department’s civilian workforce before reducing the size of the military force. The Pentagon rightly pressures industry to reduce overhead costs, but it is far more inefficient itself. Starting in 2003, the number of active military sailors was reduced by over 60,000, but efforts to cut the Navy’s civilian workforce failed due to onerous government and union rules and regulations. Mr. Panetta should seek blanket authority from Congress to shrink the Pentagon bureaucracy. Cutting 100,000 of 700,000 is a reasonable target. And there should be no additional outsourcing, thereby forcing the Pentagon to operate more efficiently.

Second, Washington must do more to encourage the sale of defense equipment to our friends and allies abroad, like the littoral combat ship, the mine-resistant ambush-protected armored vehicle and a host of other combat and combat-support equipment. Manufacturing equipment for the American and foreign militaries simultaneously saves Washington money because more units are produced and overhead costs are shared, and it creates thousands of American jobs. The savings generated by international sales are too big to ignore, yet in too many cases the Pentagon has been only lukewarm in supporting such sales.

Third, the Pentagon should put a moratorium on starting any new procurement programs. Instead, it should use the money to increase the rate of production on existing ones and complete them faster and for less. All too often, the Defense Department fails to control its appetite, with too few dollars chasing too many programs. The result is the formation of “procurement death spirals,” during which the Pentagon buys fewer and fewer units at higher and higher prices.

Fourth, the new secretary of defense should adjust the military’s “tooth-to-tail ratio” — the ratio of fighters to support personnel — which is increasingly out of balance. During my time at the Pentagon, a large number of Army soldiers never deployed to a combat zone, whereas many of those who did were sent multiple times. Mr. Panetta should concentrate on cutting administrative workers — not the fighting force, intelligence personnel and front-line maintenance troops. Such cuts would greatly increase efficiency.
380 2011-07-15 Sadness and longing haunt the films of the French director Julie Bertuccelli, whose gorgeous second feature, “The Tree,” is set in Queensland, Australia, on the outskirts of Brisbane. Here, on the edge of the outback, the environment is so luminous that every outdoor shot has an aura of magical realism.

The title refers to a marvelous, many-limbed tree, a Moreton Bay fig, that rises like a giant, woody mushroom with cradling arms next to the ramshackle farmhouse of the O’Neils, a family of six. Both a protective canopy and an intrusive menace with an aggressive root system, the tree is as much a character in the movie as any of the humans; it is also, of course, a potent, all-purpose metaphor.

The fig tree is an organic part of the house, with its roots running above and below ground and its branches clinging to the exterior. The house may be filled with children, but the tree teems with an equally busy life of insects, birds and worms. The movie also pays conspicuous attention to the other neighborhood wildlife, including a scary bat that invades the kitchen and frogs that pop up in a toilet.

The movie is truly a tree-hugger’s delight (I confess to being one such hugger) that makes the most of its metaphors without straining toward supernatural schmaltz. That’s not easy in a story that has many of the qualities of a fairy tale and that practically demands the kind of happy ending that the film, with its tone of muted optimism, is unwilling to supply.

The family’s rustic idyll is shattered when Peter (Aden Young), the robust and handsome paterfamilias who earns a decent living transporting houses to the outback, dies of a heart attack at the wheel of his truck, which comes to rest at the foot of the tree. Because Peter and his lithe, athletic wife, Dawn (Charlotte Gainsbourg), were mutually besotted, his death is an excruciating loss. Left alone to bring up their four children, Dawn struggles with depression but eventually regains her equilibrium.
381 2011-07-15 When the Beatles played at Shea Stadium on Aug. 15, 1965 (and again on Aug. 23, 1966), I was a little puzzled, maybe even a little miffed, at their choice of location. As an 11-year-old I had what I figured was a clear idea of what was right and proper, and to me the spanking new Shea Stadium was the home of the Mets, an upstart team that seemed destined forever to inhabit the basement in the National League standings, and not, therefore, the kind of place that deserved the Beatles’ magic. As I saw it, the Beatles were to music as the Yankees were to baseball, and if they were going to play at a baseball stadium, Yankee Stadium was the place for them.

I admit that there were other, equally silly ways of looking at it. You could reason, for example, that playing at Shea was perfect: The Yankees were the Establishment, and the Mets, like the Beatles, were the feisty newcomers, eager to take on the world. And as it turned out, it took the Mets only seven years to become regarded as miraculous — roughly the amount of time that elapsed between John Lennon’s formation of the Quarry Men and the Beatles’ first big hit.

At any rate, Paul McCartney appears to have seen the error of his youthful ways: Friday and Saturday he is playing at Yankee Stadium, as the kickoff — whoops, wrong metaphor — of a brief tour of ball fields. Granted, Mr. McCartney played at the new Citi Field, Shea’s replacement, in July 2009, but I think that was a fundamentally clerical decision. Since the Beatles were the first band to play at the “old” Shea, Mr. McCartney wanted pride of place at the new stadium too. And my inner Yankee fan bristled less at his decision to play there than at his visit to Fenway Park a few weeks later.

One could argue, of course, that Mr. McCartney is the honorary owner of the stadium circuit. The Beatles’ Shea concerts are generally acknowledged as the beginning of the stadium rock phenomenon, and baseball stadiums quickly became part of the Beatles legend. Their last public concert, after all, was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, on Aug. 29, 1966 (unless you count the 1969 “rooftop concert” in London, which was really less a public concert than an outdoor recording session).

In a way the Beatles and stadium rock stumbled into each other unprepared. The Beatles, at the time, were using amplifiers less powerful than those in most people’s living room stereo systems today. And stadium public-address systems were designed for announcements and a bit of organ music, not for the pounding beat and rich instrumental textures of a rock band. Not that it mattered in the Beatles’ case: all that could be heard was the shrill roar of 56,000 screeching fans, and better amplification would hardly have helped. But a great deal of technical innovation was required before stadium shows could be regarded as anything like artistic experiences, let alone the gargantuan, carefully choreographed audio-video productions they are today.
382 2011-07-15 Mayor La Guardia was appalled. Out for a walk one day in Manhattan in 1942, he happened upon a store displaying a copy of a periodical called Spicy Mystery. In lurid hues and slashing graphic style, its cover pictured a curvaceous, terrified young woman in a partly shredded dress hanging by bound hands from a hook alongside slabs of meat. She was menaced by a demented, knife-wielding brute of a man who looked back over his shoulder at whoever was holding the gun that cast its shadow on him. Shocked and dismayed, the mayor vowed to ban all such scurrilous literature from his fair city.

Now the original painting by Hugh J. Ward that was reproduced on the cover of that offending publication is on view, along with almost 90 other racy and bloodcurdling confections of similar ilk, in “Pulp Art: The Robert Lesser Collection,” an entertaining and fascinating exhibition at the Museum of American Illustration at the Society of Illustrators. Each is framed, along with a copy of the periodical whose contents it so enticingly previewed. Almost all are from the holdings of Robert Lesser, a collector and connoisseur of popular visual culture.

The pulps — so called because they were printed on cheap paper made from wood pulp — were invented by an entrepreneur named Frank A. Munsey in the early 1880s. His first magazine, The Golden Argosy, was for children. It was later called just Argosy and eventually became for adult men only. Other publishers followed Munsey’s lead, and for the first half of the 20th century pulp fiction supplied escapist fantasies of adventure and erotic excitement in abundance for a newly literate, mostly working-class population.

Despite the considerable amusement quotient, there is nothing here that you would mistake for seriously good art. These artists were all highly competent professionals well trained in the basics of figurative painting, but pulp illustration was hack work. It called not for original, personal expression and technique but for imagery appealing to the lowest common denominator of popular taste and imagination.

With screaming colors and stark contrasts of light and shadow, pulp artists put Expressionist style in the service of eye-grabbing sensationalism. It is what pulp art reveals about the desires and anxieties of the American collective unconscious — and how baldly it does so — that makes it interesting and often unintentionally comical.

The most common motif is the sexy damsel in distress. In one picture after another, an underdressed young woman is menaced: tied to a psychotic archer’s target; threatened by a ladle of glowing molten metal; attacked by submarine monsters; abducted by gangsters; grabbed by ghouls of indeterminate origin. One of the oddest and funniest pictures is Frank Rudolph Paul’s illustration for a story titled “Planet of the Knob Heads” in a 1939 issue of Science Fiction. A nearly naked woman is carried away by a red, pear-shaped robot with a bumpy dome of a head; he is galloping on two legs, with gun-firing men on motorcycles in hot pursuit.
383 2011-07-15 The inquiry was expected to be handled jointly by two F.B.I. squads in the bureau’s New York office, one that investigates cybercrimes and another that focuses on public corruption and white-collar crimes, two of the people said. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.

It was not immediately clear whether federal prosecutors in Manhattan were involved in the case; they would most likely have jurisdiction over any prosecution because the 9/11 victims and their cellphones were in Manhattan when they died.

Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, also declined to comment.

Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington, said: “The department does not comment specifically on investigations, though anytime we see evidence of wrongdoing, we take appropriate action. The department has received letters from several members of Congress regarding allegations related to News Corporation, and we’re reviewing those.”

Jack Horner, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment.

Mr. King said in his letter on Wednesday that he was requesting the investigation not only as the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Homeland Security, but also as a congressman whose district lost more than 150 people in the 9/11 attacks. “It is my duty to discern every fact behind these allegations,” he wrote.

He cited recent news reports, apparently referring to an article first published on Monday in The Daily Mirror, a chief competitor to The News of the World, which was closed down on Sunday as a result of the scandal. The article said reporters working for the newspaper had contacted a private investigator, a former New York police officer, and offered to pay him to retrieve the phone numbers of 9/11 victims and get details of the calls they had made and received in the days leading up to the attacks.

“If these allegations are proven true,” Mr. King wrote, “the conduct would merit felony charges for attempting to violate various federal statutes related to corruption of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping. Any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law.”

It is not clear whether the person referred to in the Daily Mirror article was a police officer at the time of the attacks.

At least five Democratic lawmakers, who all had previously been critical of the News Corporation, spoke out about the matter this week. Mr. King was the first Republican to call for an investigation into the activities of the company, whose chief executive, Mr. Murdoch, is a longtime supporter of conservative causes and Republican politicians.

Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, was the first to issue a statement on the matter, saying on Tuesday that the United States government should hold investigations to “ensure that Americans have not had their privacy violated.”

On Wednesday, he was joined by the two New Jersey senators, Robert Menendez and Frank R. Lautenberg. Senator Menendez asked the Justice Department to investigate the claims involving 9/11 victims, saying in his letter that the “large scope” of the hacking in Britain made it “imperative to investigate whether victims in the United States have been affected as well.”

Senator Lautenberg suggested that both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission should examine the case and consider opening a formal investigation. He cited news reports that journalists had “paid London police officers for information, including private telephone information, about the British royal family and other individuals for use in newspaper articles.”
384 2011-07-15 The subsidy programs are as varied as warehouses that allow farmers to store cotton and peanuts at government expense until prices rise and an estimated $100 million break for owners of racetracks. Various private and government studies show that nearly $1.8 trillion over the next five years could be saved by eliminating or reducing spending on some of the subsidies.

“You can’t blame the survival of these programs on just Democrats or Republicans, it’s both,” said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of , who has proposed cutting several of the programs. “But if we can’t cut small programs worth millions of dollars that benefit a few, how are we going to make serious cuts and get this country on the right track?”

A close look at two programs highlights the age-old politics protecting government spending. The peanut and cotton storage program, which costs $1 million a year, has repeatedly survived cuts thanks to bipartisan support. Under the program, the government picks up storage costs for cotton and peanut farmers when they defer selling crops until prices rise. The peanut storage credits have been around since 2002. The cotton subsidy dates to the 1990s.

President tried to eliminate the storage credits in 2008, specifically mentioning them when he vetoed the . But his veto was overridden by a bipartisan coalition of rural lawmakers who supported farm programs and legislators from urban areas who backed food stamp and school nutrition programs.

The Obama administration has twice tried to kill the storage program, but the National Cotton Council and the American Peanut Shellers Association, as well as lawmakers from cotton and peanut producing states like and , teamed up to save it.

The program’s biggest champion has been Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, whose district has many of the state’s nearly 3,000 peanut farmers. Mr. Bishop, a member of the Appropriations Committee, has for five years blocked efforts to cut the program, taking to the floor last month to denounce amendments to eliminate the credits.

“I’m in favor of making the necessary cuts needed to reduce our debt,” he said in an interview. “But it shouldn’t be made off the backs of farmers, the people who produce our food.”

Mr. Bishop’s allies include Representative Jack Kingston and Senator , both Republicans from Georgia. When the program was due to expire in 2007, Mr. Kingston, who is chairman of an agriculture appropriations subcommittee, pushed to continue it. After the White House tried to scrap the payments last year, Mr. Chambliss, a member of the Agriculture Committee, said the administration was “unfairly targeting farmers.”

But in an e-mail statement last week, Mr. Chambliss indicated that the program might not escape the Congressional ax.

“Everything must be on the table, and everyone must share in the budgeting pain,” he said.

Like the cotton and peanut payments, the Essential Air Service program is a survivor. It began in 1978 as a $7 million effort for 10 years to help small towns keep air service when airlines were deregulated. By 1996 it was permanent, and now costs about $200 million a year covering 150 mostly small and rural communities.

After President failed to eliminate it in 1985, Presidents and George W. Bush tried, only to see Congress add money to the program. This year, Senators of Arizona and of , both Republicans, proposed ending the program, but the Senate voted it down by a wide margin.

A 2009 government report found that low-cost airlines gave travelers more options than they had decades ago. Surveys by the Transportation Department show that in more than 90 percent of the communities, travelers said they were willing to drive 150 miles or more for cheaper fares.

Still, William Polacek, vice chairman of the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport Authority, said the program was critical to growth and economic development in the area. “Take away the flights and it would be really inconvenient for local businesses to get to other markets and for those who want to do business here,” he said.

Airport and aviation groups have repeatedly rallied in opposition to any cuts in the program.

Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association, said the program was modest government .

“It’s called essential for a reason,” Mr. Cohen said. “In many of these areas there is no other way to travel other than to drive for hours.”

A powerful coalition of rural and urban Democrats and Republicans agree, and have managed to save the program, even increase its financing this year to $200 million, up almost 50 percent.

When Mr. McCain proposed ending the program, he faced opposition from rural Republican lawmakers in and who joined Democrats from and . The coalition drew support from senators like , Democrat of New York, who said eliminating the subsidy would cost jobs and stifle growth. The Senate agreed to scale back the program to fewer cities. A House-approved bill would reduce financing for the program until 2013, before eliminating it except in and .

The House and Senate will work out their differences but already a bipartisan effort lead by Representatives Adrian Smith, Republican of Nebraska, and Michael H. Michaud, Democrat of , is under way to preserve the program.

Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group in Washington, predicted the subsidies might yet survive.

“These programs are like vampires, you just can’t kill them,” Mr. Bixby said. “Just when you think they are dead, they manage to rise up.”
385 2011-07-15 Producer prices declined in the United States in June, dragged down by a fall in energy prices like those for gasoline and electrical power, according to government statistics released Thursday.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that its index of wholesale prices fell 0.4 percent in June, after a rise of 0.2 percent in May. The decline last month was the steepest since February of last year and exceeded analysts’ forecasts of a 0.2 percent drop.

The 2.8 percent decrease in energy prices was the largest drop in that category since a 4.7 percent decrease in July 2009. Prices for gasoline, which had been rising in the first part of the year partly because of turmoil in Arab oil-producing countries, moved down 4.7 percent, the department said. The decline in energy prices more than offset the rise in food, which was up 0.6 percent in June.

When the volatile food and energy prices are extracted from the overall index, the core Producer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in June after a 0.2 percent increase in May, making it the seventh consecutive monthly rise.

The core index has risen 2.4 percent in the last year, the government report said.

That the core price index rose was “somewhat of a relief,” especially to the Federal Reserve, said Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance. “It is a sign we have gotten out of the deflationary danger zone.”

The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that a renewed threat of deflation was one condition that could cause the central bank to resume its economic aid campaign, called quantitative easing.
386 2011-07-15 Stocks fell on Thursday as Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, backed off hints that the Fed would provide additional near-term stimulus for the nation’s struggling economy.

In a second day of testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank would be ready to inject more money should the economy get worse. He said the time had not come yet, undercutting comments from a day earlier that spurred a late-day rally.

JPMorgan Chase rose 1.84 percent, to $40.35, after it reported higher-than-expected profit as it wrote off fewer bad mortgages and credit card loans. The Dow component was the only component of the Standard & Poor’s financial index to close higher.

“You’re seeing a push and pull, with earnings continuing to be strong on the micro level, but event-risk issues like Bernanke and global debt, on the other hand,” said Wayne Lin, a money manager at Legg Mason in Baltimore.

“The market is volatile, trading off these one-line comments from Bernanke.”

The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.49 points, or 0.44 percent, to 12,437.12. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shed 8.85 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,308.87. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 34.25 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,762.67.
387 2011-07-15 Childhood ends, this time forever, with tears and howls, swirls of smoke, the shock of mortality and bittersweet smiles in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” the grave, deeply satisfying final movie in the series. A pop cultural happening extraordinaire, the Potter movies took uncertain flight in 2001 with Harry, then an orphan of 11, home alone with his grotesquely unloving relatives. Times were grim, at least off screen — the first opened in November of that year — but Chris Columbus’s directorial touch was insistently light as Harry was initiated into a world alive with odd doings, strange creatures and the evil that would almost consume it.

A decade later Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), have become powerful adult wizards, while the actors are now stars. Look closely and you can see the beard inching along Harry’s, or rather Mr. Radcliffe’s pale chin. Meanwhile Ms. Watson, smoldering in bruising dark lipstick on the cover of the July Vogue, has her own hair and makeup artist, and the director, David Yates, even trains the camera on her generous peekaboo cleavage. Just as startling is the transformation of Mr. Grint who, in one early, anxious scene wears a goatee and a panicked look that together suggest a junior Paul Giamatti. My, how the children have grown — and the movies too.

It’s taken two of them to translate J. K. Rowling’s last, exhausting tome. A long windup to the new one’s big-bang finale, “Part 1” was memorable for the death of the house elf Dobby and less so for the draggy scenes of Harry, Hermione and Ron hiding and quarreling in the wild. There’s no time for adolescent angst in war. Now, when a student (he who shall not be named so as not to ruin the fun) declares his affection for another — the air electric with fire, frenzy and young love (if never lust) — it’s because, as he says, both may soon be dead. Fans of the books know how it turns out, and moviegoers can guess. Meanwhile this declaration, especially given the casualties to come, may fill you with feeling and also make you cry.

I did, partly because it’s been unexpectedly moving growing older with these characters and actors perhaps simply because it’s invariably poignant watching children become adults. However uneven they were at the start, the three young leads were irresistible simply because they were so young, unformed and vulnerable (like their characters). Ms. Watson was the most assured, while Mr. Grint was the natural (and still is). Mr. Radcliffe, button cute, capable, opaque, was tougher to warm up to. But it’s pointless to think of anyone else. He became Harry, Harry is him, and Mr. Radcliffe’s depthless quality now seems right for a character who, in the books and movies, was never as interesting as the magical world he revealed to us.

Mr. Radcliffe has evolved enough as a performer that he makes a steady hub for the busily spinning parts, even as Ms. Watson and Mr. Grint, whose characters are drifting toward their fate, have less to do. All three have nice moments in this movie, but it’s the older adults who take center stage. Much has rightly been made over the years about how the franchise became a platform for some of the best British actors working, a truism that brought it force and gravity as one after another great — Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Jason Isaacs — stepped up, often wonderfully. Here it’s Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman who give the master class in acting.

As Lord Voldemort, the evil wizard who could not be named for ages but has been for a while, Mr. Fiennes has been part of the mix since the fourth film (“The Goblet of Fire”). Over the course of the series, as Voldemort gathered in power and corporeality, his wrenched, Medusa-like face eventually growing a body (though oddly losing its nose), the actor started to fill out the character with sharp, indelible gestures, a flick of the wrist, a twist of the mouth. In “Part 2” his whispering hiss of a voice slithers into ears like a snake, seducing and terrorizing. But watch Mr. Fiennes’s hands, look as they flutter, their white, spidery fingers idling with exquisite delicacy as the long nails, sharpened into perfect arrows, threaten the worst.

396 2011-07-16 Apple won a preliminary ruling from a federal trade panel that a Taiwanese handset maker, the HTC Corporation, had infringed on two of its patents. HTC, which uses Google’s Android operating system for its smartphones, said it would fight the infringement finding. An International Trade Commission administrative judge made the ruling on Friday, but the full commission must now rule on whether it will uphold or reverse its judge’s decision. The ruling, though preliminary, will be closely dissected as it is one of the first between Apple and other smartphone makers that use Android. Smartphone technology has spawned a wealth of patent litigation. Apple has also filed complaints against Samsung Electronics, which also uses the Android software platform. Apple recently settled a case against Nokia. Microsoft and Motorola have also filed smartphone-related lawsuits against each other. A final determination in the case is due on Dec. 6.
397 2011-07-16 Mr. Lugo was arrested last week in the theft of a Picasso drawing in San Francisco, where he is being held on $5 million bail. He pleaded not guilty to that charge Friday.

“I think there is some psychiatric episode going on,” his lawyer, Douglas I. Horngrad, said. “Everything we’ve heard that Mark has taken, he’s apparently taken in a short period of time, with no indication of any such activity before then. So this sounds like the act of someone in the middle of a compulsive episode.”

In the five-story brick building on Washington Street where Mr. Lugo had lived for at least five years, neighbors described him as friendly but quiet, someone who worked late, slept during the day and hosted parties. His girlfriend was often there, they said, with a King Charles spaniel puppy.

Neighbors had no idea what treasures the apartment contained, but one, Brett Manwaring, got a glimpse of Mr. Lugo’s artistic sense when the building’s exterior was repainted bluish gray.

With the new color, “he was happy to have guests over,” Mr. Manwaring said. “He enjoyed the aesthetics.”

Mr. Lugo has been charged with the April theft of three bottles of Château Pétrus Pomerol, worth a total of $6,000, from Gary’s Wines in Wayne, N.J. The wine has not been recovered.

The New York Police Department said the 11 artworks recovered in Hoboken were taken from June 6 to July 1, from victims including the Chambers Hotel, the Opera Gallery, the Skot Foreman Fine Art Gallery and the Jack Shainman Gallery.

On the afternoon of June 27, a 1933 Picasso etching print disappeared from the William Bennett Gallery on Greene Street in SoHo. William Ledford, the gallery owner, said that the work, “Sculpteur et Deux Têtes (Sculptor and Two Heads),” is somewhat bigger than a legal pad, and worth about $30,000.

That night, someone stole a Léger work of India ink on linen from a lobby area of the Carlyle Hotel on East 76th Street, whose security staff notified the Police Department at 3:30 a.m.

The Léger, “Composition aux Elements Mécaniques (Composition of Mechanical Elements),” dates to 1917, and had been on loan to the hotel for a few years from the Helly Nahmad Gallery, nearby on Madison Avenue, said Christina Warner, assistant director of the gallery. She said the work, smaller than a letter-size sheet of paper, is worth $350,000, making it the most valuable item Mr. Lugo has been accused of taking.

On July 4, the police said, Mr. Lugo flew to San Francisco. The next day, a Picasso pencil drawing from 1965, “Tête de Femme (Head of a Woman),” was stolen there from the Weinstein Gallery, near Union Square. Rowland Weinstein, the gallery owner, said the drawing, similar in size to the Léger, was worth more than $200,000.

It appears the thief made little effort to evade detection.

“As far as we can tell,” Mr. Ledford said, “he just took it off the wall.”

At the Carlyle, security cameras recorded a man matching Mr. Lugo’s description entering the building, and then exiting with a small package a short time later, the authorities said.

Mr. Weinstein said that one of his employees had seen a man leave the gallery and get into a taxi with what appeared to be an artwork, not wrapped up as it would be after a sale. “She took down the taxi number, ran back inside, saw that it was gone, and called the police,” he said.

The San Francisco police quickly tracked down the driver, who said the passenger had mentioned the Hotel Palomar. “Almost immediately, they had video of him from in the cab, from the hotel, and from Lefty O’Doul’s restaurant near us, and they knew his name,” Mr. Weinstein said.

The police arrested Mr. Lugo the next day in Napa Valley and recovered the Picasso drawing.

Mr. Ledford and Mr. Weinstein said they immediately upgraded their security systems. Thefts are rare because stolen art is hard to sell, they said, but the case should make galleries reconsider their security.

“No doubt there is a sense of embarrassment,” Mr. Ledford said. “But I feel like this was our ‘get out of jail free’ card. We learned a valuable lesson without having to pay a heavy price.”
398 2011-07-16 ALBANY (AP) — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who led the effort to legalize same-sex marriage in New York, received $60,000 in campaign money from one of the state’s leading gay-rights groups, according to campaign finance records filed Friday with the State Board of Elections.

The check from the group, Empire State Pride Agenda, was one of the biggest among the $5.5 million in contributions Mr. Cuomo has received since January. It is a big haul for any governor, and it has come as Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, racked up big political wins in his first six months in office.

Lawmakers who were instrumental in legalizing same-sex marriage last month also saw big contributions from supporters of the legislation, according to the Board of Elections filings.

“The fervid campaign in support of gay marriage filled both the halls of the State Capitol and legislators’ wallets,” Bill Mahoney, research coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said.

Mr. Mahoney added, however, that Mr. Cuomo’s biggest benefactors remain the traditional lobbying powers: businesses that support his initiative to cap property tax increases; landlords, developers and tenant advocates who sought the renewal of New York City’s rent control laws; and contributors with interests in health care and education.
399 2011-07-16 The increasingly urgent cries to resolve the debt-ceiling stalemate — from Wall Street, bond rating companies, the Federal Reserve chairman, the White House, the Senate and pretty much everyone else — seem unable to penetrate the soundproof bunker built by House Republicans. Their leaders announced on Friday that they would waste precious days next week on a hopeless crusade for spending caps and a balanced budget amendment.

The measure they propose would make a radical cut of $111 billion in 2012, then limit federal spending to 19.9 percent of the gross domestic product by 2017, far less than the current 25 percent and not nearly enough for Americans’ needs. It says the debt ceiling could go up only if Congress approved a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, a meaningless proviso since Republicans don’t have the necessary two-thirds majority even in the House, let alone the Senate.

At this late stage, this plan is a dangerous delusion suggesting that the House leadership regards the gravity of a default as seriously as it does global warming. Perhaps it didn’t notice that Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, said on Thursday that the failure to raise the debt ceiling would most likely have “detrimental and long-lasting” effects on economic growth.

President Obama took to the microphone yet again on Friday to plead for his overly generous offer to the Republicans to cut up to $3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade — including disturbing reductions in entitlement spending — in exchange for modest increases in tax revenues, which he noted that most Americans supported. It remains astonishing that Republicans spurned an offer that would have drawn cries of protest from many Democrats. (We don’t like it either.)

They did so in order to proudly reject the slightest hint of tax increases, but as the president pointed out on Friday, the interest-rate jump produced by a default would end up being a more onerous tax on everyone.

Mr. Obama dismissed the coming House vote as “a political statement,” and even Speaker John Boehner suggested that the real action would come after his members waved their balanced budget flags. Senate leaders are working on a plan that would lift the ceiling in exchange for a more modest package of cuts. Though the proposal seems to lack necessary tax revenue increases, it remains the most likely vehicle to end the crisis. But first the crush of reality will have to persuade the House to vote for it.
400 2011-07-16 “Catastrophic.” “Calamitous.” “Major crisis.” “Self-inflicted wound.” Those are some of the ways , the chairman of the , has described the fallout if Congress fails to raise the by the Aug. 2 deadline.

In Congressional testimony this week, Mr. Bernanke also warned that the Fed would not be able to fully counter the damage from a default, including the possibility that spiking interest rates would roil borrowers worldwide and worsen the deficit by making it costlier to finance the nation’s debt.

That’s not all of it. Brinkmanship over the debt limit is only one of many epic economic policy blunders now in the making. Even if lawmakers raise the debt limit on time, the economy is weak and getting weaker, as evidenced by slowing growth and rising unemployment.

Instead of coming up with policies to strengthen the economy, the Republicans are demanding deep, immediate spending cuts, which would only add to current weakness. The White House, meanwhile, has suggested cuts should be phased in slowly and has said that more near-term help would be good for the economy. That is a better approach. But has done too little to argue the case, on Capitol Hill or with the public.

Upfront spending cuts could make sense if the budget deficit were the cause of the current economic weakness. If it were, interest rates would be rising, not at generational lows, as the government competed with the private sector. The real cause is lack of consumer demand in the face of stagnant wages, job uncertainty and the continuing payback of household debt from the bubble years. Without strong and steady consumer demand, businesses will not hire, and a self-sustaining recovery cannot take hold.
401 2011-07-16 Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra have taken up residence at Avery Fisher Hall for a series — part of the Lincoln Center Festival — called “Bruckner: (R)evolution,” in which Bruckner symphonies are juxtaposed with works by John Adams. It is an odd pairing, built on Mr. Welser-Möst’s interesting assertion that Bruckner is “the grandfather of Minimalism.”

How is that? Both Bruckner and the Minimalists wrote big works that evolve gradually over long stretches of time, and if Bruckner’s symphonic wanderings do indeed point toward Minimalism, his music is revolutionary. Or something.

The second installment of the series, on Thursday evening, pointed up a few problems with this conceit. One was apparent at a glance: the works at hand — Mr. Adams’s 1993 Violin Concerto and the Bruckner Seventh Symphony — are about as far from Minimalism as you can get.

The Bruckner, with its huge, variegated textures; generous dynamic range; and winding, if not serpentine, themes, is an essay in 19th-century maximalism, and nothing screams High Romanticism louder than the brass climaxes scattered throughout the work.

Mr. Adams, for the last couple of decades, has been less a Minimalist than an eclectic neo-Romantic, and his Violin Concerto has more in common with the Berg and Bartok concertos than with any of the classic Minimalist scores, including Mr. Adams’s own.

Granted, there were moments in Mr. Welser-Möst’s commanding reading of the Bruckner that showed what he might have in mind. A recurring theme in the work’s great Adagio is built on three rising chords, repeated by different sections of the orchestra, and elsewhere in the movement, a musical gesture sprouts from repeating scale figures. But repetition and scale figures do not equal Minimalism, and if they did, Beethoven and Wagner would have a far stronger claim to being proto-Minimalists than Bruckner.
402 2011-07-16 WASHINGTON — The State Department on Friday published the results of a new lottery to give residents’ visas to 55,000 foreigners around the world, running the drawing for the second time after a computer error forced officials to cancel the first one.

The new round of the lottery was deeply disappointing to about 22,000 foreigners who were advised by the State Department in May after the first drawing that they had received the residents’ visas, known as green cards. Officials determined that it had not been truly random, as the law requires, and the winners were notified days later that they would not be receiving documents to live permanently in the United States after all.

On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington dismissed a lawsuit against the State Department brought by the frustrated winners of the first round. The ruling by Judge Amy B. Jackson cleared the way for the department to post the results of the new drawing on its Web site on Friday.

The drawing, which is known as the diversity lottery, is designed to give scarce, highly coveted green cards to foreigners from countries that do not generally send many immigrants to the United States.

In the new drawing, 100,000 people were chosen from a pool of about 15 million applicants from around the world, State Department officials said. On a first-come-first-served basis, they can now move forward to the next steps in the process: presenting identity documents, passing background tests and undergoing consular interviews. A total of 55,000 green cards will be granted.

State Department officials said they were confident that the computer glitch was corrected. “Needless to say, the names and results were carefully analyzed and vetted and re-vetted before they were posted,” said Rosemary Macray, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department.
403 2011-07-16 BEIJING — Some nations have strategic oil reserves. Some keep grain reserves. China has both, and something others have somehow overlooked: a national pork reserve.

And with the price of pig meat up 38 percent in major cities since the start of the year, the government is about to open its floodgates.

China’s Commerce Ministry said Friday that it planned to release part of the central government’s 200,000-metric-ton stash of frozen pork onto the market, following earlier releases from pork reserves held by cities and at least 11 provinces trying to cap rising food prices.

So far, they have failed. Year-over-year inflation in China rose to 6.4 percent in June. The ministry says the price of pork in big cities soared by 17 percent last month alone, propelled by higher feed prices, rising wages and increased demand.

“As we know, pig breeding has experienced consecutive increases the last three years,” the ministry’s spokesman, Yao Jian, said at a briefing on Friday. “But with the progress of urbanization and increasing consumption of pork by the people, market control faces new challenges on the quantity of pork consumption.”

If a reliable supply of pig meat does not sound like a national priority, consider this: pork makes up more than half the meat consumed in China, and up to 70 percent in some areas, China’s state-run CCTV television network reported in May.
404 2011-07-16 But the S.E.C. has become a favorite whipping boy of those hostile to market reforms. Admittedly the agency has given them plenty of fodder: revelations that a few staff members were looking at pornography on their office computers; a questionable $557 million lease for new office space, subsequently unwound; and the agency’s notorious failure to catch Bernard Madoff. Nonetheless, in the wake of the recent Ponzi schemes, evidence of growing insider-trading rings involving the and others, potential market manipulation in the still-mystifying flash crash, not to mention myriad unanswered questions about wrongdoing during the financial crisis, the need for vigorous securities law enforcement seems both self-evident and compelling.

A bribery scandal at Tyson Foods — a scheme that Tyson itself admitted — resulted in charges against the company earlier this year. But no individuals were charged. While the S.E.C. wouldn’t disclose its reasons, the case involved foreign witnesses and was therefore expensive to investigate and prosecute. The decision not to pursue charges may have involved many factors, but one disturbing possibility was that the agency simply couldn’t afford to, given its limited resources.

Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s head of enforcement, told me his division was underfunded even before Dodd-Frank expanded its responsibilities and that the proposed appropriation would leave his division in dire straits. The S.E.C. oversees more than 35,000 publicly traded companies and regulated institutions, not counting the hedge fund advisers that would be added under the new legislation. While he wouldn’t comment on Tyson, he noted that with fixed costs like salaries accounting for nearly 70 percent of the agency’s budget, “you have to squeeze the savings out of what’s left, like travel, and especially foreign travel, at a time we see more globalization, more insider trading through offshore accounts. It’s highly cost-intensive.”

An S.E.C. memo on the committee’s proposed budget warns: “We may be forced to decline to prosecute certain persons who violate the law; settle cases on terms we might otherwise not prefer; name fewer defendants in a given action; restrict the types of investigative techniques employed; or conclude investigations earlier than we otherwise would.”

It’s not just that cases aren’t being adequately investigated and filed. Under Mr. Khuzami and the S.E.C.’s chairwoman, , the enforcement division has tried to be more proactive, detecting complex frauds before they cost investors billions. Mr. Khuzami stressed that analyzing trading patterns involves a staggering amount of data, especially the that crippled markets during last year’s flash crash, and requires in state-of-the-art information technology the S.E.C. lacks. Sorting through the wreckage of the crisis, with its complex and millions of mortgages bundled into esoteric trading vehicles, is highly labor-intensive.

By way of comparison, in 2009 and , two institutions the S.E.C. regulates, spent $4.6 billion each — four times the S.E.C.’s entire annual budget — on information technology alone. Under the House’s proposed budget, the S.E.C.’s resources for technology would be cut by $10 million and a $50 million reserve fund earmarked for technology would be eliminated.

If anything, the agency’s failure to detect the Madoff scheme despite four ineffectual investigations would argue in favor of more, not less, enforcement spending. One investigation foundered when the Madoff team was abruptly shifted to market timing, since the S.E.C. lacked the manpower to do both. An important tip got lost in the system because of inadequate tracking mechanisms. Another Madoff investigation didn’t get logged into the computer system, so one office didn’t know what the other was doing. And the most glaring problem identified by the S.E.C.’s inspector general was that investigators lacked the expertise to ask the right questions.

Mr. Khuzami said the agency had addressed all the Madoff issues that didn’t involve additional funding. But “at some point you have to develop the expertise. We’ve done some hiring, but that is threatened now.” One consequence of the proposed appropriation is “to essentially freeze hiring for 2012,” according to the S.E.C. memo.

It’s hard to believe that enforcing the securities laws — most of which long predate the recent Dodd-Frank reforms — would be a partisan issue. Yet it has sparked a fierce ideological clash, with Republicans lining up to criticize the agency and withhold funds. “Republicans are falsely invoking the deficit to effectively repeal Dodd-Frank,” Representative , Democrat of , said. “These people are ideologues.” My requests for comment to two vocal critics of the S.E.C. in Congress —Representatives Spencer Bachus, the House Committee on Financial Services chairman from , and Scott Garrett of , both Republicans — went unanswered.

Given the magnitude of the S.E.C.’s task, Congress could make Wall Street firms pay more and not less to police the mess they helped create. A government that wants to hold wrongdoers’ feet to the fire and prevent future abuses could finance an S.E.C. enforcement surge analogous to the military’s strategy in and . Congress could fully finance the S.E.C.’s requested $1.4 billion — and add another $100 million for technology spending. The $1.5 billion would be paid entirely through fees. Financing the S.E.C. adds nothing to the federal deficit and, on the contrary, will help reduce it. It is an investment that would most likely generate increased fines and penalties that could be returned to defrauded investors and taxpayers.

“People say we aren’t charging enough individuals,” Mr. Khuzami said. “But we have a strong enforcement record. We aren’t acting recklessly, or operating in the gray areas, but rather bringing cases involving real frauds and misconduct and returning funds to victims.  We need funding to continue those efforts, efforts that even ” — the noted free market economist — “conceded were an appropriate role for government.”
405 2011-07-16 For now, however, the bureau is for real, and in an avalanche of Twitter messages, e-mails and blog comments on its Web site, consumers have shown a hunger for a financial cop on the beat.

Meanwhile, its openness thus far suggests the tantalizing possibility that it could be the nation’s first open-source regulator. So I picked the four most interesting ideas that people on Twitter suggested and took them to the bureau this week to see just how open it was to provocative suggestions.

SIMPLICITY Perhaps the most reasoned call to action came from Bill Mitchell (Twitter handle: @zipflash), an investment newsletter publisher and soon-to-be hedge fund manager in Irvine, Calif.

“My politics don’t really align with Elizabeth Warren’s,” he said. “But I sensed that she had a legitimate interest in trying to, at a minimum, improve efficiencies.”

So he took his best shot at helping her do that in a couple of Twitter messages. “Create standardized contract for credit cards for issuers to incorporate by reference, merely adjusting specific rates and fees.”

And then: “Limit the total number of words in consumer financial contracts. Disclosures are not transparent if their length is unlimited.”

Mr. Mitchell said he worried that credit card agreements had become like the software and Web agreements that so many people mindlessly speed through.

“We are actively working toward simplifying credit card contracts,” said Gail Hillebrand, associate director of consumer education and engagement for the bureau.

At the moment, the bureau is in the midst of an overhaul of mortgage disclosure forms, something Congress demanded. Congress hasn’t ordered the bureau to revise card agreements, though, and it is not clear how much authority the bureau would have to force card issuers’ hands if it decided to try.

Still, it’s clear that Ms. Warren is a believer in the religion of simplicity. “We are opposed to complicated forms and fine print,” she said Thursday in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

HUMOR Matt Stoller (@matthewstolller), a former Democratic Congressional staff member, just wants a good laugh. “Hold a weekly public complaint essay contest called ‘Why You Should Fine My Bank,’ ” he said in a Twitter post.

In all seriousness, this would have its advantages once the bureau’s novelty wears out, since it would keep consumers coming back looking for the most outrageous sins. Mr. Stoller, in an interview this week, added that the bureau should have a bank-as-hero letter of the week, too, as an incentive for good behavior.

“I think humor and interestingness are not used by government nearly enough,” he said. “To the extent that you do that, you create a situation where if you get a malevolent politician in there trying to kill these programs, then they have to kill something that the public likes.”

The bureau’s Ms. Hillebrand wouldn’t go near the self-preservation angle but got a good chuckle out of Mr. Stoller’s contest notion. “We have to learn from the most effective techniques that people inside and outside of government are using to reach the public,” she said. “If it’s funny, it gets forwarded.”

Then again, she added, financial troubles are no laughing matter. “It’s painful,” she said. “We need to be respectful of that while still communicating our message.”

BANKRUPTCY Right around the time the bureau started soliciting ideas earlier this year, Bryan Lucas (@bryanlucas) was clearing away his debts in bankruptcy court. Almost immediately, the loan solicitations came pouring into his Littleton, Colo., mailbox. So he was moved to reach out to the bureau. “Stop predatory lawyers and car dealers from sending letters offering car loans to people waiting for their bankruptcy to discharge,” he said via Twitter.

To people who experience this, it’s almost as if they’ve checked out of rehab only to find drug dealers lined up on the nearest corner. “Give me a cooling-off period to not have that temptation,” he said in an interview. “Because not everyone can say ‘I don’t need that.’ ”

This sort of request puts the bureau in a tough spot. On one hand, pushing sky-high interest loans on the bankrupt would meet plenty of people’s definition of predatory. But politically, the bureau can’t support anything that reduces access to credit, given that many Republicans insist the bureau’s very existence is already slowing economic activity.

The bureau declined the opportunity to endorse Mr. Lucas’s proposal.

FIDUCIARY As Mr. Lucas’s situation suggests, it isn’t always easy for every lender to know what’s best for any given customer. But Jillayne Schlicke (@jillayne) argues that it’s within the realm of the possible for mortgage lenders, so much so that they ought to figure it out and act on it.

“Make all loan originators owe fiduciary duties to their clients,” she wrote on Twitter, using the financial industry’s term for acting solely in a customer’s best interest.

This isn’t the first time Ms. Schlicke has made this suggestion. She makes a living doing continuing education for real estate salespeople and lenders in the Seattle area and started the National Association of Mortgage Fiduciaries to push for this view.

“It was horrifying to learn that people were using government forms designed to teach borrowers about loans to trick people and deceive them,” Ms. Schlicke said in an interview this week. So she sent off another Twitter message, addressing how loan officers see the Truth in Lending Act-mandated form: “Replace the TILA disclosure form. Most LOs can’t explain it and consumers can’t figure it out by themselves.”

The bureau posted a supportive video response from its policy adviser, Pam Blumenthal, to the second message right away, something Ms. Schlicke had not seen until I pointed it out to her. “Ha!” she said, as she watched it play. “Hey, she agrees with me. That’s cool.”

As for the fiduciary issue, however, the bureau did not want to comment. To Ms. Schlicke, the connection between her two suggestions is obvious. “Put the duty of care on the person sitting across the table. Make them take care of the client,” she said. “Instead of the opposite, which is to give them a two-inch stack of paper and say, ‘You take care of everything in it.’ ”

It is still early in the life of the bureau, a time when employees work late trying to read everything and almost anything seems possible.

“There is a lot of powerful information out in the public that we need to hear and a lot of good ideas in this building” said Ms. Hillebrand of the bureau. “And the two of them are going to add up to three.”

But whether this open-source effort adds up to more than the sum of its parts will depend on a couple of things.

First, there is the possibility that all of this openness is just window dressing aimed at generating public support as the bureau and Ms. Warren continue to come under regular attack from politicians. Once it is up and running and utterly overwhelmed, the bureau could easily slip toward behaving like any other faceless regulator.

Consumers could lose interest, too. You’ll have your next shot at proving how much you care next Thursday, when the bureau will begin taking complaints about credit card issuers.

Then there are those politicians. Because the bureau has no official director yet, it can’t regulate most nonbank institutions. And given the rancor around everything from the budget on down, there is simply no telling when — or if — your elected officials may ever be willing to confirm someone for the job.
406 2011-07-16 But its reform has proven tentative. Officials seem to offer little more than the model of under President — a tame but legal opposition, a measure of freedom of the press and expression.

Even that model seems uncertain, as a government with pretenses of modernizing Syria has fallen back on security forces to impose its control in restive regions. It claims that hundreds from the forces have died in fights with Islamist insurgents, backed from abroad.

Activists contend that their protests remain peaceful and that 1,400 people have died needlessly.

“I am pessimistic,” said Muntaha al-Atrash, a member of Sawasiah, a human rights group in Damascus. “I feel like it’s going to be a long, long journey.”

But in past weeks, the most potent forces in the uprising have shifted ground again: an evolving public and an indecisive government that failed to make what it celebrated as a national dialogue more than a conversation largely with itself.

“Every week, it becomes more and more apparent that not only can it not return to where it was before, but it’s already in the middle of transitioning anyway, and it’s going to be a really bumpy road,” an administration official in said on the condition of anonymity. “It’s going to be ugly, and I think that’s what scares people.”

Activists said the turnout Friday was perhaps the biggest yet, though still concentrated in regions that have proven most restive: Homs and Hama in central Syria, Deir al-Zour, and Qaboun and other suburbs of Damascus. The degree of organization in several of the rallies was striking, especially in Qaboun.

There, dozens of protesters protected local government buildings and the headquarters from vandalism, to deny security forces a pretext to crack down. A crowd that one witness estimated at 20,000 carried balloons, flags inscribed with mottos and banners. Activists relentlessly documented the scenes.

“We are more organized now,” said a 40-year-old shopkeeper in Qaboun who gave his name as Abu Khalid. “We’ve reached the point of no return.”

When security forces opened fire — after they were provoked, according to the government — protesters built barricades to block their way. In marked contrast to the fear that long reigned in Syria, the scenes in Qaboun evoked similar, recent scuffles in Hama with security forces that no longer inspire terror in the people they are meant to control.

“The people will not stop after all these sacrifices,” said a 30-year-old farmer who gave his name as Abu Mohammed and lives in another Damascus suburb, Kisweh.

In Hama, the center of the revolt, residents said they agreed to dismantle some barricades they built in past weeks as long as security forces let them demonstrate peacefully. In Deir al-Zour, where the momentum of the uprising seems to be shifting, tens of thousands turned out in the biggest protests yet, many of them gathering in a traffic circle formerly known as President Square and now renamed Freedom Square.

“A big and clear message,” one activist called the rally.

Syrian officials have acknowledged that some protesters have legitimate grievances, but still cast the uprising in terms used for another rebellion in the late 1970s and 1980s: Islamist insurgents carrying out foreign agendas.

While the protests seem overwhelmingly peaceful, signs have emerged of more violence lately, underscoring a familiar theme of conflicts in and . In the absence of a genuine political process, opponents resort to arms to press their demands. Residents speak of more people buying weapons, in places like Homs, and the prices of guns rising.

A banner hung two weeks ago in a Damascus neighborhood listed names of government informers and threatened revenge. Human rights activists say they have reports of nearly a dozen informers killed and many more wounded, often gravely.

Diplomats say they believe a gas pipeline that exploded in the east this week was probably an act of sabotage and not, as Syrian officials have portrayed it, an accident.

Opposition figures plan to meet Saturday in Damascus and in , and they hope to link the meetings through the Internet. But activists concede that the opposition is deeply divided, over ideology and personalities, threatening to scuttle the meeting in Istanbul.

Though the government allowed a rare opposition meeting last month, some fear it may seek to prevent the gathering in Damascus.

The economy is still reeling, with the Syrian pound losing value, growth slowing and the economy possibly contracting, tourism devastated and capital flowing out. One economist said the government had until the end of the year before facing the collapse that Mr. Assad mentioned in a speech last month. Others say he has far less time.

While Mr. Assad suggested the Constitution would be rewritten — a groundbreaking step, had it occurred four months ago — activists, and even those sympathetic to the government, see the much-touted national dialogue as an empty exercise.

“The situation is too far now from dialogue,” said Nabil Samman, director of the Center of Research and Documentation in Damascus. “The state can do something now, but if it doesn’t and if it doesn’t do it in the next week or so, I’m very pessimistic.”

410 2011-07-17 Mrs. Bachmann’s strong stance on homosexuality — she once likened it to “personal bondage, personal despair and personal enslavement” — and her anti-abortion views have appeal for some Republican primary voters. In Iowa this month, she delighted conservatives by signing a pledge opposing “any redefinition of marriage.” (Her fellow Minnesotan and presidential rival, Tim Pawlenty, a former governor, was left explaining why he did not.)

Yet her position has also become a distraction for her campaign, drawing critics and subjecting her family to the kind of scrutiny once reserved for the relatives of nominees. It has exposed a longstanding rift between the congresswoman and her stepsister, who is a lesbian. It has also raised questions about whether her husband, Marcus, who runs two Christian counseling centers, practices “reparative therapy,” or gay-to-straight counseling, derided by critics as an effort to “pray away the gay.”

For the Bachmanns, the issue is entwined with faith. Until recently, they were members of Salem Lutheran Church in Stillwater, part of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, which holds that “a believing member” cannot “remain a practicing homosexual in defiance of God’s word.” Friends say they now attend services at another evangelical church, Eagle Brook, closer to their new home in another Stillwater neighborhood.

“They are absolutely not against the gays,” said one close friend, JoAnne Hood, who also attends Eagle Brook. “They are just not for marriage.”

Same-sex marriage was not much of an issue here when Mrs. Bachmann, who declined to be interviewed, arrived at the Statehouse as a new senator in January 2001. Minnesota had already enacted its own version of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which for legal purposes defines marriage as between a man and a woman.

Then, in November 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court declared that state’s law banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Mrs. Bachmann sprang into action.

“She was holding press conferences and saying, ‘We can’t have that in Minnesota,’ ” said Don Betzold, a Democrat and a former chairman of the State Senate Judiciary Committee. She vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment and, seemingly overnight, emerged as Public Enemy No. 1 to Minnesota’s gay rights advocates, who were alarmed by her word choice and her intensity.

“The threat she represented was very real,” said Mr. Dibble, who remembers Mrs. Bachmann “trotting out junk science and debunked claims that being gay is a choice.” During visitor tours of the empty Senate chamber, he said, Mrs. Bachmann would bring people in “to pray around my desk.”

When Out Front Minnesota, a gay rights group, conducted lobbying days at the Statehouse, Mrs. Bachmann made clear she was opposed to its agenda, which included legal recognition of domestic partnerships and nondiscrimination initiatives. Sometimes she would meet gay constituents with guests of her own, said Monica Meyer, the group’s executive director. “She had ex-gay people,” Ms. Meyer said, “who would tell her constituents that being gay was wrong and immoral.”

Inside the Statehouse, some Republicans were uncomfortable.

Stephen E. Dille, a retired Republican state senator who says Mrs. Bachmann was known more for “giving peppy speeches” than getting legislation through, said the marriage amendment was “awkward” for the caucus because one Republican senator was gay. Others saw the issue as a political loser in a state known for tolerance.

But Christian conservatives embraced it — and Mrs. Bachmann.

“She stood up as a Christian,” said Bob Battle, pastor of the Berean Church of God in Christ here. “She made her point of view known, and she gave Christians a voice.”

She proved herself an extraordinary organizer. “The social conservative groups were largely isolated; she went to them and made a very hard-edged argument that their deeply felt values were being ignored,” Professor Jacobs said.

She worked with the Minnesota Family Council, which opposes abortion and gay rights, to plan a series of “Minnesotans for Marriage” rallies at the Capitol. They organized churches to send buses; Mrs. Bachmann promoted the events on Christian talk shows.

“We’re seeing the fulfillment of the Book of Judges here in our own time — every man doing that which is right in his own eyes,” she warned the hosts of one radio show, “Prophetic Views Behind the News.” She went on: “They aren’t interested in being Ward and June Cleaver, that’s not what it’s about. They want legitimization, and they want to force us to shut up about our opposition to the gay lifestyle.”

Her passion proved too much for her stepsister, Helen LaFave, who is openly gay and turned up for a hearing on the bill. “She saw us — you could see the shock on her face,” said Linda Cielinski, another stepsister who was there. “I don’t think she has any idea how badly she’s hurt our side of the family, and I don’t think she cares.”

But Mrs. Bachmann’s brother, Dr. Paul Amble, a psychiatrist in Connecticut, said in a recent interview that his sister was simply doing “what she thought was right,” and meant her stepsiblings no harm.

In the end, the Bachmann amendment faltered. The Minnesota House, controlled by Republicans, adopted it. Mr. Pawlenty made brief appearances at two of the marriage rallies — a nod to how Mrs. Bachmann had managed to elevate the issue. Mrs. Bachmann rose through the ranks to briefly become assistant minority leader, a position she later lost in a dispute with the Republican leadership.

But her bill stalled in the Senate, controlled by Democrats. In 2006, in the waning days of the legislative session — her last in St. Paul — she tried to revive it.

“She brought in a whole bunch of people that were going to be at the Capitol around the clock,” said Mr. Betzold, the former Judiciary Committee chairman. “Kids were sleeping on marble floors, trying to pressure us to bring the bill up in the closing hours.”

Her tenacity earned her a shot at a job in Congress. In 2006, Bachmann loyalists turned out in droves to help her leap over more senior Republicans to grab the party’s nomination for the seat she now holds.

In Washington, Mrs. Bachmann has again found herself at odds with the party establishment, this time as head of the House Tea Party Caucus, which she founded. Some Republicans gritted their teeth when Mrs. Bachmann gave her own televised rebuttal to President Obama’s State of the Union address; the party had picked Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin to give the official response.

Mrs. Bachmann has not been a leader in Washington on same-sex marriage, but has co-sponsored four resolutions opposing it. Here in St. Paul, though, her advocacy seems to have had a lingering effect. A constitutional amendment barring gays from marrying will be on the Minnesota ballot in 2012.
411 2011-07-17 SEVERAL years ago I spent time with a platoon of Army infantry at a remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan, and after the deployment I was surprised that only one of the soldiers chose to leave the military at the end of his contract; many others re-upped and eventually went on to fight for another year in the same area. The soldier who got out, Brendan O’Byrne, remained a good friend of mine as he struggled to fit in to civilian life back home.

About a year later I invited Brendan to a dinner party, and a woman asked him if he missed anything at all about life at the outpost. It was a good question: the platoon had endured a year without Internet, running water or hot food and had been in more combat than almost any platoon in the United States military. By any measure it was hell, but Brendan didn’t hesitate: “Ma’am,” he said, “I miss almost all of it.”

Civilians are often confused, if not appalled, by that answer. The idea that a psychologically healthy person could miss war seems an affront to the idea that war is evil. Combat is supposed to feel bad because undeniably bad things happen in it, but a fully human reaction is far more complex than that. If we civilians don’t understand that complexity, we won’t do a very good job of bringing these people home and making a place for them in our society.

My understanding of that truth came partly from my own time in Afghanistan and partly from my conversations with a Vietnam veteran named Karl Marlantes, who wrote about his experiences in a devastating novel called “Matterhorn.” Some time after I met Karl, a woman asked me why soldiers “compartmentalize” the experience of war, and I answered as I imagined Karl might have: because society does. We avoid any direct look at the reality of war. And both sides of the political spectrum indulge in this; liberals tend to be scandalized that war can be tremendously alluring to young men, and conservatives rarely acknowledge that war kills far more innocent people than guilty ones. Soldiers understand both of these things but don’t know how to talk about them when met with blank stares from friends and family back home.

“For a while I started thinking that God hated me because I had sinned,” Brendan told me after he got back from Afghanistan. “Everyone tells you that you did what you had to do, and I just hate that comment because I didn’t have to do any of it. I didn’t have to join the Army; I didn’t have to become airborne infantry. But I did. And that comment — ‘You did what you had to do’ — just drives me insane. Because is that what God’s going to say — ‘You did what you had to do? Welcome to heaven?’ I don’t think so.”
412 2011-07-17 The writer is president of the American Psychoanalytic Association and a clinical professor of psychiatry at David Geffen School of Medicine, U.C.L.A.

As a professional ethicist, I share Dr. Procci’s concerns about the medical-pharmaceutical complex and how the obsession with ever-greater profits can hinder, not promote, ethically intelligent patient care.

But as someone who has been using antidepressants successfully for many years, I can say from experience that some of that concern is misplaced. My life is richer and infinitely more satisfying because of this medication. I offer my profound gratitude to the dedicated researchers and conscientious clinicians who have made this possible.

Dr. Procci is right that there is a continuing high-stakes battle over the use of psychiatric drugs, but it is more one-sided than he suggests. These drugs are greatly overused, mainly because of the pharmaceutical industry’s influence on the psychiatric profession.

Many have devastating side effects, especially in children and when used long term. Studies generally show that the benefits are small.

Contrary to the arguments of Dr. Kramer, many sound clinical trials have failed to find antidepressants effective at all in mild to moderate depression. Anecdotes of effectiveness are no substitute for clinical trials, since they can’t take into account the placebo effect or how often a drug is ineffective or harmful.

Despite the risks and uncertain benefits, the number of Americans taking psychiatric drugs is soaring, and the heavy reliance on drugs diverts resources from efforts to find better methods of treatment.

Mental illness is a serious problem, but in the absence of sound evidence, we should be skeptical about all treatment claims — particularly those promoted by the pharmaceutical industry.

The writer is a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine. She is the author of two recent articles on psychiatric drugs in The New York Review of Books.

Dr. Procci’s advice is for the depressed patient to identify the ethical caregiver. That is not so simple in a medical care system that denies access, limits complex consultation, and rewards technology and procedures.

Questions about the efficacy of antidepressants are but one chapter in a larger moral and social tale without clear answers. Except perhaps one: The medical system we have today plainly does not work. What to do next is far more challenging than listening to Prozac.

The writer is a clinical professor of psychiatry, University of Washington in Seattle.

I agree with Dr. Procci’s suggestion for the type of doctor whom patients should seek, but good luck finding one who practices this philosophy of treatment and is willing to spend so much time with each patient. They do exist, but they’re few and far between.

Then, try to tell an insurance company that longer sessions are more cost effective in the long run and conducive to overall health than the 15-minute sessions with the script writers who ask how you feel on a 1-to-10 scale, then prescribe accordingly. After that, make up the difference between the insurance company’s paltry “reasonable and customary” fee schedule and the actual fee.

As a practicing psychiatrist, I have found antidepressants to be extremely effective. However, there are two main obstacles to finding an optimal medication regimen for patients: Each patient’s brain circuitry is unique, so what works well for one person may not necessarily do so for another; the severity of mental illness lies on a continuum, influenced by genes, life experiences and personality.

It is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to design a clinical study that can truly take into account all of these differences. Thus, we are left with studies whose results often conflict.

Perhaps in the distant future, we will have a machine that will analyze each patient’s brain and create a customized medication regimen, but until then, clinicians are left with the reality that prescribing medication for depression remains much more of an art than a science.

Without antidepressant drugs, there would be no psychiatry. Psychiatrists for more than 20 years, since serotonin-enhancing drugs were introduced, have, for financial reasons, elected to become psychopharmacologists, and many have given up traditional psychotherapy. Instead, they frequently shunt people who require talking therapy to psychologists.

If as suggested by randomized, controlled studies, the placebo response approaches that of the drugs, the individual psychiatrist really has no way to tell whether patients are better because of the drug or simply because they have been prescribed a drug.

If these drugs were taken away from psychiatrists, or if psychologists could legally prescribe these drugs, psychiatry would perish.

The writer is a clinical associate professor of neurosciences, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

Dr. Procci’s suggestion that people seek help from clinicians who are willing to listen to and work with them is entirely reasonable — as far as it goes. But it does not capture a seismic shift that has been occurring in mental health care.

While the media focus has been on what the professional or the pill is going to do for the suffering person, the emerging recovery movement has made clear what individuals can and must do to help themselves — individually and collectively — and how central self-help and mutual aid are to recovery.

When it comes to dealing with psychiatric challenges, there are no magic doctors or magic pills. There is no effortless recovery.

With this in mind, I would add the following to Dr. Procci’s advice: Seek other people in recovery and recovery-oriented clinicians who can help support you while you learn how to do the work of recovery on your own.

The writer is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.

When my patients respond to treatment for major depression, as a psychiatrist I am often not sure how much it is from the medication and how much from talking to an empathic listener. For depressions accompanied by agitation and psychosis, it is clear that medication, as part of the treatment regimen, is helpful and essential.

The type of provider that Dr. Procci suggests that patients seek should be a psychiatrist (at least for the initial evaluation) who is adept at both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. If the depression is mild, I agree with Dr. Kramer that medication should be used sparingly and as a second line.

The writer is a former president of the New York County Branch of the American Psychiatric Association.

I’m sure psychoanalysis is a good option for some depressives, those who can afford it. But taking a generic form of Celexa for $4 a month gives me a fighting chance to face my demons on my own, with some help from my friends.

I tend to agree with the skeptics who question the efficacy of antidepressants and condemn their prolific use.

Marcia Angell has long highlighted the ways in which the pharmaceutical industry, the psychiatric profession and academia have at times colluded to erode appropriate boundaries.

Another problem is the insurers’ control over access to practitioners and the kind of care they can render.

Kippi Fagerlund poignantly exemplifies how third-party payers relentlessly limit treatment options to those seen as quickly “cost effective,” such as brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapeutic approaches.

Ronnie Stangler rightly sees this as a huge obstacle to quality care. I agree.

The hot crucible of the psychiatrist’s office is far removed from the cool sterility of research labs and academic offices. Patients in real-world settings often do find antidepressants singularly helpful. This doesn’t exonerate the excessive claims of the pharmaceutical industry. It only demonstrates the need for the individual practitioner to maintain his or her focus on the patient’s needs.

The bottom line: We doctors must push our professional organizations to disseminate only the highest quality data, free from conflicts of interest, to assist us in clinical decision making, and we must seek relief from obsessive cost-control management of patient care.

And those suffering from depression should insist on being given access to all available treatments and true information about their efficacy. It is unconscionable for patients to be held hostage to one form of treatment supported by such weak data.
413 2011-07-17 A countervailing surge of support for the article, meanwhile, has come from environment-minded readers. And four Democrats in Congress have called on public agencies to examine some of the issues that Mr. Urbina raised in that story and one the next day.

The reaction underscored the stakes involved in shale gas. Hailed as a cleaner replacement for , it is extracted using a relatively new, water-intensive drilling technique commonly called fracking. As The Times documented in an earlier installment of “Drilling Down,” there is concern that fracking could wreak environmental havoc in shale basins across the country.

I asked Mr. Urbina and his editors to address complaints about the article, starting with the broad objection that it cast doubt on shale gas without mentioning that it had grown rapidly as an energy source — rising from 2 percent of all natural gas production in 2000 to 23 percent 10 years later, which the M.I.T. group called a “paradigm shift.” The journalists said The Times had already cited the big picture of a gas boom in the “Drilling Down” series opener back in February and had thoroughly covered it elsewhere.

I also asked why The Times didn’t include input from the energy giants, like , that have invested billions in natural gas recently. If shale gas is a Ponzi scheme, I wondered, why would the nation’s energy leader jump in?

Mr. Urbina and Adam Bryant, a deputy national editor, said the focus was not on the major companies but on the “independents” that focus on shale gas, because these firms have been the most vocal boosters of shale gas, have benefited most from federal rules changes regarding reserves and are most vulnerable to sharp financial swings. The independents, in industry parlance, are a diverse group that are smaller than major companies like Exxon Mobil and don’t operate major-brand gas stations.

This was lost on many readers, including me. Michael Levi, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote that the article “repeatedly confuses the fortunes of various risk-hungry independents with the fortunes of the industry as a whole.”

He told me he hadn’t realized that the report was focused on independents and read it more broadly, adding, “If I didn’t know they were talking about certain independents, then Times readers — who don’t know what an independent is — they aren’t going to know what they are talking about either.”

This confusion stems from the language in the article, which near the top referred to “natural gas companies” and “energy companies.” The term “independent” appeared only once, inside a quoted e-mail.

The article’s sourcing has also been questioned. The Times presented a large array of e-mails — some recent, some three and four years old — from geologists, analysts, energy executives and others who expressed the belief that companies were exaggerating their prospects. The Times excised the names but not the company affiliations from the e-mails. It was from this trove, which became part of a 487-page online document collection for readers to peruse, that the hot-button references to dot-coms, Ponzi schemes and Enron were pulled for the text of the article.

The two named sources in the story, Art Berman, a geologist from , and Deborah Rogers, a farm owner from , say they provided some of these e-mail conversations.

Mr. Berman, who was described appropriately as “one of the most vocal skeptics of shale gas economics,” told me he had traveled the country giving presentations questioning some companies’ claims for shale gas prospects. It’s clear that some of the e-mails in The Times article came from people who had heard him speak.

Ms. Rogers, a former stockbroker, was described as serving on an advisory group of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. What was not mentioned was that her primary business was a small agricultural operation and that she had clashed with Chesapeake Energy, a leading shale gas producer, over its drilling on land next to hers. Mr. Bryant told me it wasn’t necessary to mention this because the issue had not resulted in litigation and Ms. Rogers was clearly presented as an industry critic.

My view is that such a pointed article needed more convincing substantiation, more space for a reasoned explanation of the other side and more clarity about its focus. The Times journalists countered that their reporting consisted of more than three dozen interviews with industry experts, and analysis of S.E.C. filings from two dozen companies and data from more than 9,000 wells. The Times also published several dozen e-mails from industry officials and federal regulators voicing concerns.

“The article challenges conventional wisdom and a powerful industry, so we expected criticism,” said Richard L. Berke, the national editor. “But it is deeply sourced, meticulously reported and measured, and we would not change a word.”

No question, the article challenged conventional thinking, and perhaps some of the shale gas independents will eventually founder. But the article went out on a limb, lacked an in-depth dissenting view in the text and should have made clear that shale gas had boomed.
414 2011-07-17 After years of trying to stop illegal downloading of music and videos by suing their fans, enticing them to pay through easier formats, and encrypting digital files, the music and movie industries hope they have found an effective approach to fighting copyright theft. This month, several major Internet service providers, including Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Time Warner Cable, agreed to help movie studios and record labels identify Internet users who downloaded copyrighted content illicitly, warn them about the piracy and punish recalcitrant abusers.

Under the agreement, the Internet providers would send up to four warning letters to owners of accounts suspected of pirating content. If illegal downloads continued, the I.S.P.’s could take a range of punitive measures — redirecting users to a landing page with material on copyright abuse, throttling their Internet speeds, possibly cutting their broadband connections.

The strategy is an attempt to deal with a problem that robs billions from music and movie businesses. Frontier Economics, a European consulting firm, estimated that $27 billion to $56 billion worth of music and movies were downloaded illegally worldwide last year. The lobbying group for record labels says four out of five music downloads in the United States are illegal. Since 1999, legal music sales in this country have dropped by 55 percent, to $6.8 billion last year.

The agreement has troubling elements. Internet providers could, at their discretion, cut an infringing user’s connection without a court order. But they can do that now for any user who violates the terms of service. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires providers to send a warning notice to infringing users if copyright holders ask them to. And providers must have a “termination policy” to cut off service to repeat offenders. Customers who receive the new warnings from the I.S.P.’s will be able to challenge the complaint.

Internet providers have always tried to avoid policing copyrights in this way because they are reluctant to terminate paying customers. Their entry into the media business gives them a compelling reason to act against infringers (Comcast bought NBC; Verizon and AT&T have movie delivery services). But the parties to the agreement underscored that shutting down a connection is not required.

The intent of the agreement is to give copyright owners a more subtle weapon against pirates. The recording industry already tried tougher legal tactics. From 2003 to 2008 it sued thousands of file-swappers, demanding substantial damages from individuals in years of litigation.

But it was spending much more on lawyers than it was able to collect. Piracy continued apace. And it was a public relations disaster. In 2009, the industry abandoned that strategy. Now it hopes that the irritant of multiple warnings and the threat of an Internet slowdown will compel users to stop illegal downloading.
415 2011-07-17 TORONTO — The Yankees have their flaws, as the first two games of a series here against the Blue Jays showed, but on days when C. C. Sabathia pitches, none of them seem to matter. Let others fret about an understaffed bullpen, a wobbly third baseman or an unsteady rotation. With Sabathia on the mound, the Yankees do not worry. They just watch, marvel and win.

“When you expect a guy to throw a shutout every time out there, it’s impressive,” Mark Teixeira said after Sabathia lifted the Yankees to a 4-1 victory Saturday.

Sabathia had not allowed a run in three weeks, since June 25, before his career-best scoreless streak ended Saturday at 232/3 innings with one out in the first. He immediately began a new one, from there allowing five base runners — on two walks, two hits and an error — before being removed after eight innings and 110 pitches. Sabathia won his seventh consecutive start, and he usually improves in the second half of the season: in 46 starts after the All-Star break since 2008, Sabathia is 30-8 with a 2.47 earned run average.

“Maybe that’s what makes him so good,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “He doesn’t put too much pressure on himself and just realizes that it’s just one start, and he can only go out and do what he’s going to do.”

The Blue Jays, who were missing the injured Jose Bautista for the second straight game, had battered the Yankees by a combined 23-8 score in winning the first two games, but they looked feeble against Sabathia (14-4), who struck out eight in lowering his E.R.A. to 2.64. He stifled the Blue Jays with a deadly slider and located his fastball better after correcting a mechanical flaw in the second inning. Larry Rothschild, the pitching coach, noticed that Sabathia was not hesitating long enough toward the end of his delivery, affecting his balance.

“Everything was pretty bad,” Sabathia said, and then it wasn’t.

“It’s easier to do the older you get,” Sabathia said. “I think if I was a younger guy, sometimes it’s tough. I’ve been there. I’m able to go out and correct things as the game goes on.”
416 2011-07-17 Anybody can ask me questions and debate me. You could be a new employee and you can start getting into a debate with me about something. The start-up culture is very democratic in general. I think you need that in order to attract good people. You’ve really got to create a company culture that people want to work at. And so you try to give them a voice, give them a sense that they influence the direction of the company, and try to avoid unnecessary process and hierarchy — things that might frustrate employees.

Q. A lot of people say they have an open-door policy, but they don’t really mean it.

A. I think you’ve got to create a culture in which dissent is valued. And there’s probably a lot of ways to set that tone. Certainly you can tell if you’ve got a culture of dissent when you walk into a company. People can figure out very quickly whether dissent is encouraged or whether it’s actually something that’s not welcome.

A. It’s a red flag to me if there’s just too much consensus and not enough dissent. I feel like in any human community there’s always dissent because people just disagree. Anytime there doesn’t appear to be dissent, it means that the corporate culture has just shifted way too much toward consensus. That means the leadership just doesn’t welcome dissent enough.

Q. So how do you create a culture of dissent?

A. You’ve got to constantly ask your reports whether they think we’re on the right track, whether the strategy you’ve laid out is right, what they think about the strategy, where things aren’t going well. You’ve really got to dig into that.

We let employees voice their opinions about everything. There’s no sense that, O.K., I am an engineer, therefore I can’t voice my opinion about what’s happening in customer service or sales or vice versa. We try to create clear ownership so everyone owns an area. But that doesn’t mean that people from other parts of the company can’t voice their opinion about something that’s happening there. And it may not just be about a dissenting opinion. It may just be to provide more information. It doesn’t have to be, “I don’t like what you’re doing.” It’s more like, “Here’s a bunch of things I’m learning over here — are you guys taking this into account?”

Q. It’s very easy, though, for people to get their back up and say, in so many words, get out of my sandbox.

A. And that’s why you have to have clear ownership. One of the ways political cultures develop is when it’s not clear enough who owns which areas, and so you need to get lots of people on board to do something. That’s not true at our company. One reason people can feel comfortable about dissent here is because their own responsibilities are clear.

And one thing we try to do is define everybody’s role in the company so that, in a sense, they have a territory. They have a sphere within which they can make decisions as opposed to a committee-based or team-based approach where there’s a bunch of people who kind of share the decision. So the first step is to have clearer lines of responsibility. One of the things I spend a lot of time doing, as we create new teams, is to look at the boundaries between these teams to make sure they are clear enough. Do they make sense? Do people have clear enough objectives?

Once you have that and each person knows their area, you have the vertical part. Then you can start working on the horizontal part. And the horizontal part is we want information in the organization to be as transparent as possible. We want everyone sharing as much as possible because it helps everyone else do their job. And I think people want to take this information into account. In a well-functioning company, they don’t go, “Oh, this information didn’t come through my channel so I’m not going to listen to it.” They really do want the information, so we try to encourage a culture of knowledge-sharing. The most valuable employees in the company are the ones who can share the most useful information.

Q. What else is unusual about your culture?

A. We do a lot of things to try and pull the company together and make sure that we’re all on the same page. So about once a quarter, I give a company presentation that lays out our thinking at a high level about the strategy. And then once a month we have Yammer Time at the end of the day on Friday, and the executive team takes questions from anyone in the company. They can also submit them online. They can also submit them anonymously if they want. We’ll basically answer anything that people want. People can see the anonymous questions online, and people can vote on which questions they want us to answer.

Q. Let’s talk about hiring. How do you do it?

A. We tend to involve a lot of people in the hiring process. You’ll probably interview with about half a dozen people at Yammer who are mostly on the team that you’re on, but it can also involve some people who would not be on your team. And so the hiring is somewhat democratic. The employees have a voice in who gets hired. And that means when somebody starts that they’ve got the support of at least half a dozen peers, as well as the manager.

I would say that one bias that I have is, given a choice between someone with experience in a given area, and someone who appears to be a really good problem solver, I’m willing to bet on the problem solver. What I found with both PayPal and Yammer is that we’re solving a lot of new problems. By definition, if you’re a start-up, you have to solve problems that have never been solved before — otherwise you’re not creating a new business model.

And so experience can be overrated in hiring. It’s much more important to hire somebody who is going to be able to solve a problem in a new way, and who is creative about decision-making. That’s very hard to interview for or test for. But we try to hire people like that if we can.

Q. If you were interviewing me, how would you figure out whether I’m a good problem solver?

A. I’d find out a little bit about what you’ve done in the past. Have you done entrepreneurial things? I would start talking to you about our business and how you view it and what you think about it. What do you like? What do you think doesn’t work? We might just start drilling into an aspect of our business and talk about that. I actually like people who are kind of opinionated about our business. They don’t necessarily have all the information yet, but it’s good when they come in with some point of view on what we’re doing.

Q. And besides problem solving, are there other intangible qualities are you looking for?

A. If we are hiring someone for a management position, they can’t be too hierarchical. They’ve got to be prepared for the fact that people don’t perceive legitimacy from rank. They perceive legitimacy from how good you are. The way you have to persuade people as a manager is you can’t really appeal to your rank or authority. You’ve got to be able to persuade people based on rational argument. That can be an adjustment for some managers who are not used to having to defend their positions, rather than just saying, we’re doing this because I’m saying we’re doing this.

Q. What else is unusual about your company?

A. We just implemented this quarterly process called Morph. So Morph stands for Mission, Objectives, Results, People, and the H is for “How,” as in, “How did you do by the end of the quarter?”

Q. Break that down for me further.

A. Mission is just a one-sentence description of what’s your mission at the company? What do you have ownership of? And that really gets people to think about, O.K., what is my overall mission here?

Objectives are the top three, maximum five, things that you want to achieve this quarter. Results are about the metrics you’re going to use to measure those objectives. How do we know if we’ve achieved them? People refers to, what changes do we need to make in the organization to achieve this? Do we need to hire people? Do we need to create new teams? Do we need to change the way that a team is defined? And then at the end of the quarter we just ask, “How’d you do?”

So I do this first. Then I present it to my direct reports. Then they present theirs to their reports. And it’s supposed to be pushed all the way down through the organization. So it’s an exercise in alignment. And this is all something that fits on one page. I feel like if you can’t get this down to one page, then it doesn’t work. It’s called Morph because I worked out the letters to try be a synonym for change. Because I want to convey to people that management isn’t about keeping a lid on things. It’s about progressing, changing things.

We’re constantly adjusting what the objectives are, what the goals are, maybe the metrics. So by the end of the quarter the Morph might have changed and the new Morph hopefully won’t be this complete exercise out of the blue. It’ll just be a continuation of what we’re already doing. But I think it is helpful just to pause once a quarter and just kind of step back for a second and say, “What are we trying to do here?” You have to be centralized with respect to direction, decentralized with respect to execution.
417 2011-07-17 ISTANBUL — In a series of pointed statements, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Turkey, a close NATO ally, on Saturday, for its mixed record on press and other freedoms.

The United States has long counted on Turkey, a moderate Muslim nation, to serve as a bridge between Muslim and Western nations, and Mrs. Clinton couched her criticism by suggesting that it was crucial that Turkey continued to modernize at a time when countries throughout the region were in revolt and searching for models for democratic change.

“People in the Middle East and North Africa are seeking to draw lessons from Turkey’s experience,” she said at a news conference with Turkey’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. “Turkey’s history serves as a reminder that democratic development also depends on responsible leadership.”

In an earlier town hall event at which local reporters were excluded, Mrs. Clinton mentioned the continued detentions of scores of journalists and what she called “restrictions” on freedom of religion, according to The Associated Press. As she has before, she prodded leaders to reopen a long-closed Christian seminary. Although Turkey recognizes religions other than Islam, critics say the government could do more to embrace religious minorities, including Alawites.

The United States’ relationship with Turkey is a complicated one. Turkey has become a far more liberal country in recent years, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is praised by many for not letting his own deep religious beliefs erode the country’s secular traditions. But debate has intensified about whether Turkey has tilted east. The country has also taken a more assertive stance in the region as it senses a decline in American influence there.

In a sign of the conflicted relationship, Mrs. Clinton made a point on Saturday of thanking the Turkish authorities for their recent detention of more than a dozen suspected militants of Al Qaeda who are accused of planning to attack the United States Embassy in Turkey. But she also was unsparing in her assessment of Turkey, in particular of journalists’ detentions.
418 2011-07-17 The cheerful, childlike doggerel of “Hello Goodbye” — ”I don’t know why you say goodbye/I say hello” — struck an unexpected note as Paul McCartney sang it on Friday night to start his two-night stand at Yankee Stadium. “Who is this Derek Jeter guy?” Mr. McCartney asked. “Somebody said he’s got more hits than me.”

At 69, Mr. McCartney is not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts. Friday’s set ran two and a half hours, with Mr. McCartney constantly onstage, and it had 35 songs, not counting a few additional excerpts. He played half a dozen instruments (though he didn’t show off his drumming), sang with only a few scrapes in the voice that’s familiar worldwide, and looked as if he was having a boyish romp as he navigated what endure as some of rock’s oddest hits. His hair grew more tousled with every song.

The set drew on Mr. McCartney’s various outlets from the 1960s on: the Beatles, Wings, his solo albums and his once-pseudonymous project the Fireman.

His concerts now are a gentle reminder of his survival and vitality. He paid tribute to John Lennon — with a lovely, imagined afterlife conversation, “Here Today” — and to George Harrison, starting Harrison’s “Something” by playing it on a ukulele Mr. Harrison gave him. The exultant “Back in the U.S.S.R.” has outlasted not only the corporate name B.O.A.C., the airline mentioned in the lyrics, but the Soviet Union as well.

As always, melody let Mr. McCartney put across musical and verbal non sequiturs few other songwriters could get away with: songs like “Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five,” with its sudden interlude of Beach Boys harmony, or “Let ’Em In,” which switches from piano bounce to military tattoo, with whistling, and has lyrics that juxtapose Martin Luther and Phil and Don. (The Everly Brothers?) Melody easily carried Mr. McCartney through idiom after idiom: toe-tapping country in “I’ve Just Seen a Face,” hard rock in “Helter Skelter,” lilting ballad in “I Will,” something like ska in “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” and the quasi-Slavic oompah in “Mrs. Vandebilt.” (Mr. McCartney announced that they loved it in Ukraine.)

There was more than a little familiarity to the concert for anyone who attended Mr. McCartney’s 2009 shows at that other new ballpark, the Mets’ Citi Field, or listened to and watched the resulting live album of CDs and a DVD, “Good Evening New York City” (Hear Music). Once again he wore suspenders over his white shirt. His band lineup hasn’t changed, with Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums, Brian Ray and Rusty Anderson on guitars and Paul (Wix) Wickens on keyboards. Two-thirds of the songs were the same, often in similar groupings and with the same arrangements and first-time surprises, like appending Jimi Hendrix’s “Foxy Lady” to “Let Me Roll It,” or segueing “A Day in the Life” into “Give Peace a Chance” — a V-sign waving epiphany for the crowd — or explaining that the civil-rights movement inspired “Blackbird.”
419 2011-07-17 AMERICANS would sooner watch a spelling bee than a cricket match. No, really: ESPN’s broadcast of the Scripps National Spelling Bee draws an average of four million viewers, while the network’s online coverage of 2011 World Cup Cricket generated some 1.3 million hits here. So what does that bode for a politics-ridden documentary about a cricket team — from the West Indies, no less, a part of the world that most Americans associate with piña coladas, not postcolonial politics?

Such is the question facing “Fire in Babylon,” which opens in New York Friday. A story of the undefeated West Indies cricket team during the turbulent ’70s and ’80s — the era of Bob Marley, anti-Apartheid movements and London race riots — the film garnered rave reviews in Britain, where a review in The Telegraph called it “joyous and uplifting,” and the premiere was attended by Jude Law and Mick Jagger. But while the director, Stevan Riley, said he aimed to tell “an accessible story for everyone, not just fans of the sport,” he also had much more in mind, delving into complex issues, though not always to the satisfaction of those close to the subject.

“It was very important to recognize that this story went beyond cricket,” said Mr. Riley, who also directed “Blue Blood” (2007), about the boxing rivalry between Oxford and Cambridge. “Cricket is a vehicle for telling a much deeper tale about realization of identity and freedom, and black pride and struggle.”

That tale starts in the 1960s, with cricket beloved throughout the Caribbean. The sport has a rich history in the former British empire. It was initially limited to white colonizers — 19th-century cricket clubs were essentially part of the vaccine against good English stock “degenerating” in the colonies — then becoming popular among the colonized too.

For them donning cricket whites had symbolic import: it meant imitating the master, imbibing his social norms and etiquette, which early cricket manuals dispensed alongside rules of the game. Cricket was the ultimate colonial “civilizer,” a notion aptly captured in Joseph O’Neill’s best-selling 2008 novel “Netherland,” about cricket culture in New York. “People, all people, Americans, whoever, are at their most civilized when they’re playing cricket,” the novel’s Trinidadian protagonist muses. “What’s the first thing that happens when Pakistan and India make peace? They play a cricket match.”

As the film shows, the ’60s-era Windies team was impressive; it just had one problem. “We would be very spectacular,” one team member, Colin Croft, said by phone from Trinidad. “We would be flashy and bouncy and athletically superior — but we’d lose.” This was part of their appeal. Derided as “calypso cricketers,” the Windies were like fire eaters at an all-inclusive resort: designed for the amusement of foreign patrons.
420 2011-07-17 Melissa Sari Wilder and Alexander J. Levine were married Saturday evening at the Fresh Meadow Country Club in Great Neck, N.Y. Rabbi Steven Blane officiated.

The couple, both 28, met at the University of Michigan, from which they graduated.

Mrs. Levine is a vice president in the finance unit of Citigroup in New York, where she is responsible for forecasting and analyzing financial projections for the institutional clients group. She is the daughter of Dierdre S. Wilder and Robert S. Wilder of Plainview, N.Y.

Mr. Levine is a vice president for leasing and development at the Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, a real estate investment and development concern in New York. He is the son of Janie S. Levine and Marvin J. Levine, both of New York.
421 2011-07-17 Emily Ilene Smolar and Matthew Thomas Anziano were married Saturday at Beckwith Pointe, a club in New Rochelle, N.Y., by Rabbi Paul Swerdlow.

The bride, 33, who will continue to use her name professionally, is a producer for “On the Case With Paula Zahn,” a program on the Investigation Discovery network.

The bride graduated from Syracuse University. She is a daughter of Rochelle Smolar and Martin B. Smolar of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

The bridegroom, 30, is a freelance cameraman and video editor. He works for FiOS1 News, the Verizon local news channel that is shown in New Jersey and on Long Island. He graduated from Hofstra.

422 2011-07-17 James B. Stewart dedicates his new book “to all who seek the truth.” But in his view, the ranks of committed truth-seekers are shrinking before our eyes. “Mounting evidence suggests that the broad public commitment to telling the truth under oath has been breaking down, eroding over recent decades, a trend that has been accelerating in recent years,” he declares. “Perjury has infected nearly every aspect of society.”

What is Stewart’s “mounting evidence” that perjury is on the rise and “false statements are undermining America”? He concedes that “it’s impossible to know for certain” whether lying is “worse now than in previous decades,” but he emphasizes that “prosecutors have told me repeatedly that a surge of concerted, deliberate ­lying” by white-collar criminals “threatens to swamp the legal system.” There is simply too much lying, he laments, and “too little is prosecuted to generate any meaningful statistics,” in contrast to other serious crimes, like murder. “We know how many murders are committed each year — 1,318,398 in 2009,” he writes in the first sentence of “Tangled Webs.”

At this point, if I were caught up in Stewart’s prosecutorial spirit, I might object that the first sentence of his book is a lie. In fact, according to the F.B.I.’s statistics, an estimated 1,318,398 violent crimes, not murders, were committed in the United States in 2009. And a vast majority of these violent crimes didn’t involve murder; they involved robbery and aggravated assault. But of course, it would be hyperbolic and unfair of me to accuse Stewart of lying without knowing more about the motive behind his false statement. Perhaps it was an inadvertent error, in which case calling it a lie seems much too strong. On the other hand, perhaps it was a deliberate misrepresentation devised to create a more dramatic opening — perhaps, in other words, he felt that comparing lying to robbery would be less vivid than comparing lying to murder. Deliberate misrepresentation seems highly unlikely for a Pulitzer Prize-­winning journalist of his caliber, but without knowing more about his motives, I can’t make a fair-minded judgment about how seriously to treat his false statement.

Unlike Stewart, the Anglo-American legal system has long been sensitive to these fine distinctions. It has treated some lies more seriously than others, depending on the intent of the speaker and the effect on other people. It’s true, as Stewart notes, that perjury was dealt with severely in 16th-century England. (“The offender was typically punished by cutting out his tongue,” he observes wistfully.) But he doesn’t note that English and American courts were so concerned about the human instinct to tell self-protective lies that they avoided putting defendants in situations in which they might be tempted to commit perjury. Until the late 19th century, American courts never examined defendants under oath, considering it a form of moral torture to force people to choose among self-incrimination, contempt of court and perjury, along with the eternal damnation they believed was the real punishment for betraying an oath to God.

Although Stewart, now a business columnist for The New York Times, claims that lying has been on the rise, a more plausible thesis is that prosecutions for false statements have been rising — not because of growing contempt for the truth but because defendants are increasingly prosecuted for doing nothing more than denying their guilt to investigators. (These are the kinds of lies that courts used to excuse under a doctrine called the exculpatory no.) It wasn’t until the post-Watergate era that prosecutors began routinely to indict people not merely for lying under oath but for lying to federal officials even when not under oath — using a novel law that is the basis for several of the prosecutions Stewart celebrates.
423 2011-07-17 BUILDING a portfolio of vintage cars can put a collector in the same situation as a dog that chases cars: what do you do once you’ve accomplished your goal?

With business interests to look after, Dennis Albaugh has little time to exercise all the prizes in his cache of nearly 150 Chevys. Part of his solution for giving it a purpose has been to do good in his community of Ankeny, Iowa.

On July 23, the garage will open for the day as a fund-raiser for the local high school. Visitors can enjoy viewing the collection; owners of collectible vehicles can enter a judged show. Parking for show entries will be provided on the golf course on the property.

This year’s fund-raising goal at the Albaugh Classic is $75,000, according to Brenda Colby, the principal of Ankeny High School. The last time the event was held, in 2009, it drew 4,200 visitors and raised $60,000 for the school.

“It’s a pretty nice little lump sum that we get at the end of the day,” Ms. Colby said. “It allows us to do extra things that we might not otherwise be able to do.”
424 2011-07-17 The job of House Republican majority whip — which is to gather sufficient votes to pass the party’s agenda on the House floor — would seem, at first blush, inappropriate for someone who is approximately as menacing as a summer-camp counselor. The word “whip” implies coercion and brings to mind the dark, backroom persuasions of , known as the Hammer (who, truthfully, was never that much of a knuckle-breaker, though apparently he loved having that reputation). In the end, there’s only so much control House leaders can exert over a congressman who answers to voters back home. Whips tend to recognize this and, at least in recent years, have relied more on cajoling than threats. McCarthy, who is 46, represents the affable extreme of this philosophy. In his sunny view, “A conference united around policies creates better legislation than using intimidation.”

Actually achieving that sort of unity is easier said than done — and particularly so because of the House majority’s freshman class. The 87 new members constitute more than a third of the 239-member Republican caucus and are the reason that the G.O.P. now controls the House. Nearly 40 percent of them are self-styled “citizen politicians” who have never held office and who rode into Washington on the Tea Party wave. Taken as a group, the freshmen are at least as conservative as the foot soldiers of ’s 1994 Republican revolution, a 73-member mixed bag that would eventually produce eight U.S. senators, one TV star ( ), one felon ( ) and one correctional officer (Jim Bunn). The difference is that the class of 1994 was thoroughly beholden (for a couple of years, anyway) to Gingrich, while this year’s group harbors no particular allegiance either to Boehner or to the well-being of the Republican Party. As Tim Griffin, a freshman from , put it to me, “A lot of us feel that we’re here on a mission, and the mission is now, and we’re not that concerned about the political consequences.” That mission — to throttle the role of the federal government in general and Obama’s progressive initiatives specifically — may seem more like a kamikaze pursuit to some of the freshmen as the 2012 elections get closer and their constituents become increasingly impatient for government solutions. For now, however, they and their Tea Party backers constitute the most formidable power bloc on Capitol Hill.

Boehner has responded to these realities with the laissez-faire mantra “Let the House work its will.” But neither he nor Cantor (who clearly intends to occupy Boehner’s post someday) nor the caucus’s comparatively moderate senior members want to see the G.O.P. freshmen vote the party over a cliff. And so to hold the caucus together, McCarthy’s delicate approach has been to acknowledge the independence of the hot-blooded new charges while instilling in them a sense of team loyalty — and thereby moving them, ever so gently, to a victory that will be enduring rather than Pyrrhic.

“Kevin probably has a better handle on the freshmen than anybody else here,” Boehner told me. It’s an unlikely bond that McCarthy has forged with the new arrivals. His own rise to power was enabled by years of grooming in Bakersfield by his mentor, the former House Ways and Means Committee chairman , whose retirement allowed his ambitious young aide to claim his seat. Once in Washington, McCarthy networked and fund-raised his way up the food chain, and in four short years became the third-ranking House Republican. His ascent, in other words, involves the very type of Beltway scheming that the class of 2010 plainly abhors. McCarthy has only attended one Tea Party rally — in Bakersfield, with Boehner in tow, though neither of them spoke at the event — and as a congressman has certainly been willing to turn the federal spigots to assist his farming constituents in the San Joaquin Valley. When I asked Duffy if he had a sense of where McCarthy lay on the ideological spectrum, he said, “That’s a good question,” adding, “the ideas that are coming to the conference — he believes in them. You can’t talk so passionately and . . . I mean, Kevin lives in , but he’s not an actor.”

McCarthy is a man of indistinct calculations — “I don’t think being a congressman is going to define me,” he says cryptically — but he has won over the freshmen by making his own goals and beliefs beside the point. He recruited many of them, anointed them Young Guns and nurtured them during the 2010 midterm election cycle. Rather than being pawns in some kind of Karl Roveian überstrategy to achieve lasting Republican pre-­eminence, the freshmen represent McCarthy’s more entrepreneurial approach to politics: seize upon a trend (in this case, government ), put all your money on it and then work hard to make the trend last. And like an entrepreneur, he casts the considerable strategic risk — that his troops are unseasoned, volatile and perhaps far out of the mainstream — as a virtue: “I believe we’re serving in a different time and place. Unconventional is positive. Unconventional gets rewarded.”

Sometimes late at night, the freshmen will drop by McCarthy’s other office, the one reserved for the majority whip behind a door marked H-107 on the first floor of the Capitol. The whip’s office is the unofficial retreat for the House Republicans — but particularly for the freshmen, 19 of whom bunk in their own offices across the street. Ostensibly, they amble into H-107 to filch one of McCarthy’s granola bars or to get some information on a pending legislative matter. The likelier reason is to relieve boredom or loneliness or the desire to duck out of sight for a while. At times the corporate-­flophouse panorama resembles an airport frequent-flier lounge, complete with beer and wine. “This is what I want,” McCarthy told me. “I want them living in this office.” More to the point, he wants them to feel a connection to what his office and the Republican leadership are up to. The walls of H-107 subliminally reinforce this sense of belonging, covered as they are with framed images of freshmen alongside senior members, all in black and white like statesmen from some nobler era.

McCarthy suspects that he has an addictive personality, and it’s probably for the better that he shuns caffeine. Still, the substance he craves is human interaction. He never sits alone in his whip’s office with the door closed so as to summon thoughts or shut out the world. He never eats alone. If invited to a social function, he never fails to drag along at least one colleague. The floor of the House is his neighborhood bar: he sits down to chat with the freshmen women, then jumps into the aisle to receive Duffy’s volley of rabbit punches, then collars the liberal Democrat to compliment him on his appearance on “The Colbert Report.” (“I didn’t know you were a ventriloquist! Pretty cool!”) Bill Thomas, McCarthy’s mentor, spent many hours talking with McCarthy about the code. But, Thomas says, “he was more interested in people — that was his forte, you could say.”

Routinely, during the day, McCarthy gathers some of his Republican colleagues in the conference room of H-107 to decide how they’re going to save America. In previous months, these “listening sessions,” as McCarthy calls them, focused on the Republican budget legislation written by and taken to the House floor in April. The initiative would shrink the percentage of federal nonsecurity discretionary spending (relative to ) to pre-Great Depression levels, convert to a sort of voucher system, shift more of the cost of to states and preserve the for wealthy Americans. Several of the more senior members worried that the Medicare provision in particular was going too far. (McCarthy’s chief deputy whip, Peter Roskam, says, “One of them said, ‘It’s been great serving with you — I’m going to be a former member of Congress.’ ”) The freshmen overwhelmingly supported what Ryan was up to — to the extent that McCarthy and the House Budget Committee chairman would murmur to each other: “Wow. We can go further on entitlements. If we don’t, these guys probably won’t even support the bill.”

In the end, all but four Republicans voted for the Ryan budget plan. Immediately after the vote on April 15, Ryan sought out the whip on the House floor, shook his hand and told him, “Your listening sessions made the difference.” But a month later, a reliably Republican seat in the 26th District of New York fell in a special election to , a Democrat who campaigned relentlessly on her opponent’s support of the Ryan plan. Exultant Democrats (and some moderate Republicans) think that the House conservatives disastrously overreached and that the 2012 election will now be about — as brazenly put it a few of weeks ago — “Medicare, Medicare and Medicare.” The Republican leadership sees it differently. A recent Bloomberg poll shows that a majority of Americans support cutting government spending and taxes. (The same poll indicates that far more Americans fear a full Republican takeover than a second Obama term.) With few exceptions, the freshmen have shown surprising poise and resolve after encountering anti-Republican “Mediscare” activism at their town-hall meetings. It’s for this reason that McCarthy believes the public will ultimately reward his party’s show of political fortitude. “We put our ideas out there,” he says. “They haven’t. That gives us protection.”

Of course, the current topic in H-107 has been the , the legal limit that the federal government is authorized to borrow, and which Congress has raised largely without incident 10 times in the past decade alone. Secretary has said that the government will be unable to meet its financial obligations by Aug. 2 unless Congress permits it to borrow more. The freshmen have not been shy on this subject, either. McCarthy informally polled them when they first came to town in November for orientation. All but four of them said they would vote against raising the ceiling, under any circumstances. Then McCarthy (along with Ryan and the House Ways and Means chairman, ) began conducting more listening sessions. The whip recognized that it would be counterproductive to lecture the freshmen about the economic hazards of not raising the debt ceiling. He also realized that it’s one thing to pass a budget — which in the end is a nonbinding political document — and another thing to throw America into default. And so McCarthy has urged them to consider raising the ceiling under certain conditions and thus to view this moment as a golden opportunity to force significant changes from the White House. “We all ran for a reason,” he tells them. “What’s most of concern to you? What is it that we think will change America?”

As a result, the freshmen have begun to move away from a hard “no” on raising the debt ceiling to a “yes, if.” In the conference room, several freshmen have said they’ll vote to raise the ceiling only if the president agrees to repeal his health care legislation. Or if Obama signs into law a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, after all 50 states have ratified it. Or if he’ll agree to mandatory caps on all nondefense spending. Or if he’ll enact the Ryan budget. The whip writes down all their ideas on a notepad. He never tells them that they’re being unrealistic — that two-thirds of the Senate and three-fourths of the state Legislatures are unlikely to pass a balanced-budget amendment. McCarthy’s indulgence of their ideas isn’t just a patronizing gesture, however. Already in the budget talks supervised by Vice President , the Democrats have signaled that they’ll agree to deep cuts and possible entitlement reforms — the kinds of concessions they would never have made on their own. By staking out a position far to the right, the House Republicans are tugging the White House and the Senate much farther in their direction than almost any Washington insider would have predicted. They’re winning, in other words. The question is whether McCarthy can convince the freshmen and their Tea Party benefactors to see it that way.

McCarthy’s tenacious optimism has been crucial to his party’s resurgence. On the night of Obama’s in 2009, he told beleaguered Republicans over dinner: “Let’s not act like the minority. Let’s challenge them on every single bill and on every single campaign — and let’s do it right away.” Before some of the newly elected Democrats could get comfortable, McCarthy began raising money to run attack ads in their districts. Later he oversaw the drafting of the Pledge to America, which became the de facto Republican campaign script for 2010. McCarthy’s gift for salesmanship proved decisive when Boehner appointed him the party’s chief recruiter for the midterm elections. Sean Duffy spoke with McCarthy constantly throughout the campaign. So did a farmer named Kristi Noem — though she received what she calls “good messaging advice” covertly, as Noem’s entire campaign was based on her wholesale rejection of Beltway orthodoxy. McCarthy’s signature discovery was a folksy but canny cotton farmer and gospel singer from Frog Jump, Tenn., named Stephen Fincher who had never run for elective office but who would later acknowledge to me, with pitch-perfect understatement, that he “was blessed with the ability to raise money.”

McCarthy also went to work on another recruit, a bald physician named Scott DesJarlais, and instructed him to shave his goatee. DesJarlais wanted to know why that was so important. “ shaves his entire body to gain one-tenth of one second,” McCarthy replied. “I think that goatee is costing you 5 percent of the vote.” The next time the men encountered each other, DesJarlais had shaved, and McCarthy decided he was serious.

Today the whiskerless doctor who campaigned against Obama’s “socialist” agenda and “the destructive consequences of unnecessary government meddling” is a congressman. Barely three months into his tenure, DesJarlais found himself signing a joint letter to to request “crucial” federal assistance for flood victims in his district. McCarthy’s whip office helped throw together a manual for DesJarlais and other freshmen representing disaster-stricken districts. The document, which includes contact information for and other federal agencies, implicitly strikes a note of caution: the government you bashed in 2010 is the government you may need in 2011.

One of the first freshmen to encounter a natural disaster was Renee Ellmers, a former intensive-care nurse. The congresswoman texted McCarthy on the afternoon of Saturday, April 16, to inform him that she wouldn’t be able to make it back to Washington the next morning to be on ABC’s “This Week With ” with a panel of freshmen because a had struck in Wake County. While Ellmers tended to victims at a Red Cross shelter late that evening, McCarthy suggested to her that she have ABC send a satellite crew to her in North Carolina instead.

Ellmers is one of the handful of freshmen whom McCarthy and the National Republican Congressional Committee didn’t recruit and didn’t assist but who won anyway — a fact she says she has since reminded him of “numerous times.” McCarthy, who can’t stand the sight of blood, appreciates the ex-nurse’s toughness. Ellmers is one of nine women in this high- freshman class and has to find her own way of being heard. She barraged McCarthy with e-mails and phone calls saying she saw little sense in the G.O.P. leadership’s decision in June to send the White House a message by bringing to the floor a “clean” (or condition-free) debt ceiling and then resoundingly voting it down. Sometimes when Ellmers is talking to the whip and doesn’t think she’s getting through to him, she claps her hands loudly in front of his face. Sometimes McCarthy giggles and claps back.

In contrast to Ellmers, Jon Runyan, of , an immense former offensive lineman, is shy and ideologically temperate. One night, while hosting a dinner with several freshmen at an Italian restaurant on Capitol Hill, McCarthy sat next to Runyan and got him to open up. Runyan had been noticing how certain G.O.P. cable-TV perennials were bashing Boehner for negotiating with the White House and the Democratic Senate to avoid a government shutdown during the springtime budget battles. It was hard enough for Runyan and other freshmen to support the leadership without their own colleagues stirring ill feelings. “You know, when I was playing for the , we didn’t start losing ’til joined the team,” he told McCarthy. “It only takes one guy to bring down a locker room.”

“You’ve got to tell that story to the conference tomorrow morning,” McCarthy urged him. Runyan did, and after he was finished, — who was guilty of the very infraction that Runyan was referring to — went up to the microphone to praise his speech.

Where McCarthy has prodded Runyan to speak up, he has cautioned Michael Grimm to exercise more restraint. Grimm is a natty former undercover special agent — the mobsters he infiltrated dubbed him Mikey Suits — who shares his Congressional office with a Yorkshire Terrier named Sebastian and as a result has needlelike teeth marks all over his hands. Grimm won election to his and seat with significant Tea Party support. But some of his stands, like defending the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, have infuriated the right, and when the Heritage Action group gave him a low score, Grimm says he got angry. “I said, ‘Kevin, who’s our contact at Heritage Action, because I’m gonna call them.’ ” The pugnacious freshman later went on Fox to denounce the “extremists” in his party. “Within the conference, a lot of people came up to me and said, ‘Thanks for having the guts to say that,’ ” he says. Other colleagues, however, think Grimm’s outburst amounted to self-immolation. McCarthy has warned him: “Don’t do press for press’s sake. They’ll bring you up, and they’ll also bring you down.”

McCarthy nonetheless sees value in Grimm’s zealousness — “I’ll bet that guy eats an passionately” — and has deputized Grimm to keep tabs on the voting inclinations of a handful of other freshmen. Grimm was hesitant to join the whip team. “If there’s something I think is going to hurt my district or my country — whip team or no, I’m gonna vote my conscience,” Grimm says he told McCarthy. “I know as a whip you need to rely on me for certain votes. And I don’t know that I’ll be able to do that for you.”

“That’s not what our whipping is going to be about,” McCarthy responded, according to both men. “It’s not going to be about forcing leadership’s will on the members.”

Grimm put the whip’s assurances to the test April 1, when the Republican majority brought to the floor a transportation bill that would have removed prevailing-wage protections for federally financed construction projects. “We’d really like to have you on this,” McCarthy told Grimm.

“Kevin, I can’t do it,” Grimm replied. He reminded McCarthy that his father had been a union man for 45 years. “I’m not gonna turn my back on my father’s friends that I grew up with and respect.”

McCarthy is aware that some senior members might not be amused by the freshman class’s willingness to go its own way. He organizes dinners that include old and new members. , a 30-year congressman and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the dinners were a way “to disabuse them of the view that we’re ogres and help them understand what we do and don’t do.” Still, the old bulls can deliver some comeuppance to the insurgents. Grimm’s vote to include a pro-union amendment in the transportation bill made the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman, John Mica, “very upset,” Grimm says. “And I get his point: You want me to help you and work with you on things — but you can’t work with me?” Another committee member says: “They’re starting to wake up. I’ve had a bunch come to me and say, ‘I have a horrible flooding problem, I have a bad bridge.’ And I say, ‘Well, then, you shouldn’t have voted for the earmark ban!’ ”

Even McCarthy’s light touch can send a signal of reproach or reward. Last month, the entire G.O.P. House conference traveled to the White House to meet with the president. After Obama’s remarks, McCarthy, Boehner and the other leaders each asked him a question. Then one question came from a pre­selected freshman. It was Reid Ribble, a former roofing contractor from Wisconsin. McCarthy had heard Ribble tell a story over dinner about a seemingly absurd regulation forbidding laborers from drinking water out of a plastic bottle while up on a roof — necessitating that they make frequent trips up and down the ladder, where accidents most often occur. The whip loved it and pushed for Ribble to have the chance to address the president.

There was, however, something else for the majority whip to love about Reid Ribble: he had never crossed the G.O.P. leadership on anything important. There was not a chance that leadership would award this moment to someone like Justin Amash, the only freshman to vote against all four of the continuing resolutions; or to , who in a press release expressed “disappointment in my own leadership” over a financing bill that appeared to be using U.S. troops as a political pawn; or to Raúl Labrador, who in a closed-door conference accused Boehner of “abandoning” conservatives. They and other dissidents are, of course, perfectly free to visit on their own with the president at the White House anytime they wish — if they can.

At 6 o’clock on the afternoon of May 24, just before the polls closed in the western New York special election, where it looked as if the Democratic candidate Kathy Hochul was going to eke out a victory, I dropped by H-107 to see if the whip was experiencing any misgivings over where the Republicans were headed. I found the freshman Rick Berg and Jason Chaffetz, a sophomore, in McCarthy’s office, taking turns tossing a foam ball into a basketball hoop fixed to a door. Chaffetz lobbed me the ball, and I badly misfired. “The way we play,” Berg consoled me, “just hitting the wall counts as a basket.”

My next shot missed the wall. McCarthy let out a high-pitched cackle. By then it was clear that New York’s 26th Congressional district was going to fall to the Democrats, in no small measure because of Hochul’s attacks on the Ryan budget plan. But McCarthy didn’t seem worried. We walked together out of his office, and he took me into the conference room to admire a painting that covered its northern wall. It was a work on from Steve Penley, an artist celebrated by , and other conservatives for his patriotic themes. The canvas depicts a take on Emanuel Leutze’s classic rendering of George Washington crossing the Delaware River on Christmas night 1776, before the Battle of Trenton.

“Now, you know why this was famous,” McCarthy said to me as he pointed to the characters in the painting. “This guy is an African-American. And this is a woman. And this is a Native American. Now, no way would they be able to vote, right? But it symbolizes everyone in America rowing in the boat together. So when we do our meetings here,” he concluded, referring to the freshmen as well as senior Republicans, “we’re all in the boat together!”

I had to ask him, though: where exactly was the boat headed? And who, for that matter, was navigating it? In April, when the Republican leadership decided to back a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning, 59 Republicans defected. The Democratic minority whip, , told me with barely disguised pleasure, “The back-benchers were leading, not the leaders.”

Even if Boehner, Cantor and McCarthy were content with the ideologically drastic direction their boat was taking, a number of their Republican colleagues were clearly not on board. One of them was the Republican Steve LaTourette, a member of the Tuesday Group, the House G.O.P.’s moderate coalition. LaTourette expressed to me his fear that the Republican majority has misinterpreted its mandate from the 2010 midterms. “In the three majority shifts I’ve been a part of, everyone has misread the tea leaves,” he said. “We lost in 2006 because 58 percent of the independents voted Democrat, but we had some in our party saying it was because we weren’t conservative enough. Then Pelosi’s crowd got tossed out, and you had Kucinich and the progressives saying it was because they weren’t bold enough. And now here we are, voting every week on or to do away with NPR. I refer to it as feeding the alligator. You stop feeding them, and then they eat you.”

So was McCarthy really all that sanguine about the boat’s journey? He listened to my skeptical questioning — nodding indulgently, as if I were one of his apple-cheeked Young Guns. Then he gestured to the wall-length canvas. “Just as they planned the surprise attack on the Hessians on Christmas, we’ve got a plan, too,” he insisted. “And we believe where we’re going is where people want us to go. The thing is, history has already judged these guys in the boat favorably. We’ll be judged in the long term and in the short term”— meaning, next year at the polls.

“I do know the final place that we’re getting to,” McCarthy said. He would not say where that place was. I followed him up a staircase onto the second floor of the Capitol, and thereupon he waded into the sea of Republicans convened on the House floor. It was a sound-and-fury kind of afternoon, legislatively speaking: there were two Democratic amendments to strike down, a couple of other bills to set aside as unfinished business and ultimately nothing to send over to the Senate that would stand a chance of becoming law. That was the fruit of the day’s paddling — and beyond that lurked the invisible destination. Maybe they would get there, or maybe along the way an alligator would make a fine dinner of them all. Until then, at least one man in the boat was smiling.

446 2011-07-18 With a protracted racial discrimination lawsuit looming over the Fire Department, the fire commissioner, Salvatore J. Cassano, went to a black church in Queens on Sunday to encourage new applicants.

Mr. Cassano emphasized the job’s benefits and pay — after five years, a firefighter’s annual salary jumps to $100,000 — and used his own humble beginnings to describe the department as a meritocracy.

“I raised five children, four grandchildren, on a salary where I just graduated from high school with no college experience,” Mr. Cassano said, adding, “It wasn’t who you knew; it was what you knew.”

If you work hard, he said, “You can be whoever you want to be.”

The appearance was part of a continuing recruitment effort, focused on churches and community centers and in minority areas across the city, in anticipation of next year’s revamped exam, said Francis X. Gribbon, a department spokesman.

“We’re making sure we get the word out about this exam,” he said.

Mr. Cassano spoke in a chapel of the Greater Allen African Methodist Episcopal Cathedral in Jamaica. Outside the chapel, several firefighters answered questions and explained when and how to sign up for the next department exam, which will probably be given early in the year.

448 2011-07-18 This was Japan’s great moment in women’s soccer — perhaps even better than victories in the World Baseball Classic and the other sports in which the Japanese excel. This classic victory left the American women as the punch line in the future retelling of this wonderful story.

The old do not appreciate having lost the 1969 World Series of baseball, won by the Amazing of New York. and the other basketball players would just as soon not be recalled for losing the historic 1966 title game to the Western regulars. It is no fun being on the perimeter of photographs of a joyous celebration.

All along on this journey, the American women have said, with all due respect to the women of the 1991 (don’t forget them, Gulati cautioned) and 1999 World Cups, they wanted to be judged on their own merits, in their own time. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Women’s soccer has grown considerably in the past dozen years. Other nations, like and and , have supplanted and as world powers. won two straight World Cups in 2003 and 2007. And here came the Japanese, resourceful, skilled, with their coach smiling peacefully — like a wise, reflective mask in a Japanese Noh theater drama — as they broke the huddle to take penalty kicks. And they prevailed. It was Japan’s time, Japan’s legend in the year of Fukushima.

And it must be noted that gave Japan the it deserved, playing up the drama of the stricken nation and the gallantry of Homare Sawa and her teammates.

The United States team is left with new fans back home, fans who recognized the national warriors in and Hope Solo, fans who embraced new cult heroes like the 22-year-old Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe (a reader described her lithe, blond presence as “a wood elf”) who made another magnificent pass to set up Morgan’s goal but was subbed out with the United States ahead in the 114th minute. It’s hard to blame the American coach, Pia Sundhage, since she was the one who inserted Rapinoe before other grand moments earlier in the tournament.

This was a wonderful team that did not win. Once you let yourself get to penalty kicks, don’t count on being saved by a Briana Scurry picking her spot, the way she did in the 1999 shootout, leaving the line to smother a Chinese penalty kick — all it took. Referees are looking for that kind of gamesmanship these days. The crapshoot has gotten tougher.

Not to pick on the 2011 American team hours after a brutal loss, but the 1991 and 1999 players wrapped up the tournament, in their own time, against the best players of the day. A team can only win in its own epoch. The 1927 against the 1961 Yankees? I honestly don’t care.

One thing we do know is that Wambach has long since become the great American striker. On Sunday her informed skull blasted her 13th World Cup goal, thereby passing the great Michelle Akers. During this entire tournament, grown women back home, who came along too soon to play organized soccer, marveled at Wambach’s will. Little boys out there in America could decide that some day they would like to play soccer, or any other sport, as well as Abby Wambach.

Americans discovered the flair of Solo or the serenity of Shannon Boxx or the fire of Heather O’Reilly. The only thing missing is the championship. No player from 1991 or 1999 will ever say this, because there is a straight line of loyalty from Carla Overbeck in 1991 to in 1999 to Carli Lloyd today. Except for one thing. The 1991 team and the 1999 team won the World Cup, but Japan, brave Japan, won the 2011 Women’s World Cup.
449 2011-07-18 Mr. Milchan was not accused of wrongdoing, but the case drew scrutiny to his activities in the arms business even as he stepped up his film career under deals first at Warner Brothers, then at 20th Century Fox, whose parent company bought a stake in his Regency Enterprises. In the glow of friendships with the likes of Brad Pitt and Robert De Niro, speculation about his intrigues seemed to fade — until a pair of unlikely biographers decided to figure out why Israel had been filtering a large part of its military budget through Hollywood hands.

Mr. Doron spoke recently over coffee at a patio cafe here, expressing puzzlement at Israel’s reliance on a middleman to broker deals that seemingly could have been made without the services of his Milchan Brothers umbrella company and affiliates.

He was flanked by Mr. Gelman, who sipped watermelon juice, and joined in explaining how the two — who are brothers-in-law — conceived of writing about Mr. Milchan, who had been vaguely identified in Israel’s press as the “Chuck Norris of the Lakam.” Mr. Gelman, who was born in the United States, had lived in Israel and served as a paratrooper during the 1982 war in Lebanon. Mr. Doron had been a writer and editor specializing in Israeli military issues.

Never having written together, they began culling public records and published accounts. Eventually, they met Mr. Smyth, who was by then living in Lompoc, Calif., and, with his story in hand, cobbled together a draft of their book before approaching Mr. Milchan.

“Should I be concerned?” Mr. Milchan asked during a first conversation by phone in 2009, Mr. Gelman said. A major worry, Mr. Gelman told him, was the impression that he had profited hugely from Israel’s security dilemmas.

“I did it for my country, the money did not go to me,” Mr. Gelman recalled Mr. Milchan explaining, when the three later met, and began a series of sessions that went on for six months.

Mr. Milchan’s disclaimer about profiteering provoked further research into how various companies set up by Mr. Milchan or associated with Milchan Brothers traded in arms for Israel and other countries. While doing so, he set aside money in accounts for use by Israel, allowing that country’s prime minister “to execute decisions beyond Israel’s borders without the need for the formal budgeting, cabinet approvals, petty internal politics, or leaks to the press that might endanger the operation.”

In the end, the book was not authorized by Mr. Milchan. The account was based partly on interviews with the likes of Shimon Peres, the Israeli president who, according to the book, acknowledged having “recruited” Mr. Milchan as a clandestine operative.

“Confidential” was sold to Gefen Publishing by David Kuhn, a literary agent who was previously an editor at Brill’s Content and The New Yorker. Its narrative follows Mr. Milchan through his first acquaintance with the arms business via his father’s company, through his introduction to Israel’s nuclear program by Mr. Peres and the Lakam chief, Benjamin Blumberg.

After the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Mr. Milchan began acquiring both big-ticket conventional weapons and krytrons, devices that can trigger nuclear bombs. In the middle of it all, he was introduced to the film business by Elliott Kastner, now deceased, the American producer with whom he collaborated on a 1977 picture, “The Stick-Up.”

Mr. Milchan thought the movie bad enough to remove his credit but he immediately backed another film, “Black Joy,” that appeared at the Cannes Film Festival. By the early 1980s, Mr. Milchan was a force in Hollywood, with a growing string of credits on films like “The King of Comedy” and “Once Upon a Time in America,” both with Mr. De Niro — and the movies soon became not just convenient cover, but a full-blown second career.

In the late 1990s, the News Corporation, which owns Fox, paid $200 million for a 20 percent stake in Mr. Milchan’s Regency Enterprises. A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, had no immediate response to a query about the company’s reason for backing Mr. Milchan, and about any reaction by its chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, to revelations in the new book. (Mr. Milchan’s latest film for Fox, the comedy “Monte Carlo,” opened to soft reviews and modest prospects a few weeks ago.)

Asked whether Mr. Milchan would discuss the book, his executive assistant, Jane Bulmer, said he was traveling and out of reach. But, Ms. Bulmer said in an e-mail, Mr. Milchan had told her “that he has not read the book and does not plan on commenting on any unauthorized books that have been written about him.”

As for Mr. Milchan’s current status with Israeli intelligence, Mr. Gelman and Mr. Doron declined to venture a guess. “We really don’t know with certainty,” Mr. Gelman said.
450 2011-07-18 The commission will hold its first — and probably only — public hearing on Wednesday in Albany. As a result, its members, appointed by the governor, legislative leaders and the state’s chief judge, are being inundated with formulas and charts.

The suggestions include every manner of numerical calculation, with most using as a point of reference the current $136,700 salary of State Supreme Court justices, who handle a wide range of cases, including murder cases and malpractice trials, and whose pay would have risen 41 percent if they had received raises to keep pace with inflation, according to one filing.

Each interest group had its own math. The New York City Bar Association argued that given how expensive it is to live in New York City, Supreme Court justices would have to earn $212,000 to be paid in line with the salaries of other big-city judges across the country.

The New York County Lawyers’ Association did another calculation: a $60,000 raise “would increase the state budget by less than 55 one-thousandths of one percent.”

Not to be outdone, a coalition of 12 judges’ organizations put forth 50 facts justifying a big raise, including salaries in New York City’s Sanitation Department: 50 employees in the department earn more than almost all New York judges and nearly as much as the state’s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman.

Judge Lippman makes $156,000; an intermediate appeals judge makes $144,000; a criminal court judge makes $125,600. The commissioners said they would keep in place the comparative differences for the various levels of the courts.

One commission member, Mark S. Mulholland, a Long Island lawyer, said in an interview that there were numbers of formulas that people were using to make their cases.

But he insisted he was not overwhelmed by numbers as lawyers sometimes are. “I actually did well in math,” he said.

Officials at the state’s Office of Court Administration presented the commissioners with their own ways of looking at the numbers, including a comparison of New York’s judicial salaries with the salaries of judges in other states. New York came in dead last.

The court administrators suggested setting the salary for a State Supreme Court justice between $192,000 and $220,000, a range seemingly intended to give the commission ample leeway to grant a big raise. If, for example, the commission chose a salary less than $192,000, it could appear fiscally responsible even as it doled out raises of 30 percent or so.

For much of the past dozen years, the discussion of judicial salaries has not drawn much passion. But with the commission tackling the issue at a time of state budget problems, the idea of increasing any state salaries is not popular.

State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview that a raise to $220,000 for judges “may not be consistent with the tough environment that’s going on right now.” He said that in some areas of the state “if a vacancy occurred, you would have lawyers lining up for Supreme Court at the current salary.”

In the media and on the Internet, the prospect of a big judicial raise is beginning to draw fiery comments. Judges deserve a raise, “but 62 percent in one shot?” The New York Post asked in an editorial last week after the court administration officials had filed their submission. “No way,” the paper commented.

David Bookstaver, the spokesman for the court system, said the proposal offered the commission a range of salary possibilities based on factors set forth in the law. As for the criticism, Mr. Bookstaver called it “a mischaracterization of our submission.”

During the panel’s meeting last week, three of the seven commissioners appeared ready to grant judges a large raise quickly, two did not suggest views and two said the size of any raise had to be limited by the state’s fiscal troubles. “How much can the state afford?” asked Bill Mulrow, who was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

In the filings, the formulas and calculations are stitched together with arguments. So far, the most ardent — and the wordiest— is the one by the judicial associations, which runs 247 pages. “When someone finds out that you are a judge,” it said, “and you have not had a raise in over 12 years, most people say, ‘That’s crazy.’ ”
451 2011-07-18 As Goldman Sachs remains the subject of legal inquiry, guessing the longevity of Lloyd C. Blankfein’s tenure as its chief executive has become the summer’s Wall Street parlor game. Even Warren E. Buffett opined on the subject this month (naturally he wants him to stay).

Barring any new, unsavory disclosures, it’s hard to see why Goldman’s board shouldn’t back Mr. Blankfein for his handling of precrisis business practices. The greater worry is Goldman’s financial performance. Either way, Goldman should use this period of soul-searching to seize on a chance to improve its governance.

Talk of Mr. Blankfein’s security atop Goldman, which he has now led for five years, stems largely from questions of whether the firm acted improperly ahead of the 2008 financial crisis by, among other things, short-changing clients; and whether Mr. Blankfein misled Congress about the firm’s bets against the housing market.

On balance, these questions look like misdemeanors no worse than those committed by other banks. JPMorgan recently settled similar charges. As for Mr. Blankfein’s Congressional testimony, his remarks on Goldman’s bets against the housing market surely ring today as economical. But to make a case for perjury requires a far higher standard of proof — one that the facts at present don’t seem to support.

Of course, the Justice Department and New York’s attorney general are continuing to scour legal documents, e-mails and trading records. They could still find something fresh that implicates the firm. For that reason alone, the board needs to keep Mr. Blankfein in place. As a former top partner of the firm says, Mr. Blankfein’s resignation could be the “collateral for a trade” that authorities eventually seek as a settlement — or, in extremis, to head off an indictment.
452 2011-07-18 Robin Soderling beat David Ferrer of Spain, 6-2, 6-2, to win the Swedish Open in Bastad for the second time in three years. The fifth-ranked Soderling, a Swede, has won four tournaments this year.

¶ Juan Carlos Ferrero defeated Pablo Andujar, 6-4, 6-0, in an all-Spanish final of the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Germany. Ferrero was playing only his third tournament of the year after missing two months with wrist and knee injuries.

¶ María José Martínez Sanchez of Spain defeated the Austrian wild card Patricia Mayr-Archleitner, 6-0, 7-5, in the final of the Gastein Ladies in Bad Gastein, Austria. It was Martínez’s fourth career title, and all have been on clay.

¶ Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain beat Polona Hercog of Slovenia, 6-3, 6-2, to win the Palermo Open in Sicily for the fifth time. Medina Garrigues holds the record for most clay-court titles among active players with 10, overtaking Venus Williams, who has nine.
453 2011-07-18 Analysts say that Mr. Najib’s meeting with the pope is intended to demonstrate to Malaysian Christians that the government considers their religion important enough to warrant a state-level visit.

“Muslim-Christian relations in Malaysia have taken a hammering since the Badawi period,” said Farish Ahmad Noor, a political scientist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, referring to Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who was prime minister from 2003 to 2009. “And many Christian groups now feel that they have been neglected by an uncaring government.”

“But the Najib administration has to show once and for all that it will not allow the harassment of Christians to continue in the country,” Mr. Farish said.

Since Mr. Najib became prime minister in 2009, he has sought to project Malaysia as a moderate Muslim-majority nation.

Shamsul Amri Baharuddin, the head of the Institute of Ethnic Studies at the National University of Malaysia, said the federal government had made many attempts at interfaith dialogue in recent years. But these attempts have not been very successful, he said, in part because many aspects of religious practice are controlled by the state, like regulations regarding Muslims who renounce the faith.

Forming ties with the Vatican would contribute to Mr. Najib’s “1Malaysia” policy, which promotes national unity and inclusiveness, Mr. Shamsul said.

The Rev. Lawrence Andrew, editor of The Herald, the Roman Catholic Church’s weekly newspaper in Kuala Lumpur, said he thought the country had not previously pursued diplomatic relations with the Vatican out of a fear among many Malaysians that Christians would try to convert Muslims. But he said that this concern appears to have diminished in recent years.

“They have seen that the Catholics are not the type who go and proselytize and convert the Muslims,” he said.

In Malaysia, ethnic Malays are automatically considered Muslim. Muslims who wish to convert to Christianity must obtain permission from Islamic courts, but it is rarely granted.

Religious tensions were reignited in May when a Malay-language newspaper published a report alleging that Christians wanted to make Christianity the country’s official religion, a contention vehemently denied by Christian leaders.

Father Andrew said that while there may still be a “pocket of people” who champion the rights of Muslims over other groups, he sensed that Malaysia as a whole was becoming more accepting of other religions.

“There’s an opening up,” he said, adding that he views the meeting with the pope “as a positive thing.”
454 2011-07-18 With those bonds now worth less, calls are growing for Europe to take urgent action to recapitalize its banks, as the United States and Britain did in 2008 when the financial crisis damaged the balance sheets of their banks. At the same time, the problems of Europe’s banks also mean it will be difficult for the spendthrift faction of European nations to rely on them to borrow aggressively to finance budget deficits, largely with impunity, as they did until 2008.

The prospect that the flu will spread beyond Greece and Spain to infect Italy and perhaps even France and Belgium, is sure to be a point of urgent discussion on Thursday in Brussels at the debt summit meeting for European Union leaders.

The exposure of European banks to sovereign debt is a point that regulators have long underscored, most recently and acutely in an illuminating report issued this month by the Bank for International Settlements.

The report highlighted just how thin the capital buffers are for banks in highly indebted European nations. For example, banking systems in Belgium, Greece and Italy are sitting on local government bond holdings that range from 60 percent to 90 percent of total bank capital.

“Until recently, investors have paid little attention to diversifying their portfolios of government bonds of advanced countries, as these bonds were considered virtually riskless,” the report warned. "This situation has changed: some sovereign securities have already lost their risk-free status, while others may do so in the future,” it said. Take Greece, for instance. The National Bank of Greece passed its test with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11 percent, compared with a minimum of 5 percent required to pass. But the bank holds 18 billion euros worth of Greek bonds that are, at best, worth half that amount, and if written down accordingly would immediately wipe out the bank’s capital of 8.1 billion euros.

BNP Paribas in France and Commerzbank in Germany also passed, but they own 5 billion and 3 billion euros, respectively, in Greek bonds. (As is the case with most banks, these assets are held in the banking book, not the trading book, so they do not reflect the true market value until written down.)

But it is to Italy, which, with its huge debt financing burden, is home to the world’s third largest bond market after Japan and the United States, that Europe’s banks remain most heavily exposed.

It was the Greek finance minister who zeroed in on this point last week. Yes, Greece’s debt is high at 355 billion euros, Evangelos Venizelos said in a speech to his Parliament. But it was not as dire as Italy’s, he argued, because Italy borrows about that amount in a single year to keep current on its own financial obligations, which at 120 percent of gross domestic product are second only to those of Greece itself.

Again BNP Paribas stands out in that regard, owning 28 billion euros in Italian bonds (just about half its core capital at the end of 2010). Other big holders of Italian bonds include Commerzbank with 11 billion euros and Crédit Agricole in France with 10.7 billion euros.

Unicredit, the large Italy-based bank with significant operations outside its core market, remains tied to the fortunes of its home country. At 49 billion euros, its Italian government bond holdings are 140 percent of capital as of 2010, according to stress test data.

Italian government debt does not carry anywhere close to the risk of its Greek counterpart. Italy’s budget deficit of 4 percent of gross domestic product puts it in a different category, and there has been no talk of Italy’s not being in a position to keep paying its obligations.

But as foreign and domestic holders of Italian bonds keep selling their holdings — bankers remark that many of the sellers are weak holders who were attracted to the higher yield but never thought that Italy would be lumped with Greece and others —  the price of the benchmark Italian bond has plummeted and the yield has spiked.

What was once seen as more or less a risk-free asset is becoming increasingly less so, as the Bank for International Settlements’ report notes.

Beyond the sovereign debt question, other revelations are to be found in the individual bank disclosures.

The British banking giant Barclays, for example, has significant exposure to the troubled Spanish economy. After its home country and the United States, Spain represents the third largest credit market for Barclays. (Of this 43.9 billion euros, close to half is loans to Spain’s devastated mortgage and commercial real estate sectors.)

And the British-government controlled Royal Bank of Scotland has 64 billion euros of dubious Irish loans on its books (12 billion euros of which is already in default), compared with a capital level of 58 billion euros at the end of 2010.

For now, all these banks can say that they have passed Europe’s latest banking crucible. Many have also raised equity over the last year to address market concerns.

But as the crisis worsens, it may well be the case that today’s capital cushion will not be enough to cover tomorrow’s sovereign bond losses.

470 2011-07-19 As part of the deal, on Monday the labels and Baidu agreed to a settlement endorsed by the Beijing Higher People’s Court ending all outstanding litigation. For years, the American and Chinese music industries have singled out Baidu for criticism, saying the company has enabled users to steal vast quantities of copyrighted music, accusations that spurred a number of unsuccessful lawsuits.

In February, the United States trade representative named Baidu as one of the world’s 33 “notorious markets” for piracy and counterfeiting, centering on Baidu’s practice of “deep linking,” or providing search results that direct users to unlicensed songs on other Web sites. Although American search engines have long been forced to abandon such practices, Chinese courts had ruled that deep linking was legal because the music was not stored on Baidu’s servers.

Despite those favorable court decisions, Baidu has now agreed to remove all deep links to music belonging to the three labels, though a small amount of other independently loaded music may remain available. “We’ve never wanted to stand there and thumb our noses at the recording industry,” said Kaiser Kuo, Baidu’s director of international communications. “This is a watershed moment. It’s a great way for us to deliver the best possible user experience by providing free and high-quality music and brings obvious tangible benefits to all parties involved including the labels, artists and advertisers.”

Later this year, as part of the agreement, Baidu plans to introduce a premium fee-based service which will allow paying users to download music onto any computer, tablet or mobile device from a virtual storage locker.

Mr. Kuo added that music search was profitable but had never been a source of major traffic. He said it accounted for a high of 30 percent in 2004 and was now less than 10 percent.

The big label licensing agreement is the company’s latest move toward a more legitimate business model since its rival Google began directing mainland Chinese Web users to its Hong Kong site in March 2010.

In late March this year, Baidu announced it had deleted 2.8 million written works from its online library service, Wenku, in an effort to appease Chinese authors who demanded compensation, arguing that the company allowed pirated content on the site’s servers for free download. The move came days after China’s National Copyright Administration stated that it was investigating the company for copyright infringement of books.

A few days later, Baidu said it would pay a fee to songwriters belonging to the Music Copyright Society of China, the country’s official performing rights organization, each time one of their songs was downloaded or streamed through Baidu. Last year the organization won a rare lawsuit against Baidu over the company’s providing unauthorized lyrics to 50 songs on its servers.

Other Internet and media companies in China have signed contracts with music labels, with varying degrees of success. China Mobile made over $2 billion from its licensed ring tone service in 2009 alone, giving record companies a cut of the purchase price. Google in China offers more than a million songs for free through download and streaming and shares ad revenue. But at 84 percent, according to iResearch, an analytics firm based in Shanghai, Baidu’s share of the Chinese Internet search market dwarfs that of Google and other rivals. Its agreement with Universal, Warner and Sony BMG, which account for most of the global music market, is expected to give the industry a brighter outlook in China after years of frustration.

“We’re delighted with this because it means Baidu is genuinely partnering with us to move China’s legitimate music market forward,” said Max Hole, chief operating officer of Universal Music Group International, speaking on behalf of One-Stop China in a phone interview.
471 2011-07-19 The revelations by the government this month that contaminated meat reached Japanese markets have intensified food safety concerns in Japan, underscoring the government’s inability to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation’s food.

Radioactive material has been detected in a range of produce, including spinach, tea leaves, milk and fish. Contaminated hay has been found at farms more than 85 miles from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, suggesting that the radioactive fallout has reached a wider area than first suspected.

Still, because of a severe shortage of testing equipment, and local governments that are still swamped with disaster relief, only a small percentage of farm products grown in the region get checked for radiation.

The government has suspended agricultural shipments from within a radius of about 12 miles around the Fukushima plant, as well as a number of other identified radiation “hot spots.” But farms outside those areas, even those relatively close to the plant, have faced few restrictions in shipping their produce.

For months the government balked at placing a wider ban on produce from the Fukushima region despite sporadic discoveries of contaminated produce, for fear of bringing fresh confusion in the disaster-stricken area, putting thousands more people out of work and adding to growing compensation claims for Tokyo Electric Power, which operates the Fukushima plant.

Now, with the number of contamination cases rising, the government is finally moving to ban beef shipments from Fukushima Prefecture, an area of 5,300 square miles, slightly smaller than Connecticut. Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary, said Tuesday that the government was in the “final stages” of coordinating such a ban and an announcement could come later that day.

Fukushima Prefecture has also said it issued instructions in late March warning farmers to make sure hay was stored indoors, to prevent possible contamination from rain. But many farmers said they were not aware of such a directive.

Cattle from some areas with high radiation readings, including here in Minamisoma, a city in Fukushima Prefecture, had been checked for radiation on the surface of their skins before being shipped to market. But those checks do not sufficiently measure whether cattle have been exposed to radiation internally by eating contaminated feed, officials say.

Fukushima government officials said they were starting inspections of all 4,000 or so cattle farms in the prefecture to make sure that none of them was using radioactive hay. Meanwhile, ranchers have been asked to comply with a new voluntary shipment ban.

This month, officials testing hay fed to cattle at a ranch in Minamisoma detected radioactive cesium 250 times above Japan’s official limit. Beef from that farm contained almost five times the official limit.

Officials suspect that the hay was stored outside and became tainted with rainwater, which can carry radioactive elements in the atmosphere as it falls. Though hay is not usually fed to cattle here, a feed-supply shortage after the March 11 quake and tsunami forced some farms to substitute it for other food.

Some farmers in the region say that they welcome tougher checks, and that cattle can still be shipped from Fukushima if precautions are taken against radiation exposure.

Yuta Furuyama, who has 233 cattle in Minamisoma, is certain his herd is clean. His cattle are kept indoors, and their feed is stored in thick plastic bags, out of the rain. He said he was careful to not even bring tools that he has used outside into the cowshed, for fear of contaminating his herd, which he is eager to have tested for radiation so that his cattle can be safely sold later this year.

“I hope they will finally step up the checks,” he said. “If the government had given proper advice and done proper tests in the first place, things wouldn’t have gotten out of hand.”

Japanese government officials insist that even at levels above government limits, radioactive cesium will not have an immediate effect on health. Longer-term effects are less known, however. Many experts say that prolonged exposure to radiation can lead to a higher incidence of cancers like leukemia.

“If you eat it every day, it might be a problem,” Goshi Hosono, the minister in charge of the nuclear issue, said last week. “But if you eat just a little, there would be no big effect on your health.”

Experts, however, disagree on what the effects may be of exposure to radiation above the limits but at low doses.

Some farms have sold off their herds in recent weeks, at even lower prices than the Fukushima label now fetches. On a large cattle farm in the neighboring village of Iitate, the cowsheds lie eerily empty. Since the accident, the farm rushed to sell off its 312 cows, said Akio Takahashi, who has worked there for 23 years.

After March 11, cattle sold for about $6,330 a head, about a third less than the price before the quake, he said. Then as radiation fears increased, prices plummeted further.

Panicked, the farm decided to sell its remaining 180 cattle all at once in early July, including calves still not ready for market, at rock-bottom prices to farms outside Fukushima. Those cattle were screened for radiation, Mr. Takahashi said.

When the cattle were gone, Mr. Takahashi was let go. He is now looking for a city job.

“It’s finished,” he said. “Nobody will ever want to eat beef from Fukushima again.”
472 2011-07-19 The owner, Steven T. Huff, 60, has heard all the “goofy speculation,” as he calls it. His background — he sold the company he founded that makes software for military and intelligence agencies to Textron several years ago — has encouraged the rumors. But he said that his current work prompted him to build such a large second home.

As a major investor and board chairman of TF Concrete Forming Systems, he wanted to demonstrate the viability of new concrete technology that he believes will lower energy consumption. The size of the building, which is significantly larger than the White House, partly reflects a desire to build at a commercial scale for testing purposes, he said. He adds that he plans to have many guests.

The house — officially a single-family residence — has been under construction for nearly two years, and a recently posted Web site shows its progress. There are probably another two years to go before it is completed, which has irritated some neighbors who say the work has disrupted the serenity of the area and has cut off what used to be prime hunting grounds. Mr. Huff would not reveal the cost. (Though the purchase price of the land is not public, Christian County records show the more than 500 acres, historically used for logging and grazing cattle, was appraised at just over $50,000.)

Mr. Huff, a longtime resident of Virginia, chose the site on Woods Fork Road because it is just hours from his boyhood home. Also, he said building in that part of the country would help him show how the technology handles both hot and cold weather and even tornadoes. Finally, there is another advantage — by locating in an area famous for a small government approach, he is not subject to building regulations or inspection, which he said would have complicated his efforts.

“We try not to be more intrusive than we have to,” said Todd Wiesehan, planning and zoning administrator for the county. He added that Mr. Huff had nevertheless invited some local officials to tour the construction site. “You don’t appreciate just how large it is until you drive up,” Mr. Wiesehan said. “It’s very, very big.”
473 2011-07-19 J. Paul Oetken, a former Clinton administration lawyer, on Monday became the first openly gay man to be confirmed as a federal judge.

Mr. Oetken won Senate confirmation by a vote of 80 to 13. He will take his seat as a federal judge in Manhattan after President Obama signs his commission, which may be as soon as this week, according to the office of Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.

“When there are so many qualified gay and lesbian people and none of them get on the bench, you scratch your head and wonder why,” said Mr. Schumer, who recommended the appointment last year to Mr. Obama. “But the old barriers that existed in society are crumbling. That’s what this will say.”

Mr. Oetken, 45, a graduate of Yale Law School, was a law clerk to Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the Supreme Court before working for the Justice Department and then as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton.

He is now a senior vice president and associate general counsel at Cablevision.

Deborah A. Batts, a lesbian, has been a federal judge in Manhattan since 1994.
474 2011-07-19 Genop represents a particularly thorny problem for Mr. Papandreou. It is a creation of the governing Socialist Party, which over the years helped build up the labor-centric jobs-for-votes system that the prime minister is now forced to dismantle. To carry out the reforms, Mr. Papandreou will have to strike at the heart of his own party — and it remains to be seen whether he has the muscle, let alone the stomach, to do so.

“That’s a real war, and a very uncertain war,” said Takis Pappas, a political science professor at the University of Macedonia. “Is Papandreou’s army strong enough to withstand this storm? Let’s wait and see.”

The battle with the power company’s workers and their union is even more personal for Mr. Papandreou. In 2007, Mr. Fotopoulos endorsed Mr. Papandreou as Socialist Party leader.

Sitting at his desk, Mr. Fotopoulos pointed to photos showing Mr. Papandreou visiting the power corporation’s office with union workers. Next to them is a photo of George Papaconstantinou, now Greece’s energy and environment minister — responsible, among other things, for selling off more of the government’s stake in the power company.

Above Mr. Papaconstantinou’s head, someone had written a cartoon bubble that read, “O.K., Mr. Fotopoulos, if you don’t agree, then I’d better leave.”

The government owns 51 percent of the power corporation and controls its board. The state sold the other 49 percent in a partial privatization in 2000.

Mr. Fotopoulos, 49, a compact, bearded man with an iron handshake, said the union endorsed Mr. Papandreou as Socialist Party leader in 2007 because he seemed “more approachable, warmer, closer and more concerned about our problems.”

“We still respect him as a politician and a person,” he said, “but we believe these are barbaric policies that go against the interests of the Greek people.”

To many analysts, the coziness between the Socialist Party and the union is a sign of the difficulties the government is likely to encounter in selling off more of the power corporation, as it is scheduled to do in 2012.

This month, Mr. Papaconstantinou said that rather than selling more of the Public Power Corporation at the current lower market rates, the government might explore alternatives, including selling off some of its hydroelectric or lignite-powered plants while looking for a strategic investor.

Arthouros Zervos, the power corporation’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview that there was some wiggle room in the agreement between Greece and its lenders that was approved by Parliament. Under the accord, the government has agreed to sell $71 billion in state assets by 2015.

“I think there is a possibility of a negotiation there,” Mr. Zervos said. “This commitment is mainly in terms of bringing a certain amount of money from the privatization to pay down the debt. So my reading is if you have some alternative ways of bringing that money, that could be discussed with the troika.”

Unlike other public sector companies in Greece, the power corporation is profitable, producing a return of $790 million in 2010 from $8.2 billion in sales. But analysts are worried that its future profit picture is clouded by regulatory uncertainties and, most crucially, the sway of its unions.

To many people, the issue is not simply about selling a stake in state-run companies, but about how to transform Greece’s public sector. “It’s not about making money; it’s about changing a culture,” said Panagis Vourloumis, who was chief executive of the Greek telecommunications monopoly OTE under the previous center-right government and oversaw the sale of a 30 percent stake in the company to Deutsche Telekom in 2008.

The culture of formerly public companies is proving resistant to change. “Irrespective of price, it is really about, ‘Do you have the leverage to run a company that has never been private before?’ ” said Jens Bastian, an economist at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens.

Analysts say the government has not convinced voters that privatization is a long-term remedy for the Greek economy. Selling off public corporations is deeply unpopular among Greeks, who fear a fire sale of state assets and applaud Genop and other unions for protesting.

But in the growing divide in Greece between public-sector and private-sector workers, an increasing number of Greeks regard the power company workers in particular as an overpaid, overprotected caste. According to Mr. Fotopoulos, Genop’s 21,000 members are paid an average net salary of $1,980 a month and its 35,000 retirees an average net pension of $2,122 a month — much higher than the Greek average.

“The unions are even worse than the politicians,” said Theodoros Yiannopoulos, as he sold bread rolls from a street cart in downtown Athens. “They were going to five-star hotels in Europe and sending the bill here.”

He was referring to a recent report by Greece’s public administration inspector, which found that since the 1980s, the power corporation had paid Genop more than $32 million, largely for “social tourism,” or vacation subsidies — but also to pay for protest demonstrations against the company itself, a surreal twist that captures the complex vested interests that are proving so hard for Mr. Papandreou to untangle.

Mr. Fotopoulos called the report “a smear campaign” and said the subsidies were part of the contract negotiated by the company and the union.

Others say the battle is as much political as economic. “The biggest challenge is for the politicians to believe that there’s still a future without unions,” said Takis Athanasopoulos, who clashed bitterly with Genop as chief executive officer of the Public Power Corporation under the previous government.

The telephone interview was interrupted at one point when his line went dead — from a power failure caused by a Genop protest.
475 2011-07-19 The top judicial body of the United Nations ordered Cambodia and Thailand to withdraw troops from a disputed temple on Monday and established a demilitarized zone along their mountainous border. The two countries have fought each other numerous times in recent years near Preah Vihear, an ancient hilltop temple that stirs nationalist sentiments in both countries and where Cambodian troops are seen in the photo above. Both sides said they would comply with the order by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. However, the Thai military has in the past criticized concessions on the temple by the country’s civilian leadership and may balk at what they perceive as giving further ground to Cambodia.
476 2011-07-19 As of July 15, one more country was declared free of the guinea worm: Sudan.

But it was a hollow victory. That was the date Sudan split in two and South Sudan became the world’s newest country — and all the known Sudanese cases are in the south.

As of early July, 98 percent of the world’s 806 guinea worm cases were in South Sudan. The rest were in Ethiopia (six cases), Mali (three) and Chad (two). Guinea worm infection, or dracunculiasis (meaning “affliction with little dragons”), is transmitted by drinking water containing microscopic flealike creatures with worm larvae in their intestines. The larvae break out, migrate just under the skin and grow until they resemble yardlong strands of angel-hair pasta.

Then they exude acid to make a painful blister, and a new crop of larvae bursts out when the victim dips the burning limb in water.

A global eradication campaign is fighting the worms by pouring a mild pesticide into ponds and giving people fine mesh filters.

According to the latest report from the campaign, a joint project of the Carter Center in Atlanta, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the number of cases in South Sudan rose slightly from last year.

Almost 6,000 villages are supposed to be under surveillance, the campaign reported, but a W.H.O. representative recently found that local monitors were badly trained and unsupervised.
477 2011-07-19 Re “In Midwest, Flutters May Be Far Fewer” (July 12): Yes, flutters are far fewer, according to my unofficial gauge of insect numbers in Missouri — my windshield remains remarkably clean after 200-mile round trips deep into the Ozarks. I did not see a single monarch last fall. I no longer observe swallows and bats hunting at dusk. Ditto nighthawks and other mysterious aerialists of the night that would be attracted to stadium lights and their insect bounty. Genetically modified crops and overuse of Roundup? Perhaps. But the parts of Missouri that I frequent are not exactly prime crop land, mostly wooded or pasture land. I think the answer is more complex.
478 2011-07-19 Although the European Central Bank sees the idea of buying back bonds as a way of making the private sector accept losses voluntarily, Germany in particular is pressing for banks to take a bigger share of the pain.

It has proposed an additional plan under which Greek bonds that are set to expire before 2014 would have their maturities extended by seven years. The E.C.B. and some countries worry that such a move would be classified as a selective default and thus spread contagion throughout the euro zone.

On Monday, the German newspaper Die Welt reported that a new tax on banks was another option, and officials who were not authorized to speak publicly said that the idea had been raised in discussions. In fact the European Commission has already proposed using a fee on European banks to create a fund to deal with future crises.

Some banks are said to favor the idea of channeling their contributions into the Greek bailout. But those with low exposure are likely to be opposed, and some euro zone officials doubt whether such a levy could be constructed equitably.

Negotiations on other elements of a second bailout, expected to be worth an additional €80 billion to €90 billion, or $113 billion to $127 billion, appear to be progressing more smoothly. Among proposals under consideration, loans to the troubled countries would be offered at only one percentage point above the rates at which they are borrowed. Lending, at present made over terms of 5 years or 10 years, could be extended to 20 years.

Two main models have emerged for the buybacks, according to officials briefed on the talks. Under one, these would be administered by the euro zone’s bailout fund, though this would require a change in regulations. Under the other, the Athens would be lent the resources to set up an agency that would take responsibility for buying back the bonds.

The suspense, and recent investor sales of Italian and Spanish bonds, have made analysts increasingly pessimistic.

“The euro zone crisis has recently worsened significantly, exacerbated by disagreements between the E.U.’s key politicians,” said Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group in London. “It is becoming increasingly clear that there will have to be major steps toward fiscal union or the euro zone will begin to disintegrate.” She added that the “debt crisis can fairly be described as having morphed into a political crisis.”

The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark index of European blue chip stocks, ended the day nearly 2 percent lower, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell 2.04 percent. Wall Street opened weaker, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down just over 1 percent. The euro weakened to $1.4052 at midafternoon from $1.4157 late Friday.

Further clouding the picture were the stress tests carried out by regulators on the region’s banks. The results were released after markets closed Friday. The threshold to pass the test was set at a core Tier 1 capital ratio, which encompasses safe assets, of 5 percent. Of the 90 banks, eight failed, with an aggregate capital shortfall €2.5 billion. But the exercise left unanswered questions about how many healthier lenders would survive a deepening of the debt crisis, given their exposure to Greek, Italian and Spanish bonds. A sovereign default case was excluded from the tests.

Further complicating the latest Greek rescue efforts, Jean-Claude Trichet, the E.C.B. president, reiterated during an interview published Monday in The Financial Times Deutschland that the central bank would not accept bonds from any defaulting country as collateral. That could leave Greek banks without financing if credit agencies saw a restructuring, even a voluntary one, as a default.

“Now that the clock has struck 12, it’s the euro zone’s ultimate Cinderella moment,” said one European diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly. “Magic won’t solve excessive deficits and debilitating debts. It’s going to take hard work and a realization that in this hour Europe must come together or face fragmentation.”
479 2011-07-19 “Parliament was misled,” Mr. Whittingdale said. “It will be a lengthy and detailed discussion.”

Mr. Murdoch has indicated he wants to cooperate.

“We think it’s important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public,” he said last week. “It’s best just to be as transparent as possible.”

Ms. Brooks’s representative, David Wilson, said she maintained her innocence and looked forward to clearing her name, but declined to answer specific questions.

As a trickle of revelations has become a torrent, the company switched from containment to crisis mode. Ms. Brooks and others first made the case that other newspapers had also hacked phones, and they sought to dig up evidence to prove it, interviews show.

At a private meeting, Rupert Murdoch warned Paul Dacre, the editor of the rival Daily Mail newspaper and one of the most powerful men on Fleet Street, that “we are not going to be the only bad dog on the street,” according to an account that Mr. Dacre gave to his management team. Mr. Murdoch’s spokesman did not respond to questions about his private conversations.

Former company executives and political aides assert that executives at News International, the News Corporation’s British subsidiary, carried out a campaign of selective leaks implicating previous management and the police. Company officials deny that. The Metropolitan Police responded with a statement alleging a “deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into the alleged payments by corrupt journalists to corrupt police officers.”

Mr. Murdoch was attending a conference in , , early this month when it became clear that the latest eruption of the hacking scandal was not, as he first thought, a passing problem. According to a person briefed on the conversation, he proposed to one senior executive that he “fly commercial to London,” so he might be seen as a man of the people. He was told that would hardly do the trick, and he arrived on a Gulfstream G550 private jet.

Evidence Was There All Along

The storm Mr. Murdoch flew into had been brewing since 2006, when the tabloid’s royalty reporter and a private investigator were prosecuted for hacking into the messages of the royal household staff in search of juicy news exclusives. For years afterward, company executives publicly insisted that the hacking was limited to that one “rogue reporter.”

resigned as editor of The News of the World after the prosecution, but said he knew nothing. “If you’re talking about illegal tapping by a private investigator,” Rupert Murdoch declared in February 2007, “that is not part of our culture anywhere in the world, least of all in Britain.”

But it turns out that almost from the beginning, executives of News International, the British subsidiary that owns the tabloid, had access to information indicating that other reporters were also engaged in the practice.

During the royal hacking case, had seized thousands of pages of records with the names of thousands of possible hacking targets from the home of the private investigator, , who worked for the tabloid. While the police largely limited their investigation to the royalty case, lawyers representing people believed to be victims of hacking fought for access to Mr. Mulcaire’s records and made them available to the tabloid executives during the litigation.

In the initial cases, News International saw documents naming other journalists, according to details of those cases obtained by . Notes in Mr. Mulcaire’s files include the names “Ian” and “Neville,” apparent references to the news editor, , and the chief reporter, .

James Murdoch, who oversees and operations for the News Corporation, signed off on a £700,000 settlement with Gordon Taylor, a soccer union boss who was the first to sue. One condition of the payment was confidentiality.

This month, James Murdoch acknowledged he was wrong to settle the suit, saying he did not “have a complete picture of the case” at the time.

Ms. Brooks personally persuaded Max Clifford, a celebrity publicist, to drop his case in return for even more compensation, Mr. Clifford said. He was paid to provide story tips to the paper — a deal he said totaled £1 million.

Beyond Mr. Mulcaire’s files, another likely source of information about hacking by The News of the World is its internal e-mails.

Even as the company faced a flood of claims over the past several years, News International has acknowledged that it did not take any steps to preserve e-mails that might contain evidence of hacking until late last fall. When The News of the World moved offices late last year, the computer used by Mr. Edmondson was destroyed in what the company describes as a standard procedure.

The company asserted in court that a vast amount of its e-mails from 2005 and 2006 — believed to be the height of the hacking activity — had been lost. Company officials blamed bungling, not conspiracy, for the erasures.

News International has subsequently acknowledged that some messages might be recoverable on backup disks, and the police are trying to recover that information now, said Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament. Last year, a forensic computer specialist that the company hired to help it comply with a court order to turn over documents made a surprising discovery: three e-mails sent to Mr. Edmondson containing PIN codes that could allow access to voice mail, as well as names and telephone numbers, one official said.

The paper fired Mr. Edmonson and turned over the e-mails to the police. Those e-mails were a factor in the decision to open a new Scotland Yard inquiry into hacking, according to the inquiry’s leader, Sue Akers. Mr. Edmondson referred questions to his lawyer, who did not respond.

In April, the police arrested Mr. Edmondson, along with Mr. Thurlbeck. A few days later, News International issued a blanket apology, saying, “It is now apparent that our previous inquiries failed to uncover important evidence.”

News International has for years said a 2007 internal investigation showed that hacking was not widespread, but recent interviews with company officials indicate that the inquiry had a different purpose. It was aimed at defending the company from a lawsuit filed by , the paper’s royalty reporter who had been fired for hacking. He claimed that the dismissal was unfair because others were hacking as well, according to two company officials with direct knowledge.

, who succeeded Mr. Coulson as editor of The News of the World, told Parliament in 2007 that News International had turned over as many as 2,500 e-mails to the law firm of Harbottle & Lewis, which the company had retained in the matter. In a letter to Parliament at the time, the firm said it did not find anything in the e-mails linking hacking to three top editors — Mr. Coulson, and Mr. Edmondson.

But a company official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the 2,500 e-mails given to the law firm related only to Mr. Goodman and represented only a small portion of the company’s e-mail traffic.

Since Scotland Yard began its new investigation in January, with access to more internal documents, all three of the editors, who are no longer at the paper, have been arrested.

Two company officials said the 2007 internal inquiry was in fact overseen by , then executive chairman of News International and who resigned Friday as chief executive of . Mr. Hinton told Parliament in 2007 that Mr. Myler “went through thousands of e-mails.” But Mr. Myler was not given direct access to the e-mails, the company officials said. Mr. Hinton did not respond to a message, but in a statement announcing his resignation, he said he “was ignorant of what apparently happened.”

While the e-mails reviewed for the internal inquiry in 2007 showed no direct evidence of hacking, according to three company officials they did contain suggestions that Mr. Coulson may have authorized payments to the police for information. Yet News International turned over those documents to the police in recent months, prompting yet another investigation, this one into possible police bribery.

It is not clear who at News International saw the e-mails in question, or whether the law firm flagged them. The firm, citing client confidentiality obligations, declined to comment, as did the News Corporation.

More recently, as lawsuits and arrests mounted, dissension grew inside News International, interviews show.

After Mr. Edmondson was fired and arrested, Ms. Brooks pressed to pay him a monthly stipend, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction. After an internal disagreement, the payments were moved from the newsroom budget to News International’s. The company put other journalists on paid leave after their arrests, reasoning that they were innocent until proved guilty, a company spokesperson said.

By the middle of last year, News International’s lawyers and some executives were urging that the company accept some responsibility, said two officials with direct knowledge. Ms. Brooks disagreed, according to three people who described the internal debate. “Her behavior all along has been resist, resist, resist,” said one company official.

Over the last several months, Ms. Brooks spearheaded a strategy that seemed designed to spread the blame across Fleet Street, interviews show. Several former News of the World journalists said that she asked them to dig up evidence of hacking. One said in an interview that Ms. Brooks’s target was not her own newspapers, but her rivals.

Mr. Dacre, the editor of The Daily Mail, told his senior managers that he had received several reports from businesspeople, soccer stars and public relations agencies that two News International executives, Will Lewis and Simon Greenberg, had encouraged them to investigate whether their phones had been hacked by Daily Mail newspapers.

“They thought it was unfair that all the focus was on The News of the World,” said one News International official with knowledge of the effort. The two men have told colleagues they did not make such calls, but two company officials disputed that.

Mr. Dacre confronted Ms. Brooks over breakfast at the plush Brown’s hotel. “You are trying to tear down the entire industry,” Mr. Dacre told her, according to an account he relayed to his management team.

Ms. Brooks, known for her tenacity, was not deterred. At a dinner party, Lady Rothermere, the wife of the billionaire owner of The Daily Mail, overheard Ms. Brooks saying that The Mail was just as culpable as The News of the World. “We didn’t break the law,” Lady Rothermere said, according to two sources with knowledge of the exchange. Ms. Brooks asked who Lady Rothermere thought she was, “ ?”

The scandal that smoldered for years ignited this month with news reports that the tabloid had hacked into the messages of , a missing 13-year-old girl who was subsequently discovered murdered. Ms. Brooks, who was News of the World’s editor during the Dowler hacking, issued an apology, saying that she would be appalled “if the accusations are true.”

In the last two weeks, a series of leaks landed in other British news media that appeared intended to shift blame from News International’s current leadership and onto Mr. Coulson and the Metropolitan Police. According to political aides and News Corporation executives, the leaks most likely came from within the company.

Leaks to The Sunday Times, the , and outlets like Mr. Greenberg’s former employer, The London Evening Standard, gave details of Mr. Coulson’s alleged payments to the police and blamed previous News International management.

Mr. Greenberg did not respond directly to messages seeking comment. But a News International spokeswoman referred reporters to a statement from Ms. Akers, the head of the police investigation, praising him and Mr. Lewis for their cooperation with the police.

The Metropolitan Police said it was “extremely concerned” that the release of selected information “known by a small number of people” present at meetings between News International and the police “could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.”

Late last week, Rupert Murdoch told The that the News Corporation had handled the situation “extremely well in every way possible,” except for a few “minor mistakes.”

This weekend, as Mr. Murdoch was coached to face Parliament on Tuesday by a team of lawyers and public relations experts, a full-page advertisement from the News Corporation appeared in every major British newspaper. “We are sorry,” it said.
480 2011-07-19 BANGKOK — The top judicial body of the United Nations on Monday sought to defuse tensions at a Southeast Asian flash point, ordering Cambodia and Thailand to withdraw troops from a disputed temple and establishing a demilitarized zone along their mountainous border.

The two countries have fought each other numerous times in recent years near Preah Vihear, an ancient hilltop temple that stirs nationalist sentiments in both countries.

The court order to “immediately withdraw” military personnel from around the temple was an international legal obligation “with which both Parties were required to comply,” according to a statement released by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Judges at the United Nations court ruled, 11 to 5, in favor of the withdrawal and established a demilitarized zone approximately 4.5 miles by 2.5 miles.

Thailand’s acting foreign minister, Kasit Piromya, told reporters in The Hague that the Thai government would comply with the order. “We are satisfied that the withdrawal of troops is applicable to both Cambodia and Thailand,” he said, according to the Reuters news agency.

Cambodia’s foreign minister, Hor Namhong, praised the decision, Reuters reported. “This map means there will be a permanent cease-fire,” he said. “It will be tantamount to the cessation of aggression of Thailand against Cambodia.”

Despite the ruling, a resolution to the conflict still seems far off.

The long-running border dispute has been poisoned by domestic politics in both Thailand and Cambodia. One political faction in Thailand accused the other of selling out to Cambodia, a historical rival.
481 2011-07-19 “The euro zone crisis has recently worsened significantly, exacerbated by disagreements between the E.U.’s key politicians,” said Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group in . “It is becoming increasingly clear that there will have to be major steps towards fiscal union or the euro zone will begin to disintegrate.”

Investors also remained wary about events in the , where is trying to get lawmakers to agree to a deficit-reducing package before an Aug. 2 deadline for increasing the .

“People are very concerned about the length of the process in the debt-ceiling debate,” said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial, adding that there were also concerns about contagion in the euro zone debt crisis.

On Wall Street, financial shares, which fell more than 1.3 percent, led the broader market down. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 94.57 points, or 0.76 percent, to 12,385.16.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 10.70 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,305.44, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 24.69 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,765.11.

Bond prices were also down. The ’s 10-year note declined 6/32, to 101 21/32. The yield rose to 2.93 percent, from 2.91 percent late Friday.

In the United States, the , which is in the midst of a deepening scandal, fell more than 4 percent, to $14.97. Banks fell, with down 1.67 percent, to $37.74, and down 2.8 percent, to $9.72. But some analysts said that Europe was the main driver of the down market. Some relatively positive corporate earnings, however, helped offset the negative sentiment in the United States.

“I think it is kind of a tug of war,” said James W. Paulsen, the chief strategist for Wells Capital Management. “You look at Europe, and then we are in the midst of a pretty good earnings seasons.”

But analysts also noted a flight to precious metals, including gold, as the reverberations from Europe and the debt talks were gauged against the bigger picture of an uneven economic recovery.

The price of gold for September delivery rose above $1,600 an ounce, as investors sought safer assets. And crude oil rose $1.35 a barrel, to $96.25.

Economists for reported after the market closed on Friday that they were cutting their outlook for real United States economic growth in the near term, to 1.5 percent in the second quarter from 2 percent, and to 2.5 percent in the third quarter from 3.25 percent.

further clouding the picture were the stress tests on the region’s carried out by regulators. Of the 90 banks tested, eight failed, with an aggregate capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros. But the exercise left unanswered many questions about how many healthier lenders would survive a deepening of the debt crisis, given their exposure to Greek, Italian and Spanish bonds. A sovereign default case was excluded from the tests.

The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark index of blue-chip stocks in the region, closed down 1.98 percent on Monday, and the CAC 40 in lost 2.04 percent.

497 2011-07-20 Taliban spokesmen denied reports sent through their e-mail and in text messages early Wednesday that their movement’s leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was dead, saying that their Web sites and telephones had been hacked. Zabiullah Mujahid, one of the spokesmen, reached by telephone, said: “The enemy hijacked our telephone numbers and e-mails. They have sent out false texts and statements about death of Mullah Omar. In reality he is alive and in good condition.”

The e-mail message said he had died of a heart attack and named his successor. Mr. Mujahid added that Mullah Omar was in Afghanistan, but military and intelligence sources have said they believe that he is in Pakistan, most likely in Karachi. A second Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, also denied the reports.

Her visit, her second as secretary of state, came a week after three bombs ripped through heavily populated areas of Mumbai, killing 19 people.
499 2011-07-20 And like Rupert, Keith’s heart, or as one Australian writer put it, “what he would have called his heart,” was drawn to brash tabloids.

As a young journalist during World War I, Keith Murdoch became famous when he visited the Gallipoli campaign and broke censorship rules barring any criticism of the conduct of war or tally of casualty figures. He wrote home to the Australian prime minister, a family friend, and he sneaked off to London to blow the whistle there — in a jingoistic, exaggerated way his son would appreciate — about the incompetence of the British command in charge of the decimation in , where 120,000 soldiers died, including 8,500 Australian infantry and light horsemen.

Old posters for the brilliant 1981 movie give Rupert Murdoch a producing . He financed half the movie to show the world why his father had been right.

Rupert wanted to avenge his father with the British establishment, and what sweeter way to do it than to take over the British press, including its most prestigious broadsheet, The Times of London, and help decide who runs .

At Tuesday’s hearing before a parliamentary committee, Murdoch smiled as he admitted that he sometimes had to go in the backdoor of 10 Downing Street to have tea with a grateful prime minister. But even the backdoor may be barred to him now. And, as the scandal creeps up the trellis of British power, who knows now how long it will be ’s home?

The hunters became the hunted during three hours of riveting testimony in the House of Commons. The trio, baked in the bottom-feeding and whatever-it-takes business, seemed coached. They would say whatever it takes. They stuck to a hoary formula for scandals, claiming the cognitive advantage that being on top of the world left them out of touch.

Mistakes were made, but not by the captains of the ship. We deeply regret these things we were in no way involved in. We’re transparent, even though we’re still paying off former employees to keep their mouths shut.

Playing the ruthless mogul reduced to helpless victim, Rupert came across better than his 38-year-old son , with the Haldeman buzz cut, the American Harvard dropout accent, the skinny blue tie, and the ingratiating over-articulateness hiding the arrogant entitlement.

, the 43-year-old former editor of The News of the World and daughter-figure to Rupert, was a prideful pre-Raphaelite Medusa, with a sweet face and soft voice spinning tales of innocence that didn’t quite gel.

At hearings revealing their corruption, the police revealed their incompetence, unable to stop a lame comedian from further victimizing their self-professed victim.

Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids pandered to the lowest common denominator, but, in the end, his sleazy henchmen were lower than the people they pandered to. People had a limit, as it turned out. Citizen Murdoch was brought low, his grip loosened and his myth deflated, by the power of social opprobrium.

His most revealing moment was when he volunteered his admiration of , calling it the most “open and clear society in the world.” Its leaders are so lavishly paid, he said, that “there’s no temptation, and it is the cleanest society you’d find anywhere.”

It was instructive that Murdoch chose to praise a polished, deeply authoritarian police state. Maybe that’s how corporations would live if they didn’t have to believe in people.
500 2011-07-20 HARRISBURG, Pa. — The City Council in this financially struggling city rejected a statesponsored recovery program on Tuesday, in an act of rebellion against state and county officials who had repeatedly pressured the city to accept it.

The Council voted 4 to 3 against the plan, which was pushed by Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, who has argued that passing it was an essential step in putting Harrisburg’s financial house in order and meeting its obligations to its bondholders.

Opponents said the plan was a raw deal for taxpayers, who would end up paying the bill for a troubled trash incinerator whose more than $300 million in debt payments are more than quadruple the city’s annual budget.

The plan proposed selling city property, namely a valuable parking garage system, as well as the incinerator, freezing wages, and changing contracts with public workers, moves that opponents said would put too much burden on taxpayers and too little on bondholders and banks.

“The bondholders took a risk, ladies and gentlemen,” said Councilwoman Susan Brown-Wilson, who voted against the plan. “When you take a risk on Wall Street, guess what? Sometimes it’s a loss.”
501 2011-07-20 A lawyer who helped to plot a $100 million securities fraud scheme that sold fundamentally worthless stocks to a series of investors, including Yale University, was convicted of grand larceny on Tuesday, prosecutors said.

The lawyer, James W. Margulies, cheated investors while living a lavish life that included traveling on private jets and buying a $350,000 diamond ring for his wife, Manhattan prosecutors said.

Mr. Margulies, 47, will face up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced next month in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.

“The defendant’s pump-and-dump scheme artificially inflated stock prices before he sold off the shares, leaving honest investors holding worthless stock,” Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement after a jury convicted Mr. Margulies on 30 criminal counts. Mr. Vance noted that the victims included a teachers’ pension fund in Ohio and a Methodist church.

Manhattan prosecutors said the case was significant because securities fraud cases of that size are rare in state court.
502 2011-07-20 Mr. Steinweiss preferred metaphor to literalism, and his covers often used collages of musical and cultural symbols. For a Bartok piano concerto, he rejected a portrait of Bartok, using instead the hammers, keys and strings of a piano placed against a stylized backdrop. For a recording of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” he used an illustration of a piano on a dark blue field illuminated only by an abstract street lamp, with a stylized silhouetted skyline in the background.

Alex Steinweiss was born March 24, 1917, in Brooklyn. His father, a women’s shoe designer from Warsaw, and his mother, a seamstress from Riga, Latvia, emigrated to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and eventually settled in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.

On the strength of his high school portfolio, Mr. Steinweiss earned a scholarship to the Parsons School of Design. After graduation he worked for three years for the Austrian poster designer Joseph Binder, whose flat color and simplified human figures were popular at the time and influenced his own work.

During World War II Mr. Steinweiss became Columbia’s advertising manager. He left for a job at the Navy’s Training and Development Center in New York City, where he produced teaching materials and cautionary posters.

After the war, Mr. Steinweiss freelanced for Columbia. During one lunch meeting there, the company’s president, Ted Wallerstein, introduced him to an innovation that the company was about to unveil: the long-playing record. But there was a problem. The heavy, folded kraft paper used to protect 78 r.p.m. records left marks on the vinyl microgroove when 33 1/3 r.p.m. LPs were stacked.

Mr. Steinweiss was asked to develop a jacket for the new format and, with help from his brother-in-law, found a manufacturer willing to invest about $250,000 in equipment. Mr. Steinweiss had the original patent for what became the industry packaging standard (he did not develop the inner sleeve, only the outer package), but under his contract with Columbia he had to waive all rights to any inventions made while working there.

Mr. Steinweiss left the music business at 55, when he realized his design ideas were out of step with the rock era. He turned to his own art, making ceramic bowls and pots and later paintings, often with a musical theme. In 1974 he and his wife moved to Sarasota.

Mr. Steinweiss’s wife of 71 years, Blanche, died in 2010. In addition to his son, of Brooklyn, he is survived by a daughter, Hazel Steinweiss of Sarasota; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

Mr. Steinweiss said he was destined to be a commercial artist. In high school he marveled at his classmates who “could take a brush, dip it in some paint and make letters,” he recalled. “So I said to myself, if some day I could become a good sign painter, that would be terrific!”
503 2011-07-20 Inside the company, executives seemed relieved at how relatively smoothly the process went.

“No one is despondent, no one thinks this went poorly,” said one person briefed on Tuesday’s events who asked not to be identified revealing private conversations. “I wouldn’t bet against those two.”

The day was not without its moments of anxiety for News Corporation executives and the team of outside personnel who spent the weekend preparing the Murdochs for their testimony. Both men expected to deliver opening statements. But just minutes before the hearing began, they were informed that no such remarks would be permitted.

The elder Murdoch’s headline remark from the hearing — that Tuesday was “the most humble day of my life” — was actually part of the scripted statement he had hoped to make. The News Corporation released the statement while Mr. Murdoch was still testifying. And Mr. Murdoch spoke it in full at the very end of the hearing.

Mr. Murdoch did appear to be thrown off in the beginning, struggling to complete his thoughts and pausing often as he spoke — a loss of orientation that some in his inner circle attributed to his surprise over not being allowed to deliver introductory remarks. But as the afternoon wore on, he appeared more collected. The same was true of his son.

Analysts noted that the market was watching James in particular, looking for signs of whether the man who is presumed to be the chief executive heir apparent was up to the task.

“It was a credibility-building day for James,” Mr. Bank said. “I don’t know that it makes succession by him any more definite, but it prevented what could have been the event of making it far less likely.”

And the market appeared to like what it saw. “Every time James spoke, the stock ticked up,” Mr. Bank added.

The elder Murdoch was being carefully watched by analysts who had been critical of his recent decisions at News Corporation and who have argued that he should step down as chief executive to remove the financial drag his leadership is causing the stock. Instead, Mr. Murdoch took the opportunity to reassert his control of the company.

When he was asked by Louise Mensch, a Conservative lawmaker, if he had ever considered resigning. “No,” he said emphatically.

“Because I feel that people that I trusted let me down, I think that they behaved disgracefully,” he said. “Frankly, I am the best person to clean this up.”

Even the attack by a pie-wielding assailant on the elder Murdoch seemed to work in his favor. After a 15-minute break in which the assailant was taken away by the police, Rupert Murdoch reappeared at the witness table in shirtsleeves and the dynamic in the room and on the cable channels covering the hearing live shifted in his favor.

The company still faces a reckoning on multiple fronts — in the British and American legal systems, on Wall Street and in the court of public opinion — that threatens its reputation and certainly its future in the newspapers. Reuters reported Tuesday night that the company’s independent directors had hired two prominent lawyers, former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, to advise them.

Though Mr. Murdoch may have outperformed many expectations on Tuesday, he showed signs of strain at times.

Martin Dunn, a former News Corporation executive who most recently edited a rival newspaper, The Daily News in New York, said the elder Mr. Murdoch seemed tired, stressed and “a little beaten up” by the hearing process.

“It must be very hard, at 80 years of age, after spending four decades building up a company, to find yourself under attack in what is an unprecedented way,” Mr. Dunn said of the elder Mr. Murdoch. “I think that showed.”
504 2011-07-20 He also earned renown for downloading nearly 20 million pages of court documents for a project that put them free online. That brought Mr. Swartz under federal investigation. He was not indicted but later published the resulting F.B.I. file online.

He faces up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines for charges related to wire fraud, computer fraud and unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer. He surrendered to the authorities on Tuesday morning, was arraigned in Federal District Court and pleaded not guilty to all counts. He was released on $100,000 unsecured bond.

Institutions like colleges and libraries pay for access to JSTOR, which is then available free to their users. Supporters were quick to defend Mr. Swartz. David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, an activist group that Mr. Swartz founded, said in a statement that the arrest “makes no sense,” comparing the indictment to “trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.” An online petition gathered 15,000 signatures in just a few hours.

In an interview, Mr. Segal said that his comments went to the principle, not to anything Mr. Swartz might have done in obtaining the documents.

“I know him as a person who cares deeply about matters of ethics and government,” Mr. Segal said. “I don’t know about the matter of what has been alleged.”

Beginning in September of last year, according to the indictment, Mr. Swartz used several methods to grab articles, even breaking into a computer-wiring closet on the M.I.T. campus and setting up a laptop with a false identity on the school network for free JSTOR access under the name Gary Host — or when shortened for the e-mail address, “ghost.” When retrieving the computer, he hid his face behind a bicycle helmet, peeking out through the ventilation holes.

The flood of downloads was so great that it crashed some JSTOR servers, the indictment stated, and JSTOR blocked access to the network from M.I.T. and its users for several days.

Ultimately Mr. Swartz returned the hard drives containing the articles to JSTOR and promised that the material would not be disseminated.

“We are not pursuing further action,” the organization’s general counsel, Nancy Kopans, said; the organization said in a statement that the criminal case “has been directed by the United States Attorney’s Office.”

As for the comments from Mr. Swartz’s supporters that he had done nothing wrong, however, Ms. Kopans said, “It’s an unfortunate situation, but I think the facts speak for themselves.”

Mr. Swartz recently completed a 10-month fellowship at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard. “Aaron has never done anything in this context for personal gain — this isn’t a hacking case, in the sense of someone trying to steal credit cards,” said Lawrence Lessig, the center’s director. “That’s something JSTOR saw, and the government obviously didn’t.”

In a statement announcing the charges, a United States attorney, Carmen M. Ortiz, said: “Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.”

Carl Malamud, an online activist who worked with Mr. Swartz on the court-documents project, called Mr. Swartz “one of the Internet’s most talented programmers,” but said that “the JSTOR situation is very disturbing.”

In an e-mail exchange with a reporter, Mr. Malamud, who is engaged in a project intended to put all laws and government documents online, said: “My style, when I see a gate barring entry and that gate is sanctioned by the law, is to go up to that gate and pound on it hard and force them to open up. Others sometimes look for a back door.”

He added, “I’m not convinced that style is always effective, and it is certainly often dangerous.”
505 2011-07-20 Johnson & Johnson posted a 20 percent decline in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, hurt by product recalls, flat sales in the United States and costs related to litigation and restructuring.

Johnson & Johnson executives said they were making progress on fixing manufacturing problems that resulted in several recalls and had numerous new drugs, medical devices and toiletries hitting the market or coming soon.

The company said it earned $2.78 billion, or $1 a share, down from $3.45 billion, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8.3 percent, to $16.6 billion, from $15.33 billion a year ago.

Excluding one-time items, income would have been $3.55 billion, or $1.28 a share.

Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.24 a share and sales of $16.21 billion. Shares of Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., fell 37 cents, to $66.72.

“The expectations were austere,” said Steve Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities. He noted that J.& J. executives repeatedly cited pressures from austerity measures by European government health programs and flat or declining prices in the United States for things like joint replacements.
506 2011-07-20 In recent weeks, police in Britain and the Netherlands have arrested several people suspected of having participated in those attacks. Justice Department officials said British and Dutch police also made related arrests on Tuesday. FoxNews.com reported Tuesday that the police in London had arrested a 16-year-old boy who they believed was a core member of LulzSec and used the alias Tflow.

The arrests of suspected Anonymous supporters in the United States were among the first known in this country.

Ross W. Nadel, a former federal prosecutor who founded the computer hacking and intellectual property unit at the Federal District Court in San Jose, said the arrests could be “a highly visible form of deterrence.”

The prosecution is expected to face at least two major challenges, said Jennifer Granick, a San Francisco-based lawyer who specializes in computer crimes and has defended hackers in the past. Because hackers often use aliases and other people’s computers when they carry out attacks, prosecutors will have to prove that those arrested “were the ones with their fingers on the keyboard,” she said.

Second, the conspiracy charge could be especially difficult to prove, given that Anonymous boasts of being leaderless and free-floating. “When you have a decentralized group,” Ms. Granick said, “the question is, Are there big fish, and are any of these people big fish?”

The charge of “intentional damage to a protected computer” is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Cyberattacks are made possible by a combination of two features of the Internet economy. Poor security at many companies and agencies makes sensitive government and private data vulnerable to breaches. And mounting an attack is inexpensive and, with the right skills, relatively simple.

In the San Jose case, all 14 suspects are accused of using a free program called Low Orbit Ion Cannon to hurl large packets of data at PayPal’s site with the intention of overwhelming it.

With the exception of one suspect, whose name was redacted by the court for reasons that federal officials did not explain, those arrested were identified by their real names and nicknames, ranging from Anthrophobic to Toxic to MMMM. Most were in their 20s, and just three were above the age of 30. It is unclear if any of them knew one another.
507 2011-07-20 Sonos aims its products at music enthusiasts, the kind of people who are willing to travel out of town to see their favorite bands in concert. They tend to want a state-of-the-art home music system that lets them listen to music files on their PC, with online radio and streaming services like Rhapsody, Pandora and Spotify, the European music service that premiered last week in the United States.

Sonos, founded in 2002, has won a loyal following over the years for its sound systems. Globally, around 300,000 households have Sonos, with sales split between the United States and Europe. To create the wireless network, one speaker must be plugged into the home’s Internet router. It is also possible to buy a small box called a “bridge,” which costs $49, and plug that into the router instead.

Its ease of use has created an appetite that is driving rapid growth of the company. Revenue is expected to nearly double this year to $250 million. Profit will most likely be modest as surplus cash is reinvested into the business, the company said. Until now, Sonos, a private company based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has kept its financial details closely guarded. To reach a wider market, Sonos is also trying to simplify its marketing. Some of its messaging was awkward, like product names that seemed more like serial numbers.

“Wireless hi-fi system” is the company’s new tagline on its Web site, replacing one that sounds as if it were written by engineers, the “wireless multiroom music system.”

The speaker packaging was also made over so that the box does not resemble a toaster oven. Sonos speakers now come in a black box with a sleek image of the unit and minimal text instead of being plastered with a detailed explanation of the product and installation.

Mr. MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, is confident that the shift to wireless systems is inevitable. “Our view was home stereo systems were great for the 20th century, but they aren’t going to be for what comes next,” Mr. MacFarlane said.

“We want to be the Bose of the digital age,” said Tom Cullen, a Sonos co-founder.

Sonos is a bright spot in an industry that is otherwise stagnant. Consumers are not buying costly audio systems in the digital era, as did the analog generation. Home audio system sales in the United States grew just 1 percent during the preceding 12 months to $2.51 billion, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.

Instead, people are listening to music on their smartphones and iPods without buying expensive stereo consoles and CD players.

As more people think about wireless speakers, Sonos faces more competition from Sony’s HomeShare, Best Buy’s Rocketfish and Logitech’s Squeezebox. Some manufacturers have created light bulbs for recessed ceiling fixtures that have wireless speakers inside.

One such speaker system, MusicLites, made in partnership with the audio company Artison and the lighting firm Orsam Sylvania, made its debut last month.

Aaron Levine, product manager for Sony’s HomeShare, acknowledged that Sonos has a head start in the field given its years of focusing on wireless speakers.

But it remains early, he said, and many consumers are still unaware of wireless, multiroom music systems. “For Sony, this is definitely the direction we’re moving in with proliferation of connected devices in the living room,” Mr. Levine said.

Ross Rubin, an analyst with NPD, said that Sonos would appeal to more people with its cheaper speaker. But there is a limit to the market, he said. A multiroom music system is unnecessary for many apartment dwellers.

Moreover, he said that Sonos remained costly compared with some alternatives that people might already own, like Blu-ray players, which can stream music from a PC.

“Compared with that, Sonos is relatively expensive,” Mr. Rubin said.
508 2011-07-20 Officials involved in talks on the new Greek rescue package said that in recent days the debate had moved beyond Greece, and that markets were now questioning the very architecture of the euro, a common currency for sovereign nations with diverse economic and fiscal problems.

“For Spain and Italy, you need to provide a solution for Greece, plus a safety net to prevent contagion,” said Antonio Garcia Pascual, chief southern European economist for Barclays Capital. “But the inaction of policy makers is unhelpful. And we don’t have weeks. It’s a matter of days, especially with Italian and Spanish bonds at this level.”

Until recently, the argument was that any Greek restructuring or default would bring a market frenzy aimed at other countries in difficulty. Instead, the failure to cope with the reality of Greek insolvency has had the opposite effect, causing more contagion, many analysts say.

“To see those yields on highly developed countries like Italy jump so fast has really focused minds,” said Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Center for European Reform in London. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has insisted that there is little urgency and that the private sector must be involved in restructuring.

“Merkel is now in a very difficult position,” Mr. Tilford said. “The Germans are now alive to the risk in ways they weren’t before. For all the derision about Silvio Berlusconi, Italy is core Europe and has very strong ties to Germany and France.”

But those pressing for a comprehensive solution may be disappointed, with Mrs. Merkel saying on Tuesday that “a spectacular, single step cannot responsibly be made, including on Thursday.” Instead, she said, “we need a controlled and manageable process of successive steps and measures” for “reducing debt and improving competitiveness.”

European technocrats are reportedly exploring a tax on euro zone banks to cover burden-sharing by the private sector. They are also said to be considering a supposedly voluntary “rollover” of existing bonds for ones with a lower interest rate and a much longer maturity, preserving, at least notionally, the face value of the bond. That idea, originally French, might not be judged a “default” by all ratings agencies.

For 18 months, as Greece struggled to push through austerity measures, the “D word” — default — was taboo. But last Thursday, Greece’s finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, for the first time openly discussed the prospect of a “selective default” in the Greek Parliament.

Finance Ministry officials insisted that “selective default” was simply a rating-agency term for any plan that includes the private sector; the opposition immediately accused the government of trying to bankrupt the country.

But many analysts say Mr. Venizelos took a new step toward acknowledging reality. “The point of departure cannot be any more to insist on Greece repaying full maturity on the bonds it owns,” said Jens Bastian, an economist at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens. “Some call it a selective default, some call it a rollover, some call it a debt exchange, some call it a re-profiling. But obviously no one in their right mind accepts that Greece is going to repay on time in full.”

That recent awareness is frightening in Greece, Mr. Bastian said, because the government has not readied the ground for what it might mean.

Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank, has been adamant that he will not accept any kind of default or “credit event” over Greece. He argues that all obligations of a euro zone member must be met or the markets will attack every highly indebted country in turn. But that is happening anyway, and few believe that he is under any illusion about Greece.

What he wants, the analysts said, is a comprehensive solution that protects the central bank’s balance sheet from a markdown in Greek debt and recapitalizes commercial banks exposed to Greece — inevitably with more taxpayer money.

But the need to inject more public money is exactly what Germany and its allies, like the Netherlands, do not want to do, because critics will charge that recapitalization would represent a “transfer” of funds to undeserving countries. So politicians will have to settle on a mechanism for addressing the concerns of the central bank, their own commercial banks, as well as the growing wariness among taxpayers to bailouts.

“The market is far more intelligent and resilient than a lot of politicians realize,” said Lee C. Buchheit, a lawyer who has handled sovereign defaults. “Investors realize that sometimes you make money and sometimes you don’t. But they can’t abide prolonged uncertainty.”
509 2011-07-20 DETROIT — Nissan Motor said Tuesday that it was raising the price of the Leaf electric car by several thousand dollars as it prepared to offer the vehicle with additional features in 21 new states by the end of the year.

Nissan said the 2012 Leaf, which goes on sale in the fall, will cost at least $2,450 more than the 2011 model, but perform better in colder climates, with features like a battery warmer, heated seats and a heated steering wheel. The Leaf’s starting price will be $36,050, including destination charges, and monthly lease payments will climb $20, to $369.

Meanwhile, General Motors is dropping the price of the Leaf’s chief competition, the Chevrolet Volt, by about $1,000 for the 2012 model year, to $39,995. Most buyers of the Leaf and Volt qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit.

The price changes will reduce the gap between the two cars by more than half. The Volt is more expensive largely because it includes an engine that functions as a gasoline-powered generator and extends the car’s range.

In the first half of 2011, Nissan sold 3,875 of the Leaf in the United States, compared with Volt sales of 2,745, though the difference was more a result of production constraints than demand. Both vehicles have been selling nearly as soon as they arrive at dealerships, and the companies are working to increase output. G.M. has fewer than 100 Volts in inventory, Rob Peterson, a company spokesman, said.

By year’s end, the Leaf will be available in 28 states, and G.M. says the Volt will be available nationwide.
510 2011-07-20 By Saturday, 22 shipping containers in an array of colors will be in place for the opening of Dekalb Market, a collection of food, clothing and other retailers in Downtown Brooklyn that will be open year-round.

Ten food vendors have signed one-year leases for the 160-square-foot containers, some open on the long side with a counter and others open on one end. They are: Cheeky Sandwiches from the Lower East Side; Cuzin’s Duzin, a doughnut shop from Albee Square Mall that was where the market is now being installed; Maharlika, for prepared Filipino food; Mazie’s Bites, a soul food caterer; Nile Valley Eco-Juice and Salad Bar for vegan food; Pasticcio, which once had two Italian restaurants, one in Manhattan and the other in Queens; the Tea Box, an online retailer; Joe, the coffee cafe; Robicelli’s cupcakes; and Sour Puss Pickles, Brooklyn purveyors that are regular street-market denizens. (Allison Robicelli, pictured, painted her container the other day.)

A series of flourishing vegetable gardens line the Willoughby Street side of the area, where tomatoes, squash, chard, collards, Asian greens, corn, kale, peppers, carrots, amaranth and more are being grown. Each plot is maintained by a different community group, including Malcolm X Grassroots, which will distribute the crops to low-income areas, and New York City College of Technology around the corner, which will use the garden to supply its restaurant run by culinary students. Behind the garden there will be a kitchen and classroom, and in the center of the market, a tent with picnic tables.

The market is the first permanent American installation by Urban Space, a company founded in London in 1979 that has more than 20 container projects in Britain. In New York the company has set up temporary holiday markets at Madison Square, Union Square and Columbus Circle.

Dekalb Market is about a square block, at 332 Flatbush Avenue Extension, bordered by Willoughby Street and Gold Street, north of the Fulton Mall in Brooklyn. All vendors will be open daily from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and some will be open as early as 8 a.m., and stay open as late as midnight. The market will have four entrances; dekalbmarket.com.
511 2011-07-20 Apple did not offer precise figures on how many companies used its phone and tablet, but it gave examples of several — Nestlé, Comcast and Crédit Agricole among them — that used the iPhone in their workplaces, and others — Alaska Airlines, Nordstrom — that used the iPad. Apple also said 86 percent of Fortune 500 companies were either testing or deploying the iPad for use in their offices.

In China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Apple said, sales of all its products grew nearly six times from a year ago.

The iPhone continued to be in high demand, with 20.34 million sold worldwide, more than double the number from the same quarter a year earlier.

The gain came even though an update to the phone is expected later this year, presumably causing some potential customers to postpone buying until the new model, the iPhone 5, becomes available.

Sales of iPads nearly tripled to 9.25 million worldwide as Apple increased production and started clearing a backlog of orders dating from the March introduction of the new version, the iPad 2.

Apple executives had blamed limited manufacturing capacity for the initial shortage.

“Sales of iPad 2 have absolutely been a frenzy,” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a conference call with analysts. He added: “We sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make. Certainly there was no shortage of demand.”

Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners, praised Apple’s overall growth and its ability to sell so many iPhones ahead of a product update. By far, it is the best performing of large technology companies, he said.

“At some point, the music ends,” Mr. Gillis said. “But when you look out at least for the next couple of quarters, I don’t see much of a slowdown.”

Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, who is on medical leave, did not participate in the conference call.

A number of companies like Hewlett-Packard and Samsung are trying to get a piece of the tablet market, an important part of the consumer electronics industry. But Apple is expected to remain dominant with a 78 percent share of the global market in 2011, according to eMarketer.

Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported that net income in the fiscal third quarter that ended June 25 more than doubled to $7.31 billion, or $7.79 a share, from $3.25 billion, or $3.51 a share, in the year-ago quarter.

The company said revenue climbed 82 percent, to $28.57 billion, from $15.7 billion.

The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $5.80 a share and revenue of $24.92 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.

Sales of Apple computers did well in the quarter, with a 14 percent gain worldwide to 3.95 million.

The increase far outpaced the modest 2.3 percent industrywide growth during the quarter, as estimated by Gartner, the market research company.

The slow growth in overall computer sales is attributed to a shift by consumers to tablets and cautious spending by corporations. Also, strong growth in the same quarter last year made comparisons difficult.

Apple’s string of growth over the years has made it a darling of investors. The company is now the most valuable in the technology industry, with a market capitalization of nearly $350 billion, dwarfing many of its rivals.

Apple’s market value is more than 10 times Dell’s, for example, and nearly five times Hewlett-Packard’s. In keeping with its usual practice, Apple issued a conservative forecast for the fourth quarter. Revenue will be around $25 billion, the company said, while net profit will be close to $5.50 a share, both well below analyst expectations of $27.7 billion in revenue and $6.42 a share in profit.

In the conference call, analysts pointed out the discrepancy. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, said the company’s forecast took into account the disruption caused by the introduction of a new product, which he would not disclose. That product is widely believed to be the next-generation iPhone.

“We are incredibly confident about our business, our product pipeline and what we are doing,” Mr. Oppenheimer said.
512 2011-07-20 Coca-Cola posted slightly better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday on strength in emerging markets like China and Russia, helping to send its shares up more than 3 percent to a 12-year high.

The company, whose brands include Sprite, Vitaminwater and Powerade, does the majority of its business outside the United States. That has kept it in favor with investors despite home market struggles, where anemic jobs growth has dulled sales of soft drinks.

At the same time, volatility in commodity markets will lead to about $700 million in increased costs this year for things like packaging, sweeteners and fruit.

Coke said it had raised North American prices 1 to 2 percent in the first half of the year, and had already started work on additional increases that should total 2 to 3 percent for the year, even though such moves might lead some budget-conscious consumers to cut back.

“There’s no question that the U.S. consumer is still mixed, confused and somewhat apprehensive,” Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, told Reuters.
513 2011-07-20 Not long ago, Dykstra was the proud owner of an $18.5 million mansion in Thousand Oaks, Calif., which he purchased in 2007 from . But since early June, home has been a Los Angeles County jail in a part of the city with no ocean views and where bail bondsmen storefronts outnumber palm trees.

Dykstra, 48, faces federal charges of bankruptcy fraud and obstruction of justice, along with state charges of identify theft, grand theft auto and possession of drugs. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts and recently boasted to his 5,500-plus followers on , “With your support, I will have my day!”

The promise, alas, was a come-on for financial contributions as Dykstra, who three years ago listed his net worth as $58 million, has been unable to post $500,000 bail and has been appointed a public defender in the federal case.

Even his authenticity on Twitter was suspect: the post was made by Dan Herman, a 26-year-old Phillies fan who idolized Dykstra as a boy, claims to be his business manager and said he was working on a Dykstra documentary to raise money for his legal defense fund. Another Twitter post on Dykstra’s account last week said: “Violence is not the only way of setting fire to the spirit of a people! I feel the human will supports me as it has in wars of the past.”

In a telephone interview, Herman characterized Dykstra as a well-meaning victim of “unscrupulous people” who tried to take advantage of his celebrity and of overzealous law enforcement officials in Los Angeles.

To those who have known him much longer, back to the genesis of Nails, Dykstra’s imprisonment is at least partly a result of a willful recklessness that was celebrated between baseball’s white lines but may have been fated to court disaster outside them.

Even as a player, he came alarmingly close. In May 1991, driving with his Phillies teammate Darren Daulton and with nearly double the legal blood-alcohol limit, Dykstra crashed his speeding car sideways into a tree, seriously injuring both of them. Two months earlier he was placed on a year’s probation by Commissioner after admitting to losing $78,000 in high-stakes poker games in .

Within baseball’s ultracompetitive environment, Dykstra was practically iconic among peers for his take-no-prisoners ferocity, Ojeda said. The demands of the game, he added, left no time to worry about possible long-term behavioral trends and effects.

“The truth was that we despised the guys who worried about their longevity, about getting hurt, and there were more guys with the same attitude as Lenny on our ’86 championship team than with any group I’ve ever been around,” Ojeda said.

“But there eventually is a transition to make, where you learn to self-govern and say, ‘O.K., I’m dealing with normal people now and I can’t play by those rules.’ Obviously, Lenny struggled with that. If he’d learned to listen to other people more and to take no for an answer, he might have headed off some of the trouble he finds himself in now.”

The problem was that Dykstra had long been conditioned to dismiss those who told him he was too small at 5 feet 10 inches and 160 pounds to be a major league center fielder, much less a star. He joined the Mets in 1985, sharing time with , after advancing through the Mets’ minor league system in four years.

“In a sport where we were all hoping we were going to be great, he acted like he knew he was going to be great,” said Ron Darling, also a Mets starting pitcher in those years and a broadcaster now. “He was unlike anyone I’d ever met. We used to think of guys as kind of soft surfer types. Lenny was the opposite, the original skateboard dude, the guy who broke into your house and took a swim in your pool.”

In Class A ball, Dykstra played under his eventual Mets manager, Davey Johnson, who lectured him on the wisdom of hitting line drives, playing small ball. Dykstra heeded the advice for most of his time with the Mets, but by 1993, with Dykstra having gone to in a 1989 trade, his body type changed drastically.

With muscle packed onto muscle, he had career highs in home runs (19) and doubles (44) and was second in the National League’s Most Valuable Player award voting to after leading the Phillies to the World Series.

Injured often throughout his career, Dykstra played his last season in baseball in 1996. He was 33. But few were surprised 11 years later when he was caught in the net cast by baseball’s investigation into anabolic use. Dykstra denied it but his brother Kevin — embittered by Lenny’s divestiture of the car-wash businesses for $51 million and not paid the $4 million he claimed he had been promised — cooperated with the former senator , who headed the investigation.

Kevin Dykstra, a former minor league umpire, told Mitchell that he had been a source of his brother’s recreational and performance-enhancing drugs.

“Lenny’s whole thing was that he always wanted to be bigger, in every way,” Kevin Dykstra said in a telephone interview. “After baseball, he was just never happy with what he had. He had a $4 million house, but he had to get Gretzky’s house. He had nice cars, but he had to have a Maybach. He flew first class, but he wanted his own private jet.”

Wayne Neilsen, who is the brother of Lenny and Kevin Dykstra’s mother, Marilyn, and also worked in the car-wash business, supported Kevin Dykstra’s claim of an equity stake in the business. “He screwed us all out of money,” Neilsen said in a telephone interview. “He didn’t do right by his family and we’ve kind of disowned him.”

By the time of the , Dykstra had moved on to a short-lived prominence as a stock-picking savant with the blessing of of CNBC’s As with Dan Herman and others who hitched themselves to Dykstra during his well-publicized financial rise, Cramer’s fascination would seem to have been at least partly rooted in baseball rooting. He grew up in Philadelphia, and one of his first jobs was selling at Veterans Stadium.

In 2005 Cramer gave Dykstra a stock column on the , a Web site he co-founded. Customers paid $999.95 a year for Dykstra’s advice, which was mixed with baseball aphorisms.

Chris Frankie, another onetime Dykstra and Mets fan, edited the column and said that Dykstra’s market prowess was no fabrication, as some came to believe as his life fell apart.

“I do think Lenny was deceptively smart in a lot of ways,” Frankie said. “He didn’t know everything about every company; he had about 100 that he followed. He had a research assistant. He made picks when I was with him.”

Cramer insisted that Dykstra had legitimate market instincts, as long as he mimicked his baseball career, tried to hit singles and doubles, and didn’t swing for the fences.

“Lenny was doing really well, coming up with some terrific winning ideas,” Cramer wrote in an e-mail. “And then, well, honestly, I don’t know. It’s a sad story.”

Frankie and others who have worked with Dykstra said that his desire to live like a corporate kingpin, his fascination with private jets and his decision in 2008 to publish a glossy magazine intended to financially guide wealthy professional athletes hastened his downfall.

As business became more complex, his behavior became erratic and his relationships more hostile. He badgered employees all hours of the night, disavowed debts and operated on whims. According to Frankie, he frequently spiced conversations with quotations from a favorite movie, ’s

Ron Darling recalled a telephone call from Dykstra about the time he was pitching his magazine, The Players Club, which distributed several issues free to athletes and sports industry executives before going under.

Darling said: “Out of the blue, he said: ‘Dude, I’ve got a pitch in to Why don’t you come over? These guys like you.’ ”

Darling declined, but many did business with Dykstra and soon after regretted it. By July 2009, when he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, he was awash in multiple court actions by creditors as large as the former and as small as an older brother, Brian, who sued him for back pay related to the car washes.

His image and empire disintegrating, bills went unpaid and employees and even prospective employees were saddled with expenses as routine as interviews over dinner. The unluckiest employees were pressured into providing him credit card access with the promise they would be paid back with interest.

“One of the dumbest decisions I ever made, giving him my card information,” said Kevin Coughlin, who left another job to become photo director for The Players Club, in part because Dykstra had been one of his favorite players.

Coughlin said that Dykstra ran up tens of thousands of dollars on his card, including one $32,000 charge for a leased jet from to Helena, Mont., where Dykstra’s son, Cutter, was playing minor league ball. Coughlin worked only 67 days for Dykstra, but it took months to recover the money.

Kevin Dykstra said Lenny used the same credit card ruse on their mother, Marilyn, and alleged that his brother invested, and lost, the $700,000 bonus his son Cutter received when he signed his first professional contract with the organization.

Asked if the family has sympathy for Lenny, or any temptation to visit him in jail, Kevin Dykstra said: “Listen, we were once a really tight family, but we still can’t believe what he did to us. You know, people used to say, oh, there are two sides to every story. Well, the results speak for themselves.”

Kevin Dykstra said he is back to managing car-wash centers. But with three children to support, he lives paycheck to paycheck. “We had a $2 million business,” he said. “Everyone was doing so well.”

It is possible that Lenny Dykstra has similar regrets. He told Davey Johnson in a telephone conversation two years ago that the car washes had been his greatest investment because people would always have cars and no one would ever invent something that would make the business obsolete.

Upon hearing of Dykstra’s other investments, and recalling how Dykstra always raised the stakes from hole to hole during their 1980s golf games even when outclassed, Johnson thought: “He’ll either wind up making a bundle or losing it all.”

He wound up doing both, with prosecutors readying evidence that he ran way afoul of the law in the process.

“You think about what’s happened to Gary Carter, which is a tragedy,” Ojeda said, referring to the former Mets catcher afflicted with inoperable brain . “What’s happened to Lenny was self-induced, yes, but to me it’s also a tragedy.

“I know people may not like to hear that or agree with me, but I believe that at least some of this has to do with chemical reactions in the brain and that there are people who can become addicted to the action, the adrenaline rush, the same way they become addicted to drugs.”

Asked if he also believed that Dykstra’s apparent fate was predictable, Ojeda said: “Absolutely not.”

After a pause, he added: “But would you have said it was unlikely? I don’t know that you would have said that, either.”

531 2011-07-21 Still, for most couples, it is unlikely that two defective genes for the protein, called DEFB126, are enough to prevent pregnancy by themselves. The abnormal gene is very common, it turns out, and the scientists report that about a quarter of all men have two defective copies. Clearly it does not prevent all those men from reproducing.

Many men may be able to “overcome the mutation” because other factors, like the shape, number or mobility of their sperm, help them fertilize the egg, said Dr. Cherr, a professor of environmental toxicology and nutrition at the University of California, Davis. But if those offsetting factors are not so robust, he added, then the mutation may have “a very dramatic impact.”

In the Chinese couples, two abnormal genes appeared to delay pregnancy even when measurements like sperm counts and mobility were taken into account, said Scott Venners, a co-author and professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. He did not say by how much.

The protein is normally secreted by the epididymis, where sperm are stored after they are produced in the testes. Without that protein, sperm were about 20 percent less likely to penetrate the mucus at the entrance of a woman’s cervix and enter her reproductive tract. And Dr. Cherr said sperm without the protein might enter the tract only to be “rapidly dispatched” as “foreign invaders.” The scientists discovered the abnormal gene while exploring the possibility of a male contraceptive, in the form of a vaccine to make men temporarily infertile.

In terms of evolution, the mutation appears to be very old and, besides the 25 percent of men with two mutated copies, half of men have one mutated and one normal copy with no effect on fertility, said Dr. Charles Bevins, a co-author and microbiologist at U.C. Davis. While it seems counterintuitive that a mutation that is so common would be related to preventing the reproduction of a species, Dr. Bevins said the mutation might have survived because it has another function, still unknown but useful.

Some fertility experts said the research was too preliminary to prove that the mutation affects couples’ ability to conceive.

“I don’t know exactly what it means yet,” said Dr. Robert Oates, a urology professor at Boston University School of Medicine and president-elect of the Society for Male Reproduction and Urology. “The science was very, very good. But does it apply to the population I’m seeing in Boston? We don’t know yet.

“The only thing you can say is that it appears in a very young Chinese population that the time to pregnancy is slightly extended.”

But Dolores Lamb, professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine and president-elect for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said “this really is a real thing that they’re looking at,” and “it’s affecting a function of the sperm that I think was given very little attention.”

Dr. Cherr said it would be relatively simple to develop a test for the mutation to be performed in a clinic or at home. Eventually he envisions a treatment, possibly a cream or gel, that would essentially restore the protein to help sperm enter the reproductive tract. For now, he said, if couples find a double mutation, they could avoid some additional expensive fertility testing and undergo fertility treatments that directly inseminate the woman’s egg.

Dr. Lamb said such a test could suggest an even cheaper option.

Since some Chinese couples “were able to achieve pregnancy on their own — it was just taking a longer time,” she said, couples “could simply be told to maybe wait a little longer than a year.”
532 2011-07-21 The critics’ view prevailed, with four of seven City Council members voting against the plan Tuesday night, and on Wednesday, the city started living the answer to Mr. Black’s question.

“It’s a nervous place to be,” said Neil Grover, a lawyer who led the effort against the state plan. “It’s new territory for everybody. No city has ever reached this point.”

The city is indeed in uncharted waters. Steve Kratz, a spokesman for Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development, said that no municipality had ever rejected distressed status, which grants access to state funds in exchange for accepting an outside adviser’s recovery plan. Ms. Thompson now has two weeks to come up with her own plan.

The way Mr. Grover and his allies see it, this city has behaved like a binge borrower, enabled by financiers, using credit cards to pay off credit cards for things it never should have bought. They argue that the latest plan, which called for the sale of city assets like its parking garages, amounted to yet another short-term fix.

“It was throwing Harrisburg to the wolves,” said Eric Papenfuse, a bookstore owner who has been an outspoken critic of the plan. It would have allowed “those who lent money and the politicians who voted for it to escape without accountability and with money in their pockets.”

In an interview, Ms. Thompson said that she would ensure the burden was shared. She said the city had been arguing with itself for two years — it first missed a bond payment in 2009 — and that the plan, which was drawn up by an outside adviser, provided the only realistic roadmap.

“I don’t plan on making any drastic changes,” she said. “I’ve not had anyone show me a better way out of this situation.”

But there is concern that Ms. Thompson’s administration is not strong enough to fashion its own plan. One council member, Patty Kim, even voted to pass the state plan because, “I don’t want to wait for another plan, especially from the mayor,” she said.

Last year, Mr. Grover formed a group, Debt Watch Harrisburg, to bring together like-minded taxpayers who were as exasperated as he was by what he described as years of bad decisions by politicians. It now has about 150 members, he said, and they brought hard questions to public hearings last fall. He says the group’s agenda is not political, though he acknowledged that he once worked on a campaign of one of Ms. Thompson’s opponents. One of the members, a former writing teacher who is also his neighbor, started a Web site, Today’s the Day Harrisburg, where the debt is debated.

“We are the ones who write the check for this at the other end,” Mr. Grover said. “We wanted to have a voice in the process.”

Most of the city’s problems flow from a failed trash incinerator project that has saddled the city with $310 million in debt. The borrowing occurred under the former mayor, Stephen R. Reed, who said in an interview that he felt “outraged” that the project created such a staggering debt burden, but that he had never seen a clear explanation of why the cost had been so underestimated.

“We kept borrowing money to put Band-Aids on it,” said William Cluck, a lawyer who serves on the board of the agency that owns the incinerator. The incinerator’s debts are the subject of at least seven lawsuits against the city, he said. Some residents had been pushing for bankruptcy, as it would freeze those claims, but the state legislature recently banned it as an option until 2012.

Rejecting the plan will cut it off from state funds, and Mr. Cluck said that is something that the city — with about half its property tax exempt, and about a quarter of the residents below poverty level — can ill afford.

“This city is crumbling,” said Corky Goldstein, a resident who spoke on Tuesday. “The people need something. If we vote no, there’s no plan. If there’s no plan, we’re not going to make it.”

Robert Philbin, Ms. Thompson’s spokesman, said the mayor had spent the day talking on the phone, “reassuring stakeholders that there’s not going to be any dramatic change” in the course of action.

The law is unclear, he said, on whether she needs to get approval of the City Council. If so, Ms. Thompson said that passage would “take an act of God.”

“If people face their responsibilities, the city will be in control of its own destiny,” he said.
533 2011-07-21 Quick: Who’s the greatest athlete ever from Luxembourg?

The landlocked country of less than 1,000 square miles (that’s smaller than Rhode Island) and fewer than 500,000 people (that’s smaller than El Paso, Tex.) is not exactly a hothouse of world-class athletes.

There’s Gilles Müller, the 82nd-ranked men’s tennis player. He made it to the quarterfinals of the 2008 United States Open before losing to another player from a peaceful nook of Western Europe, Roger Federer.

Josy Barthel won the country’s only gold medal at a Summer Olympics, in the men’s 1,500 meters at the 1952 Helsinki Games. That’s the last time a Luxembourger stood on a podium at the Summer Games.

The Alpine skier Marc Girardelli delivered two more medals to Luxembourg, both silver, at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. But he was originally from Austria.

Then there was Michel Théato of France, winner of the men’s marathon at the 1900 Olympics in Paris. “I could not have dreamt of a sweeter victory for my pride as a runner and a Frenchman,” Théato said after the race, according to David Wallechinsky’s “The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics.” Théato, however, was born in Luxembourg. So he should count for something.

But to find the greatest of them all, you might have to go back to 1927 and ’28, in the Alps, where Nicolas Frantz outclimbed the competition to win the Tour de France two years in a row.
534 2011-07-21 At most city charter schools, students are selected at public meetings where applicants’ names are picked from a box. But city officials found that at Academic Leadership, which has about 200 children in kindergarten through second grade, hundreds of applicants were left out of this year’s drawing. The lottery was supervised not by an impartial observer, but by a member of the parent association, the letter said. And while students who applied after the lottery should have been added to the waiting list, scores of them were not, it said.

“They are treating it like it’s a private school on the Upper East Side,” said a former school employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “Like people are applying to Dalton. This isn’t Dalton.”

In a similar case, a charter school in was caught last year weeding out applicants who performed poorly on a reading test or had learning disabilities or behavioral issues. That school, Albany Preparatory Charter School, was placed on probation and its principal was replaced, but it eventually had its charter renewed for three years.

Putting Academic Leadership on probation means the school could be closed if it does not follow the city’s recommendations, which included revamping the lottery process, hiring a director of operations and having more frequent board meetings.

The city began investigating admissions practices at Academic Leadership after an article in May by this reporter on Gotham Schools, a Web site that covers New York City education. City officials said they found no evidence that the school’s staff was skimming higher-performing students off the top of the applicant pool, and said that any possible testing of applicants prior to the lottery appeared to be accidental.

But city investigators interviewed only current Academic Leadership employees and members of its board. Interviews with five former employees and seven parents who applied to the school, along with documents they provided, point to a system of inappropriately testing students or reviewing their previous school files, with those who did not meet the standards of the principal, Norma Figueroa-Hurwitz, being shut out.

Charley Grant, who was Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz’s executive assistant for the school’s first year, said in an e-mail message that she “ordered her educational staff to carry out the testing, would issue an order about whether a student was to be granted admission to the school, and would order the administrative staff to carry out the order.” He added, “If the city had asked me, I would have told them that.”

A former teacher who provided with copies of several students’ applications said one of them was turned away because his report card from another school indicated that he was disruptive in class and careless in his homework.

“We were told to ask how they liked their school and why they’re leaving their current school,” said the teacher, who insisted on anonymity for fear of losing her job at another school. “She wanted to find out, ‘Were these kids trouble?’ ”

Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz did not respond to requests for comment. Ted Hurwitz, her husband and the school’s co-founder, said in an interview before the city’s letter was sent that “the testing we do is always for placement,” not admission. “If anybody was tested other than for placement, it was because they thought they were already accepted,” he added.

Nick McNickle, the chairman of the school’s board, said that there were no plans to remove the principal, but that the lottery would be overhauled, possibly by hiring an outside group to oversee it or by conducting it electronically.

Santasha Malone, who applied to several charter schools for her kindergarten-bound son in early 2010, said she was told in February that her son was on Academic Leadership’s waiting list — though the lottery was not until April — and that she and her son were invited for an interview.

“They were basically the only school who had an interview before the lottery,” Ms. Malone, 32, said. After a teacher took her son to a classroom and asked him to name different objects around the room, they never heard from the school again.

While parents were being told they were on a waiting list, the school paid more than $16,000 its first year for marketing campaigns to drum up applications. After some students left and others were expelled, Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz raised concerns about losing financing for underenrollment in a report to the board.

Before opening Academic Leadership, Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz had spent decades running schools in the city, building a reputation for improving test scores first as principal at Public School 83 in East Harlem and then at the Sisulu-Walker Charter School in , which was in danger of losing its charter for poor academic performance.

Beverly Garcia-Anderson, an academic director with Victory Schools, which managed Sisulu at the time, noted that Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz had raised scores enough to get the charter renewed. “I never saw personally any evidence of her doing something to manipulate the system,” Ms. Garcia-Anderson said.

But James Merriman, head of the New York City Charter School Center, a nonprofit group that supports charter schools, said his organization twice denied Dr. Figueroa-Hurwitz’s grant applications, out of concern that she and her board did not seem prepared for the challenge of managing a school.

“A fair lottery system is at the heart of being a charter school,” Mr. Merriman wrote in an e-mail. “If it turns out the lottery wasn’t fair, especially if there was an attempt to select students, then it will be hard to justify this school staying open.”
535 2011-07-21 LONDON — Front pages across Britain featured pictures of Rupert Murdoch apologizing for phone hacking at The News of the World. But further suggestions that the practice spread beyond his newspaper emerged in a small, nondescript courtroom on Wednesday, even as Prime Minister David Cameron broadened an inquiry into the conduct of the British press.

At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, lawyers for the actor Hugh Grant and his former girlfriend, the socialite Jemima Khan — once the subject of relentless tabloid attention — mentioned The News of the World and unspecified “other newspapers” while demanding police information on Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who was jailed in 2007 for hacking into the phones of royal staff members. It was the first suggestion that Mr. Mulcaire, who had an exclusive contract with The News of the World, might have sold his information to other publications. Those publications were not named in the court proceedings, but the judge referred to “one or more newspaper proprietors.”

The phone hacking scandal at The News of the World has escalated into a political firestorm because it has swept up not only the tabloid’s parent company, the News Corporation, owned by Mr. Murdoch, but also exposed close and questionable ties among the press, Scotland Yard and Britain’s political elite.

But in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron said it would be naïve to think that phone hacking was limited to Murdoch-owned newspapers. He named members to a panel that will have broad power to force newspaper owners, reporters, politicians and the police to give evidence under oath at public hearings into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. It will be led by Lord Justice Brian Leveson, a prominent judge, and includes former journalists, a civil rights campaigner and a retired law enforcement official.

Mr. Cameron was not alone in declaring the need for a broader look at Fleet Street.

On Tuesday, a member of Parliament accused the CNN anchor Piers Morgan of phone hacking when he was the editor of The Daily Mirror. Mr. Morgan strenuously denied the accusations and demanded an apology. And last week, news reports showed that the actor Jude Law has brought a hacking lawsuit against The News of the World’s sister newspaper, The Sun.
536 2011-07-21 That puts the onus squarely back on the House, the chamber that invented this crisis. Although Speaker recently showed willingness to consider a deficit-reduction plan along the lines of the Senate gang’s, his momentary stab at reasonableness was quickly shot down by the ultraorthodox tax haters in his caucus. In their fanatical drive to cut spending below all rational levels, House Republicans have overtly courted default by passing a bill on Tuesday requiring that a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution be sent to the states before the debt limit can go up. The bill has no chance of passage in the Senate and was designed solely to make House members appear resolute to loyalists who are not paying close attention to reality.

The Gang of Six plan calls for at least $1 trillion in new tax revenues by eliminating and reducing tax breaks and deductions. For conservative senators like , , and to accept this reality shows how willfully blind the House majority has really become.

The senators’ willingness to compromise is commendable, but the agreement they have assembled is really more a collection of talking points than a budget plan, and contains some highly dubious provisions.

The tax sections are slippery, and their size depends on whether the for the wealthiest Americans are finally allowed to expire.

It proposes to eliminate the , which was designed to collect income from the wealthy that had been sheltered in deductions and loopholes. This tax should be changed. Because it has never been adjusted to current economic reality, it has come to ensnare the incomes of Americans who are much farther down the wealth ladder, while failing to capture many of the superrich. Fairness and sound policy would also dictate eliminating tax breaks for the very rich, like the preferential rate for capital gains. But the gang’s plan says nothing specific about that.

The proposal protects some important programs for the poor, including food stamps and the earned income tax credit, but could make some significant cuts to entitlement programs, education and environmental protections. Its details are so thin that it is impossible to know where the most damaging cuts could come, and its call for an immediate $500 billion in cuts could have a devastating effect on the prospects for an economic recovery.

For all its flaws, the Gang of Six plan — unlike the ideas floating in the House — is at least a framework for further discussion. It is much more promising than the being cobbled together by Senate leaders to raise the debt ceiling in three increments while cutting at least $1 trillion in spending with no revenue increases.

It is hard to see how the extremist Republican caucus in the House could accept the Gang of Six plan. At the moment, at least 80 members have signed a letter objecting even to the “Plan B” proposal. But perhaps the growing prospect of a financial crash will focus a few minds. With a bit of extra time, and a good deal of extra sense, there is still a chance to avert disaster.
537 2011-07-21 But Thomas Lauria, one of M.L.B.’s lawyers, sounded a more conciliatory tone than the one in the court filings. “If we’re the devil, they’re the devil’s spawn,” he said, arguing that “we don’t succeed if the Dodgers don’t succeed. For better or worse, we’re worse than married.” He paused and said, “That doesn’t sound very good on the record.”

The immediate issue before the court was whether Judge Kevin Gross would approve the Highbridge financing on Wednesday. Late last month, when the Dodgers filed for bankruptcy, he allowed Highbridge to lend the team $60 million through Wednesday, when he was supposed to decide who will lend the full $150 million.

If Judge Gross rejects the Highbridge loan, he could not then agree to baseball’s.

“If I deny the motion,” Judge Gross said, “there is no financing, unless they come to you. Given the bitterness here, how does that get done?” Lauria said baseball would offer it as quickly as possible. “Life’s too short,” he said.

As Judge Gross adjourned to deliberate for ruling, perhaps, on Thursday, he said: "This is not an easy decision, I assure you. To me, this is about dollars and cents. This is not the control issue the parties think it is."‬

More than anything else about the Dodgers’ bankruptcy, the animosity between Selig and McCourt stands out like the hatred that flared with regularity during the 1970s between Charles O. Finley, the contentious Oakland A’s owner, and Bowie Kuhn, baseball’s stiff-necked commissioner.

The bad blood has been the emotional undercurrent of the dispute.

McCourt believes Selig’s hostility led the commissioner to withhold the team’s money from baseball’s central fund, veto loans and reject a 17-year cable television deal with Fox Sports that would have resolved the Dodgers’ financial crisis.

Indeed, McCourt also pointed beyond Selig at Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of M.L.B., as another hostile figure. Days before the Dodgers filed for bankruptcy, McCourt asked Manfred to help with $80 million in interim financing.

“Sell the team,” Manfred told him, according to deposition testimony read in court from John McHale Jr., baseball’s executive vice president of administration.

Baseball’s filings in the case depict McCourt’s gross mismanagement of the team, his use of the team as a “personal piggy bank” and his draining it of $180 million, a sum that the Dodgers insist is $30 million.

The hearing underscored the mutual mistrust between the team and M.L.B. It was held nearly a year after the Texas Rangers were sold in a bankruptcy court auction.

The Dodgers’ assistant treasurer, Jeffrey Ingram, testified that McCourt and the Dodgers would not ask baseball for financing to ease the team’s severe liquidity crisis. But Ingram spent a frantic week in June sounding out Goldman Sachs, G.E. Capital, Time Warner Cable, Bank of America and a few others, without success, before selecting Highbridge.

“We didn’t want baseball to be our lender because of the adverse relationship between the parties,” he said. “We prefer our lender to be a commercial lender.”

Bennett spent considerable time enumerating various conditions — the details that he said had “negative consequences” — in M.L.B.’s proposed loan that he described as a “land mine,” “inappropriate,” “absurd,” “inconceivable” and “horrifying.”

Lauria said that nearly every condition that Bennett found objectionable would be remedied, which he said could have been done earlier if the team had not refused to negotiate a loan with baseball.

“We’re here to do what’s in the best interests of the team,” Lauria said. “Tell us what you need.” He added: “The Dodgers are important to us, even though by some of the papers filed I’m not sure the Dodgers understand this.”

Missing from the sixth-floor courtroom were the two protagonists, Selig and McCourt. Selig, and other M.L.B. officials, were exempted from giving depositions in the case, and presumably from testifying in court, by Judge Gross. McCourt’s absence left Ingram to spend hours as his stand-in on the witness stand.

Ingram, a reticent executive who once worked at McCourt’s real estate company in Boston, testified under cross-examination that baseball’s proposed financing was better than Highbridge’s on virtually every term he was asked about.

Nonetheless, Bennett said that baseball’s proposed loan was filled with “potholes” and “catches” that made it less beneficial than it would appear. “Accepting this money,” he said, “will come with some trouble.”
538 2011-07-21 Tiger Woods has fired his caddie Steve Williams, ending a 12-year relationship in which he won 72 times worldwide, including 13 majors. “I want to express my deepest gratitude to Stevie for all his help, but I think it’s time for a change,” Woods said on his Web site.

Williams worked the last three tournaments with Adam Scott. That included the last two majors, which Woods skipped while trying to recover from injuries to his left leg.

The relationship began showing signs of strain after Woods crashed his car on Thanksgiving night in 2009, which led to revelations of extramarital affairs and Woods’s eventual divorce. Woods’s ex-wife and Williams’s wife were friends.
539 2011-07-21 Also off the foyer is a spacious living room, with designs typical of the architect: floor-to-ceiling French windows decorated with curlicued metal railings by the sculptor Fritz Kuehn, built-in cabinets, and herringbone oak floors. A second, square corner living space adjoins the first, which in turn connects to the kitchen with a complete wall of windows looking out onto the twin building across the street. In both the kitchen and the living area, Ms. Steidel enjoys the fascinating play of light and shadows that move along the walls of her apartment. "When you live here, it’s like being on a balcony above the city," she said.

Ms. Steidel has renovated the apartment as true to its original state as possible, guided by original photographs. She is an extreme minimalist. "I can’t bear to have much around me; openness and clarity keep me calm," she said with a laugh

Much of the apartment is devoid of furniture; what furniture there is, is largely transparent. In the front of the living room, the built-in cabinets are empty (she calls them "cabinet sculptures"). A few striking cylindrical lamps in raw materials like silver or gold plate act as singular pillars in the office and living rooms. Transparent inflatable plastic furniture by pneumocell is set on the floor of the corner living space; in the adjoining kitchen, translucent shelves and chairs surround a simple stainless steel kitchen table.

"I reduced things so much that the full attention is on the architectural details," she said. These details include the diamond patterns on the windows of the interior doors, subtle molding work on the walls, sculptural radiator covers, original Bakelite door handles, as well as the built-in cabinetry throughout the home, which displays dark oak wood on the inside. In a play on proportions, Mr. Henselmann designed the main living spaces at slightly different heights, with the highest ceilings in the corner living room and the office.

Some of the built-in furnishings are credited to the architect’s wife, Irene Henselmann, who worked with her husband throughout his career while bringing up their eight children (who, incidentally, had their own large apartment next door, to which they were banished with a nanny in the evenings when their parents entertained famous friends such as the architect Philip Johnson and the playwright Bertolt Brecht).

Though Ms. Steidel has taken pains to protect the architect’s legacy throughout the apartment, the bathroom is an exception. She had it completely redone to her own design. The otherwise white room displays a large low-lying tub basin in solid brass, as well as a brass block along the wall, supporting a seemingly levitating stainless steel sink in front of an oversized, recessed steel-gray mirror. The only other splashes of color in the starkly white-walled apartment are the storage and utility rooms off the foyer, which are painted lime green and lavender. Ms. Steidel has been instrumental in bringing artistic tenants into the tower, now home to artists, architects, writers, filmmakers, theater directors, the Haubrok Collection exhibition space as well as the offices of the art magazine "Texte zur Kunst."

In this way, too, she is following in the footsteps of Mr. Henselmann. Back in the 1950s, the architect worked with artists as a way of supporting them, like when he asked the famous painter Bert Heller to create the colorful ornate stucco inlaid mosaic for the building’s hotel-like lobby. “It’s a piece of Berlin,” she said. “This place became a home for art. Now it’s a creative community.”
540 2011-07-21 “I fully believe that it is the data center — the cloud — that is driving Intel,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst with Evercore Partners.

Demand for cloud computing is created by the soaring popularity of smartphones and tablets, which provide consumers with continuous, on-the-fly access to the Internet. Mr. Otellini told analysts in May that the technology industry needs one data center server computer for every 600 smartphones in use and one server for every 122 tablets. “We believe we are very early in the cloud build-out and that Intel is well positioned to grow,” Mr. Otellini said. During the second quarter, revenue growth in Intel’s data center group accounted for $2.44 billion.

Wall Street analysts had said earnings would remain flat at 51 cents a share while revenue would increase 19 percent to $12.84 billion. In the same period last year, Intel earned 51 cents a share on revenue of $10.77 billion.

Mr. Otellini said he expected Intel’s revenue to grow in the mid-20 percent range for the year. Revenue will be about $14 billion, Intel said, compared with a forecast of $13.5 billion.

Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of sales excluding production costs, will be about 64 percent, up from 61 percent in the second quarter.

Intel reported that sales in its PC group rose 11 percent, in stark contrast to reports of sluggish PC shipments worldwide. The technology research firm Gartner said last week that shipments grew only 2.3 percent during the second quarter, to 85.2 million computers.

But while Intel has continually confounded skeptics forecasting gloom in the PC market, the company has come under intense criticism lately for stumbling in the market for smartphones, where some analysts worry that it may be too late for Intel to catch up. Products based on a competing chip standard, known as ARM, have quickly dominated the market. Intel is not expected to have a viable alternative on the market for several months.

Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that production of its mobile chip was on track.

The financial report was issued after the close of regular trading Wednesday. Shares of Intel closed at $22.99, then declined slightly in after-hours trading. The second quarter was the first full period that included the results of McAfee and Infineon Wireless, which Intel acquired in the first quarter. Those businesses contributed about $1 billion in revenue during the second quarter.
541 2011-07-21 Automakers are pushing for the weakest standard and want the president to riddle it with loopholes. Americans want much better. A survey conducted in May for the Consumer Federation of America, for instance, found that 65 percent of Americans, including 62 percent of Republicans, supported a tough mileage standard— 60 m.p.g., which would come from installing technology that cuts carbon dioxide emissions 6 percent each year.

It is the biggest single step the president can take against global warming — and its benefits go beyond that. They would curb our appetite for oil, create jobs and start to check the flow of billions of dollars to OPEC and others.

The stronger the emissions standard, the less gas we will buy — and the more we will cut our dependence on oil and save at the pump.

With less money going to foreign oil producers, more would go into our economy. This in turn will create jobs: as many as 700,000, including 60,000 in the auto industry, according to a study last month by Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental and public interest groups. If the United States reduces auto emissions 6 percent a year, it will cut oil consumption 217 million barrels more in 2025 than it would if the reduction is only 3 percent, according to calculations by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That means we would pay $16 billion less to foreign oil producers in 2025, with oil at $140 a barrel. Indeed, for every percentage point weaker than a 6 percent cut, foreign oil producers get an extra $5.5 billion from United States consumers.

So, here’s the decision for Mr. Obama: Keep the money here or send it there?

The technology to meet a strong mileage and emissions standard sits largely neglected on Detroit’s shelves: high-strength, lightweight materials, more-efficient engines and transmissions, and better aerodynamics. Tough standards mean that automakers will need to add it to most vehicles. The hybrid Toyota Prius and Chevrolet Volt show what you can get when you move the technology onto the assembly line.

Yes, the gas-saving technology will raise the cost of the average car. But by needing less fuel, consumers will come out $5,700 to $7,400 ahead, even after paying the higher showroom price, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation. Spend a little to save a lot. That is a good deal.

Carmakers acknowledge that they can comply with a stringent standard. Even G.M., which blew its market lead when it failed to embrace advanced technology, says it can meet an emissions standard that produces a 60 m.p.g. average.

Still, an industry that resisted airbags and catalytic converters is resurrecting its tired argument that consumers will not buy innovative, clean cars. Despite cadging an $85 billion bailout, its lobbyists are fighting aggressively to weaken the next round of standards. What chutzpah.

News reports say the administration and automakers have discussed a 5 percent proposal that would produce cars and light trucks delivering an impressive-sounding 56 m.p.g. by 2025. But look under the hood. The plan would have an escape hatch, allowing for a review that could lower the target before the most stringent rules would take effect, or end the program if automakers convince the government to do so.

This and other loopholes would turn the standard into Swiss cheese. Automakers are eligible for a mileage and emissions credit if they switch to cleaner air conditioning fluid before 2016. The plan would give them the same credit again after 2016, even if they had made the switch. This would be like buying the same horse twice. Another would give a disproportionately large break to companies that make electric vehicles, allowing them to sell additional nonelectric vehicles that give off more emissions than the electric vehicles save. And automakers are lobbying for a backloaded plan, with the biggest cuts at the end and meager reductions at the start.

Mr. Obama has the historic opportunity to begin solving three of the nation’s most vexing problems: global warming, the thirst for oil and high gas pump costs. You do that with a strict emissions standard, not loopholes.
542 2011-07-21 Undertakers have been aware of formaldehyde’s dangers for more than a decade — the first workplace restrictions on formaldehyde came in the 1980s — and many have been changing their embalming practices to make the process safer.

“In our new facility, the ventilation is very good,” said Michael J. Lensing, co-owner of the Lensing Funeral and Cremation Service, in Iowa City, Iowa. “In our old facility, oh, my God. It was different.” At the Lensing funeral home, roughly 60 percent of the bodies are embalmed.

The array of precautions were on display at the A. A. Rayner & Sons Funeral Home on Chicago’s South Side, where Charles S. Childs Jr. provided a tour last month of a funeral home started in 1947 by his grandfather.

Back then, he said, embalmers went about their work without gloves or masks or much ventilation. Years later, ducts were installed in the ceiling so the fumes wafted in front of their faces as they were sucked out of the room.

But now Mr. Childs’s embalming area is fume-free. There were five bodies lying on gurneys, in various states of preparation, and a sixth in a harness, prepared to be lowered into a casket. A colleague who was preparing to embalm one of the bodies wore gloves and a protective apron, and planned to add eyewear and a mask once he got started.

“We have to protect ourselves,” Mr. Childs said.

Various forms of body preservation have been around for eons, including mummification by the ancient Egyptians. During the Civil War, embalmers prepared the bodies of soldiers on the battlefield and shipped them their family by train or horse and buggy. A high point in embalming lore is that President Lincoln’s body traveled by train from Washington to Springfield, Ill., with public viewings on the way.

Arsenic was then one of the primary preservatives. Formaldehyde eventually replaced it.

Modern-day embalming fluid is a mixture of formaldehyde, other less toxic chemicals and water. The embalming fluid that is injected to the arterial system, to replace blood, is up to 5 percent formaldehyde, while a more concentrated form — up to 50 percent formaldehyde — is injected into the body cavity.

An average embalming requires a minimum of three gallons of the embalming solution, said Melissa Johnson Williams, executive director of the American Society of Embalmers.

Ms. Dodge’s company began selling embalming fluids without formaldehyde a few years ago, and some companies now market “green burials” in which less toxic chemicals are used. But while the sales of nonformaldehyde products are increasing, she said that as of yet they simply do not work as well and cost nearly three times as much.

The problem is that the new embalming fluids do not give bodies that “everlasting effect,” said Ed Lins, a funeral director at Cross Island Funeral Service, in Flushing, N.Y. “I wouldn’t embalm a body that is being shipped overseas with it,” he said.

Said Isaiah Owens, who owns a funeral home in Harlem, “It may look perfectly well. But it may be smelling.”

The first major safety improvements in the funeral industry’s use of formaldehyde came in the 1980s after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration set exposure limits for the chemical in the workplace, including mortuaries. About a decade ago, the National Funeral Directors Association met with chemical companies and urged them to come up with alternatives to formaldehyde, Mr. Fitch, the association’s senior vice president, said.

Two years ago, the association released a stronger set of recommendations for how its members should deal with formaldehyde. Foremost on the list was installing a proper ventilation system that regularly changes the air in the room and is tested often to make sure it is working properly.

Since formaldehyde is heavier than air, ventilators should be installed below “the breathing zone of the embalmer.” The group also urges embalmers to wear respirators and nitrile gloves, rather than latex, because they are more resistant to formaldehyde.

The average funeral home embalms about 150 bodies a year, suggesting that many embalmers are not exposed to formaldehyde throughout the day. But these days, many funeral homes outsource the embalming to “trade houses” that do many times the average. Among them is Paccione Funeral Directors in Staten Island, which embalms up to 140 bodies a month.

“In our facility, we do a complete air change in the space every four minutes,” said Rocco Paccione, the owner, adding that embalmers wear protective eyewear and suits.

Studies of workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde have found higher incidences of certain types of rare cancers.

But while a few funeral directors said they knew of cancer among some older undertakers, most said they did not know of any colleagues who had developed the rare cancers.

“I just love what I do,” said Mr. Owens, the Harlem funeral director. “There’s a risk associated with any occupation. So I’m willing to do what I do and let nature take its course.”

Such attitudes make Joseph Sehee’s job a tough sell. He is the executive director of the Green Burial Council.

“I can’t tell you how many funeral directors come up to me and say, three generations and no cancer,” he said. “In this industry, more than any other you’ll come across, there is really an emotional relationship these guys have with the chemical companies and the chemicals.”
543 2011-07-21 But the sequencing of Dr. Moore’s genome also emphasizes how far technology has run ahead of the ability to interpret the information it generates.

Dr. Moore’s genome has a genetic variant that denotes a “56 percent chance of brown eyes,” one that indicates a “typical amount of freckling” and another that confers “moderately higher odds of smelling asparagus in one’s urine,” Dr. Rothberg and his colleagues reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. There are also two genetic variants in Dr. Moore’s genome said to be associated with “increased risk of mental retardation” — a risk evidently never realized. The clinical value of this genomic information would seem to be close to nil.

Dr. Rothberg said he agreed that few genes right now yield useful genetic information and that it will be a 10- to 15-year quest to really understand the human genome. For the moment his machine is specialized for analyzing much smaller amounts of information, like the handful of genes highly active in cancer.

The Ion Torrent machine requires only two hours to sequence DNA, although sample preparation takes longer. The first two genomes of the deadly E. coli bacteria that swept Europe in the spring were decoded on the company’s machines.

The earliest DNA sequencing method depended on radioactivity to mark the four different units that make up genetic material, but as the system was mechanized, engineers switched to fluorescent chemicals. The new device is the first commercial system to decode DNA directly on a semiconductor chip and to work by detecting a voltage change, rather than light.

About 1.2 million miniature wells are etched into the surface of the chip and filled with beads holding the DNA strands to be sequenced. A detector in the floor of the well senses the acidity of the solution in each well, which rises each time a new unit is added to the DNA strands on the bead. The cycle is repeated every few seconds until each unit in the DNA strand has been identified.

Several years ago, Dr. Rothberg invented another DNA sequencing machine, called the 454, which was used to sequence the genome of James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. Dr. Rothberg said he was describing how the machine had “read” Dr. Watson’s DNA to his young son Noah, who asked why he did not invent a machine to read minds.

Dr. Rothberg said he began his research with the idea of making a semiconductor chip that could detect an electrical signal moving across a slice of neural tissue. He then realized the device he had developed was more suited to sequencing DNA.

George Church, a genome technologist at the Harvard Medical School, said he estimated the cost to sequence Dr. Moore’s genome at $2 million. This is an improvement on the $5.7 million it cost in 2008 to sequence Dr. Watson’s genome on the 454 machine, but not nearly as good as the $3,700 spent by Complete Genomics to sequence Dr. Church’s genome and others in 2009.

Dr. Rothberg said he had already reduced the price of his chips to $99 from $250, and today could sequence Dr. Moore’s genome for around $200,000. Because of Moore’s Law — that the number of transistors placeable on a chip doubles about every two years — further reductions in the cost of the DNA sequencing chip are inevitable, Dr. Rothberg said.

Stephan Schuster, a genome biologist at Penn State, said his two Ion Torrent machines were “outstanding,” and enabled a project that would usually have taken two months to be completed in five days.

There is now “a race to the death as to who can sequence faster and cheaper, always with the goal of human resequencing in mind,” Dr. Schuster said.
544 2011-07-21 Factor 2: the multitouch screen. You cycle through screens by swiping the glass, zoom out by pinching and rotate something by twisting two fingers.

In Lion, Apple has gone as far as it can go to bring those factors to the Mac.

Full-screen mode makes a program fill the screen, edge to edge, without any scroll bars, menus or other window-edge clutter. It’s refreshing and useful, especially on laptops, because your screen feels so much bigger.

Autosave spares your having to remember to hit Save as you work. New commands in the title bar can rewind your document to an earlier state, lock it in one version or spin off a copy that you want to take in a different direction.

There’s even a new program, Launchpad, a clone of the iPad’s Home screen, with evenly spaced app icons, on swipeable pages, that open with one click.

And what about Factor 2, the touch screen?

Touch-screen computers don’t work. There, I said it. Spending the day with your arm outstretched, manipulating tiny controls on a vertical surface is awkward and exhausting. The ache you feel later is not-so-affectionately known as Gorilla Arm.

Apple has built what it considers a better solution, a horizontal multitouch surface. That’s the trackpad of its laptops, and the top surface of its current mouse.

In Lion, there are iPad-like multitouch gestures. Pinch four fingers to open Launchpad. Twist two to rotate. Swipe up with three fingers to open Mission Control, a clickable constellation of thumbnails that show all open programs and windows. And so on.

Warning: you scroll a page up by dragging two fingers up, as on the iPad. It makes sense; after all, you scroll the screen left by dragging left, and right to go right. But it takes a couple days to stop scrolling the wrong direction, as we’ve been doing for decades.

Does the iPadization of the Mac succeed? There’s good news, bad news and then good news.

The good news is that once you learn all of this stuff, it does work. Swiping sideways with three fingers takes you from one full-screen app to the next, animated as though someone’s dealing full-screen cards. Launchpad would be a better fit for technophobes if it were always there waiting, and not a program you have to open manually every time; but otherwise, the Lion makeover is fluid and satisfying.

The bad news is that a lot of the promise is Apple’s wishful thinking. Features like full-screen mode, autosave and rotate/zoom gestures generally work only in Apple programs. Other companies’ apps, like Word and Photoshop, have to be upgraded to incorporate these new features.

The final good news, though, is that you can ignore all of this. If you prefer the status quo, you don’t ever have to put an app into full-screen mode, or use a touch gesture, or open apps from the Launchpad. You can even turn off that reversed-scrolling-direction thing. Just this once, Apple isn’t dictating the way you have to do things.

Meanwhile, you still get dozens of other nips and tucks for your 30 bucks. Some are terrific.

The AirDrop window, for example, shows the icons of nearby Macs running Lion. You can transfer a file just by dragging it onto the appropriate Mac’s icon. You don’t have to mess with permissions or sharing setup — just an O.K. button, and then the deed is done.

Many apps have been redesigned to look better, or at least more iPad-like, or to exploit full-screen mode. Some, like Mail, exhibit some really thoughtful design advances, like folder bookmarks that can stand in for the space- folder list. Others, like iCal and Address Book, hide important elements, like the list of calendar categories or address groups, for no good reason. Give to iCal, though, for knowing how to parse new-appointment notations like “Chris lunch Fri 2 pm.”

More goodies in the hit parade: if you drag one folder onto another with the same name, the Mac offers to merge their contents. You can now resize a window by dragging any edge. Preview lets you add your signature to a PDF document quickly and easily — a signature you’ve recorded just by holding it up to your Mac’s camera.

A Resume feature offers to reopen all programs and windows just the way you had them when you shut down. The Migration program can bring over all your files, addresses, calendars, mail accounts and Picasa photos from a Windows PC and put them in the right places on the Mac.

Ordinarily, $30 would be a great price for this huge list of refinements. But there are some good reasons not to rush right away into this Lion’s den.

Apple giveth, and Apple taketh away. This time, it hath taken away Rosetta, a software kit that allowed ancient programs to run on the Intel chips that Apple started using in 2006. A few programs won’t run without it, including, alarmingly, Quicken. Apart from switching to a different finance program, like the lame Quicken Essentials or the lesser-known iBank, no solution is in sight.

Note, too, that there are a few bugs on this newborn cub. I encountered intermittent glitches with the Resume feature, MobileMe syncing alerts, missing menu bars, various Mail features and, on one very special day, dog-slow program opening. Apple attributes most of those problems to a rare endless-loop iCal upgrade problem, unique to my laptop, which it says it will fix in an update.

The Lion upgrade, in other words, is classic Apple: innovative to some, gimmicky to others, big leaps forward, a few stumbles back. It may never be the king of the jungle. But once the world’s software companies have fully Lionized their wares, and once Apple exterminates the bugs, Mac OS X 10.7 might be something even more exotic: a fast, powerful, good-looking, virus-free, thoroughly modern operating system.
545 2011-07-21 After refusing to speak publicly for four years since leaving jail about his role or about what his superiors at The News of the World might have known about his practices, within hours of the announcement he appeared in front of television cameras for the BBC outside his home to suggest he might speak soon.

“As you can appreciate, we are in the middle of a number of inquiries at the moment,” he said. “It’s a very fluid and developing situation. Like I said, the developments have been different from day to day, and I have no further comment to make at this stage. However, this may change.”

His trove of detailed private notes, seized from his home by the police in 2006, is at the core of the widening scandal. Names, numbers and details of phone hacking from the notes have come into public view through legal discovery in the courts, and show an array of victims well beyond the royals including celebrities, government officials and most notably a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and killed in 2002. Mr. Mulcaire himself is now a defendant in 37 lawsuits over phone hacking claims, with more suits being prepared and filed every week.

Mr. Mulcaire employs at least one lawyer full time, and several others part time, according to two lawyers with firsthand knowledge of the arrangements, and there have been questions about how he could afford so costly a defense.

In the hearing Tuesday, James Murdoch confirmed that the News Corporation was paying Mr. Mulcaire’s legal expenses, only for the company to move a day later to end the payments. Mr. Mulcaire could not be reached for further comment.

Mr. Murdoch also confirmed payment of legal fees for Clive Goodman, the tabloid’s royals reporter who was also jailed in 2007, but the News Corporation did not say Wednesday whether it was ending those payments. Mr. Goodman has since been re-arrested in a new police investigation over allegations of police corruption. The Murdochs repeatedly said in their testimony before Parliament on Tuesday that they had not known about the hacking.

In a separate, qualified concession, the News Corporation also announced that it would release the law firm Harbottle & Lewis from some of its client confidentiality requirements so that it could address questions from police and parliamentary inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption with respect to “what they were asked to do.”

The law firm, which has counted the queen among its clients, was embroiled in the scandal because it reviewed The News of the World e-mail that suggested payments to the police. News International, the News Corporation’s British newspaper group, did not turn that information over to the police for four years.

A full waiver could open up those files to victims of hacking who are lining up to sue the company.

The News Corporation’s announcement did not say that the law firm could speak publicly on the matter, nor did it make clear whether the law firm could speak about anything beyond the scope of what it was asked to do. Members of Parliament are particularly interested in learning whether the law firm noticed and flagged the e-mail suggesting the police payments, and if so, which company officials it spoke to about the matter.

The firm was hired in 2007 in what the News Corporation described as an internal investigation into hacking. But two company officials with direct knowledge said the firm’s mandate was in fact to help the company defend itself in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by Mr. Goodman, the reporter whose arrest with Mr. Mulcaire for hacking the phones of people in the royal household set off the scandal. Mr. Goodman argued that he should not have been fired because hacking was widespread.

The company handed over 2,500 e-mails to and from Mr. Goodman to disprove this. The law firm wrote a letter, later given to Parliament as proof that hacking was not widespread, that said it could find no evidence that the practice had spread beyond Mr. Goodman.

It has since emerged that e-mail suggested that Andy Coulson, the editor of the paper at the time, had signed off on payments to the police. Mr. Coulson, who subsequently became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications, was arrested this month in the scandal.

The e-mail resurfaced when executives decided this spring to re-examine the evidence given to the law firm as the hacking scandal escalated. Lord Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions who was hired by News International to help it re-examine the e-mails, has said that the suggestions of criminality they contained were “blindingly obvious” after a review of just “three to five minutes.”

But the News Corporation appears to be holding firm on another confidentiality agreement that binds a different set of lawyers from talking about negotiations in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World, settled after James Murdoch authorized a confidential settlement worth about $1.17 million, plus legal fees.

Mr. Murdoch has said he was not directly involved in the negotiations over that settlement in 2008, which prevented evidence from becoming public that would have contradicted News International’s insistence that hacking was the work of one rogue reporter. Asked whether he would release the hacking victim in that case and his lawyers to speak about their impressions, he told Parliament on Tuesday that “it is a confidential agreement.”

The House of Commons home affairs select committee report also described “a catalogue of failures” by the Metropolitan Police Service in its handling of the hacking investigation.

But it said it was almost impossible to escape the conclusion that News International was “deliberately trying to thwart a criminal investigation.”

“We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for News International to cooperate with the police,” it said, as it described in withering terms a web of connections between executives at News International and senior police officers.
546 2011-07-21 The order represents a coup for Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, which has not sold new planes to American in more than two decades. American retired its last Airbus jets — a handful of A300 widebodies — in 2009.

“Not only have they sold jets to American, but they have forced Boeing’s hand into pushing for a re-engined 737,” said Saj Ahmad, an analyst at FBE Aerospace in .

Of the 260 Airbus jets on order, 130 will be for the A320neo, an upgraded version of its A320, which Airbus expects to bring to market beginning in 2016. Airbus has been promising fuel savings with the A320neo of as much as 15 percent over current engines. The new plane is also expected to run more quietly, cost less to operate and be able to fly farther or carry heavier loads while emitting less greenhouse gases.

“This is significant for Airbus, but even more significant for Boeing,” said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners, a London brokerage. Boeing, he said, had been “chastened” by the market response to the A320neo, “which is making better headway than anyone had expected.”

Mr. Ahmad of FBE Aerospace agreed. “Boeing has said for months it wouldn’t rush to a decision. But now that they have had to react to this deal, they, too, will capture new swathes of orders.”

Airbus has said it expects to spend around $1.5 billion on the enhancements, and Boeing has placed the costs of fitting a new engine to the 737 within that range. Analysts had estimated that developing an all-new replacement for the 737 would probably have cost Boeing as much as $12 billion.

The 737s and A320s, each of which typically seats 150 to 180 passengers, have formed the backbone of the air travel system for decades. More than 10,000 of them shuttle passengers between large airports.

Boeing predicted last month that North American carriers would purchase more than 7,500 new airplanes between now and 2030, valued at $760 billion. Nearly three-quarters of those are expected to be single-aisle jets. Boeing currently holds a 51 percent share of the North American market, according to Ascend, an aviation consultancy based in London.

As recently as last month, Boeing had appeared reluctant to commit to a significant redesign of the 737 as it faced delays with the . The company, based in , indicated at the in June that it did not expect to make a decision until the end of this year on whether to revamp the 737 with new engines or to develop an entirely new single-aisle jet for delivery around the beginning of the next decade.

American trails , and among carriers in terms of number of passengers.

The new orders will help American update a fleet of more than 600 planes which, with an average age of 15 years, is one of the oldest among the six top United States airlines. Its stable of single-aisle workhorses includes more than 200 McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s, which average more than 20 years of age and went out of production in 1999.

Analysts noted that American’s move also places its competitors under pressure to update their fleets. Delta is also in talks with Boeing and Airbus and has said it aims to place an order by the end of the year. and United are also considering orders, according to industry executives.

“If fuel stays high, and AMR can start pricing fares based on operating aircraft with new-generation engines, everyone might need to respond,” Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst for the Teal Group, wrote in a note to clients.

Thomas Horton, AMR’s president, told analysts in a conference call that he expected the new aircraft would eventually reduce American’s overall fuel bill by 15 percent.

The effect of fuel on AMR’s bottom line was clear in the company’s second-quarter results, which were also announced on Wednesday. American paid an average of $3.12 a gallon for jet fuel in the quarter, up 32 percent from an average of $2.37 a gallon in the period a year earlier — an increase of $524 million. That fuel bill increase more than offset a $440 million gain in revenue, to $6.1 billion.

AMR reported a net loss of $286 million, compared with an $11 million loss a year earlier.
547 2011-07-21 LONDON — It was Prime Minister David Cameron ’s turn to battle for his reputation, and potentially even his job, in the House of Commons on Wednesday in a debate on the phone hacking scandal that has convulsed Britain .

And when the daylong political street fighting with the opposition Labour Party was done, he appeared to have at least steadied support within his own party and, perhaps as important, within the ranks of the Liberal Democrats, his nervous coalition partners.

The confrontation in the House of Commons — a day after appearances before a parliamentary committee by Rupert and James Murdoch, whose News of the World newspaper, now defunct, has been at the heart of the scandal — capped a difficult period in which the politically agile prime minister appeared to lose his normally assured demeanor, allowing Labour to get ahead of him in putting an end to the Murdochs’ bid for Britain’s top satellite television company.

Mr. Cameron flew back from a shortened trade trip to Africa on Tuesday and worked late into the night preparing for the showdown over revelations about the tabloid that have exposed cozy and sometimes corrupt relations among the press, politicians and the police, and that have crystallized into the most serious crisis of credibility and confidence of his 15 months in office.

As the eight-hour Commons showdown ended, the prime minister appeared to have quieted the worst anxieties in his Conservative Party, whose most powerful backbench group gave him a desk-banging thumbs up. Several Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, emerged from the session to say that the emphasis should be on reforms to rid Britain of the excesses of its tabloids, and not on efforts to topple Mr. Cameron, unless there were new disclosures implicating him in efforts to stifle the police investigation of the issue or to mislead Parliament.

Only a week ago, the Liberal Democrats seemed to be edging closer to an alternative compact with the Labour Party that could have threatened the government’s survival and its program of harsh spending cuts.

Still, with police inquiries into the affair accelerating, posing the potential for further revelations and arrests, Mr. Cameron may, at best, have only stalled the Labour onslaught that has sought to link him to the scandal through his close ties to Mr. Murdoch and two former editors of The News of the World, one of whom was Mr. Cameron’s communications chief for nine months.

After more than two weeks in which Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, outflanked Mr. Cameron at virtually every turn, the prime minister appeared to hit his stride, coupling incensed denials of personal wrongdoing in the affair with a new, hard-edged attitude toward his former media chief, Andy Coulson, one of 10 people linked to the Murdoch newspapers who has been arrested in the scandal.

Showing an edge of bitterness toward a man he was describing only days ago as a friend, Mr. Cameron said that “with 20-20 hindsight and all that has followed, I would not have offered the job, and I expect that he wouldn’t have taken it.”

“You live and you learn,” he added, “and, believe you me, I have learned.”

Mr. Cameron also took on Mr. Miliband, saying that most of the abuses now under investigation within the Murdoch newspapers took place when Labour was in power and that the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had taken no action on evidence that serious wrongdoing had occurred. He also said that Labour’s ties with Mr. Murdoch and his executives, and the party’s pursuit of Mr. Murdoch’s political favor, were more extensive than his own.

“I can assure the House that I’ve never held a slumber party or seen her in her pajamas,” Mr. Cameron said, referring to Rebekah Brooks, a onetime editor of The News of the World, who resigned as chief executive of News International, the paper’s parent company, late last week. The gibe referred to a gathering Mr. Brown’s wife held in 2008 at the prime minister’s country retreat, which British newspaper accounts have said was attended by Ms. Brooks; Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi; and his daughter Elisabeth. A Daily Mail account said guests were told to bring their pajamas “for the sort of sleepover usually favoured by teenage girls.”

Mr. Cameron’s defense on Wednesday — and his continuing vulnerability — rested on two potentially explosive issues. First was why he hired Mr. Coulson only months after Mr. Coulson’s 2007 resignation as The News of the World’s editor, then took him to Downing Street, in the face of a flurry of private warnings, after the Conservatives won the May 2010 general election.

561 2011-07-22 Three years in, the different approaches of some assessors are emerging as mirrors of their communities: friendly in the suburbs, high tech in Silicon Valley, and in San Francisco — a city where a protest of some sort occurs nearly every day — cantankerous.

“It was very adversarial,” said David Zisser, who appealed the assessment of his Japantown condominium.

Mr. Zisser, a lawyer who spoke animatedly with his paperwork strewn across a table in the downtown Olympic Club, bought his home in 2005, near the height of the market, for $604,000. But in 2009, even after the housing market had collapsed, the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office placed its value at $653,000.

Mr. Zisser won his appeal — his 2009 assessment was revised to $572,000, then later lowered to $565,000 for 2010 — but he said the process took about 40 hours of work to research, file paperwork and shepherd his case through the system.

“Dragging people through this is ridiculous,” he said, noting that he is still waiting for refunds.

He is not alone: 6,600 assessment appeals were filed in 2009, and another 5,500 in 2010.

Phil Ting, the city’s assessor-recorder, who is also a candidate for mayor, said he hoped fewer than 5,000 property owners would appeal their 2011 assessments. Value estimates are being mailed this month.

Mr. Ting said he had been able to settle 80 percent of appeals without full hearings, which he considered an accomplishment given the size of the task. Property values throughout much of the city remain down from pre-recession highs, prompting many owners to seek reassessment.

“This is not a market correction.” Mr. Ting said. “This is like a U.S. economy correction.”

To cope with the situation, this year his office has proactively reduced the assessments on 18,841 of 200,000 total parcels in the city — eliminating the need for those owners to appeal.

But despite these efforts, Mr. Ting said that the antiquated computer system he inherited when he took office in 2005 was a hindrance. “Think of it as Fred Flintstone,” he said.

Those limitations mean that owners cannot see exactly how their properties’ values were determined until an appeal is well under way — a situation that creates contention and requires time-consuming efforts to find information elsewhere (frustrations I experienced firsthand when I appealed my assessment, and won).

“We would like to have a more transparent system,” Mr. Ting said, noting that his office has been working on improving the computer system.

By comparison, in Santa Clara County in Silicon Valley, as of this year homeowners can go online, enter a privacy code and see their account in detail, including the county’s math. Disagree with the result? An appeal can also be done online.

Larry Stone, the Santa Clara County assessor, said, “Each year we’re adding electronic functionality to do what we do.”

Mr. Stone said that since the new system was installed, the culmination of 15 years and millions spent on innovation, inquiries to his office had dropped by half.

In the Sacramento area, according to Mr. Coupal, the taxpayer advocate, reduction appeals were handled at amiable weekend workshops for property owners.

As in San Francisco, other counties have proactively reduced assessments in recognition of the downturn. In Santa Clara County, Mr. Stone said that this year 124,148 properties (one-third of the county’s total) were assessed below their purchase price.

“But they are not legally required to do so,” Mr. Coupal said of the proactive reductions. Ultimately, “the burden is on the property owner,” he pointed out.

In San Francisco, Mr. Zisser just received his latest assessment: up $15,000 to $580,000. He disagrees with that figure, but said appealing this time was not worth the grief.

“The city has made the process adversarial so people won’t go through it,” he said.
562 2011-07-22 BOSTON — The lion was panting. The tigers were gnawing at blood-flavored ice pops. And as the temperature approached 90 on Thursday at the Franklin Park Zoo, Jockamo the anteater was basking in the chilly spray of a garden hose, courtesy of Jeannine Jackle, one of his keepers.

Ms. Jackle and her fellow zookeepers were also wilting in the heat, but they said it was the animals they had to look out for.

“Obviously, your vigilance has to be increased on a day like today,” said John Piazza, the zoo’s mammal curator.

Treats are a must on steamy days. There were frozen bananas for the gorillas, and for the tamarin monkeys, heart-shaped ice cubes spiked with mealworms. The ostriches had a sprinkler to strut through.

Ms. Jackle, assistant curator of the Tropical Forest exhibit, aimed an electric fan at the white-crested hornbills and contemplated who, besides Jockamo, would enjoy a hose-down.

“The vulture loves to get hosed,” she said. “The storks, too. The tapirs, they’re really aquatic, but they want nothing to do with it.”
563 2011-07-22 The Mexican Army has seized about 925 tons of chemicals used for making methamphetamine in a raid in Central Mexico, one of the biggest finds of its kind ever made in the country. The seizure took place in a warehouse in an industrial area in Queretaro, about 125 miles north of Mexico City, the Defense Ministry said in a statement late Wednesday. According to local news media reports and a leading analyst, it was the largest seizure of meth chemicals since President Felipe Calderón called for an army-led crackdown on Mexico’s drug cartels shortly after taking office at the end of 2006. Meth, a stimulant, is smuggled into the United States and sold in crystal or powder form.
564 2011-07-22 The $29.1 billion cash and stock offer by Express Scripts for Medco Health Solutions is not just one of the largest deals of the year. It is also a huge antitrust roll of the dice. The combination would create a behemoth in the pharmacy benefits management industry. So much so, it looks like a provocation to trustbusters.

The health care companies act as middlemen by pooling customers and negotiating discounts from drug makers while pocketing a slice. Express Scripts, led by George Paz, says the combination will yield $1 billion in annual cost savings. That is believable: though the two companies have similar levels of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Express Scripts has about half as many employees.

The big savings explain the 5 percent bounce in Express Scripts’ share price on Thursday, which in turn increased the value of its offer to around $73.64 per Medco share. But the regulatory uncertainty explains why Medco shares, though up a deal-fueled 14 percent, settled at a relatively large 13 percent discount to the value of the bid. It won’t be easy to convince the Federal Trade Commission that the deal will not decrease competition. The combined group would have about 35 percent of the market, Deutsche Bank estimated. Express Scripts tried to buy Caremark four years ago when the big companies in the sector were less dominant, and even then Caremark  fended off the approach by arguing that such a deal would not fly in Washington.

Express and Medco do not seem especially confident this time. They took the unusual step of waiving breakup fees if the merger was not approved. By contrast, even AT&T is promising to pay a breakup fee if regulators turn down its takeover of T-Mobile.

That difference aside, Express is borrowing AT&T’s tactics. For example, Express says the combination would not harm consumers partly because of Medco weaknesses. One is that UnitedHealth Group, a big health insurer, has declined to renew a contract that accounts for more than 15 percent of Medco’s revenue. Express argues that because UnitedHealth will do the job itself the market is becoming more, not less, competitive.

Perhaps. But regulators will want assurances that a more dominant Express-Medco would pass savings on to customers, not just to shareholders. Either way, Wall Street’s warm reception of the deal highlights how much is at stake. Expect Express Scripts to fight hard to get its way.
565 2011-07-22 Nor did governments do much to help. Some governments — those of weaker nations in Europe, and state and local governments here — were actually forced to slash spending in the face of falling revenues. And the modest efforts of stronger governments — including, yes, the Obama — were, at best, barely enough to offset this forced austerity.

So we have depressed economies. What are policy makers proposing to do about it? Less than nothing.

The disappearance of unemployment from elite policy discourse and its replacement by deficit panic has been truly remarkable. It’s not a response to public opinion. In a recent News/New York Times poll, 53 percent of the public named the economy and jobs as the most important problem we face, while only 7 percent named the deficit. Nor is it a response to market pressure. Interest rates on U.S. debt remain near historic lows.

Yet the conversations in Washington and Brussels are all about spending cuts (and maybe increases, I mean revisions). That’s obviously true about the various proposals being floated to resolve the debt-ceiling crisis here. But it’s equally true in Europe.

On Thursday, the “heads of state or government of the euro area and the E.U. institutions” — that mouthful tells you, all by itself, how messy European governance has become — issued their big statement. It wasn’t reassuring.

For one thing, it’s hard to believe that the Rube Goldberg financial engineering the statement proposes can really resolve the Greek crisis, let alone the wider European crisis.

But, even if it does, then what? The statement calls for sharp deficit reductions “in all countries except those under a programme” to take place “by 2013 at the latest.” Since those countries “under a programme” are being forced into drastic fiscal austerity, this amounts to a plan to have all of Europe slash spending at the same time. And there is nothing in the European data suggesting that the private sector will be ready to take up the slack in less than two years.

For those who know their 1930s history, this is all too familiar. If either of the current debt negotiations fails, we could be about to replay 1931, the global banking collapse that made great. But, if the negotiations succeed, we will be set to replay the great mistake of 1937: the premature turn to fiscal that derailed economic recovery and ensured that the Depression would last until World War II finally provided the boost the economy needed.

Did I mention that the — although not, thankfully, the — seems determined to make things even worse by raising interest rates?

There’s an old quotation, attributed to various people, that always comes to mind when I look at public policy: “You do not know, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed.” Now that lack of wisdom is on full display, as policy elites on both sides of the Atlantic bungle the response to economic trauma, ignoring all the lessons of history. And the Lesser Depression goes on.
566 2011-07-22 American and European regulators issued safety alerts on Thursday about Multaq, a drug approved two years ago to treat abnormal heart rhythms.

The Food and Drug Administration said a study of the drug in patients with a long-term form of the disease, known as atrial fibrillation, showed twice as many deaths as those who did not take the drug.

The alerts provided the first details of a 3,000-patient trial halted by Sanofi-Aventis two weeks ago. The company had cited “a significant increase in cardiovascular events.”

Multaq was approved for short-term arrhythmia lasting less than six months. Since then, the F.D.A. said, 241,000 Americans have received prescriptions.

The agency said “a critical question” remained: whether the halted study would also foretell problems with those patients who took Multaq for the approved uses. Those patients should talk to their physicians, the F.D.A. said.
567 2011-07-22 Other parts of the communiqué issued by the European leaders after their summit meeting in Brussels promise there will be more central control over national budgets and tax policies.

Call it the federalization of Europe.

Unlike in the first Greek bailout, in spring 2010, the European leaders now accept that the Continent has a responsibility not just to prevent collapse but to get the Greek economy moving again.

In effect, the new decisions recognize that a strategy that might have been called “prosperity through austerity” was a hopeless failure. While there is little doubt that Greek profligacy was an important cause of the mess it is in, a combination of reducing government spending and seeking to raise tax collections was never going to produce a recovery that would make it possible for Greece to pay its debts.

Over the 12 months ending in March, the Greek economy shrank by 5.5 percent, while unemployment, at 12.2 percent when the country was first bailed out, rose to 15 percent.

“We call for a comprehensive strategy for growth and investment in Greece,” said the statement. While it removed a reference to “a European ‘Marshall Plan’ ” that was in a preliminary version of the statement leaked earlier Thursday, it promised that the rest of Europe would “work with the Greek authorities on competiveness and growth, job creation and training.”

Pouring money in will not, in and of itself, make Greek industries competitive again and enable the nation to flourish. In fact, it was money pouring in for most of the past decade that helped to create the problem. Then investors were willing to lend money to Greece for basically the same rate they charged Germany, on the theory that a common currency should mean common interest rates. Those savings — Greece’s effective borrowing rate was cut by more than half from 1998 to 2005 — enabled the government to spend more and tax less than it otherwise would have been forced to do.

That was not what advocates of the euro forecast when it was being created more than a decade ago. Then the theory was that countries would enact reforms — in labor markets, fiscal policies and even work habits — to become more like Germany. They would do that because a failure to do so would result in a country losing competitiveness as its costs rose more rapidly than those of Germany while the prices it could charge could not do so, since both countries used the same currency.

Now, Europe claims it will change, but there is obviously some resistance to detailed commitments. The leaked draft included a promise to “introduce legally binding national fiscal frameworks” by the end of 2012. The final communiqué took out the words “legally binding.”

The countries previously promised not to run large budget deficits, but they all did when the world went into recession. This time, though, we are assured they really mean it.

With more control over fiscal policy at the European level, Europe is also moving toward something akin to a European monetary fund in the financial stability facility, known as the E.F.S.F. It would be able to buy Greek government bonds on the secondary market, effectively reducing the Greek national debt since Greece would owe what the bonds cost the E.F.S.F., not the higher face amounts.

If there was little enthusiasm in Europe for such centralization of power, there was even less for the obvious alternative: abandon the euro. Had Greece not been in the euro zone, it probably would have followed the Argentine path of nearly a decade ago: default and devalue. With Argentina’s industries newly competitive because the peso lost most of its value within weeks, Argentine exports and the economy recovered faster than many expected.

There is, however, no clear way for a country to leave the euro, and no leaders have advocated it.

But the effort to rescue Greece on the cheap clearly did not work. The deal Europe now advocates will force losses on banks. Major banks have signed on to plans that will force them to accept lower interest rates and extended maturities or — if they prefer — somewhat higher interest rates on bonds whose principal would be reduced by 20 percent. In return, Europe as a whole would effectively guarantee eventual principal repayment.

There is, in principle, no need for a more fiscally and economically unified Europe to be more like Germany and less like Italy or Greece. But Germany is unlikely to accept less fiscal discipline, and for the rest of Europe to regain competitiveness while sticking with the euro would seem to leave those countries with little choice.

It is of course possible that the decisions being made in Brussels will be negated or watered down as the details are considered. But the failure of the earlier bailouts, and the obvious risk of contagion, has forced Europe to move toward consolidation to preserve the euro. Those pressures will be there even if politicians want to step back at a later date.

The positive market reaction on Thursday should also be kept in perspective. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds, which had risen to more than 6 percent in panicked trading on Monday, fell below 5.4 percent on Thursday as word of the apparent agreement spread. But that is still higher than it was two weeks ago. Similarly, a 10-year Greek bond sold for more than 55 percent of its par value, up from less than 51 percent a few days ago. But it sold for nearly 75 percent of par value as recently as February.

A few weeks ago, the European Central Bank was unwilling to even consider allowing the admission that Greece would have to default. Germany was unwilling to agree to a bailout with open-ended costs. Both backed down in the face of economic and market realities.

Those realities will continue to pressure Europeans toward either abandoning the currency union or accepting much more financial union. For now, anyway, they are choosing the latter course.
568 2011-07-22 The revelation caused members of the British news media to descend on Delray Beach, eager to hear what Mr. Miskiw had to say about the hacking at Mr. Murdoch’s newspapers.

Speaking in front of his apartment on Thursday, he said: “I am returning to the U.K. voluntarily. My solicitor has been talking to the police for some time now so I have effectively been in touch with the police. They know where I am and they know I am returning. That is all I have to say.”

A former reporter for The News of the World told The New York Times this month that Mr. Miskiw had helped him find the location of a source he was seeking by using a cellphone number. He and another reporter said this was part of a practice known as “pinging,” in which technology reserved for the police was used to pinpoint locations based on cellphone towers. The reporter said each request cost $500.

On Thursday, Scotland Yard said it was considering looking into the accusations following a request by Jenny Jones, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, the London police oversight body.

Mr. Miskiw did not answer calls for comment.

On Wednesday, Mr. Mulcaire, the private investigator at the heart of the scandal, broke his long silence a few hours after the News Corporation said it was terminating its arrangement to pay his legal fees in the 37 lawsuits over phone hacking claims that he now faces.

His appearance before the television cameras outside his home in a southern London suburb raised questions about whether he, too, might soon provide more details about whether executives at the News Corporation had covered up the hacking, although he refused to provide immediate comment. He made another statement on Thursday through his lawyer, Sarah Webb of the firm Payne Hicks Beach. Mr. Mulcaire indicated that he was cooperating with the police but that he would not speak publicly to say what he knew about the extent of the hacking until after the police inquiry had ended.

News International, the British newspaper division of the News Corporation, paid Mr. Mulcaire’s legal fees in the civil cases because he had been under contract with the company and it had accepted liability for him. His legal fees in the original criminal case over the hacking of the phones of members of the royal family, which ended with his going to jail in 2007, had been paid by legal aid. The payments in the civil cases are now due to end, although usually there is a notice period for such contracts.

Several former News of the World employees said the person fired by the News Corporation on Thursday was Matt Nixson, the features editor of The Sun who had worked until recently for The News of the World. Mr. Nixson was fired “because of something found in his e-mails,” the former employees said.

Citing the News Corporation, the BBC reported that he had been fired over allegations of phone hacking. Mr. Nixson has told friends that he did nothing wrong, the former employees said.

The program “Newsnight” on BBC reported late Thursday that three lawyers representing some of the phone hacking victims had themselves been News of the World targets. One of the lawyers, Mark Lewis, said that “Newsnight” had informed him he was a target during the first three months of this year.
569 2011-07-22 In your July 18 front-page article about high-frequency trading, “Fast Traders, in Spotlight, Battle Rules,” you write, “The S.E.C. has already put in place new stock circuit breakers to stop another flash crash.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission cannot prevent another flash crash. The circuit breakers, like seat belts in a car, are intended to restrain the damage — in this case to investors.

There have been numerous crashes of individual stocks since the dramatic flash crash of May 6, 2010, an event that traumatized retail investors. For example, on July 12, shares of Brown Forman (BF.A) plunged from $69.28 to $16.64 in one second, most likely the result of a robotic trading machine run amok.

The circuit breakers allow for the breaking of such erroneous trades after the fact, not the prevention of such trades. A flash crash across stocks, commodities and other asset classes on multiple exchanges is still possible.

In fact, I would argue that owing to trading at the speed of light by robotic trading systems operating without direct human intervention, another flash crash is probable.

570 2011-07-22 The federal debate is already complicating life for state and local governments.

is postponing a bond sale that had been scheduled for Friday, after the state was warned that its rating would probably be lowered in the event of a federal downgrade. , which typically issues short-term at this time of year, is working to arrange bank instead, citing the market uncertainty. And state officials across the nation are trying to figure out what will happen to the federal payments they rely on for everything from to unemployment to highway construction if a deal is not reached to raise the debt ceiling by the Aug. 2 deadline.

States whose economies rely on the federal government — including Maryland and , home to many federal employees and contractors — are at the greatest risk if there is no agreement and Washington has to decide which payments to make and which to skip. They were among the states warned by this week that their credit ratings were being jeopardized by Washington — which would make it more expensive for them to borrow for costs like construction, through no fault of their own.

“For nearly 75 years we have worked hard to earn the highest credit ratings from all three rating agencies,” Gov. of Virginia, a Republican, wrote this week to and members of Congress, urging them to raise the debt limit. “Now your failure to get the job done is hurting the businesses and citizens of our commonwealth.”

Many state and local officials are still hoping that a deal will be reached, averting a situation in which federal payments to the states could start to be cut in August. But a number of states have begun preparing for the worst.

Ric Brown, Virginia’s secretary of finance, said that it was a difficult task, made much more difficult by the lack of concrete information coming from Washington. “What you’ve got at the federal level, let’s face it, is outright chaos,” he said in an interview. “It’s hard to make sense out of that.”
571 2011-07-22 LONDON — Prince Andrew will resign as an ambassador for British businesses abroad, Buckingham Palace said Thursday.

The 51-year-old prince, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, has recently been the subject of a series of embarrassing revelations, including his friendship with a convicted sex offender.

The palace said the prince would “relinquish his role as the United Kingdom’s special representative.” He had been promoting British trade overseas since 2001, but he had come under pressure in recent months.

Last year it was revealed that the billionaire son of President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan had paid $24 million in 2007 for a mansion the prince owned in the south of England. The amount was $5 million more than the asking price for the home, which had been on the market for five years. The prince denied any wrongdoing.

A few months later, a confidential State Department diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks described the prince as speaking “cockily” and verging “on the rude” during a trade discussion in Kyrgyzstan.

This year it was revealed that the prince had maintained a close friendship with Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire American financier sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution.
572 2011-07-22 Ms. Thompson, 72, was born in 1939 on land that her grandparents, black sharecroppers, farmed in rural Booth, in southeast Texas. As an infant, she moved with her mother to her great-grandmother’s boardinghouse in Houston’s Fourth Ward.

Ms. Thompson worked as a teacher but was drawn to politics. She was elected to the House in 1972, on the heels of the Sharpstown stock scandal.

By the mid-1990s, she was a rising star in the House: She pushed a bill mandating court-ordered alimony through in 1995 and worked across the aisle to “get redlining out of the bedroom” by forcing insurers to cover new forms of birth control. Her contentious James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which included protections for gay men and lesbians, passed in 2001. Behind the high-profile successes, Ms. Thompson passed measures to help low-income people pay their electric bills, stave off cuts to nursing homes, provide support for rape victims and prevent racial profiling.

“To her last breath she will defend those who can’t defend themselves,” Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, said of Ms. Thompson earlier this year, during a roast in which he called her the Legislature’s “mama bear.”

Ms. Thompson sees herself as a different animal: the House lion. “I prowl around to make sure people keep working for good,” she said. “If you’ve been downtrodden all your life, if you’ve known the struggle of the voiceless who can’t afford to hire lobbyists to have their needs addressed, you’re always going to try to do that.”

And she does not prowl quietly, making emotional, game-changing speeches one minute and swearing at colleagues the next.

She made her first personal-privilege speech months after she was elected, calling an incident in which a male lawmaker jokingly referred to her as his “beautiful mistress” a “sexist and racist insult.” (She came full circle this session with her speech condemning the flier, threatening male legislators, “If you don’t stand up for us today, don’t you walk in this chamber tomorrow.”)

When the Texas House approved putting a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage onto the 2005 ballot, Ms. Thompson said it was fanning the “hell-fire flames of bigotry.”

“She knows when to bully you and when to hug you,” said State Senator Rodney Ellis, a fellow Democrat of Houston. “She knows when to get revenge and when to be forgiving. And she can do it all within the span of 24 hours.”

Some political observers suggest that Ms. Thompson’s civil rights history and her reputation for defending the “little dog” have given her political cover to carry the occasional bill that seems out of character. They say business and industry interests — which contributed a combined $370,000 to her campaign fund in the last election cycle, according to an analysis by the money-in-politics group Texans for Public Justice — lobby Ms. Thompson to carry their bills in the hopes that her support will stem Democratic opposition.

Ms. Thompson says campaign contributions do not play into her decisions and that she will not support a bill unless she is convinced it supports the public good. “My campaign contributions do not come mostly from my constituents,” she said, “but 99 percent of my fights are for my constituents.”

Tom Smith, the Texas director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit public interest group, said that Ms. Thompson is generally a consumer-friendly legislator. “But there have been a number of sessions where she carried a bill for some industry or another we were surprised at. As Ann Richards used to say,” he said, referring to the former Texas governor, “ ‘You’ve got to dance with them that fund ya.’ ”

After lawmakers passed a $5-a-patron fee on strip clubs in 2007 to raise money for sexual-assault prevention and health insurance for low-income individuals, Ms. Thompson came back in 2009 and filed a bill that would have replaced it with a different — and smaller — tax on cover charges at sexually oriented businesses. Her measure, which failed, was supported by the strip club industry, which contributed at least $22,500 to Ms. Thompson’s campaign between 2007 and 2010, more than to any other lawmaker, according to Texans for Public Justice figures.

Ms. Thompson, who declined to carry the measure again this session, said she did so in 2009 because she thought it was the quickest way to get money to sexual-assault programs. She said her bill had a far better chance of standing up in court, where the 2007 fee’s constitutionality is still being challenged (with the money held up in the meantime).

Ms. Thompson also maintains a close relationship with the energy lobby. This session, she carried a “streamlining” bill — intended to make it easier for electric utilities to raise their rates to account for infrastructure improvements without a full-blown hearing. Despite opposition from consumer groups and concern from some communities, the bill passed.

In the 2009 session, in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane season, Ms. Thompson was the House sponsor of a measure allowing utility companies to recover weather-related costs without going through the routine rate-change proceeding. The day after Mr. Perry signed the bill, CenterPoint Energy filed an application with the Public Utility Commission seeking to recover nearly $678 million in costs associated with Hurricane Ike.

In both cases, Ms. Thompson and other supporters argued that the existing rate-case hearing system was unwieldy and that speeding it up actually curbed costs for consumers.

Representative Harold Dutton, Democrat of Houston, said Ms. Thompson is sometimes willing to “explore an option that makes people on her side mad” because it is the right thing to do.

Ms. Thompson said she does not offend too easily; four decades in the Texas House will do that to a person. And she shows no sign of slowing down or of tiring of her position — particularly as she watches sweeping state budget cuts and a newly anointed Republican supermajority gut the programs she spent decades fighting to build.

“What else would I do?” she said with a sly smile. “I don’t watch soap operas.”
573 2011-07-22 A 3M spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Buckley available for comment.

Mr. Davis said the company’s filing was untrue and intended to divert attention from 3M’s own problems. “I am accustomed when speaking publicly in only dealing in facts that can be documented,” he said.

The dispute can be traced to 2005 when the equity fund headed by Mr. Boulter acquired a majority interest in the diagnostic test, which was based on technology developed by the British Ministry of Defense. The test, known as BacLite, offered a faster way to identify hospital patients who were carriers of the bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. In recent years, MRSA infections, which are resistant to antibiotics, have caused patient deaths and injuries.

Initial studies indicated that BacLite was highly accurate and, in 2007, 3M struck a multimillion-dollar deal to acquire the test, though the majority of that payout was tied to future BacLite sales. Just a year later, however, 3M dropped BacLite, saying that its subsequent studies found a high rate of false results. By then, several competing MRSA tests had also been introduced.

Entities associated with Mr. Boulter’s fund, the Porton Group, responded with a lawsuit filed in 2008 in London, claiming that 3M had failed to fulfill its agreement to diligently market BacLite. And over the next three years, the case puttered along quietly until just before it went to trial last month.

Several months ago, Mr. Davis began firing off a series of salvos on behalf of Porton. In May, Mr. Davis and some patients held a demonstration outside 3M’s corporate headquarters in St. Paul, at which he accused 3M of abandoning a “lifesaving” technology.

In addition, Mr. Davis filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration asking it to investigate how 3M had conducted its tests of BacLite, which he says the company botched. He also helped set up a Web site, www.mrsa-injustice.com, that tells the dispute from the side of Mr. Boulter’s fund.

Early last month, Queen Elizabeth announced that Mr. Buckley, who holds American and British passports, would receive a knighthood. And as the lawsuit against 3M began to unfold in a London court, Mr. Davis and 3M’s outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, spoke about a settlement, though those discussions apparently did not advance far.

Then, in mid-June, Mr. Davis suggested that Mr. Brewer and Mr. Boulter speak directly with each other. Soon, accusations began to fly.

To hear Mr. Brewer tell it, he was biking in Sag Harbor, N.Y., when he received a cellphone call from Mr. Boulter, who had just arrived in Italy from Dubai, where his fund is based, and was driving down the coast to reach his yacht.

After exchanging pleasantries, Mr. Brewer said that the businessman began making references to talks about BacLite he had been having with Liam Fox, the British defense secretary. The call between the two men then broke off, Mr. Brewer said, as Mr. Boulter drove through a series of tunnels along the Italian coast. Not long after, the lawyer received a lengthy e-mail from Mr. Boulter that 3M said in the lawsuit contained the blackmail threat.

Along with the reference to the “embarrassing situation of George’s knighthood,” Mr. Boulter also wrote in the e-mail that he had a lengthy conversation earlier that day with the defense secretary on “our current favorite topic.” He stated that British officials viewed 3M’s decision not to market BacLite as a violation of trust and that, while 3M might prevail in a courtroom, there could be business ramifications for the company.

“It might leave Gov quietly seething for a while, with ramifications for a while — they have memories like elephants,” he wrote. He suggested that 3M settle the case, adding that at a “headline of $30mn+ you will allow MoD to internally save face.”

Mr. Boulter rejected any suggestion that his e-mail contained a threat to 3M, adding that he had discussed the note’s contents with Mr. Brewer before sending it. He also said that his reference to his discussion with Mr. Fox about “our current favorite subject” was not about BacLite.

“I thought I was in a good-faith confidential settlement discussion,” Mr. Boulter said.

Mr. Brewer said that Mr. Boulter’s threat was clear and that he reinforced it in a second e-mail, in which Mr. Boulter cited Mr. Fox again, writing “I need to tell something” to him.

“3M quickly decided that the only way to treat this type of behavior was to push it out into the sunlight immediately,” Mr. Brewer said.

Mr. Boulter said that he and the defense secretary had briefly discussed the BacLite lawsuit as part of a broader conversation and that he brought up the potential public relations problems for Mr. Buckley given his knighthood and 3M’s behavior in the case. “I said it was unfortunate because it was going to attract a lot of media attention,” Mr. Boulter said.

Asked about Mr. Boulter’s comments, a spokesman for the ministry of defense said that Mr. Fox and Mr. Boulter had not discussed the BacLite case or anyone’s knighthood.

A decision in the MRSA-related lawsuit against 3M is not expected for some time.
574 2011-07-22 These days many performers in classical music speak to audiences to share insights and stories. But it is not often that an artist disavows a performance he has just given.

This happened on Wednesday night at the International Keyboard Institute and Festival at Mannes College the New School for Music, when the noted French-Cypriot pianist Cyprien Katsaris finished a ballistic account of Chopin’s “Military” Polonaise.

The bushy-haired Mr. Katsaris, 60, warned the many aspiring pianists in the audience never to offer an “ignominious” performance like the one he had just given for an exam or a competition; otherwise “the jury will ——,” he said, going silent. Then he made a gesture to slice his throat with his right hand. The audience laughed and applauded.

During this two-week festival the evening recitals mostly come in pairs. Earlier on this night, as part of the Prestige Series that presents younger artists, Gesa Luecker, a thoughtful German pianist, played works by Mozart, Liszt and Schumann.

Then, as part of the Masters Series, Mr. Katsaris, who has had a major, if somewhat unconventional, career and has not played often in America, offered lots of Liszt and Liszt transcriptions, as well as three Schubert-Liszt favorites. He also played works by Haydn, Chopin and his own finger-twisting arrangement of Gottschalk’s exuberant novelty piece, “The Banjo.”

If Mr. Katsaris’s Chopin polonaise was burly and clangorous, there was something compelling about it, if only because he had an extreme concept that he carried through, notes be damned. In a way, isn’t that the definition of a master? A master pianist may or may not be a role model. But a master has reached a point where he knows what he is about.
575 2011-07-22 The focus, however, is inevitably on Windows, Microsoft’s flagship product.

Revenue from the unit that sells the Windows operating system software fell 1 percent, to $4.74 billion. It is the second consecutive quarter that Microsoft’s Windows revenue has fallen, a trend that Microsoft executives expect to continue because of the weakness in PC sales. The division’s fortunes are closely tied to PC sales, which worldwide grew 2.6 percent in the quarter, according to IDC, the market research firm.

The shifting demand toward tablets is worrisome to Microsoft because most tablets run on Apple’s operating system or on Google’s Android software.

Tablet manufacturers have shown little interest in adopting Windows, leaving Microsoft out of what some of its executives had thought was a niche product. Sales of tablets are expected to triple to 43.6 million units in 2011 from a year earlier, according to eMarketer, a market research firm.

Microsoft attributed some of the decline in Windows revenue to a greater mix of PCs shipped to emerging markets, where prices were lower. A tough economy and a 41 percent drop in the sales of netbooks also contributed.

Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that Microsoft was trying to make inroads in tablets with an updated version of Windows, to be available in 2012. If it turns out to be “interesting, but not game-changing, then this deterioration will continue,” he said.

Mr. Klein said Microsoft would have more to say about its plans for tablets at its developer conference in September.

Microsoft is also struggling with getting its Windows Phone 7 operating system on smartphones. Earlier this year, Nokia agreed to make phones that used Windows, but the partners have yet to introduce any devices.

In an ominous sign, Nokia said on Thursday that its smartphone sales fell 32 percent in the quarter. The decline shows eroding demand for Nokia’s products and the difficulty Microsoft faces in competing against Apple and Google.

The company still has strengths. Revenue from its Office software, which includes Word, grew 7 percent, to $5.78 billion. The company has said that the latest version, Office 2010, is being deployed at a rate five times faster than its predecessor. An 8 percent decline in revenue from Office to consumers was offset by a 12 percent gain with business customers. Microsoft attributed the weak consumer results, as it did with its operating system, to sales in emerging markets. Revenue from servers and tools, a division that caters to corporate customers, grew 12 percent to $4.64 billion.

A particular bright spot in Microsoft’s portfolio was its entertainment products and devices like the Xbox 360 video game console and the Kinect game controller, which lets users move their bodies to control characters in video games. Sales by the division grew 30 percent, to $1.49 billion.

Microsoft’s shipments of Xbox 360 game consoles increased 13 percent to 1.7 million, underscoring its popularity among gamers. “They are continuing their amazing momentum this year,” Mr. Klein said.

Revenue from Microsoft’s online properties, like the MSN portal and Bing search engine, rose 17 percent, to $622 million. The unit posted $728 million in operating loss, continuing a streak of red ink.

Microsoft took over Yahoo’s search engine in an effort to better compete with Google. But so far, the partnership has failed to raise online advertising revenue as much as executives originally told investors. Both companies are working on the problem, Mr. Klein said, but it will not be resolved until the end of the year.

Shares of Microsoft fell less than half a percent to $26.99 in after-hours trading. In regular trading, they closed nearly flat at $27.10.
576 2011-07-22 The flesh was mottled, lumpy and, in the case of his 1990s portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery and the phenomenally obese civil servant Sue Tilley, shockingly abundant.

The relationship between sitter and painter, in his work, overturned traditional portraiture. It was “nearer to the classic relationship of the 20th century: that between interrogator and interrogated,” the art critic John Russell wrote in “Private View,” his survey of the London art scene in the 1960s.

William Feaver, a British critic who organized a Freud retrospective at Tate Britain in 2002, said: “Freud has generated a life’s worth of genuinely new painting that sits obstinately across the path of those lesser painters who get by on less. He always pressed to extremes, carrying on further than one would think necessary and rarely letting anything go before it became disconcerting.”

Lucian Michael Freud was born in on Dec. 8, 1922, and grew up in a wealthy neighborhood near the Tiergarten. His father, Ernst L. Freud, an architect who was Sigmund Freud’s youngest son, married Lucie Brasch, the heiress to a timber fortune, and the family enjoyed summers on the North Sea and visits to a family estate near Cottbus, in .

In 1933, after came to power, the Freuds moved to London, where Lucian attended progressive schools but showed little academic promise. He was more interested in horses than in his studies, and entertained thoughts of becoming a jockey.

In 1938, he was expelled from Bryanston, in , after dropping his trousers on a dare on a street in Bournemouth. But his sandstone sculpture of a horse earned him entry into the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He left there after a year to enroll in the Anglian School of Drawing and Painting in Dedham, where he studied with the painter Cedric Morris. While it is true that the school burned to the ground while he was there, the often repeated story that Mr. Freud accidentally started the fire with a discarded cigarette seems unlikely.

In 1941, hoping to make his way to New York, Mr. Freud enlisted in the Merchant Navy, where he served on a convoy ship crossing the Atlantic. He got no nearer to New York than , , and after returning to developed and was given a medical discharge from the service.

Mr. Freud was a bohemian of the old school. He set up his studios in squalid neighborhoods, developed a Byronic reputation as a rake and gambled recklessly (“Debt stimulates me,” he once said). In 1948, he married Kitty Garman, the daughter of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, whom he depicted in several portraits, notably “Girl With Roses,” “Girl With a Kitten” (1947) and “Girl With a White Dog” (1950-51). That marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Lady Caroline Blackwood. He is survived by many children from his first marriage and from a series of romantic relationships.

His early work, often with an implied narrative, was strongly influenced by the German Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) painters like Georg Grosz and Otto Dix, although his influences reached back to Albrecht Dürer and the Flemish masters like Hans Memling.

On occasion he ventured into Surrealist territory. In “The Painter’s Room” (1943), a zebra with red and yellow stripes pokes its head through the window of a studio furnished with a palm tree and sofa. A top hat sits on the floor.

Mr. Freud later rejected Surrealism with something like contempt. “I could never put anything into a picture that wasn’t actually there in front of me,” he told the art critic Robert Hughes. “That would be a pointless lie, a mere bit of artfulness.”

A decisive influence was , a fellow artist at the 1954 and the subject of one of his most famous works, a head painted in oil on copper in 1952. Bacon’s free, daring brushwork led Mr. Freud to abandon the linear, thinly painted portraits of the 1940s and move toward the brushy, searching portrait style of his mature work, with its severely muted palette of browns and yellows.

“Full, saturated colors have an emotional significance that I want to avoid,” he once said. To the artist and Freud biographer Lawrence Gowing, he said, “For me the paint is the person.” Mr. Freud’s dingy studio became his artistic universe, a grim theater in which his contorted subjects, stripped bare and therefore unidentifiable by class, submitted to the artist’s unblinking, merciless inspection.

The sense of the artist-model relationship is suggested by “Reflection With Two Children,” a 1965 self-portrait showing Mr. Freud seen from below, the vantage point of a dog looking at its master. Two children, almost miniature in scale, are shunted to the side of the canvas. A glaring light overhead contributes to the impression of the artist as all-powerful inquisitor.

His female subjects in particular seemed not just nude but obtrusively naked. Mr. Freud pushed this effect so far, Russell once noted, “that we sometimes wonder if we have any right to be there.” By contrast, his horses and dogs, like his whippets Pluto and Eli, were evoked with tender solicitude.

“I’ve got a strong autobiographical bias,” he told Mr. Feaver, the British critic. “My work is entirely about myself and my surroundings.”

On rare occasions Mr. Freud took on something akin to official portraits. He painted the collector Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, fully clothed, in “Man in a Chair” (1985). His stern 2001 portrait of Queen Elizabeth, showing the royal head topped by the Diamond Diadem, divided the critics and public.

Some critics hailed the picture as bold, uncompromising and truthful. Arthur Morrison, the arts editor of The Times of London, wrote, “The chin has what can only be described as a six-o’clock shadow, and the neck would not disgrace a rugby prop forward.” The newspaper’s royal photographer said Mr. Freud should be thrown into the .

These were deviations. Much more in the Freud vein was his portrait of a man sprawled on a couch holding a sleeping rat (“Naked Man With Rat,” 1977-78). The animal’s tail, draped across the model’s left thigh, nearly makes contact with his genitals, producing an ineffably creepy effect.

Mr. Freud remained deeply unfashionable in the for many decades, but in 1987 the Hirshhorn Museum in exhibited his work in a show that no New York museum would take on. This was a watershed event. Mr. Hughes proclaimed him “the greatest living realist painter,” and a Freud cult soon developed. In 1993 the organized a retrospective of his work.

“It is an attempt at a record,” Mr. Freud said, describing his work on the occasion of his retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1974. “I work from the people that interest me and that I care about, in rooms that I live in and know.”
577 2011-07-22 But now that Greece’s problems are shaking the euro area, the policy is being questioned.

Banks’ extensive holdings of sovereign debt are a central issue in the crisis, creating a dangerous link between government fiscal problems and bank stability. The exposure of financial institutions to government bonds adds another layer of complexity as European leaders struggle to find a way to reduce Greece’s debt load without bringing down the euro.

“The fact that private banks own considerable shares in European government bonds and risk a major share of their equity in this market makes a restructuring more difficult than otherwise,” Kai A. Konrad, an expert in tax law at the Max Planck Institute, wrote in a paper co-written with Holger Zschäpitz, a reporter for the newspaper Die Welt.

Regulators’ favorable treatment of sovereign debt “is like a subsidy by which the governments distort banking decisions, making banks more inclined to finance government debt than engage in their core business,” Mr. Konrad and Mr. Zschäpitz wrote in the article, published by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich.

Bank stress tests last week provided detailed information on European bank holdings of government debt and allowed analysts to estimate the potential carnage from a Greek default, as well as from price declines for other bonds.

The damage would be substantial.

The data indicated that most banks outside of Greece would survive if forced to recognize market losses on their sovereign holdings. But a large number would have to raise billions in additional capital to return to health.

For example, analysts at Credit Suisse looked at 49 major banks and posited what would happen if they absorbed markdowns on their Greek, Portuguese, Irish, Italian and Spanish debt in line with the losses those bonds have already suffered in the markets. That included a 50 percent markdown on Greek debt.

While only a handful of banks would fail, almost all of them in Greece, more than half the banks would need to raise new capital to bring their reserves back to levels considered healthy, Credit Suisse concluded. The total amount of money they would have to raise would be 82 billion euros ($116 billion).

While it would be easy to blame the banks for making themselves so vulnerable, they were responding to government incentives that are not likely to change anytime soon.

The new banking rules issued by the European Commission will sharply increase the amount of reserve capital that banks must keep on hand, in line with guidelines agreed to by the Group of 20 nations. But European government bonds will continue to be considered risk-free and immune to capital requirements, at least until 2015.

In explanatory documents released Wednesday, the commission acknowledged the issue, asking, “Isn’t the risk of such debt amply illustrated by current events in the euro area?” The commission went on to say that it was simply complying with an agreement among European leaders.

International banking guidelines also put a zero-risk label on government bonds bought by banks in that country. As a result, most banks have huge holdings of their own government’s debt. The five largest Italian banks, for example, own 164 billion euros in Italian government debt, making them acutely sensitive to the fiscal fortunes of their homeland.

New rules taking effect in the course of the decade will force banks to set aside at least minimal sums to cover the risk of government bonds. The so-called Basel III banking rules approved by the G-20 last year would require banks to hold capital reserves equal to at least 3 percent of all their holdings, regardless of the perceived risk. That rule, intended to prevent banks from taking on too much leverage or gaming banking regulations, would also apply to government bonds.

But the rule, known as a leverage ratio, would not take effect until 2018 and could still change. The European Commission said it would impose a similar rule by 2018, but it is waiting until after an evaluation period to determine whether the leverage ratio should be 3 percent or some other number.

The new European rule also gives the commission the power to impose additional capital requirements on banks, including their government bond holdings, if officials see a risk to the financial system.

“It’s not an option to continue like we are today,” said Mr. van Roosebeke of the Center for European Policy.

“The question is if politicians have enough courage to look at the risk.”

The official Xinhua News Agency said the six passengers who managed to escape the fire in Xinyang, in Henan Province, were all hospitalized, with one in critical condition. It said the bus, a sleeper coach, had a 35-passenger limit but was carrying 47 people It was unclear what caused the blaze.
584 2011-07-23 The editors’ suspicions grew when a computer technician at The Telegraph, Jim Robinson, left in January to work for Mr. Lewis at News International. The two celebrated the appointment over pints at a pub.

The episode is significant because in recent weeks Mr. Lewis, 42, has emerged as a leader of the News Corporation’s campaign to clean up the phone-hacking and police bribery scandal that has engulfed the company and raised questions about the judgment of its top executives. He is a member of the News Corporation’s Management and Standards Committee.

The tale of the tape is yet another twist in a scandal that has ricocheted between the people making the news and those reporting it. Those in the anything-goes British press corps had already been suspicious of one another’s methods and motives. Now, every “splash” — a tabloid’s Page 1 story — is assumed to have been “nicked,” or stolen, by a hacked phone or other illicit means.

Within days of Mr. Peston’s scoop last December, The Telegraph hired Kroll, the security firm, to try to determine whether the newspaper was the victim of computer hacking or outright theft of the audio recording, and to identify who might have been responsible.

“It is a matter of record that Kroll was commissioned to investigate the unauthorized removal in December 2010 of an audio recording from Telegraph Media Group,” a Telegraph spokesman said Friday. “They concluded that the removal of the recording was, in all probability, an act of theft orchestrated by an external organization.”

Kroll found circumstantial evidence that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Robinson were behind the episode, according to a summary of its work, though it stressed in its report that investigators had not found direct proof of the link.

Mr. Lewis declined to answer questions about the episode but released a statement through a spokesman. “This is a clear attempt to undermine the strong working relationship between News Corp.’s Management and Standards Committee and the Metropolitan Police Service,” Mr. Lewis said. “Nothing will prevent us from continuing to cooperate fully with Operation Weeting,” the police investigation into illegal phone hacking at The News of the World, a Murdoch newspaper, now defunct, at the heart of the scandal.

A News International spokesman said Mr. Robinson had declined to comment.

Neither Mr. Peston nor the BBC would answer questions on how he had obtained the interview.

Kroll also declined to be interviewed for this article, saying it does not remark on matters concerning clients.

The Telegraph spokesman declined to comment further or to identify remedies it might have put in place to prevent such an episode from recurring.

The New York Times has pieced together a detailed account of Kroll’s internal inquiry through interviews with executives at The Telegraph and a review of Kroll’s executive summary of its work, which was completed last March.

Kroll found that a tight circle of former employees had “strong motivations to damage The Telegraph,” and that they included Mr. Lewis. Kroll investigators concluded that as The Telegraph was preparing its article in December, Mr. Lewis learned about it from a former colleague at the newspaper.

Kroll wrote in its report that it suspected that Mr. Lewis was “involved in orchestrating the leak of the information.”

Kroll concluded that the leak was “a result of unauthorized access to” the newspaper’s computer systems, “most probably from within the organization and by someone with access to it.”

Investigators then tried to determine who on the newspaper’s technology staff had access to the audio file of the Cable interview. They found about 15 people, but quickly focused on Mr. Robinson, the head of the technical support desk. Shortly after the leak, Mr. Robinson resigned to join News International “on unusually favorable terms,” the Kroll report said.

Kroll found that before departing The Telegraph, Mr. Robinson reformatted his iPad, erasing all the data, and cut up the SIM card to his iPhone. “As such it has been impossible to conclude whether there had been incriminating evidence on the devices,” Kroll said.

A senior executive at The Telegraph said that although the paper could not prove that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Robinson were involved, “they had all the motive to do this.”

“You can see how this would impress Will Lewis’s new masters,” said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “The scoop was taken from us and given to Peston for maximum impact. And it was portrayed as if we had sat on a scoop. This would give Will Lewis big credibility in the eyes of his new bosses. And he had another motive — revenge against us. He wanted to make this organization look silly.”

The consequences of the BBC report were enormous. Mr. Cable, a Liberal Democrat, handed over the BSkyB review portfolio to Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative culture secretary, who proceeded to greenlight Mr. Murdoch’s acquisition. (The deal ultimately did not survive the hacking scandal.) The transfer was seen as a major coup by executives inside News International.

At the same time, editors at The Telegraph were questioned by others in the press about why they had not yet published the comments Mr. Cable had made against Mr. Murdoch.

The episode also sheds light on the close relationship between Mr. Lewis and Mr. Peston, the BBC business editor. Both men hail from north London, and have known each other for two decades.

Mr. Lewis was hired in 1994 by Mr. Peston to join an investigations team at The Financial Times, where they worked together closely. Mr. Lewis went on to the New York bureau of the paper and eventually became the main news editor there. He joined The Telegraph in 2005.

In recent weeks, Mr. Peston has landed several scoops about sensitive information that was passed by News International to the Metropolitan Police Service. The reports concerned police officers who were alleged to have accepted bribes from reporters at The News of the World.

Many of those leaks appeared to be intended to shift the focus from News International’s current leadership to Scotland Yard and Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in phone hacking and of bribing police officers.

According to several executives at the News Corporation, the leaks most likely came from within the company.

They prompted the Metropolitan Police to release an extraordinary statement saying it was “extremely concerned” about the release of selected information that was known only “by a small number of people.” The police said the leaks “could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.”

On the BBC Thursday night, Mr. Peston reported that the standards committee run by Mr. Lewis had fired an editor at The Sun for “previous work” he had done at The News of the World.

Shortly after, Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament, accused Mr. Peston on Twitter of “distracting” readers from questions that were raised earlier in the day about the veracity of James Murdoch’s testimony at a Parliamentary committee hearing.

Mr. Watson, who had questioned the Murdochs at the session on Tuesday, told Mr. Peston that “you are being spoon-fed stories” and accused him of being “a patsy” for News International.

Mr. Peston dismissed Mr. Watson’s accusations, saying on Twitter that they did not dignify a reply.
585 2011-07-23 Re “Murdochs Deny That They Knew of Illegal Acts” (front page, July 20):

You report that in Tuesday’s parliamentary hearing in London, Rupert Murdoch was “looking every bit his age, appearing at times to lose his concentration and sometimes taking so long to answer questions that he seemed not to have heard them at all.”

I assume your reporter’s intention was to suggest that Mr. Murdoch was losing his grip at 80. But those who know him well can tell you that this is characteristic of the way he speaks. He was like that when I interviewed him for a biography some 20 years ago.

His deliberate pauses may be disconcerting for his interlocutors, but he seemed as sharp as ever on Tuesday — perhaps especially when he paused before revealing a closer relationship with the former Labor prime minister, Gordon Brown, than the current Conservative prime minister, David Cameron.

I hope that when I am 80 I would, if required, be able to sustain three hours of hostile interrogation as well as Mr. Murdoch did.
586 2011-07-23 Mark Calcavecchia and Lee Rinker of the United States and Canada’s Rod Spittle had a two-shot lead after the second round of the Senior British Open. Calcavecchia, one of three overnight leaders, made six birdies and finished with a three-under 69 at Walton Heath in Walton on the Hill, England. He was joined at seven under by Rinker and Spittle, who each shot a 67. Americans filled six of the top nine places, improving the likelihood of an eighth winner from the United States in nine years.

¶ Miki Saiki of Japan took a one-stroke lead at the Evian Masters, shooting a five-under 67 in the second round to move to nine under in Evian-les-Bains, France. Saiki leads the Americans Angela Stanford, whose 66 included seven birdies, and the Kraft Nabisco winner Stacy Lewis (67). Michelle Wie shot 73 and missed the cut at five over, despite birdies on the last two holes. The seven-time major champion Juli Inkster also failed to make the cut, finishing three over.

¶ Michael Thompson followed up his even-par opening round with a four-under 66 to move into a tie with his fellow American Chad Campbell after the second round of the Canadian Open in Vancouver, British Columbia. Campbell shot 67 in cloudy morning conditions, and Thompson bettered it on a sunny afternoon, finishing with a birdie on the tough 472-yard, par-4 18th.
587 2011-07-23 McDonald’s said second-quarter profit rose 15 percent, topping analysts’ estimates, as more consumers ate out and McCafé beverages raised sales. Net income climbed to $1.41 billion, or $1.35 a share, from $1.23 billion, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier, McDonald’s said in a statement Friday. The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.28 a share. Sales rose 16 percent to $6.91 billion. Stock in McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., rose $2.02, to $88.56 a share.
588 2011-07-23 Five more senior executives are leaving the Thomson Reuters Corporation in a shake-up of its markets division, the company said Friday. The departures follow that of the markets chief Devin N. Wenig, announced Thursday, and reflect the concerns of the board and the controlling shareholder, the Thomson family of Canada, about the performance of the division. The unit, which serves banks, brokerages and other firms, contributes almost 60 percent of the company’s revenue. Analysts have said that the introduction of a new product for financial professionals, Eikon, has been a disappointment. Thomas H. Glocer, the chief executive, said he would assume responsibility for the business instead of hiring a replacement for Mr. Wenig.
589 2011-07-23 Continued robust demand for Caterpillar’s heavy equipment raised the company’s second-quarter profit 44 percent, the company said Friday, but higher costs and cautious comments about China’s economy set off a 5.8 percent decline in its share price.

The company raised its sales outlook for the year, but cost increases, mostly related to its recent acquisition of the mining equipment maker Bucyrus, will prevent rising sales from helping profit more than previously expected.

Caterpillar’s quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates for the first time since the recession ended.

Many investors that were very optimistic about Caterpillar appeared to pause and reassess the prospects for months ahead, said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones, who thinks Caterpillar still has strong long-term growth potential.

“There’s a lot to digest in this quarter,” Mr. Windau said.

The company said it earned $1.02 billion, or $1.52 a share, up from $707 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.

Excluding costs associated with the Bucyrus acquisition, profit per share would have been $1.72.

Caterpillar predicts 2011 sales of $56 billion to $58 billion with Bucyrus. Previously, it predicted sales of $52 billion to $54 billion.
590 2011-07-23 The band performs about 40 shows a year, mostly at Muslim cultural conventions and summer camps. In the last 10 years, they have sold about 40,000 CDs, although, Mr. Ahmad noted, “usually our CD is bootlegged cause there is poor distribution channels for Islamic music.”

Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Muhammad grew up as African-American Muslims in an area of Maryland with few Muslims of any kind. Mr. Ahmad said his parents had joined the Nation of Islam as young adults, but had become orthodox Sunni Muslims and raised him to be religiously observant.

“My parents tried to instill in me that you pray five times a day, make sure you fast, basically all the beliefs of Islam,” Mr. Ahmad said. “But as a youth, it’s very difficult when no one else around you is doing that, and there’s the peer pressure not to pray, just to fit in.”

Through his local mosque, he got involved in Muslim Youth of North America, known as MYNA, an experience that he said “was amazing.”

Mr. Ahmad was 15 when he met Mr. Muhammad at a MYNA camp in Rockville, Md. Soon after, at a MYNA summer camp in Ohio, he met Mr. Salaam, and in 1992 they contributed songs to a cassette compilation called “MYNA Raps.” Over the next decade, the three young men contributed to four subsequent “MYNA Raps” compilations.

“It was something my parents approved of, and it was hip, it was fun, it was uniquely American,” Mr. Ahmad said. “Even though the quality was poor, it was amazing.”

After the last “MYNA Raps” compilation, in 2000, the rappers decided to form Native Deen. The band has never provided its members, who are all married and have children, a full-time living, so they have day jobs. Mr. Ahmad is a Web developer whose clients include NASA; Mr. Salaam is the youth director for a Virginia mosque; Mr. Muhammad works for a relief agency.

Some more famous Muslim rappers, like Mos Def and Lupe Fiasco, are open about their religion but do not make it a main focus of their art. Native Deen, by contrast, writes conspicuously Muslim lyrics. As a result, said Mr. Salaam, who joined us late at the bakery, the group’s music is particularly popular among youth from observant families.

“We tend to deal with the masjid-going community,” Mr. Salaam said, using the Arabic word for mosque. “But the majority of the community is not masjid-going. They may come to the masjid once a week, once a year. But the people we have been primarily dealing with — this masjid invited us, or this Islamic community center, or this relief organization.”

At Native Deen shows, audience members are more likely to be from Middle Eastern or South Asian backgrounds than to be American blacks. One reason, according to Suad Abdul Khabeer, a Purdue University anthropologist who studies Islamic hip-hop, is that Native Deen’s “harmonies and melodies sound like the kind of nasheed” — Muslim praise music — “you get from the Middle East.”

As a result, Dr. Abdul Khabeer said, Muslim immigrants who may look down on African-American culture find Native Deen’s work palatable, while American blacks may find it insufficiently aggressive, sonically speaking. “Hip-hop lite doesn’t speak to them in the same way,” Dr. Abdul Khabeer said. “Black audiences are like, ‘That’s kind of lite.’ ”

But Native Deen’s faith places it in the history of American hip-hop more generally. Pioneering hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa and Wu-Tang Clan have demonstrated in their lyrics the pervasive influence of Islam in black America. Even when rappers are not themselves Muslim, Dr. Abdul Khabeer said, many borrow ideas and terminology from orthodox Islam and from Muslim-identified groups, like the Nation of Islam and the Five-Percent Nation.

“We never saw ourselves as this, because we have just been doing it, but people see us as pioneers in Muslim music,” Mr. Salaam said. “For the ‘MYNA Raps’ people, that is going back 20 years.”

“Later on,” he added, “I think it will be written that a lot of American Muslim experience, Native Deen were part of that.”
591 2011-07-23 The group adheres to an ideology that is a mix of devout Shiism and Marxism, and in the initial phase of the war the Americans bombed the camp and killed several of its members before disarming the group, which had more than 2,000 tanks and armored personnel carriers. But the Americans later provided security for the camp as the Iraqi government, which is friendly with Iran, turned hostile to the group. A raid on the camp in April by the Iraqi Army left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.

Mr. Butler’s mission has been to seek a solution that will save residents’ lives by first moving them to another camp away from the Iranian border, and then to other countries for resettlement. His goal is humanitarian, he said. He betrayed no sympathies for the group’s politics or forgiveness for its misdeeds. He wants them to move, he said, because he fears a slaughter at the hands of the Iraqi Army if they stay.

That solution has proved tricky, however, because the residents are refusing to leave, and no countries have come forward to welcome them. But the clock is ticking, and several times Mr. Butler has reminded members of the group that American forces will be leaving.

For Mr. Butler, the former ambassador to Macedonia whose diplomatic career has placed him across the negotiating table from members of the Irish Republican Army and war criminals in the Balkans, the current dealings have proved just as tough.

“If I don’t get assurances that you will move to a new location in Iraq, the next round of negotiations could be very short,” he admonished the group near the end of the recent session.

After a half-dozen such sessions, he has made little progress in getting the group to agree to leave the camp before Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s government follows through on its promise to shut it down by the end of the year.

Adding to his difficulties, the group has a formidable and well-financed communications machine. It has attracted political figures like Howard Dean and Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general, by paying them to make speeches in support of the group, fueling its resistance to a move and angering officials trying to bargain with it, like Mr. Butler.

Referring to General Clark, Mr. Butler asked the group, “How much was he paid?” He added, “He doesn’t get out of bed for less than $25,000.”

To this, one member replied that none of the group’s famous advocates were “doing it for the money.”

“I’m guessing about a million dollars was spent on this over the last six months,” Mr. Butler said, referring to the overall advocacy campaign. “If I was on your board of directors, I wouldn’t be pleased with the results.”

He continued, “The bad news is, you only have me sitting across the table from you.”

In an interview, General Clark acknowledged having been paid by the group, but he said he gives speeches around the world and always offers his “own personal opinion” based on his many years of government service. (Mr. Dean has previously said publicly that he took speaking fees from the group.)

In a written statement, a representative for the group said it had not paid anyone for speeches.

That the group has access to money from the Iranian dissident diaspora is evident in the modern, well-appointed conference room full of flat-screen monitors. Men in suits served beverages and snacks on silver platters during the recent talks.

Mr. Butler is keen to puncture what he believes is the false narrative that has sprouted around the group since the American invasion, which has helped it secure such prominent support. Contrary to widespread belief, he says, the group never provided any valuable intelligence to the Americans about Mr. Hussein’s government. Nor, he says, has it provided any useful information about the Iranian government or its nuclear program.

He said that for six years the group provided unreliable information about Iran to the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he criticized as having taken years to discern that it was being fed what amounted to a slew of lies.

“They are very good at telling stories,” he said of the group.

Through legal actions, the group has managed to get its name removed from terrorist watch lists in Britain and the European Union; a federal lawsuit in the United States resulted in a judge ordering the State Department to review its classification of the group. The group has not carried out an attack in years, and says it renounced violence in 2001.

The State Department’s public documents show a litany of violent crimes against Americans in the 1970s, including the assassination of military officers and executives in Tehran.

“These people slaughtered Americans,” Mr. Butler said out of earshot of the group’s representatives during the recent negotiating session. “They have blood on their hands.”

The Americans have offered a plan in which the group’s members would vacate this camp, which during Mr. Hussein’s tenure served as a military base, and relocate to another site in Iraq, where they would disband, an essential step before the United Nations would recognize the members as refugees.

“To the outside world, you look like a paramilitary organization,” he told them, before adding, “As a group you are dangerous.”

For now, Mr. Butler is not optimistic about the prospects of getting the group to move, or disband. After a helicopter flight back to the American Embassy in Baghdad after the session, he shared his worry of a lack of political will back home.

“My prediction is Washington is not going to give me any backup,” he said. “It’s just poison. It’s terrorism. It’s Iran. It’s Iraq.”
592 2011-07-23 The effort to reopen the case has attracted the attention of the nation’s most persistent advocate of civil rights-era justice, Alvin Sykes of Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Sykes was instrumental in the reopening of the investigation into the killing of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and in persuading Congress to allocate millions of dollars to the investigation of civil rights cold cases. Mr. Sykes has asked both the Justice Department and, this week, the New York State attorney general “to conduct the most comprehensive and credible search by the government for the truth concerning Malcolm X’s assassination.”

The cause has made for strange bedfellows: Ilyasah Shabazz, one of Malcolm X’s six daughters, is supporting the call to reopen the case despite her objections to the biography, which paints a bleak picture of her parents’ marriage. Leith Mullings, the author’s widow, is also asking for a new investigation.

But it will be an uphill battle, partly because three men were convicted at the time, meaning the case is potentially a hybrid of two separate areas of criminal law: a civil rights cold case and a wrongful conviction.

Malcolm X, who became a patron saint of the black power movement and, long after his death, an American icon, knew his life was in danger when he took the stage at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965. He had broken with the Nation of Islam, which had branded him an enemy and a traitor. A week earlier, his house had been firebombed. As he began to speak, a disturbance broke out in the audience, a smoke bomb went off, and gunmen opened fire.

Thomas Hagan, a member of the Nation of Islam from New Jersey who was then 22, was arrested at the ballroom that day. The police investigated the crime scene for four hours before the blood was mopped up and a planned dance began.

The police later picked up two more Nation of Islam members: Muhammad Abdul Aziz, then known as Norman 3X Butler; and Kahlil Islam, then Thomas 15X Johnson. Both of them had attended a mosque in Harlem. In his book, Dr. Marable says that the Nation of Islam would not have used men from Malcolm X’s own mosque to carry out the killing and that the assassins were from New Jersey.

Mr. Hagan confessed, but always maintained that the other two men were not involved. At the trial, he testified there were other conspirators, but refused to name them. All three men were convicted, but the question of how high the conspiracy went in the Nation of Islam hierarchy — who, in fact, ordered the killing — was never answered.

David Garrow, a historian and a King biographer, obtained and reviewed the Federal Bureau of Investigation files on Malcolm X in the 1990s. He said it was probable that reams of wiretaps of the Nation of Islam had never been combed for clues. In 1980, the bureau said it had never investigated the assassination.

In the late 1970s, Mr. Hagan, also known as Talmadge X Hayer, finally identified his accomplices in an affidavit as part of an unsuccessful effort to free Mr. Butler and Mr. Johnson (all three men have since been paroled).

One of the names he gave was Willie X, whom William Kunstler, the civil rights lawyer who represented Mr. Johnson and Mr. Butler, determined was William Bradley. The others are dead or presumed dead. Dr. Marable wrote that Mr. Bradley, using a sawed-off shotgun, fired the fatal shot.

Mr. Bradley, an ex-convict now in his early 70s, is living in Newark under the name Al-Mustafa Shabazz. (Police records list both names for him.) He is married to Carolyn Kelley Shabazz, described by The Star-Ledger of Newark as a community leader and the owner of a boxing gym who gives away turkeys at Thanksgiving.

Mr. Shabazz served time for conspiracy, drug dealing and making “terroristic threats,” according to records at the New Jersey Corrections Department, and was released in 1998. Through his lawyer, J. Edward Waller, Mr. Shabazz has denied any involvement in the assassination.

Mr. Sykes, who cautions that he has yet to personally see proof linking the name Willie X to William Bradley, would like to see a joint investigation between state and federal officials, but it is the Manhattan district attorney who has jurisdiction over the case.

Mr. Sykes said he would rather that other agencies were involved, because the Manhattan district attorney’s office investigated the killing in the first place.

But there are limitations on other agencies’ ability to investigate. For one, it is not clear if the killing could be considered a civil rights crime because both the perpetrators and the victims are black.

Mr. Garrow said the definition of a civil rights crime should not be too narrow. “When a major civil rights leader is assassinated, I’d like the civil rights division to be interested, regardless of the color of the gunman,” he said, referring to the federal unit.

Some experts say the Justice Department’s participation is crucial because the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department had Malcolm X under surveillance at the time of his death, raising questions about whether law enforcement officials had knowledge beforehand of the assassination plot.

Still, the Justice Department may not have any jurisdiction, and the department has only occasionally investigated without it — in 1998, for example, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a limited review of the King assassination after pressure from the family and the public.

The New York attorney general may investigate only if asked by the Manhattan district attorney or the governor. But cases that are decades old are not easy to solve, said Doug Jones, a former United States attorney in Birmingham, Ala., who helped prosecute the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in which four girls died. “A lot of people think witnesses come forward after so many years have passed,” he said, “but they don’t.”
593 2011-07-23 IF the economies of the bailed-out countries in the euro zone are ever going to prosper again, they will have to somehow regain competitiveness with Germany, the dominant economy in the zone.

New figures released by the European Central Bank indicate that progress is being made, but it is slow.

The figures show that unit labor costs fell 3.3 percent in Greece during the first quarter, and were off 2 percent in Ireland. In Germany, the star economy of the euro zone, unit labor costs fell 0.7 percent.

Those reductions were won at a terrible cost, however. Greece’s economy continues to shrink, while Ireland’s seems to have stopped losing ground but has yet to grow. Unemployment is above 14 percent in Ireland and even higher in Greece.

The accompanying charts show the changes in unit labor costs in Ireland and Greece, as well as in Germany and four other large economies that use the euro — France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The E.C.B. said similar figures for Portugal, the other bailed-out euro country, were not available.
594 2011-07-23 Analysts say several factors favor AT&T, including the company’s decision to begin selling a low-cost version of the iPhone, the 3GS, for $50 earlier this year.

In addition, AT&T was able to successfully lock customers into one- or two-year contract plans before it lost exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in the United States earlier this year.

Still, analysts said, Verizon is outpacing the entire wireless industry in terms of adding subscribers, even compared with AT&T.

Craig Moffett, a wireless analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said, “Verizon’s wireless business has pretty good momentum right now.”

Over all, Verizon’s earnings were solid, beating Wall Street’s expectations for the company. The company reported net income of $1.61 billion, or 57 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $1.19 billion during the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the company to report a profit of 55 cents a share.

Revenue rose 2.8 percent, to $27.54 billion, up from $26.77 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $27.4 billion.

Verizon was betting heavily on the arrival of an iPhone in early summer, executives said in a conference call with analysts and investors on Friday. The company had hoped it would nudge the number of subscribers that had smartphones closer to 50 percent.

Historically, Verizon has lagged behind its rivals in pushing its customers toward mobile devices like smartphones, wireless modems and tablets, and the lucrative data packages that come with them. This push will become especially crucial as Verizon, along with its competitors, move from the decaying landline and voice business and increasingly look toward data services for the bulk of their revenue.

Already, Verizon’s wireless business accounts for 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. Money generated from selling mobile data services is close to 40 percent of Verizon’s wireless revenue.

Lowell McAdam, the chief executive of Verizon Wireless, who will succeed Ivan Seidenberg as chief executive of the parent company on Aug. 1, acknowledged that the company was “maybe a quarter behind what we talked about in January.”

But he expressed confidence that the outlook would sharply improve over the coming months, particularly when the next version of the iPhone was released.

“We don’t know when the next one is going to come out,” Mr. McAdams said. “But we expect that probably sometime in the fall, and I think you will see a significant jump there when we get to that point.”

Investors may not have been as optimistic. Shares of the company dipped slightly, down 83 cents, or 2.21 percent, to $36.74.

One issue with the introduction of the iPhone to Verizon was whether the carrier would buckle under the crush of the new data-intensive users. It has not, which analysts attributed to the fact that Verizon had several years to upgrade its network and infrastructure while watching AT&T struggle with this problem. “Verizon was better prepared thanks to AT&T,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst.

But even AT&T’s network, long the source of complaints from beleaguered users who said they got poor cellular reception and suffered from dropped calls, has improved over all, Mr. Sharma said.

Verizon’s results were lifted by strong growth in the company’s wireless arm, which is 45 percent owned by Vodafone. The company reported a sharp increase — 1.3 million — in net new subscribers in the quarter. Smartphones accounted for 36 percent of Verizon Wireless’s postpaid subscriber phone base, up from 32 percent in the first quarter of the year. Verizon recently began rolling out its fourth-generation wireless network, which uses a fast wireless technology called LTE, and is heavily marketing tablets and smartphones that are compatible with that new technology.

Verizon’s earnings might also shed some light into the brewing rivalry between Apple and Google and both look to dominate the smartphone and tablet industry. Although Verizon continued to achieve sales from its catalog of Android and 4G devices, the company sold far fewer of those devices than they did iPhones. For the quarter, the company reported sales of 1.2 million LTE and Android devices, which includes tablets, smartphones and wireless modems.

“Verizon’s had Android for a long time,” said Mr. Sharma, who keeps a close eye on the industry. “This was the first real test between an iPhone and Android and consumers still gravitate towards the iPhone.”
595 2011-07-23 Still, the rating agency said it would place Greek sovereign debt in “restricted default” and assign a “default” rating to the affected bonds when the country offers to exchange them for ones with longer terms. When the country issues new bonds, the agency said it would probably classify the securities as “low speculative-grade.”

Some senior European officials conceded Friday that the desire to have banks share in the losses by taking longer-term debt had destabilized markets and would have been better avoided. However, the officials said they saw banks’ participation as necessary to gain the support of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has to assuage a restive public.

“I would have preferred not to have this private sector involvement,” said one senior European Commission official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“It was a sine qua non for some member states,” the official added, “but it would have been less risky and less expensive without” it.

The deal means an extra outlay for the donor countries because guarantees will have to be extended to ensure that the Greek banks are protected if Greece is classified in default. The architects of the rescue hope this will be for only a short period of time, limiting the cost.

Meanwhile, financing has to be put up for a bond buyback plan that, ultimately, will cause those in the private sector to take a loss. According to estimates provided by the euro zone countries, the net contribution of the private sector will be about 37 billion euros from 2011 to 2014.

That will come on top of the 109-billion-euro bailout for Greece, though this total does include an estimated 28 billion euros in receipts from privatization through 2014 and 20 billion euros for debt buybacks. How much will be lent by the International Monetary Fund has yet to be determined.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said the Greek rescue plan should not set off payments of credit-default swaps because the debt exchange plan would be voluntary.

European leaders want to tamp down debate about private sector losses, which has the potential to stoke investor worries about the debt of other euro countries.

During the summit meeting on Thursday that led to the deal, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, showed a graph illustrating the movement of bond spreads and how closely they were linked to discussion of the private sector contribution, according to a senior official of the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc.

Though leaders pledged in the communiqué that this would not be repeated in any other case, the markets may take note that the reduced interest rates on Europe’s aid would make the finances of Ireland and Portugal more sustainable.

Lending rates for the three countries will fall to about 3.5 percent and loan maturities will be stretched out as long as 30 years.

“I don’t think the euro zone is out of the woods,” said Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels, “but Ireland and Portugal have been strengthened. It is much more credible that they can meet their commitments than before.”

Some European officials believe that working with the big banks will help solidify the common currency.

Mr. Véron said that the bank inclusion was needed to make the deal politically plausible. “If the aim was to have a reduction in Greek debt manageable, then it has not been structured effectively,” he said. “But I don’t think that was the main intention.”
596 2011-07-23 Mr. Cameron continued Friday to distance himself from the Murdochs and their newspapers, whose support helped usher him into power just over a year ago, as the scandal continued to raise questions about the close ties between his government and News International executives.

“Clearly, James Murdoch has got questions to answer in Parliament, and I’m sure he will do that,” Mr. Cameron said during a visit to an auto plant in the British Midlands. “And clearly News International has got some big issues to deal with and a mess to clear up. That has to be done by the management of that company. In the end, the management of the company must be an issue for the shareholders of that company, but the government wants to see this sorted out.”

In a week of fast-moving developments, James Murdoch testified that he had not been aware in 2008 of evidence that phone hacking at The News of the World went beyond a single “rogue reporter,” as the company then maintained. A year earlier, a reporter covering the royal family for the paper, , and a private investigator on contract to the paper were convicted of hacking into the voice mail accounts of members of the royal household.

But on Thursday, two executives — , a former editor of The News of the World, and , the company’s former legal manager — said that James Murdoch’s testimony was “mistaken” and that they had in fact shown him evidence of wider phone hacking. Mr. Murdoch immediately denied the assertion, a stance he repeated Friday in an open letter to the chairman of the parliamentary panel.

“Allegations have been made as to the veracity of my testimony to your committee on Tuesday,” he said. “As you know, I was questioned thoroughly and I answered truthfully. I stand by my testimony.”

Mr. Watson, the Labour lawmaker, said the police should look into Mr. Crone’s and Mr. Myler’s assertions. “If their version of events is accurate,” he told the , “it doesn’t just mean that Parliament has been misled, it means the police have another investigation on their hands.”

The British authority that regulates lawyers said Friday that it would formally investigate the role played by lawyers in the hacking scandal. Without naming specific firms, the Solicitors Regulation Authority said it would specifically investigate concerns raised by Mr. Watson.

He asked the authority to review Harbottle & Lewis, a law firm that counts members of the royal family among its clients. Rupert Murdoch has accused the firm of making a “major mistake” in its review of internal News of the World e-mails, some of which, it has since emerged, contain evidence of wrongdoing.

The firm was hired by The News of the World in 2007 to defend it in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by the royalty reporter, Mr. Goodman, who claimed he should not have been fired because other staff members had done similar things.

Harbottle & Lewis was asked to look through about 2,500 e-mails to and from Mr. Goodman, according to News International officials. In a carefully worded May 29, 2007, letter to the company, Lawrence Abramson of the law firm said that the review of e-mails found no evidence that executives knew about hacking. Several company executives have since said that the e-mail did contain signs of other unethical practices, notably police payoffs.

Lord Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions who was hired by News International to help it re-examine the e-mail, has said that the signs of criminality were “blindingly obvious” after a review of just “three to five minutes.”

Harbottle & Lewis, which has been given a release from client confidentiality requirements to answer some questions put by the police and Parliament, did not return a call requesting comment.

602 2011-07-24 Many swimmers — mindful of the American swimmer Fran Crippen’s death last year in a race in similarly warm water — failed to finish the 25-kilometer open-water race at the world championships in Jinshan City, China. The air temperature was 90 degrees with 68 percent humidity by the time the race finished. By that point, 10 of the 29 men who started the race had quit, as had 4 of the 21 female starters. The men’s race was won by Peter Stoychev of Bulgaria, who completed the course in 5 hours 10 minutes 39.8 seconds. He said he felt fine during the race, but when the water temperature hit 88 — the suggested unsafe point for swimming — he said: “No need to discuss. It’s time to end.” The women’s champion was Ana Marcela Cunha of Brazil, who held off Angela Maurer of Germany by a body length in a sprint to the finish. Cunha finished in 5:29.22.9. ¶ Russia completed a gold-medal sweep of the seven events at the synchronized swimming world championships in Shanghai, winning the final event — the team free — to give Natalia Ishchenko her sixth gold medal.
603 2011-07-24 BEIJING — For Chinese authors who join the international writers’ organization PEN, membership would appear to have very few privileges. Many of its members are subjected to frequent harassment; four of them are currently in prison, including one of its founders, Liu Xiaobo, the essayist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate serving 11 years for subversion. All told, the group counts 40 journalists, novelists and historians imprisoned because of their writings.

On Saturday, the authorities once again demonstrated their displeasure with the organization by barring three writers from joining Independent Chinese PEN Center’s 10th anniversary celebration in Hong Kong. Those prevented from attending were Zhuang Daohe, a Hangzhou lawyer and essayist; Jiao Guobiao, a Beijing journalism professor who lost his job after writing a critique of the Communist Party; and Cui Weiping, a poet and film scholar who was to receive an award on Saturday.

Mr. Jiao, like the others, had bought a plane ticket but was prevented from leaving his apartment by a contingent of security agents. “I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this,” Mr. Jiao said in an interview via Skype on Saturday. “It’s getting worse and worse.”

Although writers who refuse to conform to government restrictions have long been persecuted in China, conditions have worsened since February, when the Communist Party began a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent prompted by fears that the pro-democracy protests in the Arab world could spread to China.

Dozens of rights lawyers and critics have been detained, among them the artist Ai Weiwei, who spent nearly three months in custody. The government has accused Mr. Ai of tax evasion, but conventional wisdom suggests his more urgent crime was the frequent and unvarnished criticism he directed at the Communist Party. Since his conditional release last month, Mr. Ai has been conspicuously silent.
604 2011-07-24 FIFA barred Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar from soccer for life after finding him guilty of bribing voters in the election for FIFA’s president.

A FIFA ethics panel ruled in Zurich that the Qatari conspired to pay Caribbean officials $40,000 cash bribes to back his ultimately abandoned challenge to Sepp Blatter, who was re-elected after running unopposed.
605 2011-07-24 But these leaders have not yet breached the underlying concerns about how the federal government manages the water.

Earlier this year, the Missouri Congressional delegation succeeded in stripping financing, after more than $7 million had been spent, from a study of the priorities for river management that was supported by upriver states, arguing that it was redundant and amounted to an attack on navigation.

Even as Ms. McCaskill praised the collaboration in fighting flooding, she noted that she and other leaders from both parties in Missouri remained committed to supporting shipping interests on the river. “While navigation is much more important than recreation, we should not let the fight between navigation and recreation get in the way of flood control,” Ms. McCaskill said.

Her colleagues north of the dams have a different view.

“Frankly, navigation never developed as anticipated,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who called for a revision of how the river was operated. “The basic operational assumptions from the management of the river are really no longer valid.”

Asked about the continued emphasis on navigation despite the sparse traffic, Jody Farhat, the chief of water management for the Missouri River Basin for the Army Corps of Engineers, said: “The primary reason is it’s because it’s the law. The Corps of Engineers does what Congress tells us to do.”

Once wide, shallow and unusually winding, the Missouri River has been drastically reshaped over the last century, at a cost of more than $650 million, to create a channel friendly to modern vessels, according to federal estimates. The result is a narrower, deeper, straighter river, which the government spends about $7 million a year to maintain.

The predictions for boat traffic that were used to justify the spending never materialized. The amount and value of river freight has actually declined sharply since the late 1970s, a few years before the project was finally completed, according to federal data.

Though the river cuts through the heart of farm country, almost no grain is transported on the Missouri — 4.8 million of the 5 million tons of cargo moved by barge last year was sand and gravel, which was usually shipped less than a mile. Traffic upriver from Kansas City all but disappeared.

“They’ve had decades to prove this is worth the expenditure of taxpayer dollars,” said Andrew Fahlund, a vice president for conservation at American Rivers, a conservation organization that has sued over the management of the river.

Even the shipping company of Roger Blaske, whose great-grandfather and every generation since have plied these waters, was one of several on the river to close after years of drought made business even more unpredictable. He was unsure if it would ever again be profitable to work on the waterway.

“I guess it could be,” Mr. Blaske said with a heavy sigh. “It was at one time.”

Some leaders maintain that the industry will revive. In St. Joseph, Mo., where just two barges have visited in the decade since the construction of a $1.3 million port, city leaders insist that the river is still viable as a commerce route.

Just downriver in Kansas City, leaders are looking into reopening a port, with the head of the effort saying he hoped upriver states would not “choke off the opportunity for people below.” And the State of Missouri received $900,000 in federal money to examine how to get more freight on the river.

“The highways are congested, the railways are headed that way, the waterways have capacity,” said Ernest Perry, the freight development administrator for the Missouri transportation department.

Other rivers have shown that shipping can still be viable. Though slower than other forms of transit, river barges are able to carry far larger quantities at a lower cost. Even with aging infrastructure on many major shipping routes — and despite the widespread flooding this year — the business as a whole remains healthy, industry leaders say.

But the Missouri can accommodate fewer barges because of the strong current and sharper bends. And though navigation, along with flood control, gets priority for releases of water from dams, the unpredictable river levels have made shipping contracts riskier.

The most substantial contribution to navigation that the river makes is supplying water to the far busier Mississippi, into which the Missouri empties just north of St. Louis.

Kevin Holcer, a manager for AGRIServices, a Missouri company that sells fertilizer and other agricultural products, said that when the shipping operations they worked with went out of business, the company bought its own tugboat.

“We’re really the only one on the Missouri that’s out here every day for hire,” he said. The current flood shut down river traffic and has caused substantial losses, he added.

Officials with the Army Corps of Engineers have said that the reservoir levels were drawn down to “full flood capacity,” when rain unexpectedly filled the space set aside for snowmelt — forcing the dams to release more water than ever before. Various parties have suggested that more water than necessary was being held back. Corps leaders acknowledge the tension between vacating water for a flood and holding it for other use, but maintain that the guidelines never anticipated a flood of this size.

That defense has not assuaged Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican, who has strongly criticized the Corps of Engineers for not releasing more water sooner. He said he believed that the other uses, like navigation and recreation, distracted from the focus on flood control.

“They’ve lost their way,” Mr. Branstad said. “They’re not doing what the dams were designed to do in the first place. As a result, we’ve suffered significant losses.”
606 2011-07-24 Brian Kammer, a defense lawyer who argued for allowing Mr. DeYoung’s execution to be recorded, said that documenting the death was essential because of the controversy over the drugs used in lethal injections.

“We’ve had three botched lethal injections in Georgia prior to Mr. DeYoung, and we thought it was time to get some hard evidence,” Mr. Kammer said.

Mr. DeYoung, who was convicted of the 1993 murders of his parents and 14-year-old sister, was given a three-drug cocktail, including pentobarbital, a sedative often used to euthanize animals. Critics have argued that the use of pentobarbital represents cruel and unusual punishment.

In pushing for the video, the lawyers argued that there were problems with an execution in June in Georgia that used the drug; the condemned man, Roy Blankenship, was described by a medical expert as jerking, mumbling and thrashing after the injection was administered. According to an account of the execution in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mr. DeYoung “showed no violent signs in death.”

Lawyers for the state attorney general opposed the recording, saying that it would threaten security and that “in this day and age of almost thoughtless dissemination of information, there exists a credible risk of public distribution.”

After Mr. DeYoung’s execution, the video was sealed and sent to a judge’s chambers for safekeeping, and Mr. Kammer, for one, said he hoped it stayed hidden. “It’s a horrible thing that Andrew DeYoung had to go through, and it’s not for the public to see that,” he said.

But Douglas Berman, a professor of law at Ohio State University who commented on the issue on his blog, Sentencing and Law Policy, said, “I think it would be foolish for anybody who is authorizing or supervising the videotaping of executions to assume that it will always remain sealed and unseen.” Mr. Berman added, “Somewhere, somehow, at some point, this will become publicly accessible.”

Whether that development would be beneficial or harmful has for years been a subject of much contention. Deborah W. Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School who is an expert on the death penalty, says videotaping executions is important because it provides objective evidence that is not dependent on eyewitness accounts. The decision to allow the recording of Mr. DeYoung’s death was a sign of the courts’ growing awareness of the need for transparency, Ms. Denno said.

“Presumably,” she said, court officials “are going to act responsibly, and the tape will never see the light of day.” But if such videos become public, she said, it might not be such a bad thing. She noted that television cameras are allowed in courtrooms and that the public can take tours of prisons.

“Most of what we do in the criminal justice system in terms of punishment is something that is allegedly open to the public,” Ms. Denno said, “and this is the ultimate form of our process.”

Mr. Berman was also in favor of opening executions to public scrutiny. “I think that this is the kind of government activity that ought to be publicly known about,” he said. Videos of executions carried out in other countries are readily available on YouTube, he pointed out, as are images of violence of all kinds.

But William Otis, a former chief of the appellate division at the United States attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, said that although he favored the death penalty, the idea of broadcasting executions made him uncomfortable.

“There’s something that I think would give a normal person pause about making readily available pictures of executions,” Mr. Otis said. “Who’s going to watch stuff like that?” He added that if the videos were to be made public, graphic depictions of murders and their effects on victims should go alongside them.

In an execution, “the defendant seems to be so alone and helpless and sympathetic, and in that setting, that’s right,” Mr. Otis said. “He’s a human being, and he’s about to be put to death.” But “to have that out there by itself is misleading,” he added.

Executions in the United States have not always been private. In 1936, the last public hanging was held in an empty lot in Owensboro, Ky., before an estimated 20,000 people.

Starting in the 1800s, said Stuart Banner, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, public taste began to shift away from such executions. “Before that, the whole idea was that this would be a good deterrent,” Mr. Banner said. “People would bring their kids. It was a good moral lesson.”

Complaints about the behavior of the mob — some people laughed and pickpockets roamed the crowds — and concerns about the brutality of public executions eventually put an end to the spectacles. The advent of the gas chamber and the electric chair sealed the event’s privacy: neither could be used outdoors.

But challenges to the closed-door nature of executions continued, most of them unsuccessful. A public television station in San Francisco sued to be allowed to broadcast the execution of Robert Alton Harris at San Quentin in 1992 but lost the suit. Other bids to videotape executions have been turned down by the courts.

Mr. Berman said he was less worried about videos of executions being misused if they became widely available than he was about people becoming indifferent to them.

People might say, “Gosh, it looks like what they did to my pet,” he said.
607 2011-07-24 Some of the options still on the table to raise the debt ceiling, involving smaller packages of spending cuts, might not be sufficient to satisfy S.& P. or Moody’s and Fitch, two other rating agencies that have expressed concern over the debt negotiations.

“I think the market still has confidence that the debt ceiling will be raised in time,” said Terry Belton, head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. “The focus is on downgrade risk.”

A downgrade would raise the government’s borrowing costs, exacerbating its financial problems, because investors generally demand higher interest rates to hold riskier debt. Consumers and businesses also would face higher borrowing costs because the rates on Treasuries are widely used as a benchmark to set the rates on other kinds of loans.

The government cannot borrow more than $14.3 trillion, the current debt ceiling, a limit that it reached in May. Since then, however, Treasury has continued to repay securities as they come due and issue new debt in their place, a process known as rolling over debt. Officials are concerned that it will become harder to find investors willing to participate in the weekly auctions, and that the remaining buyers will begin to demand higher interest rates.

Over the last few weeks staff members in the Office of Debt Management, a part of the Treasury, have been phoning the desks of the 20 major Wall Street dealers for Treasury bonds to assess investor demand for coming debt auctions, and to seek assurances that the dealers themselves will buy any surplus.

About $87 billion in federal debt comes due on Aug. 4, and roughly $410 billion comes due throughout the rest of August. If interest rates climbed even a tenth of a percentage point, the added cost to roll over the debt would be an extra $500 million a year.

Wall Street is also worried about the effect that a ratings downgrade would have on various assets that are implicitly backed by the federal government, including agency mortgages or municipal bonds.

The heightened uncertainty is prompting financial firms and other companies to stockpile cash. Walter Todd of Greenwood Capital, a wealth management firm in Greenwood, S.C., said that so far he had advised his own worried customers not to do the same, operating under the assumption that a deal would be reached. But after the talks fell apart on Friday, Mr. Todd said he and his partners began to discuss a more pessimistic possibility.

“If nothing changes, if the headline out of the weekend is that the talks have broken down, I think you’ll start to see assets reacting to that,” Mr. Todd said. “It blows my mind that it’s come to this. It’s incredibly irresponsible what’s happening, on the part of both sides.”

Other investors said they did not view the opening of markets on Monday as a critical deadline, as they still expected a deal, but that each passing day would put a little more stress on the markets. Bond prices fluctuated last week on the news from Washington, falling Thursday after S.& P.’s latest warning, then rising on Friday amid renewed talk that a deal was imminent.

“Every day without an agreement increases the risk of default,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Company. “Congress likes to go to the edge of the precipice with the debt ceiling, and we are headed toward the edge again.”
608 2011-07-24 Melissa Anne Tebbs and Michael Nicholas Bitalvo were married Saturday at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. The Rev. Joseph Tyrell, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.

609 2011-07-24 Emily Callis Raabe and Paul Josiah Devlin were married Saturday at the home of the bride’s parents in Charlotte, Vt. James W. Murdoch, a friend of the couple who was granted a one-day permission by the Vermont Superior Court to serve as an acting Superior Court judge, officiated.

The bride, 41, writes biographies and children’s books in New York. She is also a poet whose work has appeared in the Indiana Review and other journals. She graduated magna cum laude from Middlebury College and received a master of arts in European literature from Sussex University in England. She also received a master of fine arts in poetry from the California College of Arts and Crafts in San Francisco. She is a candidate for a Ph.D. in literature from the City University of New York.

She is a daughter of Susan Callis Raabe and Dr. Daniel Stauffer Raabe Jr. The bride’s father is a cardiologist in Middlebury, Vt. Her mother is an artist whose paintings were on display in 2009 at the Colburn Gallery at the University of Vermont.

The bridegroom, 48, is an independent filmmaker in New York. He produced, directed and edited the documentaries “Blast,” which appeared last year on PBS; “Power Trip,” which appeared on PBS in 2004; and “SlamNation,” which was on HBO in 2000. He is also a freelance video editor for CBS Sports, and has worked as a video editor on NBC’s Olympic coverage. He graduated from the University of Michigan.

He is a son of Nancy Devlin and Thomas J. Devlin of Philadelphia. The bridegroom’s mother retired as an educational psychologist for the school system in Princeton, N.J. His father, a retired professor of physics at Rutgers, was part of the research team that discovered the atomic particle called the top quark.
610 2011-07-24 Emily Paine and Jonathan Leigh Knickerbocker were married Saturday in Schaghticoke, N.Y. Steven A. Hemstreet, a retired town justice for Schaghticoke, officiated at the Knickerbocker Mansion, built by an ancestor of the bridegroom.

Mrs. Paine Knickerbocker, 31, works in New York as a fabric coordinator for Fishman & Tobin, a manufacturer of children’s clothing based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. She graduated summa cum laude from the Fashion Institute of Technology.

She is a daughter of Joan Erikson Paine and Timothy Daniel Nelson Paine of Grand Junction, Colo. Her parents, both retired, worked in Grand Junction. Her father was an industrial arts teacher at Bookcliff Middle School. Her mother was a medical librarian at St. Mary’s Hospital.

The bride’s first marriage ended in divorce.

Mr. Knickerbocker, 34, is a mathematics teacher at James Hillhouse High School in New Haven. He graduated from Southern Connecticut State University.

He is a son of Charlotte Susanna Knickerbocker and Paul Keith Knickerbocker of Wallingford, Conn. His father is a plant engineering and facilities manager for the Siemon Company, a fiber-optic company in Watertown, Conn.
611 2011-07-24 Lesley Candace Visser and Robert Cranston Kanuth were married Saturday in Cambridge, Mass. The Rev. Dr. Dorothy A. Austin, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony in the Appleton Chapel of the Memorial Church at Harvard.

The bride, 57, will continue to use her name professionally. She is a sportscaster for CBS, for which her assignments have included the N.F.L. and the Kentucky Derby. She is based in Bal Harbour, Fla. In 2006, she became the first woman recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. She graduated from Boston College.

She is a daughter of Max Visser of Hobe Sound, Fla., and the late Mary Visser who lived in South Hadley, Mass. The bride is a stepdaughter of Barbara Visser.

The bridegroom, 64, is an owner of Pelican Bay Suites, a hotel on Grand Bahama Island. He founded Cranston Securities, a brokerage that was in Washington, which he sold in 1987 and where he worked until 1988. He graduated from Harvard.

He is a son of the late Bartell E. Kanuth and the late Robert C. Kanuth, who lived in Columbus, Ohio.

The bride’s prior marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom’s two previous marriages.
612 2011-07-24 You should see the size of my curriculum vita.

My classmates like me —

I just put spinners on my sweet new ride.

That’s why they’re givin’ me the third degree.

I work in a lab with acids and bases.

My new results to be unveiled

Are experiments to show why my experiments failed.

This is my adviser, helpin’ me advance.

All he does is yell and apply for grants.

He wants to know my progress, but I can’t be found.

Uh-oh! Looks like you dropped your grants on the ground!

Grants on the ground, grants on the ground,

Lookin’ like a fool with your grants on the ground.

What the hell was I thinking?

That’s why they’re givin’ me the third degree.

The college kids all disrespect us.

I got no prospects, just my prospectus.

We try to teach ’em how to search print media,

But they all just copy Wikipedia.

Don’t beg for points, or you’ll regret it.

We bet on who’s cheatin’­ — yeah, we proctor and gamble.

Takin’ student loans just to have some money.

Payin’ them off ’til my kids are 20.

Hey, just think of this as 23rd grade.

Please don’t take away my stipend,

If I try to stay mellow,

I can start my career — as a post-doctoral fellow.
613 2011-07-24 A decade ago, Yuko Arii, a 34-year-old entrepreneur from Tokyo with an easy laugh and flawless English, might well have studied business in Cambridge, Mass., or Hanover, N.H. But an American M.B.A. never crossed her mind, she says. Her aspiration “has always been to bring Japanese companies overseas,” and she felt that a European school would offer better guidance in accessing markets across the world. Ms. Arii opted to pursue an M.B.A. at the European Institute of Business Administration, or Insead, which has boldly trademarked the phrase “The Business School for the World.”

Tucked in the woods of the chateau town of Fontainebleau, not far from Paris, Insead was founded in 1957 as a sort of Harvard Business School for Europe as the Continent emerged from the ravages of the Second World War and began to create what is now the European Union. Incoming students were originally required to speak French, English and German, with courses taught in each; since the 1990s, classes have been conducted only in English, though students must speak at least one other language to enter the M.B.A. program, and to graduate must learn a third “commercially useful” language — say, French, Spanish, Mandarin or Russian.

Less than a mile from the 12th-century Château de Fontainebleau, the small campus is spotted with airy modern structures; many students come with spouses and children, and the school offers no long-term housing on campus. Services are limited to a library, bookshop, fitness center, and cafe and bar. (Students and administrators are fond of pointing out that M.B.A. participants come to study, not to play Frisbee or party.)

Only 20 percent of Insead students are native English speakers; this year, in keeping with the recent trend, no one nationality represents more than 10 percent of the student body. In contrast, even at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale, Ariz., with an international business M.B.A. that is often ranked best in the world, more than half the student body is American.

There is an “American type of international,” Ms. Arii says, and there is Europe.

American students tend to stay close to home. Almost 98 percent sent their GMAT scores last year to American business schools. American schools are still the top recipients of all GMAT score reports — 78 percent of them from around the world. But that figure is down from 83 percent in 2006, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the test. A GMAC report attributes the slip to growing interest in business schools in India, Singapore, the United Kingdom and France. Last year, nearly twice as many prospective students, many of them from India and China, sent scores to European schools. And while Europeans sent fully half their score reports to American schools in 2006, in 2010, just 37 percent were sent.

“It’s not the fall of the U.S., but the rise of the rest,” offers Dipak C. Jain, the dean of Insead.

“As globalization increased, European schools became much more global, both in terms of curriculum and in terms of diversity,” he says. American schools are often “super-proud” of student bodies in which one-third are international, says Dr. Jain, who was dean at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University until 2009. In classes at Insead, he says merrily, “it looks like the United Nations.”

Dr. Jain was himself born in India, where he studied before moving to the United States as a professor and gaining American citizenship. He began as dean at Insead earlier this year. (Perhaps tellingly, he arrived speaking not a word of French.)

Where M.B.A. students at Insead study businesses and business practices from around the world, American curriculums tend to be “very U.S.-centric,” he says, with case studies focused on domestic corporations. A more global outlook might in fact run counter to the fundamental appeal of American schools, he suggests. “The attraction for the U.S. is, people go there to work with the Americans,” he says. “So for U.S. schools, if they become completely international they would lose their competitive advantage.”

Interest in international business has paralleled the growth of multinational corporations over the past two decades, analysts say. Competitive business schools have emerged outside the United States in response to a need for managers “who can function across cultural boundaries and legal boundaries,” says Mr. Trapnell. It wasn’t until 1996 that his association offered accreditation to a non-North American school, Essec in Paris.

“From that, really, the floodgates began to be opened,” he says.

Of the 620 schools accredited by AACSB International, about 120 are outside the United States and Canada. Among the top-ranked institutions worldwide are the London Business School, the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland and those better known by their acronyms: Insead, Essec and H.E.C. in France; I.E. and the I.E.S.E. Business School in Spain.

European M.B.A. programs were once a confounding tangle of degree systems across the Continent. But a decade ago, European leaders began the Bologna Process, which aims to institute a unified three-cycle higher education system — with separate programs for bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees and doctorates. Of the 47 nations that have backed the process, many had previously offered combined bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

As a result, institutions that had once offered five-year business degrees have created standalone master’s programs. Last year, GMAC estimated that there are now about 1,670 such programs in Europe.

Dr. Jain says that the “No. 1 attraction point” is the relatively quick nature of the European M.B.A. — most can be completed in a year or less. While there are one-year M.B.A.’s in the United States, most take two years.

“As you know, time is very precious,” Dr. Jain says, noting that many students take a leave of absence from a job, and a one-year hiatus is more acceptable to employers and students than two.

The academic rhythm is grueling, though. At Insead, classes usually begin at 8:30 a.m. and often do not end until 7 p.m., with tutorials on Saturdays. Students typically finish their degree in just 10 months, completing an estimated 80 percent of the course hours of a traditional M.B.A. program — almost two years of learning compressed into less than one.

“Particularly in the beginning, it is really intense,” says Brendan Gotch, a 27-year-old from Connecticut who graduated from New York University before working at Massey Knakal, a commercial real estate agency.

Mr. Gotch spoke with a visitor in a grassy courtyard on Insead’s all-but-silent campus, on a rare break from classes. During the week, students are scarcely to be seen outside the classroom: there is little time for anything but schoolwork. Students treat their time at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, which is part of Insead’s eight-week exchange program, as a “vacation,” says Mr. Gotch.

Fans of American schools say they provide deeper grounding in a wider range of the skills required for success. And European programs do not generally include internships, they note, which graduates of American schools consistently rate as being among the most formative elements of their M.B.A. experiences.

In contrast to the technical vision of business knowledge that predominates in the United States, European schools emphasize relationship skills in instruction. “The Europeans have a more personal, less numbers-driven approach to business,” says Mr. Trapnell, of AACSB International. “The relationship is critical.”

For the executives that the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth hopes to breed, it will not be enough to know a single specialty, says Christie St.-John, senior associate director of admissions and recruiting. They will also need to be versed in finance and marketing, to understand organizational structuring and to know how to manage supply chains.

“There’s a lot you can’t get in one year,” she says. “I think probably one-year programs are fine for midlevel people who want to stay in the same industry, but we actually are looking for people who anticipate being much, much more. They want to branch out, they want to eventually run their own company, or run the company they might be working for.

“And to do that,” she says, “you’ve got to know everything about how every single part of that company works with the other parts.”

Tuck offers semester-length exchange programs with 26 foreign business schools. Still, just 15 percent of students participated last year, Ms. St.-John says. On average, about 35 percent of Tuck’s student body is international.

Acknowledging the global business environment, many top American schools, including Babson, Harvard and Wharton, are adding more international emphasis. Wharton, for example, has recently introduced concentrations in global finance and management, and a series of “global modular courses” offered in and out of the country. The class of 2012 is 36 percent international.

That percentage, however, might not impress Christine de Wendel, 31, who graduated from Insead in December. She was born to a French mother and Austrian father but was raised in Atlanta.

Holding passports from three nations, she assumed she would be an exception at Insead, as she had been as an undergraduate at Georgetown University; she was quickly disabused of that notion.

“All the clichés about Insead are absolutely true,” says Ms. de Wendel, who was a management consultant at Bain & Company before pursuing an M.B.A. She is now head of purchasing at the French branch of Zalando, an online retailer.

At Insead, she says, she regularly faced challenges rooted in the “very different working styles” of different nationalities. A team project, for example, might spiral into arguments over how best to approach a problem, informed by each student’s culture.

In the United States, Ms. de Wendel says, “you definitely don’t get the guy from Kazakhstan screaming at the guy from Japan screaming at the guy from South Africa.”
614 2011-07-24 Two months afterward, she had a rainbow sticker on her car and her first girlfriend.

By spring 2007, she was living in Jersey City and working in Brooklyn for the New York City Teaching Fellows, a program that places teachers in schools in poor neighborhoods. In addition to being a fellow, Ms. Wood interviewed applicants. She also had a growing crush on her boss, Alissa Ginsberg, who oversaw the selection process. “I liked her sense of humor,” Ms. Wood said. “She was sarcastic, and so smart. She made me think about things in a different way, and that was cool.”

Friends describe Ms. Ginsberg, now 28, as a perfectionist who can be hilarious and hapless. At work, all of her files are color-coded, and when she speaks, her sentences are crisp, grammatical and complete. “At one point in her life, she wanted to be a dental hygienist because she liked the idea of lining up all the instruments on those skinny drawers that dentists use,” said her mother, Erika Hoff.

Yet she also loves to travel to faraway places with a one-way ticket and no itinerary. “Alissa has this combination of order and disorder,” Ms. Hoff said.

Ms. Wood did not know if Ms. Ginsberg was straight or not but asked her out anyway. As it turned out, Ms. Ginsberg, who grew up in the Midwest and Florida, had dated only men. She had never thought of herself as being attracted to women — until she met Ms. Wood. She liked her smile and was amazed by her ability to throw her off at staff meetings.

“Julie always asked the questions I was never prepared for, and forced me to think on my feet,” Ms. Ginsberg said.

She added: “When she asked me out, I was so excited. The Cubbyhole was the only gay bar I knew of in the city, so I mentioned it.” The Cubbyhole, in Greenwich Village, happened to be one of Ms. Wood’s favorite hangouts.

Ms. Ginsberg, always punctual, arrived first, wearing a dress. She and Ms. Wood, who wore khakis, talked mainly about their shared passion for providing a good education to disadvantaged children.

“It was the best date I’d been on in a very long time,” Ms. Ginsberg said. “I was so nervous but still really comfortable.”

Ms. Wood remembered, “She didn’t seem to want to be impressive. She just wanted to be herself and be real.”

After a few hours, they went around the corner to another bar. “We went over to the jukebox to put on some music, and that was the first time I put my arms around her,” Ms. Ginsberg said. “I made the first move. I remember standing there like, ‘All right, here goes nothing!’ She didn’t pull away.”

That night, Ms. Wood drove Ms. Ginsberg home to Brooklyn, and they kissed on the steps of Ms. Ginsberg’s brownstone. “My heart was beating so quickly!” Ms. Ginsberg recalled. “Our first kiss was amazing. There was none of that awkwardness, none of that, ‘Oh well, we’re going to have to work on this.’ ”

Their relationship became serious quickly, partly because they balance each other so well. Ms. Ginsberg doesn’t mind heights, waiting in lines, vacuuming or killing mice; Ms. Wood hates those things. Ms. Ginsberg lives in the moment; Ms. Wood has her eye on 20 years from now.

“Alissa is generally joyous and helps me take a break from being serious,” Ms. Wood said. “She makes monkey faces, tells me bad jokes, uses voices and is just really fun and excited most of the time.”

Ms. Ginsberg also never experienced the self-doubt or angst that Ms. Wood did over being in love with a woman. And when she told friends and relatives about Ms. Wood, it was almost anticlimactic.

“One day I had a boyfriend, and the next day I had a girlfriend,” she said. “No one blinked.”

After a year, Ms. Wood brought up the subject of marriage. “I grew up always wanting to be married,” she said. “My parents have been married for 40 years. My grandparents, both sets, were married almost 50 years.” She added: “Marriage is sacred. It’s the highest recognition of a relationship.”

Ms. Ginsberg was not ready. “I shut that down really quickly,” she said.

As a compromise, they moved in together — first in Jersey City, then in Brooklyn — and found they were even more compatible than they had thought. “We cook together,” Ms. Ginsberg said. “I walk the dog in the morning, she walks the dog in the afternoon. We both like a lot of bookshelves.”

“They don’t always agree but they know how to disagree well,” said Ms. Wood’s mother, Susan Wood.

After Ms. Wood came out, it took her parents years to metabolize the news. But as her mother said, “in the end, we feel that religion is all about love.”

After they had lived together for a year, Ms. Wood once again brought up marriage. By then, Ms. Ginsberg wanted to get married as much as Ms. Wood, but for different reasons. Marrying, she said, meant she could “shout from the rooftops that this is the person I love!”

She was the one who formally proposed. Not everyone celebrated the engagement. “We went through a series of losses for me,” Ms. Wood, now a special education teacher at the Young Women’s Leadership School of Brooklyn, wrote in an e-mail. “I had to resign as a mentor from a Christian youth organization I had worked with for three years, because I wasn’t willing to take off my engagement ring when I was with the girls.”

Ms. Ginsberg, now the director of selection for the New York City Teaching Fellows, believes that marriage gives couples a glue they cannot manufacture in any other way. “The process of formalizing the bond strengthens the bond,” she said.

The two women originally planned to have their legal ceremony on July 6 in Connecticut. But when the same-sex marriage bill was approved in New York State last month, they made plans to legally marry on Aug. 5 at the City Clerk’s office in Brooklyn.

“I love living in Brooklyn,” Ms. Ginsberg said. “I love the community, and for me to be able to celebrate my relationship within my own community is extremely powerful.”

On July 9, they had a religious ceremony at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Morristown, N.J. “It was hugely important to me to get married in a church,” Ms. Wood said.

The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Janet Broderick, a friend of Ms. Wood’s and a sister of the actor Matthew Broderick.

At this wedding, about 60 guests watched as the brides walked together down the long aisle — Ms. Ginsberg in a wedding gown, Ms. Wood in a pantsuit.

During their procession, Ms. Wood’s father, Nicholas Wood, played Pachelbel’s “Canon in D Major” on the organ. In her vows, Ms. Wood promised to “kill the bugs, do the laundry and be patient” and Ms. Ginsberg vowed to “apologize when I’m wrong and even sometimes when I’m right.”
615 2011-07-24 In this column I want to look at a not uncommon way of writing and structuring books. This approach, I will argue, involves the writer announcing at the outset what he or she will be doing in the pages that follow. The default format of academic research papers and textbooks, it serves the dual purpose of enabling the reader to skip to the bits that are of particular interest and — in keeping with the prerogatives of scholarship — preventing an authorial personality from intruding on the material being presented. But what happens when this basically plodding method seeps so deeply into a writer’s makeup as to constitute a stylistic signature, even a kind of ongoing flourish or extravagance?

Before continuing I will say something here about how I was drawn to this area of research. In the course of writing an article about the photographer Thomas Struth, I remembered that the highly regarded art historian Michael Fried had a chapter on Struth in his book “Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before” (2008), henceforth WP. I’d read only a little of Fried before, but I knew that his earlier “Absorption and Theatricality: Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot” (1980) was regularly referred to and quoted by art historians. I will show later that one of those art historians is Fried himself, but as soon as I started to consult WP I realized I was reading something quite extraordinary: a masterpiece of its kind in that it takes the style of perpetual announcement of what is about to happen to extremes of deferment that have never been seen before. Imminence here becomes immanent.

I’ll come to the rest of the book later. Here I will simply remark that the first page of Fried’s introduction summarizes what he intends to do and ends with a summary of this summary: “This is what I have tried to do in ‘Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before.’ ” The second page begins with another look ahead: “The basic idea behind what follows. . . . ” Fair enough, that’s what introductions are for, and it’s no bad thing to be reassured that the way in which the overall argument will manifest itself “in individual cases will become clear in the course of this book.” Page 3 begins: “The organization of ‘Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before’ is as follows. . . . ” Well, O.K. again, even if it is a bit like watching a rolling news program: Coming up on CNN . . . A look ahead to what’s coming up on CNN. . . . More striking is the way that even though we have only just got going — even though, strictly speaking, we have not got going — Fried is already looking back (Previously on “NYPD Blue” . . . ) on what he did in such earlier books as “Art and Objecthood” and “Absorption and Theatricality.” The present book will not be like those earlier ones, however, “as the reader of ‘Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before’ is about to discover.”

What the reader discovers, however, is that Fried will continue to announce what he’s about to do right to the end: “Later on in this book I shall examine . . . ”; “I shall discuss both of these after considering . . . ”; “I shall also be relating. . . . ” Fried’s brilliance, however, is that in spite of all the time spent looking ahead and harking back he also — and it’s this that I want to emphasize here — finds the time to tell you what he’s doing now, as he’s doing it: “But again I ask . . . ” ; “Let me try to clarify matters by noting . . . ”; “What I want to call attention to. . . . ” But that’s not all: the touch of genius is that on top of everything else he somehow manages to tell you what he is not doing (“I am not claiming that . . . ”), what he has not done (“What I have not said . . . ”) and what he is not going to do (“This is not the place for . . . ”). On occasions he combines several of these tropes in dazzling permutations like the negative-­implied-­forward and the double-­backward — “So far I have said nothing in this conclusion about Barthes’s ‘Camera Lucida,’ which in Chapter 4 I interpreted as a consistently antitheatrical text even as I also suggested . . . ” — before reverting, a paragraph later, to the tense endeavor of the present (i.e., telling us what he’s still got to do): “One further aspect of Barthes’s text remains to be dealt with.” There is, I would observe here, a kind of zero-sum perfection about the way the theatricality of the flamboyant, future-­oriented sign-­posting is matched by all the retrospection. The depths of self-­absorption that makes this possible are hard to fathom.

It could be argued that this is essentially an academic habit, and that Fried is faithfully observing the expected conventions — so faithfully that he has become an unconscious apostate. If academia elevates scholarly and impersonal inquiry above the kind of nutty, fictional, navel-gazing monologues of Nicholson Baker, then Fried is at once its high camp apotheosis and its disintegration into mere manner.

Lest you think I have been quoting unfairly, take a break here and run your eyes over a couple of pages of WP in a library or bookstore. You’ll be amazed. You’ll see that this is some of the most self-­worshiping — or, more accurately, self-­serving — prose ever written. I kept wondering why an editor had not scribbled “get on with it!” in huge red letters on every page of the manuscript — and then I realized that the cumulative flimflam was the it! And at that moment, as I hope to show, everything changed.
616 2011-07-24 While researching the Marquis de Sade several years ago, I came across an intriguing biographical tidbit: that crazed French libertine, whose string of luridly violent works gave rise to the term “sadism,” actually began his literary career as a travel writer. In 1775, Sade embarked on a yearlong grand tour of Italy, and wrote an enormous (and enormously tedious) manuscript about the journey entitled “Voyage d’Italie.” The rambling opus, filled with ruminations on Florentine museums and Neapolitan customs, was never completed. Sade’s attention wandered to more carnal pleasures, and in 1777, he was arrested for a long list of unsavory imbroglios, including one that historians call the Little Girls Episode. Sade was thrown into the prison of Vincennes, and would spend most of his remaining life incarcerated. “Voyage d’Italie” soon joined a range of half-finished manuscripts from his youth, scraps of verse and staid dramatic pieces, none of which Sade ever had the discipline to bring to fruition.

From a strictly literary point of view, prison was the best thing that ever happened to the marquis. It was only behind bars that Sade was able to knuckle down and compose the imaginative works upon which his enduring, if peculiar, reputation lies.

Sade’s most impressive stint began after 1784, when he was transferred to the Bastille, which effectively operated as a literary colony on a par with Yaddo today. From a suite decorated with his own furniture and 600-book library (and tended by his valet), the marquis entered a mind-boggling frenzy of writing, cranking out thousands of manuscript pages at breakneck speed. As Francine du Plessix Gray describes in her classic biography “At Home With the Marquis de Sade,” he completed the first draft of his pornographic novel “Justine” in a single two-week-long burst, and knocked out the final 250,000-word draft of “The 120 Days of Sodom” in 37 days, transcribing minuscule letters on five-inch-wide pages glued into a roll nearly 50 feet long. By 1788, after only 11 years behind bars, Sade had churned out 8 novels and story collections, 16 historical novellas, 2 volumes of essays, a diary and some 20 plays. Whatever you make of Sade’s oeuvre, you have to envy his productivity.

Literary distraction seems a very modern problem. These days, distracted writers tend to blame the Internet, whose constant temptations shred our attention spans, fragment every minute and reduce us to a permanent state of anxiety, checking e-mail every 30 seconds — “like masturbating monkeys,” a writer friend once put it, a phrase of which Sade himself might have approved. But history is filled with writers who, like the marquis, could function only in extreme — and involuntary — isolation.

“A prison is indeed one of the best workshops,” Colette declared. She wasn’t speaking metaphorically. In the early 1900s, by her own account, her caddish first husband had stashed her in a tiny room for four hours a day, refusing to let her out until she had finished a requisite number of pages — a drastic measure, but one that resulted in a novel a year for six years. “What I chiefly learned was how to enjoy, between four walls, almost every secret flight,” she later recalled, sounding almost sentimental.

The peripatetic Marco Polo got around to recording his classic travels through China only because he was captured in 1298 during a naval battle with Genoa and held in a lavish palazzo. Five hundred years later, the playboy Giacomo Casanova found time for his renowned erotic autobiography only after he had run out of money (and libido) and retreated to Castle Dux in Bohemia, where he accepted a sinecure as a librarian. Napoleon Bonaparte dictated his multivolume memoir — one of the great best sellers of 19th-century France — thanks only to his long exile on St. Helena. Even the harsh public jails could induce results. In 1897, Oscar Wilde wrote the philosophical essay “De Profundis” while locked up in Reading Gaol on charges of “unnatural acts.” And in 1942, Jean Genet wrote his first novel, “Our Lady of the Flowers,” while in Fresnes prison, near Paris, for petty theft, scrawling on scraps of paper.

It has become a distraction for the software giant — one that costs shareholders dearly. The division that houses Bing lost $2.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Facebook, or even Apple, might make a better home for Bing. A sale would be a boon for Microsoft’s investors.

Microsoft has been pouring money into Bing. The company thinks search makes its offerings in everything from mobile phones to business software more compelling. Perhaps, but there is little evidence to date. And Bing and sites it powers like Yahoo still control only about 27 percent of the United States market; Google has more than twice as much.

Advertisers do not want a monopoly in search, which should assure Bing of future revenue. And Google may be partly hamstrung as a competitor by antitrust inquiries worldwide. But the business has more value to a buyer that could bring it traffic.

How much? Microsoft’s online services unit, of which Bing is the main component, had $2.5 billion of sales in the year that ended June 30. Google is valued at about six times sales. At a 25 percent discount to Google, the unit would be worth about $11 billion.

Moreover, there are potential buyers. Facebook already works with Bing. It might be interested in buying the site, keeping more traffic onsite, and perhaps using its data to better tweak search results. That would be a potent weapon in its fight with Google, which recently introduced a rival social network, Google+. Apple might even be interested, given its growing online ambitions, evidenced by its consideration of a bid for Hulu.
638 2011-07-25 On Saturday, Riverkeeper said that Thursday’s samples at 6 of 16 test locations in the Hudson, from the Tappan Zee Bridge down to New York City’s Battery, had unsafe counts ranging from 132 to 104,620 per 100 milliliters. “The concentrations near the discharge points were much higher than usual, comparable to the Gowanus Canal and Newtown Creek,” Dr. O’Mullan said.

Gowanus and Newtown, among the most contaminated bodies of water in the nation, were both declared federal Superfund sites last year and are to undergo decade-long cleanups.

The city’s own sampling Thursday showed much lower concentrations because the testing is done at beaches and in the center of the river, Mr. Sklerov said.

Health advisories remain in effect for South, Midland and Cedar Grove Beaches on Staten Island and Sea Gate in Brooklyn. Mr. Sklerov said he expected the advisories to be lifted soon.

Riverbank State Park, which sits atop the treatment plant and lost power during the episode, opened its gates Friday. The swimming pools reopened Saturday morning.

Mr. Lipscomb, 57, said that though the levels near the plant were the highest he had seen, previous testing had shown more widespread sewage contamination along the Hudson after rains.

Mr. Lipscomb has been patrolling the river since 2000 — and sampling its waters since 2006 — from the Riverkeeper boat, which is equipped with a minilab and incubator that allows for on-site analysis of the samples.

To prevent sewage plants from becoming overwhelmed when it rains, he explained, a combined flow of sewage and storm water is frequently discharged untreated into the city’s waterways from hundreds of pipes around the city. After rains in May, Riverkeeper’s sampling, which is done in partnership with Queens College and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, found that levels at 15 of 20 locations tested in the Hudson violated federal water-quality standards.

“This event made for a few bad days,” Mr. Lipscomb said of the outpouring from the North River plant. “But we see bad days throughout the year.”

Mr. Lipscomb, a full-time Riverkeeper employee who was born in New York City and grew up by the Hudson in Irvington in Westchester County, describes his mission as “working for the river.” When he is not testing the waters, he is out on patrol in what resembles a wooden lobster boat, ready to spot and report polluters, in many cases industrial scofflaws who drop scrap metal and other materials into the river as they load and unload cargo.

As someone who has seen plenty, he was philosophical about the fire that caused the North River plant to shut down. “Accidents happen,” he said.

Given its organic nature, the sewage is expected to break down and dissipate in a few days with no lasting effects. Mr. Lipscomb was more worried about the risk of illness to people who came in contact with the water and the need for better notification of the dangers.

The river looked empty during a reporter’s Friday afternoon ride along the Upper West Side to the plant at West 137th Street, but Mr. Lipscomb and Dr. O’Mullan said they had come across people in the water and on the rocks near the Little Red Lighthouse under the George Washington Bridge. “Why isn’t there a traffic cop or somebody telling people not to go in the water?” Mr. Lipscomb asked.

The river was quiet in the 100-degree heat, with just a boat here and there.

The Riverkeeper vessel approached one of the outfall pipes between West 125th Street and the West 79th Street Boat Basin, under a sign reading “Caution: Wet Weather Discharge Point.”

Dr. O’Mullan dropped to his knees to scoop up a water sample with a plastic bottle, while Mr. Lipscomb pointed at the water, saying, “Do you see the water color change to gray?”

It is the discoloration that gives away the presence of sewage, not the smell, he said.

Then there were the ubiquitous “floatables”: leaves, wrappers, a plastic bottle, a condom, the last of which Mr. Lipscomb identified as a telltale sign of sewage.

“Condoms are a perfect example of a direct link between the toilet and the river,” he said dryly as he peered through binoculars.
639 2011-07-25 His family and the board of his company are sorry as well, but that will probably not end up meaning much. The protective instincts of the family were on broad display last week. James sought to leap in front of every hard question while Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi, inserted herself into the fray when someone tried to shove a shaving cream pie at her husband. She has a mean right hook.

Rupert has his own protective streak when it comes to his family, and has gone to great lengths to make them central to the News Corporation’s success structure. But what his sons and daughters could soon find out is that if Mr. Murdoch is forced to choose between the family and the company he has built, he will choose the News Corporation.

“Rupert may end up having to make a choice between his son and the company, which is fairly biblical,” said a friend of the family who works in the media business and who declined to be identified when speaking about private family matters.

James Murdoch is done. He and his father both know that. His testimony curdled as he emitted it, and within two days a couple of former News Corporation executives publicly challenged it. The hooks are still in him, as Prime Minister made clear when he said James still had “questions to answer.” And so he will, gradually sinking further into the mess he has overseen.

Oddly, the News Corporation’s stock began to tick up during the hearings as Rupert Murdoch testified, his large hands thumping as he dropped them to the table. But it was less about his performance than about the clear message that emerged: an era had ended. The family business is splintering. If James is out, as would seem to be the case, will his other offspring, Elisabeth and Lachlan, come swinging into view? I and others doubt that the charms of a global media enterprise being run as a corner grocery store will continue.

While the family reign seems certain to , the News Corporation’s own fortunes are less predictable. A report by the analyst Michael Nathanson of Nomura Capital Investments nicely captured the moment. The market does not care if you have done bad things; it cares when you get caught.

“While we remain disappointed by the actions of a muckraking newspaper and frustrated that perhaps the least-valuable asset in the News Corp. portfolio could cause this much value destruction,” Mr. Nathanson wrote, “we continue to believe that the risk/reward for News Corp. investors remains positive.”

Reached later by phone, Mr. Nathanson suggested that the News Corporation had been cornered into doing the right thing, after doing a lot of not-so-right things. The fact that the company moved swiftly to buy back its stock — approving $5 billion of the oodles of cash the company has on hand — calmed the markets, if not the troubled waters that the company finds itself in.

“The loss of the deal is significant and not good for the company, but in the long term, I think this will force the company to take a hard look at where they are putting capital,” he said, referring to the company’s abandoned bid for British Sky Broadcasting, ’s most lucrative satellite television network.

Historically, Mr. Murdoch has used the digital and broadcast parts of his empire to make money, and the more quotidian assets — newspapers, family influence and raw political power — to create running room for the rest of the organization. That was fine as far as it went.

The hacking scandal changed the dynamics. Suddenly, Mr. Murdoch’s fetish for newspapers looked like an ill-advised indulgence. The News Corporation’s prized relationships with 10 Downing Street and became liabilities, with all of the coziness on view for inspection. It speaks to the scale of the drama and the company that it is almost an afterthought that the government of Britain hangs in the balance.

Perhaps most significantly, Mr. Murdoch has lost the ability to punish, which has been his lever of power for so many years. People are suggesting what has long been on their minds, which is that having one man control so much of the conversation can’t be good for anyone besides him.

His support structure is badly damaged as well.  , the former chief executive, and Gary Ginsberg, the former communications executive, had both left the company. flew in from to back up his father, but he won’t choose this moment to show up on his father’s behalf.

Elisabeth may end up in the middle things, but why would she choose to grab the baton when it is on fire? The best case is that Chase Carey, deputy chairman, president and chief operating officer — who has been stored behind glass for the duration of the scandal — will grab the tiller until things calm down.

“The board has talked and will continue to talk about Rupert stepping aside as C.E.O. and serving as chairman with Chase Carey becoming chief executive, but Rupert would never do that at the point of gun,” said a person who is close to both Mr. Murdoch and the board. “Not in a million years. Not in two million years. Six months, nine months or a year from now, that may happen, but it will not happen in the current circumstances.”

In his testimony, Mr. Murdoch was frank about his objective for the day, beyond making a well-coached — and perhaps deeply felt — apology for the sins of those in his employ. He deflected responsibility for the whole mess, suggesting that he had been betrayed by those who worked for him and that he was as offended as the rest of us. When pressed, he suggested that the man to get to the bottom of all of it was the man who had enabled much of it in the first place.

“I think that, frankly, I’m the best person to clean this up.”

Others may not agree.

The board members of the News Corporation have watched the free fall with an increasing sense of doom. They could not be blamed for finding it difficult to get their arms around the concept of a News Corporation absent Rupert Murdoch. But now the laws of men, and not some ticking clock on Rupert Murdoch’s health, have brought other questions into play.

How is it that Mr. Murdoch, the ultimate deal guy, got clobbered by John Malone, his former partner in DirecTV. True, as the result of the DirecTV deal, he increased family control of the business he runs, but how is that good for the shareholders? Mr. Murdoch was hailed as a visionary when he bought — by me among others — but that did not end up working out so well. He gets for getting his hands on The , but at what price? At $5.6 billion, he looked less like a businessman in pursuit of an asset and more like a compulsive shopper who couldn’t resist the bauble in the window.

And his decision to buy Shine, the company owned by his daughter, looked like checkbook nepotism and nothing more. It could end up making sense if she winds up running the company, but in terms of pure economics? Not so much.

Mr. Murdoch is suddenly, deeply mortal. And the questions that I am asking will be asked by others as well. It’s not just James who is done. Rupert Murdoch, as we have long known him, is done as well.
640 2011-07-25 NEW DELHI — India’s best-known Islamic seminary ousted its reformist leader on Sunday, less than seven months after he assumed the post, because he was quoted as speaking favorably of a Hindu nationalist suspected of fomenting deadly anti-Muslim riots.

The reformer, Mullah Ghulam Mohammed Vastanvi, was appointed in January to lead the seminary, Darul Uloom, in the city of Deoband in Uttar Pradesh State. He had become popular in part because of the success of his madrasas, or Islamic schools, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra that bridged traditional Islamic education with the needs of the modern world by teaching students secular subjects like science and computer programming. He had hoped to bring those innovations to Darul Uloom.

But the effort was almost immediately derailed when he was quoted in an Urdu newspaper as saying that Muslims in Gujarat State needed to move beyond the 2002 sectarian riots there, one of the worst eruptions of religious violence since colonial India was partitioned in 1947. Hindus rampaged through Muslim areas of Gujarat, leaving about 1,000 people dead and leading to reprisals in some areas.

English-language newspapers and television stations in India portrayed Mullah Vastanvi’s remarks as implicitly condoning the actions of Narendra Modi, the controversial leader of Gujarat’s government. Many Muslims blame Mr. Modi for the 2002 violence.

Mullah Vastanvi denied that he had been praising Mr. Modi. Even so, he was swiftly suspended from his seminary post. And on Sunday, 9 of the 14 members of the council that oversees the seminary voted to request his resignation. He refused, and was then dismissed by the council, which appointed one of its members, Mullah Abdul Qasim Nomani, as his replacement.

“I am saying goodbye to Darul Uloom,” a visibly upset Mullah Vastanvi said afterward. “I will continue my association, and keep on serving Deoband.” He remains a member of the seminary’s council.
641 2011-07-25 ¶Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal, which is majority owned by Comcast, consolidated media planning and buying assignments, with spending estimated at $1.4 billion, after a review precipitated by Comcast’s acquisition of control of NBCUniversal. The duties were consolidated with agencies owned by the Publicis Groupe and WPP. The agencies that are being dismissed, which previously worked with NBC and Universal Studios, include Horizon Media and OMD, part of the Omnicom Group; they had teamed up for a review that ended on Thursday with the decision to consolidate at the Publicis and WPP agencies. The Publicis agencies involved include MediaVest and Starcom. The WPP agencies involved, from its GroupM unit, include Maxus and MediaCom, which continues to work on media duties outside the United States.

¶Martin Beck, executive vice president for Central and Eastern Europe at Y&R, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP, was named chief operating officer of Europe, the Middle East and Africa as part of a reorganization. Jaime Prieto, who had been chief executive for the region, is leaving, the agency said, to take on a worldwide role at another agency owned by WPP. The region will be divided into Central and Eastern Europe; the Middle East and Africa; and Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Each of those will be led by its own chief executive.

¶Jack Modzelewski, president for client relations at Fleishman-Hillard, part of the Omnicom Group, was named to a new post, president for the Americas. Regional presidents like Steve Hardwick, who leads the Eastern region, and J. J. Carter, who was newly named to lead the Western region in addition to being general manager of the agency’s San Francisco operation, will report to Mr. Modzelewski; the regional presidents had previously reported to Dave Senay, president and chief executive.

¶Mayra Bacik, chief financial officer at Zapwater Communications, Chicago, was named the agency’s first partner.

¶Ivy Ross joined Art.com Inc., Emeryville, Calif., in a new post, chief merchandising officer, leading merchandising, branding and public relations for the company’s three brands: Art.com, Allposters.com and ArtistRising.com. She had most recently been executive vice president for marketing for the Gap division of Gap Inc., San Francisco.
642 2011-07-25 Russ Cochran toasted a family victory at the Senior British Open on Sunday, capturing his first major title — with his son as caddie — to maintain the United States’ recent dominance of the tournament.

Cochran shot a second straight five-under 67 in the final round at Walton Heath in Walton on the Hill, England, to win by two shots over his compatriot Mark Calcavecchia. Cochran’s 25-year-old son, Reed, carried his bag.

“He relaxed me out there,” Cochran said of Reed, who is on his summer break from law school. “He made me smile and was great to be with.”

Cochran, who finished at 12 under, became the eighth player from the United States in the last nine years to win the Senior British Open.

He made six birdies in the first 10 holes — two on the first two — to open up a five-shot lead as Calcavecchia, who shared the overnight lead with Cochran and David Frost of South Africa, dropped back by four-putting from 15 feet on the par-3 No. 9.

The 61-year-old Tom Watson, looking for a record fourth Open title, rolled back the years with a vintage 67 to finish tied for third with the 2010 runner-up Corey Pavin at nine under — leaving the United States with the top four placings.

O’HAIR TAKES CANADIAN OPEN Sean O’Hair won the Canadian Open in Vancouver, British Columbia, after tapping in for bogey on the first playoff hole, and then watching his fellow American Kris Blanks lip out his bogey putt from just over 5 feet. It was the fourth PGA Tour victory for O’Hair, who started three shots off the lead before shooting 68 to get into the playoff with Blanks (70) at four-under 276.
643 2011-07-25 Mr. Swartz did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. His lawyer would not comment other than to note that Mr. Swartz had pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which “puts everything in it in dispute.”

It should be emphasized, however, that Mr. Swartz was not trying to profit from his activities. He has been a fierce advocate of redistributing information, so much so that in 2008 he promoted a Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto (no longer available online) that said it was imperative to “take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world.”

We are not talking about the latest X-Men movie or Lady Gaga album. Rather it is the research contained in specialized scientific journals with subscriptions that can cost thousands of dollars; institutions can pay tens of thousands of dollars to Jstor. which stands for Journal Storage, for a subscription that bundles these publications online.

That money, Jstor says, is needed to collect and distribute the material and, at times, subsidize institutions that cannot afford it. Founded in 1995, Jstor started with 10 journals available to a few American universities and has since expanded to include about 325,000 journal issues available at more than 7,000 institutions.

His supporters question why the government has reacted so strongly. “This makes no sense,” said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, an organization Mr. Swartz founded to rally support online for an open Internet. “It’s like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.”

The government had its own interpretation of what Mr. Swartz did. “Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars,” the United States attorney for Massachusetts, Carmen M. Ortiz, said last week in a statement about the case. “It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.”

In the government indictment, Mr. Swartz is described as becoming more and more devious in his downloading, signing on with a fake name as a visitor to the M.I.T. campus, and then, when detected, taking more serious steps. At one point, the government says, he tried to get access to the university’s network at a wiring closet, and in an attempt to evade security cameras “held his bicycle helmet like a mask to shield his face, looking through ventilation holes in the helmet.”

It is a tricky situation for Jstor, which got back the hard drives containing its material from Mr. Swartz. It sees itself as having the long-term objective of “continuously adding more content and making it affordably available to more people around the world.”

Asked if it was pleased that someone misusing the service could be brought to justice, a spokeswoman for Jstor wrote in an e-mail response: “We wanted the content back, and we were able to secure it and ensure it wasn’t distributed. We were not interested in further legal action around this incident. We have no comment on the prosecution or how they have chosen to characterize it.”

Courtroom battles over file-sharing — as well as the persistent question of whether copying is “stealing” — are old hat. But the seriousness of the charges, the nature of the material and the motives behind Mr. Swartz’s actions lend the case a political edge for many people who grew up with the Internet.

Demand Progress has highlighted the Swartz case on its Web site, and it says 45,000 people have “signed” its online petition to “stand with Aaron Swartz and his lifetime of work on ethics in government and academics.”

While the group Students for Free Culture, an international organization working to promote free culture ideals, wrote in an e-mail that it had no official position on the Swartz prosecution, the group said it was no surprise that the topic would interest college students.

“One reason that free-culture issues are popular (and not perceived as overly technical or legalistic) is that censorship, copyright abuses, privacy violations, shady network management and other bad behaviors are actually shocking for people who rely on the network for everyday communication,” the group wrote. “They undermine expectations that have built up over years and years of use.”

For Glenn Greenwald, a blogger for Salon and an outspoken critic of the government’s treatment of Bradley E. Manning, the soldier accused of providing secret files later released by WikiLeaks, it also makes sense that a young generation would view the Internet in political terms.

“How information is able to be distributed over the Internet, it is the free speech battle of our times,” he said in interview. “It can seem a technical, legalistic movement if you don’t think about it that way.”

He said that point was illustrated by his experience with WikiLeaks — and by how the Internet became a battleground as the site was attacked by hackers and as large companies tried to isolate WikiLeaks. Looking at that experience and the Swartz case, he said, “clearly the government knows that this is the prime battle, the front line for political control.”

On Twitter, WikiLeaks itself made the link, writing in part, “Keep fighting Mr. Swartz, history is on your side.”

In a comment posted online on Thursday, Gregory Maxwell, 31, a programmer from northern Virginia, wrote that the Swartz case had caused him to rethink his own actions.

He said he had long kept thousands of digital copies of issues from the early years of The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which are available at Jstor, but that he had never shared them.

“I’ve been afraid that if I published them I would be subject to unjust legal harassment by those who profit from controlling access to these works,” he said. Noting the arrest of Mr. Swartz, he wrote, “I now feel that I’ve been making the wrong decision.”

He made the entire file available last week, and did not do it anonymously.

“One reason I put my name on the release, I strongly believe that if any legal action is taken against me, it will be an unjust one,” he wrote, “and I intend to fight it so that other people have less to be afraid of.”
644 2011-07-25 But Beeler, called a “classic super-smart, undersized center” by the draft expert Russ Lande, was not selected in April because he is not as big or athletic as the top prospects at his position. In a normal year, a player like Beeler would have received several calls after the draft, with teams offering modest contracts and camp invitations. By late July, he would have signed with a team, received a playbook and participated in several minicamps or rookie camps. But with contact with free agents forbidden during the lockout, Beeler’s phone went silent after the draft and his career went into a holding pattern.

Beeler finished his college coursework, then embarked on a daily workout regimen with other recent Stanford alumni. They spent seven hours a day lifting weights, cross-training and hitting blocking shields and sleds. Beeler also watched game films, studied his college playbooks and snapped the football hundreds of times a week. The practice buddies became a support group of N.F.L. hopefuls in limbo.

“It was helpful to work out together,” Beeler said. “When one guy was down, the others could pick him up.”

Beeler is one of more than 300 players who, in a typical off-season, would have been signed as rookie free agents. These players are missing training and an N.F.L. indoctrination that they cannot possibly replicate in private workouts.

“If rookie camp hadn’t been there, I wouldn’t be in the N.F.L.,” said Jets safety James Ihedigbo, who made the team as an undrafted free agent in 2007. Ihedigbo used rookie camps to acclimate to the N.F.L. and impress coaches without facing the pressure of veteran competition. The spring camps also serve a basic get-to-know-you function for obscure players whom coaches have never met.

“We had two position coaches in my first camp,” said Ben Muth, who spent the 2008 off-season with the San Diego Chargers. “Only one of them knew my name.”

With no minicamps, no two-a-day practices, and extra-large camp rosters, rookie free agents will get little attention from the coaches. Muth outlined the grim mathematics players like Beeler will face: in a series of four 15-play practice repetitions, a rookie free agent may participate in as few as six plays. With contact strictly controlled during those times, there is little the rookie can do to stand out.

Ihedigbo says rookies must demonstrate their intelligence to survive in any off-season, particularly this year’s truncated one. “The smartest of the smart succeed in this league,” he said.

Beeler has that base covered. He earned a master’s degree in history and speaks Russian well enough “to hail a cab in Moscow or order a tub of borscht.” He learned a complex pro-style offense under Jim Harbaugh, now the coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Once he signs with a team, Beeler says he expects to be “studying every waking moment that I am not in a meeting or on the field.”

Coaches are just as eager to find young talent as the rookies are to demonstrate it, and one assistant, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the lockout, expressed concern that some good players might not get the openings they deserve.

“I like to give young kids their opportunity,” he said. “But where does that kid get his chance now? How do I evaluate him under this format?”

But coaches cannot afford to put mistake-prone players on the field in live competition, especially at Beeler’s position: a blown block or an incorrect line adjustment by a center can end a quarterback’s season.

“If coaches don’t trust you, they won’t play you in the first preseason game,” Muth said. “And if you sit out the first preseason game, you’re cut.”

When not practicing, studying films or keeping up with lockout news, Beeler tries to fill the time he usually spends on school and football. “I saw more movies in the last few months than I probably watched in the previous seven years,” he said. He also blasts zombies in the Call of Duty video game, adding that he’s “not sure if it’s a cathartic release or not.”

Football was once a way for Beeler to relieve stress. It is now a source of stress. “Football has always been an outlet,” he said. “I don’t have that right now.”

Beeler, whose home is in Tulsa, Okla., has been dipping into his savings and borrowing money from his parents while practicing in California.

“That adds extra layers of motivation,” he said. “I am doing this not just for me, but for them.”

When he finally returns to the field, Beeler says he expects a complicated mix of emotions.

“I will be remembering how much I missed it and treasuring the opportunity,” he said. “I always appreciated the game, but this has taken it to another level.”

But Beeler’s return could be short. Ihedigbo offered advice to this year’s class of under-the-gun rookies that could apply to any first-year players.

“Fly to the ball,” he said, “never slow down and never make the same mistake twice.”

When reminded that players may not get a chance to make that second mistake this year, Ihedigbo said: “That’s unfortunate. But it cannot be an excuse.”
645 2011-07-25 What the Chicago Cubs are to baseball, Ireland is to the global economy.

That is one of the central themes in “The Parting Glass,” a one-man show about perpetual underdogs, at the Barrow Street Theater, produced by axis, an arts center in Dublin. For generations the Irish have been promised the possibility of economic and political rebirth only to have their hearts — and wallets — destroyed.

In the Irish novelist Dermot Bolger’s 1990 play “In High Germany” a young Irishman named Eoin tries to break this cycle of disillusionment and reillusionment by leaving the Emerald Isle for the (even) greener pastures of Hamburg. In Mr. Bolger’s new play, a stand-alone sequel, Eoin returns home when the Celtic Tiger finally begins to roar.

Eoin (Ray Yeates) recounts the hard luck of the Irish through the lenses of three alternating autobiographies: his economic life, his love life and the last — and most enchanting of the three — his sporting life.

The Ireland he returns to is shiny and skyscrapered and embarrassingly rich, a land where a credit bubble has led not only to hope but also to hubris. “We’re so successful,” one character says, “we should license the franchise to be Irish.”

Of course that Celtic Tiger soon reveals itself to be a paper tiger, and Eoin and his countrymen lose everything in the financial crisis.
646 2011-07-25 Analysts say few global brands have achieved such a feat in China.

“Apple has done what Google and Facebook cannot do: become No. 1 in China,” said John Quelch, former senior associate dean of Harvard Business School and now head of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “Scarcity sells, and this is the same strategy Apple has used in the U.S.”

Apple’s push into China may be important for other reasons: it shows the depth of this country’s fast-growing upper middle class.

Foreign brands can absorb another lesson as well. Apple’s success shows that with products that are not so easy to counterfeit, Chinese consumers are willing to pay a premium.

The Apple Store, however, is another matter.

Last week, an American blogger living in China posted images of what she believed was a fake Apple Store in the southwestern city of Kunming. The store mimicked the Apple decor, right down to the bright blue T-shirts and white tags Apple employees are required to wear.

“It appears the middle class in China is growing faster than Apple’s presence,” said Charles Wolf, a securities analyst who follows Apple for Needham & Company.

“I mean China has taken rip-offs to a new level, pirating Apple Stores themselves. It speaks to the demand for Apple products throughout China.”

Apple declined to comment on the case. The company has no authorized store in Kunming, only licensed resellers, which are barred from creating look-alike outlets or even calling themselves an Apple Store.

On Friday, China said its own regulators had begun inspecting electronics stores in Kunming to ensure they complied with the law.

Chalk it up to Apple mania, with Chinese characteristics.

Scarcity does seem to be feeding the frenzy. Shortages, bottlenecks and delays have created a thriving gray market in Apple products in China, with many consumers paying hefty prices for iPhones or iPads that have been smuggled in from overseas, ahead of the Chinese release date. Apple said recently its bottlenecks had eased.

Last week, Apple reported blockbuster sales and profits in its third quarter, including $3.8 billion in revenue in greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong.

For the first three quarters of Apple’s fiscal year, revenue in greater China was $8.8 billion — six times that of a year earlier. Last quarter, Apple may have even generated more revenue in China than Lenovo — the Chinese PC maker that seven years ago acquired I.B.M.’s personal computer business, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.

China has become the second-largest market after the United States for apps that run on the smartphone and tablet, according to Distimo, a Dutch company that tracks the popularity of apps. Strong sales of the iPhone and iPad are also helping drive up sales of Apple’s other major products, including desktop computers and laptops.

Apple mania has even inspired grass-roots inventors. A year ago, a 22-year-old programmer and his 25-year-old brother introduced what they called the Apple Peel, essentially a case they said helped turn an iPod into a smartphone capable of making calls.

More recently, a young man released a 19-minute video on Youku, China’s version of YouTube, showing how to make a look-alike iPad from scratch.

This has all helped make Apple seem even cooler. Introductions of new Apple products, though, can be dangerous. Last May, a huge crowd that lined up to get the white model of the iPhone 4 turned unruly and shattered a door at one of Apple’s stores in Beijing.

But how is this going over with the Chinese government, which has been known to create barriers for foreign brands seeking to sell directly to Chinese consumers?

It can easily tie up companies with red tape and regulatory hurdles.

Analysts say Apple has found a sweet spot. The company is operating in the relatively open retail market, where restrictions have been eased. And Apple products do not compete head-to-head with those made by state companies. For instance, there are no major state-owned mobile phone makers.

In fact, Apple has been eager to team up with state-run telecom companies, which control the all-important mobile phone subscriptions. Apple sells its iPhone with service provided by China Unicom, and analysts say the company is now in talks with the country’s other big telecom operators, China Telecom and China Mobile.

What could go wrong for Apple? One of the biggest risks, analysts say, is that Apple moves into social networking or cloud computing, both of which pose a challenge to the Communist Party censors.

The government has blocked Facebook and Twitter and is putting the squeeze on Google, Gmail and the company’s new social networking tool, Google Plus, which is already blocked.
647 2011-07-25 The finance industry’s lead negotiator on debt relief for Greece said that though a deal reached last week would lead to write-offs at some institutions, the move would help assuage fears about the health of European banks.

Many analysts have been skeptical that the agreement reached Thursday by European leaders, which calls for banks to accept a 21 percent cut in the value of their Greek bonds, will bring lasting relief to Greece or ease market tensions.

But Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, whose members include most large global banks, said the accord would help prevent fears about Greece from infecting other countries like Spain and Italy and undermining confidence in banks.

“The uncertainty swirling around this deal was catalyzing negative contagion in two directions,” Mr. Dallara said. “Now there is a sense that the losses are understood and broadly viewed as quite manageable.”

Mr. Dallara, who is based in Washington but spent five weeks in Europe before the deal was announced last week, said by telephone on Sunday that the rescue package would also give Greece a chance to turn around its dysfunctional economy.

659 2011-07-26 Household wealth, also referred to in the report as net worth, is made up of assets, like a house, a car, savings and , minus debts, like , car and credit cards. It is tracked by the Census Bureau in the Survey of Income and Program Participation, a broad sampling of household wealth by race and ethnicity.

Nearly two-thirds of Hispanics’ median net worth in 2005 came from home equity, according to the report, and when the housing market collapsed, so did their wealth. Median home equity for Hispanics fell by 51 percent in the period of the survey. The drop was compounded by the fact that Hispanics tended to live in the places that were hit hardest in the recession, like and , the report said.

Armando Moya, a Mexican immigrant from Woodbridge, outside , experienced these swings of fortune first-hand. For a few happy years, he believed he had avoided his father’s fate of scraping by. He bought a house with a backyard and opened a taco restaurant with his brothers. His bank account was growing, and he took his family on vacations several times a year.

Mr. Moya lives in Prince William County, where the Hispanic population more than tripled from 2000 to 2010, according to the Migration Policy Institute, with many newcomers working in construction trades that were flourishing in the rapidly growing suburbs of Washington.

To capitalize on the influx, Mr. Moya, who is now 38 and had been working in restaurants since he came to the in the early 1990s, decided to start his own, and together with his brother opened Ricos Tacos Moya in 2005.

In the same year, he bought a house valued at $350,000. His monthly payments were more than $2,300, and with hungry workers filling his restaurant, he managed.

But when the collapse of the housing market swept like a wave through this Northern Virginia county, taking his house, and his bank account, and many of his customers along with it, he lost his middle-class lifestyle.

“Everything was going down,” he said.

Now he is back where he started, living with his family in a rented apartment, and working seven days a week in the taco restaurant. His house sold for $135,000 to a couple from , he said.

“My money changed,” he said. “I lost my house.”

The share of Americans with no wealth at all rose sharply during the recession. A third of Hispanics had zero or negative net worth in 2009, up from 23 percent in 2005. For blacks, the portion rose to 35 percent from 29 percent, and for whites, it rose to 15 percent from 11 percent.

About a quarter of all black and Hispanic households owned nothing but a car in 2009. Just 6 percent of whites and 8 percent of Asians were in that situation.

Whites were less affected by the crisis, largely because their wealth flowed from assets other than housing, like stocks. A third of whites owned stocks and in 2005, compared with 8 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of blacks.

The median value of stocks and mutual funds owned by whites dropped by 9 percent from 2005 to 2009. In comparison, the median value of holdings for those blacks who held stocks dropped by 71 percent, most likely because they had to sell when prices were low, Mr. Taylor said.

The median wealth of Hispanic and black households is at its lowest point since 1984, when the Census Bureau first conducted the study, the report said.

Mr. Moya counts himself lucky to still have his restaurant. He has to work weekends at a nightclub in Washington to keep up with his rent. His life is increasingly resembling his father’s — subsisting, without saving — but he has pinned his hopes for a better life on his sons, and he has discarded the idea of returning to .

“I want my house back,” he said. “I’m working for my house right now.”
660 2011-07-26 The Rangers re-signed defenseman Steve Eminger, who had two goals and four assists in 65 games last season. Eminger, 27, who has played for six teams in the N.H.L., was acquired by the Rangers from the Anaheim Ducks for forwards Aaron Voros and Ryan Hillier last July.
661 2011-07-26 Seven states — Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana and Wyoming — do not have effective rate review programs for either individual or small-group health insurance, so federal officials will do the reviews in both markets, the administration said.

In three other states — Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia — the federal government will review proposed rate increases for small groups and will allow states to review individual rates.

James J. Donelon, the Louisiana insurance commissioner, said: “I cannot quarrel with the federal finding. We do not have any authority to regulate health insurance rates under Louisiana law.”

“I am a Republican,” Mr. Donelon added. “I believe in competition as the best way to protect consumers from unreasonable rates. But I have no way of knowing whether they are reasonable or unreasonable because companies have not been required to file rate increases with our department.”

In Montana, a bill to provide the insurance commissioner with power to review health insurance rates died in the Legislature. The commissioner, Monica J. Lindeen, said she would seek such authority again next year because it would be much better for state officials rather than federal officials to judge what was reasonable.

“We have so much more experience, expertise and knowledge about companies and market conditions in Montana,” Ms. Lindeen said.

Federal officials have not publicly explained why they concluded that rate regulation in the 10 states was inadequate.

In a typical letter to one state, Steven B. Larsen, deputy administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, “Iowa does not meet the criteria for an effective rate review program in the small-group market.” He did not cite specific deficiencies.

Susan E. Voss, the Iowa insurance commissioner and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said the Obama administration was evaluating states in an uneven, inconsistent way. Ms. Voss said she had at least as much authority to review rates as officials in other states whose procedures had been found acceptable.

Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, complained that federal officials were stripping states of the freedom to run their health insurance markets.

“In Wyoming, state leaders have chosen to let the free market work,” Mr. Barrasso said, “ The president and his administration have no idea what is best for the people of Wyoming. The people of Wyoming know what works for our state better than any Washington bureaucrat.”

To win federal approval for its rate review program, a state must post information about proposed rate increases on a public Web site.

Bill Deal, director of the Idaho Insurance Department, said he could not meet this requirement because health insurance rate information was considered confidential and proprietary under state law.

Still, Mr. Deal said, “we carefully review rates for individuals and small groups, and it’s difficult for me to understand why we have to have another layer of regulation from the federal government.”

Federal officials will generally follow the definition of “small-group market” found in a state’s insurance laws. If state law does not define it, a small group will be defined to include employers with 50 or fewer employees.

Missouri does not require health insurers to file rate increases with the state, nor does it have authority to approve or disapprove increases.

Melissa L. Fox, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, said, “We do not have rate review authority in the small-group market, with a few exceptions.”

And in Virginia, Kenneth J. Schrad, a spokesman for the State Bureau of Insurance, said the agency did not regulate small-group rates because “we can do only what state law authorizes us to do, and state law does not say anything about rate review in that market.”

The White House pointed to Oregon as a state where consumers benefited from strong rate regulation. Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon sought a 22 percent increase in individual rates, but in a ruling last week the state allowed only 12.8 percent. The company said that was not enough to keep pace with anticipated medical spending for its members.
662 2011-07-26 Bradshaw told a Miami radio station last week that he felt there was a “75-25 chance” he would return to the Giants, but then hinted that he was interested in playing for the Dolphins. Bradshaw will draw attention on the open market after rushing for 1,235 yards and catching 47 passes last year.

The third-string running back D. J. Ware is also a free agent, as is the veteran quarterback Jim Sorgi, who missed all of last season with a shoulder injury.

Brandon Jacobs said in June that he expected to be cut to save $4.65 million in cap space, but Reese brushed off the notion a few days later. Jacobs, who has two years left on his existing contract, may still take a pay cut, though much depends on Bradshaw’s status: if Bradshaw leaves, Jacobs will become the team’s only experienced starter at running back, but if Bradshaw re-signs, the Giants may need Jacobs to renegotiate to free cap space.

The veteran offensive linemen Kareem McKenzie, Shaun O’Hara and Rich Seubert combine to occupy more than $10 million in cap space. McKenzie, the healthiest of the team’s veteran linemen, is probably safe, but O’Hara and Seubert are coming off serious injuries.

Seubert (dislocated kneecap) will probably not be ready for the start of the season. O’Hara had foot and ankle surgery in the offseason but may be the team’s only option at center: the backup center Adam Koets tore an anterior cruciate ligament last year, and Seubert is the team’s third option at the position. O’Hara may be asked to renegotiate his deal.

Defensive end Osi Umenyiora has been adamant in demanding either a new contract or a trade to a team willing to make him one of the league’s highest-paid players at his position. The Giants’ owner John Mara said that the team would not release Umenyiora; it now appears that he will have to settle his differences with Reese: one more thing to squeeze into a tight schedule. The Giants are in a poor position to pursue free agents in the open market, and the team has historically been conservative about signing big-name veterans.

If Bradshaw leaves, the team may pursue a low-cost running back to pair with Jacobs, though the talent pool at running back is thin. Ronnie Brown is the best running back on the market. His speed and receiving ability would make him a fine complement to Jacobs, but he has a long history of knee injuries.

Bills linebacker Paul Posluszny played for the Giants defensive coordinator Perry Fewell in Buffalo, but the Bills are expected to make re-signing Posluszny their top priority.

The Giants must sign eight drafted rookies, including their first-round pick, cornerback Prince Amukamara. They will also sign an undetermined number of rookie free agents to bring their training camp roster close to the 90-player limit. The new rookie wage scale puts strict limits on the lengths and monetary value of contracts, which should speed the signing process.

The Giants have given no indication that they will re-sign the unretired running back Tiki Barber or the free-agent receiver Plaxico Burress, who was released from prison on weapons charges in June. Still, their names are bound to come up often in the days to come.
663 2011-07-26 ALBANY (AP) — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Monday that the state would suspend the operating licenses of eight charter and tour bus companies that repeatedly failed safety inspections.

The Cuomo administration said each company failed three or more roadside inspections of buses or drivers in the last six months. The administration’s order, which for the first time suspends New York companies’ licenses, will sideline about 100 buses within five days.

The companies are Best Trails and Travel Corporation of Brooklyn; Party Ride of Brentwood; A&W Tours of Bellport; Touch of Class and Coach of Wyandanch; Silver Star Limo Company of Yonkers; Zoladz Limousine Service of Depew; Long Island Limousine Service Corporation of Hauppauge; and Big Apple Bus Charter of Brooklyn.

The owner of Long Island Limousine, Perry Stuart, said his buses had clean records.

The owner of Silver Star, Mario Da Rocha, said his buses had passed the last two inspections with no problems.

An official at Party Ride said he did not think the order involved his company.

Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment or could not be contacted.

The stepped-up enforcement followed several fatal bus crashes this year. In March, a crash in the Bronx killed 15 passengers who were returning to Manhattan from an overnight trip to a casino in Connecticut. And last week, two crashes involving buses killed three people.
664 2011-07-26 Every Wednesday, 6,000 pounds of meat arrives at Dickson’s from farms in the Hudson Valley and in Schoharie, near Albany — four steers, and up to nine pigs and seven goats or lambs, are all broken down by hand. Fresh meat lands in the display case and is also turned into charcuterie, while trimmings are churned into ground meat and sausage.

“The dog food is kind of taking it to the next step,” said Mr. Dickson, 31, who demonstrated the “nose to tail” sustainability aspect of Farm to Bowl, his new dog food operation, by spreading out an array of animal parts on brown butcher’s paper. The paper quickly turned pink as it soaked up blood from hearts, tongues and livers. But the meat mélange also included a generous slab of New York strip, which, if it had not been faintly oxidized, Mr. Dickson said, would have sold for up to $34 a pound.

Like other butchers tapping into this niche dog food market, Mr. Dickson said that while offal and other cuts were perfectly safe for humans, he used to throw them away, largely out of cosmetic concerns or because of a surplus. Nowadays, he grinds them up, roasts them and combines them with seasonal produce.

The product is sold fresh in one-and-a-half-pound, $10 packages as dog food. He sells about 100 a week, and according to the company’s Web site, the packages last seven days refrigerated and longer frozen. At one meal per pouch for a medium-size dog, Farm to Bowl is expensive — after all, a 34-pound package of Purina Puppy Chow can be had for $23.

But that has not stopped Ms. Wiseman, who described Mookie and Melanie as “your typical spoiled Manhattan dogs.”

“They’re first — I don’t care,” Ms. Wiseman said, noting that she initially looked into noncommercial dog food after Melanie developed thyroid cancer. Now, Ms. Wiseman visits Dickson’s every other Sunday to stock up. Her dogs’ energy levels are up, she said, and the pets are healthy — and satiated.

Indeed, Mr. Dickson and his business partner, Stacy Alldredge, a canine nutritionist, say their products are a vital investment in a dog’s health.

“If you think about logic, you have a real, live dog here,” said Ms. Alldredge, who also runs Who’s Walking Who, a dog nutrition and obedience-training service. “Of course, real food is going to be better for them. It’s like saying, ‘I’m an athlete, but I’m going to live on Power Bars.’ ”

Jessica Applestone, an owner of Fleisher’s Grass-Fed and Organic Meats in Kingston, N.Y., which has also gotten into the dog food business, has a similar opinion of processed dog food.

“If you’re not feeding your dog human-quality food it’s a terrifying thing,” said Ms. Applestone, 44, who began producing dog food at Fleisher’s shortly after the company opened seven years ago. “It’s very true that there’s much more of a movement, and we’re very happy to see it. People see that pushing a better diet for their dogs results in less vet visits.”

The company produces $4 packages with four ready-to-eat two-ounce patties made of organic chicken and beef hearts, liver and tongue, and sprinkled with beef fat. Fleisher’s sells about 100 pounds of patties a week.

In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, T. J. Burnham, the head butcher at Marlow & Daughters, has for four months sold $6 pints of his house dog-food blend: raw lean beef and beef liver, combined with cooked chicken, carrots, celery and barley, splashed with cider vinegar to aid in digestion. The shop stocks 20 to 50 pounds at a time.

Still, whether it is raw, pan seared, flambéed or otherwise elaborately prepared, not all dog owners are believers in foodie-grade puppy chow.

On a recent weekday afternoon, Linda Mascia and Janet Gritzka, both 64 and from Huntington in Suffolk County, admired the meats in the display case at Dickson’s Farmstand in the Chelsea Market.

The women inquired about the beef labeled picanha (a premium Brazilian-style cut) and laughed when asked if they would consider Farm to Bowl dog food for their dogs.

“No,” Ms. Mascia insisted, breaking into a grin. “I just stick with what the vet tells me — Iams!”

For her part, Ms. Gritzka seemed to go into sticker shock when told the price.

She stole one last glance at Dickson’s ruby red marbled meats and said, “That’s one very spoiled puppy.”
665 2011-07-26 Travelers can take several steps to protect themselves, said Marybeth Bond, a women’s travel expert in San Francisco who runs www.gutsytraveler.com and has written several National Geographic women’s travel books. Women need to “trust their instincts,” she said, if a situation seems awry. When hotel employees make deliveries, she said, travelers should either leave the door fully open or say, “I’ll take it from here — you don’t need to come into the room.” Ms. Bond carries a rubber doorstopper to jam under her hotel door and says she makes sure any adjoining hotel room doors are locked.

Ms. Bond also said hotel bars could be problematic. “Men are always hanging out there looking for something,” she said. “I love the hotels where I can order a glass of wine and have it brought up to the room. Ask for a woman to bring it.” In this way, she said, “You set the tone, and then they know you are taking control of the situation.”

Hotel bars can be relaxed settings for meeting other business travelers. But Ms. Bond said women should be aware that date rape drugs could be placed into a drink; she recommended coasters from Drink Safe Technologies, which detect some of these drugs.

She added that if consensual sex occurs, “When someone is in your room, lock up your stuff.”

Trouble often starts when a traveler allows someone in a hotel room, said Joe A. McInerney, chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, an industry group. “Very few things that happen in a guest room would have happened if the guest did not let the person in,” he said.

Hotel lobbies have also become popular gathering spots, and that, too, can spell trouble. “The lobby is becoming a place for young people to be social,” Mr. McInerney said. “We used to call them ‘lobby lizards’ in the 1920s — people just hanging out in hotel lobbies. Now, it’s back with social networking.” That, he said, “is how they do things,” he added, “and that can be a problem.”

Mr. McInerney noted a couple of other highly publicized sex cases involving hotels. One was the rape of the singer Connie Francis in 1974. Her lawsuit against the hotel led to industrywide security changes. Another he cited was the 1992 rape of Desiree Washington, a contestant in the Miss Black America pageant in Indianapolis, by the boxer Mike Tyson. After that incident, Mr. McInerney said, the hotel association began posting guidelines, available on its Web site, to help prevent assaults.

Men can be victims, too. A well-publicized case was the murder in January of the Portuguese journalist Carlos Castro in New York. His companion, Renato Seabra, a male model, was charged.

“On a crime of passion, there is really nothing you can do,” Mr. McInerney said, but there is a need to “educate people that you do the same things” for both sexes regarding safety.

While business travelers may worry about strangers, Stephen Barth, the founder of hospitalitylawyer.com and a professor of hotel law at the University of Houston, said co-workers present risks, too. “People are normal until they check into a hotel room,” he said, adding, “The entire duty of care that companies have for their employees, such as harassment policies, still apply when traveling with another employee.”

Mr. Barth said it was once common practice to give out the hotel room numbers of guests when outsiders called. This method was used in 2009 by a stalker, Michael David Barrett, to locate the room where an ESPN sportscaster, Erin Andrews, was staying. He secretly videotaped her through a hotel door peephole.

While hotels generally no longer give out room numbers, Mr. Barth said the same information still could be found on room service door tags and gym sign-in sheets.

Most incidents in hotels are not widely reported, said Ms. Bond, the women’s travel expert.

Ms. Duwe, the 2002 hotel attack victim, who now runs her own public relations company in Idaho, is a case in point. “I don’t think the attack hit the news because it wasn’t severe enough,” she said. She said she later took kick-boxing classes to protect herself. Still, she said, “When you’re in the business center and someone cuts the light out and hits you from behind and you’re in flip-flops, it’s just an all-around bad situation.”
666 2011-07-26 The price change “doesn’t take effect until the very end of the third quarter,” the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, said in an interview Monday. “So we have to face those subscribers who are upset by the increase this quarter.” While he said he expected only “a few” to cancel or downgrade service, “that means less revenue than we otherwise would have had.”

The price change will benefit Netflix in the fourth quarter and beyond, he said, expressing no misgivings about the change in strategy. He said that Netflix intended to spend the increased revenue on its online streaming service, keeping its domestic operating margin for the year around its target of 14 percent. In the second quarter, its domestic margin was 16.3 percent.

“As our subscriber base continues to grow, we’re able to spend more on improving that service, both on the R.& D. side and on the content availability side,” Mr. Hastings said, using shorthand for research and development.

Keeping online streaming customers satisfied is a critical task for Netflix, which is vulnerable to the licensing decisions of Hollywood studios. Netflix has indicated that it is confident that it can pay what is necessary to license enough content from studios.

Mr. Hastings declined to comment on a Bloomberg News report that it was in talks to license the exclusive streaming rights to DreamWorks Animation films, replacing DreamWorks’ pact with HBO. An executive with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no announcement had been made, said that HBO had offered DreamWorks an early departure from its contract with the premium cable company.

Netflix said that it remained in talks with its single biggest supplier of films, Starz. That agreement comes up for renewal in the first quarter of 2012.
667 2011-07-26 The practice is common enough that recently passed a law outlawing job ads that bar unemployed workers from applying. New York and Michigan are considering the idea, and similar legislation has been introduced in Congress. The National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit organization that studies the labor market and helps the unemployed apply for benefits, has been reviewing the issue, and last week issued a report that has nudged more politicians to condemn these ads.

Given that the average duration of unemployment today is nine months — a record high — limiting a search to the “recently employed,” much less the currently employed, disqualifies millions.

The positions advertised with preferences for the already-employed run the gamut. Some are for small businesses, and others for giants, including the commercial University of Phoenix (which, like some other companies, removed the ads after an inquiry by ) or the fast-food chain Pollo Tropical. They cover jobs at all skill levels, including hotel concierges, restaurant managers, teachers, I.T. specialists, business analysts, sales directors, account executives, orthopedics device salesmen, auditors and air-conditioning technicians.

“It is really a buyer’s market for employers right now,” said Harry J. Holzer, an economist at and the Urban Institute. One consequence is that the long-term unemployed will rack up even more weeks of unemployment, Mr. Holzer said, and will find it harder to make the transition back to work.

Even if Congress passed a measure forbidding companies from making current employment a requirement for job applicants, companies could still simply decide not to hire people who are out of work. Discrimination would be difficult to prove.

After all, there are legitimate reasons that many long-term unemployed workers may not be desirable job candidates. In some cases they may have been let go early in the recession, not just because business had slowed, but because they were incompetent.

Idle workers’ skills may atrophy, particularly in dynamic industries like technology. They may lose touch with their network of contacts, which is important for people in sales. Beaten down by months of rejection and idleness, they may not interview well or easily return to a 9-to-5 schedule.

“We may be seeing what’s called statistical discrimination,” said Robert Shimer, a labor economist at the . “On average, these workers might be less attractive, and employers don’t bother to look more closely to pick out the good ones.”

Employers receive so many applications for each opening that some may use current employment status as an easy filter. In some cases — as with Ms. Wiedemer, of Westminster, Colo. — recruiters merely assume employers do not want jobless workers.

“Clients don’t always tell us ‘we don’t want to see résumés from unemployed workers,’ but we can sense from what people have interested them in the past that they’re probably looking for somebody who’s gainfully employed, who’s closer to the action,” said Dennis Pradarelli, a talent acquisition manager for Marbl, a recruiting firm in Brookfield, Wis. Many of the job ads posted by his firm seek workers who are “currently employed or only recently unemployed.”

Many firms that are not intentionally screening out the unemployed may still disqualify such applicants for having bad credit histories after having fallen behind on the bills — which they of course need a job to pay.

It’s not clear what can be done to pull workers out of this unemployment trap.

Government incentives for companies to hire unemployed workers have met with limited success. One such tax incentive from last year was poorly publicized, so most employers did not know about it. Better publicity may not suffice, either. An experiment from the 1980s found that telling companies that the unemployed were eligible for generous wage subsidies actually made employers less likely to hire such workers.

Job counselors often encourage the long-term unemployed to go back to school or volunteer to demonstrate that they are still productive, engaged members of society. But absent the actual acquisition of marketable skills — which many retraining programs do not provide — it’s not clear such efforts improve the chances of being hired.

“Mentally, it may be good for the candidate, but I think companies are still in a position to say ‘O.K., we’re looking for a candidate with the most up-to-date skills,’ ” Mr. Pradarelli said. “If you’ve been out of pocket for two years, going back to school sounds nice, but it doesn’t make or break the situation.”

The best solution, economists say, would be to encourage job growth more broadly, which may initially involve poaching people from other companies but could eventually draw even the least desirable workers back into jobs. During the boom years of the late ’90s, the labor market was so tight that ex-convicts had relatively little trouble finding work.

In the meantime, people like Ms. Wiedemer — who has been out of work for three years — are exhausting their benefits and piecing together what support they can from food stamps and family members. And they are stuck hoping that economic growth manages to outpace their own descent into permanent economic exile.

“I worry that unemployment may eventually come down, not because older workers who have been unemployed for a year or two find jobs,” Professor Shimer said, “but because older workers finally give up and drop out of the labor force.”
668 2011-07-26 AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Contract talks between Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers began Monday with promises by both sides to reach an agreement that benefits workers, the company and the American taxpayers who bailed out the nation’s third-largest automaker.

The opening of negotiations at Chrysler will be followed this week by similar ceremonies at General Motors and Ford. The current four-year agreements between Detroit’s Big Three and the U.A.W. expire in mid-September.

After years of losses and restructuring culminating in a government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009, Chrysler hopes to continue rebuilding its operations under its new owner, the Italian automaker Fiat.

Company executives said the next contract with the union could not add costs that make the company uncompetitive with foreign automakers. Four years ago, Chrysler estimated that each union worker cost $76 an hour in wages and benefits. After substantial job cuts that have reduced the company’s hourly employees in the United States to 23,000, Chrysler’s typical U.A.W. worker now costs $49 an hour.

“We have a responsibility to ensure we don’t go back to our old formula,” said Al Iacobelli, Chrysler’s vice president of employee relations. “Unfortunately, we have a rich history of not getting it right.”
669 2011-07-26 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Australia and Malaysia signed a refugee-swapping agreement on Monday that aims to stem the flow of asylum seekers to Australia’s shores. Although the plan promises that the migrants Australia will send to Malaysia will have more rights than the migrants already here, it has failed to satisfy refugee advocates, who accuse Australia of abandoning its international obligations.

Under the arrangement, 800 migrants who have arrived illegally in Australia by boat will be sent to Malaysia, where their refugee claims will be processed by the United Nations. In return, Australia will accept 4,000 United Nations-certified refugees from Malaysia over the next four years.

The people Australia sends to Malaysia will enjoy rights denied to the more than 94,000 registered asylum seekers and refugees now here. For example, they will be able to work and have access to education and health care.

Rights advocates, however, say that Australia risks violating its obligations under the United Nations refugee convention because Malaysia is not a party to the convention and has a poor record in its treatment of refugees, with many of them living in cramped conditions for years awaiting resettlement in another country.

Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, said all asylum seekers should be allowed to work and have access to education and medical care. “Australia is using Malaysia as a dumping ground for boat people it does not want, and in the process walking away from its commitments to follow the 1951 Refugees Convention,” Mr. Robertson said.
670 2011-07-26 Mrs. Clinton called for regional economic integration to be pursued through groups that include the United States like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, whose annual gathering is to be led by President Obama in Hawaii this year.

Li Kui-wai, the director of the APEC Studies Center at the City University of Hong Kong, pointed out that American support for multilateralism in Asia came after many years of American bilateral deals with Asian nations. These include the United States’s free trade agreement with South Korea now awaiting Congressional approval, which Mrs. Clinton also discussed.

But President Obama’s chairmanship of APEC this year does give the United States a chance to embrace a more multilateral approach in Asia, Dr. Li said.

Mrs. Clinton spoke here after spending the weekend at a security conference in Bali, Indonesia. At that conference, she and other American diplomats continued to support a collective Southeast Asian response to China’s assertions of sovereignty over most of the South China Sea.

Chinese diplomats have sought bilateral discussions on maritime sovereignty in the region and have strongly objected to having the United States play a role. This year’s security conference was less contentious than last year’s, however, as the foreign ministers of China and Southeast Asian nations agreed last Wednesday on guidelines for further talks.

Mrs. Clinton’s visits to Hong Kong and Indonesia followed stops in Greece, Turkey and India, where she also pressed for a continuing American role on issues like Greece’s debt troubles, for which the European Union has clearly led the international response.

After her speech in Hong Kong, Mrs. Clinton traveled by car across the border to Shenzhen in mainland China to meet with Dai Bingguo, a state councilor with broad authority over foreign policy, after which she was scheduled to fly back overnight to the United States.

Departing briefly from the Asian economy themes of her speech, Mrs. Clinton also offered an assurance that Congress and the Obama administration would find a way to raise the ceiling on the national debt.

“The political wrangling in Washington is intense right now, but these kinds of debates have been a constant in our political life throughout the history of our republic,” she said, later adding that she was “confident that Congress will do the right thing and secure a deal on the debt ceiling, and work with President Obama to take the steps necessary to improve our long-term fiscal outlook.”

Chinese officials have been warily watching the debt debate in the United States. With more than $1 trillion in Treasury bonds, China holds roughly a tenth of the American national debt.

China’s precise holdings are unclear, as monthly data for foreign holdings of Treasury bonds are highly unreliable because the notes are frequently held in the names of various banks in other countries, while the most recent annual data is from last summer and is not fully comprehensive either.

Mrs. Clinton also spoke in Hong Kong to a gathering of the local branches of the American Chamber of Commerce and the Asia Society.

She praised Hong Kong’s commitment to free markets and light regulation. She conspicuously avoided any mention of the democratic aspirations of Hong Kong residents or their concerns about one of the world’s highest levels of economic inequality, which some local critics have attributed to limited regulation of oligopolies and real estate deals between large companies and the government.

A march here on July 1 by protesters calling for more democracy and more populist economic policies drew 54,000 people, according to the final police estimate, and 218,000 people, according to the organizers. Mrs. Clinton offered unalloyed praise for Hong Kong’s strengths, and put them in the context of the system of one country with two economic and legal systems that China and Britain created when Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997.

China has objected strongly over the years to any American advice on how to run Hong Kong, contending that it amounts to foreign interference in China’s domestic affairs.

“Under the ‘one country, two systems’ policy, this remains a city that bridges East and West and looks outward in all directions, a place where ideas become businesses, where companies compete on the merits, and where economic opportunity is palpable and real for millions of people, a place that defines the fierce and productive economic competition of our time,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Albert Ho, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong, said that he was “a little bit disappointed” that Mrs. Clinton did not mention democracy in Hong Kong during her speech, especially as she spoke right after she had met privately with four local lawmakers: Mr. Ho and Audrey Eu, the leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, as well as two senior politicians from pro-Beijing parties.

Democracy in Hong Kong is important, Mr. Ho said in a telephone interview, because “it’s symbolic for possible change in China.”
671 2011-07-26 Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s credit rating Monday after concluding that the euro zone bailout plan announced last week would require private sector holders of Greek debt to take credit losses.

The agency said it downgraded Greece’s debt ratings from Caa1, already deep in junk-bond territory, to Ca — one step above default — “to reflect the expected loss implied by the proposed debt exchanges.” It said it would reassess that rating once the deal had been completed.

Moody’s offered a generally positive assessment of the plan agreed to by European leaders on Thursday, saying it “benefits all euro area sovereigns by containing the contagion risk that would likely have followed a disorderly payment default on existing Greek debt.”

But the ratings agency expressed concern about “the negative precedent set by the endorsement of distressed exchanges” between Greece and its creditors, a reference to the bond swaps that private investors will undertake.

Those holding Greek debt are “virtually certain” to suffer losses, it said.

The restructuring element was an essential component of the deal because Germany and several other countries had insisted that no new rescue for Greece was possible without banks bearing part of the pain. Fitch Ratings said Friday that doing so would constitute a restricted default.

“While the rating agency believes that the overall package carries a number of benefits for Greece — a slightly reduced debt trajectory, lower debt-servicing costs, as well as reduced reliance on financial markets for years to come — the impact on Greece’s debt burden is limited,” Moody’s added.

After the news, the yield on the Greek 10-year bond rose 9 basis points, to 13.82 percent.

Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have also rated Greece as junk, or noninvestment grade.

684 2011-07-27 “I think they’re very pleased with the antigovernment inclinations of the Tea Party Republicans when it comes to taxes and regulation,” said David Axelrod, one of the president’s chief political advisers. “But now we have a situation where the integrity of the economy and the U.S. financial system is at stake, and they’re being hoisted on their own petards.”

The chamber and its allies say that they remain confident that Congress will act to raise the debt ceiling, and moreover that they have supported the demands of House Republicans that the government should be allowed to borrow more only if it starts spending less.

“There’s nothing more important for financial stability than getting the debt ceiling raised and putting our nation on a prudent financial path, a message we have been delivering to lawmakers for weeks,” said Rob Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum, which has joined with the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers to press the issue.

The manufacturers’ association joined the chamber on Tuesday in endorsing the Boehner plan, which the White House has described as unacceptable because it allows only enough borrowing room to pay the government’s bills until early next year, when a new agreement would be required.

The chamber made a big splash during the midterm elections with advertisements that attacked Democratic incumbents, particularly those who supported the president’s health care legislation, for being antibusiness. It issued endorsements describing their Republican opponents as “invaluable” leaders on business issues who would support economic growth.

Among the beneficiaries was Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican. The chamber spent $250,000 on ads blasting the Democratic incumbent, Representative Alan Grayson. Mr. Webster won.

In July, Mr. Webster introduced legislation instructing the Treasury to prioritize interest payments, then military spending, then Social Security checks, then Medicare payments, “in the event the debt ceiling is reached.” Experts regard the idea as unworkable.

The chamber spent $436,953 helping to elect Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, almost 20 percent of the total that he was able to raise and spend on his own.

This month, Mr. Pearce told the radio program “News New Mexico” that cutting federal spending was just as important as increasing the debt ceiling.

“We have talked a lot about Armageddon if we don’t pass the debt ceiling,” he said. “There’s an equal Armageddon on the other side if we don’t start curing the spending problems.”

In May, the chamber gave $2,000 to Representative Patrick Meehan, a Pennsylvania Republican already building up a war chest for the 2012 campaign.

A few weeks later, Mr. Meehan said he was “hopeful that we will reach an agreement that stops our massive borrowing and reckless spending without risking a default."

It has been clear since last fall that the government would hit the debt ceiling, the legal maximum that it can borrow, at some point during 2011. In May, the Treasury said that it had reached the legal limit and that it would begin to cancel obligations to other parts of the government, allowing it to borrow enough money to pay all of the government’s bills until early August.

The president asked Congress to increase the limit. House Republicans refused unanimously, insisting that Democrats first agree to cut spending by the same amount.

Business groups stayed mostly on the sidelines for months. The chamber orchestrated a May letter from business groups to political leaders calling for an agreement. In July, the groups sent a second letter, this time signed by several hundred chief executives. It was nothing in comparison with the efforts the same groups have made in recent years to oppose legislation on health care and financial regulation, or their recent advocacy in support of free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.

One reason for the relative silence was the assumption that the ceiling would be raised. Even now, there is widespread confidence that the parties will strike a deal — a state of affairs most clearly reflected in the ease with which the government continues to borrow money from investors.

“Also you don’t want to be on the wrong side,” said Tom Block, the longtime head of government relations for JPMorgan Chase and now a private consultant. “They had the confidence that this is going to be resolved without their participation, so why participate?”

Another difference has been the absence of a piece of legislation to hail or hammer.

Mr. Axelrod said business groups were constrained by their desire to win the support of House freshmen on other issues, including the trade agreements and efforts to roll back regulation.

“I just think that there was, at least on the part of the chamber, a reluctance to tangle with, or pressure, the same group in the House that they’re depending on to gut financial reform and undo environmental regulation and so on,” he said. “But I think the gravity of the situation is now clear.”

Business groups disputed that characterization, but agreed with the conclusion.

“We’ve worked with the broader business community over the last month,” said Aric Newhouse, senior vice president for government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. “It’s the right thing to do to provide certainty for the country and the economy.”

J. P. Fielder, a spokesman for the chamber, said the group was encouraging members to address the debt ceiling so they could return to other issues.
685 2011-07-27 If the risk-free status quo gets upended, the complexities of remodeling would be considerable. At first, investors and other market participants might simply treat AA American bonds the same way they do ones currently rated AAA. But that philosophy wouldn’t necessarily hold, especially if the country’s credit further weakened.

Banks and hedge funds could require greater amounts of capital. Widely used strategies to exploit gaps between short-term and long-term rates would be less profitable. Bigger spreads in option markets might appear as investors adjusted for the differential between borrowing and lending costs. There would be many more unintended, and potentially painful, consequences. But exposing “risk-free” for the illusion that it is would nevertheless correct another major flaw.

For all its promise, Brazil’s oil bounty has so far disappointed investors. Petrobras, the state-controlled giant, has trailed rivals by a wide margin since the Brazilian government forced it to pay through the nose for offshore oil reserves nearly a year ago. Now the company is trying to make amends by trimming unpopular refining spending and lifting output goals. The pledges deserve skepticism.

It has been a grim 10 months since Petrobras raised $70 billion in the biggest share offering ever. Its 15 percent stock price decline has been particularly abysmal considering the 50 percent surge in the price of Brent crude. This has propelled shares of peers like Exxon Mobil by about 40 percent.

Petrobras’s punishment is understandable. In its September 2010 offering, the government grossly overcharged for new oil wells, transferring billions of dollars of value away from shareholders. It also promised $74 billion of capital investment in refining over five years, which seemed aimed at creating jobs rather than generating returns.

The latest five-year plan at least suggests Petrobras is not entirely deaf to such concerns. Extracting Brazil’s vast deep-sea trove will be allotted a higher percentage of the $225 billion capital spending budget. Refining will get $3 billion less over five years.

Petrobras also appears to be disavowing any plans to issue new shares — no small mercy after increasing the tally about 50 percent last year. And in an uncharacteristic nod to fiscal responsibility, the company is also talking about $13.5 billion in asset sales.

Still, these look like baby steps considering Petrobras’s dismal valuation. It’s trading at just 55 percent of net asset value, as estimated by IHS, an energy consultancy, down from about 80 percent before its offering and compared with 70 percent for Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

Petrobras’s credibility is further dented by stretching its 2020 production goals to 6.4 million barrels of oil a day from the 5.4 million barrels many analysts already considered overambitious. Investors have been burned once by Petrobras. Until the company actually delivers on some of its promises, a discount is warranted.
686 2011-07-27 Those concerns erupted after guns linked to Fast and Furious straw buyers were found at the scene where a Border Patrol agent was killed in December 2010.

“You had the same people buying weapons repeatedly, leading to the same cartel, and you didn’t quit because you hadn’t made your case and so continued selling until had you had a dead federal agent and a scandal,” Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican who is chairman of the committee, told Mr. Newell.

The current and former A.T.F. agents based in Mexico on Tuesday also sharply criticized the operation and said they had been kept in the dark about its tactics, which they said ran counter to the bureau’s traditional training and procedures.

While members of both parties criticized the tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious, a partisan divide opened over the direction of the Congressional investigation into it. Republicans sought to tie the operation to Obama administration political appointees, but Democrats released excerpts from staff interviews of officials who said that there had been no briefings of high-level A.T.F. or Justice Department officials about the tactics used in the Phoenix operation.

Previous reports and letters released by Mr. Issa and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have quoted other excerpts from the interviews of those officials — including the acting director of the firearms bureau, Kenneth Melson — but made no mention of the sections that undermined the notion that top Justice Department officials sanctioned or knew about the tactics.

“The committee’s report promotes unsubstantiated theories by selectively releasing excerpts of transcripts while ignoring testimony and other information,” said Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, noting that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had ordered an inspector general investigation into the operation.

Mr. Issa did not address Democratic accusations that his reports have been misleadingly selective, but he and other Republicans sparred extensively with Democrats about another dispute: whether their close look at gun trafficking along the Southwest border had demonstrated a need for tighter gun control laws and greater support for the bureau despite opposition by gun rights lobbyists.

“Congress’s hands are hardly clean on this subject,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia.

Noting that the Senate had refused to confirm a permanent director for the bureau for more than six years, Mr. Connolly added: “We have done everything in our power in Congress to try to defang the A.T.F. to make sure that it’s toothless. We’ve done everything we can to fight your budget and reduce it so that you don’t have the resources to do the job.”

The hearing ended with a tart exchange between Mr. Issa and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia, whom Mr. Issa accused of being “radically against the Second Amendment.”

Ms. Norton brought up a bill that would create a federal statute against illegal firearms trafficking; proponents say such a statute would give A.T.F. agents more leverage to persuade straw buyers to take the risk of providing information about higher-level criminals. She asked Mr. Issa if he would co-sponsor the legislation.
687 2011-07-27 President Benjamin Jealous of the N.A.A.C.P. urged Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, to remove the Confederate battle flag that flies near her office. Protests by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People led in 2000 to the flag’s being moved from the Statehouse dome and from House and Senate chambers to a monument outside the Statehouse. But Mr. Jealous said at the group’s convention in Los Angeles that “one of the most perplexing examples of the contradictions of this moment in history is that Nikki Haley, South Carolina’s first governor of color, continues to fly the Confederate Flag.” Ms. Haley’s parents came from India. Her spokesman said Tuesday she had no plans to revisit the issue.
688 2011-07-27 WASHINGTON — Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, President Obama’s nominee to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned on Tuesday that proposed cuts in the military budget of up to $1 trillion would be “extraordinarily difficult and very high risk.”

General Dempsey, who is currently the Army chief of staff, made his comments at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee for the Joint Chiefs chairmanship. Mr. Obama has already ordered the Pentagon to come up with $400 billion in cuts over the next 12 years, but other deficit-reduction proposals under debate in the battle over the nation’s borrowing would cut far more.

A plan released by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, estimates $1 trillion in military savings by “winding down” the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as does a similar proposal that grew out of bipartisan talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier this summer. Another proposal by the so-called Gang of Six, a bipartisan group of senators in search of a solution to the growing deficit, would cut nearly $890 billion from security spending over the next decade, including from the military.

It is unclear whether any of the proposals will survive the current confusion on Capitol Hill.

General Dempsey, who is expected to be easily confirmed, tangled briefly at the hearing with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who demanded to know what $800 billion to $1 trillion in military cuts would do to the readiness of the armed services over the next decade. General Dempsey replied that Mr. Obama had asked the Pentagon to cut only $400 billion, but “based on the difficulty of achieving the $400 billion cut, I believe 800 would be extraordinarily difficult and very high risk.”

General Dempsey also said that protecting the United States from computer cyberattacks would “probably be one of a handful of issues that define my tenure as chairman.”

690 2011-07-27 The exhibition was of particular importance, Ms. Chiu said, because Asia Society views its role as reaching beyond the display of art to encourage a broader understanding of Asian cultures. Moreover the sculpture, architectural reliefs and works of gold and bronze in the show, which were produced from the third century B.C. to the fifth century A.D., are poorly represented in American museums. The last exhibition devoted to Gandhara art in the United States was at Asia Society in 1960.

The first sign of trouble appeared in January, a little more than a month before the scheduled March opening, when it became clear that federal authorities in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, had not informed the museums in Lahore and Karachi, where the Buddhist objects were kept, of the plan to fly them to New York, Ms. Chiu said.

Officials at the Culture Ministry were reluctant to allow the Gandhara treasures out of the country, least of all to the United States. They were particularly opposed because there had been recent exhibitions of Gandhara art in Bonn, Zurich and Paris, she said, and they did not want the objects to be outside Pakistan for another extended period so soon.

An added complication arose when a new law handed the power to make decisions on art loans to foreign countries from the central ministry to the provinces where the museums were located.

On a hurried mission to Lahore, in Punjab Province, in January, Ms. Chiu knew she needed to persuade the chief minister of the province, Shahbaz Sharif, who is not an easy figure to see on short notice. Just weeks earlier her longtime local ally in organizing the show, the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, had been killed by an extremist bodyguard. And while she was there, a C.I.A. operative, Raymond A. Davis, shot two Pakistanis on a Lahore thoroughfare, stoking anti-American sentiment in the city and across Pakistan.

With some fast networking among the Lahore elite, Ms. Chiu found a new ally in a patron of the arts, Nusrat Jamil, who opened doors to Mr. Sharif. “The meeting was confirmed at 1:30 a.m., and I saw him at his house at 9 a.m.,” Ms. Chiu said.

Mr. Sharif was supportive but said the decision was up to the board of the Lahore Museum, Ms. Chiu said. She then arranged to lobby all 10 members. They voted in favor, a victory that ensured the arrival of the star piece of the show, an intricately carved stele called “Vision of a Buddha Paradise.”

On a second visit to Pakistan in April to firm up a late-spring opening, Ms. Chiu discovered that date would have to be postponed as well. The authorities in Karachi had yet to sign the papers to release 17 objects from the National Museum of Pakistan there. As she waited for Karachi to sign off, the killing of Bin Laden on May 2 escalated the anti-American feelings in Pakistan even further, and added to the nervousness at Asia Society about whether the show would ever come to pass.

Then trouble loomed on the home front. A State Department travel advisory warning American citizens against traveling to Pakistan meant that Asia Society could not send some of its staff members to accompany the works on the flights back to New York, a typical procedure for bringing art from abroad to the museum. (Ms. Chiu could travel to Pakistan because she has an Australian passport.) Visas for the Pakistanis flying with the art were held up at the American Embassy in Islamabad, a bottleneck that was resolved in the office of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ms. Chiu said.

The packing and loading of the objects in Karachi was not simple, either. A chaotic city saddled with prolonged power shortages, Karachi had been in the midst of a spasm of ethnic killings when the German company hired by Asia Society to crate the objects began work early this month.

Members of the museum staff, too scared to use public transportation, had to be taken in hired cars from their homes to the museum to help wrap and load. A generator at the museum supplied power for lights for the packers, and the Germans used their own satellite phones to report their progress to Ms. Chiu in New York, she said.

The early August opening of the show was guaranteed only when two planes loaded with the precious cargo, one from Lahore, the other from Karachi, landed in New York last week. The chances that Americans can go to Pakistan to see Gandhara art — either in the museums or at open-air archaeological sites around Peshawarc, the northwest city where the civilization was centered — are very slim, Ms. Chiu said, making her feel all the luckier to have gotten the works here for the show’s three-month run.
691 2011-07-27 The play takes place in the comfortable living room of the middle-class Harrington family. Mr. Greenspan sets the scene himself, transforming the mundane stage directions (“Left, just below the stairs, is a small stand and a telephone ...”) into an involving little prologue, conjuring an imaginary set in precise detail. (The actual set, by Dane Laffrey, corresponds to Mr. Greenspan’s colorful description in only a few details.)

All is not well in the Harrington home. Mrs. Harrington, the kind of scattered, social-climbing housewife you can easily imagine being played by Billie Burke, is exulting in the forthcoming marriage of her daughter Grace to one of the town’s most eligible and well-to-do young men, Billy Caldwell. Her maternal pride is tempered by shame at the family’s current lack of an automobile.

“I’ve got to ride in the streetcar like a common washerwoman,” she moans.

The gruff but jolly Mr. Harrington, who’s in grocery sales, remains unmoved, bluffly telling his wife she’s not going to be tooling around town in a new car anytime soon.

“You’ve got just as much chance of me buying another automobile as you have of seeing a Swiss battleship sinking off the coast of Nebraska,” he cracks in a line that smacks delectably of 1920s stage humor.

The daughters of the house are at simmering loggerheads too. The snobbish Grace lords it over her older sister with an impunity indulged by her mother, while the wholesome, put-upon Patricia is left to pine for Tony Anderson, the psychology-obsessed boy Grace tossed aside when a more enticing prospect came along.

But the plot is not the point. As it scoots along in predictable channels, with a few quirky detours — the self-improving Patricia is obsessed with turning herself into a master of witty repartee through a mail-order catalog — the real show is in Mr. Greenspan’s nimble scrambling among characters. Although he uses no props or costumes, it’s almost always crystal clear who’s talking or fuming or fighting.

It helps, of course, that this comedy is peopled by simply drawn types: the shy hero, the plucky heroine, the doting father. Mr. Greenspan has particular fun with the bad egg Grace and her cool viciousness, which extends to persecuting an impertinent telephone operator in one of the play’s odder byways. Mrs. Harrington’s hyperactive anxiety about the family’s social position occasions feverish bouts of hysteria, as her high-pitched whinnying crescendos into a shrill screech.

The jovially clueless Billy and the sweetly sincere Tony are cleanly contrasted, and Mr. Greenspan’s portrayal of the good-natured Patricia, who tearfully plans to sacrifice the man she loves because she believes he still loves her sister, is infused with a tremulous sincerity that is funny and affectionate. Naturally, the climactic scene in which Tony and Patricia first share a kiss makes for a goofy highlight, as Mr. Greenspan gives and receives the kiss as both the swooning Patricia and the awkward but tender Tony.

If Mr. Greenspan’s performance in “The Patsy” illustrates the actor as dexterous acrobat, “Jonas” reveals the actor as imaginative artist. Mr. Greenspan played the role of a servant in the Manhattan Theater Club’s recent revival of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber’s “Royal Family,” and in this half-hour monologue he explores how even small roles can provide potent inspiration for the inquisitive, inward-looking performer.

Called simply Jo in the text, the character is about 50. Mr. Greenspan, who has invented the fuller name Jonas, imagines his life as a gay man both before and after his service to the acting clan in the play. This fanciful history of a fictional character is intertwined with Mr. Greenspan’s own reflections on playing the role, as well as with the life of yet another fictional character dreamed up by the servant himself.

“There are then the three of us, each inventing what I describe,” Mr. Greenspan says. “There is myself, the character I once played, and the man he invents who invents what I describe.”

Confused? Not for nothing is Mr. Greenspan a Gertrude Stein admirer. He recited a version of Stein’s lecture on theater, “Plays,” before performing another solo play, “The Myopia,” in 2010. Unfortunately, in “Jonas” the swirling, incantatory language often obscures what is already an opaque narrative. Although “Jonas” contains passages that rivet the attention with their lyricism and evocative detail, it tends to float past in a milky swirl without making much of an impression.

While the rusty mechanics of “The Patsy” are pleasingly lubricated by Mr. Greenspan’s freewheeling, nonnaturalistic approach, his own “Jonas” might benefit from a stricter adherence to the logic of linear narrative. We keep losing our place in the story, and with it at least some of our interest too.

692 2011-07-27 “We have now seen two consecutive months of generally improving prices; however, we might have a long way to go before we see a real recovery,” said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.& P. home price indexes. “Sustained increases in home prices over several months and better annual results need to be seen before we can confirm real estate market recovery,” he said in a statement released with the survey.

The data showed that prices in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa reached new lows, down nearly 50 percent or more since the peaks of 2005-6, the survey shows.

The overall index in May was down compared with May 2010, by 4.5 percent. That reflected a decline in prices in 19 of the 20 metropolitan areas when compared with the previous year.

The District of Columbia was the area with the only annual price increase, while Minneapolis, where home prices were up 2.6 percent in May and 0.1 percent in April, had the biggest fall in prices from May last year, with an 11.7 percent drop.

Barbara T. Jandric, the president of Edina Realty in Minneapolis, said that the drop from last year reflected prices of many foreclosed homes. But in recent months the profile of houses being sold was starting to grow sounder, with fewer foreclosure sales as a percentage of the whole.

“We still have quite a few of those sales in our market, but we see that we maybe hit our peak,” she said.

In addition, the firm has noticed more buyers on the higher end of the market, she said.

“So for the first time in many, many years, in that segment of the market we are seeing shortages of listings,” she said. “For us, it is another glimmer of hope that the market is really slowly, slowly trying to come back.”

Analysts said that the spring uptick started in April and was likely to dwindle by October, when weak demand typically drags down home prices.

In addition, other variables in the economy are deflating hopes for a housing rebound, including a struggling jobs market in which the unemployment rate is at 9.2 percent and consumer confidence is at depressed levels, said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight.

“Things do not look very favorable on the housing front since the employment situation has taken a turn for the worse in May and June,” he said in a research note. “Going forward, the Case-Shiller indexes are likely to post increases during the home-buying season, and then turn down again.”
693 2011-07-27 LONDON — BP reported a profit in the second quarter Tuesday, saying higher oil and gas prices had made up for lower production and rising costs.

The British company reported profit of $5.6 billion in the period April through June, below the average forecast of $6 billion from 12 analysts surveyed by Reuters. That compared to a loss of $17 billion in the comparable period last year, when BP had to set aside billions of dollars to deal with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

Profit in the second quarter was 21 percent below the $7.1 billion it generated in the first quarter.

“We expect the momentum of our recovery to build into 2012 and 2013 as new projects come on stream” and as “uncertainties reduce,” BP’s chief executive, Robert Dudley, said in a statement.

BP said it expected nine new projects to come on stream in 2012 and 2013, including in Angola, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Dudley is focusing on BP’s exploration business outside the United States, while still trying to regain permission for new drilling projects in the Gulf of Mexico.

713 2011-07-28 Before then, through the Anglican Church, Mr. Stott had led a revival of evangelical Christianity in Britain, exhorting Britons to find personal salvation by repenting sin and accepting Jesus as their savior.

But he also demanded that evangelicals look beyond liturgy and Christian tradition and remain engaged in worldly matters — “to take more responsible attitudes toward economics, the arts, politics and culture in general,” as Mark A. Noll, a University of Notre Dame professor and scholar of the movement, said in an interview in 2007.

“And perhaps most importantly,” Professor Noll added, Mr. Stott became “a patron, mentor, friend and encourager of thousands of pastors, students and laypeople from the newer Christian parts of the world.” He became a bridge, Professor Noll said, “between the West and the rising Christian world.”

Mr. Stott was dedicated to helping the poor in developing countries, what he termed the Majority World. Using royalties from his books, he set up trusts to help gifted students from the developing world earn doctorates abroad and then return to their native countries to teach in theological seminaries.

For all his fame on several continents, Mr. Stott’s travels and appearances were remarkably devoid of pomp, befitting his simple message of reason and faith and his unassuming demeanor. Those in his ministries knew him simply as Uncle John. In his later years, he lived in a two-room apartment over the garage of a London rectory, and for many years he kept a small cottage on the Welsh coast, where he did much of his prodigious writing in longhand and, until 2001, without electricity.

“Pride is without doubt the greatest temptation of Christian leaders,” Mr. Stott said in 2006 during a visit to the United States. “And I’m very well aware of the dangers of being feted and don’t enjoy it and don’t think one should enjoy it.”

Believing the college campus to be the most effective pulpit from which to preach, he frequently led weeklong evangelist meetings at universities in Australia, Asia, Africa, North America and elsewhere around the world. One event drew as many as 18,000 students. Until 2003 he was an active vice president of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students.

“I declare myself an impenitent believer in the power of preaching,” he told an evangelical group in New York in 2006, by then a frail and stooped figure walking with a cane. “The pew cannot rise higher than the pulpit.”

Mr. Stott, a leading evangelical theologian, was regarded as the framer of the Lausanne Covenant, a declaration of the movement’s beliefs and global aspirations. Drafted in Switzerland in 1974 at an international evangelical congress, it is regarded as a 20th-century milestone of evangelicalism.

Mr. Stott was the author of about 50 books published in 65 languages. Among his best known are “Basic Christianity” (1958), “Christ the Controversialist” (1970) and “The Cross of Christ” (1986).

“Basic Christianity” alone has been translated into more than 60 languages and has sold more than 2.5 million copies, according to the John Stott Ministries, which said his books have sold more than eight million copies worldwide. His last book — he himself described it as such — was “The Radical Disciple: Some Neglected Aspects of Our Calling,” published in 2010.

“To read Stott is to see someone practicing ‘thoughtful allegiance’ to Scripture,” David Brooks wrote in The New York Times in an admiring column 1n 2004 titled, “Who Is John Stott?”

“For him, Christianity means probing the mysteries of Christ. He is always exploring paradoxes. Jesus teaches humility, so why does he talk about himself so much? What does it mean to gain power through weakness, or freedom through obedience? In many cases the truth is not found in the middle of apparent opposites, but on both extremes simultaneously.”

The books have become staples of evangelicalism, said David Neff, editor of the evangelical publication Christianity Today. “Almost anyone who is a leader in American evangelicalism has read those books and been shaped by them.”

John Robert Walmsley Stott was born in London on April 27, 1921, the youngest of three children of Sir Arnold W. Stott, a prominent physician and an agnostic, and his wife, Emily, a Lutheran who attended All Souls. His older sisters died before him. A lifelong celibate, he left no immediate survivors.

The young Mr. Stott originally intended to train for the diplomatic service, but influenced by the Christian Gospel, he changed plans while still in preparatory school, determined to enter the Anglican Church.

He graduated from Trinity College at Cambridge in 1943; transferred to Ridley Hall Theological College, also at Cambridge; and was ordained a minister in the Church of England in 1945. He started as an assistant curate at All Souls Church. After receiving a master’s degree at Cambridge in 1947, he advanced, at the age of 29, to rector of the church in 1950. When he turned rector emeritus in 1975, he moved from the rectory to a modest apartment over its garage.

The British government acknowledged his contributions in 2006 by naming him a Commander of the British Empire. He was appointed a chaplain to the queen in 1959 and served in that post until he reached retirement age in 1991. In 2005, Time magazine selected him as one of the world’s “100 Most Influential People.” He retired from the public ministry in 2007.

An avid birder and bird photographer, Mr. Stott took his binoculars and cameras on all his travels and wrote a book about the many species he encountered. Titled “The Birds Our Teachers: Biblical Lessons From a Lifelong Bird-Watcher” (1999), the book is illustrated with his own photographs.

At Mr. Stott’s death at the retirement home, his friends and associates were at his bedside, reading Scriptures and listening to Handel’s "Messiah," the All Souls Church Web site said.

“The evangelical world has lost one of its greatest spokesmen,” Mr. Graham said in a statement on Wednesday, “and I have lost one of my close personal friends and advisers. I look forward to seeing him again when I go to heaven.”
714 2011-07-28 Until this week, Wall Street has shrugged off each new low in the debt-limit debate, confident — in a whistling-past-the-graveyard kind of way — that Washington would raise the on time.

Many Republican politicians have insisted that the economy and the country could shrug off a default. Up to Wednesday, the most conservative members of the House seemed to be welcoming a default. They refused to support a plan to raise the limit — and impose overly harsh spending cuts — put forward by Speaker .

The cost of this fecklessness should now be clear to everyone. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 200 points on Wednesday and is down 421 points since Friday when Mr. Boehner left waiting for a phone call that never came about a deal that never closed.

With bond-rating agencies issuing dire warnings, investors have begun to demand higher rates on that come due in August. Prices have surged on , which are used by investors to protect against default and by speculators to bet on the likelihood of default.

On Wednesday, with Mr. Boehner warning his troops to “get your ass in line” to keep things from getting worse, several hard-line members began switching their votes and chances increased that his plan would pass the House. Whether that gets Washington any closer to a tolerable deal isn’t clear.

It would be reassuring to chalk up the market volatility to endgame tension. Even if default is avoided, the prolonged stalemate has left the vulnerable to losing its AAA rating. For credit raters, the issue is political risk — the danger of dysfunctional politics leading to continued fiscal disarray. The risk is especially high if any deal only raises the debt limit until early next year, as called for in the speaker’s plan. The potential repercussions of a downgrade include an even larger deficit, as higher interest rates raise borrowing costs for the government, as well as higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. As money that might have been spent or invested is instead used to pay debt, the slowing economy would slow even more and joblessness would rise.
715 2011-07-28 The Russian government cautioned in a statement issued Wednesday that it would “not leave unanswered the unfriendly steps” taken by the United States in barring several dozen Russian officials from receiving American visas over their involvement in the detention and death of the Russian lawyer Sergei L. Magnitsky two years ago. It was one of the Obama administration’s sharpest responses yet to human rights abuses in Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement that the visa ban, coming into force despite the thaw in the two countries’ relations, represented “an instrument of the past.”
716 2011-07-28 The managers were Willie Randolph, who was sabotaged by the front office — not Minaya — and by some players in the clubhouse, too. Jerry Manuel was decent but diffident, as if awaiting the chop.

Now that era is over, and Beltran has his name attached to it because he lasted more than six and a half seasons, and personified the time with one signature called third strike to end the seventh and last game of the 2006 National League Championship Series. Even if he had taken one last lusty “Casey at the Bat” swing, and missed, perhaps his fate would have been different. But he gawked.

The sad part was that Beltran came back from injuries this season and performed with energy and wisdom and skill. The fans learned to like him, while knowing he was not long for this part of the world.

The logic of unloading an older, expensive player before the July 31 deadline has permeated baseball. Even Beltran sees the wisdom of it. The Mets did it notably in 1992 when they jettisoned David Cone, a signal of no más to the fans and the Met players.

The Detroit Tigers rolled the dice when they traded for Doyle Alexander and gave up John Smoltz, who merely pitched superbly for the Braves for a couple of decades. So much for baseball wisdom.

Did the Mets have a fatal flaw in their stewardship of the past decade? Minaya was a terrific scout and personable recruiter, particularly when the Wilpons had money, but the older stars got hurt or, like Delgado, declined to lead. The clubhouse leader for a while was Cliff Floyd, who kept an eye on David Wright, and would have done the same for Jose Reyes, except that Reyes was years away from maturity.

Now the Mets are run by Sandy Alderson, and Terry Collins has already won part of the crowd with his fire, but who knows where this organization is headed because of the Madoff scandal?

In the middle of all this, Beltran, a quiet man, finally became assertive. When the Mets were looking to unload him in recent weeks, he let them know that he would go only to a contender with money. They were not about to let him loose in their own division, so he is bound for the world champions.

Mets fans can now console themselves that at least Beltran did not go to the Phillies or the Braves. That is what it is like to be a Mets fan these days, this decade.

Beltran is coyly tossing around hints that he might be favorable to coming back to the Mets next season when he will be a free agent and forced to sign for much less money. Imagine that, a second Carlos Beltran era. Hardly all his fault, but one Beltran era would seem to be quite enough.
717 2011-07-28 In a conference call to his membership on Sunday, Mr. Boehner reminded his caucus members that they had a duty to the nation, even if they did not like what he was asking them to do.

“Let me thank all of you for your patience, and for your confidence, and for your commitment to our country,” Mr. Boehner said, according to participants on the call. “We’re doing the right thing, and you all know that the right thing isn’t always the easiest thing to do.”

The speaker has used the many resources at his disposal to coax along his fellow Republicans, from listening sessions in which House leaders sought to educate Republican newcomers on the issue, to an informal party last week. It was held in a storied room on the first floor of the Capitol known as the Board of Education, where another speaker from , Nicholas Longworth IV, used to gather with colleagues during Prohibition to unwind. Mr. Boehner fed the freshmen debt limit talk along with pizza, sliders and chicken wings.

But it remained a tough sell, with Mr. Boehner in danger of losing the vote, particularly after a report showed that the House plan fell short of the savings estimated by the speaker. The leadership regrouped, beefed up the savings in the measure, used the party meeting to make its case and appeared to gain ground headed into Thursday’s floor fight.

Though Mr. Boehner seems to have temporarily regained his footing with his Henry V performance in the party meeting — he received his third standing ovation in three days — he is hardly out of danger.

Even if he prevails in the House vote expected on Thursday, the next few days could still spell the difference between success and catastrophe for Mr. Boehner, whose Republican establishment temperament diverges sharply from the fire-breathing conservatives among the rank and file.

While it seems unlikely now, getting the Senate to swallow the House proposal would be a major victory for the speaker, who will have delivered the solution to the debt impasse over the objections of Democrats and . But if Republican intransigence is blamed for a default or his caucus is forced to accept some version of the Senate Democratic plan — an outcome some House members would consider far worse than allowing the nation to not pay its bills — Mr. Boehner could be weakened.

Still, many Republicans consider him safe because of the general good will he has built with many members despite their differences. And there are few signals from other Republican leaders that they are ready, or even want, to take him on.

“I find it hard to believe that even if some critics have a beef with Boehner on how the final debt limit solution will look (and surely some will), that they will have the courage or the inclination to try to oust him,” John Feehery, a party strategist who served as a top aide to Speaker , wrote on his blog on Wednesday. “Boehner has done a good job.”

In interviews in recent weeks, roughly two dozen members, even some who vehemently oppose Mr. Boehner’s plan, said they respected how he had conducted his negotiations with the White House. And they said they appreciated his inclusiveness, especially freshmen who expected otherwise as they pushed early on for more aggressive cuts.

“Leadership gets great for having been very straightforward,” said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of .

Representative Renee Ellmers of said she came to Washington suspicious of Mr. Boehner. At Tea Party rallies before she was elected, she heard that he was part of the problem.

“When I got here I realized that wasn’t the case at all,” she said. “I was told he wasn’t conservative. He is conservative, and that’s what I tell other people in our discussions. He has been great to all the freshmen.”

Allies of the speaker say they expect that most of the 87 Republican freshmen will back the House debt limit plan in the end.

Despite all the vitriol in the debt limit fight, Democrats have been careful to not go too far in impugning Mr. Boehner — Senator of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, on Wednesday called him a “good and reasonable man” — in the event they have to work with him. But they have also sought to portray him as a captive of the right wing of his caucus.

Still, Democrats are keeping the door open for Mr. Boehner, hoping that in the final resolution of the impasse he will have to join with them in enacting a debt limit increase that extends through 2012. At the moment, though, Mr. Boehner is not ready to walk through the opening.
718 2011-07-28 MSNBC said in a statement this week, “There is no agreement with Mr. Sharpton to host a program; however, it is important to note that Comcast plays no role in either the independent editorial decision-making of MSNBC or the selection of its hosts.”

Separately, Comcast said in a statement, “Comcast pledged from the day we announced the transaction that we would not interfere with NBCUniversal’s news operations, including at MSNBC. We have not and we will not.”

Mr. Sharpton has been a guest host for the 6 p.m. hour on MSNBC for most of the last month, effectively replacing Cenk Uygur, who confirmed last week that the channel had decided not to give him the time slot permanently.

Executives at MSNBC say they believe that Mr. Sharpton, a regular guest on the channel for years, may shore up the ratings at 6 p.m., a crucial hour that helps to set up the channel’s prime-time programming. But they emphasized that no decision had been made on hiring Mr. Sharpton. He said he had not been paid for his role as a guest host.

Mr. Sharpton threw his organizational weight behind the Comcast bid for NBC twice, first in his letter to the F.C.C. in May 2010, which said that his group had “for several years” had a “productive, honest and open dialogue at the highest levels of the company,” referring to Comcast, “and we are confident that this positive relationship will continue to prosper after the joint venture is approved.”

In December 2010, in the final stretch of the merger review, Mr. Sharpton reaffirmed his support when the National Action Network and other African-American leadership groups signed on to a diversity action plan with Comcast. The plan included a commitment by Comcast to seek “the expanded participation of minorities on its news and public affairs programming.”

To that end, Comcast said it would consider suggestions from its newly established diversity councils, including the National African American Diversity Council. That council includes Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the chairman of the National Action Network, but not Mr. Sharpton.

In a telephone interview this week, Mr. Sharpton said there was no connection between his past support for Comcast and his current role as a host for MSNBC. “How could there be a connection?” he asked, noting that at the time of the merger review, there were no open time slots on the channel.

In April, Mr. Sharpton presented a National Action Network award to Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. Mr. Sharpton dismissed any connection there, too: “The year before, we honored Jeff Zucker,” he said, referring to the former chief executive of NBCUniversal. “Did Zucker give me ‘S.N.L.’?”

Mr. Sharpton said that if he were to join MSNBC, he would not leave the National Action Network, but would abstain from decisions that conflicted with his position in television.

Reports last week about Mr. Sharpton’s impending hiring created a stir among some black journalists who say that cable news channels had shortchanged minorities for many years.

On its Web site last week, the National Association of Black Journalists wrote that while Mr. Sharpton was about to advance to a permanent position, “there are no black journalists who can tout a similar promotion.”
719 2011-07-28 The decision was unveiled in an unusual fashion last week, when American Airlines announced that it would split a $38 billion plane order between Boeing, its longtime supplier, and Airbus, Boeing’s European rival.

Airbus announced several months ago that it would redesign its A320 models to accommodate more fuel-efficient engines. Boeing executives had said publicly that they were leaning toward building a new plane by 2020.

But Mr. McNerney told the analysts on Wednesday that two things had changed in Boeing’s calculations.

With Airbus quickly picking up orders for the plane with new engines, American and other airlines made it clear to Boeing that they would rather have “greater certainty in the midterm” on fuel savings than wait for “the more perfect solution,” Mr. McNerney said.

He said that Boeing’s studies also showed that it would be riskier than previously expected to set up a production system for an entirely new plane, especially given that production rates have been surging for the single-aisle jets.

Mr. McNerney said that Boeing believed that new engines would yield 10 to 12 percent in fuel savings on the 737s. Boeing officials said the changes could enable the 737 to retain what Boeing claims is an 8 percent advantage in total operating costs over the A320, even after that plane has new engines as well.

Boeing has announced plans to expand 737 production to 42 planes a year by 2014. Mr. McNerney said that the order backlog was so substantial that Boeing was likely to increase that to 50 or 60 planes by the end of the decade.

Boeing reported that its earnings increased 20 percent to $941 million, or $1.25 a share, from $787 million, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent to $16.5 billion from $15.6 billion. Analysts had expected Boeing to earn 97 cents a share.

The company raised its earnings forecast for all of 2011 to $3.90 to $4.10 a share. Its earlier forecast was $3.80 to $4 a share.

The company’s stock rose 47 cents to $70.63, on a day when the overall market was down sharply.
720 2011-07-28 Those who are sensitive about their size may also be quick to cut out labels. Rozlind Power, 27, an events planner in Houston who used to sell clothes in a high-end boutique, said it’s common for people to remove labels if the size is bigger than their self-image. “It’s understandable when sizes vary so much,” Ms. Power said. “I wear an XS at Banana Republic but have a bridesmaid’s dress by Betsey Johnson that is Size 10, which I would probably cut out if I had to look at it all the time.”

Zak Graff, 34, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles, said he likes the cut and fit of the Spanish brand Zara, but “the labels drive me crazy because they are 2 to 3 inches long and stacked one on top of another.” (Any clothing sold in the European Union must have attached labels translated into every member country’s language.)

Mr. Graff keeps a seam ripper in his dopp kit to remove such aesthetic and potentially allergenic offenses. “I take out the labels when I cut off the hanging price tag,” he said. “It’s this whole process after I buy something new.”

But before he can remove a label, he has to actually see it. Some brands, like the French active-wear line Aigle, as well as Elie Tahari and Josie Natori have within the last three years begun using clear labels. Made of flexible plastic, these are usually in the side seam. “It’s very much about comfort,” said Ilse Metchek, president of the California Fashion Association, which represents the state’s apparel manufacturers. “But it’s also a reflection of fabric being expensive and plastic being cheap, and there’s no sewing edges of the plastic label. Just a laser cut. Easy.”

Tagless labels, which first appeared a decade ago but have become more prevalent within the last two to three years, involve either stamping or ironing text onto the garment. “People really have issues with labels,” said Rick Elmore, vice president for product development at Hanesbrands Inc., one of the first companies to feature tagless labels. “We were hearing it again and again.”

Athletic-wear brands including Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Puma soon followed, and now tagless labels can be found on garments made by many top brands including Banana Republic, J. Crew, Gap, Ann Taylor and H & M.

While there were early complaints that the ink used in tagless labels flaked and became prickly after several washings, the technology has improved. “The digital presses are more precise so we use less ink and it settles into the garment, so it doesn’t look as plasticky and it’s softer,” said Shawn Neville, vice president for retail branding at Avery Dennison Corporation, which develops and makes labels. “That’s why you see more well-known brands going tagless these days.”

But tagless labels can fade over time, according to Scott Schuman, who writes the Sartorialist fashion blog. “And then you end up putting on your T-shirt backwards, which is a total pain,” he said. He believes labels are an important design feature that denote quality and even add value like an artist’s signature on a print. Indeed, vintage clothes with intact labels sell for higher prices than those without. “We all like to complain about labels but we secretly love them,” Mr. Schuman said.

Nontraditional designer labels can be a mark of distinction. Consider Martin Margiela’s blank white label, Stella McCartney’s delicate metal chain, Peggy Jennings’s bit of lace and Rick Owens’s two slim, parallel gray ribbons.

Ken Downing, fashion director at Neiman Marcus, said, “With many designers less intrigued with the idea of logos, the artistic tag begins a new conversation with the consumer,” serving as an “insiders’ inside message.”

Mr. Owens described his label as an artisanal gesture. “It was always important to me that there be a personal, intimate connection between what I did and whoever responded to it,” he said.

And even Mr. Graff in Los Angeles leaves the iconic plaid tag in his Burberry suit because he thinks it’s a “unique design element.”

Marcia Sherrill, 50, a handbag designer in New York, said she has a “moment of bonding” looking at the designer labels in her clothes before getting dressed. “To see the Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent brands is a reminder that this little girl from Alabama made good,” she said.

That doesn’t stop her, though, from putting a Band-Aid over them to keep them from scratching.
721 2011-07-28 The prime minister of acknowledged on Wednesday that his country had fundamentally changed as a result of the attacks on a youth camp and government complex last week, but he vowed to protect the culture of openness that is a source of Norwegian pride.

The attacks have prompted officials to start reassessing Norway’s policy on public security, which seemed defined by a belief that bad things happen elsewhere. , a self-described Christian crusader who has admitted to the attacks, appeared to face few obstacles when he detonated a car bomb on a busy government plaza last Friday, killing 8 people, then traveled 19 miles and took a ferry to the youth camp on the island of Utoya, where he slaughtered at least 68 people.

“It’s absolutely possible to have an open, democratic, inclusive society, and at the same time have security measures and not be naive,” Prime Minister told reporters in Oslo. “I think what we have seen is that there is going to be one Norway before and one Norway after July 22,” he said. “But I hope and also believe that the Norway we will see after will be more open, a more tolerant society than what we had before.”

Mr. Stoltenberg announced that the government would create a commission independent of the police to investigate the attacks as well as law enforcement agencies’ response to them.

The police have come under fire for the seemingly slow pace of their response. It took commandos about 90 minutes to reach the island, a delay that critics say likely cost dozens of lives. Helicopters were unavailable, and police had to commandeer civilian boats to reach the island.

Police officers from the precinct in Honefoss, close to Utoya, offered new details about the operation in a news conference on Wednesday.
722 2011-07-28 Economists said the drop in the so-called core category of factory orders that is used as a proxy for business spending plans was troubling and could yield slower growth in spending by businesses on equipment and software in the third quarter.

That measure — nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft — slipped 0.4 percent last month after a 1.7 percent rise in May.

“The June decline is somewhat worrisome regarding the vigor of the trend in capital spending,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company in New York. “This is particularly so given that the June data probably predates any debt ceiling-driven precaution on the part of business behavior.”

Durable goods are items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more. Though orders tend to be volatile, last month’s unexpected decline suggested factory activity was slowing.

The Fed report, based on comments by business contacts in the central bank’s 12 districts, also presented a glum picture.

While most districts saw modest hiring gains, labor markets remained soft, the Fed said. Home sales were little changed since the beige book issued in early June, and most districts reporting on home prices found them flat or declining.

Against that backdrop, wage pressures were subdued and price pressures moderated somewhat, the Fed said.

The economy has been hurt by high gasoline costs and supply chain disruptions after the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but economists had hoped the recovery would be picking up speed by now.

Businesses, sitting on $2 trillion in cash, have been spending heavily on equipment and software. Economists said businesses still had pent-up demand, but much would depend on developments in the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington over the next days.

A range of American companies — like Emerson Electric and Corning — on Wednesday warned that demand was weakening.

Emerson Electric said American and European economies had “clearly slowed” in the last two months, sending its own shares down. Other industrial shares were also lower across the board.

Brian Levitt, an economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York, said a resolution of the budget standoff in Washington ahead of an impending deadline for Congress to raise the nation’s borrowing limit could help lift the cloud hanging over the economy.

“We’re going to need some clarity over the next week, and if events turn out as the market hopes it will, there is still some impetus for growth as we head out into year-end,” he said.
723 2011-07-28 Stanley A. Nabi, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said investors were also focused on a number of companies with earnings this week that had some disappointing aspects, like 3M. The company said on Tuesday that it had record second-quarter sales but full-year growth would be affected by the Japan earthquake.

“I think this has raised a red flag of caution,” he said.

“On the Nasdaq, the small caps are getting hurt more than the general market. On a relative basis, they have become considered overvalued,” Mr. Nabi said.

The Federal Reserve’s survey of economic conditions in 12 districts throughout the country, known as the beige book, said on Wednesday that some companies were already feeling the effect of the uncertainty as the debt talks dragged on and were delaying business decisions.

Advertising and consulting firms in the Boston district, for example, “say their services may be some of the first cut if companies become pessimistic and retrench, so they fear that failure to resolve the debt ceiling issue could have huge negative ramifications for their firms and for the general economy,” the report said.

The survey also reported that growth had moderated, based on information collected on or before July 15.

But it was the lack of a deal to raise the debt limit in the United States that has been predominantly hanging over the financial markets for the last week. And while there was little movement to bring the two sides in Washington closer to a deal, there was plenty of action in the markets.

“The downgrade of U.S. credit is not going to be a good thing for us,” said Laura LaRosa, director of fixed income at the investment firm Glenmede. “If the U.S. gets downgraded, that is a disrupting event for the markets, no matter what. We have never been anything but triple AAA.”

Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said the negotiations, “or lack thereof, continue to command much of the investment community’s attention right now.”

“But the risk that the political dysfunction will take us too close to the brink increases with each passing day,” he wrote in a research note.
724 2011-07-28 Moody’s cut Cyprus’s long-term government bond rating two levels to Baa1 — still an investment grade — from A2. It assigned a negative outlook, signaling that the next move may be another downgrade, and cut its short-term ratings.

An explosion at a naval base this month badly damaged the Vasilikos power plant in Cyprus. That has caused blackouts, and Moody’s said that the power shortage was likely to hurt the economy, which it now expects to stagnate this year and expand only 1 percent next year.

Moody’s also cited the “increasingly fractious domestic political climate” and “the material risk that at least some Cypriot banks will require state support over the medium term as a result of their exposure to Greece.”

Cypriot bonds fell on Wednesday and Italian and Spanish bonds dropped as investors became increasingly concerned whether the package assembled by European leaders to help Greece’s troubled finances and restore confidence in the euro zone would be enough. The yield on Cyprus’s 10-year bond rose 0.13 percentage points to 10.043 percent.

Banks in Cyprus continue to hold “substantial” Greek debt and will be affected in the case of a sovereign debt default, Moody’s said.

Moody’s also said it was concerned about the large role the banking sector plays in the Cypriot economy. Bank assets amount to about 600 percent of gross domestic product in Cyprus, excluding foreign bank subsidiaries, it said.

The July 11 explosion that destroyed the plant and killed 13 people also rattled the government. Costas Papacostas, the defense minister, and Lt. Gen. Petros Tsalikidis, chief of the national guard, resigned amid criticism that they had failed to take steps that could have prevented the accident. Some 98 containers of explosives were left stacked for more than two years in an open field near the power station.

The political friction might make it harder for the center-left government, which does not have an absolute majority in Parliament, to push through spending cuts and privatizations announced on July 1.

“This adverse development increases implementation risk to the government’s plans, many of which will require not just cross-party support but also acceptance by the trade unions,” Moody’s said.

On Tuesday, a number of parties accused the government of backtracking on reforms, Reuters reported from Nicosia.

Cyprus, which adopted the euro on Jan. 1, 2008, is seeking to bring down a budget deficit that hit 5.3 percent of gross domestic product last year.

“The Cypriot banks have been considered safer than the Greek banks and have received a lot of the deposit outflow from Greece,” Panicos Demetriades, a professor at the University of Leicester in England, said, adding that the banks have large businesses in Russia. “However, the problem is that a small country like Cyprus cannot afford to support such a large banking system if it gets into trouble.”

736 2011-07-29 Polly Platt, a Hollywood producer, designer and screenwriter who was responsible for the aesthetic of several of Peter Bogdanovich’s early films, died on Wednesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 72.

The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, her family said.

Mr. Bogdanovich was Ms. Platt’s second husband. They were married from 1962 until their divorce in 1971, and their collaboration continued afterward.

Her films for him as a production designer include “The Last Picture Show” (1971), in which she conjured a dust-bitten Texas town in the 1950s; “What’s Up, Doc?” (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal; and “Paper Moon” (1973), starring Mr. O’Neal and his daughter, Tatum, in which Ms. Platt brought the Depression-era Midwest to life.

She also collaborated with Mr. Bogdanovich on “Targets” (1968), the first film he directed under his own name. (His directorial credit, as Derek Thomas, came on “Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women” in 1968.)

Besides serving as the production designer of “Targets,” Ms. Platt conceived, with Mr. Bogdanovich, the original story on which his screenplay was based. The film, about a Vietnam veteran-turned-sniper, stars Tim O’Kelly and Boris Karloff.
737 2011-07-29 Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.

It’s not exactly a “Left Behind” story, but there were a fair number of conservative policy wonks and political operators in Texas who didn’t catch the train to Washington in 2000. Now, as Gov. Rick Perry dances closer and closer to the presidential flame, those Texas Republicans might get another chance.

The conventional wisdom just a few months ago was that the rest of the country was weary of Texans, that even if they were in a mood to put a Republican back in the White House, nobody with boots should apply for the job.

But maybe 2012 is like 1980, and the same electorate that voted for Ronald Reagan only eight years after voting for a fellow Californian, Richard M. Nixon, might vote for Mr. Perry eight years after electing George W. Bush.

The Texas Republican Party’s fortunes, and its candidates, rose through the years in a series that might be called “firsts since Reconstruction” — first Republican state treasurer since, first agriculture commissioner since, then lieutenant governor, land commissioner and so on. Texas Republicans haven’t lost a statewide election since 1994, and their decade of ascent was capped by Mr. Bush’s election to the presidency in 2000.

It was like a startup company. People who hired on when there was no real good reason to think being a Texas Republican was a good idea — back in the 1980s, say — found themselves on the plane to Washington to head government agencies, run regulatory boards, staff the White House and the political campaigns for Republicans from all over the country, and got a disproportionate share of the most coveted ambassadorial postings.
738 2011-07-29 ATLANTA (AP) — The Rev. Howard Creecy Jr., the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, died here on Thursday, seven months after taking office. He was 57.

The cause was apparently a heart attack, said Damien Conners, the organization’s national program director.

Mr. Creecy, pastor of the Olivet Church in Fayette County, Ga., was elected president of the civil rights group in January after the position was declined by Bernice King, daughter of its co-founder, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Before that, Mr. Creecy had been the interim president of the conference, which was founded in 1957.

According to his biography on the Olivet Church Web site, Mr. Creecy, a native of Mobile, Ala., was a third-generation preacher who shared pastor duties at Olivet with his father, the Rev. Howard Creecy Sr., from 2002 until his father died in 2008. Mr. Creecy was a graduate of Morehouse College and received a doctor of divinity degree from Abotra Bible Institute and Seminary.

Mr. Creecy was senior pastor of Saint Peter Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta for 26 years before going to Olivet.

In addition to his duties at Olivet, he was director of the Office of Chaplain Services for the Atlanta Fulton County government, the organization’s highest-ranking ecclesiastical position. He was the first African-American to serve in that capacity.
739 2011-07-29 The Mets researched Wheeler extensively. They knew he dominated during his senior year at East Paulding High School in Georgia, knew he was drafted sixth over all by the Giants in 2009 and knew that he struck out 98 batters in 88 innings with a 3.98 earned run average for Class A San Jose this season, a team that plays in the hitter-friendly California League.

They also knew he came from a baseball family. Barry played in an amateur men’s league for 15 years, and his wife, Elaine, was a competitive softball player, often bringing a playpen into the dugout at weekend tournaments so she could keep an eye on her children during games. Wheeler’s older brother, Adam, was drafted by the Yankees in 2001 and played four seasons in their minor-league system before developing shoulder problems.

Unlike his brother, however, Wheeler’s path to professional baseball was not always clear. As recently as age 15, Wheeler was not selected by any of the teams at the elite East Cobb Baseball summer program near his family home in Dallas, Ga. As he said Thursday, “No one wanted me until I was 16.”

That was when everything changed. Tony Boyd, the head coach at East Paulding, said there was a marked difference in Wheeler during his junior year, when his lanky frame filled out and his pitching repertory deepened.

During Wheeler’s senior year, he set a school record with 149 strikeouts in 76 innings and threw a no-hitter in the second round of the state playoffs. “It was one of the best games I’ve seen,” Boyd said.

After being drafted by the Giants, Wheeler said, he immediately began imagining a day when he would join the team’s vaunted rotation. Pitching alongside a star like Tim Lincecum was a pleasant dream to chase.

That was why Wheeler’s initial reaction to hearing he had been traded was surprise. He initially thought he was not going to be traded at all. Wheeler woke up Wednesday morning and saw on his Twitter feed that his teammate and friend Gary Brown was rumored to be involved in the deal for Beltran.

“Then I went downstairs and turned on the television and saw that actually I was the one who was probably being traded,” Wheeler said.

Once he got over the initial jolt, however, Wheeler said he saw the positives of the situation: the Giants have a deep core of young pitchers, making his own path to the major leagues more difficult.

The Mets, on the other hand, have been seeking young pitching. Wheeler is expected to join Class A St. Lucie, and Alderson said it was possible Wheeler could be in the major leagues by the end of 2012.

“I was kind of shocked at first,” Wheeler said of the trade. “Then I thought about it, and the Mets have a lot of young pitchers starting to come up in their organization, and I think that’s probably better for me.”

Wheeler concedes that command has been a weakness at times, though he points out that early with the Giants he was instructed to change his mechanics. Growing up, Wheeler used a high leg kick and raised his arms while twisting away from the plate during his windup.

Recently, Wheeler returned to his former delivery and he said it had been effective.

“I’ve had two walks total in my last two games,” he said. “I feel very confident in all of my pitches right now.”

That arsenal — which includes two types of fastballs in the mid-90-mile-per-hour range, a hard-dipping curveball, a slider and a changeup — intrigued the Mets.

Wheeler insists he will not forget his humble beginnings. He recently used a portion of his reported $3.3 million signing bonus from the Giants to purchase a new scoreboard for East Paulding, replacing the dingy, rusted-over model he pitched in front of.

The new scoreboard has an inning-by-inning display, with LED lighting, and at the bottom is a sign that informs fans the board was donated by Zack Wheeler.

“Zack didn’t even want them to have a sign,” Barry said. “But once they did, we made sure they got that one right.”
740 2011-07-29 Whether Jefferson County’s commissioners will embrace the proposal is unclear. Rate increases are their foremost concern. They said one potential rate schedule being floated would lead to an annual increase of 8 percent in sewer rates for four years or more, an unacceptable level.

The governor’s finance director, David Perry, said the plan included no specific rate schedules, but called for a reduction in debt that could be achieved several ways.

Commissioners also complained that they had been given nothing in writing on Thursday and could not yet properly evaluate the proposal. Commissioner T. Joe Knight said he had agreed to the seven-day standstill out of deference to the governor.

Jefferson County’s debacle began years ago, when it was ordered by a federal court to rebuild its failing sewer system. It had to issue bonds to finance the huge construction costs, and followed consultants’ advice that it lower its borrowing costs by issuing bonds linked to derivatives, which were supposed to protect the county if interest rates rose. The revenues from sewer ratepayers were pledged to pay back the debt.

But the revenue projections were too optimistic, the bond deals were plagued by pay-to-play and bid-rigging scandals, and the complex bond-derivative structures collapsed in the financial turmoil of 2008. The costs ballooned, and now the county owes about $3.2 billion. Some officials who helped with the bond deals have been convicted of corruption charges, and some of the banks have been forced to pay back some of their fees under regulatory pressure. In November 2009, J.P. Morgan made the county a $75 million payment as part of a settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With other federal investigations and prosecutions continuing, county residents are increasingly unwilling to help pay debts incurred amid so much impropriety.

This summer’s flirtation with bankruptcy grew out of a sudden and steep shortfall in the county’s general fund revenues, which are separate from the sewer revenues. In April, the State Supreme Court declared an important county tax unconstitutional on technical grounds, cutting off 44 percent of the county’s discretionary revenues. Despite appeals to the state legislature for help, little was done, and the county had to lay off nearly 550 employees, around a quarter of the workforce, and make deep cuts in services.

As this was happening, Mr. Young, the court-appointed receiver for the sewer system, issued a report recommending a 25 percent immediate increase in the rates paid by households on the system to pay the outstanding bonds. Residents howled in protest, complaining of the previous rate increases and then the county service cuts.

With tensions high, Mr. Young then sent letters to the county, demanding that the $75 million payment from J.P. Morgan be diverted to help shore up the sewer system’s finances.

But the money represented the county’s only cash reserves, and officials saw no alternative but to declare bankruptcy. Just as they were about to file at the end of June, the governor intervened, convincing Mr. Young and the county to declare a standstill period for 30 days.

Frustrated by half-hearted legislative attempts at a solution, the governor had also been informed that the state and its taxpayers could be liable for part of the county’s ballooning debt because the state had been named in the federal order to rebuild the sewer system.

Mr. Young said the governor also had been told by bankruptcy experts that a Chapter 9 filing by the state’s most populous county would spook the municipal bond market, which is already jittery because of an analyst’s prediction of big defaults across the country, and a possible downgrade of the United States’ Treasury’s debt. If the state showed it was unwilling to help Jefferson County, it might unnerve investors considering bonds issued by other Alabama towns and counties, and even the state itself.

“A bankruptcy in Jefferson County would have a negative impact across the whole state of Alabama, and potentially all across the country,” Mr. Young said. The governor issued a statement saying he was “supportive of the seven-day extension” and looked forward to a thorough review of the creditors’ latest offer.

It was not apparent that the new terms would appease county residents, many of whom have started to think, incorrectly, that Chapter 9 would be a good way to walk away from the debt completely. Commissioners said their constituents generally favor bankruptcy, and in interviews with residents around the county, many said bankruptcy should have been declared years ago.

Spotting a reporter leaving the county courthouse on Thursday, a man in a pickup truck yelled out the question on everyone’s mind: “Did they file yet?”

Upon hearing it would take a few more days, the man cursed and drove on.
741 2011-07-29 Sure, Smurfs are blue, but who knew that they actually work blue?

The funniest moments in “The Smurfs,” a new 3-D movie featuring the old gang familiar from the 1980s television series, are either raunchy or scandalous, as much as that is possible in a half-animated film with a PG rating. There’s a scene in which a Scottish Smurf in a kilt recreates the Marilyn Monroe subway grate display. There’s a rude bit involving a portable toilet.

Those grown-up winks, along with an array of New York locations, make “The Smurfs” a surprisingly tolerable film for adults. As for their children, well, who knows with kids? But at least the writers have cleverly built in enough Smurfology that today’s youngsters will be able to get the basics of the blue universe.

Fleeing their archenemy, the evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria, who is quite funny), a half-dozen Smurfs are sucked through a wormhole and into New York City, with Gargamel and a nasty cat in hot pursuit. Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays play the young couple who befriend the Smurfs.

It’s somehow depressing that the story centers on whether Mr. Harris’s character can come up with an advertising campaign that will sell cosmetics, and the movie frequently reminds us that the gimmick of little creatures scurrying about in the human world (“Toy Story,” “Gnomeo and Juliet”) is pretty worn out. But on a hot summer day, “The Smurfs” is a decent enough excuse to haul the little ones into an air-conditioned theater.

“The Smurfs” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for fleeting ribaldry and lots of cat abuse.

Directed by Raja Gosnell; written by J. David Stem, David N. Weiss, Jay Scherick and David Ronn, based on a story by Mr. Stem and Mr. Weiss and the characters and works of Peyo; director of photography, Phil Méheux; edited by Sabrina Plisco; music by Heitor Pereira; production design by Bill Boes; costumes by Rita Ryack; visual effects supervisor, Richard R. Hoover; produced by Jordan Kerner; released by Columbia Pictures/Sony Pictures Animation. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.
742 2011-07-29 He added: “If you love the business, you have so missed it, you think, ‘Let’s keep it going.’ From a numbers standpoint, keeping everything sorted, giving everyone undivided attention, you’d like to have more time.”

There wasn’t much of that Thursday. The Patriots acquired defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, whose motivation is frequently questioned, and Chad Ochocinco, the talented deep threat whose mouth is frequently running, in stunning trades that reshaped not just the roster but also the public image of a team that strives to starve reporters of material. Haynesworth was obtained from the Washington Redskins for a fifth-round draft pick in 2013, and Ochocinco from Cincinnati for two future draft picks.

Running back Reggie Bush went from the New Orleans Saints to the Miami Dolphins, and by midday, the long-awaited trade of Philadelphia’s backup quarterback Kevin Kolb to Arizona was complete, but the details were still stunning: the Cardinals, desperate for a quarterback after Kurt Warner’s retirement following the 2009 season, would send cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and a second-round draft pick to Philadelphia. They would also give Kolb a contract that is believed to include more than $20 million guaranteed, an enormous sum for a quarterback who has started just seven games in his four-year career.

Later on came a flood of cuts, as the N.F.L. allowed players to be waived. The most prominent was quarterback Vince Young, who was released by Tennessee, and receiver Brandon Manumaleuna, who was a first-day free-agent signing by the Bears one year ago. Free-agent contracts become official Friday evening.

That’s a lot of action. But some of the best theatrics are taking place in offices behind the scenes, with agents trying to get their players signed before training camps are in full swing. Newly signed players cannot be on the field until Aug. 4, when the league year will begin after players approve the new collective bargaining agreement. Lost is the protracted massaging of negotiations, the multiple team visits, the text messages and phone calls to go over the options during the quiet weeks of the spring.

Consider Tom Condon and Ben Dogra, two of the most powerful agents in football, who work for Creative Artists Agency. Together, they represent five rookies taken in the first round of the draft. They also represent cornerbacks Antonio Cromartie and Nnamdi Asomugha, the most coveted free agent this year.

C.A.A. has a team of lawyers and researchers to help Condon and Dogra, freeing them to negotiate contracts, but the demands are mind-numbing, particularly because so many of their clients are high profile and in high demand. A Condon client, the undrafted rookie linebacker Mark Herzlich from Boston College, signed with the Giants. Now Asomugha is considering his options. And looming over all of this are the negotiations Condon will conduct for a new contract for Peyton Manning, which will make him the highest-paid player in the game.

Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said the new rules for contracts, practices and personnel were still in flux the last few days. That has complicated some transactions. But it hasn’t slowed much.

On Thursday morning, just after the trade of Bush to Miami was complete, his agent Joel Segal — who had completed a new contract for Jets receiver Santonio Holmes early Wednesday morning — summed up the N.F.L. experience this week.
743 2011-07-29 Then, breaking into English, he added, “I don’t need more pressure.” The Karmapa smiled, and then grew serious and added in Tibetan: “I don’t think I can do any more. It’s hard enough just to be the Karmapa.”

His Holiness the Karmapa, has just come through a trying time. Earlier this year, he was investigated by the Indian police who found more than $1 million in foreign currency in his residence, including more than $166,000 from China.

The Karmapa and his aides insisted that the money had been donated by devotees who flocked to India from around the world to see him. Although there is a rival who also claims the title, the Karmapa is regarded by the Dalai Lama and most Tibetans as the leader of the 900-year-old Karma Kagyu lineage, one of the four main schools in Tibetan Buddhism, with hundreds of monasteries and dharma centers in more than 60 countries.

The Karmapa’s aides said they planned to use the money to buy land for a monastery in India. But the Indian media fanned rumors that he was a Chinese spy.

To Tibetans and to scholars of Tibetan Buddhism, the notion is absurd. The Karmapa fled Tibet when he was 14, climbing out a window of his monastery to a waiting car, avoiding military checkpoints and riding a horse through the Nepalese outback to reach India. The escape was reminiscent of the Dalai Lama’s dash over the icy passes of the Himalayas in 1959.

But the rumors about the 17th Karmapa persisted in part because the Chinese government has recognized him as the legitimate leader of the Kagyu tradition, and avoided denouncing him even after his flight to India. That is in marked contrast to the Chinese denunciations of the Dalai Lama as a “splittist.”

This puts the Karmapa in a singular position, said Robert J. Barnett, director of the Modern Tibetan Studies Program at .

“The Karmapa is perfectly placed to be someone who could broker a solution in the future,” Mr. Barnett said. “This is one of the rather rare issues where exiles and those in Tibet are in agreement. They have very wide respect for the Karmapa.”

Mr. Barnett likened the allegation that the Karmapa is a Chinese spy to the “birther controversy” involving President Obama, saying that to experts it has no legitimacy.

The rival Karmapa, Trinley Thaye Dorje, has the backing of one senior lama in the Kagyu tradition and some followers in the West (who managed to secure the rights to the Web address ). But Mr. Barnett said that while Tibetans are free to choose the teachers they prefer, most recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the true Karmapa.  “For most people, this is a settled issue,” he said.

Tenzin Chonyi, president of the Woodstock monastery (called Karma Triyana Dharmachakra), was an aide to the 16th Karmapa, and as a child fled Tibet with him in 1959. He said the 17th Karmapa was identified by a group of lamas who were entrusted with the task of finding the child who they believe is the reincarnation of the previous Karmapa.

“This Karmapa was found based on the previous Karmapa’s instruction,” Mr. Chonyi said. “So we have no doubt.”

In response to the Indian police investigation, Tibetans turned out by the thousands to demonstrate their support for the Karmapa. The Tibetan government in exile sent delegations to . The Indian police quickly cleared him.

Several months later, the Indian government gave him permission to travel to the , permission it had denied since his first trip to the United States in 2008.

Asked whether the suspicions had damaged relations between India and the Tibetans in exile there, the Karmapa took the long view.

“The connection between India and the Tibetan people is thousands of years old,” he said. “It is a spiritual connection and a cultural connection and is one of great affection. After all, the spiritual path of Buddhism, the spiritual path pursued by the majority of Tibetans, came from India to Tibet.”

He added, “This connection is one that has lasted generation after generation, and so I don’t think that this connection is in any danger.”

On his last trip to the United States, the Karmapa steered clear of politics. But this time, he did not mince words when asked about Tibet. He said Tibet was “in an emergency” that had only grown worse since the Chinese crackdown on the Tibetan demonstrations in 2008.

“The government of China has continued to be extremely restrictive,” by limiting the activities of monasteries and the number of monks, he said.

“The building of infrastructure — roads, trains, airports and so on — and the large of people from central China into Tibet threaten the survival of Tibetan culture and the ecosystem,” he said.

“It is a very good sign,” he said, that President Obama met with the Dalai Lama this month.

The Karmapa will speak at in on Friday night. He said he would talk about compassion — not politics — which his devotees say is really the calling of a reincarnate lama.

“You could say he’s in his 20s, and he’s 900 years old at the same time,” said Lama Kathy Wesley, a longtime American convert to Tibetan Buddhism and a board member at the Woodstock monastery. “The wisdom mind of the first Karmapa is said to continue in him.”
744 2011-07-29 HOUSTON — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed against Gov. Rick Perry of Texas by a national group of atheists seeking to block his participation in and promotion of a Christian-centered prayer rally next weekend.

The lawsuit, filed this month by the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, asked the judge to declare Mr. Perry’s involvement in the event unconstitutional. In a separate motion filed earlier this week, the group’s lawyers sought immediately to stop Mr. Perry, who is contemplating a presidential bid, from either taking part in the rally or promoting it in his official capacity as governor, arguing that doing so violates the First Amendment’s requirement of separation of church and state.

Judge Gray H. Miller, of Federal District Court in the Southern District of Texas, ruled that the plaintiffs — the foundation and five of its Houston-area members — had suffered no concrete injury and that the governor’s invitations for Texans to join him in a day of prayer were “requests, not commands.” People offended by the governor’s prayer rally can either not attend, not pray or express their disapproval using their First Amendment rights, the judge said. He dismissed the lawsuit and the motion to stop the governor’s official participation.

The judge’s ruling handed Mr. Perry a key legal victory in what has become one of the most controversial events of his political career in Texas.

Mr. Perry announced last month that he was inviting governors and people from across the country to join him on Aug. 6 in a day of prayer and fasting at Reliant Stadium in Houston to “seek God’s guidance and wisdom in addressing the challenges that face our communities, states and nation.” The event, called “The Response,” has been described by the governor’s aides as a nondenominational and apolitical Christian prayer meeting.
745 2011-07-29 LOS ANGELES — In a major victory for Marvel Entertainment and its parent, the Walt Disney Company, a federal judge in New York granted them summary judgment in their legal dispute with the heirs to the comic book artist Jack Kirby, while denying the Kirbys request for judgment against Disney and Marvel.

The ruling, by Judge Colleen McMahon of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, declares comics and characters created by Mr. Kirby — who helped give birth to the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men, all of which now underlie valuable movie series — were works for hire under the Copyright Act of 1909, and cannot be reclaimed by the Kirby family.

In 2009, Mr. Kirby’s heirs sent Marvel and Disney 45 notices of a plan to reclaim copyrights in a series of Marvel comics that were published from 1958 to 1963. The comics included issues of “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “The Avengers,” “Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos,” and others. In her ruling on Thursday, however, Judge McMahon said the notices “did not operate to convey any federally protected copyrights.”

Marc Toberoff, the Los Angeles lawyer who represents the Kirbys, said, “We knew when we took this on that it would not be an easy fight given the arcane and contradictory state of ‘work for hire’ ” case law under the 1909 Copyright Act. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling and intend to appeal this matter to the Second Circuit. Sometimes you have to lose to win.”

The court’s action helped lift a cloud that might have impaired Disney’s ability to work with some Marvel properties in the future. Disney bought Marvel for about $4 billion in 2009.

Recently, Marvel has had hit films in “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger,” both of which were released by Paramount Pictures, under an arrangement that predated the Disney acquisition. In May, Marvel is expected to release “The Avengers,” directed by Joss Whedon, with Robert Downey Jr. among its stars, through Disney.
746 2011-07-29 Meena Lee of South Korea overcame wet conditions and shot a seven-under 65 on Thursday for a two-stroke clubhouse lead in the first round of the Women’s British Open in Carnoustie, Scotland. She had seven birdies in a round played mainly in heavy rain.

Brittany Lincicome of the United States started her round early in better conditions and finished with a 67. The American Angela Stanford, South Korea’s Amy Yang, Germany’s Caroline Masson and Sweden’s Sofie Gustafson were among a group three shots behind the leader.

¶ Trevor Immelman shot a six-under-par 64 for a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Greenbrier Classic in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. Immelman, a former Masters champion, had seven birdies and a bogey on the redesigned Old White T.P.C. course for his best round of the year. Gary Woodland, Billy Mayfair, Derek Lamely, Webb Simpson and Steven Bowditch shot 65, and four others had a 66.

¶ Olin Browne had two eagles in a five-hole span and shot a seven-under 64 for a two-stroke lead after the opening round of the United States Senior Open at lengthy Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio.
747 2011-07-29 Mostly, though, he hung out in the East Village, where his apartment became a crash pad for Chinese friends passing through. The composer Tan Dun stayed there, as did the filmmaker Chen Kaige and the artist Xu Bing (who has an exhibition at the Morgan Library this summer).

The one thing Mr. Ai did consistently, and daily, was to take photographs wherever he went, the way tourists do, as Andy Warhol and Allen Ginsberg (an East Village neighbor) did too. Mr. Ai’s were just candid snapshots of this and that; nothing special. But he took thousands of them. The 227 examples in the Asia Society show — which originated at Three Shadows Photography Art Center in Beijing — represent a mere fraction of the total.

Still, arranged in chronological sequence, they give a vivid impression of his New York stay. They chart his gradual immersion into the city’s life and his awakening to the idea of art as social action.

Among the early pictures are a few sleepy, sullen-looking self-portraits and shots of his bare-bones apartment packed with Chinese friends. We also see him visiting museums. At the Museum of Modern Art he poses with work by two artist-heroes, Warhol and Marcel Duchamp.

And he was making various kinds of art himself: conceptual, ephemeral, trying-out sorts of things. For one piece, photographed in 1983, he bent a metal coat hanger into the shape of Duchamp’s profile, laid it down on his apartment floor and filled in its contours with sunflower seeds. In effect, he was creating a sketch, way in advance, for his 2010 Tate Modern installation, which consisted of thousands upon thousands of seeds cast in porcelain.

In the early photographs New York is mostly backdrop to images of young people having fun. But by 1987 the city starts to move into the foreground, with shots of homeless people and abandoned buildings. Mr. Ai had arrived near the peak of the East Village art boom. He stayed on as the economy tanked, and as a poor and working-class neighborhood gentrified. In 1988 warfare broke out.

The main battleground was Tompkins Square Park, where community activists, punk anarchists and the homeless repeatedly clashed with the police over use of the park. When a troop of park employees broke up a squatter encampment one day, the violence intensified. Mr. Ai was there in the middle of it, photographing everything. He sold some of the pictures to newspapers but gave most to the American Civil Liberties Union for use as evidence in their lawsuits against the police.

Just a few months later the pro-democracy movement in China was crushed. After the Tiananmen massacre Mr. Ai went on an eight-day hunger strike in protest. If his identity as an artist-activist didn’t exactly originate at this time — it was already there earlier in China — it certainly crystallized and gained force. He became fully who and what he was supposed to be.

The final pictures in the show are subdued. By the 1990s his friends are no longer the harum-scarum newcomers of 10 years earlier, bopping around town or camped out on floors. Tompkins Square Park has changed. It’s cleaned up and filled with elegant young summer picnickers. The show’s final shot, from 1993, is of an all-but-empty apartment. Mr. Ai moved back to China that year to be with his ailing father. The New York sojourn was over.

But not forgotten. He took the essence of it with him. Back in China he found himself cast in the role of adviser and exemplar to a group of radically experimental younger artists who lived in a wasteland area of Beijing that they dubbed East Village.

His own field of activities expanded hugely. But whatever work he did as the years went on — as an architect, a magazine publisher, an entrepreneur, an artist, a blogger — was in some way collaborative, interactive, socially directed.

And he never stopped taking photographs. During the past several years he routinely uploaded hundreds a day onto his Web site. Many of the images, like the blog entries and tweets they illustrated, were blatantly, heedlessly critical of China’s social realities and of its leaders. Outraged by the political negligence that resulted in the deaths of children in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Mr. Ai photographed shoddily built and flattened school buildings and interviewed distraught parents, posting everything on his Web site, which by then had an international following.

The earthquake was a public relations disaster for the Chinese government, which was doing everything possible to limit coverage in the news media. And here was this artist feeding on-the-ground truths out across the world.

Until that point Mr. Ai had operated within a kind bubble of protection, because of his father’s illustrious reputation within China and his own fame as an artist abroad. But with his persistent antigovernment blogging and tweeting, he finally went too far. He was taken into custody in April, held for nearly three months and released only conditionally.

It would not be wrong to call his Internet activity his most important art so far, his magnum opus. And it appears that it will continue in some form, which means that government pressure on him will be unrelenting. So should the vigilance of his supporters. And it is not too much to say — Mr. Ai has more or less said it — that the seeds for an art of social change, if not planted in New York, certainly took roots there. You see those roots growing in these coming-of-age photographs.
748 2011-07-29 As always happens when a company collapses, class-action suits were filed by suffering investors. They sued Lehman’s executives and its outside directors. They sued Ernst. They sued all the investment banks — 51 of them — that underwrote securities issued by Lehman.

As always happens, the defendants tried to get the suit thrown out before any evidence could be collected.

This week the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, refused to dismiss most of the suit. But Ernst came close to getting off entirely. The judge ruled that although there was evidence that Ernst should have done something differently in the final weeks of Lehman’s existence, there would be no trial on whether the firm’s audit of the 2007 financial statements was bad.

Lehman managed to hide as much as $50 billion of borrowing — and reduce its assets by the same amount — through something that has become immortalized as “Repo 105” transactions. Those transactions, completely hidden from investors while Lehman was heading to disaster, were disclosed last year in a blistering report by Lehman’s bankruptcy trustee. The fiddling did not affect profits, but it did make the company appear to be taking fewer risks than it was.

Judge Kaplan’s decision, it should be noted, was on a motion to dismiss and was not a finding that anyone had acted wrongly. In reaching his decision, he was required to assume that facts in the complaint were accurate and could be proven.

But the current state of class-action litigation makes the dismissal ruling very important. The law lets companies essentially tell the judge that “the plaintiff has no evidence we misbehaved, so you have to throw the case out before discovery lets the plaintiff find out if there is any evidence.” It is not unusual for a suit to be settled once a judge lets a case proceed.

At the heart of the Lehman case are repurchase agreements, commonly called repos, which are a common form of financing on Wall Street. The borrower “sells” securities for cash and agrees to repurchase them at a set price in a brief period.

Normally, repos are accounted for as borrowings, which is what they are. The borrower retains all the upside and downside of the securities in question. The lender gets an interest rate.

But Lehman found a loophole in an accounting rule, and concluded that if it put up $105 in collateral for every $100 borrowed, it could claim it really was a sale. At the end of each quarter, the company would decide just how much it needed to beautify its balance sheet, and would do repos to produce the desired result. They would be reversed a few days later.

The judge concluded that Lehman did not violate the accounting rule.

But, he added, “the fact that Lehman’s accounting for the Repo 105 transactions technically complied” with the rule “does not mean that Lehman’s financial statements complied with GAAP.”

Although companies hate it, that is the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in refusing to throw out the conviction of Bernie Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, said in 2006 that “GAAP itself recognizes that technical compliance with particular GAAP rules may lead to misleading financial statements, and imposes an overall requirement that the statements as a whole accurately reflect the financial status of the company.”

In the Lehman case, Judge Kaplan focused on the lack of evidence that Ernst had noticed what was going on.

“Allegations that a company violated GAAP in preparing financial statements are not sufficient, in and of themselves, to state a claim that an auditor’s opinion of GAAP compliance is a factual misstatement,” the judge wrote. Instead, there must be evidence that “the auditor did not actually hold the opinion it expressed or that it knew it had no reasonable basis for holding it.”

So even if Lehman is liable for violating GAAP, concluded Judge Kaplan, the question boils down to whether Ernst “knew enough about Lehman’s use of Repo 105s to ‘window-dress’ its period-end balance sheets to permit a finding that E&Y had no reasonable basis for believing that those balance sheets fairly presented” the company’s financial condition.

The bankruptcy trustee’s report, which basically is all the plaintiffs have to go on if they cannot obtain documents through discovery, quoted Ernst officials as saying that their review “applied only to the accounting basis for these transactions, not to their volume or purpose.” It quoted William Schlich, the Ernst partner in charge of the Lehman audit, as saying he did not know how many Repo 105 transactions Lehman had booked. “Ernst & Young,” the report stated, “did not evaluate the possibility that Repo 105 transactions were accounting-motivated transactions that lacked a business purpose.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a 2005 report by the office of the chief accountant, warned about such accounting-motivated transactions, saying any attempts “to portray the transactions differently from their substance do not operate in the interests of investors, and may be in violation of the securities laws.” But Ernst evidently was not interested, and that lack of interest is helping, not hurting, it in court.

Ernst did not get out of the case completely. The judge was impressed that Ernst failed to do much of anything after it interviewed a Lehman whistle-blower in June 2008. So while the 2007 audit is O.K., the judge thinks there can be a trial on the question of whether Ernst was guilty of misrepresentation when it signed off on Lehman’s report for the second quarter of 2008, saying it was “not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements.”

Ernst was relieved by the decision. “We are pleased that Judge Kaplan’s ruling dismisses most of the claims against us in this matter, and we strongly believe that we will ultimately prevail on the remaining claim,” said Charles Perkins, a spokesman for the firm. “As we have said consistently, we stand behind our work on the Lehman audit and our opinion that Lehman’s financial statements were fairly stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, applying the rules that existed at the time.”

Those rules, by the way, are changing, but not very rapidly. Starting in 2012, Repo 105 transactions will clearly have to be treated as borrowings under the new rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

In his ruling, Judge Kaplan said some of the auditing standards issued by the accounting oversight board were “couched in rather general and in some cases inherently subjective terms” that were subject to a wide range of interpretations. “More is necessary to make out a claim that the statement of opinion was false than a quarrel with whether these standards have been satisfied,” he wrote.

If the accounting oversight board’s standards are so vague as to be unenforceable, they need to be toughened.

You might wonder if the board has pursued a disciplinary case against Ernst or any of the Ernst auditors. There is no way to know. The law requires that such cases be kept secret, even after the board issues a ruling, until all appeals have been heard. The board has asked Congress to allow it to disclose investigations when it brings charges. As it is, the board says, auditors engage in delaying tactics to avoid negative publicity.

This case indicates that secrecy could save a firm money as well as reputation. Had the plaintiffs been able to point to an enforcement action, Judge Kaplan might well have allowed the claims over the 2007 audit to go to trial.
749 2011-07-29 SERANG, Indonesia — Twelve members of a mob that set upon adherents of an Islamic sect, killing three of them, received sentences of three to six months in jail on Thursday. Rights advocates criticized the ruling as an example of growing impunity for violence against religious minorities in Indonesia.

In a heavily guarded court in Banten Province in western Java, the 12 defendants were found guilty of taking part in a clash between a crowd of more than 1,000 villagers and a handful of members of Ahmadiyya, an Islamic sect that mainstream Muslim clerics here say is heretical. The attack took place in Cikeusik, a remote village, in February.

A video of the attack that was posted online afterward provoked outrage in Indonesia and abroad. It showed police officers standing by as the villagers descended on a house where a number of Ahmadis were staying, beating several men and mutilating the bodies of the dead.

Human rights groups have been critical of the apparent reluctance of law enforcement officials to punish members of the mob. Prosecutors did not pursue murder charges, instead charging the 12 with crimes like incitement, assault and torture. They sought sentences of five to seven months, and the judges in the case chose even lighter sentences, saying that the Ahmadiyya adherents had caused the episode.

By contrast, one of the Ahmadis is being prosecuted on charges of provoking the violence and could face a sentence of six years; prosecutors have not yet said whether they would seek the maximum sentence.

Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia consultant for Human Rights Watch, said he was not surprised by the verdict in the villagers’ trial. “This is happening over and over again: people who are attacking minorities, they don’t get serious punishments.”
750 2011-07-29 Bob Bradley was fired Thursday as coach of the United States national soccer team, the president of the United States Soccer Federation said in a statement.

No immediate replacement was named, though immediate speculation centered on familiar names like Jürgen Klinsmann, the former German star and national team coach, whom the United States previously courted.

After the United States reached the second round of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Bradley was rehired through the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. But the Americans were routed, 4-0, by Spain in a friendly in June and were swamped, 4-2, by Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final after losing a first-round match against Panama.

There seemed to be a growing feeling that the Americans had stagnated in their progression while the fast, young, creative Mexican team had surpassed the United States as the region’s top team.

Bradley had long been a polarizing figure. And fairly or unfairly, frequent criticisms of him began to resurface: he was too conservative and bland; he was too loyal to players like defender Jonathan Bornstein and his son, midfielder Michael Bradley; he coached a team that too often fell behind early and had to catch up using fitness and determination more than tactical awareness and technical skill.

“We want to thank Bob Bradley for his service and dedication to U.S. Soccer during the past five years,” Sunil Gulati, the president of the national federation, said in a statement. “During his time as the head coach of our men’s national team, he led the team to a number of accomplishments, but we felt now was the right time for us to make a change. It is always hard to make these decisions, especially when it involves someone we respect as much as Bob. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”
751 2011-07-29 “We’re looking to make meaningful changes in the contract, which reflect the state of the wireline business as well as the economy,” said Lawrence Marcus, Verizon’s senior vice president for labor relations. “The wireline business is basically fighting to reverse a 10-year decline in our profitability.”

Verizon is pressing its unionized workers to begin contributing to their health care premiums, proposing that workers pay $1,300 to $3,000 for family coverage, depending on the plan. The company says the contributions are similar to those made by its 135,000 nonunion employees.

Verizon also wants to make it easier to lay off workers without having to buy them out and wants to tie raises more closely to job performance, denying annual raises to subpar performers.

The company also has called for freezing pensions for current employees and eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, while making its 401(k) plans somewhat more generous for both groups. It would also like to limit sick days to five a year, as opposed to the current policy, which company officials say sets no limit.

“Verizon has put on the table the most aggressive set of contract demands we’ve ever seen,” said Robert Master, a spokesman for the communications workers. “From our perspective, this hugely profitable company that made $20 billion over the last four years, despite the worst economy in 75 years, seems determined to turn tens of thousands of secure middle-class jobs into lower-wage, much less secure jobs.”

The union has sought to put Verizon on the defensive, repeatedly highlighting that its top five executives received a total of $258 million, including stock options, over the last four years. The union is planning a big protest Saturday outside Verizon’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan.

“I’m not a financial wizard, but if you can afford to pay a C.E.O. millions a year, then how can you ask workers to slash their benefits?” said Paula M. Vinciguerra, president of the communications’ workers’ local on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “I was raised with the idea of shared sacrifice.”

Verizon said many field technicians earned $95,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. But union officials said the field technicians and call center workers generally earned $29 to $37 an hour, translating to $60,000 to $77,000 for a full-time worker, with benefits worth an additional $25,000 a year.

The Verizon contracts that expire at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 7 cover nearly 45,000 workers, from Massachusetts to Virginia, including thousands of Verizon employees in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. That union is holding a separate strike authorization vote.

Jim Spillane, a spokesman for the electrical workers, declined to comment on Verizon’s proposals or the contract talks.

The crux of the clash is Verizon’s financial health. The company says the wireline division is struggling, while the union says Verizon’s overall business is thriving.

Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said: “It’s hard to argue with Verizon’s basic premise that the wireline business is a troubled business. They are going to have to find ways to shrink that business to maintain any semblance of viability.”

Last year, Verizon’s wireline division trimmed its work force by buying out 11,900 workers. Its wireline operations — which include home phones and FiOS — had revenues of $41.2 billion last year, down 2.9 percent from the previous year. At Verizon Wireless, a joint venture with Vodafone Group, a British company, revenue was $63.4 billion, a 5.1 percent increase over the previous year.

Verizon reported that its wireline operating income was $606 million for the first six months of this year, compared with $9.0 billion at Verizon Wireless.

Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research company in Atlanta, said Verizon’s landline division had no competition until the last decade.

Verizon has lost business to wireless companies, to companies like Vonage and Skype and to cable television companies, many of them nonunion like Comcast and Time Warner, Mr. Kagan said. “When you have competition with companies that are not unionized, it’s a different world,” he said.
752 2011-07-29 “We are going into a world where finding the oil and gas is going to be more complex,” Shell’s chief executive, Peter R. Voser, acknowledged as his company released its results. “It needs more money.”

Smaller oil and gas companies like EOG Resources and Cabot Oil and Gas have proved to be more nimble than the giants in recent years, moving into shale oil and gas fields in the United States and booking new reserves at a far faster rate. The major companies have tried to follow suit over the last two years, but a glut of natural gas from rising production has weakened the profitability of some fields.

Growth in oil company profits for the rest of the year is uncertain, given that oil and gas prices are strongly tied to the health of the global economy. Demand in the United States for diesel, gasoline and other petroleum products has eased in recent months after starting the year strongly, and the growth in Chinese oil demand has slowed somewhat.

“If the economy does not grow faster, earnings growth in the energy sector is obviously going to be limited,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “You can’t grow energy demand in a flat economy.”

The Energy Department reported on Thursday that United States oil demand in May fell by nearly 2.5 percent from the same month the year before, representing a decline of 464,000 barrels a day. The department also reported that oil inventories last week were up by 2.3 million barrels from the week before, suggesting a less-than-robust summer driving season.

Oil prices have eased more than 10 percent since the spring, when crude prices peaked because of the loss of 1.3 million barrels of oil a day of production caused by the turmoil in Libya and fears that instability could spread to major producers like Saudi Arabia and Algeria. Since then, increased production in Saudi Arabia and the release of oil from strategic reserves in the United States and other industrialized countries have helped prevent shortages.

Even if oil demand and prices increase, large oil companies will strain to keep up production.

ConocoPhillips reported a 90,000-barrel-a-day decline in oil and gas production for the quarter on Wednesday, though earnings were higher anyway as a result of higher oil prices. Shell also reported a decline of 100,000 barrels of daily oil and gas production for the quarter, in part because of permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP accident last year.

Exxon’s earnings were lower than analysts had expected despite strong revenue growth, reflecting a record $10.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in new oil and gas projects, up 58 percent from the second quarter of 2010.

Exxon’s purchase of XTO Energy last year to become the nation’s biggest natural gas producer has been questioned by some investors in light of low gas prices, but the acquisition helped Exxon’s oil and gas production to increase by 10 percent from a year ago.

Exxon is continuing to invest heavily in natural gas, purchasing 317,000 acres for $1.7 billion in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale field in June. It is also drilling deep in the Gulf of Mexico, and last month announced the discovery of a new deepwater field holding the equivalent of 700 million barrels of oil.

Edward Westlake, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Exxon profits were hurt by the shutdown in production in several oil fields and refineries around the world for maintenance reasons. He said he was optimistic about the company’s prospects because of an increase of annual capital expenditures from $21 billion in 2007 to around $35 billion currently, along with its aggressive acquisition of oil and gas acreage.

While Exxon has tried to buy reserves, Shell has invested heavily over the last decade in complex projects, particularly in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. Its $20 billion Pearl project, which will produce liquid fuels out of natural gas on an enormous scale, has been going through final tests this year and should begin to produce profits in coming months.

For Shell, “earnings and cash flow should greatly improve over the next few years,” said Brian M. Youngberg, an oil analyst at Edward Jones.
753 2011-07-29 In a statement, Ms. Brooks confirmed that The News of the World had provided Mrs. Payne with a cellphone “for the last 11 years” as part of the campaign for the law, but said that “it was not a personal gift.” She said that she found the allegations that Mrs. Payne’s voice mail had been hacked “abhorrent and particularly upsetting, as Sara Payne is a dear friend.” In recent testimony on the scandal in Parliament, Ms. Brooks cited the measure named after Mrs. Payne’s daughter, Sarah’s Law, as evidence of the good she had done in her years at the tabloid’s helm.

Ms. Brooks was The News of the World’s editor during periods when hacking appeared to have been widespread, but has maintained she knew nothing of it. She stepped down July 15 from her executive role at News International, the British arm of ’s and the owner of The News of the World, and was later arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and payments to the police.

The company issued a brief statement on Thursday that said:  “News International takes this matter very seriously and is deeply concerned like everyone. As the facts are established, the Company and the independent Management and Standards Committee will take all appropriate actions, including cooperating fully with any potential criminal enquiries or civil proceedings which may arise.”

Scotland Yard officers told Mrs. Payne that details about her were among the papers held by the private investigator , according to the Phoenix Foundation statement. Mr. Mulcaire, who had an exclusive contract with the tabloid, had a list of about 4,000 potential targets and was convicted on hacking charges related to the paper five years ago.

The hacking scandal had been smoldering for years, but ignited in recent weeks after assertions that hacking on behalf of The News of the World had interfered with the investigation into the 2002 murder of a 13-year-old girl, . The man eventually convicted of her killing committed two more murders before he was caught.

More revelations appear imminent. Members of Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee said Thursday that they would gather this week to discuss whether to call further witnesses in their inquiries into the scandal and an alleged cover-up by News International. On Aug. 8, previously unseen documents relating to hacking from News International as well as a portion of Mr. Mulcaire’s documents held by the police will be released to those who have filed lawsuits.

On Aug. 10, the News Corporation — which has been bolstering its stock price with buybacks — will announce its quarterly results.

In central London on Thursday, the British judge leading the inquiry into the scandal held a news conference, saying that the panel planned to hold its first public hearings in September and that it would have the power to compel witnesses to testify.

An initial phase will focus on press regulation and the relationship between the press and the public, said the judge, Lord Justice Leveson. A second, which will begin after the current police investigation is finished, will focus on specific allegations of phone hacking and other journalistic malfeasance.

Justice Leveson was appointed by Prime Minister after it became clear that hacking at The News of the World extended not only to public figures like celebrities and politicians, but also to Milly Dowler and possibly to the families of those killed in terrorist attacks. Mr. Cameron, a Conservative, initially resisted setting up an immediate inquiry, but changed his mind in response to widespread public disgust and growing political pressure from the opposition Party.

One of the issues the judge will consider is the coziness of the ties between politicians and the news media — particularly the relationship between lawmakers and editors and executives at News International.

In another sign of how far in British public life News International’s influence extends — or has extended, until now — it emerged last week that Justice Leveson himself attended two parties last year at the home of Elisabeth Murdoch, a daughter of Mr. Murdoch’s, and her husband, Matthew Freud, a powerful public relations executive.

Justice Leveson said that because he and the rest of the inquiry panel — which includes former journalists and a former high-ranking police officer, among others — had been chosen for their experience, it was inevitable that “there are such contacts or links, and there should be no apology for this.”

He added: “Had I had the slightest doubt about my own position, I would not have accepted the appointment, and I also make it clear that I am satisfied that what the panelists have said creates no conflict of interest for them or me.”

In another development that might spell trouble for News International, Tim Godwin, the temporary chief of Scotland Yard, told a committee of lawmakers at that a new inquiry would most likely be opened into the 1987 ax murder of a private investigator.

The case has become newly relevant in light of revelations that Scotland Yard told Ms. Brooks in 2003 that it had evidence that one of her editors at The News of the World had hired people to conduct surveillance of the lead investigating police officer in the case. She was told that there was evidence that the surveillance was ordered as a favor to the chief suspects, Jonathan Rees and Sidney Fillary, investigators who had worked for the tabloid. Efforts to bring them to trial have fallen apart repeatedly.
754 2011-07-29 Eric Stiller, founder of Kayak Company, lost as much as $10,000 on what might otherwise have been the busiest week of the year. “That may not be a lot to ,” he said. “But it could not have been a more direct shot into the heart of our season.”

Even nonprofit groups lost income. At the Village Community Boathouse, which hosts free rows three times a week but relies on contributions, a donation barrel stood empty.

Customers also fled from businesses that barely dip a toe into the water. The Classic Harbor Line, which charters vintage boats for up to $1,200 an hour, fielded cancellations from clients including patients recovering from heart surgery, who worried about exposure, and groups that thought the Hudson no longer seemed classy.

“If you’re going out for a sunset sail and do something all elegant and sexy,” said Sarah Greer, the general manager, “you don’t want to hear ‘Watch out for the poop.’ ”

For businesses that helped shape the Hudson’s sunnier image, one question looms larger than lost dollars: Will the latest setback resuscitate old feelings?

Over 30 years ago, the Hudson was less a river than a landing spot where companies pumped sludge and the city discarded its sewage. Manna Jo Greene, of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, said onlookers knew what colors was painting its cars from the solvents swirling in the water in the upper Hudson. Dick DeBartolo, 66, said boaters back then could not see the bottom of their motors through the dark plumes. And as recently as 1997, an episode of “Seinfeld” lampooned the absurdity of a dip in a city river. (Kramer decided to dive in the East River when his local pool became too crowded.)

“Frankly the water was challenged back then; it was compromised,” said Morty Berger, founder of NYC Swim, which plans to host a swim below the on Saturday. “Those experiences have to be overcome.”

Spurred by long-term initiatives, like Gov. ’s $1 billion Pure Waters Bond Act of 1965 and the federal Clean Water Act of 1972, the river’s reputation has improved in recent years. Kayak and businesses have sprouted along Manhattan’s West Side. Renderings of future developments, like Brooklyn Bridge Park, often show boat slips and kayakers just off shore. Children’s camps include river adventures in many of their summer itineraries. More than 200 species of fish thrive in the Hudson. Turtles sun on rocks near the piers. Even seals have been spotted, some paddlers insist.

For residents old enough to remember the era of sludge, businesses fear that much of this progress may be discounted.

“It just reinforces those decades-old biases,” said Brent Beck, president of New York Outrigger, on 26th Street. “People are probably saying, ‘Is this really unusual?’ ”

Mr. Stiller, who founded Manhattan Kayak Company in 1995, said his greatest challenge, even before the fire, was persuading a skeptical public that the Hudson was fit for recreation.

“Any event like this sets us back conceptually,” Mr. Stiller added. “I don’t remember a time when it was this much of a freak-out.”

As if to prove it, he made a point of paddling his stand-up board out into the river on Wednesday, saying the sewage did not worry him. “Who’s going to go first if I don’t go first?” he said. “I’ve got to practice what I preach.”

In decades past, Mr. Berger of NYC Swim said, braving the murky waters “made you cooler.” Today, rigid quality standards have ensured that no children will frolic among the brown plumes.

Some paddlers mourn the old days.

“This is overkill,” said Frank Cervi, facilities manager at Village Community Boathouse. “You could just wash your hands, and you’re good to go.”

At Pier 40, an educational program’s day-to-day operations were perfectly normal. Almost.

Chris Anderson, the director of education at the program, the River Project, tried to stick to a “hands-on approach” to teach campers about life on the Hudson, with the added challenge of not allowing anyone to touch the water. Children patted horseshoe crabs, poked seahorses and carried water samples — all through the skin of rubber kitchen gloves.

A counselor walked up to Mr. Anderson with a box of gloves. “Do you know if these gloves are latex?” she asked. He wondered why it was important.
755 2011-07-29 The company, which is based in Kyoto, said it had sold just 710,000 units in the three months to June, bringing the total number of units sold to 4.32 million. Originally, the company said it had intended to sell that many devices in just the first weeks of introduction.

Nintendo’s earlier hand-held, the DS, started out with similarly sluggish sales. But a series of hit games that appealed to a broader audience — like Brain Age and Nintendogs — eventually led to runaway sales.

Still, the lackluster sales also reflect increasing competition for video game companies from new players that are redefining the industry.

Apple has sold more than 200 million devices like the iPhone and iPad that let users choose from tens of thousands of games to download for a few dollars, or at no charge. Smartphones that run Google’s Android operating system also run simple, downloadable games. Casual games played within social networks like Facebook have taken off, too, as membership of those networks grows.

The new crop of casual games has added to the traditional rivalry among gaming systems developed by the top three: Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.

Nintendo has dominated the last generation of consoles, and sold more than 147 million DS hand-held units and 87 million Wii home consoles. Sony is set to introduce a new portable game machine called the PlayStation Vita later this year, while Nintendo plans to sell a new home console in 2012.

But for now, players complain of a lack of games for the 3DS, a problem that plagues most new systems. Nintendo said Thursday that two flagship titles for the 3DS — Super Mario 3DLand and Mario Kart 7 — would go on sale in November and December. The releases are expected to improve sales of the device.

But unless more consumers start buying the 3DS soon, third-party developers could be discouraged from making games for it, leading to a vicious cycle of fewer games released and fewer 3DS units sold.

Nintendo is hoping that the steep price cut will help drive sales. The 3DS will cost 15,000 yen in Japan starting Aug. 11, down 40 percent from the original price of 25,000 yen, the company announced Thursday.

In the United States, the price will drop the next day to $169.99, from $249.99. The company said that it expected the price cut to help it meet a previous sales forecast of 16 million 3DS machines by the end of March.

To mollify current 3DS owners, the company said they would receive 20 free Nintendo downloadable games, including 10 that will be released only to those who bought a 3DS before the price drop.

In a letter posted online, Satoru Iwata, Nintendo’s president and chief executive, offered a profuse apology to Nintendo users, saying that lowering prices so soon after a game machine’s release was a painful move.

“Never in Nintendo’s history have we lowered prices to such an extent, less than half a year since the product launch,” Mr. Iwata said. “But we have judged that unless we move decisively now, there is a high possibility that we will not see many of our customers enjoying a Nintendo 3DS.”
756 2011-07-29 SEOUL, South Korea — Thousands of soldiers and police officers searched muddy wreckage and rain-swollen streams on Thursday for victims, survivors and explosives after floods and mudslides set off by torrential rain killed at least 59 people. Ten others were reported missing.

The Defense Ministry said soldiers were looking for several active land mines buried decades ago near an air defense unit on Mount Wumyeon in southern Seoul. Landslides tore away parts of the mountain, slamming through homes and killing 16 people.

In Yangju, a border town north of Seoul, soldiers have recovered most of the land mines and other ammunition lost in a landslide that damaged an army depot. But they were still looking for an undisclosed number of explosives. Several North Korean land mines, apparently swept away by floodwaters, have been found in streams near the border in recent weeks.

Across the country, 76 small and large landslides have been reported since Wednesday, according to the National Emergency Management Agency. The agency provided two death tolls. It counted 51 people whose deaths it believed were caused directly by landslides and flooding. The death toll was increased to 59 when the agency included people who went swimming while drunk and drowned, the agency said.

At a mountainside resort village in Chuncheon, 60 miles east of Seoul, university students running a volunteer summer camp for local children were asleep when a landslide engulfed their lodgings around midnight Tuesday.

763 2011-07-30 The lawyers for Roger Clemens have asked a federal judge to dismiss the charges against him, accusing the prosecutors at Clemens’s perjury trial earlier this month of sabotaging the government’s case to elicit a mistrial because the proceedings were going badly for them.

In court papers filed Friday in United States District Court in Washington, the defense also argued that a new trial for Clemens was unconstitutional because double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime — would apply. A second trial would unfairly subject Clemens to even more embarrassment, expense and anxiety, his lawyers wrote.

“The Government had its day in Court and squandered it with misconduct that irretrievably wasted time, money, and the opportunity for a one-time fair resolution of these charges for all involved,” the filing said.

Clemens’s perjury trial was halted in its second day of testimony on July 14 because of a glaring error by prosecutors. Now his fate is unclear. He faces charges of perjury, making false statements and obstruction of Congress related to his 2008 assertions to a Congressional committee that he never used steroids or human growth hormone.

At hearing on Sept. 2, United States District Judge Reggie Walton will discuss the possibility of a retrial with both sides. Prosecutors had presented jurors with testimony from Laura Pettitte — the wife of Andy Pettitte, Clemens’s former teammate and best friend — after the judge had barred that testimony from the trial a week before. He said it was hearsay.

The defense said the 11th-hour exclusion of that testimony was one reason the prosecutors had goaded the judge to declare a mistrial or the defense to ask for one. The prosecutors needed time to retool their case, Clemens’s lawyers said.
764 2011-07-30 The Pakistani Taliban have custody of two kidnapped Swiss tourists and will free them if the United States releases a Pakistani woman convicted of trying to kill Americans, a commander of the group said. The tourists, who have not been identified, were abducted in the southwestern Baluchistan Province this month and later taken to South Waziristan, a base of the Pakistani Taliban, the authorities said. The commander, Waliur Rehman, said Thursday that his group had ordered the kidnapping to try to gain the freedom of Aafia Siddiqui, an American-educated neuroscientist serving an 86-year prison term for trying to shoot United States security officials in Afghanistan.
765 2011-07-30 The prospect of county bankruptcy, which would be the largest of its kind in United States history, has gone from being an unwelcome mark of distinction to something that many residents insist should have happened a long time ago.

It still stings to think about how things got this way, how county residents are stuck with the tab from a reckless binge by Wall Street bankers, middlemen and crooked politicians, a greed-fueled spree that none of the voters actually wanted or even knew was happening. But residents know that complaints about fairness have not made that debt, all $3.2 billion of it, go away.

“What are you going to do?” said Steve Mordecai, 50, who was eating lunch at Ted’s, a meat-and-three place here that is somewhat less crowded than usual on Fridays, given that so many county employees are no longer working. “The county created the mess,” Mr. Mordecai said. “Now we have to pay it back.”

The story that ends in overspending excess began in neglect: in 1996, the federal government accused Jefferson County of sending raw sewage into area rivers and demanded that it rebuild its dilapidated sewer system. Such a project would be costly, but officials hoped to avoid unpopular rate increases first by pushing that cost into the future, and then by adding a maze of derivatives that were supposed to shield the county from interest-rate increases.

But the bond deals were fraught with pay-to-play scandals. Four county commissioners were convicted of taking bond-related bribes. Two bankers are fighting federal accusations that they made secret payments, and in 2009 J.P. Morgan forfeited $752 million to settle a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The complicated bond-and-derivative structures failed during the financial turmoil of 2008, leaving the county with a $3.2 billion debt to pay, faster than planned. Sewer revenues that were pledged to pay the debt cannot keep up. The problems keep compounding: federal prosecutors have taken a derivatives consultant to court on bid-rigging charges. And the Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether the sewer bonds really should have been marketed as tax exempt.

But the fiscal crisis went from a simmer to a full boil in April, when the Alabama Supreme Court declared a major county tax unconstitutional. Shortly afterward, with the county reeling from the severe shortfall in general funds, a court-appointed receiver recommended a steep increase in county sewer rates, and also laid claim to the county’s only cash reserves, saying they were needed to bolster the sewer system’s finances.

At the end of June, Gov. Robert Bentley declared a shaky truce while negotiations took place. On Thursday, the County Commission announced that it was entering a seven-day standstill period to consider a settlement offer from the creditors, an announcement that was met with grumbles across most of the county.

“They should have filed for bankruptcy 10 years ago,” said Howard Faulk, an owner of Sophie’s Deli across the street from the county courthouse, where the lines for county business are hours long but the parking is free because the county cannot afford parking attendants. “If you’re standing in water this deep,” Mr. Faulk asked, his hand at his neck, how much deeper can it get?

But any residents who think a bankruptcy will simply wipe the debt clean are probably in for a bleak surprise. Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, the one local governments use, does not work like Chapter 11, where corporations restructure and bondholders routinely suffer losses.

In fact, Chapter 9 was amended in 1988 with the specific goal of making clear that certain types of municipal bonds would keep on paying even in bankruptcy, said James E. Spiotto, a bankruptcy specialist with the firm of Chapman Cutler. The bonds issued to finance Jefferson County’s giant sewer project are this type.

“The whole purpose is to assure the market that in times of distress, the bonds will be paid,” Mr. Spiotto said in an interview.

Many citizens of the county speak bitterly of a perception that other parts of Alabama think of the county as unworthy of help. Even one of the county’s own state senators blocked a plan to allow Jefferson to raise revenue to replace some of what was taken away by the April court decision, thus forcing layoffs.

“In Alabama, Jefferson County is Chinatown,” said David Mowery, a Montgomery political consultant, using the metaphor for hopeless inscrutability from the Roman Polanski film of the same name. “Forget it,” he said, summing up the general attitude toward the county. “There’s nothing you can do about it.”

But as Alabama’s own governor learned over the spring and summer, you cannot just forget Jefferson County, where Birmingham is the county seat. If it goes down, it takes the state — and the state’s credit — with it. This realization prompted the governor to intervene when the county was near declaring bankruptcy at the end of June.

Still, little of this reassures the people slogging through here, who realize that life will get harder before it gets better. The only consolation is gallows humor and signs they might not be alone.

“I used to think what awful leadership we have in Jefferson County,” said Phillip Winette, 58, who runs a printing company. “But now I’m watching the debate on a national level. It’s an epidemic.”
766 2011-07-30 Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, had a 43 percent jump in quarterly profit, beating estimates as high oil prices and increased refinery margins offset weaker output.

The numbers released on Friday were the latest in a string of huge profits from the industry, which got a lift from the highest oil prices in nearly three years. Exxon Mobil, the country’s largest oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell earlier in the week reported profits that also benefited from acquisitions and shifts into new projects.

Chevron’s profit rose to $7.7 billion, or $3.85 a share, from $5.4 billion, or $2.70 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $3.56 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 30 percent to $69 billion.

Chevron reported 2.69 million barrels per day of oil-equivalent output, compared with 2.75 million a year-ago.

Chevron trimmed its 2011 production forecast to 2.76 million barrels per day because of a slower acceleration of its Perdido project in the Gulf of Mexico and a pipeline problem in Thailand. Chevron had strived for 2.79 million barrels per day, or 1 percent growth.
767 2011-07-30 The Omidyar Network, through which Mr. Omidyar supports both commercial and nonprofit ventures, found that charities set goals that often did not match their employees’ skill sets, lacked succession planning and were led by executives stretched too thin.

In 2006, Mr. Lewis set up a nonprofit called the Management Center to provide human resources and other consulting services to groups to which he and others donated.

He has tangled with prominent organizations like Case Western Reserve University and the Guggenheim Museum over what he considers bad management, but he said he had intended the Management Center to work primarily with the fledgling progressive groups he was underwriting then. “They weren’t so interested, so I finally had to say, ‘I won’t give you any more money until you learn this stuff,’ ” Mr. Lewis said. “I don’t have that kind of leverage with the Guggenheim and those big organizations.”

Nonprofit leaders are notoriously prickly about allowing major donors to get involved in how they manage their organizations, but officials of groups that have used the services provided by Mr. Lewis and Mr. Omidyar say they were enormously beneficial.

“Many donors say they provide value beyond financial resources, but in reality that’s quite rare,” said Tim Hanstad, chief executive of Landesa, which works to ensure land rights to the rural poor. “But frankly, I could easily make the case that the nonfinancial resources we got from Omidyar were as equally beneficial as the money they gave us.”

Landesa received executive coaching, advice on a compensation structure and help in recruiting three senior executives.

Mr. Omidyar’s background as a young entrepreneur struggling to manage eBay’s explosive growth provided him with experience he wanted to pass on as he became a philanthropist.

So after establishing the Omidyar Network, he hired Sal Giambanco, an executive who oversaw human resources at eBay and PayPal. Mr. Giambanco and his team have worked with 47 nonprofits, more than half the network’s charitable portfolio. “The dynamics of a Silicon Valley start-up are not that different from a nonprofit — both tend to have charismatic founders, both are more passionate about what they’re doing than about how they’re going about doing it, both tend to be organizationally flat,” Mr. Giambanco said.

When Linda Rottenberg, a founder of Endeavor Global Inc., a nonprofit that supports budding entrepreneurs in developing countries, began working with the network, her organization needed to lower its reliance on donations and expand a management team to cope with its growth. Additionally, Ms. Rottenberg’s husband, the author Bruce Feiler, had cancer, and they had young twins.

Omidyar put up $10 million to help Endeavor grow, but required the organization to meet stiff matching requirements for about $4 million of the gift.

Perhaps more onerous was the network’s insistence that Ms. Rottenberg undergo executive coaching. “If I hadn’t been going through what I was going through personally at the time, I might have pushed back on that more,” she said. “I did think, ‘Why do they need to put me on the couch?’ ”

She now praises that aspect. Mr. Giambanco gave her practical advice that she said had proven valuable. “We had been a very flat organization, where everyone had access to me, and now there was going to be this cabinet of senior managers to deal with and other changes he helped me figure out how to explain and manage,” she said.

Omidyar also helped her recruit a management team with experience at companies like Dell, Bloomberg and AOL. “We don’t always agree with them,” Ms. Rottenberg said, referring to the network. “We don’t kowtow. But the services they are offering are really useful, especially at organizations like us where resources are always scarce.”

Mr. Lewis continues to support the Management Center, though groups receiving advice have begun to pay for the help.

“People in this sector, just like scientists and doctors, get promoted because of their issue expertise and then no one really ever teaches them how to manage,” said Jerry Hauser, the center’s chief executive and a former consultant at McKinsey & Company. “Then it becomes a vicious cycle, where the next generation coming up in an organization comes up under someone who doesn’t know how to manage.”

David S. Bennahum, the chief executive of the nonprofit investigative news operation, the American Independent News Network, credits the center with finding a way to manage a workload that had rapidly expanded.

“For the first time, we created quarterly goals for the whole organization,” he said. “We had 58 impact stories last year, stories that had real consequences in communities around the country, and it wasn’t just by accident — we worked toward that goal.”
768 2011-07-30 Caroline Masson of Germany shot a seven-under 65 to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Women’s British Open on Friday. Masson, 22, had seven birdies without a bogey on the Carnoustie Golf Links to move to 11-under 133, one stroke ahead of South Korea’s Inbee Park and Meena Lee. Park had nine birdies in a 64, while Lee, who started the second round of the major with a two-stroke lead, closed with two birdies in a 69. The defending champion, Yani Tseng, was four strokes back after a 66.

¶ Olin Browne retained his United States Senior Open lead with a 69 in Toledo, Ohio. He leads Mark O’Meara by a shot.

¶ Darren Clarke failed to make the cut at the Irish Open in Killarney, two weeks after he won the British Open for his first major title. Marcel Siem eagled the 16th hole and took the second-round lead at 10-under 132. Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell looked in danger of following Clarke out of the tournament. But McIlroy made three straight birdies from Nos. 14 to 16 to finish at 68. McDowell birdied his first two holes in a 66.

¶ Brendon de Jonge and Webb Simpson share the lead halfway at the Greenbrier Classic in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. De Jonge shot a three-under-par 67 and Simpson a 68. They are seven under.

770 2011-07-30 “My son said, ‘I always thought it was just a dream,’ ” he said.

But as I found out, such dreams cost a lot of money to keep going. The land may be appreciating in value but the continuing costs are substantial. James H. Taylor, managing partner at Hall & Hall, a broker that specializes in ranches, said some of the return had to come from being there. “It doesn’t make sense to own a ranch if you’re not going to come out and use it,” he said.

Ranches have always had a spot in a wealthy investor’s portfolio. Ted Turner may be known for founding CNN, but he also began buying ranches in 1987 and is now the second-largest individual landowner in North America, with two million acres spread across seven states, trailing only John Malone of Liberty Media. He sells the bison he raises, some to Ted’s Montana Grill, his restaurant chain.

As a pure investment, Mr. Taylor said, agricultural land has long offered steady returns, particularly as food prices have risen. According to the Farmland Index produced by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, prices rose 8.6 percent last year and 6.19 percent in 2009.

But he categorizes farmland as the least fun type of land to own. The types of land he considers more fun — working ranches and private or dude ranches — have lower returns.

“Most people consider this a safe place to park your money,” Mr. Taylor said. “The alternatives are savings accounts, triple-A rated securities and government bonds.”

Depending on how someone buys and sells a ranch, there are special tax treatments for what the Internal Revenue Service calls like-kind exchanges, which can defer capital gains taxes, said Brian R. Gallagher, a tax partner at the law firm Davis & Gilbert. (The same rule, known as 1031, can apply to other real estate transactions where the properties are owned as investments.)

Warren Burke, a lifelong rancher, said he bought his first ranch, 600 acres in Pinedale, Wyo., with $1,500 down in 1971. He traded three ranches, including one in Montana now owned by Tom Brokaw, the retired NBC news anchor, until he acquired the 8,000-acre EA Ranch in Dubois, Wyo., in 1989 for $1.4 million. Last October, he sold it for $7 million and traded down to a 1,000-acre ranch. He did not pay tax until he downsized.

“My whole deal was I was never in it for the profit,” he said. “I was in it for the lifestyle, trying to make it work and enjoying the work.”

He added, “Cattle are a business; the ranch is an investment.”

That is something would-be buyers should remember. These vast tracts of land are gorgeous and can increase substantially in value, but they can be difficult to sell or even value.

Some of them have no comparable listings. Take the Darwin Ranch in Wyoming. It consists of 160 deeded acres in a valley but is surrounded by the Gros Ventre Wilderness area. While it is completely private, it is accessible only in the warm months, by road or air.

“We don’t know what it’s worth,” said Loring Woodman, who bought it for $70,000 in 1964 after graduating from Harvard and has run it since as a guest ranch.

He said the ranch was sold in August 2008 for $8.5 million, but the buyer pulled out when Lehman Brothers collapsed. The ranch is now set for auction in September, with a minimum price of $4.5 million.

While these profits are eye-popping, those who buy a ranch and think they can just call it a business may be in trouble. The I.R.S. has a hobby-loss rule to keep gentleman farmers from gaming the system.

“If you buy a farm, throw some cows on it and you’re a major executive in New York City, you have to be careful,” Mr. Gallagher, the tax lawyer, said.

He said a ranch needed to make a profit, or at least have tried to make a profit, for three of the last five years to be in compliance. (The rules for ranches that breed horses are more lenient, with a profit for two out of seven years.)

There are now emerging markets beyond livestock and guest ranches. Brian Bean, an investment banker who runs the Copper Creek Capital Group in Point Reyes Station, Calif., owns Lava Lake Land and Livestock in Idaho. The ranch, which stretches over 900,000 acres, has become known for its grass-fed lamb and the quality of its wool.

But Mr. Bean said he was considering a host of ancillary businesses. One would be to enter the market for carbon trading, when a more robust one emerges in the United States. He estimates that he has 700,000 tons of carbon trapped in the land that would have a value for companies that need to offset the carbon they emit.

Another area is mitigation banking, where, for example, a state’s department of transportation could buy acres to be preserved forever to compensate for having destroyed land elsewhere.

“The process is not, ‘Should you build the interchange’ but ‘What do you do now that you’ve wiped out five acres of wetlands?’ ” Mr. Bean said. “These acres could be worth $10,000 to $20,000 when they would be worth $2,000 to $4,000 in a nonmitigation environment.”

Still, ranches are one area where money-making plans do not always pan out. Johannes von Trapp, a member of the family that inspired “The Sound of Music,” learned this with his first ranch. He said he figured that the indigenous people on his land in British Columbia would help work it for him in the summer.

“It turns out they go salmon fishing 100 miles away,” Mr. von Trapp said. “That’s a good example of the assumptions one makes when one buys land a long ways away and doesn’t understand all the complexities.”

Things have worked out better for him at the Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont, which today has 2,500 lush, mountainous acres. But even he has escapist fantasies of heading out West.

“My most recent guests were very annoyed because I didn’t have a water park,” he said. “Swimming in the creek wasn’t good enough for them.”
771 2011-07-30 The broader market as measured by the S.&P. ended the week down about 3.9 percent, its largest weekly loss in more than a year. It also recorded its third consecutive monthly loss. The last time the broader market closed lower for three straight months was in 2008, for the months of September, October and November.

Commerce Department revisions to earlier G.D.P. figures suggested that the recovery was weaker than initial estimates had let on. Consumer spending, accounting for about 70 percent of G.D.P., was virtually unchanged in the second quarter.

Stephen Wood, Russell Investments’ chief market strategist, noted that many economists had expected a slow second quarter, for reasons including severe weather and the supply chain disruptions that followed the earthquake in Japan.

But changes to the G.D.P. estimates for the first quarter and the quarters before it weighed especially heavily on sentiment.

“We were clearly looking at a second-quarter slow patch,” he said. “The revision to Q1 caught the market by surprise.”

The lack of a strong recovery highlights the difficulties Congress is facing in its deadlocked deliberations to raise the debt ceiling for the American government because some businesses are delaying decisions amid the uncertainty. A recovery in the job market and consumer spending is seen as crucial in stimulating the pace of the economy.

While it was another day of selling, investors had few alternatives for their money.

“The debt ceiling debate, if you can call it that, is an ongoing drama,” Mr. Wood said. “Where do you go given that Treasuries are in the teeth of the debt ceiling negotiations? This is uncharted waters.”

Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, described the G.D.P. report as “roundly disappointing.”

He also said that the stalemate in the debate in Congress was having an impact on the markets.

“The Treasury market is trading higher this morning as yet another day goes by without a viable plan for resolving the debt ceiling impasse,” said Mr. Giddis in an early commentary, referring to prices.

As Treasury prices rose, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell sharply to 2.79 percent in late afternoon trading, compared with 2.96 percent late Thursday.

Lawmakers have to reach a deal by Aug. 2 or the government might face a shortfall and be unable to meet its financial obligations.

Declines in European markets steepened after the G.D.P. report was released in the United States. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.99 percent to 5,815.19, the DAX in Frankfurt was down 0.44 percent to 7,158.77 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.07 percent to 3,672.77. The euro rose to $1.439.

777 2011-07-31 Exclusive analysis: Barnes & Noble talks likely to lead to latest in long line of bold Apple non-mergers and un-acquisitions!

And so it begins again. BGR has an exclusive scoop from an “unproven” (ooh!) source: Apple is in talks to buy Barnes & Noble, the country’s last remaining national bookseller. As BGR points out, the acquisition would get Apple B&N’s digital books and other publications (which it might conceivably want) and Nook hardware (which it surely doesn’t), along with hundreds of retail outlets which it could either shutter or convert into Apple Stores. (Enormous Apple Stores! Usually located conveniently close to existing Apple Stores!)

Here’s a bit of deep insight from another BGR source (the story doesn’t say if it’s a proven or unproven one):

Well said. For years, Apple has confounded the rest of us by not buying things that it should clearly be buying. Not purchasing other well-known companies is so core to Apple’s strategy that it must have a whole department devoted to non-mergers and un-acquisitions.

We’ve been over this before, but it’s worth a recap:

2003: Apple shows it’s not that serious about this music thing after all when it doesn’t buy Universal Music!

2004: The world wonders if Steve Jobs has lost all common sense when Apple doesn’t buy Pixar, a company Jobs already runs!

2005: Industry watchers the world over do a double-take in unison when Apple doesn’t buy TiVo!

2006: Apple tips its hand to its disinterest in the phone market by making a strategic decision not to buy Palm!

2006: It makes no sense at all, but Steve Jobs’ large ownership stake in a legendary Hollywood company doesn’t lead to Apple buying Disney!

782 2011-07-31 “It’s not an intentional delay; it’s a bureaucratic mess,” said Carlos Spector, Mr. Gutiérrez’s El Paso lawyer. “The system mitigates against the delivery of justice because these asylum cases are complicated.”

Mr. Spector estimates he will need at least 20 hours before the judge to present witnesses on behalf of Mr. Gutiérrez. He has also filed a petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that the Mexican government falls short in its ability to protect its citizens from the military.

To win political asylum, foreign nationals must prove to a judge that they have been persecuted in the past or have a well-founded fear of persecution in the future based on five specific statutory grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. About 33,000 people applied for political asylum in the United States in fiscal year 2010, according to the Executive Office of Immigration Review; Texas handled about 800 of those cases.

Mr. Gutiérrez was detained for seven months because he lacked permission to enter the United States, but he is now living in a location he prefers not to disclose for security reasons (his son was detained for two months before being released).

Why there are such stark differences among immigration judges is unclear. The Syracuse study has tracked political asylum decisions since 1994 and has called the disparities “disturbing,” noting that “the unusual persistence of these disparities — no matter how the asylum cases are examined — indicates that the identity of the judge who handles a particular matter often is more important than the underlying facts.”

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the United States Department of Justice, oversees one part of the political asylum process and appoints the immigration judges. Officials there did not respond to a request for comment on the Syracuse study or on Mr. Gutiérrez’s case.

Mr. Spector, who for more than 20 years has represented asylum seekers, believes that those from Mexico face a higher threshold because the United States has a significant financial and political interest in supporting the Mexican government in its struggle with narcotics traffickers and drug cartels.

“There is a political predisposition by the judges to deny Mexican asylum claims for political and policy reasons,” Mr. Spector said. And because immigration judges “have been government employees for so long, they get the memo,” he said, adding that immigration judges are often recruited from the ranks of prosecutors or law enforcement.

Dana Leigh Marks, an immigration judge in California and the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, says it is not so simple, although she does agree that foreign policy interests are a factor in political asylum decisions.

“Immigration judges are required to consult and incorporate in their decisions the official country report published by the United States Department of State in any asylum case,” she said. “Obviously our foreign relations position with regard to a country from which the asylum seeker comes is an important factor in the judge’s decision.”

The State Department’s 2010 country report on Mexico catalogs a long list of human rights abuses, in addition to the widespread violence caused by the cartels and the drug trade generally: “unlawful killings by security forces; kidnappings; physical abuse; poor and overcrowded prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency that engendered impunity within the judicial system; confessions coerced through torture; violence and threats against journalists leading to self-censorship.”

Because Mr. Gutiérrez, who wrote for an affiliate of El Diario de Juárez, was documenting crimes allegedly committed by Mexican military personnel and there is no evidence those people have been brought to justice, he and Mr. Spector argue that he meets the criteria for political asylum.

Jacqueline L. Watson, an immigration lawyer in Austin, says it is always a gamble to think a case is solid enough to convince a judge. She says it is difficult to convince judges that there is an imminent threat to life or liberty.

“Unfortunately it’s almost like they left too soon,” she said. “It is as if one can say, ‘Oh yeah, congratulations, you saved your life but you didn’t stick around long enough to almost be killed and live to tell about it.’ ”

One potential bright spot for Mr. Gutiérrez is that he has legal representation. According to the Syracuse analysis, almost 90 percent of those seeking political asylum who were not represented by a lawyer were denied.

As he waits, Mr. Gutiérrez remains optimistic he will be given asylum. He also scoffs at analysts who say the security situation in Mexico is exaggerated or even improving.

“Tell them to go live in Juárez to see if it’s getting better,” he said. “They need to live there.”
783 2011-07-31 Three MGM lions on a building on Hyde Street in today’s seamy Tenderloin district are a reminder of a bit of Hollywood history. From the 1930s to the 1960s, the area was home to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century-Fox, Paramount, Columbia and other Hollywood studios, which set up film distribution centers along Hyde Street between Golden Gate and Eddy.

The business of buying films in bulk and renting them to movie houses — a system invented in 1903 by Harry, Herbert and Earle C. Miles, brothers from San Francisco — transformed the industry. Before appearing on Hyde Street, the first distribution centers were on Market Street.

Art Deco, a style associated with Old Hollywood that used geometrical flourishes like zigzags, curves and swirls, favored the use of precast molds, like the lions atop the building at 259 Hyde Street, once the film exchange for MGM and now home to an S.R.O. tenant advocacy group. The film exchange for 20th Century-Fox was at 245 Hyde Street; the building’s upper corners still feature bas-relief comedy-tragedy masks.

The stepped parapet at the former film exchange at 125 Hyde Street is classic Deco design. The words “Motion Picture Studio and Laboratory” appear on the front of the building, now occupied by the Beverly Hills Playhouse Acting School and a designer.

In 1969, the 20th Century-Fox film exchange at 245 Hyde Street was sold and became Wally Heider Recording, where Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and other big-name acts of the ’60s and ’70s recorded. It is now Hyde Street Studios.

Film exchanges had elaborate vaults with sprinklers and ventilation systems to store the nitrate-based film stock, which is highly flammable. The vaults at 125 Hyde, the only ones from the area still in existence, now store props and supplies from the Beverly Hills Playhouse Acting School.

Movie theaters frequently caught fire because of the flammable stock until acetate-base film stocks, called safety films, came into common use in the early 1950s.
784 2011-07-31 The Iraq war, thankfully, is nearly over for this country. Not so for thousands of Iraqis who have worked with American troops and diplomats since the 2003 invasion as interpreters, drivers and fixers. They have long been targeted by militants. As American troops depart — the last are due to leave the country by the end of December — they are increasingly on their own.

At least 62,000 Iraqis (29,000 who worked for the Americans, and family members) have applications pending to enter the United States, according to the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project, which represents some of them. Visa approval is taking at least eight months. This country has a moral obligation to act on these cases urgently.

A lumbering application review process has been made even more difficult as the administration has imposed additional security checks on all visa applicants. Iraqis, including those who worked for the Americans, came under greater scrutiny after two Iraqis living in Kentucky were charged with providing arms and money to Al Qaeda in Iraq.

The men, arrested in May, were permitted to enter the United States legally in 2008 under the normal refugee program, even though at least one of them was later found to have been an insurgent in Iraq.

The solution is not to admit fewer refugees, as Senator Rand Paul argues. The United States has a responsibility to rigorously screen visa applicants and ensure they are not terrorists. But the process needs to be more transparent and accountable — and it needs to be expedited.

It took a long time for Washington to acknowledge its responsibility to its Iraqi employees, but in 2008 Congress authorized 5,000 special visas annually. Only 3,100 have managed to come here since then, in large part because the security vetting is so cumbersome.
785 2011-07-31 “I played awesome,” she said. “I’m so excited about tomorrow.”

Tseng acknowledged that she had never heard of Masson, who will be her playing partner on the final day.

“When she led last night, I had to ask my caddie, ‘Who’s that?’ ” Tseng said. “But it shows how many good players there are around these days.

“But I feel very comfortable and confident. I’ve learned a lot from the last three years, from my wins and my mistakes, and I’ll take that experience into tomorrow.”

Matthew thrilled the home crowd with her share of third place. The Open winner at Royal Lytham and St Annes two years ago, she also knows how to win at Carnoustie. Twenty years ago, at age 21, Matthew won the Scottish Amateur Championship on the course.

“It helps that I know the course, but I think Yani and Caroline feel pretty happy here now too,” she said.

Na Yeon Choi of Korea is alone in fifth on 208 after a 72. Brittany Lang, Sophie Gustafson and Se Re Pak share sixth place, a shot further back.

The American challenge never materialized. Lang (69) rose from a share of 18th place but is one stroke worse off than at the start of the day. Paula Creamer (71) is at six under, and Brittany Lincicome (76) is 13 shots back.

The first-round leader Meena Lee, tied for second after 36 holes, fell out of contention with an 80.

TWO-MAN RACE AT SENIOR OPEN Olin Browne fought off the heat to shoot a six-under 65 and take a two-shot lead over Mark O’Meara after the third round of the United States Senior Open in Toledo, Ohio. Browne, winless in three years on the senior tour, set the tournament record for lowest score through 54 holes. He is at 15-under 198.

O’Meara had a 66 in a head-to-head duel. He pulled even with a birdie at the ninth hole before Browne had five birdies on the difficult back nine. They will resume their head-to-head duel Sunday; their closest pursuers — Jeff Sluman (65), Peter Senior (68), Joey Sindelar (69) and Mark Calcavecchia (69) — are six shots off the pace.

Browne said he did not want to contemplate what winning a major championship would mean to him. “It would be great, obviously,” he said. “Any time you can put that kind of a championship on your résumé it’s a tremendous accomplishment. I haven’t gotten one. I would love to have one.” (AP)

SETBACK FOR MCILROY David Howell, Richard Green and Simon Dyson are in a three-way tie at the Irish Open, but the homegrown stars Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell fell out of contention with 72s during a wet, windy third round in Killarney. McIlroy had a terrible start, double-bogeying the first and eighth holes. He also bogeyed the par-3 third after his windblown tee shot sailed left into a stream. He is eight shots behind.

Howell, of England, shot a seven-under 64 for the best score of the day, and Dyson, of England, and Green, of Australia, shot 67. Stephen Gallacher of Scotland also shot a 68 and was two shots behind the leaders. (AP)
786 2011-07-31 Weak demand leads to slow growth, and slow growth leads to high and rising unemployment, which then reinforces weak demand and slow growth, and so on, in a vicious cycle from which the economy, obviously, has found no escape.

It is a situation that cries out for help from the government, and yet the opposite is happening. As federal stimulus programs from 2009 have ended — including aid to states and infrastructure projects — state and local governments have also cut back, leading to layoffs and less spending on contractors and social programs. The fiscal drag will only intensify in the quarters to come if the near-term budget cuts being called for in the debt limit fight are enacted.

This is not an argument for spending without limits. Given exploding health care costs as the baby boomers retire, budget cuts are unavoidable — but they are not urgent. With the economy weak and interest rates low, austerity makes no sense.

At this point, deep cuts are all but inevitable. But there are sensible things to be done to limit the harm. Budget cuts should be timed to begin as the economy recovers. Congress should vote to extend the federal unemployment benefits program and the payroll cut for employees. Republicans will likely oppose even those basic measures. So the White House and Congressional Democrats are going to have to do a better job of explaining economic reality than they have done so far.

Here is one point to start with: Allowing just those two programs to expire at the end of the year would needlessly shave nearly a full percentage point from growth in 2012.

Other measures should also be taken quickly. Lawmakers should pass a bill by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of , that could delay and reduce taxes on businesses, by forgiving for states that rebuild their unemployment funds. They should also reauthorize the highway trust fund, a crucial measure to repair infrastructure and create jobs, as called for in the Senate version of the transportation bill.

The administration should work to ease the rules for refinancing that are owned by and . Easier refinancings would lower monthly payments for potentially hundreds of thousands of borrowers in good standing and, in the process, free up spending money to spur the economy, at little or no cost to taxpayers.

Those are admittedly piecemeal steps to ameliorate huge economic problems. If the steps are not taken, policy makers are risking more quarters of anemic growth or, worse, renewed .
787 2011-07-31 Microsoft has gained some ground. Its Bing search site has steadily picked up traffic since its introduction two years ago, accounting for more than 14 percent of searches in the American market, according to comScore. Add the searches that Microsoft handles for Yahoo, in a partnership begun last year, and Microsoft’s search technology fields 30 percent of the total.

Yet those gains have not come at the expense of Google. Its two-thirds share of the market in the United States — Google claims an even higher share in many foreign markets — has remained unchanged in the last two years. The share losers have been Yahoo and smaller search players.

The costs for Microsoft, meanwhile, keep mounting. In the latest fiscal year, ended in June, the online services division — mainly the search business — lost $2.56 billion. The unit’s revenue rose 15 percent, to $2.53 billion, but the losses still exceeded the revenue.

Microsoft is a big, rich company. But investors are growing restless at the cost of its search campaign. In May, when David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager, called for Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s C.E.O., to be replaced, he pointed to the online unit as a particular sore spot.

Qi Lu, president of Microsoft’s online services division, sees the situation this way: “To break through, we have to change the game. But this is a long-term journey.”

MR. LU, 49, knows about long journeys — and persistence. His grandparents raised him in rural China, in a home without running water or electricity. A bright student, he won a scholarship to the doctoral program at Carnegie Mellon.

After stints at the Almaden Research Center of I.B.M. and at Yahoo, where he was in charge of its search and search ad technology, he joined Microsoft at the end of 2008. He was recruited by Mr. Ballmer, who assured him that Microsoft was committed to search and competing with Google for the long haul.

Paul Yiu came from Yahoo two years ago, impressed by Microsoft’s approach to competing in search. A business and product manager, Mr. Yiu had spent most of his career in Silicon Valley, often working for Microsoft adversaries like Netscape and Oracle.

He explains that in the valley, with its job-hopping and start-up culture, there is a “renters’ mentality”: if things aren’t working out, just move on. At Microsoft, he says, there is a “homeowners’ mentality”: a dedication to making things work.

“If you’re in the expensive search game, you need to have a homeowners’ mentality,” Mr. Yiu says.

Microsoft’s leadership knew years ago that becoming a real competitor to Google would take patience as well as dollars. In 2007, Mr. Ballmer met with Harry Shum, a computer scientist who led Microsoft’s research lab in Beijing at the time. Mr. Ballmer, as Mr. Shum recalls, told him that the company wanted to make a concerted push in search and bring in leading technical experts and business managers.

“You spent 10 years in research, and now you’ll spend the next 10 years in search,” he remembers Mr. Ballmer saying to him.

When Mr. Lu and Mr. Shum, another Ph.D. graduate of Carnegie Mellon, talk of changing the game, they mean making search smarter. Today’s search, they say, primarily finds topics, or noun phrases — a person’s name, a city, a product, a disease and so on.

“Search is still essentially a Web site finder.” Mr. Lu says. “It’s all nouns. But the future of search is verbs — computationally discerning user intent to give them the knowledge to complete tasks.”

The phrase that Microsoft uses is “decision engine,” as opposed to search engine.

New classes of information will help. Social network data, for example. Microsoft has an exclusive partnership with Facebook, and in May it included a feature for linking the “Like” tags of a person’s Facebook friends to that person’s search results in Bing. It might show, say, that 15 of your Facebook friends “liked” a certain restaurant. It is a first step, Mr. Lu says, in including trusted opinions in search — and not just the popular ones that conventional search does so well.

Location data, especially from the growing share of searches on smartphones, offers another rich stream of information. If the engine knows where you are, it can add another layer of context and knowledge to the search.

The ability to write increasingly responsive, full-featured applications for the Web — using the new HTML5 programming language — should also make search more intelligent. The goal, Mr. Lu says, is that someday you will speak a phrase into your smartphone — “dinner for two on Friday and movie after” — and the software will go to work. It will connect to your personal data — your location, your dining and film preferences. It will then connect to dining and restaurant reservation applications, like Yelp and OpenTable, and movie reservation applications like Fandango.

Then the engine will begin a dialogue: “Here’s what is available. Where would you like to eat and when?”

In short, Mr. Lu describes a vision of a search engine that is part intelligent software assistant and part mind reader.

In Bing, the most visible evidence of the decision-engine concept is the ability to aggregate and present specific kinds of information in a search result. Microsoft has invested in travel services, for example. Type “flights to San Francisco” into Bing, and below a few blue-shaded links to ads is a Bing Travel flight database. Click on departure and return dates, and it performs a full search of all flights and predicts whether the fare is likely to rise or fall in the days before the departure date. That feature is based on technology from Farecast, a start-up that Microsoft bought for $115 million in 2008.

Bing also uses technology from MedStory, a health search engine it bought four years ago for an undisclosed price, to pull together information from across the Web and present it in an on-screen box above the conventional search links. Type in “diabetes,” and the gray-shaded information box contains a short definition from the Mayo Clinic, along with a link to the full article. Just below are links to diabetes articles from other professional health publications. Next come links to four related conditions, like high blood pressure and obesity, and four to related medications. At the bottom are links to recent Twitter posts about diabetes.

Technology experts agree that Bing is making innovative strides. “There is so little context in current search, and what Microsoft is trying to do is present users with context and structure, more a map of the world of information instead of just ranking it, especially in specific subject areas like travel and health,” says Esther Dyson, an investor in start-ups and a longtime technology analyst. “Microsoft is trying to beat Google at this different game.”

But while Microsoft may be ahead in some facets, Google is innovating as well — and acquiring specialized technology to fold into its search engine. In April, the Justice Department approved Google’s $700 million purchase of ITA Software, which collects and organizes online data for airline flights. Last year, Google paid an undisclosed sum for MetaWeb, a start-up that used a vast database to better decipher the meaning, and not just the words, of search queries. In 2008, Microsoft paid an estimated $100 million for Powerset, a start-up that is also a specialist in so-called semantic search technology.

“Both these companies are making important steps to make search more intelligent,” says Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. “It’s an arms race.”

At Google, the Microsoft talk of a “decision engine” is regarded as a clever turn of phrase that merely describes the long-range ambition of search and information retrieval, as the field was called in the years before the Internet.

“The goal has always been the same,” explains Amit Singhal, a computer scientist who leads Google’s search team. “The progression is from data to useful information to knowledge that answers questions people have or helps them do things. Knowledge is the quest.”

IT’S a Wednesday morning in June, and Brian MacDonald is presiding over back-to-back product meetings for Bing.

Mr. MacDonald, 49 and a vice president, is a returnee to Microsoft. His first stint began in 1989, when Microsoft acquired a business software company he co-founded; he stayed on, managing the development of a series of programs in Microsoft’s lucrative Office business until 2001. In those 12 years, Microsoft’s share price soared, and stock options for managers yielded the kind of personal wealth that opened up life choices. He left, invested in a few start-ups, spent time with his young children. But his children became teenagers and the appeal of dabbling in start-ups faded, and he was lured back to Microsoft in 2007, when, he says, the company was finally becoming “focused and serious about search.”

The meetings are in a sixth-floor conference room in an office complex here in Bellevue, a Seattle suburb. (Most Bing employees work in Bellevue, needing more space than was available at the headquarters campus in Redmond.) Each meeting involves about a half-dozen designers and engineers ranging in age from the late 20s to 40s. A few others join in by phone and videoconference from Silicon Valley and India.

The first session focuses on software still in the concept stage, called Bing DeskBar. It is downloadable software for personal computers, and perhaps for smartphones and tablets. The DeskBar, in the early June prototype, sorts information by categories like people, documents and Web sites. It presents information in those categories in large on-screen icons, or tiles, and sorts data by what is most “recent, relevant and frequently used,” as one designer says.

The people feature, for example, sorts through communications including e-mail, Facebook and Twitter messages. The idea is to filter messages according to computed criteria — like those from your work colleagues, or from people you communicate with most often.

DeskBar is one of several experimental projects in the larger Bing strategy, Mr. MacDonald explains later. “You take a product category, you expand it and you own that expanded category,” he says. “We have a recipe.”

That is the formula that worked in the past for Microsoft in PC software, with Windows and Office. But whether that game plan will work against Google is uncertain at best.

The second meeting focuses on design tweaks in Bing’s next wave of improvements, which would be released into the search engine a few weeks later. The upgrades have come in six-month cycles since the preparations for Bing’s introduction in May 2009.

Each cycle is named for a city. First was Kiev, then Oslo, Boston and Denver. A recent upgrade was called Mountain View, for the Silicon Valley town where Google is based. The next three cycles will be named for rock bands formed in West Coast cities, gradually moving closer to Microsoft’s base: Metallica (Los Angeles), Nirvana (Aberdeen, Wash.) and Soundgarden (Seattle).

Witty code names aside, Bing has a long way to go. It is praised for improvements in search quality and features that distinguish it from Google, including its stylish home page — a different and striking picture each day, typically of a place, plant or animal, with four links to information about the subject that appear when a computer cursor passes over the image.

Advertisers have noticed Bing’s progress. Laura Desmond, C.E.O. of Starcom MediaVest, an ad strategy and placement agency, says Microsoft’s share of its corporate clients’ click volume from search ads has grown to 24 percent, from 14 percent, in the last nine months or so.

“Bing is clearly behind Google, but now it’s a scale player as well,” Ms. Desmond says.

Becoming a solid No. 2 behind Google is an accomplishment, but at what cost? Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft senior vice president, declined to say when the company planned to break even in search. The huge reported losses, he says, are a result of aggressive investment over the last few years to hire people and build data centers that can handle 30 percent to 40 percent of search traffic, first in the United States and later in other markets. Those upfront, fixed costs are enormous, Mr. Mehdi acknowledges, but once Microsoft’s search traffic and ad volumes rise, the financial picture could brighten quickly.

“As we grow share,” he says, “that really can drive the profitability, and that’s the key for us to turn to profitability and then grow beyond.”

Microsoft is not yet translating its search traffic — that 30 percent share in the United States, including the Yahoo partnership — into comparable ad dollars. Revenue per search from Yahoo traffic it handles is far less than it was when Yahoo managed its own search ads, Yahoo said in its recent earnings report. But Microsoft and Yahoo executives say the shortfall is temporary, a result of making a complex technology switch while a business is running.

“It’s a matter of time and effort, not an inability to do it,” says Mark Morrissey, a Yahoo senior vice president. “I’m as confident of the economic payoff from this partnership as I was on Day 1.”

IF those tech teething problems can be solved, the big remaining challenge will be attracting more traffic at Google’s expense. At this stage, says Mr. MacDonald at Microsoft, the greatest hurdle for Bing is the habitual behavior that works to Google’s advantage.

“For most people, Google is search — they go to Google without even thinking about it,” he says. “We’ve got to develop our own habits, of people trying Bing.”

Yes, says Mr. Singhal at Google, user habits are a powerful force that help his company. Those habits, he adds, result from Google’s doing so well for so long.

“Those habits are earned with trust over the years,” he says.

Still, there may be an opening for Microsoft, underdog that it is. Charlene Li, founder of the Altimeter Group, a tech research firm, calls herself a “huge Google user” who turns to its search engine many times a day. “It takes a lot to move me out of Google,” she says.

Yet Ms. Li says she now uses Bing for travel — finding airline flights — and sometimes to search for restaurants, too.

“Microsoft’s best hope is that it gets more and more people to migrate to Bing for specific tasks like travel,” she says. “Then, if they like what they see, they may use Bing more broadly.”
788 2011-07-31 Perhaps the most ambitious extended work for large ensemble will come from the saxophonist Joe Lovano’s nonet. The group, which will appear at Litchfield, will draw on Miles Davis’s classic “Birth of the Cool,” adapted in suite form for Mr. Lovano by Gunther Schuller, who played French horn on the 1957 Davis recording. When the nonet performs the suite live, Mr. Lovano said, the horn players take liberties, replacing long solo choruses with spur-of-the moment trading — “spontaneous, magical things happen that you can’t define.”

Like Mr. Lovano, the drummer Matt Wilson promises spontaneity within structure when he and his group — two reed players and a bassist — join with a string quartet at Litchfield. He said the material would vary in style, with shuffles like “Arts and Crafts” sharing the bill with Indian-inspired exercises like “Raga.”

“It’s more like it’s thrown in the blender than something you sprinkle on top,” Mr. Wilson said of the string quartet. The goal of the performance will be unwavering: full integration of the string quartet into the improvisatory flow.

Just as Mr. Wilson reimagines the “with strings” format, transforming the onstage assemblage into something of an octet, so do the smaller groups challenge convention. In the quartet James Farm, which will appear at Caramoor, authorship and improvisation are on an equal footing in an approach that owes as much to rock as to jazz tradition, said the group’s saxophonist, Joshua Redman.

“We’re interested in a band as a band,” he said, “in exploring the relationship between song, composition and spontaneous expression.”

The pianist Vijay Iyer courts the unexpected, employing conventional instrumentation — a bassist and drummer will join him at Litchfield — but avoiding standard song form. Even on tunes like “Abundance,” whose 12-bar patterning to some ears suggests a blues, he said, “we look to push ourselves from just playing nice sounds almost to a realm of danger.”

For Edmar Castaneda, the unconventional comes by dint of instrumentation. Mr. Castaneda plays the Colombian harp, and he will do so at Caramoor, his trio augmented by the singer and lyricist Andrea Tierra, with whom he will explore rhythms and text from South America in songs like “Canto.”

In a set at Litchfield, the Clayton Brothers quintet will also draw on Latin rhythms, though the group will fuse them with African sounds on pieces like “Soul Tango.” The bassist and co-leader, John Clayton, said the fusion had broadened the group’s comfort zone, but it was the hip-hop-inflected writing of his son, the pianist Gerald Clayton, that had altered its sense of syncopation.

A more immediate evocation of the hip-hop aesthetic will be evident in the music of another young pianist, Robert Glasper, who will bring a trio to Caramoor. Mr. Glasper, whose tunes like “FTB” recall his collaborations with performers like Mos Def, said it was important to reach out beyond the committed jazz audience.

That is a sentiment with which the pianist Fred Hersch agrees. Mr. Hersch, who said he may draw on his tributes to Billy Strayhorn, Lee Konitz or Bill Frisell in a duo set with the clarinetist Nico Gori at Caramoor, said his struggles with serious illness had inspired him to take greater risks in his writing, even as he felt the need to communicate more directly from the bandstand.

“I’d hate to see jazz devolve into hip cats playing hip stuff for hip cats,” he said.
789 2011-07-31 “Active feet,” Ms. Mather said. We flexed our feet, Barbie doll style. We inhaled, pressed down lower backs, held our breath, lifted tailbones, squeezed blocks. The squeeze lasted through eternity. We exhaled, lifted heads, then shoulders. We kept squeezing. Legs were quivering; minds were shrieking, “Get me out of here!” Inhale. Head down. Repeat.

Ms. Mather, who was previously enrolled in a doctoral program at Columbia, sees her practice as offering more than six-pack abs. “The thing that spoke to me about Forrest Yoga was the invitation to feel your body deeply and befriend your body as a source of wisdom and intelligence instead of something that you should occupy while you were on earth,” she said.

To become a Forrest Guardian, after a 200-hour foundational teacher training in 2006, Ms. Mather completed 400 hours of field work, a nine-day advanced teacher training and, upon invitation, a one-week Forrest Yoga mentorship training last year with Ms. Forrest. The Guardians meet with Ms. Forrest annually and mentor instructors who are in the equivalent of a post-graduate program.

Ms. Mather will help Ms. Forrest when she comes to New York to teach at Pure Yoga in early November as part of a tour for her new book, “Fierce Medicine: Breakthrough Practices to Heal the Body and Ignite the Spirit.” Like her mentor, Ms. Mather can do controlled handstands worthy of Cirque du Soleil, explain poses vividly and provide a comforting hands-on assist.

In New York, Forrest Yoga remains a boutique cult brand. “This is a very unique niche thing going on in New York City,” said Denise Hopkins, who teaches it mostly privately and at Bend and Bloom in Brooklyn. “It’s an underground scene.”

Forrest Yoga also resonates in classes that do not bear the moniker. Ms. Hopkins first heard of the style from teachers who led classes in a Forrest abdominal series, crediting the creator. Aarona Pichinson, who leads classes at the Kula Yoga Project in TriBeCa and at a YogaWorks in SoHo, once taught Forrest Yoga but dropped the name when her practice morphed into a more flowing vinyasa style.

“I’m so glad Erica is out there doing this because she does it really well and embodies what Ana does in so many ways,” said Ms. Pichinson, who added that her practice remained Forrest-inspired.

In addition to Ms. Mather and Ms. Hopkins, the Forrest cadre in New York includes Anna Mumford, who teaches at the Red Hook Recreation Center in Brooklyn, and Ramona Bradley and Emilia Conradson, who teach at the Om Factory in Manhattan. In Southampton, Leslie Pearlman teaches at the Ananda Yoga and Wellness Center.

“It’s great to have a network of really, really supportive Forrest teachers,” Ms. Mumford said. When she was laid off in February 2010 as a videographer from the American Civil Liberties Union, she said, the group encouraged her to commit to teaching along with starting a freelance video production company.

Ms. Mather theorized that the growth of Forrest Yoga in New York has been stalled by Ms. Forrest’s West Coast roots and the fact that a majority of urban dwellers go to the nearest yoga studio. But she said, “There is a critical mass of dedicated teachers to start to tip the scales in New York.”

She herself is having a breakthrough year in yoga. Ms. Mather taught in June at Wanderlust in Vermont with marquee names like Seane Corn and Rodney Yee. She taught last week at the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in the Berkshires. In New York, she will be leading Forrest Yoga Intensive workshops at Pure Yoga next weekend.

A vigilant guardian of the name, Ms. Mather insists that what she teaches be designated Forrest Yoga. “I’ve battled with some people about this, and ultimately I teach Forrest Yoga,” she said. “So let’s call it what it is, like Bikram or Iyengar.”
790 2011-07-31 Katharine Joy McCarthy and William Lincoln Rosener were married Saturday in Rye, N.Y. Carol A. Fabietti, an aunt of the bridegroom who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated at the Wainwright House, an event space.

The couple, both 26, met at Emory University, from which they graduated.

Mrs. Rosener is a research scientist at New York University, where she works in the Center for Latino and Adolescent Family Health, focusing on the reproductive health of minority populations in New York City, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. She has a master’s in public health from Columbia.

She is a daughter of Paula J. McCarthy and Gregory McCarthy of Guilford, Conn. The bride’s father is a professor of psychology at Yale, where he teaches cognitive neuroscience and conducts research on areas of the brain involved in social perception. Her mother is the principal at Melissa Jones Elementary School in Guilford.

Mr. Rosener works in New York as an associate in the alternative investments division of Credit Suisse, the investment bank; he sells private investment funds to institutional and individual clients.

He is a son of Susan F. Rosener and James D. Rosener of New York. The bridegroom’s father is the managing partner of the New York office of the law firm Pepper Hamilton.
791 2011-07-31 Carl W. Koivuniemi and Paul T. Burkhart Jr. were married Tuesday at the Town Hall in Southampton, N.Y. Sundy A. Schermeyer, the Southampton town clerk, officiated.

Mr. Koivuniemi (left), 63, retired as the deputy chief planning and budget officer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He graduated from Michigan State and received an M.B.A. from New York University. He served in the Peace Corps in 1969-72 as a high school English teacher in Cameroon. He is a son of the late Marie E. Koivuniemi and the late Reuben W. Koivuniemi of St. Ignace, Mich.

Mr. Burkhart, 70, retired as a vice president of the former Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York; he was in charge of the bank’s European commodities lending operations. He is a former lieutenant and helicopter pilot in the United States Navy. He graduated from Dartmouth. He is the son of the late Ruth E. Burkhart and the late Paul T. Burkhart of New Cumberland, Pa.
792 2011-07-31 Travelers seem to be gauging the safety of visiting Japan in different ways. Some rely on blogs that have posts written by foreigners living in Japan or frequent travelers to the country. Many, like Ms. Conroy and Ms. McMeans, turn to government advisories. The State Department says that “while the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains serious and dynamic, the health and safety risks to land areas which are outside a 50-mile radius of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are low.” In Britain, the Foreign Office advises against travel to the parts of northeastern Japan hit by the earthquake and tsunami, and to within 37 miles of the reactors in Fukushima. But “the situation in Japan outside of these specific areas has largely returned to normal and most visits are trouble free,” the office said.

Some visitors said that if the risks were truly great, governments would advise against traveling to Japan, which has not been the case. “I felt I had to do my own homework because the Japanese have a stiff upper lip about these things,” said Jack Jaffe, who last month visited Tokyo on business from Los Angeles, where he works for a Japanese electronics company. “But I checked the U.K. and U.S. Web sites and both essentially said the same thing: That outside the zone near the reactors, things are O.K.”

Still, skepticism remains about the Japanese government’s handling of the crisis, including its ability to monitor radiation levels in the air, soil and water. The government has lifted many of the bans on the sale of milk and some vegetables, but abnormal levels of radiation have been found in green tea leaves grown in Shizuoka, and some contaminated beef recently found its way into restaurants and shops. But these are largely viewed as isolated instances. In its fact sheet on food and water safety in Japan, the American embassy in Tokyo states that “the Government of Japan is taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the food and water supply."

Given the doubts, the decision to visit has turned into a proxy of sorts on how the rest of the world views Japan. For some would-be visitors, no amount of reassurances or discount airfares could persuade them to visit now.

“We’ve had two aftershocks in the last couple of weeks, and I get e-mails from clients almost immediately asking if it’s safe to visit,” said Daniel Simon, the general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi, where bookings are down 50 percent. Mr. Simon said he tells customers that Tokyo has some of the most earthquake resistant buildings in the world and that the city is far from the reactors in Fukushima. But “we don’t really think the high-end leisure traveler will come back until Chinese New Year 2012 because there’s still too much negative news in the media about Japan.”

Fears are so pervasive that arrivals at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, 360 miles from Fukushima, fell 47 percent in May. “I’ve been asked half a dozen times whether I’m afraid of the radiation,” said Ed Kornhauser, a pianist from San Diego who has traveled from Osaka to Okinawa since May. “A lot of hostel owners tell me tourism is way down. They want to know why foreigners aren’t coming.”

Mr. Kornhauser said he felt comfortable visiting Japan because he knew he would be far from Fukushima. Despite the fears expressed by his friends, he was reassured after reading the State Department’s Web site. “After the earthquake, I didn’t think twice,” he said. “My friends blew it out of proportion. This is a fairly big country.”

But confidence can be fragile when it involves radiation. So hotels, including high-end places like the Okura and the Imperial in Tokyo, have tried to entice visitors with discounts of up to 50 percent. Deals also abound for tours, which has helped lure back visitors from Hong Kong and other places in Asia. “It’s less crowded now, and package tour prices are down 20 to 50 percent,” said Masaki Hirata, the executive director of marketing and promotion at the Japan National Tourism Organization.

Some hoteliers are attempting to directly reassure customers that their inns are far from trouble. Kisaburo Minato, who runs the Kimi Ryokan in Tokyo, recently wrote on his inn’s Web site that “the emergency at Fukushima is being exaggerated in the foreign press” and that except in the area near the reactors, “life goes on as normal.”

Indeed, little has changed in Tokyo, except for the energy conservation measures that include turning up thermostats on air-conditioners. In Sendai, the closest big city to the earthquake’s epicenter, restaurants, hotels and shops downtown are open for business. It is only when visitors go to the neighborhoods within a couple of miles of the Pacific Ocean that they see the impact of the tsunami.

Still, many tourists are erring on the side of caution, said Ellie Colin, who handles corporate and leisure travel at the Ovation Travel Group in New York. One client, she said, canceled a $62,000 trip.

“The headlines were really bleak and every single day they got more and more nervous,” said Ms. Colin, who has not booked any leisure trips to Japan since. “My feeling is that it’s going to take until next year and some really good P.R. out of Japan before leisure travelers return.”
793 2011-07-31 But since the 1930s, things have evolved. Mimi Neuhaus, who owns Neuhaus Realty and has sold homes in Staten Island since 1969, says the enclave has gradually become a year-round home for people who like its beachfront calm at relatively inexpensive prices.

It was made all the more desirable starting in the mid-1990s, when a multimillion-dollar restoration got under way for the beach and its boardwalk.

The 2.5-mile Franklin D. Roosevelt boardwalk has a healthy share of cyclists and joggers. And in 2003, the city completed construction of an 835-foot fishing pier, where anglers on a recent day had some luck catching sea robin and striped bass.

But about a week ago, beachgoers got a rude reminder that although Midland Beach may at times seem a peaceful natural refuge, it is also very much a part of New York City. After a fire at the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant in Manhattan caused the release of untreated sewage into the Hudson and Harlem Rivers over a period of three days. As of late last week the city was still advising visitors to Midland Beach (among other shoreline neighborhoods) to stay out of the water.

It was in the 1990s, as renovations to the beach were taking place, that the neighborhood’s residential streets were also changing. Scott Setaro, the vice president for operations of Appleseed Homes, said it was at this point that developers tore down many of the area’s characteristic bungalows. In many cases, they were replaced with much larger semidetached homes, like the one owned by Ms. Shuster, which was built a few years before her family moved in.

Even with this larger share of pumped-up property, however, the neighborhood remains relatively free of traffic and feels far removed from the bustle of other boroughs.

Perhaps the most bucolic area is on the wetlands area on the north side, with its homes surrounded by grasses more than eight feet high.

The wetlands, along New Creek, are part of the Staten Island Bluebelt, a storm-water management system for much of the borough. Stretches are still being developed, but the New Creek Bluebelt, which covers 2,200 acres, is already in service in Midland Beach.

Fiorella Raimondi has lived next to the wetlands for 15 years, in a detached three-bedroom one-bath ranch that she bought for $120,000 and lives in with her 9-year-old daughter.

She loves the neighborhood, she said, but the maintenance of her yard, which at 60 by 95 feet is on the larger side for Midland Beach, is getting to be too expensive and time-consuming. So she is now trying to sell the house; it has been listed for about six months at $367,500.

She doesn’t plan to go far; she’d like to stay in Staten Island, but maybe live in a condo. It’s “peaceful and serene” in Midland Beach, she said. “You don’t hear any noises except for crickets.”

The boundaries of Midland Beach, which is shaped roughly like an arrowhead, can be subject to disagreement, but according to most sources the eastern border runs along Father Capodanno Boulevard to about Graham Boulevard. The line follows Graham west before moving in a zigzag fashion to the southwest, eventually reaching Boundary Avenue, its westernmost line. Miller Field, a military airfield turned park, marks the southern border.

Under a square mile in area, the area has roughly 6,000 people, the vast majority of them white. It rises uphill from the water, and the many dead-end streets seem to help discourage fast traffic.

For many decades, Italian- and Irish-Americans were the predominant group in the area. But Russian immigrants have recently increased in number.

Two types of housing stock predominate: small one-story bungalows, often with just one bedroom and built decades ago, and two-story brick semidetached homes or town houses built much more recently, many in the last 10 years.

These two groups of housing are found side by side throughout the area, small homes perched next to large new buildings with two or more units.

The lots in the area, said Laura B. Vallone, an agent for Vitale Sunshine Realty, are generally on the smaller side for Staten Island, some of them just 25 feet by 60 feet, which helps limit building size.

Midland Avenue, which cuts through the center of things, is the main commercial strip. It has some stores, but shopping is more profitably pursued nearby, along Hylan Boulevard, which for several miles is lined with retail of all kinds.

Joe LaRocca helps run LaRocca’s Italian Ices and Pizzeria, a business that has spent 25 years along Midland Avenue. In his view, the new residential construction has changed the neighborhood for the better. “It has grown by leaps and bounds,” he said. “It’s become a place to be.”

Ms. Vallone of Vitale Sunshine says that prices in the area, as in Staten Island generally, are down as much as 15 percent from their peak a few years ago. Even so, she added, the sales pace has picked up in recent months.

According to Ms. Neuhaus, prices are often slightly lower than in South Beach, the beachfront community just to the northeast. But, as in South Beach, proximity to the beach is the key pricing factor. One-story bungalows, Ms. Vallone said, generally cost $200,000 or more, while town houses and semidetached homes start at $300,000 and larger detached single-family homes often run $500,000 or more. A recent search found more than 50 properties for sale, including 17 detached houses and 17 single-family semidetached properties.

Although much of the area is owner-occupied, Ms. Neuhaus says one-bedroom bungalows are available for rent for about $1,000 a month, semidetached homes for $1,600 or more.

WHAT TO DO

The beach is the recreational watchword. And after working up an appetite there, you might stop up the hill at La Rocca’s. For just a couple of dollars, customers can get one of their more than 100 flavors of ices, including rainbow cookie, a popular choice.

For green space there is Miller Field, just to the south. Its 187 acres have sports fields and picnic areas.

Options include Public School 38, which has about 380 students enrolled in kindergarten through fifth grade. Last year, 55 percent of fourth graders met standards in reading and 75 percent in math.

Intermediate School 2, which has about 930 students in sixth through eighth grade, is not far away. Last year, 35 percent of eighth graders met standards in reading and 39 in math.

There is no high school within neighborhood boundaries. Among the possibilities nearby is New Dorp High School, just to the south. Its graduation rate in 2010 was 74 percent, 13 points above the city’s average. SAT averages last year were 446 in math, 431 in reading and 434 in writing, versus 462, 439 and 434 citywide.

St. Margaret Mary’s School, which serves students in kindergarten through eighth grade, is also in the neighborhood.

Many commuters rely on cars. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is nearby, and getting to Lower Manhattan can take as little as 30 minutes — or much longer, depending on traffic.

Several express buses are available, among them the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 and X9. They travel to Manhattan, taking 40 minutes or more to arrive in Midtown.

The S51 and the S81, which has limited stops, also run through the neighborhood, taking riders to the Grant City stop of the Staten Island Railway. The train takes commuters to the Staten Island Ferry, which takes about 30 minutes to cross the water.

In September 1900, visitors to Midland Beach witnessed an unexpected show. Beach employees had built a fence to separate the area from Woodland Beach, a resort to the immediate south, to shut off passage between the two. About 15 people on the Woodland side took offense and took axes to the fence in broad daylight. “There was some blood shed,” according to an article in The New York Times, “but that was before the police arrived.”
794 2011-07-31 The concentrated essence of this curious book is contained in its 11th chapter, which attempts to explain what the “Mona Lisa” has in common with Chicken McNuggets, vampire novels and the concluding scene of most pornographic videos. Each of these works of human creativity, Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam write in “A Billion Wicked Thoughts,” exploits perceptual trickery to arouse and gratify our desires. The enigma of the Gioconda smile; the technologically engineered “crave­ability” of fast food; the alluring, “alpha among alphas” quality of the paranormal hero; that climactic moment beamed to watchers on a hundred million laptop screens: all rely on the artful manipulation of our brains.

That ultimate pornographic image in particular, the authors write, “is an erotical illusion that merges the visual with the psychological” and that juxta­poses “three sexual cues within a single stimulus: the penis (a visual cue), the ejaculation (which may be a sperm competition cue or possibly a cued interest in some men), and — most important — the woman’s emotional reaction, which may be a psychological cue of female pleasure (if she expresses delight) or a psychological cue of sexual submission (if she expresses surprise or dismay).” And you thought it was all just masturbation.

“A Billion Wicked Thoughts” promises to reveal “the truth about what men and women secretly desire — and why.” Ogas and Gaddam, cognitive neuroscientists who met as graduate students at Boston University, analyzed a year’s worth of terms entered into the search engine aggregator Dogpile between July 2009 and July 2010, and found that 55 million of the roughly 400 million terms were sexual in nature. The authors organized those searches into a ranked hierarchy of categories. “Youth” was No. 1 and “breasts” was No. 4. “Cheating wives,” “gay” and “penises” all made the top 10.

Ogas and Gaddam purport to have discovered in this data — with the aid of sex research, evolutionary psychology and comments posted on pornography hubs and other Web sites — “the finite set of sexual cues” (analogous to the five different taste cues our tongues can discern) hard-wired into our neural circuitry that “activate our desire software.”

Their breakdown is simple. Men like pornography. Women like romance novels. “Men’s brains are designed to objectify females,” Ogas and Gaddam write. Since men’s only concern is with the biological fitness of women for child­bearing, everything they need to know to feel desire is visible to the naked eye: “The shapely curves of female ornamentation indicate how many years of healthy childbearing remain across a woman’s entire lifetime.” Male desire is “solitary, quick to arouse, goal-targeted, driven to hunt.” That’s why there was a nearly perfect concordance between male reports of sexual arousal and evidence of physical arousal measured by a device attached to participants’ genitals in a well-known study by the sex researcher Meredith Chivers.

By contrast, Chivers found that a lot more blood flowed to the genitals of her female subjects than their self-reports would suggest. Straight men were physically aroused by videos of straight sex, but not by videos of gay sex or bonobos mating, and their self-reports confirmed what the sensors measured. Straight women were physically aroused by every­thing, including the bonobos, but their self-reports often contradicted what the sensors measured.
795 2011-07-31 He had intended to furnish the large patio so he could garden and read outside, but quickly realized that the constant drone from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway meant he would never use it. With the job market sluggish, Mr. Rethemeyer, 52, then considered returning to San Francisco, but “giving it another year became kind of a mantra,” he said.

He was, however, eager to move to a place that was less expensive and better suited to his needs. The room where he slept, for instance, was dark, and Mr. Rethemeyer had “discovered I don’t like sleeping in a cave.” Some kind of view was necessary “for my own sanity.”

And the utility bills were enormous — almost $400 a month. He began to suspect he was paying for more than his own electricity. He gave his landlord notice.

His new neighborhood, as well as the building, would have to be dog-friendly, for 14-year-old Topeka, an Australian shepherd mix.

“I didn’t realize how big a consideration Topeka is in my life, but she really is,” Mr. Rethemeyer said.

Topeka moves slowly in inclement weather. She prefers to be walked on grass, and it would be best if it was nearby.

“When I have to get to work and she’s poking along,” getting her in and out “becomes a bit of an issue,” Mr. Rethemeyer.

He began his hunt on his Dumbo street. A move to No. 25 Washington, the newly opened Gair2 building, where one-bedrooms start around $2,400, would be a cinch. But when Mr. Rethemeyer was told that dogs weren’t allowed, he replied, “This is ridiculous, because the whole point of being in Dumbo is either to have kids or have dogs.” Ongoing construction on the street was another argument against the building. (Gair2 had a change in policy and now allows dogs.)

Friends suggested he could rent in Manhattan for around the same price. Online, he found a new high-rise tower in Chelsea advertised by Baris Tuncer, who was then at the Level Group and is now at Keller Williams. That building didn’t allow pets, but Mr. Tuncer showed him several similar buildings that did.

Glass-and-steel Mercedes House on 53rd Street near 11th Avenue was sleek and lovely. But the amenities wouldn’t be completed for a year. There wasn’t much of a neighborhood, either. Though DeWitt Clinton Park was nearby and had a dog run, it had little green space. (All of the building’s studios are now rented; remaining one-bedrooms start around $4,000 a month.)

Mr. Rethemeyer moved on to the soaring tower called New York by Gehry, at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan. He had watched the building rise from his place across the river at the ClockTower. Starting prices for studios and one-bedrooms are $2,630 and $3,580, respectively. But the neighborhood had too much traffic for Topeka. “I began to compare and contrast things,” taking into account price, size and neighborhood, he said.

MiMA, on West 42nd Street, included Dog City, a dog spa with a full array of services. But traffic was also a problem there. “Topeka takes her sweet time crossing the street,” Mr. Rethemeyer said, “and I thought, she doesn’t have it in her.” He crossed Midtown off his list.

Charmed by the notion of moving from Main Street to Wall Street, he then checked out some places in the financial district, purposely visiting on a Sunday. “If it’s going to feel desolate,” he said, “I want to know that now.”

The neighborhood felt more vacant than he liked, and he wondered where he would shop for food. Though traffic was not going to be a problem for Topeka, the neighborhood included too many concrete sidewalks and not enough grass.

A friend suggested that he consider some of the new buildings in Williamsburg. “I had a thing in my head where it is a lot of 20-somethings and I didn’t think I would fit in there,” Mr. Rethemeyer said.

But he changed his mind once he visited. “There were some older people, and artists,” he said. “I felt: I can come here and be happy and there’s life going on.”

By this point, he had just days to move. If no suitable place presented itself, he had more than half a mind to put his stuff in storage, rent a car and go on a long road trip with Topeka.

Then he saw the Edge, a twin-towered building on the waterfront, and was instantly taken, both with the apartments and with the amenities — plenty of fitness equipment, spa facilities, game rooms, movie rooms, even a swimming pool.

The Edge is a condominium, but an owner with nine units had just put them up for rent, said the agent, Rachel Altschuler of Prudential Douglas Elliman. All went quickly, including the 490-square-foot studio with a sweeping view of Manhattan that Mr. Rethemeyer took for $2,200 a month, plus $50 a month for the dog.

He arrived last month. His floor is largely vacant. “It is like the beginning of the semester and nobody had shown up yet,” he said. (The Edge is now 65 percent sold, a spokeswoman said.)

There are a few new-building glitches — he had trouble, for instance, obtaining the stickers necessary for storing his two bicycles in the bike room. But Topeka, with plenty of grass nearby, is contented there and so is he. Only now does he realize how loud Dumbo was, with its ambient traffic noise. “Being away from that,” he said, “it is nice not to hear that all the time.”

His photography equipment is in storage in New Jersey, which he reaches via Zipcar, the car-sharing service.

Granted, his new apartment has far less space than its predecessors. “But,” he said, “it has much more of what I enjoy.”
796 2011-07-31 At this point, only Renault is making cars designed for quick battery swaps. The company stretched the gasoline-powered version of its Fluence, a Corolla-like sedan, by five inches to accommodate the suitcase-size 24-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The resulting Fluence Z.E., for zero emissions, goes into full production later this year, available in either swappable or fixed-battery versions.

My 20-minute drive in the Fluence Z.E. from the Better Place offices in Copenhagen to the swap station in the suburb of Gladsaxe, was pleasingly uneventful. The swap station adjoins a filling station, where a gallon of gasoline was priced at the equivalent of $9.15 and diesel was $8.40.

The battery swap was also uneventful. Swipe a membership card at the entrance and the garage door to the battery-change track, similar to a carwash tunnel, opens. Pull forward and the robot takes over — the driver simply shifts into neutral and lets go.

As the car is guided forward, it’s lifted a few inches. Inside the car, you hear buzzes and hums and feel vibrations, but there’s no view of what is happening below. About a minute into the experience, the dashboard message indicates empty battery — meaning it’s gone — after which there’s no air-conditioning, although music and other functions continue. During most of Denmark’s year, the brief lack of climate control would not be a problem, but during my trip, on a hot summer day, the sealed cabin quickly became steamy.

That small discomfort did not mar the significance of the occasion: four and a half minutes after entering the station, the car had a fresh battery. The sedan was lowered and we pulled out of the tunnel ready to drive another 100 miles or so, according to Renault’s range estimate. The Better Place robot worked.

Better Place subscribers purchase their cars, but not the expensive battery packs. For a fixed fee of about $350 a month, they will lease access to the batteries, swap stations and charge points.

Renault says it intends to produce more than 100,000 Fluence Z.E. sedans through 2015, although availability in Denmark will be limited. Another battery-swappable model from Renault, the Zoe Z.E. — a smaller hatchback more suited to Danish tastes — is expected next year. But it could be a number of years before other carmakers produce models that work with the Better Place stations.

The economics are challenging. Each station costs “a couple of million Euros” — about $3 million — to build, Mr. Hansen said. That is a big investment for stations that might barely be used in the next couple of years.

The Better Place business model is a top-down, central-office approach to electric car charging infrastructure. Whether that plan will work may be uncertain, but its Danish swap station does deliver as promised.

When E.V.’s finally arrive here, Denmark could be one of a few places in the world to have eliminated limited driving range and insufficient charging spots as potential obstacles to the adoption of electric cars.
