"'3','2014-11-01','We are excited to share our fantasy football matchup analysis charts with you for the quarterback, running back and wide receiver (WR1 and WR2) positions. They are a way to visualize matchup data as well as to see how well a player has done in recent weeks or for the entire season.

In order to address any questions on how to use the charts, we thought a Q and A format would be the most effective. If you have any other questions, please find us on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy.

Q: What exactly is matchup analysis data?

A: Matchup analysis data is one of the most commonly used metrics in fantasy football analysis because it is the most straightforward and simple to calculate. It is simply the average amount of fantasy points that a defense is allowing to a particular position on a weekly basis.

Q: How effective are these charts in predicting fantasy performance?

A: As anyone who follows it knows, football is very unpredictable and there is no shortage of weekly examples where a player performs well despite an unfavorable matchup. The more dynamic the player, the more likely this is to happen, which is why we include results on the charts, so you can see when a player defies the matchup.

We believe that with each passing week, matchup analysis data becomes more reliable, because as the sample size grows, so does the credibility of the statistic. The average means more based on 10 games as opposed to three.'"

The Walk Free Foundation, a human rights group based in Australia, examined 167 countries and found that India had an estimated 14.3 million people who were victims of slavery.

The index defines slavery as the control or possession of people in such a way as to deprive them of their freedom with the intention of exploiting them for profit or sex, usually through violence or coercion. The definition includes forced labor, forced marriage and debt bondage. After India, China has the most with 3.2 million, then Pakistan (2.1 million), Uzbekistan (1.2 million) and Russia (1 million), according to the Walk Free index. About 60,100 people are exploited as forced laborers in the United States, the report says. Other groups offer different global estimates.

"'131','2014-11-20','The situation has contributed to a growing alarm among aid agencies over what they see as the decreasing options for Syrians seeking refuge from the war tearing their country apart. A recent report by two aid groups showed the number of Syrians accepted as refugees in the region declined by 88 percent last month as nations like Jordan that already host many refugees are becoming overwhelmed.

The Jordanian government, which limits access by journalists to the border, would not discuss the aid agencies' claims about the people waiting just over the border.

""We cannot attest to something outside our border,"" said Mohammad Momani, a government spokesman, adding that all those arriving at border crossings were being screened according to the procedures agreed on with the United Nations.

In an interview, Mr. Harper of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.) said that the numbers of refugees crossing into Jordan had decreased sharply since September.

""In September, we've had around 6,000 people cross into Jordan; in October, we've had around 500 people; and in November, we've had very very few people cross the border,"" Mr. Harper said. The International Organization for Migration figures also attest to the drop in numbers.

The Syrian civil war, now in its fourth year, has caused an influx of more than 600,000 refugees to Jordan, which has a population of 6.5 million. Lebanon, Egypt and Turkey have been among other countries taking in some of the more than three million Syrians who have fled the fighting.

But the joint report by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee released last week suggested that many civilians who were fleeing were finding it more difficult to find refuge, leading to ""a new level of hopelessness.""

On average, more than 150,000 Syrians were able to cross into neighboring countries each month in 2013, the report said. Last month, the number of new refugees declined to 18,453.

Lebanon last month announced it was denying entry to all but ""exceptional"" refugee cases.

In Jordan, analysts and aid workers say the refugees appear, in part, to be caught in a struggle over who will take care of them in the long term.

""Jordan is saying we cannot bear this responsibility alone anymore,"" said Oraib al-Rantawi, director of Al Quds Center for Political Studies, a Jordanian research institute. ""The international community and the Arab countries need to contribute and find a solution to the refugee crisis whether it's through direct aid and support to Jordan or through safe areas or havens inside Syria.""

Petra, the official Jordanian news agency, on Wednesday picked up a news report from Japan in which the king, who is visiting, thanked the country for its aid but also spoke of the continuing challenges for his country.

""Foreign aid to Jordan and to the U.N. refugee agency reached only 29 percent of what is needed this year, and the rest of burden will fall onto our shoulders,"" King Abdullah II is quoted saying.

In addition, fears of infiltration rose after Jordan in September joined the United States-led military campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group operating in Syria and Iraq.

As winter approaches, aid agencies worry conditions will further deteriorate for the refugees stranded on Jordan's border. The aid agencies say they have been allowed to provide basic aid such as food and blankets through the Jordanian military and border guards. But they have not been allowed to visit the refugees.

""We're calling on all the countries in the region to allow those refugees who are fleeing the conflict to enter and calling on the international community to do more,"" Mr. Harper said.'"

"'164','2014-11-25','Smoking through a hookah is not harmless, according to a new study. In addition to the usual tobacco carcinogens, dangerous levels of benzene are inhaled from the lump of smoldering charcoal that ignites the moist tobacco mixture.

Benzene is known to cause leukemia and is a suspected cause of other cancers. Every American has low levels from car exhaust and other pollutants, but no level is considered safe.

Smoking a mix of tobacco, fermented fruit, molasses and other flavorings through a water pipe has been common in the Middle East for centuries. The habit has spread to the West in recent years under various names, including hookah, shisha and argileh.

For the study, scientists from San Diego State University measured levels of S-phenylmercapturic acid, a breakdown product of benzene, in the urine of more than 100 hookah smokers and their nonsmoking companions on the mornings after they had all been to hookah lounges.

The daily smokers had almost six times as much benzene byproduct in their urine as typical nonsmoking Americans do. After long evenings of smoking, some had 10 times as much.

Their companions, who inhaled secondhand smoke, had levels only about half those of the smokers, but still higher than average nonsmoking Americans.'"
