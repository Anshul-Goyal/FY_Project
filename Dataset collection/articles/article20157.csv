"'7','2015-07-02','The payroll processor ADP said that businesses added 237,000 jobs last month, compared with 203,000 in May. That is the most since December. The report buoys evidence that rising consumer spending and a healthy housing market are supporting more hiring. Americans have spent freely in recent months, and home sales are running at their best pace in eight years. Construction companies added 19,000 jobs last month, while retail, shipping and utility companies gained 50,000. On Thursday, the government will issue its official jobs report for June. Economists forecast that it will show that employers added 233,000 jobs. The ADP survey covers only private businesses, however, and frequently diverges from the official figures.'"
"'8','2015-07-02','With a few counties still refusing to allow same-sex marriages as they issued licenses to heterosexual couples, a federal judge ruled Wednesday that all must abide by court decisions allowing same-sex unions. Opposition withered as some counties complied with the decision, and gay marriage advocates said they would ask courts to impose penalties on the holdouts. Judge Callie Granade of Federal District Court in Mobile issued a brief order saying that state probate judges cannot discriminate against gay couples since the United States Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is legal everywhere. The order does not affect counties that have stopped issuing all marriage licenses.'"
