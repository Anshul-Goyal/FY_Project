Hertz, which replaced its chief financial officer in December, was scheduled to report results May 7, but delayed the announcement, saying more work was required. The company did not say on Friday when it would release its results. The car rental industry is picking up as business and leisure travel increases along with an improving economy in the United States.

"'96','2014-06-14','After a long climb from the valley, the number of jobs has finally reached the previous peak of January 2008, with gains of more than 8.5 million jobs since early 2010. Still, the working-age population has grown substantially in the last six years, and the nation's economy, by reliable estimates, is at least seven million jobs below its potential. That has cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in lost output.

With the weak recovery from the recession, more than four million people are still considered among the long-term unemployed, out of work for at least half a year. They face considerably dimmer prospects of finding another job as their skills deteriorate and their contact with the world of work fades.

And that does not count the more than six million who have opted out of the labor force altogether, even taking into account demographic factors like the aging of the population.

Economists hope that many such people will be lured back to work as business improves and that wages will rise as the labor market tightens. But for now, the slack in the economy has served to hold down pay; wages for roughly four-fifths of American workers have declined since 2007, after adjusting for inflation.'"

In a poll of some nearby countries conducted in April and May by the Pew Research Center, large majorities in all but Turkey expressed fear that Al Qaeda or some other extremist group could take control of Syria. Concern was greatest in neighboring Lebanon, where about two-thirds of Christians were very concerned, along with about half of Sunnis and Shiites.

Beyond Lebanon, more than two-thirds of the public were very or somewhat concerned in Israel, Jordan and Egypt. In Turkey, which shares a border with Syria and Iraq, only 49 percent were very or somewhat concerned about the possibility of an extremist takeover.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that the problems had been reported with gels, face washes, pads and other products that contained two ingredients: benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. But the agency says it was unclear whether those ingredients set off the reactions or whether some other combination of ingredients was to blame. The over-the-counter treatments are sold as Proactiv, Neutrogena, MaxClarity, Oxy, Aveeno and other brands. For now, the agency wants consumers to stop using the products if they experience tightness of the throat, breathing problems, lightheadedness or swelling of the eyes, face or lips.'"
