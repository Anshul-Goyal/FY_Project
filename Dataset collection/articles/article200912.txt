29 2009-12-01 Max Eisen, a Broadway press agent from the days when feeding tidbits of gossip to columnists like Walter Winchell and staging stunts were standard practice for stirring up a bit more box-office appeal, died on Nov. 23 at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.

His son, Glenn, said he died of natural causes.

From his office above Sardi’s on West 44th Street — its walls lined with framed posters from the shows he promoted — Mr. Eisen worked the phone and clacked out press releases on his battleship-gray electric typewriter for more than four decades. From 1954 to 1997 he was the press agent for more than 60 Broadway shows and dozens of Off Broadway productions.

In 1964, when he was representing five Broadway shows at once, Mr. Eisen staged a mini-Olympics in Shubert Alley — a blockwide stretch between 44th and 45th Streets — in which 30 performers from seven shows raced before eight photographers, an ABC television crew and a crowd of 600. A dancer in the “Folies Bergère” won three of the eight events: the 50-yard dash, the 100-yard dash and the half-mile (back and forth) walk.

“This is the crowning achievement in lunacy,” a member of Mr. Eisen’s staff said at the time.

Among the productions Mr. Eisen promoted were “The Matchmaker” (1955-57), “The World of Charles Aznavour” (1965), “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown” (1971), “Raisin” (1973-75), a revival of “Guys and Dolls” (1976-77), “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds” (1978) and a revival of “The Wiz” (1984).

Born in the Bronx on Oct. 19, 1918, Mr. Eisen was the only child of Samuel and Molly Eisen, who owned a candy store. Besides his son, Glenn, he is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Barbara Glenn; his daughter, Lee Kittay ; and five grandchildren.

Mr. Eisen served in the Army in Europe during World War II. For several years after the war, he worked in the circulation department of what was then The Paris Herald Tribune. In the early 1950s he returned to New York and started his company.

In an interview with The New York Times in 1997, Mr. Eisen spoke about the excitement of waiting on opening nights for those late-night newspaper reviews. There were flops, like “Some of My Best Friends,” starring Ted Knight, in 1977. “Everybody congratulated him, everybody shook his hand,” Mr. Eisen said. “But nobody bought a ticket.”
30 2009-12-01 For young women who have a high risk of breast cancer because of genetic mutations or family history, the radiation from yearly mammograms may make the risk even higher, researchers reported at a radiology conference on Monday.

The report is particularly troubling because it suggests that the very women who are told they need mammograms most may also be the most vulnerable to harm from them. Doctors routinely urge high-risk women to have mammograms earlier in life and more often than women judged to be at average risk.

Researchers caution that the new report is not conclusive, and that the issue needs more study.

High doses of radiation can increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in young women, but mammography uses a low dose. The American Cancer Society and many breast cancer experts say the benefits of screening far outweigh any theoretical risk from the radiation.

But the new findings will probably fuel the debate that was ignited by a recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association questioning the value of breast cancer screening and a report by a government task force suggesting that most women could start having mammograms later in life and repeat them less often than had generally been recommended.

The latest findings come not from new research, but from an analysis that pooled the data from six earlier studies involving about 5,000 high-risk women in the United States and Europe, some who had breast cancer and some who did not. Their median age was 45.
31 2009-12-01 North Korea will redenominate the won currency to drop two zeros from the nominal value of bills in an effort to fight inflation and clamp down on black-market trading, South Korea’s main news agency reported. The Yonhap news agency quoted multiple North Korean foreign trading officials based in China as saying that the reform measure was implemented at 11 a.m. on Monday and made people rush to convert their won currency into yuan or United States dollars on the black markets. After the conversion, 1,000-won notes were to be exchanged for 10-won notes.
32 2009-12-01 Canada’s economy grew for the first time in four quarters from July through September, signaling that the country’s first recession since 1992 has ended. Gross domestic product expanded at a 0.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 1 percent annualized gain, based on the median of 19 responses. The second-quarter decrease, initially reported at 3.4 percent, was revised to a 3.1 percent annualized decline. The third-quarter figure is lower than the Bank of Canada’s prediction for 2 percent annualized growth. Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada, said last month the growth could come in “softer” than his formal prediction, adding the “profile” for a strengthening recovery next year remains intact. “There is reason to be optimistic that growth will build for the fourth quarter” from today’s “fairly weak return to positive growth,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, citing the gain in domestic spending.
33 2009-12-01 PEORIA, Ill. (AP) — Caterpillar said Monday it plans to buy a subsidiary of a South Korean manufacturer of components for earthmoving and other machinery.

The company said it would acquire JCS Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Jinsung T.E.C. Company. Terms were not disclosed.

The acquisition builds on a relationship between Caterpillar, based in Peoria, and Jinsung T.E.C., which supplies Caterpillar with equipment for its machines.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed early next year.

Jinsung T.E.C. specializes in the design and manufacture of heavy equipment spare parts, including track rollers, seal groups and front idlers for excavators and bulldozers.

The transaction will give Caterpillar its first factory in South Korea. Caterpillar already has plants in China, India, Indonesia and Australia.
34 2009-12-01 Administration officials said the report provided a lift to the bill, which embodies Mr. Obama’s top domestic priority.

“The C.B.O. has rendered a fundamental judgment that this will reduce the deficit and reduce people’s premium costs,” said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who huddled with Senate Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill on Monday. “All the Republican leadership will guarantee you is the status quo.”

But Republican senators like Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said the report validated their concerns. They focused on the prediction that unsubsidized premiums in the individual insurance market, less than a fifth of those with health insurance, would rise an average of 10 percent to 13 percent.

“The analysis by the Congressional Budget Office confirms our worst fears,” Mr. Grassley said. “Millions of people who are expecting lower costs as a result of health reform will end up paying more in the form of higher premiums. For large and small employers that have been struggling for years with skyrocketing health insurance premiums, C.B.O. concludes this bill will do little, if anything, to provide relief.”

The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the highly partisan floor debate that opened Monday afternoon was one of the most significant in the history of the Senate. It is expected to continue for much of December, with supporters and opponents alike offering a raft of amendments as the White House and Democratic leaders seek to put together the 60-vote coalition necessary to win passage.

Administration officials continued to reach out to lawmakers in both parties to try to build support. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she met Monday for 45 minutes with Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, to discuss her concerns about the legislation.

In its report, the budget office compared estimates of premiums in 2016 under the new legislation and under current law. In either case, after seven years of inflation, premiums would be substantially higher than they are today.

The budget office said the analysis of premiums was extremely complex, so the experience of individuals and families "could vary significantly from the average.”

“In general,” it said, “the proposal would tend to increase premiums for people who are young and relatively healthy, and decrease premiums for those who are older and relatively unhealthy.”

Under the legislation, it said, the average premium per person in the individual insurance market would be 10 percent to 13 percent higher than under current law. But, it said, most people in this market — 18 million of the 32 million people buying insurance on their own — would qualify for federal subsidies, which would reduce their costs well below what they would have to pay under current law.

For people receiving subsidies, the budget office said, premiums would be 56 percent to 59 percent lower than under current law.

Without subsidies, it said, premiums under the bill would average $5,800 a year for individuals and $15,200 a year for families buying coverage on their own. Under current law, the comparable figures would be $5,500 and $13,100.

“This study indicates that, for most Americans, the bill will have a modestly positive impact on their premium costs,” Mr. Bayh said. “For the remainder, more will see their costs go down than up.”

Under the bill, the budget office said, individual policies would have to provide more benefits and pay a larger share of costs than most existing policies do. In other words, it said, some people would pay more, but would also get more.

Insurers, it said, would have to cover certain services that, in many cases, are not covered by existing policies in the individual insurance market. These include maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health services and substance abuse treatment. Moreover, it said, under the legislation, insurance would cover an average of 72 percent of medical costs for people buying insurance on their own, up from 60 percent under current law.

The budget office said it foresaw “smaller effects on premiums for employment-based coverage.”

In groups with 50 or fewer employees, it said, unsubsidized premiums in 2016 would average $7,800 a year for individuals and $19,200 for families — scarcely any different from the amounts expected under current law. Of the 25 million people receiving coverage from small businesses, it said, 3 million would qualify for subsidies, which would reduce their premiums by an average of 8 percent to 11 percent.

Large employers would generally not be eligible for such assistance. Their premiums in 2016 under the bill would average $7,300 for individual coverage and $20,100 for family coverage, the report said. Under current law, the comparable figures would be $7,400 for individual coverage and $20,300 for family coverage.

The Senate bill would impose an excise tax on high-premium health plans offered by employers. People who remain in such “Cadillac health plans” would pay higher premiums, but most people would avoid the effect of the tax by enrolling in plans with lower premiums, the budget office said.
35 2009-12-01 Mr. Huckabee commuted his sentence, making him eligible for immediate parole. Within six months, Mr. Clemmons violated the conditions of his parole, returning to prison in July 2001 for aggravated robbery. When he was paroled again by the state in 2004, the police in Little Rock served a warrant on him related to a 2001 robbery. But a lawyer for Mr. Clemmons argued that too much time had elapsed since the warrant was issued, and prosecutors dropped the charges.

Mr. Huckabee, who rode a brand of prairie populism to finish second in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008, granted more than 1,000 pardons or clemency requests as governor. As his reputation for granting clemency spread, more convicts applied. Aides said he read each file personally.

In most cases, he followed the recommendation of the parole board, but in several cases he overrode the objections of prosecutors, judges and victims’ families. And in several, he followed recommendations for clemency from Baptist preachers who had been longtime supporters.

Prosecutors told him he was ignoring his responsibility to explain to citizens why he was setting free convicted murderers and rapists. His response, some of them say, was to blame others and strike out against his critics — an off-note from a man they consider a gifted politician.

“Victims groups were pretty well ignored, along with boots-on-the-streets law enforcement and good citizens who sit on these juries,” said Larry Jegley, who objected to Mr. Clemmons’s clemency request as the prosecuting attorney for Pulaski County, where he was convicted.

Robert Herzfeld, then the prosecuting attorney of Saline County, wrote a letter to Governor Huckabee in January 2004, saying his policy on clemency was “fatally flawed” and suggesting that he should announce specific reasons for granting clemency. Mr. Huckabee’s chief aide on clemency wrote back: “The governor read your letter and laughed out loud. He wanted me to respond to you. I wish you success as you cut down on your caffeine consumption.”

“It was all a very personal issue for him,” said Mr. Herzfeld, who later sued successfully to overturn one of Mr. Huckabee’s clemency decisions, which would have set free a man convicted in a bludgeoning death. “It was always about how I was trying to get him or another prosecutor was trying to get him, not about how to do it right. He’s brilliant politically and very likable, but it seems like there’s a blind spot on this issue.”

With Mr. Clemmons, political consultants say Mr. Huckabee may have hit his Willie Horton moment

“As a front-runner, obviously with circumstances like this, it’s out there as a big issue,” said Ed Rollins, the manager of Mr. Huckabee’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Mr. Huckabee survived a similar moment before, during the caucuses, when former Gov. of criticized his judgment in the case of Wayne DuMond, a convicted rapist who raped and killed a woman 11 months after being paroled in Arkansas.

Mr. Huckabee said that he had opposed clemency, and that it had been his predecessor, , who had made Mr. DuMond eligible for parole by reducing his sentence. “If anyone needs to get a Willie Horton out of it, it’s Jim Guy Tucker and the Democrat Party and it ain’t me,” he said to reporters at the time.

But Mr. Huckabee had come into office saying he intended to commute Mr. DuMond’s sentence. He later denied the request only as the state’s board granted Mr. DuMond parole. Members of the board later said they had been pressured by the governor.

Mr. Clemmons’s case packs more potency: the facts of Mr. Huckabee’s involvement in the clemency decision are less in dispute, and the crime has played over and over on national television.

“It’s the same issue yet again,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “The difference this time is that Governor Huckabee would start with greater visibility and higher in the polls, which always enhances and exacerbates any possible criticisms.”

Should he run, there are many prosecutors and victims’ advocates in Arkansas who say they are ready to argue to the national news media that this is just one of the cases where Mr. Huckabee used poor judgment and ignored an inmate’s history of criminal behavior in deciding for clemency. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Huckabee declined requests for an interview, but a statement from the “press team” on the Web site of his political action committee said that should Mr. Clemmons be found responsible for the shootings, “it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and .”

“He was recommended for and received commutation of his original sentence from 1990,” the statement said. “This commutation made him parole-eligible and he was then paroled by the parole board once they determined he met the conditions at that time.”

On Sunday, before the shooting, Mr. Huckabee sounded ambivalent on Fox News about running for president, saying he liked his role at the network and wanted to be sure that, unlike in 2008, he would receive support from the Republican establishment.
36 2009-12-01 He was struggling to hire enough Shariah scholars, he said, and he needed them to bless the investments — apparently there was a shortage of properly trained Islamic scholars who did this kind of work.

With the benefit of hindsight — and you didn’t need much — there were plenty of other signs back then that Dubai was building a financial mirage in the desert.

With hours to kill before a late-night flight, I ventured over to the Ski Dubai indoor ski run. It’s a pretty good bet that a city with an average temperature of 90 degrees and an indoor ski slope is probably living a little too large. On one ride up the chairlift, I sat next to a 7-year-old from London who had just moved to town. With a big grin, he proudly told me that his father was in “the real estate business.”

For the last couple of years, the running joke on Wall Street was “Dubai, Mumbai, Shanghai or goodbye.” If you were the C.E.O. of a troubled investment bank desperately looking for cash, you made a pilgrimage to one of those three cities with hat in hand. They were the places most likely to write a quick billion-dollar check; their eagerness should have also been a tip-off. Now you have to wonder about Mumbai and Shanghai, too. Are they next in line to take a fall?

Willem Buiter, a former Bank of England official who was hired as chief economist of Citigroup on Monday, says that Dubai’s credit crisis is just the natural progression of “the massive build-up of sovereign debt as a result of the financial crisis.” He wrote on his blog on The Financial Times’s Web site that the contraction of credit “makes it all but inevitable that the final chapter of the crisis and its aftermath will involve sovereign default, perhaps dressed up as sovereign debt restructuring or even debt deferral.”

With all the money pouring into the region, it would have been hard for any doomsday types to make themselves heard. But there were whispers here and there, pointing out the obvious. David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the private equity giant Carlyle Group who was in Dubai at the conference, remarked to me at the time: “You know, they don’t have any oil here.”

That fact was overlooked by many investors who didn’t want to miss out on a quick buck. What about the risk? The view was, and apparently still is, that if Dubai gets in trouble, its oil-rich neighbors in Abu Dhabi will bail everyone out to avoid damage to their collective reputation and, by extension, the region’s economy. Just as the United States stood behind its banks, in part, to avoid losing the confidence of foreign investors, Abu Dhabi might have to do the same.

That had to be what Citigroup, with its firsthand expertise with bailouts, must have been thinking when it lent $8 billion to Dubai last year. Oh, and here’s an interesting fact: Citigroup made the loan to Dubai on Dec. 14, 2008. Take a look at the calendar — that’s after it received tens of billions in TARP funds. Citigroup’s chairman, Win Bischoff, said at the time, “This is in line with our commitment to the U.A.E. market in general, and reflects our positive outlook on Dubai in particular.” Good call. And what became of all those Shariah-compliant financial instruments that were the hot topic of that panel I attended? It turns out that many of them that were sold prior to the crisis weren’t compliant at all.

The Shariah Committee of the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Institutions, which is based in Bahrain, ended up changing the rules to make them stricter because of widespread abuse. As Mr. Buiter described them on his blog, “these were window-dressing pseudo-Islamic financial instruments that were mathematically equivalent to conventional debt and mortgage contracts.”

Blessings, alas, can do only so much.
37 2009-12-01 In June, Governor Paterson formed a task force to examine confrontations between on-duty and off-duty officers and the role that race may have played. The task force held its first public hearing on Nov. 17 in Albany; it is scheduled to convene in Harlem on Thursday.

The Police Department did a historical analysis of the 10 instances since 1930 in which an officer died because of mistaken identity and found no pattern in the racial makeup of the officers involved, according to the letter. (Eight of the 10 officers were off-duty when they were shot.) The department has retrained all of its officers on how to avoid mistaken-identity incidents, the letter said. And the department has also hired an expert to study the effect of racial bias on its officers, and to develop new training methods.

Some police officials said it was not surprising that so many undercover officers had had guns pointed at them by uniformed officers, because those in undercover work are supposed to appear to be criminals. Undercover officers assume false identities to blend in on the street and often buy drugs and guns. They are different from plainclothes officers, who do not pretend to be criminals.

“With each passing day, the officers become better at perfecting the art of playing the roles of criminals,” said Eugene O’Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “The consequence of the officers becoming so good at blending in is that they are more likely to be mistaken for real criminals.”

All officers are taught that if another officer pulls a weapon on them, they should not move. Undercover officers are even instructed that if they are apprehending a suspect, they should let the suspect go if they believe that doing so will prevent the other officer from firing. The officers are also taught to not reach for their badges or guns, and to not turn their backs.

Tom McKenna, a former detective who retired in 2000, said that officers once pulled guns on him while he was trying to arrest a suspect. He said he was off duty at the time and wearing street clothes.

“I heard the sirens of the police car so I knew they were coming,” Detective McKenna said, recalling the incident, which he said took place on the Upper East Side in 1996. “I didn’t move. Why would I move? Who the heck moves when a cop has a gun pointed at you?”

Mr. McKenna added, “It was a nonissue. I was a guy in civilian clothes with my gun out. I had my back to them so I didn’t move. I simply told them where my shield was and I put my gun down.”

The letter said that the department sought input from fraternal groups like the Guardians Society and the Hispanic Society. The groups offered 36 recommendations, including a new badge holder that the department is developing. It will be made with reflective material so a plainclothes officer can be identified in low light.

In July, the department hired Joshua Correll, a professor at the University of Chicago, who studies racial bias in police decisions. He tested all the recruits who entered the Police Academy in July to determine their levels of racial bias. The recruits are scheduled to be measured again on Dec. 18, to determine what effect academy training has had on “shoot/don’t shoot situations.”
38 2009-12-01 A warmhearted holiday-themed movie — with a dog, no less — showed no teeth on Sunday night against that other seasonal tradition: football. According to Nielsen’s estimates, NBC ranked first for the night with its “Sunday Night Football” coverage of the Pittsburgh Steelers playing the Baltimore Ravens. Preliminary overnight estimates show it drew more viewers than last week’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Chicago Bears, which averaged 17.3 million. CBS was second with “60 Minutes” (14.3 million), “The Amazing Race” (11.7 million) and “A Dog Named Christmas” (12.3 million). Best in show for ABC was “Desperate Housewives” (12.6 million), while Fox drew 9 million for “The Simpsons” and 8.5 million for “Family Guy.”
39 2009-12-01 Manufacturing and business activity in parts of the United States improved in November, data showed on Monday, keeping the economy on track for recovery, though continued weakness in the labor market will constrain growth, economists said.

Business activity in the Midwest and in New York City expanded more than anticipated in November, according to regional reports from the Institute for Supply Management.

“This is good news, and another statistic that supports the scenario that we’re clawing our way out of the abyss. This is clearly reflective of an economy, at least on the manufacturing side, that is starting to heal,” said Ned Riley, chief executive of Riley Asset Management in Boston.

“There’s optimism here that this will improve the outlook for manufacturers. The only question is, manufacturers can make the goods, but will consumers buy them?” he added.

The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer grew faster than anticipated in November, rising to 56.1, above the 50 mark that denotes expansion.
40 2009-12-01 Insiders said Abu Dhabi — which bailed out Dubai to the tune of $10 billion earlier this year — might be seeking greater economic or even political control over Dubai as the price of additional succor.

Dubai World said late on Monday it had begun initial discussions with banks to restructure $26 billion of debt. It said the negotiations were “proceeding on a constructive basis.”

“It is envisioned the restructuring process will be carried out in an equitable way for the overall benefit of all stakeholders,” Dubai World said.

It said the restructuring would apply only to Dubai World and some of its subsidiaries, including Nakheel World, its main real estate division.Meanwhile, details emerged on Monday suggesting that Dubai World’s announcement about its debt might have been a result of a game of chicken between the company and its creditors.

As if underscoring the difficult negotiations over rescheduling the debt, the Dubai government reiterated on Monday that it would not guarantee the debt.

Although investors knew that Dubai did not officially guarantee the company’s debt, the emirate does own Dubai World, and many here have counted on it to guarantee the entity’s debts in an emergency. Now that so much of the holdings of Dubai World, mostly real estate, have gone south, niceties like who is legally liable for those loans matter here like never before.

In negotiations with creditors, Dubai World has had one basic aim — to extend the maturity of its short-term debt that will be maturing soon — especially a $3.5 billion Islamic bond issue, or sukkok, payable on Dec. 14.

In the short term, Dubai World sought to postpone payments for six months. In the longer term, says a person involved in the negotiations who declined to be identified because of the delicacy of the matter, Dubai World wanted to extend the maturity of not just these bonds, but a large part of its debt by an additional five to seven years.

The company hopes that by then its real estate assets in particular will start to produce a stream of income that would allow it to make its debt payments.

To change the terms of its debt, Dubai needed its creditors to agree, more or less in unison, to reschedule the payments, a thorny task made all the more difficult given the current fear in global banking and the deep reluctance of banks to make concessions.

As negotiations became more heated in recent months, and as the economic situation in Dubai worsened, one or two banks even went so far as to insist on being paid before the bondholders, according to the person involved in the negotiations.

After Dubai World raised $5 billion from Abu Dhabi banks on Wednesday, it was in a position to pay the $3.5 billion to the holders of its Islamic bond by Dec. 14. Instead, the company decided to call a halt in payments to make clear to the holders of its debt that they had to work together or risk not being paid at all.

It was the high-finance equivalent of mutually assured destruction. For the bankers, not to be paid would raise the prospect of more write-downs at a time when the industry has absorbed more than a trillion dollars in losses related to bad mortgages and is still recovering.

But the maneuver was also risky for Dubai, jeopardizing its reputation as a sound credit risk. And in the end, it led to the debt crisis that is playing out here.

Some analysts say any announcement on restructuring the debt is unlikely to come soon. Much of the six-month stay that Dubai asked for on its payments of the $3.5 billion bond is likely to pass as Dubai and creditors hash out which assets can be sold to raise cash, how much of a restructuring fee should be paid to bankers and most crucially, how much more time Dubai will get.

Through June 2013, Dubai World owes about $27 billion to banks and bond holders. It is not clear which banks were so insistent upon being paid early, but according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, the three banks with the largest exposures to the United Arab Emirates as a whole are HSBC at $16 billion, Standard Chartered at $8 billion and Barclays at $4 billion.

Compounding this uncertainty was an announcement by Barclays Capital on Monday that the asset value of one of Dubai World’s prime commercial properties in London, the Adelphi building, had sunk below the level of its debt.

While there has been no halting of interest payments on the underlying debt, such a warning was expected to make it more difficult for Istithmar, Dubai World’s private equity fund, to sell Adelphi to raise cash. Istithmar bought Adelphi in late 2006 for about $621 million.

For all the uncertainty, few investors think Dubai World will default. The questions are really over how the debt repayment will take place, analysts said.

Analysts say Abu Dhabi has been unhappy with Dubai’s free-spending ways — and its strong trade links with Iran, which sits just across the gulf but is considered an enemy by most Sunni Arab states. The debt crisis could be a way for Abu Dhabi to demand greater control over Dubai, and perhaps the federation, whose president is Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Muhammad bin Zayed al-Nahyan, cut off a questioner last month when asked about tension between him and Dubai’s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.

“It’s now quite clear that there’s a political struggle going on,” said Christopher Davidson, a professor at Durham University in Britain. “This is a great opportunity for the political centralization they clearly want, and perhaps the only way to do that is through political brinksmanship.”

In the usually more tangible world of investments, it is still not clear where the mix of Dubai World’s assets and liabilities lies.

While its liabilities are known to be $59 billion, estimates of its assets are much more obscure. According to one person with a broad understanding of Dubai World’s balance sheet who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the matter, its assets are about $68 billion.

As Abdulrahman al-Saleh, general director of Dubai’s Department of Finance, said, neither Dubai nor Abu Dhabi is bound legally to guarantee the debt. That point was made in a prospectus for Nakheel that lays out numerous warnings, saying Nakheel has relied “upon capital contributions from the government of Dubai,” and, “There can be no assurance that these contributions will continue.”
41 2009-12-01 GENEVA — Switzerland’s political leaders faced a chorus of criticism at home and abroad on Monday over a ban on the construction of minarets that passed overwhelmingly by referendum on Sunday.

The ban has propelled the country to the forefront of a European debate on how far countries should go to assimilate Muslim immigrants and Islamic culture.

Government ministers trying to contain the fallout voiced shock and disappointment with the result, which the Swiss establishment newspaper Le Temps called a “brutal sign of hostility” to Muslims that was “inspired by fear, fantasy and ignorance.”

The country’s justice minister, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, said that the vote was not a rejection of the Muslim community, religion or culture, but that it reflected fears among the population.

With support for the ban from 57.5 percent of voters, however, ministers were forced to admit they had failed to quell popular anxieties about the impact of what right-wing parties have portrayed as “creeping Islamization.”
42 2009-12-01 Mr. Gibbs told reporters at the White House that Mr. Obama would discuss in the speech how he intended to pay for the plan — a major concern of his Democratic base — and would make clear that he had a time frame for winding down the American involvement in the war.

“This is not an open-ended commitment,” Mr. Gibbs said.

The administration was sending its special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, to Brussels on Tuesday to begin briefing NATO and European allies about the policy.

He will be joined at NATO headquarters there on Friday by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who will brief NATO foreign ministers in his capacity as the senior allied commander.

Before leaving for West Point on Tuesday, Mr. Obama will meet with more than two dozen Congressional leaders at the White House to discuss his plan. Mr. Obama spent much of Monday calling allied leaders.

He spoke for 40 minutes with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who signaled that France was not in a position to commit more troops. There are currently 3,750 French soldiers and 150 police officers in Afghanistan.

“He said France would stay at current troop levels for as long as it takes to stabilize Afghanistan,” said an official briefed on the exchange, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private diplomatic exchange.

Instead of troops, Mr. Sarkozy told Mr. Obama that France was putting its focus on a conference in London sponsored by Germany and Britain to rally support for Afghanistan, officials in Washington and France said.

The French defense minister, Hervé Morin, publicly confirmed the French position on Monday, saying, “There is no question for now of raising numbers.”

Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain said Monday that Britain would send 500 additional troops to Afghanistan in early December, raising the number of British troops there to 10,000.

The announcement was closely coordinated between the governments in London and Washington, the two largest troop providers in the 43-nation coalition fighting in Afghanistan. Mr. Brown spoke to Mr. Obama by video link after his announcement in the House of Commons.

Mr. Obama also called President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, and he met at the White House with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia.

Administration officials said that Mr. Obama in his speech would lower American ambitions for the rate of training Afghan soldiers and the national police, a position that could put him at odds with some senior lawmakers.

They have been pressing to expand and accelerate the training, to speed the day when Afghan forces could assume more security duties and American troops could begin to withdraw.

In his strategic assessment, General McChrystal called for increasing the Afghan Army and the national police force by a combined 400,000 people.

But after originally embracing this approach, administration officials had second thoughts, fearing that pursuing this goal would just churn out thousands of substandard recruits. An administration official said the focus now would be on producing somewhat fewer but better trained troops, as quickly as possible. The shift was reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the new plan, newly trained Afghan security forces will work with American or other allied forces at every level. General McChrystal recommended this requirement in his assessment to increase the quality of the Afghan force and “accelerate their ownership of Afghanistan’s security.”

A senior Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a plan that had not been formally announced, said Monday that the first additional troops would be thousands of Marines sent to opium-rich Helmand Province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of Afghanistan. The Marines will begin to arrive in the region in January, the official said, and will be followed by a steady flow of tens of thousands..

Most of the additional forces in the south will go to Kandahar Province, the Taliban heartland, where the United States is stretched thin and has very few troops in the province’s largest city, also called Kandahar. The Taliban are currently in control of large parts of the province and are contesting control of the city.

The Defense Department official said that the additional United States troops would be used to try to secure the city and then the region.

“With more forces we should be able to lock down the security in Kandahar and the surrounding areas of Kandahar,” the official said.

The official said that after the president’s speech, which will begin at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday in Afghanistan, General McChrystal would brief his commanders and then embark on a daylong fly-around to visit NATO military installations in the country — Kandahar in the south, Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, Bagram Air Base in the east and Herat in the west.
43 2009-12-01 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 34.92 points, or 0.34 percent, to 10,344.84, and the broader S.& P. 500-stock index rose 4.14 points, or 0.38 percent, 1,095.63. The Nasdaq was up 6.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,144.60.

But traders on Monday were also focused on Dubai, where Dubai World, the emirate’s investment arm, said last week that it would not be able to make on-time payments for some of its $59 billion in debt. By late in the day, a report that Dubai was working on restructuring its debt seemed to quiet some investor concerns.

Uri D. Landesman, head of global growth at ING, said investors saw danger in the potential ripple effects to other developing economies, even if American banks were not affected.

“What people are more concerned about are the other emerging-market situations like this that could impact global banks,” Mr. Landesman said. “This is still a very news-sensitive market.”

He called the retail numbers a “mixed bag,” but said there were signs of strength in consumer electronics sales.

Stephen Lewis, head of research at Monument Securities in London, said Dubai was not big enough to set off a chain of lasting repercussions outside the Middle East of the same magnitude as the crisis in September 2008, when the failure of Lehman Brothers heightened worries about all financial institutions.

Beyond Dubai, European investors are also worried about the possibility of default from countries like Greece, Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Britain. Low-rated corporate and sovereign bonds are being shunned by some investors.

European shares were down at the end of trading. The FTSE 100 in London, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX in Frankfurt were all down 1.1 percent.

In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average climbed 2.9 percent, recouping some of the losses it suffered Friday, when global market jitters over the news from Dubai spread to Asia.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 3.25 percent. Only Singapore dropped. The Straits Times index sagged more than 1 percent as the market, which was closed for a public holiday Friday, played catch-up with the broad declines at the end of last week.

Interest rates were steady. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 101 16/32, and the yield fell to 3.20 percent from 3.21 percent late Friday.

Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

45 2009-12-01 Mr. Huckabee commuted his sentence, making him eligible for immediate parole. Within six months, Mr. Clemmons violated the conditions of his parole, returning to prison in July 2001 for aggravated robbery. When he was paroled again by the state in 2004, the police in Little Rock served a warrant on him related to a 2001 robbery. But a lawyer for Mr. Clemmons argued that too much time had elapsed since the warrant was issued, and prosecutors dropped the charges.

Mr. Huckabee, who rode a brand of prairie populism to finish second in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008, granted more than 1,000 pardons or clemency requests as governor. As his reputation for granting clemency spread, more convicts applied. Aides said he read each file personally.

In most cases, he followed the recommendation of the parole board, but in several cases he overrode the objections of prosecutors, judges and victims’ families. And in several, he followed recommendations for clemency from Baptist preachers who had been longtime supporters.

Prosecutors told him he was ignoring his responsibility to explain to citizens why he was setting free convicted murderers and rapists. His response, some of them say, was to blame others and strike out against his critics — an off-note from a man they consider a gifted politician.

“Victims groups were pretty well ignored, along with boots-on-the-streets law enforcement and good citizens who sit on these juries,” said Larry Jegley, who objected to Mr. Clemmons’s clemency request as the prosecuting attorney for Pulaski County, where he was convicted.

Robert Herzfeld, then the prosecuting attorney of Saline County, wrote a letter to Governor Huckabee in January 2004, saying his policy on clemency was “fatally flawed” and suggesting that he should announce specific reasons for granting clemency. Mr. Huckabee’s chief aide on clemency wrote back: “The governor read your letter and laughed out loud. He wanted me to respond to you. I wish you success as you cut down on your caffeine consumption.”

“It was all a very personal issue for him,” said Mr. Herzfeld, who later sued successfully to overturn one of Mr. Huckabee’s clemency decisions, which would have set free a man convicted in a bludgeoning death. “It was always about how I was trying to get him or another prosecutor was trying to get him, not about how to do it right. He’s brilliant politically and very likable, but it seems like there’s a blind spot on this issue.”

With Mr. Clemmons, political consultants say Mr. Huckabee may have hit his Willie Horton moment

“As a front-runner, obviously with circumstances like this, it’s out there as a big issue,” said Ed Rollins, the manager of Mr. Huckabee’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Mr. Huckabee survived a similar moment before, during the caucuses, when former Gov. of criticized his judgment in the case of Wayne DuMond, a convicted rapist who raped and killed a woman 11 months after being paroled in Arkansas.

Mr. Huckabee said that he had opposed clemency, and that it had been his predecessor, , who had made Mr. DuMond eligible for parole by reducing his sentence. “If anyone needs to get a Willie Horton out of it, it’s Jim Guy Tucker and the Democrat Party and it ain’t me,” he said to reporters at the time.

But Mr. Huckabee had come into office saying he intended to commute Mr. DuMond’s sentence. He later denied the request only as the state’s board granted Mr. DuMond parole. Members of the board later said they had been pressured by the governor.

Mr. Clemmons’s case packs more potency: the facts of Mr. Huckabee’s involvement in the clemency decision are less in dispute, and the crime has played over and over on national television.

“It’s the same issue yet again,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “The difference this time is that Governor Huckabee would start with greater visibility and higher in the polls, which always enhances and exacerbates any possible criticisms.”

Should he run, there are many prosecutors and victims’ advocates in Arkansas who say they are ready to argue to the national news media that this is just one of the cases where Mr. Huckabee used poor judgment and ignored an inmate’s history of criminal behavior in deciding for clemency. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Huckabee declined requests for an interview, but a statement from the “press team” on the Web site of his political action committee said that should Mr. Clemmons be found responsible for the shootings, “it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and .”

“He was recommended for and received commutation of his original sentence from 1990,” the statement said. “This commutation made him parole-eligible and he was then paroled by the parole board once they determined he met the conditions at that time.”

On Sunday, before the shooting, Mr. Huckabee sounded ambivalent on Fox News about running for president, saying he liked his role at the network and wanted to be sure that, unlike in 2008, he would receive support from the Republican establishment.

69 2009-12-02 But Boyd could pay more than that. Combining with Station could allow Boyd to cut costs by at least $50 million annually, or about 5 percent of its current nongaming expenses. Discounted and taxed, those hypothetical savings would be worth more than $300 million today. That’s in addition to Station’s stand-alone value, so Boyd could afford to hand Station’s senior lenders a greater proportion of their money back.

Unsecured creditors with $2 billion of debt outstanding would probably lose most of their money in either case, but might eke out a little with Boyd thanks to the higher total valuation the deal would place on Station.

Boyd can’t jump in unless the Fertittas or Station’s creditors want it to. While family members might not welcome Boyd because they want to control the bankruptcy process, the lenders should — if only to make sure the Fertittas have competition and therefore an incentive to offer creditors a fair deal.

Dubai is guilty of encouraging a sovereign confusion. Until it fell on hard times, the emirate rarely distinguished between $26 billion of sovereign debt and the much riskier $50 billion or so owed by government-related entities, including Dubai World, whose repayment difficulties rocked global markets.

The sovereign finances of Dubai are no cause for alarm. Debt stands at 40 percent of gross domestic product, and the fiscal deficit in 2009 should only be 1.8 percent of G.D.P., according to an October prospectus from Dubai for $6 billion in new bonds. That money was raised without difficulty.

The government also has a reasonably diverse revenue stream. This year, 54 percent of the projected $9.1 billion intake is expected to come from visa, land and tourism fees, 19 percent from customs duties, and 9 percent from dividends paid by the Investment Corporation of Dubai, the investment vehicle that holds the Emirates airline and stakes in local banks and utilities. Revenues related to oil and gas should provide 14 percent.

Even with a weaker economic backdrop, there doesn’t seem to be a need for direct income taxes or an increase in the tiny corporate tax rate. Dubai won’t need to renege on its pledge to keep the Dubai International Financial Center free of tax until 2054.

Entities related to the government but not supported by it — especially Dubai World, which is weighed down by debt tied to questionable real estate projects — are less fortunate. Dubai’s finance minister is right to say investors should have drawn a clear line between the two.

But the government made that job harder by routinely including commercial revenue in public discussions of government finances. A year ago, officials said the emirate’s total debt burden was $80 billion — a sum that included both sovereign obligations and those of government-linked investment vehicles like Dubai World.

Next time there’s a gray area between government and private sector, maybe creditors will be more careful — and insist on officials being clearer, too.
70 2009-12-02 A team sometimes neglected by the news media, with a fan base that has long been feeble, was suddenly surrounded by cameras and reporters, all of them wanting in on the 0-17 train wreck that may soon be 0-18.

For the Nets, it is really nothing new. Yes, they did make the N.B.A. finals two years in a row, in 2002 and 2003, but they are used to generating headlines only when they trade away a star player, seek a new home in Brooklyn or attract an exotic billionaire — the Russian oligarch Mikhail D. Prokhorov— as their potential new owner.

Now they are attracting attention through outright ineptness. Maybe it is all in their DNA. In their four decades, they have played home games in New Jersey (Teaneck, Piscataway and East Rutherford) and on Long Island in New York (West Hempstead, Commack and Uniondale). Brooklyn, they hope, is next, in time for the 2012-13 season.

In their inaugural 1967-68 campaign, as the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association, they ended the season tied with the Kentucky Colonels for the final playoff berth. A circus booked the home-site Teaneck Armory on the scheduled date of a one-game playoff, and the game was shifted to Long Island’s Commack Arena.

When the teams arrived, they found the court in shambles. Floorboards were loose and baskets were not padded. Kentucky won through a forfeit.

Two seasons later, the A.B.A. awarded the newly named New York Nets the draft rights to a hometown center named Lew Alcindor. Alcindor, in turn, notified the N.B.A and the A.B.A that he would accept one sealed bid from each league. The N.B.A.’s Milwaukee Bucks bid higher than the Nets. Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, joined Milwaukee.

Julius Erving later became the Nets’ jewel, but he was sold to the Philadelphia 76ers for $3 million in 1976 after a contract dispute. It was just months after the N.B.A. and the A.B.A. merged.

In 1983, the Nets were having their best season since the merger when the famously restless Larry Brown decided to walk away from the Nets’ coaching job late in the season to take over at the University of Kansas. The Nets then lost in the first round of the playoffs.

There is more, much more, interspersed with fleeting moments of success, but for Vandeweghe and Thorn, all that really matters right now is the dreary present.

Vandeweghe plans to coach this season only, and with Prokhorov awaiting as the new owner, much could change next season, anyway. Helping Vandeweghe will be the veteran Del Harris, who is 72, has coached the Bucks, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets and will arrive on Thursday. (His hair is already white, so anything the Nets do will not make matters worse).

Vandeweghe will then coach his first game on Friday. Suitably, the opponent will be the Charlotte Bobcats, coached by none other than Brown. For that matter, Wednesday’s opponent, the Dallas Mavericks, has the former Nets star Jason Kidd in the backcourt.

Thorn, who built the Kidd-led teams that went to the finals and then pared payroll at the direction of the current owner, Bruce C. Ratner, talked bravely Tuesday of the “very good pieces” on the Nets that will make the team attractive for free agents at the end of the season.

But it is not clear who would want to join a team that may not win a game until who knows when. For the moment, the Nets are tied with two other N.B.A. teams that started a season 0-17. The 1988-89 Miami Heat ended up with 18 victories and did not make the playoffs for three more seasons. The 1998-99 Los Angeles Clippers notched only nine wins in a 50-game lockout-shortened season. They did not make the playoffs until 2005-6.

And if the Nets continue to lose every game? Well, the longest losing streak in N.B.A. history is the 23 games in a row the Denver Nuggets dropped in the 1997-98 season. During that skid, the reporter from The Rocky Mountain News who covered the team began every game story with one word: “Ka-ching!” Vandeweghe has his own word in mind: victory.
71 2009-12-02 Lawyers for a terrorism suspect who spent nearly five years in American government custody before being sent to Manhattan for prosecution in a civilian court have asked a judge to dismiss his indictment, saying that the authorities had violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial, a new court filing shows.

The suspect, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who faces charges of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was captured in Pakistan in 2004, held for two years in secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency and moved to the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2006.

During his detention, he has said, he was subjected to cruel interrogation techniques and was denied a lawyer.

“We respectfully submit that this case presents possibly the most unique and egregious example of a speedy trial violation in American jurisprudence to date,” Mr. Ghailani’s lawyers said in a document that was heavily censored because of its reliance on classified information.

Although Mr. Ghailani faces charges stemming from a terrorist act that predated the Sept. 11 attacks, his motion could foreshadow a key issue in the prosecution of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the professed organizer of the 9/11 plot, and four other Guantánamo detainees who were recently ordered sent to New York for trial.
72 2009-12-02 “I found that cocktail-wise, there was a lack of variety” during the day, said the Clover Club’s owner, Julie Reiner, whose trailblazing brunch is a favorite of brownstone dwellers as well as bartenders. “People focused on having a great bloody mary, but other than that, there wasn’t much.”

The shift in hours has been driven by both passion and necessity. “Everybody always talked about brunch as a reason to go drink early on Sunday,” said Phil Ward, owner of Mayahuel. “But most places I’ve ever been, they’ve never had anything I wanted to drink.” Mr. Ward conceded, however, that he had another motivation. “The more you’re open, the more profit you make.”

Establishing a brunch trade often requires a few new hires because most bartenders, like vampires, are not morning people. “My night staff, heaven forbid they should ever have to work brunch,” Ms. Reiner said, laughing.

The notion of sunrise tipples is an old one. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for a gentleman to begin his day with a bracer at a tavern. “You always read about these ‘eye-openers,’ ‘fog-cutters,’ ‘phlegm-cutters,’ ‘morning glories,’ ” said St. John Frizell, who owns Fort Defiance. “They were arguably more popular than cocktails at night.”

But as the 20th century rolled along, a stigma was attached to daytime drinking. Perhaps because of this, “eye-openers” are among the last classic drinks to be resurrected by the current cocktail renaissance. “It’s kind of the last frontier for cocktails,” Mr. Frizell said.

What makes a morning drink? The category can be divided into two families: the nutritional and the effervescent — these drinks either feed you or wake you up. The nutritional contain ingredients associated with breakfast, like eggs (the Ramos Gin Fizz), milk (Bourbon Milk Punch), coffee (Irish Coffee) or juice (the bloody mary). The wake-ups take on a dose of Champagne (the mimosa or French 75) or cava (used in Phil Ward’s Agridulce Royale), or just plain seltzer (as in the Italian Fizz — a Fernet-Branca and sweet vermouth mixture — at Prime Meats in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn). Otherwise, said Ms. Reiner, daytime drinks veer toward “lighter liquors,” like gin, or “lighter flavors,” like lemon juice.

As bar owners loosen their twilight image, so are their customers loosening their inhibitions. “They don’t feel that there is any taboo anymore,” said Tim Staehling, the general manager of The Hungry Cat, which also has a bar in Santa Barbara, Calif. “It’s ‘Bring it on.’ ”

While the revolution has begun, the old guard hangs in. Most bar owners admit that half their daytime drinks are bloody marys, although they offer three or four versions. The mimosa, though, has been blackballed. “The thing with a Champagne drink in the morning is the effervescence of the wine helps to clean out your mouth of that layer of gunk from the night before.” Mr. Frizell said. “When you add orange juice, you’re just adding a new layer of gunk.”
73 2009-12-02 LOS ANGELES — Long used to manageable property tax bills, California homeowners have been lamenting over the last few years that their assessments did not reflect the enormous slide in the value of so many homes here.

Now, for the first time in more than 30 years — since a law was enacted limiting the amount property taxes could rise — property tax bills will reflect negative price inflation, reducing most homeowners’ tax bills come January.

Under Proposition 13, the state’s signature ballot measure passed in 1978, property assessments were brought to 1975 levels and annual tax increases were capped at 2 percent. Exceptions were made, and values reset, for properties that were sold or those where the living area was increased.

In all but five years since Proposition 13 was passed, the annual increase was the maximum allowable 2 percent, according to the State Board of Equalization. The board’s preliminary estimate, based on the Consumer Price Index, set deflation at 0.237 percent, which translates to a decline in taxes owed of roughly $2.60 per $100,000 in assessed value for most homeowners.

Those homeowners whose property values have not fallen, or whose tax rates already reflected fallen value, will not receive an additional break.

Across the state, property tax bills have continued to rise over the past few years, even as the housing market has fallen precipitously. While homeowners will probably cheer, schools around the state, which are already facing a budget crisis, are likely to take another hit because some of their money comes from property tax revenues.
74 2009-12-02 “I wish I can tell you with some certainty it will work,” he said last Saturday in an interview. “I’m not sure it will. But I can tell you of the sincerity with which we are reaching out to colleagues to try to make this work.”

The overhaul of the financial regulatory system in Congress is a study of contrasts between Mr. Dodd and his counterpart in the House, Representative Barney Frank, who heads the House Financial Services Committee. The two lawmakers are both liberal Democrats from New England. For institutional and other reasons, each has embarked on a different course.

Mr. Frank has spent months skillfully maneuvering each chapter of complex and contentious legislation through a divided committee whose members have alliances with powerful and conflicting industries. In a recent interview, Mr. Frank said he expected the committee to complete its final vote on the final chapter of the legislation on Wednesday and take the entire package to the floor later in December.

In an interview last week, Mr. Frank said he had “no doubt” that the House would approve the legislation in December after three days of debate and consideration of about a dozen amendments. He said he hoped the House would substantially narrow or eliminate a provision approved by the committee over his objection that provided an exemption for many companies from the auditing procedures of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. And he said his biggest regret so far has been that the committee could not find a more effective way to regulate conflicts of interest at the credit rating agencies.

He expressed high praise for the work of the committee and said the legislation, if enacted into law, would represent “the most fundamental changes to the regulatory system in more than 60 years.”

“On the whole, we have put in place a plan that would make the last set of problems very unlikely to happen again,” Mr. Frank said. “We have addressed many of the most important problems that have been identified during the crisis.”

In the Senate, Mr. Dodd recently abandoned his strategy of trying to jam his legislation through the banking committee on a straight party-line vote after hearing doubts from members of both parties. Institutionally, it is more difficult for a senator to exert control than a representative because the rules and culture of the Senate make it much easier for just one member to derail or delay legislation.

“Because of the Senate rules, it is a lot harder to get this accomplished in the Senate than the House,” said Mr. Schumer, who spent 18 years in the House before moving across Capitol Hill.

Despite efforts to engage with the Republicans, Mr. Dodd was unable to earn any support from them. He also faced defections from some Democrats with ties to industry groups that have opposed the measure’s central provisions.

With Congress returning this week, the differing House and Senate approaches to legislation threaten to doom one of President Obama’s highest priorities unless compromises can be found quickly.

Mr. Dodd has had other problems. Facing a tough re-election battle in Connecticut and the distraction of also helping to lead the effort on health care, he proposed ambitious legislation that even many of his allies, including some within the administration, had said privately stood virtually no chance of adoption.

Senate officials say Mr. Dodd’s election difficulties — and the criticism of him by his opponents that he was too close to the industry — makes it difficult to strike compromises.

Mr. Frank said the politics of the situation had “to have an effect” on how Mr. Dodd approaches the legislation. Other lawmakers and Congressional aides said the situation gave him little room to reach compromises and weakened his hold on the Senate committee.

But Mr. Dodd, who has served in the Senate since 1981 after serving three terms in the House, said that the political battle in Connecticut had had no bearing on how he has approached the financial overhaul legislation.

“This is an historic moment,” Mr. Dodd said. “It is a huge undertaking. The idea that after many years, and nine elections later, that I would let the race up here tailor how I approach this legislation, is just wrong. We have a chance to get something truly meaningful accomplished. I appreciate everyone going through the usual rounds of political speculation. But it really has no real bearing.”

“Just look at the state I come from,” he added. “We have a large insurance industry. We have many people who live in the state who work on Wall Street and the financial services industry. We are home to many hedge funds. If I tried to cater to all these differing industries, I’d twist myself up like a pretzel.”
75 2009-12-02 The Washington National Opera said that it planned to mount fewer productions and had cut staff members to cope with economic challenges. In a news release the company, whose general director, Plácido Domingo, right, holds the same position with the Los Angeles Opera, said it would produce five main-stage operas in its 2010-11 season, down from six in 2009-10 and seven in 2008-9. The company also said it had eliminated eight positions in its business and artistic departments and had frozen salaries and suspended its retirement-plan contributions for employees. Additionally, employees will take a one-week furlough in the last week of the year, with additional rolling furloughs expected in the spring. The opera’s president, Kenneth R. Feinberg, said the company had achieved balanced budgets for two straight years, partly because of contributions from “a few exceptionally generous donors.”
76 2009-12-02 “What does this all mean?” Mr. Zuma asked in his address, broadcast on public television. “It means that we will be treating significantly larger numbers of H.I.V.-positive patients. It means that people will live longer and more fulfilling lives.”

Mr. Zuma’s emergence as the first South African president to seize center stage on AIDS comes with its own subplots. Just three years ago, he admitted while on trial for rape that he knowingly had had sex with a woman infected with H.I.V. without using a condom, saying he showered afterward to minimize his risk of infection. Though acquitted, his words became fodder for cartoonists and critics.

That tarnished personal record served as a backdrop to his speech Tuesday, as he rallied his fellow South Africans to learn their H.I.V. status, promised to get another H.I.V. test himself and urged the nation to “use condoms consistently and correctly during every sexual encounter.”

Harvard researchers estimated last year that the delay by Mr. Mbeki’s government in using antiretroviral drugs to prevent women from infecting their newborns earlier this decade led to the deaths of 35,000 babies, and that 330,000 people died prematurely for lack of treatment.

Despite Mr. Zuma’s break with Mr. Mbeki on AIDS, he has apparently rejected a rising public clamor here, even among some of his party’s allies, for an accounting of Mr. Mbeki’s culpability.

The Congress of South African Trade Unions said Monday that Mr. Mbeki should apologize to the nation for his failures in fighting an epidemic it has described as “destroying more lives than any invading army in history.” The Young Communist League has demanded that Mr. Mbeki be prosecuted for genocide.

Business Day, a newspaper, editorialized on Nov. 20 that a murder trial and cross-examination of witnesses offered the possibility of extracting some truth. “The prospect of having a bite at understanding the Mbeki madness beckons,” the paper wrote, “even if legal charges might not ultimately stick.”

Mr. Mbeki, asked in a rare interview with the newspaper The Sunday Independent published on Nov. 1 if he had any regrets about his nine years as president, made no mention of AIDS.

Mr. Zuma and his party clearly have no desire to open an inquiry into the government’s record on AIDS. Mr. Zuma was Mr. Mbeki’s deputy president until Mr. Mbeki fired him in 2005. And like virtually all the leaders of the African National Congress, Mr. Zuma did not publicly oppose Mr. Mbeki on AIDS.

In an article published Tuesday in The Star, a daily newspaper, Mr. Zuma defended the government’s record and said that under past presidents from his party, specifically mentioning Mr. Mbeki, the government had put in place “strategies to comprehensively deal with H.I.V./AIDS.” He argued that as the government seeks to do still more, “We should avoid being drawn into an agenda of blame and recrimination.”

Still, Mr. Zuma’s approach on Tuesday — to speak frankly to the nation about each individual’s responsibility to prevent the spread of AIDS by changing his or her sexual behavior and to lay out new policies on life-saving treatment — won him wide praise from the advocates who had despaired under Mr. Mbeki.

In another significant vote of confidence, Donald Gips, the American ambassador to South Africa, announced that the United States would give South Africa $120 million over the coming two years to help meet the growing demand for antiretroviral drugs. That comes on top of the $560 million the United States was already planning to give South Africa in the 2010 fiscal year to fight AIDS.

But South Africans may best remember Mr. Zuma’s speech for his embrace of those who have suffered because of the epidemic or been shunned by society and their families. Among those listening Tuesday at the Pretoria show grounds was the daughter of Gugu Dlamini, a woman stoned and stabbed to death in 1998 near Durban after she said on the radio that she was H.I.V. positive.

While Mr. Mbeki once said he had never known anyone who died of AIDS, Mr. Zuma offered his sympathy.

“To families looking after sick relatives, we wish you strength,” he said. “We understand what you are going through. To those who have lost their loved ones to the epidemic, we share your pain and extend our deepest condolences.”
77 2009-12-02 Protalix is close to filing its application for federal approval of the drug. The product, called taliglucerase alfa, could reach the market next year.

Although analysts viewed the deal as a validation of Protalix’s drug and its novel manufacturing process, shares of Protalix fell nearly 14 percent, to $8.51, apparently because investors were disappointed that Pfizer did not acquire the company. Pfizer’s shares rose nearly 4 percent, to $18.85.

Protalix makes proteins that serve as drugs in genetically engineered carrot cells that grow inside plastic bags. That is far less costly, it says, than the process used by most biotechnology companies, including Genzyme, which is to use genetically engineered hamster ovary cells growing in stainless steel tanks.

That will probably mean that Protalix’s taliglucerase will be cheaper than Cerezyme, though executives at Pfizer and Protalix declined to discuss the price on Tuesday.

Big pharmaceutical companies once tended to disregard rare diseases, preferring to develop blockbusters for common ailments like diabetes and high cholesterol. But with sales growth slowing and older blockbusters losing patent protection, the companies have become more willing, even eager, to sell specialized drugs.

“This is the first step in the pursuit of a formal strategy around orphan drugs and rare diseases,” David Simmons, president of Pfizer’s established products business unit, said in an interview.

While there might be few patients with each disease, he said, “collectively, it’s a very large patient population with a great unmet medical need.”

Besides, Genzyme has proved that even a drug for a rare disease can generate big sales if the price of the drug is high enough. Only about 5,700 people in the world are being treated with Cerezyme. But since the drug costs about $200,000 a patient each year, sales exceeded $1 billion last year.

Pfizer is not alone in pursuing treatments for rare diseases. In October, GlaxoSmithKline announced a deal with Prosensa, a Dutch company, to develop drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And in June, Novartis won approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell its drug Ilaris as a treatment for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome. Only about 300 Americans suffer from that syndrome, an inflammatory condition caused by a gene mutation.

Philip Nadeau, an analyst at Cowen & Company, called the entrance of Pfizer as a competitor a “modest negative” for Genzyme. However, Mr. Nadeau said, “even Pfizer’s marketing prowess is unlikely to relieve” safety concerns some doctors have about the Protalix drug. The main concern is that because it is produced in plant cells, taliglucerase may spur immune reactions in some patients.

Genzyme’s stock rose a bit less than 1 percent, to $51.11. The company announced Monday that it had resumed shipping some newly manufactured Cerezyme. Manufacturing had been shut down in June after a virus contaminated the company’s factory in Boston.

The shortfall left Genzyme vulnerable to Protalix and also to Shire, a British drug company that is also developing a drug for Gaucher disease. Because of the shortage, the Food and Drug Administration has been allowing some patients to use the Shire and Protalix drugs even though they have not been approved.

Gaucher disease is an enzyme deficiency that can cause an enlarged liver and spleen, anemia, frequent bleeding and bone weakness. All three drugs consist of the enzyme that people with Gaucher disease are missing.
78 2009-12-02 “He pressed Mr. Mottaki for clear information on what had happened and for a statement of Iranian intentions in respect of the five,” the office said in a statement.

Mr. Miliband also sought to quash speculation about the sailors’ motives.

“There’s certainly no suggestion of any malicious intent on the part of the five young people,” he said.

Britain belongs to a group of six nations, including the United States, that sponsored a demand by the United Nations nuclear watchdog last week for Iran to immediately freeze operations at a once-secret enrichment plant, prompting a furious response from Tehran, which said it would build 10 more plants..

In the past, Iran has used incidents at sea to humiliate the British.

In March 2007, the Revolutionary Guards arrested 15 British sailors and marines, accusing them of entering Iranian territorial waters. President Ahmadinejad ordered their release two weeks later, characterizing the gesture as a gift to the British.

But the episode caused profound embarrassment among government and naval leaders in Britain. British officials have sought to avoid comparisons between the incidents and to insist that the detention of the sailors should not be drawn into the nuclear debate.

“This is a human story of five young yachtsmen,” Mr. Miliband said Tuesday. “It’s got nothing to do with politics. It’s got nothing to do with the nuclear enrichment program.

“It’s a consular case, which is being treated as a consular case by the U.K., and I’m sure will be treated as a consular case by the Iranian authorities,” he said. “It has no relation to any other issue. On that basis, I hope it will be resolved in a speedy and professional manner.”

The yacht, owned by Sail Bahrain, a racing organization, was seized on its way to Dubai from Bahrain after it accidentally crossed into Iranian waters, British and racing officials said Monday. Sail Bahrain said in a statement that it “may have strayed inadvertently into Iranian waters” and was stopped by Iranian naval vessels.

Somewhere along the way, the crew members radioed for help because there was no wind for the sails and the vessel had mechanical problems, meaning “they had no means of propulsion,” , said Louay Habib, who works for the Dubai Offshore Sailing Club. The crew called for a tow but Mr. Habib said it apparently never arrived.

The five were said to be “safe and well,” the British Foreign Office said.

It was unclear why the British authorities had waited five days to publicly report the seizure of the boat.

Concerns about the five sailors have deepened because Iran often prosecutes foreigners accused of straying into its territory.

In mid-November, Iran said it was pursuing spying charges against three American travelers who accidentally crossed into the country over the summer as they hiked through the Iraqi region of Kurdistan. Despite pleas from the hikers’ parents and calls for their release from the White House, the hikers are still being held in Iran.

The five sailors were identified in British news reports as Oliver Smith, Sam Usher, Luke Porter, Oliver Young and David Bloomer.

80 2009-12-02 It's better to be Googled once than not at all. At least, that's what Senator John McCain may be saying now that he has been named the ''fastest-falling'' Google search this year, according to 2009 search trends released Tuesday by the company.   ...
81 2009-12-02 “I found that cocktail-wise, there was a lack of variety” during the day, said the Clover Club’s owner, Julie Reiner, whose trailblazing brunch is a favorite of brownstone dwellers as well as bartenders. “People focused on having a great bloody mary, but other than that, there wasn’t much.”

The shift in hours has been driven by both passion and necessity. “Everybody always talked about brunch as a reason to go drink early on Sunday,” said Phil Ward, owner of Mayahuel. “But most places I’ve ever been, they’ve never had anything I wanted to drink.” Mr. Ward conceded, however, that he had another motivation. “The more you’re open, the more profit you make.”

Establishing a brunch trade often requires a few new hires because most bartenders, like vampires, are not morning people. “My night staff, heaven forbid they should ever have to work brunch,” Ms. Reiner said, laughing.

The notion of sunrise tipples is an old one. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for a gentleman to begin his day with a bracer at a tavern. “You always read about these ‘eye-openers,’ ‘fog-cutters,’ ‘phlegm-cutters,’ ‘morning glories,’ ” said St. John Frizell, who owns Fort Defiance. “They were arguably more popular than cocktails at night.”

But as the 20th century rolled along, a stigma was attached to daytime drinking. Perhaps because of this, “eye-openers” are among the last classic drinks to be resurrected by the current cocktail renaissance. “It’s kind of the last frontier for cocktails,” Mr. Frizell said.

What makes a morning drink? The category can be divided into two families: the nutritional and the effervescent — these drinks either feed you or wake you up. The nutritional contain ingredients associated with breakfast, like eggs (the Ramos Gin Fizz), milk (Bourbon Milk Punch), coffee (Irish Coffee) or juice (the bloody mary). The wake-ups take on a dose of Champagne (the mimosa or French 75) or cava (used in Phil Ward’s Agridulce Royale), or just plain seltzer (as in the Italian Fizz — a Fernet-Branca and sweet vermouth mixture — at Prime Meats in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn). Otherwise, said Ms. Reiner, daytime drinks veer toward “lighter liquors,” like gin, or “lighter flavors,” like lemon juice.

As bar owners loosen their twilight image, so are their customers loosening their inhibitions. “They don’t feel that there is any taboo anymore,” said Tim Staehling, the general manager of The Hungry Cat, which also has a bar in Santa Barbara, Calif. “It’s ‘Bring it on.’ ”

While the revolution has begun, the old guard hangs in. Most bar owners admit that half their daytime drinks are bloody marys, although they offer three or four versions. The mimosa, though, has been blackballed. “The thing with a Champagne drink in the morning is the effervescence of the wine helps to clean out your mouth of that layer of gunk from the night before.” Mr. Frizell said. “When you add orange juice, you’re just adding a new layer of gunk.”

109 2009-12-03 Don Congdon, a literary agent who spotted the talent of Ray Bradbury early in both their careers and whose long list of celebrated authors also included William Styron, Jack Finney, Evan S. Connell, William L. Shirer and David Sedaris, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn Heights. He was 91.

The death was confirmed by his son, Michael.

Mr. Congdon, who started out as a messenger at a small New York agency, developed an enviable reputation as a skilled editor, tough negotiator and shrewd judge of talent. While still a young editor at Simon & Schuster, he tuned in to the early stories of Ray Bradbury, who became one of his first clients after he set up as a full-time literary agent in 1947.

In 1966 he caused a stir in the publishing world, and precipitated a celebrated lawsuit by Jacqueline Kennedy, when, after spirited bargaining, he sold Look magazine the serial rights to “The Death of a President,” William Manchester’s study of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, for more than $600,000.

The sum, staggering for the time, added to Mrs. Kennedy’s fears that the book would bring unwanted publicity to her family and delve too deeply into personal matters. She filed suit against Mr. Manchester, Look and Harper & Row, the book’s publisher, for breach of contract and sought an injunction to halt publication. After negotiating with Look and Harper & Row for changes in the magazine excerpts and the book, Mrs. Kennedy dropped her suit.

Donald Keith Congdon was born on Jan. 7, 1918, in Crawford, Pa. His father was a railroad worker and his mother ran the family’s boardinghouse, which the bank seized during the Depression.

With $8 in his pocket, Mr. Congdon moved to New York in 1935, when he was just out of high school, and found work with the Lurton Blassingame Literary Agency, where he delivered manuscripts to publishers in Midtown, picking up the rejects on return trips. By 1940 he was secretary to Mr. Blassingame, and had begun building his own list of authors.

111 2009-12-03 The study also found a sharp decline in enforcement of a section of the that prohibits electoral rules with discriminatory effects, from more than four cases a year under Mr. Clinton to fewer than two cases a year under Mr. Bush.

Joseph Rich, a civil rights lawyer who has been invited by Democrats to testify and was among those given an early copy of the report, said it provided hard data that the division was politicized in the Bush years.

The report “confirms the types of problems we have been discussing for several years, particularly with respect to the enforcement record of the Bush administration,” said Mr. Rich, who spent 37 years in the Civil Rights Division and led its voting rights section.

Republicans have signaled that they will use the hearing to accuse the Obama administration of politicizing the division in its own way. They are focusing on a decision to downgrade voter-intimidation charges stemming from an incident in the 2008 election in which two members of the New Black Panther Party stood outside a precinct in militia uniforms, one of them holding a night stick. The charges were brought in the final days of the Bush administration and were downgraded and partially dropped in May.

At Republicans’ request, the Justice Department’s internal ethics office opened an investigation into the decision, which is continuing. But in a joint statement on Wednesday, Representatives of and Frank R. Wolf of , both Republicans, accused the department of a “cover-up,” saying officials have refused to answer questions about it.

“If the Justice Department had any credible reason for dropping these charges, what do they have to hide by providing those answers to Congress?” Mr. Smith and Mr. Wolf asked. “The continued refusal of this administration to answer these simple questions is proof wrongful political considerations were behind the administration decision to drop charges against their political ally.”

Democrats and civil rights groups said the Republicans were seeking to distract from the new evidence. During the Bush years, such criticism was based on anecdotes and incomplete data. But a report released in January by the department’s inspector general, citing internal e-mail and personnel files, confirmed that political appointees sought to hire conservatives and block liberals for career positions, contrary to civil service laws.

Similarly, the new Government Accountability Office report presents comprehensive data that demonstrates a fall-off in certain kinds of civil rights enforcement during the Bush years.

The office also found that case files often had no information explaining why supervisors had decided to close cases, sometimes against the recommendation of career officials. In a companion report, it also found that six years of internal audits about the division’s case-tracking system were missing.

In a prepared opening statement, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, Thomas E. Perez, said the reports about hiring and enforcement activity “underscore the point that the division, in recent years, was not doing all that it could to fulfill our responsibility to enforce all the civil rights laws fairly and aggressively.”

Mr. Perez, who was confirmed in October, described a sharp uptick in enforcement activity across a range of civil rights matters since the Obama administration took office.

Republicans invited Grace Chung Becker, who was the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights at the end of the Bush administration under Attorney General , to testify alongside Mr. Rich.

Ms. Becker’s prepared statement emphasized that the division had set “new record highs” in the number of cases filed to assist non-English-speakers obtain access ballots in their own language and in the number of human trafficking cases.

She also said that in 2008 the section that handles employment discrimination cases filed the most lawsuits in its history.

Statistics from 2008 were not included in the new study. But Mr. Rich, who is generally critical of the Bush administration, agreed that the division’s enforcement and hiring improved under Mr. Mukasey and his team.
112 2009-12-03 In an extraordinarily personal debate, senator after senator cast aside the often mundane rhetoric of lawmaking and delved into the most intimate aspects of their lives: husbands, wives, siblings and religion.

A Jewish senator told of a gay friend who was disowned by his family and was taken in by Holocaust survivors all too familiar with the brute realities of discrimination. Black lawmakers evoked slavery and the fight for civil rights, recalling a not-so-distant time when the right to marry was still determined by skin color.

“Each of us here today has their own experiences with discrimination in their lives, their loved ones’ lives,” said Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan as she spoke about her grandparents who came to the United States to escape the Russian pogroms. Afterward, outside the chamber, Ms. Krueger wept and could barely speak. “I don’t tend to be particularly emotional in this town,” she said. “This is different.”

Of the lawmakers who spoke on the floor of the chamber, all but one declared their support for the same-sex marriage bill. Nearly all those who voted against the bill remained silent during the two-hour debate. And though the bill was defeated by a wide margin, many of the senators shared the kind of personal stories rarely heard in such a public venue.

Ms. Krueger recalled her brother, Peter, a gay man who died of AIDS in 1988. “The fate of tens of thousands of New Yorkers are in our hands right now,” she said. “You’re not always aware of that when you’re debating bills in here; you think of things more in the abstract.”

Saying he had never been so nervous before addressing his colleagues, Senator Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat, read off the names of states that once sold blacks into slavery. He drew a comparison between barring gays from marrying and the ban on interracial marriages that existed in many states until a Supreme Court decision in 1967.

“It was not until 1967 before my son could marry Senator Griffo’s daughter if he wanted to, or Senator Lanza’s family member,” said Mr. Adams, who is black, referring to Joseph A. Griffo and Andrew J. Lanza, white Republican senators who ultimately voted against the bill. “It was an abomination for interracial couples to fall in love; it would destroy the institution of marriage. This is exactly what we heard then.”

Nearly every senator who spoke confessed to a sense of anxiety. Thomas K. Duane, the bill’s lead sponsor and the Senate’s only openly gay member, appeared nearly overcome as he issued a final call for support. Mr. Duane, a Democrat from Manhattan, clasped his hands, almost as if in prayer.

“I want to thank you for your humor, your loss, your sadness, happiness; I want to thank you for letting me be angry when I needed to be,” he said. “I consider all of your offices a cry-appropriate zone; in my office the tissues are always out.”

That emotional candor spilled onto the floor debate. Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat from Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, described his recent marriage as “the most moving and powerful experience I’ve ever had” and lamented he could not extend it to the gay guests at his wedding.

Diane J. Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, toasted Mr. Duane and his longtime partner by confessing, “I will tell you, I’m over the age of 40 — and that’s all you’re going to get from me — but I’ve never been able to maintain a relationship of the length or quality of the kind Tom Duane and Louis have.”

Ms. Savino also provoked one of the few big laughs of the afternoon when she told of an encounter with a pedicab driver who asked why she supported same-sex marriage.

“Think about this,” she recalled telling the man. “We just met, you and I right here at this stoplight. You stuck your head in the window of my car. Do you know tomorrow we could go to City Hall, we could apply for a marriage license, and we could get married?” The man nodded yes. “Well,” Ms. Savino replied, “do you think we’re ready for that kind of commitment?”

“That’s really what this is about,” she continued. “We in government don’t determine the quality or worthiness of people’s relationships. If we did, we would not issue three-quarters of the marriage licenses we do.”

The lone opponent to speak in the chamber, Rubén Díaz Sr., a Democrat from the Bronx, invoked his own experiences as a minister to explain his vote, and rejected arguments from other senators that religion should not play a role in deciding who can legally marry in New York. “You should carry your Bible all the time,” Mr. Díaz said.

The bill’s defeat by a vote of 38 to 24 suggested that the speeches did little to influence the outcome. “People may say the debate sways them, but the truth of it is, it’s pretty much decided,” Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat who supported the bill, said before the proceedings began.
113 2009-12-03 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Black-tailed prairie dogs were denied protection under the Endangered Species Act on Wednesday after federal officials concluded the once prevalent species showed signs of rebounding.

Decades of poisoning, shootings, the plague and loss of habitat to agriculture are blamed for a drastic drop in prairie dog numbers since the early 1900s, from roughly one billion animals to an estimated 24 million today.

Black-tailed prairie dogs once occupied an estimated 50,000 square miles and ranged across at least 11 Central and Western states. Regarded by most farmers and ranchers as a nuisance, they are considered a keystone species among biologists. They are a primary food source for rare animals like the black-footed ferret and their abandoned burrows serve as nests for owls.

New threats may be emerging. The Environmental Protection Agency has approved the expanded use of a new prairie dog poison, Rozol, over objections from the Fish and Wildlife Service. Environmental groups such as the Audubon Society have sued to repeal the approval.

Joy Gober, a Fish and Wildlife biologist, said her agency’s concerns centered on the poison’s potential danger to predators, including black-footed ferrets and eagles. At least one bald eagle and two badgers have been killed by the poison, and more deaths have likely gone unreported.
114 2009-12-03 The National Football League on Wednesday announced that it would impose its most stringent rules to date on managing concussions, requiring players who exhibit any significant sign of concussion to be removed from a game or practice and be barred from returning the same day.

The league has maintained, despite widespread criticism, that it was safe to allow players to return to the field as soon as their symptoms were gone  even in the same game in which the injury occurred. It has not been uncommon for players to return, either after passing a sideline test or by not revealing their symptoms.

The announcement is the latest of several recent changes to how the N.F.L. handles concussions, and comes at a time when some of its most high-profile players are coping with head injuries, including the star quarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals.

The new rule was made in the wake of heightened scrutiny of the league’s approach to head injuries, outlined in a series of articles in The New York Times. At a Congressional hearing in October, the N.F.L. was criticized for its practices and research methods. Last week, the co-chairmen of the league’s committee on concussions resigned under fire, on the same day the league announced that players who sustain concussions could be cleared to return only by independent experts.

“This re-emphasizes the imperativeness of being extremely cautious when athletes complain of any symptoms relative to the head or brain,” said Dr. Joseph Maroon, the team neurosurgeon for the Steelers and a member of the N.F.L.’s committee on concussions. “I think there may be more players held out than before. I think the effect is going to be a positive one.”

The league’s former practice of allowing players to return when their concussion symptoms subside has been criticized for putting its players at risk. It is widely known that symptoms of a concussion can reappear hours or days after the injury, indicating that the player had not healed from the initial blow.

The culture of playing through brain injuries in the N.F.L. has also influenced younger players, for whom repeat concussions can be serious. Because the governing bodies at the college and high school levels do not have rules regarding concussion management, amateur players routinely return after concussions, even if they are evaluated by a doctor or athletic trainer.

The new rule, which will take effect in this week’s games, still allows players with some fleeting concussion symptoms to return to games.

Symptoms that require immediate removal include amnesia, poor balance and an abnormal neurological examination, whether or not those symptoms quickly subside. For symptoms like dizziness and headache, however, a player can return to the field unless they are “persistent,” the statement said.

“There has to be some discretion for medical professionals,” Dr. Maroon said. “There’s a difference between a fever of 99 that goes away and a fever of 105. I don’t think we’re going to take the occasional minor fever out of football. On every play there are traumatic experiences to the head. The question is one of degree.”

Dr. Elliot Pellman, a member of the league’s committee on concussions and the primary author of several published studies that defended the league’s more liberal return-to-play protocol, declined to comment on Wednesday’s rule change.

Disqualifying players with any significant concussion symptoms could backfire, experts have said. Players have been known to hide their symptoms from medical personnel to stay on the field, and knowing they will have no chance to return could only discourage them further.

In Wednesday’s statement, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell reasserted the players’ growing responsibility for concussion care.

“A critical element of managing concussions is candid reporting by players of their symptoms following an injury,” Mr. Goodell said. “Accordingly, players are to be encouraged to be candid with team medical staffs and fully disclose any signs or symptoms that may be associated with a concussion.”

In September, The New York Times obtained the results of a league-sponsored telephone survey that indicated that N.F.L. retirees were reporting diagnoses of dementia and other memory-related diseases at several times the rate in the national population. The finding corroborated several other studies that the league had disparaged, prompting the House Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on football brain injuries on Oct. 28 in which Mr. Goodell and the players union were criticized on the issue.

Beyond Roethlisberger and Warner, the running backs Clinton Portis of the Washington Redskins and Brian Westbrook of the Philadelphia Eagles have dealt with concussions in recent weeks, stoking the scrutiny of the league’s policies. Westbrook’s teammate DeSean Jackson sustained a concussion last week and may not play this weekend.

Dr. Thom Mayer, medical director of the players union, said that all independent experts who will work the sideline of every game have been identified and approved by him and Dr. Pellman. He added that there are four finalists to become the new chairman, all of whom have academic backgrounds with no prior connection to the N.F.L.

Wednesday’s rule change contradicts past recommendations by the N.F.L.’s committee. A paper published in the journal Neurosurgery in 2005  whose lead authors were Dr. Pellman and the co-chairmen who recently resigned, David Viano and Ira Casson  defended as safe the league’s practice of returning players after concussions.

“Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play,” the paper said. “Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season. The current decision-making of N.F.L. team physicians seems appropriate for return to the game after a concussion, when the player has become asymptomatic and does not have memory or cognitive problems.”

Despite criticism by experts that returning to play on the same day as a concussion was dangerous, dozens of N.F.L. players have done so.

Starting this week, they no longer will.

Dr. Maroon called the rule “another progressive step for the league in terms of player safety.” Asked why the league did not adopt the rule three years ago, when outside experts were calling for it, he said: “You can ask a lot of good questions. The important thing is it’s being done now.”
115 2009-12-03 “You didn’t lose one inch,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer told the lawyer for the owners, D. Kent Safriet. “All you lost was the right to touch the water. But the court here says you in effect have that right because you can walk right over it and get to the water.”

The new strip of land is as wide as 75 feet in places, and the public has access to it.

“If somebody wanted to put up a hot dog stand on this new land,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked, “would you have the right to tell them they can’t?”

Justice Breyer said the relevant law did protect the owners’ right to enjoy their land in peace, meaning they could at a minimum ban “a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at night.”

Justice Antonin Scalia found the middle ground, as it were. “You can have quiet hot dog stands during the daytime,” he said.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor added that even before the beach project, “a hot dog stand could have sat in the water.”

Justice Scalia suggested that the owners might have lost something of substantial value. “People pay a lot more money for beachfront homes,” he said, than they do for “a house behind the beach at Coney Island.”

Still, Justice Scalia added, the wider beach and the protection from erosion and hurricanes it provided had value, too. “I’m not sure it’s a bad deal,” he said.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that the owners might have more to fear than a lone hot dog vendor, wet or dry. “You could have televised spring-break parties in front of somebody’s house,” Justice Alito said.

Scott D. Makar, Florida’s solicitor general, said existing legislation would not permit that.

Justice Scalia said there was nothing to prevent such law and proposed a name for it: “the Spring-Break Act of 2010.”

Chief Justice Roberts went further, asking a lawyer for the federal government, appearing in support of the state, whether the state was free to build an amusement park on the land.

The lawyer, Edwin S. Kneedler, said Florida law would not allow that. “You maintain a right of view, a right against unreasonable interference,” he said of the affected property owners.

It is the Roberts court’s first major takings case. Kelo v. City of New London, a 2005 decision that allowed local governments to use the power of eminent domain to take private property for business development, was one of the Rehnquist court’s most controversial rulings.

Justice John Paul Stevens was absent on Wednesday, an indication that he had disqualified himself from the case. He owns an apartment in a beachfront building in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Justice Stevens wrote the majority decision in Kelo, which was decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Although there have been shifts in court personnel since then, his apparent disqualification raises the possibility of a 4-to-4 tie in the case heard Wednesday, Stop the Beach Renourishment v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, No. 08-1151.

A tie would automatically affirm the lower court’s decision, meaning the property owners would lose.
116 2009-12-03 Nearly 2,600 bodies have been discovered in single, unmarked graves and in mass graves throughout mountainous Indian-controlled Kashmir, a human rights group said Wednesday. More than a dozen Kashmiri rebel groups have been fighting for independence from India or for a union with Pakistan since 1989. Rights groups say more than 8,000 people have disappeared since the rebellion began and the groups have for years accused the government of killing innocent civilians as well as militants.

Researchers from the International People’s Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice, a rights group in Indian-held Kashmir, said they found the graves during a three-year survey that concluded last month. Indian officials have said in the past that many militants have been killed in fighting with security forces and that their bodies are often buried in unmarked graves. “We’re not saying who is in each grave,” said Angna Chatterji, one of the members of the rights group. “But we’re saying these are unnamed graves and it’s imperative to investigate the issue by an independent international body.”
117 2009-12-03 New York City’s storefront gates, like its fire escapes and stoops, are there but not quite there: the unnoticed wallpaper of New York at night. They have been battered by vandals and defaced by graffiti taggers. They have secured diamonds, handmade tortellini and other valuable commodities. They have provided the clattering soundtrack of dawn and dusk, the steel canvas of struggling artists, the most compelling evidence that the city does, indeed, sleep.

And now, on orders of the City Council, roll-down gates have joined the ranks of fatty foods and cigarette smoke: they have been legislated against, some right into extinction.

The Council voted on Monday to ban the kind of security gates that completely shield commercial storefront windows and doors from view  ones that resemble old-fashioned auto garage doors, with narrow horizontal slats that rise up like a steely sort of curtain  while permitting the kinds of gates common in suburban shopping malls that allow passers-by to see inside.

Along Court Street in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, a gentrifying commercial and residential strip in what remains an Italian stronghold, the gradual ban on solid gates  there are probably tens of thousands of them  was as well-received as a property tax hike. Not a single owner or manager who was interviewed was aware of the Council’s vote.

The head-scratching dismay expressed by Pyung Lim Lee upon learning that City Hall had taken a regulatory interest in the rickety old solid gate outside C.H. Plaza Dry Cleaners, 400 Court Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., 11231, was typical.

“If the government pays, then O.K.,” said Mr. Lee, the owner of the shop, who was not surprised to learn that the government would not, after all, be covering the cost of a new gate. “They make law, law, law, and people’s life is more difficult.”

Frank Caputo took a more nuanced approach. He is the owner of Caputo’s Fine Foods, a narrow little hub of homemade mozzarella and pastas, down the street from the church where Al Capone was married long ago. Since Caputo’s was opened by his parents in 1973, the shop has had two gates, both of them the solid, no-peeking-in type. “I was afraid that someone was going to break the glass,” said Mr. Caputo, 47.

He has had the second gate  a $4,000 model with an electric motor that allows him to turn a key or press a button to raise or lower it  for about two years, and he figured that by 2026, when the ban fully kicks in, he would need to replace it, anyway. “If they would have told me I had six months to replace it, I would have been upset,” Mr. Caputo said.

Council members said the bill, which passed 45 to 0, was intended to deter vandals from spraying graffiti on flat-surface gates, to help beautify neighborhoods and to give police officers and firefighters the ability to look inside in an emergency. The ban applies to numerous businesses, including banks, barber shops, beauty salons, health clinics, dry cleaners, dental offices and retail stores.

All businesses affected have until July 1, 2026, to install security gates that allow at least 70 percent of the area they cover to be visible. Any gates installed after July 1, 2011, must comply with the new requirements.

“We took great pains in this bill to make sure we balanced quality-of-life issues and graffiti eradication with the real-life financial challenges small businesses are facing in this recession,” said the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn. “That’s why the bill has a lengthy time frame.”

The city’s many storefronts, like their proprietors, have their own bedtime rituals. In the diamond district in Manhattan, many shops do not bother with roll-down gates: employees can be seen removing the jewelry, item by item, from the window displays, bound for parts unknown.

On one block of Court Street, the window of a barber shop with no gate afforded a full view inside (the old-fashioned cash register’s empty drawer left open and the bill holders up), but the insurance office next door seemed to contain more secrets, with a solid gate, marred by graffiti.

The metal gate covering G. Esposito & Sons’ pork store offered a peek inside, but what was visible just inside the door would probably attract only the most desperate sort of burglar: a giant apron-clad, wide-eyed piggy statue.
118 2009-12-03 ONE of the more intriguing cultural phenomena of the last decade was the wristwatch renaissance. Startlingly defiant in the face of cheaper-than-dirt digital technology that ran circles around even the most advanced watch works, men’s watches grew in size, price and stature in what seemed to be proportions similar to real estate. They inched toward 50 millimeters in diameter; they flaunted diamond bezels, tourbillion movements and complications galore; and they regularly cost $15,000 to $50,000.

So it hardly came as a surprise when sales of the deluxe beauties — tokens of the Wall Street bonus culture — stalled at the end of 2008 and have only begun to tiptoe back to life. What is surprising is how strong sales have been for watches that are less expensive and less flashy (but which can hardly be described as cheap or low-key).

“November was our biggest month ever,” said Stacie Orloff, the president of Bell & Ross North America, known for watches that resemble vintage military gauges. November’s sales, she said, were up 25 percent over November 2008 and 18 percent over 2007.

“Men are shopping for watches a lot more impulsively than you might expect,” said Tom Kalenderian, the men’s fashion director at Barneys New York. “Accessories are the simplest and fastest way to express your individuality, and for these guys a watch can do that in a way a business suit can’t.” And, he said, watch collecting is appealing to younger and younger men; Barneys has even begun a program of wristwatch trunk shows to introduce men to new lines and hard-to-find models.

What makes one watch a hit and another a miss is hard to pin down. But watch-watchers comment that models that are in equal measure sporty, classic and flashy, like the new Rolex Air-King with aggressive orange numbers, do just that.

“Men are buying watches that aren’t ostentatious but that do have a fresh new look," said Ruediger Albers, the president of Wempe. “I’d say the average price right now is about $5,000, so it’s easy to explain to the neighbors.”

Even watches that cost as much as $6,000, like TAG Heuer’s new special-edition Monaco automatic chronograph, manage to walk the fine line between yesterday and tomorrow to be a hot ticket today.
119 2009-12-03 But they also say Arkansas could have prevented his release by keeping in place a so-called no-bail warrant it had rescinded in July. Arkansas officials say that warrant became moot because it applied to fugitives and Mr. Clemmons was in custody in Washington. At Washington’s request, Arkansas issued a second warrant in October, but Washington officials say that warrant did not make clear that Arkansas wanted Mr. Clemmons held without bail.

The seemingly technical debate over bail has accompanied a louder political one surrounding Mr. Huckabee’s clemency policies. Shortly after the shooting, Mr. Huckabee, considered a front-runner for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, issued a statement blaming “a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington State” for Mr. Clemmons’s alleged recent crimes.

Matt DeCample, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, a Democrat, said Mr. Huckabee’s comments appeared to have ignited the overall debate and frustrated Ms. Gregoire, a Democrat.

“We fully understand her offense and outrage in this tragic time at the comments that a former governor of this state made about the law enforcement and judicial systems in Washington State,” Mr. DeCample said.

“Having said that,” Mr. DeCample added, shifting to the bail dispute, “every review that we’ve done here shows that Arkansas acted by the book, and we hope that after whatever review they conduct is completed, that the relationship between the correction systems in the two states will be maintained.”

Rhonda Sharp, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Community Correction, said its decision to remove the no-bail warrant was based in part on the fact that Washington authorities had placed Mr. Clemmons on unsupervised parole before his arrests this year.

“Prior to that he was doing fine,” Ms. Sharp said.

Ms. Sharp said Arkansas did not have any pending requests to transfer parolees to Washington, and it was not immediately clear what impact Ms. Gregoire’s decision would have. Washington is currently supervising 15 people originally paroled in Arkansas.

Ms. Gregoire told King 5 News on Wednesday that she was ordering a review of how the two states deal with parolees because she had “a major question” about “whether Arkansas is living up to its responsibilities.” The governor spoke after Washington corrections officials released e-mail messages showing their efforts to persuade Arkansas to require that Mr. Clemmons be kept in jail.

The authorities continued to make arrests in the case on Wednesday and are now holding six people accused of helping Mr. Clemmons flee from the police after the killings. One of the suspects, Darcus Allen, 38, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to violating the terms of his parole in Arkansas. He has yet to be charged in the Clemmons case.
120 2009-12-03 In hearings before the Ontario Labor Relations Board, Warren contends that the league fired him at least in part because of his activist stance, an action that is illegal under Ontario law. According to Tom Curry, his lead counsel, Warren is seeking reinstatement but no monetary damages beyond lost salary.

Warren was entitled to a severance package of roughly $250,000 if he had accepted his dismissal.

The agreement between the league and its officials expires at the end of the season.

The hearing Thursday is one of a series on the Warren case to be heard by the board. Three senior referees who will retire at the end of the season — Kerry Fraser, Dan Marouelli and Bill McCreary — have been subpoenaed to testify at a later date. They are expected to support Warren.

At the hearing, Warren’s lawyers will finish cross-examining Stephen Walkom, the N.H.L.’s referee supervisor who dismissed Warren, and Terry Gregson, who took over the supervisory job this season when Walkom returned to on-ice work.

The hearings are expected to continue through the winter.

An N.H.L. spokesman said no league executive would comment on the case while it was still before the board.

Documents entered into evidence before the board in previous hearings showed that the league had given Warren 18 of 22 evaluations that met expectations in 2003-4, three that exceeded expectations and only one that failed to meet them.

Evaluations of Warren’s performance during the 2005-6 season include “very solid N.H.L. standard — definitely knows the difference between a penalty and a battle” (Buffalo at Ottawa, April 8), and “solid judgment throughout” (Islanders at Montreal, March 28).

After Warren became a union vice president in 2006, he received negative evaluations.

The board also saw e-mail messages from 2006 and 2007 between Walkom and Colin Campbell, the N.H.L. vice president, in which they discussed firing Warren.

“Warren has to go,” Campbell wrote to Walkom in February 2007. “There must be a way to get rid of this guy. Is there a way we could track total minors called by referees this year?”

Walkom replied: “I think we have that data but it may work in his favor. That’s why I’m against data.”

Two N.H.L. referees have expressed differing views on whether Warren was a good official. In October, Paul Devorski, a 21-year veteran, said Warren was a “below-average skater” who “has no business being on N.H.L. ice.” But Fraser, a 30-year veteran, said Warren “was always in position,” had “good judgment” and was fired because “he was proactive as an executive on the union side.”

After those remarks appeared last month on a Canadian news Web site, the union barred its members from speaking on the issue.

Dave Newell, a longtime N.H.L. referee who served as president of the officials union in the 1980s and later became an assistant supervisor for the league, said his evaluations of Warren were “absolutely favorable.”

Newell, who was fired as an assistant supervisor by Walkom in 2006, said that Warren showed “impeccable judgment” on the ice. He said he believed that Warren was fired for his union work.

The hearings have also highlighted the differences between the N.H.L.’s methods for evaluating officials and the more stringent systems used by the N.F.L., N.B.A. and Major League Baseball.

In those leagues, evaluators grade every call. In the N.B.A., every call in every game — as many as 70,000 a season — are videotaped and graded.

But through 2004-5, N.H.L. referees were evaluated in only about 20 to 25 games a season.

After Walkom became supervisor in 2005, five of seven assistant supervisors were subsequently fired and not replaced, which led to still fewer evaluations.

Today, N.H.L. officials are evaluated about five times a season. Some of them say the small number makes it easier for the league to fire referees and linesmen it does not want to retain.

Warren has long been an advocate for more objective criteria in referee evaluations, and for more evaluations in general.

Should Warren win reinstatement, it would, he said, be “fantastic to referee again.” He added that he would run again for a position on the union board.
121 2009-12-03 “Ah ha ha!” Dr. Annese said, as he watched a computer-guided blade scrape the first shaving of gray matter from Mr. Molaison’s frozen brain. “One down, 2,499 more to go.”

Dr. Annese carefully dropped the shaving into fluid. The procedure is being shown live online: thebrainobservatory.ucsd.edu/hm_live.php.

“It’s just amazing that this one patient — this one person — would contribute so much historically to the early study of memory,” said Dr. Susumu Tonegawa, a professor of neuroscience at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at M.I.T. “And now his brain will be available” for future study.

Good fortune and very bad luck conspired to make Mr. Molaison one of science’s most valuable resources and most productive collaborators. Growing up in and around Hartford, he began to suffer seizures as a boy. The seizures grew worse after he was knocked to the ground by a bicycle rider, and by the time he was 27 they were so severe he consented to an experimental brain operation to relieve them.

His doctor, the prominent brain surgeon William Beecher Scoville, suctioned out two slug-sized slivers of tissue, one from each side of the brain. The operation controlled the seizures, but it soon became clear that the patient could not form new memories.

“He loved to converse, for example, but within 15 minutes he would tell you the same story three times, with same words and intonation, without remembering that he’d just told it,” said Suzanne Corkin, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied and followed Mr. Molaison in the last five decades of his life.

Each time he met a new acquaintance, each time he visited the corner store, each time he strolled around the block, it was as if for the first time.

Before H.M., scientists thought that memory was widely distributed throughout the brain, not dependent on any one area. But by testing Mr. Molaison, researchers in Montreal and Hartford soon established that the areas that were removed — in the medial temporal lobe, about an inch deep in the brain level with the ear — are critical to forming new memories. One organ, the hippocampus, is especially crucial and is now the object of intense study.

In a series of studies, Mr. Molaison soon altered forever the understanding of learning by demonstrating that a part of his memory was fully intact. A 1962 paper by Dr. Brenda Milner of the Montreal Neurological Institute described a landmark study in which she had Mr. Molaison try to trace a line between two five-point stars, one inside the other.

Each time he tried the experiment, it seemed to him an entirely new experience. Yet he gradually became more proficient — showing that there are at least two systems in the brain for memory, one for events and facts and another for implicit or motor learning, for things like playing a guitar or riding a bicycle.

In the new brain-mapping project here, set to catalog many donated brains, scientists will have the ability to study areas of Mr. Molaison’s brain at a level of detail that imaging cannot reveal, to solve lingering mysteries about the man and the brain.

Mr. Molaison stunned researchers several times, for instance, by demonstrating that he could hold onto some new memories. He could reproduce exactly the floor map of his house on Crescent Drive in East Hartford, where he lived for years after his operation with his parents.

These and other scattered surprises suggest that Mr. Molaison’s brain, deprived of its central memory hub, recruited other nearby areas to try to compensate, scientists say. Now researchers can begin to study these poorly understood areas more closely. One region, called the parahippocampal cortex, appears to support “familiarity” memory, the sensation that we have seen or heard something before, though we cannot place it.

“We’ve learned a lot about memory, we’re getting close to the fire, and H.M.’s brain will really help us clarify the division of labor in this area for making memories,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a neuroscientist at New York University.

The dissection, a novel whole-brain technique, is part of a project known as the Brain Observatory and the culmination of a year of frantic preparation. Dr. Corkin arranged for Mr. Molaison’s brain to be preserved and imaged; up until Sunday the laboratory was tweaking its equipment, buying surfboard leashes at the last minute to support some of its freezing hoses.

“We hope that this project as it grows will catalyze cooperation across many disciplines” to study disorders like amnesia, tremors, and dementias, Dr. Annese said. “But we wanted to kick it off with the most famous brain of them all.”
122 2009-12-03 WASHINGTON — Under pressure from Democrats in Congress, the Obama administration has begun talks with lawmakers about tapping unspent money from the government’s financial bailout program to help offset additional spending to create jobs and aid the long-term unemployed.

The discussions reflect the Democrats’ effort to balance concerns for the high federal budget deficit and a costly, crowded domestic agenda, including an effort for further economic stimulus measures that is likely to exceed $100 billion. On Thursday, House leaders may decide the outlines of a jobs bill to pass this month, even as President Obama holds a White House jobs summit seeking long-range ideas.

Now that the financial industry has stabilized, and some bailed-out companies have repaid the government with interest, the $700 billion bailout fund created in October 2008 is left with a balance exceeding $200 billion, according to the Treasury.

Because of accounting rules, at most half of that amount is available for reprogramming, officials in Congress and the administration say. Many Democrats are eager to apply any balance toward a jobs bill, to avoid adding to the deficit and to put the widely reviled bank bailout program — known as TARP, for Troubled Asset Relief Program — to use for ordinary Americans.

Even at about $100 billion, the remaining TARP money would not cover much more than the estimated $85 billion cost of extending for another year the emergency federal compensation benefits for the longtime unemployed, as Democrats plan to do. Extending a provision subsidizing unemployed workers’ purchase of Cobra health benefits would cost another $15 billion. But Democrats are also considering additional infrastructure spending and business tax credits to spur hiring.
123 2009-12-03 It also coincides with fears that Britain’s model of relatively light regulation is in retreat — a sentiment increased by the appointment of a Frenchman, Michel Barnier, as the European internal market commissioner, whose portfolio includes financial regulation.

The agreement removed the threat that Britain would seek to block the measures, which were a central element of the European Union’s reaction to the financial crisis.

Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, praised the deal and said that ministers were “in the process of creating a real European authority.”

Alistair Darling, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the move brought benefits for Britain and underscored the fact that “responsibility lies with national regulators.”

The proposed legislation says that European authorities should not impinge in any way on the fiscal responsibilities of the national governments. The deal Wednesday spelled out what would happen if that stipulation were disputed, and how a government would appeal a decision from European supervisory authorities.

If such an appeal took place after European finance ministers had agreed that a financial crisis was under way, it would be considered by finance ministers initially, but it could then go to European Union leaders. Under the bloc’s procedures, that would ultimately give every country a veto.

If there were no crisis under way, a national government could still appeal, but — in a concession made by Britain — would no longer have a veto. It would have to persuade a majority of the European Union finance ministers to back its case.

Mr. Darling said Britain supported the new financial framework because it would improve cooperation between financial supervisors and help prevent a repeat of Iceland’s banking crisis, which spilled over into Britain.

The legislation now goes to the European Parliament, where several political groups have already criticized the compromise.

“Member states are repeatedly saying they want a single market for financial services,” Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Wednesday.

“Now that the time has come to agree on the basic principle of creating supra-national supervisory authorities, some of them appear totally reluctant,” he said.
124 2009-12-03 Business owners, though, have a more complicated relationship with the team. Many of them profit from the Bills and feel the pinch when home games are moved. Yet they sympathize with the team, which says that playing a few games in Toronto will ensure that it remains here.

Indeed, Rogers Communications, Canada’s largest wireless company and the owner of Rogers Centre, paid the Bills $78 million to play three preseason and five regular-season games in Toronto. That is twice the team’s operating income last year, according to Forbes.

Russ Brandon, the Bills’ chief operating officer, declined to say how they used the money. They do not have much debt, and they have a favorable lease with Erie County, which reimburses the team for some of the expenses of maintaining the stadium.

But the Bills, who play in one of the N.F.L.’s smallest television markets, feel pressure to keep up with the Cowboys, the Giants and the Jets, and other teams whose new stadiums will generate more revenue and the wherewithal to sign top players and coaches.

“We’re a small-market franchise and we compete with 31 other clubs, so you have to find ways to compete,” Brandon said. “With the demographic and economic challenges we face, we have to think outside the framework.”

The Bills have looked afar before. The team moved its training camp to Rochester in 2000, which led to a flood of season-ticket holders from fans east of Buffalo.

Playing games in Canada was the next logical step. Even before the Bills’ first two games in Toronto last season, Canadians bought about 15 percent of the tickets in Orchard Park. Thanks to the strong Canadian dollar, Bills fans from north of the border are among the biggest spenders when they travel here.

Showcasing the team in Canada seems to have worked. The number of season-ticket holders from Canada rose 48 percent this year. As a result, the Bills sold more than 55,000 season tickets, their third-best total ever. Overall ticket sales have dipped only 1.5 percent, despite the recession.

The games in Toronto dovetail with the N.F.L.’s goal of internationalizing the league to increase merchandise sales, television revenue and sponsorships. Along with the games in Canada, the N.F.L. has played regular-season games in London, Mexico City and Tokyo.

“The goal was to grow the N.F.L.,” said Mark Waller, the league’s chief marketing officer, who said that winning over fans in Canada is a long-term proposition. “It is not about moving the franchise.”

But Waller added that losing one or two of a limited supply of home games could harm local businesses that were stung by the economic downturn and the team’s poor play. The Bills are at the bottom of their division this year and have not made the playoffs since 1999.

“For my business it hurts, and the hurt could be a sideswipe or a big hit depending on which team the Bills play in Canada,” said David Hart, the president of Hart Hotels, which has six hotels in western New York. “Once you get an overnight accommodation, you trigger a whole bunch of other spending.”

Visiting teams, Hart and other hoteliers say, typically reserve about 100 rooms for their players, coaches and executives for one and sometimes two nights. The players are big eaters, so business is often good at the hotel’s restaurants. Thousands of out-of-town fans stream in, especially when the Bills play the Browns, Jets or Steelers.

The visitors generate money for the city by paying a 5 percent bed tax and an 8.75 percent sales tax. In all, the Bills produce $141 million annually in economic activity, according to estimates cited by Mayor Byron W. Brown of Buffalo.

Based on huge piles of empty cans strewn across parking lots near the stadium, beer sales also take a hit when the Buffalo area loses a game. During a typical Bills home game, Try-It Distributing, which controls 80 percent of the pouring rights in the stadium, sells about 400 cases of 16-ounce cans and 200 kegs of beer.

“We understand it: how many millions can you make in Buffalo?” said Paul Vukelic, the company’s president. “To us, it’s one less home game with less beer and no tailgating, so it definitely affects us.”

Property owners who charge for parking cars on their lawns and empty lots also lose income. Dennis Zimny uses the money he earns from his 20 parking spots at $10 each to pay most of his school and county taxes.

Limousine companies also lose out. Dave Irwin, the owner of Advantage Limousine in Buffalo, said his business had picked up because of the enforcement of drunken-driving laws. For each home game, he often rents seven of his dozen limousines for up to $650 apiece; that income makes up to 15 percent of his company’s annual revenue.

“The long and short of it is, it doesn’t help when they pull a game out,” he said.

Lisa Gilpatrick faces the same problem. She and three co-workers have sold hats, T-shirts and other N.F.L. garb at a stand in front of the stadium for the past 15 years. Last Sunday, she sold three dozen buffalo head hats at $12 each and hundreds of other items.

“It means a lot of money lost to Toronto, and our workers don’t get paid,” she said.

While the Bills seek a financial boost in Toronto, their Canadian fans seem to prefer that the team keep all of its home games at home. Tickets for the Bills games in Toronto are more expensive than they are here. Food and beer are also more expensive, and the rules on tailgating are more onerous.

Cindy McInally, a longtime season-ticket holder from Simcoe, Ontario, was typical of many Canadian fans. She and 20 of her friends and relatives spent about $300 on pizzas, chicken wings, chips, beer and other drinks at Wegmans. The 90-minute drive, the tailgating and the chance to see the Bills play in their real home were the attraction, not the game alone.

“The Bills games are quite an event, and they’re reasonably priced,” she said. “We much prefer they stay here.”
125 2009-12-03 Apple’s reconfigured iMac desktop — a shiny wide-screen example of a home computer — works beautifully ...unless it doesn’t work at all, or arrives with a cracked display.

Some reviewers and, judging from a survey of some Mac forums, some users are encountering issues with some new models.

The review team at Engadget, for example, found that their new Intel Core i7-based iMac would not boot up. (The 2.8-gigahertz Core i7 processor is sold as a $200 built-to-order option, and isn’t generally offered on machines sold at Apple retail stores.)

And TechNews.AM reports that some customers who ordered the Intel Core i7 got cracked display screens, often with the damage near the bottom left corner, suggesting inadequate shipping packaging.

This may give pause to some consumers who have been eyeing the iMac’s gorgeous LED-lighted display and searingly fast processor, although Apple is replacing the products. STEPHEN WILLIAMS
126 2009-12-03 MANILA — Imelda Marcos, the flamboyant widow of the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, filed last-minute papers on Tuesday declaring her candidacy for a seat in the Philippine Congress next year.

Mrs. Marcos, 80, served in Congress once before, in the 1990s, representing the province where she grew up, Leyte. This time, she aims to represent the province of Ilocos Norte, the Marcos family’s stronghold in the northern Philippines.

Her son, Ferdinand E. Marcos Jr., is vacating his congressional seat there to run for senator, and a daughter, Imee, is running for governor. Mrs. Marcos’s papers were filed in Ilocos Norte about an hour before the deadline at midnight on Tuesday, her spokeswoman, Sol Vanzi, told Agence France-Presse.

The elections, scheduled for May, promise to offer more than one notable candidate. The filing came a day after Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the deeply unpopular Philippine president whose term ends in June, announced her own candidacy for Congress. She aims to represent her home district in Pampanga Province, just north of Manila. She is the first Philippine president to seek lower office.

The Marcos family, deposed and publicly humiliated during the first People Power revolt in the Philippines in 1986, never disappeared completely from the public eye.
127 2009-12-03 COULD fat injected into the breast spur an undetected cancer’s growth? At a recent meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Ali Mojallal, an assistant professor of plastic surgery at the University of Lyon, France, raised this question.

Plastic surgeons have long worried that fat injections to the breast could make mammograms trickier to read, but Dr. Mojallal’s concern is that research using animals has shown that tumors grow faster and are more likely to spread if they’re near fat. “I would not inject fat into the breast,” he said in a phone interview. “If my patient one or two years later had a tumor in her breast, I have no way to prove there’s no correlation.”

In 2007, the French Society of Plastic Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery banned its members from doing the procedure until further research is done, except in certain cases such as patients who have had their breasts reconstructed after mastectomies.

Dr. Mojallal, who also teaches at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, added: “Nobody is talking about this in American society. It’s really amazing.”

At the moment, the argument is “very theoretical,” said Dr. Scott L. Spear, the chairman of the plastic surgery department at Georgetown University Hospital. “Personally I think it’s very unlikely that it will cause cancer.”

Doctors have transplanted fat all over the body for 15 years, he added. “We aren’t seeing cancers develop.”
128 2009-12-03 The National Institutes of Health said Wednesday that it had approved 13 new human embryonic stem cell lines for use by federally financed researchers, with 96 more under review.

The action followed President Obama’s decision in March to expand the number of such cell lines beyond those available under a policy set by President George W. Bush, which permitted research to begin only with lines already available on Aug. 9, 2001.

Since that date, biomedical researchers supported by the N.I.H. have had to raise private money to derive the cells, which are obtained from the fertilized embryos left over from in vitro fertility clinics.

With federal money banned from being used in any part of the work on the derived lines, researchers had to divide their laboratories and go to extreme lengths to separate research materials based on the financing source.

“You can imagine what it meant not to be able to carry a pipette from one room to another,” said Ali H. Brivanlou, a researcher at Rockefeller University. “They even had to repaint the walls to ensure no contamination by federal funds.”
129 2009-12-03 Mr. Geithner said at the Nov. 19 hearing that “substantial resources” remaining in the TARP fund would be used to pay down the national debt, which is being pushed higher by record deficits including a $1.42 billion imbalance for the budget year that ended Sept. 30. Even hundreds of billions of dollars would be a fraction of the $12 trillion debt, but it could lessen political unhappiness if portions of the bailout program are allowed to continue.

With regard to derivatives, the complex instruments blamed for hastening the financial crisis, some lawmakers want to exempt companies that use them to hedge against risk from new requirements in the overhaul legislation.

A potent coalition of about 170 so-called end-user companies — including the Boeing Company, Caterpillar, the Ford Motor Company, the General Electric Company and the Shell Oil Company — has been lobbying Congress with the message that regulation of derivatives without exceptions could severely increase costs for corporations. That could mean higher costs passed on to consumers and imperiled jobs, they contend.

“Many end users have told me this would add considerable costs and would likely be passed along to consumers,” said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the committee’s senior Republican.

Mr. Geithner said exemptions should apply to a “limited number of nonfinancial companies ... people that are making things and selling things across the country.”

The value of derivatives hinges on an underlying investment or commodity — such as currency rates, oil futures or interest rates. The derivative is designed to reduce the risk of loss from the underlying asset.

Credit default swaps, a form of insurance against loan defaults, account for an estimated $60 trillion of the worldwide derivatives market. The collapse of the swaps brought the downfall of Wall Street banking house Lehman Brothers and nearly toppled American International Group last year at the height of the crisis, spurring the government to support the insurance conglomerate with about $180 billion in aid.

The administration’s proposal is close to the legislation in the House, requiring most derivatives trades to go through clearinghouses to bring transparency, and subjecting financial firms dealing in the instruments to new capital requirements.

All derivatives contracts that are “liquid and standardized” — backed with cash and not designed for specific users in a transaction — should go through well-regulated clearinghouses, Mr. Geithner said. There should be a presumption that a contract accepted for clearing by one of the houses and approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission must be centrally cleared.
130 2009-12-03 In an extraordinarily personal debate, senator after senator cast aside the often mundane rhetoric of lawmaking and delved into the most intimate aspects of their lives: husbands, wives, siblings and religion.

A Jewish senator told of a gay friend who was disowned by his family and was taken in by Holocaust survivors all too familiar with the brute realities of discrimination. Black lawmakers evoked slavery and the fight for civil rights, recalling a not-so-distant time when the right to marry was still determined by skin color.

“Each of us here today has their own experiences with discrimination in their lives, their loved ones’ lives,” said Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan as she spoke about her grandparents who came to the United States to escape the Russian pogroms. Afterward, outside the chamber, Ms. Krueger wept and could barely speak. “I don’t tend to be particularly emotional in this town,” she said. “This is different.”

Of the lawmakers who spoke on the floor of the chamber, all but one declared their support for the same-sex marriage bill. Nearly all those who voted against the bill remained silent during the two-hour debate. And though the bill was defeated by a wide margin, many of the senators shared the kind of personal stories rarely heard in such a public venue.

Ms. Krueger recalled her brother, Peter, a gay man who died of AIDS in 1988. “The fate of tens of thousands of New Yorkers are in our hands right now,” she said. “You’re not always aware of that when you’re debating bills in here; you think of things more in the abstract.”

Saying he had never been so nervous before addressing his colleagues, Senator Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat, read off the names of states that once sold blacks into slavery. He drew a comparison between barring gays from marrying and the ban on interracial marriages that existed in many states until a Supreme Court decision in 1967.

“It was not until 1967 before my son could marry Senator Griffo’s daughter if he wanted to, or Senator Lanza’s family member,” said Mr. Adams, who is black, referring to Joseph A. Griffo and Andrew J. Lanza, white Republican senators who ultimately voted against the bill. “It was an abomination for interracial couples to fall in love; it would destroy the institution of marriage. This is exactly what we heard then.”

Nearly every senator who spoke confessed to a sense of anxiety. Thomas K. Duane, the bill’s lead sponsor and the Senate’s only openly gay member, appeared nearly overcome as he issued a final call for support. Mr. Duane, a Democrat from Manhattan, clasped his hands, almost as if in prayer.

“I want to thank you for your humor, your loss, your sadness, happiness; I want to thank you for letting me be angry when I needed to be,” he said. “I consider all of your offices a cry-appropriate zone; in my office the tissues are always out.”

That emotional candor spilled onto the floor debate. Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat from Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, described his recent marriage as “the most moving and powerful experience I’ve ever had” and lamented he could not extend it to the gay guests at his wedding.

Diane J. Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, toasted Mr. Duane and his longtime partner by confessing, “I will tell you, I’m over the age of 40 — and that’s all you’re going to get from me — but I’ve never been able to maintain a relationship of the length or quality of the kind Tom Duane and Louis have.”

Ms. Savino also provoked one of the few big laughs of the afternoon when she told of an encounter with a pedicab driver who asked why she supported same-sex marriage.

“Think about this,” she recalled telling the man. “We just met, you and I right here at this stoplight. You stuck your head in the window of my car. Do you know tomorrow we could go to City Hall, we could apply for a marriage license, and we could get married?” The man nodded yes. “Well,” Ms. Savino replied, “do you think we’re ready for that kind of commitment?”

“That’s really what this is about,” she continued. “We in government don’t determine the quality or worthiness of people’s relationships. If we did, we would not issue three-quarters of the marriage licenses we do.”

The lone opponent to speak in the chamber, Rubén Díaz Sr., a Democrat from the Bronx, invoked his own experiences as a minister to explain his vote, and rejected arguments from other senators that religion should not play a role in deciding who can legally marry in New York. “You should carry your Bible all the time,” Mr. Díaz said.

The bill’s defeat by a vote of 38 to 24 suggested that the speeches did little to influence the outcome. “People may say the debate sways them, but the truth of it is, it’s pretty much decided,” Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat who supported the bill, said before the proceedings began.

155 2009-12-04 Don Congdon, a literary agent who spotted the talent of Ray Bradbury early in both their careers and whose long list of celebrated authors also included William Styron, Jack Finney, Evan S. Connell, William L. Shirer and David Sedaris, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn Heights. He was 91.

The death was confirmed by his son, Michael.

Mr. Congdon, who started out as a messenger at a small New York agency, developed an enviable reputation as a skilled editor, tough negotiator and shrewd judge of talent. While still a young editor at Simon & Schuster, he tuned in to the early stories of Ray Bradbury, who became one of his first clients after he set up as a full-time literary agent in 1947.

In 1966 he caused a stir in the publishing world, and precipitated a celebrated lawsuit by Jacqueline Kennedy, when, after spirited bargaining, he sold Look magazine the serial rights to “The Death of a President,” William Manchester’s study of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, for more than $600,000.

The sum, staggering for the time, added to Mrs. Kennedy’s fears that the book would bring unwanted publicity to her family and delve too deeply into personal matters. She filed suit against Mr. Manchester, Look and Harper & Row, the book’s publisher, for breach of contract and sought an injunction to halt publication. After negotiating with Look and Harper & Row for changes in the magazine excerpts and the book, Mrs. Kennedy dropped her suit.

Donald Keith Congdon was born on Jan. 7, 1918, in Crawford, Pa. His father was a railroad worker and his mother ran the family’s boardinghouse, which the bank seized during the Depression.

With $8 in his pocket, Mr. Congdon moved to New York in 1935, when he was just out of high school, and found work with the Lurton Blassingame Literary Agency, where he delivered manuscripts to publishers in Midtown, picking up the rejects on return trips. By 1940 he was secretary to Mr. Blassingame, and had begun building his own list of authors.
156 2009-12-04 BERLIN — The top European court on Thursday overruled an attempt by German regulators to allow Deutsche Telekom, the former state-run phone monopoly, to ban competitors from having access to its new high-speed broadband network.

The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg sided with the European Commission, which had sued Germany over a 2006 national law that granted Deutsche Telekom a “holiday” from European Union regulations for its 3 billion euro ($4.5 billion) fiber optic network.

The commission, which had criticized the German regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, for endorsing the exemption, called the court’s decision an affirmation that regulatory “holidays” were illegal.

“This judgment is an important precedent for telecom regulation across Europe,” the commission said in a statement. “The judgment will help the European Commission and national regulatory authorities to promote, independently of political pressure, effective competition on the telecoms markets.”

Deutsche Telekom, which is 32 percent owned by the state, had pursued the exemption to compensate for its investment in building the network. By the end of 2008, the network reached 10.9 million households in Germany, and Deutsche Telekom used it to sell its own video programming package with voice and Internet service.
157 2009-12-04 Re “A Jew in England,” by Roger Cohen (column, The New York Times on the Web, Dec. 1):

Just as anti-Semitism existed in postwar England, as Mr. Cohen recounts, it was not quite absent in America at that time. In the late 1940s, my father-in-law, also named Cohen, was rejected from a prominent Midwestern university that set quotas on the number of Jews it accepted each year, only to be accepted during the next admission cycle after his family changed their last name to Corwin, a decidedly more Scots-Irish name.

His opportunity to do what he loved and did best, science, came about only because he seemed on his new application form originally to come from the Sceptred Isle rather than from a shtetl in Belarus.
158 2009-12-04 Gather all your young foodies this Saturday and head to Brooklyn Kitchen Labs for an 11 a.m. free screening of “What’s on Your Plate?” This documentary produced and directed by Catherine Gund takes on the well-trodden terrain of food politics, but this time from the point of view of two 11-year-olds. Over the course of a year, Sadie and Safiyah try to make sense of New York’s complicated food systems by visiting farmers, supermarkets, fast-food chains and school lunchrooms. The girls sift through enough layers of the sustainable movement to make Michael Pollan proud: tackling everything from the origin of the food they eat, how it’s cultivated and prepared, to the many miles it travels from its harvest to their plate to the tricky problem of what to do with leftovers. An organic breakfast beforehand is definitely in order.
159 2009-12-04 The blood clot that caused her stroke was on her brain stem, and luckily it dissipated, causing no lasting damage. But Ms. Gates did suffer dizziness, weakness and vision disturbances, and the episode worsened her depression. She cried every day in the hospital, and continued crying when she returned home.

And she did not have time to be sick, having just completed a course of training in home health care after 30 years of administrative work. She was laid off from an office job in March 2008, and employment, which she secures through a temp agency, has been only part time since.

This is where she gets really mad.

“I have a two-page résumé with all the jobs I’ve had, and all the skills I have, and I can’t get anything,” she said. “If I lose my home, I have no idea where I’m going to go. Probably a motel, or a shelter, where I’ll have to sleep with one eye open.”

Her two-bedroom apartment in Franklin Plaza in East Harlem was passed down to her when her mother died in 1991. She has lived there since she was 3, and still sleeps in her childhood bedroom. She pays $803 a month, and without steady work she has fallen behind for a second time this year and faces eviction.

She still gets unemployment benefits, because she works only part-time. She used to get $226 a week, but now gets $25 extra, for reasons she does not understand. “I guess it’s out of the generosity of the state’s heart,” she said.

In April, Ms. Gates, who is single and has no children, owed $1,969 in maintenance and faced eviction for the first time. Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, two of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, paid her debt. But she fell behind again, and now owes $1,885. She faces an eviction proceeding in housing court on Dec. 21, and may ask the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies for further assistance.

Her part-time job as a home health care aide pays minimum wage and offers no health insurance. She was not approved for an emergency loan from the Human Resources Administration to help with the arrears in April because officials did not think she would be able to pay it back. Her application for Medicaid, which she submitted during her hospitalization, was approved after what she called an agonizing wait.

“I’ve never been in this situation before,” she said. “I’ve never not been able to pay.”

She cannot even afford a MetroCard, she said.

“If I break $200 a month,” in earnings, “I’m doing good. The only thing I can afford to do is go around the corner and come back.”
160 2009-12-04 The industry frightened Americans — and gave Republicans a shrill talking point — when it declared in October that proposed reform legislation would drive up costs for virtually everyone by as much as thousands of dollars a year. The nonpartisan persuasively contradicted that claim this week.

Undaunted, the industry issued a rebuttal report, claiming again that premiums would soar. We find this second industry report no more persuasive than the first.

In its long-awaited study, the C.B.O. estimates that most Americans would pay the same or less in premiums in 2016, after reforms have kicked in, than they would pay under current law. Those who work for large employers (more than 50 workers) would, on average, see their premiums hold steady or drop by up to 3 percent per person covered. Those who work for small employers would also not see much change — anywhere from a 1 percent increase to a 2 percent reduction.

The insurance industry and its Republican allies are eagerly trumpeting the C.B.O.’s finding that by 2016 the cost of insurance for 32 million people projected to buy individual policies (on new exchanges or directly from insurers) would be 10 percent to percent higher than the average premium for nongroup coverage under current law.

What critics fail to acknowledge is that some 14 million people who would be buying policies with their own money would be getting more for their higher premiums. The typical policy after reform would cover a substantially larger share of enrollees’ costs (with lower co-payments, deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses), and would offer a slightly wider range of benefits, than the typical policies currently sold to individuals.
161 2009-12-04 There will be no come-from-behind sprint into solvency for the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, which announced on Thursday that it was seeking bankruptcy protection.

The decision by the long-struggling gambling operation, which runs 66 horse-race betting establishments throughout the city, most recognizable by their green signs, provoked little surprise.

In September, Gov. David A. Paterson issued an executive order authorizing the corporation to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection as a way to regain financial footing. The state had taken over control of the corporation about a year earlier after the city threatened to shut it down because of mounting losses.

The filing will allow OTB to scale back and reorganize the operation, which is on pace to lose $40 million this year and run out of money by March, said Meyer Frucher, the new OTB chairman. The current debt of the corporation, which handles about $1 billion in wagers each year, is about $83 million, with much larger future liabilities.

The corporation is planning to close “a significant number” of its run-down parlors as it shifts emphasis to telephone and online betting operations, which have attracted younger and wealthier users, Mr. Frucher said. “We clearly want to move away from a straight brick-and-mortar model,” he said.

Leonard Allen, president of District Council 37 Local 2021, which represents most of the OTB employees in the city, said he expected about half of the 1,050 workers to be laid off. “It seems that it was the only option,” he said. “They’re running out of money.”
162 2009-12-04 West Bank settler leaders rejected a personal plea from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to respect a government-ordered construction freeze in their communities, vowing to keep confronting security forces sent to enforce the edict. Jewish settlers blocked inspectors from entering a settlement to search for unauthorized construction, the third straight day of such confrontations. There has been no violence, but authorities have made at least four arrests. Mr. Netanyahu summoned settler leaders to Tel Aviv in a bid to defuse the tensions. A leader of the settlers, Dani Dayan, called the meeting “difficult” and “emotionally charged.”
163 2009-12-04 Being a street scalper has never been harder in New York, despite a change in state law in 2007 that essentially legalized the resale of tickets for whatever price the market will bear. Many scalpers say the law has hurt street sales by enabling online agencies and Internet marketplaces like StubHub to flourish.

The law also prohibits the resale of tickets within 1,500 feet of a large venue, like Madison Square Garden. But that seldom deters the regulars at the Garden; on Tuesday evening, more than 20 young men, almost uniformly clad in black parkas, jeans and black knit caps, worked the sidewalks of Seventh Avenue, calling out “Knickstickets, Knickstickets.”

One, who declined to provide his name because he said he feared being arrested, positioned himself in the middle of the river of pedestrians streaming toward Pennsylvania Station like a bear fishing for salmon. Brazenly flouting the law against selling so close to the Garden, he fanned his wares out at eye level for all to see. Nary a sideways glance.

“Man, it’s hard to sell a Knicks ticket out here,” the scalper lamented.

Eventually, a French couple bought a pair for $90, after scrutinizing them for signs of authenticity for a full two minutes. “How much was the b.o. on those?” a friend of the scalper asked, referring to the box-office price.

“Fifty-six,” the scalper said, meaning the buyers had paid about 80 percent of face value. It was half an hour before the Knicks would tip off against the Phoenix Suns, and he would not sell another ticket for as much that night.

If not for European tourists, there would be hardly any buyers at all, the scalper said. In three hours on the sidewalk, he said he had sold 11 of his 20 tickets.

“If I make $10 a ticket, I’m happy,” he said. “A working man’s got to work hard to make $100.”

The poor starts for the Knicks and Nets have driven down the value of the tickets but have not erased all demand, according to executives of companies that operate online ticket-selling platforms. The number of tickets changing hands is rising, though the prices are falling, often well below face value, they said.

Donald J. Vaccaro, the chief executive of TicketNetwork in Vernon, Conn., which helps ticket brokers sell online, said his company had sold about 12,000 Knicks tickets this year, up from 9,000 last year, and about 2,000 Nets tickets, up from about 1,500.

“We’re still doing well,” Mr. Vaccaro said. “We’re just selling more tickets at less money.”

At StubHub’s storefront in Midtown, some brokers stop by in early evening to pick up tickets that went unsold online. Many of those wind up in the hands of scalpers, who act as sellers of last resort. But StubHub has no involvement in that trade, said Joe Piacenti, territory manager for StubHub in New York. “There is a disconnect as to what happens to the tickets once they leave here,” Mr. Piacenti said.

In contrast to the extraordinarily high asking prices that can be found on StubHub for tickets to hot concerts or World Series games, the market for Nets and Knicks tickets has nearly hit bottom. Mr. Piacenti pointed out that on Tuesday, seats for that night’s Knicks game were available for as little as $4.99, plus fees. Somebody was offering nine tickets to the Nets’ game against Golden State on Wednesday for $1 each, before fees.

Deals like that have left the white-haired scalper in the Izod Center lot lonely and dejected.

He said he was not surprised that he had no competitors. If he had not lost more than $200 at the racetrack in the afternoon, he would have been home and dry, he said.

Instead, he spent a rainy evening confronted by bargain-seekers of all ages and pedigrees.

A bearded young man in a suit and tie approached. The scalper said he would take $10 each.

“Would you do eight?” the man in the suit asked.

“Eight tickets?” the scalper responded, eyes widening beneath the bill of his baseball cap.

“No, eight dollars,” the customer said.

“Come on,” the scalper said firmly. “I’ll do $10.”

After the buyer left, the scalper shrugged. “This isn’t a business anymore, not with the product they have,” he said, nodding toward the arena, where more than 8,000 seats were unfilled.
164 2009-12-04 Chapman has a pulsating fastball that sets him apart from virtually every professional pitcher, but he was a modest 24-21 with a 3.72 earned run average in four seasons in Cuba. He had 379 strikeouts and 210 walks in 341 2/3 innings. Last season, he had a 4.03 E.R.A. in 118 1/3 innings.

The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, who have been aggressive in signing international pitchers, had their best chance to observe Chapman at the World Baseball Classic in March. Chapman was 0-1 with a 5.68 E.R.A. in two games. He struck out eight and walked four in six and a third innings against Japan and Australia.

The speculation about Chapman’s future contract has ranged from Daisuke Matsuzaka’s six-year, $52 million deal with Boston in 2006 to Jose Contreras’s four-year, $32 million deal with the Yankees in 2002 to Stephen Strasburg’s four-year, $15.1 million deal with the Washington Nationals. It would seem that Chapman, who will almost certainly start his career in the minor leagues, could come close to matching Strasburg’s contract.

Before the Yankees signed Orlando Hernandez (four-year, $6.6 million contract in 1998) and Contreras, they had scouted both multiple times and knew they were pursuing pitchers acknowledged as the best in Cuba. In the year before the Red Sox signed Matsuzaka, they watched each of his starts in Japan and knew he was the best pitcher in that country. No team has as detailed a dossier on Chapman, who was not yet the best pitcher in Cuba. “I find it very difficult to believe any team would offer Strasburg money, based on eight-month-old gun readings from the W.B.C.,” Kehoskie said. “Beyond that, Chapman was declared a free agent nine weeks ago. When was the last time a player was a free agent for nine weeks, generated little or no action, and then had teams suddenly making record-breaking offers?”

Perhaps Chapman dismissed Mejia, who had never represented a major leaguer, because he grew impatient with his situation. The Hendricks brothers, who have Andy Pettitte and Kendry Morales of Cuba as clients, have not announced if Chapman will work out for teams and did not respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages.

Robert Eenhoorn, a former Yankees infielder who is the general manager of the Netherlands national team, is the rare official who has seen Chapman pitch. Eenhoorn watched Chapman against South Korea in 2007 and said Chapman was impressive for that level of play.

“He has an exploding fastball, but was also wild with it,” Eenhoorn said. “He is, without a doubt, a great player. But, as everyone knows, velocity alone is not enough nowadays.”

Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman declined to discuss Chapman. Although Chapman is much different from Kei Igawa, the soft-tossing left-hander from Japan, it would be natural for Cashman to ponder what went awry with Igawa as he considers Chapman.

After the Red Sox outbid the Yankees for the rights to negotiate with Matsuzaka, the Yankees bid $26 million for Igawa’s rights, then signed him to a four-year, $20 million deal. Igawa had a 6.66 E.R.A. in 2007 and 2008 and was marooned in the minor leagues last season.

Speaking generally about the pursuit of international pitchers, Cashman said: “Everything influences you. On the failures, you assess where it failed and why. You look at the competition level and how it translates to pitching here.”

Since teams have limited information about Chapman, everything he does is dissected. That includes his jettisoning of Mejia. It is one of the unanswered questions about Chapman, a talented pitcher who is surrounded by unanswered questions.
165 2009-12-04 A New York appeals court ruled Thursday that the state could not use eminent domain on behalf of Columbia University to obtain parts of a 17-acre site in Upper Manhattan, setting back plans for a satellite campus at a time of discord over government power to acquire property.

In a 3-to-2 decision, a panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan annulled the state’s 2008 decision to take property for the expansion project, saying that its condemnation procedure was unconstitutional.

The majority opinion was scathing in its appraisal of how the “scheme was hatched,” using terms like “sophistry” and “idiocy” in describing how the state went about declaring the neighborhood blighted, the main prerequisite for eminent domain.

The $6.3 billion expansion plan is not dead; an appeal has been promised, and Columbia still controls most of the land. But at a time when the government’s use of eminent domain on behalf of private interests has become increasingly controversial, the ruling was a boon for opponents.

“I feel unbelievable,” said Nicholas Sprayregen, the owner of several self-storage warehouses in the Manhattanville expansion area and one of two property owners who have refused to sell to the university. “I was always cautiously optimistic. But I was aware we were going against 50 years of unfair cases against property owners.”

A spokesman for Columbia, David M. Stone, referred all questions to state officials.

Warner Johnston, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the agency that approved the use of eminent domain, called the decision “wrong and inconsistent with established law, as consistently articulated by the New York State Court of Appeals, most recently with respect to E.S.D.C.’s Atlantic Yards project.” He added, “E.S.D.C. intends to appeal this decision.”

The ruling comes less than two weeks after the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, ruled 6 to 1 that the state could exercise eminent domain in taking businesses, public property and private homes on behalf of a Brooklyn developer who planned a 22-acre residential development and a basketball arena.

Proponents of Columbia’s plan expressed optimism that Thursday’s decision would be overturned by the Court of Appeals. But Norman Siegel, a lawyer for the holdout owners, called the ruling a “major victory” in a state that has been deferential to its power to take private property.

“The decision sets forth a road map for how private property owners in New York and throughout America can fight back when government tries to seize your property in the name of eminent domain,” he said.

Columbia embarked in 2003 on its first major expansion in 75 years, saying it had outgrown its Morningside Heights campus. It planned to replace the low-scale industrial buildings north of 125th Street, in the Manhattanville area, with school buildings, laboratories, restaurants and tree-lined streets.

The court’s decision, if it is upheld, is not fatal to the plan. Columbia already owns or controls 61 of 67 buildings in the 17-acre project area. Presumably, it can build around the holdout owners, or come to agreement with them. But the state and the university have sought the entire site.

Mr. Sprayregen said he never opposed the plan. “The research and education they will perform are very beneficial,” he said. “The fact remains that even if they don’t get the last 5 percent, they can still go ahead and build their campus.”

Amrik Singh, who manages two gas stations involved in the case, said: “I want to thank God and the judges who gave us the decision. We were scared. We were all worried about our jobs.”

Mr. Sprayregen and the family that owns the stations challenged the process the state used in finding that the neighborhood was blighted.

Writing for the majority, Justice James M. Catterson said there was a conflict of interest when the state hired the same real estate consultant, AKRF, that Columbia had hired to make the determination of blight. “We questioned AKRF’s ability to provide ‘objective advice’ to the E.S.D.C., particularly with respect to its preparation of the blight study,” Justice Catterson wrote.

The blight designation, the court said, was “mere sophistry” about a neighborhood that was already undergoing a renaissance. The state’s development corporation committed to rezoning long before the study, “not for the goal of general economic development or to remediate an area that was blighted before Columbia acquired over 50 percent of the property, but rather solely for the expansion itself.”

“Even a cursory examination of the study reveals the idiocy of considering things like unpainted block walls or loose awning supports as evidence of a blighted neighborhood,” Justice Catterson wrote.

A spokesman for the firm said in response to the court’s ruling: “As a firm of planners and analysts, AKRF’s responsibility is the collection and assessment of data in an objective and thorough manner. Our analyses help inform a public decision-making process. They are not advocacy documents.”

The court’s opinion also drew a distinction between the circumstances in Manhattanville and New London, Conn., the subject of a United States Supreme Court decision in 2005. In that case, the court upheld the taking of land, in part, because the city had devised a wide-ranging downtown revitalization plan.

In New York, the Appellate Division said the state and city development agencies “were compelled to engineer a public purpose for a quintessentially private development: eradication of blight,” after “having committed to allow Columbia to annex Manhattanville.”

The court found no civic purpose to this use of eminent domain and criticized state officials for arbitrarily closing the administrative record from further comment by opponents and withholding relevant public documents from the property owners.

In the dissent, Justice Peter Tom wrote that the expansion of an educational institution qualified as a public purpose. He wrote that the property owners’ arguments over blight constituted merely a “difference of opinion” that requires the court to defer to the state’s decision to use eminent domain. Justice Tom wrote that the Court of Appeals had used similar reasoning in the Atlantic Yards case.

Despite the recent Atlantic Yards ruling, the decision Thursday gave hope to property owners battling the use of eminent domain in Brooklyn and Queens. “We feel like we just got thrown a lifeline,” said Matthew Brinckerhoff, a lawyer for the property owners at Atlantic Yards.

A year ago, the City Council authorized the use of eminent domain to take a 62-acre area of mostly salvage yards and auto repair shops known as Willets Point in Queens. “The tide may be turning on the use of eminent domain for private purposes,” said Jake Bono, a spokesman for Willets Point United, a group of property owners opposed to condemnation.
166 2009-12-04 The best news for Nadal is that, after getting hammered on an indoor hardcourt last week, he is back on clay, where he is on the short list of all-time greats. He has lost only one best-of-five set match on clay in his career.

That defeat came at the French Open this year against Robin Soderling, who went on to reach the final and is now in the top 10. The tactics that the huge-hitting Soderling employed to create his upset in Paris — playing with deep aggression from the backcourt to rob Nadal of time — will certainly be part of the Czechs’ playbook in singles on Friday and Sunday against Nadal.

The Czechs have been essentially a two-man team all season, with Radek Stepanek and Tomas Berdych doing nearly all the heavy lifting. Although the Spaniards are clearly favorites to win this final (they have won 17 consecutive ties at home), they are no longer overwhelming favorites with Nadal hardly in rare form and Verdasco being replaced in Friday’s singles lineup by David Ferrer, who is no slouch on clay.

“One thing is for sure, we must not enter this final thinking the job is already done,” Verdasco said. “In that case, we might end up like Argentina in last year’s final against us in Mar del Plata. We are favorites, but it doesn’t mean that we are already champions.”

Both Stepanek and Berdych are capable of stealing time from Nadal, even on indoor clay. The erratic, 20th- ranked Berdych is — along with Soderling and Juan Martín Del Potro — one of the game’s most intimidating ball strikers, able to generate huge power with little apparent effort.

The 12th-ranked Stepanek possesses terrific approach shots and volleys and a hyperactive, demonstrative on-court demeanor. Although serve-and-volley rarely pays on clay anymore, Stepanek has had good results there, reaching the semifinals in Rome and the fourth round at the French Open last year and the quarterfinals of Barcelona this year.

In doubles, Stepanek and Berdych have never lost together in Davis Cup and are 3-0 this season, which explains why Lukas Dlouhy, who has won two Grand Slam titles in doubles this year with his Indian partner, Leander Paes, has been unable to crack the Czech lineup.

He at least has been nominated this time for Saturday’s doubles, but the Czech captain, Jaroslav Navratil, is likely to revert to Stepanek and Berdych unless they give the Czechs a 2-0 lead on Friday.

Above all, the 31-year-old Stepanek and the 24-year-old Berdych seem invested with the sort of missionary spirit that Davis Cup seems to generate: inspiring players who will probably never win a major individual title to lift their games in the interest of the collective. It was not always thus for the Czechs. Because of conflicts with Czech tennis authorities, Stepanek refused to play for nearly three years before returning in 2007 to help the team beat Roger Federer and Switzerland and qualify for the 16-team World Group.

This year, Stepanek has been the pivotal figure. He won decisive fifth matches against France and Argentina and survived a statistical marvel of an opening match with the Croatian giant Ivo Karlovic in the semifinals, in which Karlovic served a record 78 aces and still lost in the fifth set, 16-14, after 5 hours 59 minutes.

This is the Czechs’ first final in 29 years. Their only Davis Cup victory came in 1980 when the country was still Czechoslovakia and its star player, Ivan Lendl, had not yet left communism behind to become a United States citizen.

Lendl has connections with this team and met with Stepanek when he was training in Florida this year. Lendl may even make it to Barcelona, along with 1,500 traveling Czech fans who should be a vocal minority in the 16,500-seat Palau Sant Jordi.

The Spanish won here in 2000 when Costa was on the squad instead of running it and Nadal carried the flag for the team as a promising 14- year-old junior but was not leading it. The main man that year was Juan Carlos Ferrero, who won the decisive point. Ferrero, who won matches for Spain on the way to this final, was not selected this time, but he has been in Barcelona as a practice partner. “This place brings back such good memories,” he said.

Calls for a format change continue, and there are some daring proposals being floated — if only floated — in the tennis community, including a possible combined men’s and women’s Davis Cup. But the International Tennis Federation, which operates the competition and depends on it for revenue, has remained committed to the World Group format and resistant to a World Cup style approach at a predetermined final site.

The I.T.F. recently commissioned a London consulting firm to study the economic impact of the Davis Cup, and the firm determined that the competition, across all its divisions, generates $184 million of impact annually and will generate $37 million for Barcelona.

The other bottom line, however, is that no final in recent years has generated global interest of the sort that Grand Slam finals do. Federer, the game’s biggest star, has not played in a nonrelegation match since 2004. But at least the Cup and the Spaniards have Nadal.

Now let’s see how empty his batteries truly are.
167 2009-12-04 And banks were supposed to refuse modifications if they could do better by foreclosing, whatever the effect on the borrower.

Nearly two months ago, I spent a day at a JPMorgan Chase call center in Jacksonville, Fla., where employees had once worked the phones trying to persuade people to take out mortgages. Now the hundreds of desks were filled by people trying to arrange modifications of loans made by Chase or Washington Mutual, whose assets JPMorgan Chase acquired after that bank was closed by the government.

One of the most frustrated Chase employees I met was Domonique Perez, whose job was to round up the documents from borrowers who had been granted temporary modifications.

It was, she said, not going well.

She told of one man who had filed almost all the necessary documents — the permission slip for Chase to look at old tax returns, the pay stubs for current income — but not the affidavit of financial hardship. She had called and called, she said, and sent letters by regular mail and by FedEx, but the man was not getting back to her.

When I called Ms. Perez again this week, she did not recall what had happened in that case. But over all, she said, “it’s getting a little better. I’m getting a lot more files that do have all the documents.”

It will need to get a lot better. Chase disclosed in November that nearly a quarter of trial modifications had failed because the borrower did not make even a single payment, and that nearly half had failed to make all three payments required before the modification could become permanent.

Of those who had made all three payments, only about a quarter had submitted all the required documents.

Updated numbers will be released next week. “It is getting better,” David Lowman, the chief executive of Chase’s mortgage business, told me this week. But the gains are in contrast to a very low level of compliance.

In Washington, there are suspicions that banks simply are not trying, that they do not really want to make modifications. There is talk of shaming them into action. Tempers may run hot when bankers meet with Treasury officials on Monday and then testify before a Congressional committee on Tuesday.

Listening in on calls to the Jacksonville center gave me a perspective on what was going on.

The Chase representatives appeared eager to approve modifications, and were prepared to believe anything people said about their income. Modifications went to those who came up with the right income number, neither too high to qualify nor too low to be likely to meet the modified payments.

I listened to one call from a woman who sounded as if her world were collapsing. She and her husband operated a business, which seemed to be teetering near collapse, and its finances were intertwined with theirs. They were behind in payments on their mortgage.

Under the administration’s mortgage modification program, the new payment, including escrow payments for taxes and insurance, is to be 31 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income. The woman first said their income was $6,000 a month, the amount they had taken out of the business when times were good.

That number, it turned out, was too high to qualify for a modification. When told that, the woman said she thought that for at least the next couple of months, they might be able to take only $2,000. That number was too low. She got no modification that day. Had she come up with a number somewhere in between, she might have qualified.

The arithmetic of “Obama mods,” as some call them, is laid out by the government. The 31 percent number is fixed in stone, which provides some simplicity but also can be arbitrary. A family with a lot of other obligations might not be able to afford 31 percent, while one with few other debts could afford much more.

To get the payment down to the 31 percent figure, the bank first cuts the interest rate, to as low as 2 percent, while leaving the other terms of the mortgage unchanged. For the vast majority of mortgages being modified, that is enough. If not, the term of the mortgage is stretched out to as long as 40 years.

Finally, if that is not enough, part of the principal can be deferred. That deferred amount is still owed, but no interest accrues and the lump sum is due at the end of the 40 years, or when the house is sold.

Calculating those numbers is only the first step. After determining the present value of that projected series of payments, the bank then compares it with what it could get by foreclosing. If the bank would be better off by foreclosing, then there is no modification.

One thing working in borrowers’ favor is that foreclosure values are heavily discounted to take into account the delays involved in the process, the costs of maintaining a home until it can be sold and the possibility that property values will continue to fall.

In one case I saw, the house was estimated to be worth $227,100, far less than was owed. The present value of the payments to be made under the modified loan was $159,611. modification was nonetheless approved, and the monthly payment fell to $1,004 from $1,877.

What made the difference was the bank’s conclusion that it would get a present value of just $139,568 from a foreclosure, nearly 40 percent less than the estimated value: the low payments were worth more than the alternative.

All these numbers are based on a lot of assumptions — assumptions that few borrowers will be in a position to know, let alone challenge. And they have the perverse effect that modifications will be harder to get if property values improve, or even if they simply stabilize and seem likely to fall no further. That would make the foreclosure value appear higher to the banks.

It is far from clear that some modifications being granted are really in the borrowers’ interests. Some will be able to stay in homes when they could rent a comparable house for less, and will be so far underwater that they are unlikely to be able to sell the house for years without defaulting on the new terms. It is conceivable that this process is doing more to drag out the foreclosure crisis than to alleviate it.

But perhaps we should not be too critical of anybody involved in the modification effort, either the administration or those trying to arrange modifications. The mess was made years ago, when bad loans were made and the ready availability of credit was driving house values to unsustainable levels. Cleaning it up is not going to be a pleasant experience for anyone.
168 2009-12-04 Men and women desperate for communion, all but aflame with a need for understanding, wander the streets of a Southern town in “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” Carson McCullers ’s first novel, published in 1940 when she was just 23. In prose both limpid and tense with feeling she charted the roiling interior lives of an alcoholic choking on social injustice, a black doctor whose high moral vision has alienated his family, an adolescent tomboy with a passion for Mozart, and the mute to whom each turns for companionship.

Sadly, little of the furious feeling that consumes McCullers’s characters has made its way into the respectful but lifeless stage version that opened on Thursday night at New York Theater Workshop, a co-production with the Acting Company. The playwright Rebecca Gilman (“Spinning Into Butter”) has written a workmanlike adaptation that draws directly on the novel’s dialogue and moves through most of its major incidents clearly enough. The director, Doug Hughes, provides a tasteful frame (the weathered wooden set by Neil Patel is gorgeous), and the cast is solid. But what’s onstage is a surface sketch of the book, one that fails to communicate any of its emotional substance. It’s a mere blueprint of a cathedral, not the majestic building itself.

The cause was probably half lost to begin with. Theatrical adaptations of novels are always tricky, but the show’s creators might have been encouraged by the success of McCullers’s own stage version of “The Member of the Wedding,” which starred two greats, Julie Harris and Ethel Waters, and was later turned into a deeply affecting film. That novel is far more concentrated, however, and its central character is a youngster whose loneliness is continually expressed in anxious talk.

The isolated characters in “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter” cannot or will not express the yearnings boiling inside them. When they do, their passions overcome them, and the results are embarrassment and further alienation. In desperation, each turns to John Singer (Henry Stram), a gentle-eyed mute, taking his passive friendliness for profound understanding. For each he becomes the sympathetic companion without whom life would be too cruel to bear.

Singer, in turn, lives only for the friend whose company he loses in this version’s rather abrupt first scene. Antonapoulos (I. N. Sierros), a lumbering Greek and a fellow mute given to dangerous outbursts, is carted off to the asylum, leaving Singer adrift and bereft. Taking his dinners at the local cafe, Singer is accosted by Jake (Andrew Weems), a deeply alienated socialist who tamps down his rage at the meekness of his fellow men in the face of economic injustice by drinking himself into oblivion.

At the boarding house where he lives, Singer becomes an object of fascination for Mick Kelly (Cristin Milioti), the dreamy tomboy whose soul feasts on the beauty of the classical music she hears on the radio when she wanders into the better parts of town. Singer also begins receiving visits from Dr. Copeland (James McDaniel), whom he meets after offering him a light in the street one night. The doctor’s righteous belief in the dignity of his race is continually being disappointed, and his anger at social oppression eats away at him as disease plagues his lungs.

The actors all embody these characters with commitment and grace. Mr. Weems’s Jake is fiery-eyed and harsh, Mr. McDaniel’s doctor rigid and dignified. Ms. Milioti bears a resemblance to McCullers, and her brown bangs have been cropped short to accentuate it. (In the novel the character is “towheaded.”) She’s reasonably convincing as an awkward teenager.

Roslyn Ruff, playing the doctor’s daughter and the housekeeper in the Kelly household, brings a subdued warmth to her role. As the repository of various characters’ urgent confidences, Mr. Stram is aptly sweet and blank.

But without the access the novel grants us to the feelings simmering under the awkward surfaces of these misfits, it is hard to work up any great sympathy for them. Ms. Gilman occasionally transfers some of the narrated text into dialogue, as when Mick speaks of the “inside room” in which her secret feelings reside.

For the most part, however, the characters remain thin, two-dimensional presences; the poetry inside them is left unarticulated. Instead of finding our own hearts inflamed by these lonely souls’ angers and passions and pain, we remain polite, unmoved observers.

169 2009-12-04 At the draw for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the television network Sky Italia thought it saw duplicity in the way the former German soccer star Lothar Matthäus selected Italy’s group. The station claimed that the balls had been heated and cooled so that Matthäus knew which teams he was selecting as he placed Italy in a daunting group with the United States, the Czech Republic and Ghana.

“The Italians are mad if they think that,” Matthäus said at the time. “That is utter nonsense.”

Considering that Italy won the World Cup that year, Matthäus had a point.

Of course, soccer’s world governing body, known by its acronym FIFA, steadfastly denies that high jinks are involved. Outside experts say there is no proof that the process is illusory.

“We are not David Copperfield, and Siegfried and Roy,” Guido Tognoni, a former spokesman for FIFA, said in Las Vegas at the draw for the 1994 World Cup.

Yet conspiracy theories abound. In 2005, the issue was part of a final exam in a cryptology course at the University of Virginia.

Part of the suspicion comes because soccer is a global sport that evokes national passions, said Mike Woitalla, the executive editor of Soccer America magazine.

Americans do not usually root as a nation in a sporting sense, cheering instead for our alma maters and local professional sports teams. The Olympics are an exception, and the Super Bowl draws more interest in the commercials than the game. But much of the rest of the world reaches a fever pitch over soccer.

“In America, you might have fans from Boston thinking they were robbed by a bad call, but in soccer it’s an entire country feeling that somebody treated them unfairly,” Woitalla said. “It’s a fan’s feelings multiplied by millions.”

Conspiracy theories regarding soccer are likely to flourish readily in countries where authorities and elites have often failed the public, said Andrei Markovits, a professor of politics and German studies at the University of Michigan.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see a much greater notion of conspiracy in countries like Argentina, Italy and Greece and much less in places like Sweden, Norway, Britain and Germany,” said Markovits, author of the forthcoming book, “Gaming the World: How Sports are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture.”

FIFA also has opened itself to charges of deception by arbitrarily changing the rules of the draw from one World Cup to the next. One time, performances in the two most recent World Cups are given priority in seeding teams. Another time, it is the three most recent World Cups that count. International rankings wax and wane in importance. Next time, who knows, the standard might be appearances on “Dancing with the Stars.”

And it does not help matters that Friday’s draw comes amid a sprawling match-fixing scandal involving club teams in Europe and soccer officials.

“I hate conspiracy theories,” Markovits said. “They’re an easy way out for people seeking explanations for complex things. That said, I don’t think the draw is rigged, but I’m less likely to completely dismiss it as a crackpot simplification than I would have been three weeks ago.”

In truth, the World Cup draw is not as entirely random as the weekly Powerball lottery. FIFA seeks geographic diversity in each of the eight four-team groups. And it gives the host nation a top seed, believing that local interest is boosted if the host team stays alive. No home team has failed to advance beyond the first round.

For the 2010 World Cup, the host, South Africa, will have a top seed even though it is ranked 86th in the world. Thus it will avoid such powers as Brazil, Germany and Argentina in group play.

“I never thought any of the draws were rigged,” said Bruce Arena, who coached the United States in the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. “The only thing that seems odd to me is how the host country gets decent draws. They never end up in the Group of Death.”

Well, almost never. Arena also coached the United States at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Upon realizing that the opening match was against Argentina, he lamented about American naïveté, saying, “We’re too stupid to fix a draw.”
170 2009-12-04 Under the plan, India would slow the growth of emissions by reducing its levels of so-called carbon intensity — roughly the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output — by 20 to 25 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. In the past, India has resisted setting such targets as a potential constraint on growth. Yet even with the target, total emissions would continue to rise, though the rate of growth would slow.

“We are prepared to do even more,” Mr. Ramesh said, if a fair deal can be reached in Copenhagen. “This is our baseline. We will do this on our own.”

Last week, President Obama announced that the United States, the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China, would set a provisional target to cut its total greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050. The next day, the Chinese government announced a target to slow emissions by reducing carbon intensity levels by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels.

Neither the Chinese nor the American plan satisfied many critics, who want both countries to commit to far bolder steps. Navroz K. Dubash, a climate change specialist in New Delhi, said the American pledge was actually a lesser commitment than it would have been obligated to meet under the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States refused to ratify. Mr. Dubash said that India had become a more constructive participant in climate change negotiations, but that the flurry of pre-Copenhagen announcements did not represent a breakthrough response to the crisis.

“The game seems to be that all countries pick a politically safe number,” said Mr. Dubash, an analyst with the Center for Policy Research. “India is now joining that game. And the game started with the United States.”

As yet, it is unclear how to assess the significance of the Indian target. Mr. Ramesh told Parliament that the country’s carbon intensity level had already dropped by 17.6 percent from 1990 to 2005 — even as total emissions rose rapidly.

Michael A. Levi, an energy and environment expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, questioned the value of developing countries’ using carbon intensity targets as a measurement for slowing emissions growth.

In India’s case, Mr. Levi said, the target announced Thursday was less ambitious than policies the country had previously announced. Last summer, India announced that it would introduce domestic legislation to institute fuel efficiency standards, rapidly expand the use of solar power and so-called clean coal technology, introduce green building codes and expand forest cover.

“The offer is actually much smaller than almost every projection of what their current policies will accomplish, whether by Western or Indian economists,” Mr. Levi said by e-mail.

Politically, the climate change negotiations are a touchy subject in India. Many conservatives and leftists continue to argue that India should not be obligated to take any action, because developed countries are responsible for the bulk of the emissions currently in the atmosphere. Mr. Ramesh has come under harsh criticism for saying that India would be willing to show flexibility in negotiations. Some critics accused him of selling out Indian interests to the United States.

But in his speech, Mr. Ramesh reiterated what he described as India’s nonnegotiable positions: It would not agree to any legally binding emissions reductions and would not sign any agreement that stipulated a peak year for Indian emissions.

India is seeking financial and technical assistance from the West. If such assistance is forthcoming, he said, India could be willing to submit to international oversight on any emissions mitigation financed by that aid.
171 2009-12-04 Worker productivity in the United States was less robust than previously thought in the third quarter as workers earned more money and output rose at a slower pace, the government reported on Thursday.

The Labor Department said that nonfarm productivity rose at an annual rate of 8.1 percent, still the quickest rate since the third quarter of 2003, rather than the 9.5 percent rate reported last month.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast that growth in third-quarter productivity would be revised down to 8.5 percent. Productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, grew at a 6.9 percent rate in the second quarter.

The nation’s services sector, meanwhile, unexpectedly contracted in November, with an index measuring activity falling to its lowest reading since July, according to an industry report released on Thursday.

The Institute for Supply Management said its services index shrank to 48.7 in November from 50.6 in October. That was slightly below the 51.5 median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Reuters.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

In the productivity report, total nonfarm output in the third quarter grew at a 2.9 percent rate, rather than the 4 percent previously estimated, the department said. Output dropped at a 1.1 percent rate in the previous period. Aggressive cost-cutting has pushed productivity sharply higher.

177 2009-12-05 Still, the similarities in the surges are striking. The absolute number of additional troops is roughly the same: 30,000. The Iraq figure, 28,500 troops, was 7,000 more than Mr. Bush first announced; Mr. Obama’s team says that will not happen in this case.

The deployment time in the case of Iraq was six months; when the Pentagon first came to President Obama two months ago with a plan that stretched over 18 months, he offered up some withering questions. He turned to Gen. David H. Petraeus, now the head of Central Command and the commander in Iraq during the Bush surge, and asked: “What takes so long? What’s so hard about this?”

White House officials say it was Mr. Obama himself who pressed the idea of a surge of his own, openly acknowledging in a meeting that he had criticized it harshly during the campaign.

Both surges aimed to knock back an insurgency that had gained territory and caused high casualties, and to buy time and space to train local forces for combat. “Neither one of these surges,” said one officer involved in both decisions, “was born to exploit success. They were designed to reverse momentum.”

No one in the Obama White House voices much admiration for the inheritance left by Mr. Bush, so it was probably unintentional that when the Afghanistan strategy was announced on Tuesday, the rollout had echoes of the earlier one. Mr. Bush’s fact sheet on the surge carried the headline “The New Way Forward in Iraq.” Mr. Obama’s speech carried the title “The Way Forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan.”

But the commonalities end there. The Iraq surge worked in large part because there was powerful support in Anbar Province from the so-called Awakening, the movement by local Sunni tribes who rose up against extremists who were killing people, forcibly marrying local women and cutting off the hands of men who smoked in public. In Iraq, American officials believed that most leaders of a vigorous opposition, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, were foreigners.

The United States remains hopeful that it can capitalize on Afghan militias that have taken up arms against the Taliban in local areas, but a series of intelligence reports supplied to Mr. Obama since September found no evidence in Afghanistan of anything on the scale of the Iraqi Awakening movement. What’s more, in Afghanistan the extremists, the Taliban, are natives.

“They are part of the furniture in Afghanistan; they have always been there,” one of Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism experts said, explaining why Mr. Obama’s goal is simply to degrade the Taliban’s power, not to defeat the group. In Iraq, the aim was to defeat the insurgents, a goal that has been largely achieved.

Then there is the question of whether Afghanistan’s military is trainable. Iraq’s forces were in a shambles, but the country had a tradition of military order. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reminded senators this week that in Iraq it took several years to get traction, and that in Afghanistan it could take longer.

“It was really late ’07 before the police in Iraq really started to step out,” he said, adding later, “we have to be careful with comparisons.”

Perhaps the biggest difference between the two surges is this: Mr. Bush never said how long his would last, and Mr. Obama went out of his way to declare that starting in July 2011, the tide would begin to flow out. The administration — mostly Mr. Gates — spent much of the week explaining the twin logic of going in strong and then signaling the beginning of a departure, emphasizing many times that if conditions were poor, the reduction in American forces would be slow.

The theory of the deadline was that it was the only way to show President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan that American patience was limited and that its commitment was not open-ended.

Mr. Gates again drew analogies to Iraq, saying, “I think, as we turn over more districts and more provinces to Afghan security control, much as we did with the provincial Iraqi control, that there will be a thinning of our forces and a gradual drawdown.”

But to Republican critics of that approach — and some architects of the Iraq surge — the announcement sows the seeds of failure before the process begins. “The question is: Is it fatal to the overall strategy?” asked Meghan O’Sullivan, the deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan in the Bush administration, and now a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School. “I think it may be.”

Her argument is that many in Afghanistan, and the leadership in Pakistan, will decide that the date is a slow-motion repeat of 1989, when the United States began to pull back from Afghanistan after the Soviets left in defeat. In the next few weeks, members of the Obama war cabinet are expected to show up in Islamabad and Kabul with one message: We’re not leaving. Really.
178 2009-12-05 The S.E.C. in particular has taken fire from critics recently for missing clues about continuing criminal frauds — most notably the $64 billion Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff for decades.

“I am concerned about all cases of securities fraud, just as I am alarmed about failures to detect them,” said Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who has introduced legislation that would revamp the S.E.C.’s fraud-detection policies.

The S.E.C. has sought to bolster its antifraud staff and has pointed to the recent charges against Mr. Rajaratnam as evidence it is cracking down on white-collar crime.

The details about the earlier case against Ms. Khan, in which she was convicted of wire fraud in 2001, came from court documents unsealed late Wednesday by a federal judge in San Jose, Calif., at the request of The New York Times and other news organizations.

Executives at Intel had developed suspicions about Mr. Rajaratnam in his pre-Galleon days at the investment bank Needham & Company because of his eerily accurate quarterly sales predictions, the documents said. The company conducted an internal investigation — which included the use of hidden video cameras — and discovered that Ms. Khan had sent faxes and notes to Mr. Rajaratnam with detailed sales data.

Ms. Khan later admitted to sending the data and pleaded guilty to wire fraud.

As part of the case, “she submitted to several debriefings, described her activities and those of other individuals involved in Rajaratnam’s efforts to obtain material, nonpublic information at several publicly traded companies,” prosecutors said in the documents.

But the prosecutors also said that despite her help, they were unable to prove that Mr. Rajaratnam had traded on the Intel information.

Exactly what happened next is a mystery. The case made its way from California to New York, according to the documents.

Lawyers for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York were brought in because of a separate investigation into Mr. Rajaratnam’s purported ties to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri Lankan terrorist group commonly known as the Tamil Tigers, according to a person briefed on the matter.

A spokesman for the Eastern District declined to comment.

The case may have fallen through the cracks between regional government offices. Even though they had some evidence that inside information was being passed to Mr. Rajaratnam, investigators may also have held off filing charges because they didn’t believe they had enough for a conviction or because they were investigating other individuals, said Joseph DiBenedetto, a criminal defense lawyer who is not involved in the Galleon case.

“It sure seems like something should have been done much earlier in this case, though,” Mr. DiBenedetto said.

Legal experts also questioned why the S.E.C. did not file civil charges against Ms. Khan, especially after she pleaded guilty. The S.E.C., which is responsible for overseeing public companies, typically files civil charges in conjunction with a criminal complaint.

In a statement Friday, an S.E.C. spokesman, John Nestor, said, “Prior decisions on how to proceed were made in consultation with our law enforcement partners."
179 2009-12-05 Carlo Janka of Switzerland won the event with a combined time of 2 minutes 32.26 seconds with his teammate Didier Defago second, 0.43 behind, and Natko Zrncic-Dim of Croatia third.

The American men’s team had another uneven performance in super-combined, in which the winner is the racer with the fastest combined time after one morning downhill run and one afternoon slalom run. But the race also offered a glimpse to the team’s potential.

In the downhill portion, Andrew Weibrecht produced another dramatic, scorching run, posting the fifth-best downhill time in the field. Miller was seventh.

Ted Ligety was 24th after the downhill and in contention in the slalom portion before he caught a ski tip in the race’s final stage and straddled a gate. Like Miller, he did not finish the slalom. Weibrecht, who has very little World Cup experience as a slalom skier, completed his slalom run, but fell to 19th in 2:35.32.

Miller, who rarely speaks to members of the news media any longer, spoke with reporters after his downhill run Friday.

“I switched to some skis I hadn’t used in three years because they suited the conditions and they were fast, but I couldn’t seem to get in the right position on them all of the time,” Miller said. “If I were in better shape, I could have made more of that run.”

The Beaver Creek Birds of Prey downhill, one of the most respected downhills on the World Cup tour, is Saturday. It is another race that has been good to Miller and Americans ski racers.

SWISS SURGE CONTINUES Friday’s results continued an early trend in this year’s men’s World Cup season, and it featured a surging, successful Swiss ski team. The super-combined winner, Carlo Janka, took over the overall points lead, 21 ahead of his teammate Didier Cuche.

In five races this season, the Swiss have three victories, a second place and two third-place finishes. The usually dominant Austrians have one victory, one second and one third in the same period.

“The spirit of our team right now is terrific,” Janka said Friday. “We have been helping each other and riding a wave.”

“We have a nice mix,” he said. “We have Cuche, who is very experienced. I have some experience. And then we have the young guy.”

Cuche is 35 years old, Defago is 32 and Janka is 23.
180 2009-12-05 Take the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which for many Americans was the most catastrophic event in their lifetimes. After the attacks, pundits predicted everything from a fundamental change in the national sense of humor to an American religious reawakening.

Uh, no. Although political jokes by late-night comics dropped by 54 percent in the month after the attacks, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, by the following February they were up 38 percent from their pre-Sept. 11 averages.

And despite an immediate surge of people going to church, attendance was back to the pre-attack levels by January 2002, according to the Barna Group, which researches religious trends. And in the years after the attacks, Americans were no more likely to say their religious faith was very important or to describe themselves as “deeply spiritual.”

A national catastrophe may have a short-term effect on religious fervor, but “what seems to have a more deep and lasting effect is a major life event — the loss of a loved one, a serious illness or loss of a job or the birth of a child,” said David Kinnaman, president of Barna.

Maybe one calamity, no matter how frightening, is unlikely to fundamentally transform most people. But what about a continuing event — a deep recession, say, like the one we have now? Will it change our behavior in any long-term way?

It might. Using data gathered by the National Opinion Research Center’s General Social Survey from 1972 to 2006, Paola Giuliano, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Antonio Spilimbergo of the International Monetary Fund looked at how serious recessions in different parts of the United States affected the people who lived there.

Examining information from 50,000 individuals, Professor Giuliano found that those who were 18 to 25 years old when the recession occurred — no matter what part of the country they lived in — were more likely to believe certain tenets than those who didn’t live through a severe recession, or those younger or older. They are more likely to believe that luck, as opposed to hard work, is the key to individual success, and that more government intervention is necessary to provide safety nets, even if that means higher taxes. Yet they also have less confidence in government.

Although the last two may seem contradictory, Professor Giuliano said that people might attribute their economic troubles to the government, but also want and need assistance from government.

Those years from 18 to 25 are “called the impressionable years — it’s the most important time for developing political and economic views,” she said. It is also when most people are entering the work force.

It’s difficult to predict what this portends for the future. In fact, it’s even hard to foresee if more immediate, concrete behavior changes — like stricter budgeting and more savings — will last past the current recession. If history is any example, it won’t.

“During the postwar years, what you see in a recession are blips,” Professor Reinhart said. “You get an increase in savings or a decline in debt for one or two years, and then it reverts back.”

Rationing, shortages and patriotism during the war years meant people saved a lot of money. But once the war was over, the floodgates opened. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage of personal savings as part of disposable personal income in 1945 was 20.4 percent; in 1946 — the year after the war ended — it dropped to 9.6 percent. It generally ranged from 7 to 10 percent for the next several decades and reached almost 11 percent in 1982.

Since then, primarily because of the introduction of easy credit, we’ve become a nation of spenders, with savings hovering around 2 percent or even less, until trouble hit in 2008. We reached a 5.4 percent savings rate in the second quarter of 2009 — but dropped down to 4.5 percent in the third quarter.

“Since the war, we haven’t strung together a period of time when the household savings rate really went up,” Professor Reinhart said. And while many who went through the Depression and the war did absorb a mentality of saving, she pointed out that it was ingrained “not over a year or two but over a 15-year period.”

We may see modifications in people’s spending and debt habits over the next few years, she said, but it is more likely to be a result of changes in the availability of credit, not a sudden national conversion to thrift.

“We might not see changes in people’s willingness to borrow, but in their ability to borrow,” she said.

This is not to say that we can never change, or that we can’t alter the culture of our society. It just takes a lot of work and time. Look at smoking, for example. The surgeon general first proclaimed unequivocally that smoking was bad for your health in 1964, when about 42 percent of American adults smoked. But people didn’t stub out their cigarettes on the spot. The rate gradually declined as the government and anti-tobacco forces attacked smoking on a number of fronts — banning cigarette commercials on television, placing warnings on cigarette packets, imposing high taxes on cigarettes and prohibiting smoking in restaurants and public spaces.

Now, about 20 percent of adults smoke; the figure hovers around 16 percent in areas like New York City where stiff taxes mean a pack of cigarettes can cost $8 and smokers must navigate strict antismoking laws.

“What works is a comprehensive approach,” said Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’ve changed from a society where people asked if you’d like a cigarette to one where people sheepishly ask, ‘Do you mind if I smoke?’ ”

So will our family maintain its budget-conscious ways over the long term? I’ll say yes, as long as we are forced to cope with the current financial situation. But if we win the lottery, all bets are off.
181 2009-12-05 As usual, the Art Kabinetts, organized mini-exhibits within selected booths, are excellent. They range from a reprise of the Francis M. Naumann gallery’s recent show “Marcel Duchamp: the Art of Chess” to diagram doodles and zines by the painter Amy Sillman at Sikkema Jenkins.

Bright spots in Art Nova, the fair’s section for young galleries showing new art, include Lorraine O’Grady’s photographs at Alexander Gray and new paintings by Dana Schutz at Zach Feuer. Ms. Schutz’s paintings, each titled with three verbs, imply frantic activity. (By late afternoon of the day of the V.I.P. preview, the large ones had already sold, though smaller works were still available.)

Also in the Art Nova section, at Reena Spaulings, are Merlin Carpenter’s paintings of reviews from The New York Times. (We get it: critics are part of the market, whether we like it or not.) Other dealers who specialize in attitude and art fair shenanigans are noticeably absent — Gavin Brown, to name the most obvious one. Turnover was heavy. About 60 of last year’s exhibitors did not return, although others quickly replaced them; the fair added five galleries over all.

A different, less abrasive sort of institutional critique is emerging. Big-name artists take a gentle ribbing, exemplified by Jonathan Monk’s flaccid version of a Jeff Koons balloon bunny at Lisson. And a new category — self-loathing neon art — has been born. At Peres Projects, a neon drawing with text by Dan Attoe says, “We’re all here because we were too afraid to deal with problems in our real lives.” And at Ingleby, a neon wall text by Peter Liversidge reads, “Miami Beach is where neon goes to die.”

A smattering of dealers have rejected the moody and cerebral. James Fuentes has a riotous installation of sculptures by Agathe Snow: bulbous figures with likenesses of Homer Simpson and President Obama against a graffiti-scrawled background. El Anatsui’s shimmering red-and-gold wall hangings that resemble crumpled textiles enliven Jack Shainman’s booth. And Salon 94’s showstopping installation by Marilyn Minter and Wangechi Mutu has larger-than-life photographs of a gold-dipped tongue (Ms. Mutu’s).

The Swiss gallery Gmurzynska has generated nonstop gossip and entertainment: first with its display of smeary Neo-Expressionist paintings by the actor Sylvester Stallone (who attended early on), and later when word spread that United States Marshals had seized several paintings from the booth just before the fair’s opening in connection with a legal problem involving the gallery, its insurance company and a consignor. (The gallery announced on Friday that the dispute had been resolved and the works returned.)

Deitch Projects has likewise been a source of buzz, for its immense equestrian portrait of Michael Jackson by Kehinde Wiley. In the painting, titled after a portrait of Philip II, two putti crown the windswept singer with a laurel wreath.

Deitch is also behind a series of exhibitions in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, organized in cooperation with Tony Goldman, a local developer. The best is an outdoor show of murals by Jim Drain and Ara Peterson, Os Gêmeos, Shepard Fairey and others. The works are eye-catching and give off as much energy as the young crowd they attract.

Other special projects outside the fair proper include an installation of gorgeous sculptures by Yayoi Kusama at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, in Coral Gables. It was a welcome change from the fair, if you had the time and energy to get there.

Also evolving is the New Art Dealers Alliance fair, or NADA, which has moved from downtown Miami to the Deauville resort north of South Beach. It is split into two sections, one dedicated to solo-artist displays and the other to the standard booth format (though single projects can be found here too, including a functioning pirate radio station by Tom Scicluna and Nicolas Lobo at Miami’s own Twenty Twenty).

The art, and its surroundings, seem designed to lift spirits. Stephan Stoyanov, for example, has a mirrored cabinet reflecting a soothing Alpine landscape, by the artist Ellen Harvey. Eleven Rivington has painted its booth a sunny yellow. Such efforts, and the move to the Deauville, seem to be working; several dealers, including Rental and Sunday, said they had sold out their booths.

The private collections, meanwhile, have not disappointed. The regulars were joined this year by the Jumex show, a splashy mix of classic Pop Art, Mexico City bricolage and international contemporary showpieces like Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset’s door marked “VIP.” The Rubell Family Collection is presenting a show, “Beg, Borrow and Steal,” highlighting various generations of appropriation art. Here, Cady Noland’s installation of beer cans meets its descendants, Rachel Harrison and Guyton/Walker, and Adam McEwen’s fake newspaper obituary of Richard Prince rubs shoulders with some of the Rubells’ many Princes.

Of course, in a fair environment, titles and themes don’t have much sway. At the end of the day it’s hard to remember whether that McEwen was at the Rubells’, the MoCA’s group show “The Reach of Realism” or Nicole Klagsbrun’s convention center booth.

Miami collectors being a fiercely competitive lot, the Rosa and Carlos de la Cruz Collection also has a large Guyton/Walker and a Rachel Harrison in its light-filled new space in the city’s Design District. Any regular visitor to Chelsea can see that a couple of galleries in particular — Greene Naftali and Anton Kern — have had a strong hold on the de la Cruzes. Only on the third floor, with its graceful mix of Ana Mendieta, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Jim Hodges, does the collectors’ own sensibility start to emerge.

There is more, much more, including a Guillermo Kuitca survey at the Miami Art Museum and, under the aegis of the big fair, a beachfront installation and performance stage by the artist Pae White. When markets contract, art fairs shrink — but only to a point.
182 2009-12-05 A New York City police officer has been accused of using his badge to help a friend run a cocaine-distribution operation, providing tips on which streets were lightly patrolled by officers and stealing cash from a rival drug courier in the guise of a police seizure, officials said Friday.

The officer, Juan Acosta, joined the Police Department in 2000 and had been assigned to the 43rd Precinct in the Soundview section of the Bronx until his arrest Thursday. He has resigned from the force, the police said.

Since at least 2005, Officer Acosta served as a kind of enforcer for his friend, Yorick Rafael Corneil-Perez, as they and others worked to distribute “multiple kilograms of cocaine” in and around the city, according to the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan.

The men, both 34 and from the Bronx, have been charged with participating in a cocaine-distribution conspiracy and with conspiring to commit extortion in connection with Officer Acosta’s improper use of his authority, a statement from the office said.

According to an indictment in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Officer Acosta used a police car in mid-2005 “to rob a drug courier of several hundred thousand dollars in cash derived from a drug deal” that involved Mr. Corniel-Perez. It was a ruse to make it look as if law enforcement authorities had seized the money, but Mr. Acosta and Mr. Corniel-Perez “took the cash,” the court papers said.
183 2009-12-05 NAIROBI, Kenya — A cholera epidemic is sweeping across Kenya, with 4,700 cases reported in the past month and 119 deaths in what Kenyan officials are calling “one of the worst outbreaks in a decade.”

The most stricken areas are the arid swaths of northern Kenya, which were hit this year by a devastating drought. The scant rains have meant that many people are surviving off dirty, germ-infested water, which is how cholera spreads.

The drought has also left thousands of people malnourished and weak, making them vulnerable to infectious diseases. Because of the remoteness of many of the infected areas, aid workers say they believe that the officially reported numbers of cases and deaths may vastly understate the severity of the outbreak.

“People are really sick, and coming down from the hills, and we really don’t know how bad this is yet,” Nicholas Wasunna, a humanitarian adviser for the aid group World Vision, said Friday.

Cholera, called kipindupindu in Kiswahili, is an acute diarrheal illness caused by a bacterial infection in the intestine. People exposed to cholera germs can get sick within hours and die within a day if the infection is not treated. Health officials say it spreads so easily that a person can get it simply by taking a sip from a cup used by an infected person.
184 2009-12-05 The little typewriter that clacked out about five million fairly renowned words over 50 years — with the able assistance of the novelist Cormac McCarthy — ended up being worth a lot more than anyone expected. The heavily weathered, light blue Lettera 32 Olivetti manual machine, below, that Mr. McCarthy said he bought in 1963 for $50 and used to type all his novels, including those that won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, sold on Friday at Christie’s to an unidentified American collector for $254,500, more than 10 times its high estimate of $20,000. (The price includes Christie’s commission.) The proceeds will be donated to the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit interdisciplinary scientific research organization. Glenn Horowitz, a rare-book dealer who handled the auction for Mr. McCarthy, told The New York Times earlier this week: “When I grasped that some of the most complex, almost otherworldly fiction of the postwar era was composed on such a simple, functional, frail-looking machine, it conferred a sort of talismanic quality to Cormac’s typewriter. It’s as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife.” Mr. McCarthy will not be using the opportunity to go digital after all these years. A friend of his recently bought him a replacement typewriter — the same Olivetti model — for less than $20.
185 2009-12-05 SAN FRANCISCO — In the most recent sign that Apple is looking at alternative ways for people to store and play their digital music, the company has agreed to buy Lala, a four-year-old start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., a person with knowledge of the deal said Friday.

Lala, unlike Apple’s iTunes, lets users play the music they own from the Web — or in tech industry parlance, from the cloud. If Apple introduces its own cloud-based streaming music service, it would let people skip having to download music they buy or synchronize their music collection between their computers and mobile devices.

A person’s music library would always be available on the Web and accessible on a PC, smartphone or other Web-connected mobile device.

Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, said the company “buys smaller technology companies all the time, and we generally do not comment on our purpose or plans.” A Lala representative could not be reached. News of a possible deal was first reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News and CNet, a technology news site. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“I am sure Apple is watching streaming music, the traction of Pandora, of course, and other streaming applications on the iPhone,” said David Goldberg, head of SurveyMonkey and the former general manager of Yahoo Music. “There’s a legitimate question here: Why should people have to download music?”
186 2009-12-05 BERLIN — Microsoft has agreed to reconfigure its Windows operating system in Europe to address two main complaints from rival Internet browser makers, a concession that could lead to the settlement of its latest antitrust case before the European Commission.

A person with knowledge of the commission’s plans said Microsoft had agreed to change the display of a ballot screen that European Union consumers would use to automatically download an Internet browser for their Windows-based computers.

Microsoft has agreed to randomly generate the logos of the major browser makers on the ballot screen, and to remove the Windows Internet Explorer logo from the screen frame, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the plan.

The changes were requested by Opera, a Norwegian browser maker, Mozilla and Google as preconditions to closing the case before European officials. Rival browser makers had been upset that Microsoft had planned to list the browser choices alphabetically, giving Apple’s Safari browser an advantage.

Microsoft’s Windows operates more than 90 percent of the world’s computers. In January, the commission decided that bundling Internet Explorer into Windows constituted an abuse of Microsoft’s market position.
187 2009-12-05 While both sides said they would essentially honor the old treaty after the deadline, one major change was clear: an American monitoring post in Russia that kept track of Russian missile production was closed on Friday.

The post, in the city of Votkinsk, 600 miles east of Moscow, was authorized under the old treaty, and Russia had blocked any effort to keep it under the new one or to provide for a temporary extension. The Russian military had long objected to the presence of American observers based in the heart of Russia.

Under the old treaty, the United States and Russia also had the right to use periodic inspection teams in the other country to guarantee that the treaty was being followed. In October, the Obama administration expressed concern that if the deadline for a new pact passed and official authority for inspections lapsed, the United States would be unable to monitor the Russian nuclear stockpile.

According to the understanding that was announced Friday by the two countries, they might conceivably be able to send ad hoc inspection teams in this interim period. But both countries seem to be hoping that it will not come to that — that a new treaty will be signed and ratified in time for an official inspection program to occur.

Over all, the outlines of the new treaty are already apparent. At a summit meeting in Moscow in July, Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev narrowed the range for a cap on warheads to between 1,500 and 1,675, down from about 2,200, which each side has now.

The two countries are also expected to lower the ceiling on delivery vehicles — intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-based missiles and strategic bombers — to below 800, from 1,600.

In Washington on Friday, Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said that after the deadline, the United States and Russia “will simply maintain where the agreement has been for the last 15 or 20 years” until a new treaty is approved.

A senior American official, who was not authorized to speak to the news media and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said negotiators in Geneva “are focusing on getting final issues solved” and expressed optimism that a new treaty would be completed in the coming days.

In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry also offered a positive take.

“The future treaty should become another milestone in disarmament and nonproliferation,” the ministry said, “marking the transition to a higher level of interaction between Russia and the United States and reaffirming the common goals of the two countries in the promotion of mutual and global security.”
188 2009-12-05 Stock markets rose sharply early Friday after the employment report was released and ended the day slightly higher, while the dollar had its biggest one-day rally since January.

Although 15.4 million people are struggling to find work, the November report revealed signs of improvement across the country. More than 50,000 temporary workers were hired, the first surge in months and often a precursor to companies hiring permanent workers. Employees worked more hours, even in manufacturing.

And, reflecting the increased hours, the average weekly wage for most of the nation’s workers rose by nearly two-thirds of a percentage point in a single month, to $622.

“Many companies have reached the point that they can’t extract more work from their existing employees,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. “That means they have to add hours for existing workers or add people. Just how many depends on how quickly the economy grows.”

It also depends on business executives feeling confident enough about the economy to invest and expand their operations. That may take months of steady economic growth even after they have stopped peeling back their work forces.

In the end, the unanticipated improvement in November may turn out to be partly a correction of too much bad news in October — particularly the unemployment rate, which shot up four-tenths of a percentage point that month and has retreated somewhat.

But economists in the Obama administration were having none of that. They see the November improvement as payback from the $787 billion stimulus package. In briefings with reporters, they said the federal spending saved or created 1.6 million jobs. Without that lift, the total job loss over the 23 months of recession would have been 8.8 million instead of 7.2 million.

“I think you have to give our interventions a lot of credit,” said Jared Bernstein, chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And then, insisting that Thursday’s job conference in Washington was a step along the way to more job creation activity, he said: “By no stretch of the imagination does this report mean less pressure on us for job creation.”

Republican economists were hardly as sanguine. “Even if you accept their analysis that we are creating jobs this year, when you remove the stimulus you are going to destroy jobs,” said Kevin A. Hassett, director of Economic Policy Studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and chief economist for John McCain in his failed presidential campaign. Mr. Hassett’s preferred tonic, like that of many Republicans, is tax cuts for job creation, not public spending.

Adding to the positive signs, a broad measure of unemployment — one that includes those forced to work only part time and those too discouraged to look for work — fell to 17.2 percent, from 17.5 percent in October, the first decline in several months. In addition, job losses in September and October turned out to be far less than previously reported: 250,000 instead of 409,000.

“All this good news is miles above the underlying trend rate of improvement, so we expect a correction in the next month or two,” Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics, said in a message to the firm’s clients.

Even without a correction, once the economy turns and hiring resumes, nearly 18 million people are likely to be vying for jobs, as if they were all trying at once to jam themselves through a door too narrow to accommodate more than a few. In a strong economy, the work force seldom grows by more than 300,000 workers a month.

Nearly one-third have an even greater burden. They are the long-term unemployed, out of work for six months or more, and in many cases longer than a year. Not since records were first kept in 1948 has the percentage of long-term unemployed been as high as it is today: 38.3 percent of all those seeking work, or more than 10 percentage points above the previous high, in the aftermath of the early 1980s recession.

“Assuming we have a strong recovery, it will take at least five years or more to get the unemployment rate down to a more normal 5 percent,” said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs, adding that the long-term unemployed have lost skills and some of the habits of work because of their extended idleness. Because of this, the nation may have to get used to an unemployment rate that seldom falls below 6 percent.

Annette Mercado, 39, a single mother in Chicago, said that she had retained her skills, even though she has been hunting for work since July of last year, when she was laid off from a $12-an-hour clerical job in a motorcycle accessory shop.

She attributes that layoff to her refusal to work extra hours. “I told them I wasn’t willing to spend more time away from my 14-year-old daughter,” Ms. Mercado said. She spent months scouring Craigslist, CareerBuilder and other job sites, but the best she could do, she said during an interview at the state unemployment office, was temporary holiday season work last December at a liquor store.

Ms. Mercado gets $984 a month in unemployment benefits as well as food stamps, but that is not really enough, she said, to pay all her expenses and those of her daughter without falling behind on the rent. Her plan, if work doesn’t materialize soon, is to put her belongings in storage and move in with her parents.

“They are barely making it themselves,” she said.
189 2009-12-05 BANGKOK — The highest court in Myanmar has agreed to consider an appeal by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the country’s battered democracy movement, over an 18-month extension of her longstanding house arrest, her lawyer said Friday.

The decision by the Supreme Court comes after a lower court’s rejection in October and coincides with tentative signs of a thawing of relations between the country’s military government and Western countries.

Lawyers will make an initial application on Dec. 21, and a judge will decide whether to grant a full hearing in front of the Supreme Court. A successful appeal raises the prospect that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi might be able to play a role in elections that the military government has pledged to hold sometime next year.

In a telephone interview, her lawyer, U Kyi Win, said the Dec. 21 hearing was largely procedural. “It’s a very routine matter,” he said. “It’s neither positive nor negative.”

Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been confined to her home for 14 of the past 20 years, was sentenced to an additional 18 months of house arrest in August for allowing a foreigner into her home. Mr. Kyi Win said he would argue that the laws used to convict his client, a Nobel Peace laureate, were from the 1974 Constitution, which he claims is no longer in force as the country is under military rule.

194 2009-12-06 Portland center Greg Oden needs surgery and will probably miss the rest of the season after fracturing his left patella during a game against Houston. Oden fell to the floor clutching his left knee after colliding with Aaron Brooks midway through the first quarter.

The No. 1 pick in the 2007 draft, Oden missed the 2007-8 season after having microfracture surgery on his right knee.

NUGGETS 106, SPURS 99 Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points and Denver ran away from host San Antonio in the fourth quarter. Chauncey Billups had 18 points for the Nuggets, who took the lead in the fourth after trailing most of the game. Tony Parker scored 27 points for the Spurs, who lost their second straight.

TIMBERWOLVES 108, JAZZ 101 Kevin Love has not shown signs of rust from his five weeks on the sideline with a broken left hand. In his second game back, Love had 18 points and 10 rebounds to help lead host Minnesota to its third victory in 20 games.

195 2009-12-06 Let’s start with Wal-Mart. Obviously, a business can save money by finding ways to spend less while maintaining sales. This is what Wal-Mart did with fuel costs, which the company reduced by $26 million per year simply by changing the way it managed its enormous truck fleet. Instead of running a truck’s engine all night to heat or cool the cab during mandatory 10-hour rest stops, the company installed small auxiliary power units to do the job. In addition to lowering fuel costs, the move eliminated the carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 18,300 passenger vehicles off the road.

Wal-Mart is also working to double the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 2015, thereby saving more than $200 million a year at the pump. Among the efficient prototypes now being tested are trucks that burn biofuels generated from waste grease at Wal-Mart’s delis. Similarly, as the country’s biggest private user of electricity, Wal-Mart is saving money by decreasing store energy use.

Another Wal-Mart example involves lowering costs associated with packaging materials. Wal-Mart now sells only concentrated liquid laundry detergents in North America, which has reduced the size of packaging by up to 50 percent. Wal-Mart stores also have machines called bailers that recycle plastics that once would have been discarded. Wal-Mart’s eventual goal is to end up with no packaging waste.

One last Wal-Mart example shows how a company can save money in the long run by buying from sustainably managed sources. Because most wild fisheries are managed unsustainably, prices for Chilean sea bass and Atlantic tuna have been soaring. To my pleasant astonishment, in 2006 Wal-Mart decided to switch, within five years, all its purchases of wild-caught seafood to fisheries certified as sustainable.

Coca-Cola’s problems are different from Wal-Mart’s in that they are largely long-term. The key ingredient in Coke products is water. The company produces its beverages in about 200 countries through local franchises, all of which require a reliable local supply of clean fresh water.

But water supplies are under severe pressure around the world, with most already allocated for human use. The little remaining unallocated fresh water is in remote areas unsuitable for beverage factories, like Arctic Russia and northwestern Australia.

Coca-Cola can’t meet its water needs just by desalinizing seawater, because that requires energy, which is also increasingly expensive. Global climate change is making water scarcer, especially in the densely populated temperate-zone countries, like the United States, that are Coca-Cola’s main customers. Most competing water use around the world is for agriculture, which presents sustainability problems of its own.

Hence Coca-Cola’s survival compels it to be deeply concerned with problems of water scarcity, energy, climate change and agriculture. One company goal is to make its plants water-neutral, returning to the environment water in quantities equal to the amount used in beverages and their production. Another goal is to work on the conservation of seven of the world’s river basins, including the Rio Grande, Yangtze, Mekong and Danube — all of them sites of major environmental concerns besides supplying water for Coca-Cola.

These long-term goals are in addition to Coca-Cola’s short-term cost-saving environmental practices, like recycling plastic bottles, replacing petroleum-based plastic in bottles with organic material, reducing energy consumption and increasing sales volume while decreasing water use.

The third company is Chevron. Not even in any national park have I seen such rigorous environmental protection as I encountered in five visits to new Chevron-managed oil fields in Papua New Guinea. (Chevron has since sold its stake in these properties to a New Guinea-based oil company.) When I asked how a publicly traded company could justify to its shareholders its expenditures on the environment, Chevron employees and executives gave me at least five reasons.

First, oil spills can be horribly expensive: it is far cheaper to prevent them than to clean them up. Second, clean practices reduce the risk that New Guinean landowners become angry, sue for damages and close the fields. (The company has been sued for problems in Ecuador that Chevron inherited when it merged with Texaco in 2001.) Next, environmental standards are becoming stricter around the world, so building clean facilities now minimizes having to do expensive retrofitting later.

Also, clean operations in one country give a company an advantage in bidding on leases in other countries. Finally, environmental practices of which employees are proud improve morale, help with recruitment and increase the length of time employees are likely to remain at the company.

In view of all those advantages that businesses gain from environmentally sustainable policies, why do such policies face resistance from some businesses and many politicians? The objections often take the form of one-liners.

 We have to balance the environment against the economy. The assumption underlying this statement is that measures promoting environmental sustainability inevitably yield a net economic cost rather than a profit. This line of thinking turns the truth upside down. Economic reasons furnish the strongest motives for sustainability, because in the long run (and often in the short run as well) it is much more expensive and difficult to try to fix problems, environmental or otherwise, than to avoid them at the outset.

Americans learned that lesson from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, when, as a result of government agencies balking for a decade at spending several hundred million dollars to fix New Orleans’s defenses, we suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in damage — not to mention thousands of dead Americans. Likewise, John Holdren, the top White House science adviser, estimates that solving problems of climate change would cost the United States 2 percent of our gross domestic product by the year 2050, but that not solving those problems would damage the economy by 20 percent to 30 percent of G.D.P.

 Technology will solve our problems. Yes, technology can contribute to solving problems. But major technological advances require years to develop and put in place, and regularly turn out to have unanticipated side effects — consider the destruction of the atmosphere’s ozone layer by the nontoxic, nonflammable chlorofluorocarbons initially hailed for replacing poisonous refrigerant gases.

 World population growth is leveling off and won’t be the problem that we used to fear. It’s true that the rate of world population growth has been decreasing. However, the real problem isn’t people themselves, but the resources that people consume and the waste that they produce. Per-person average consumption rates and waste production rates, now 32 times higher in rich countries than in poor ones, are rising steeply around the world, as developing countries emulate industrialized nations’ lifestyles.

 It’s futile to preach to us Americans about lowering our standard of living: we will never sacrifice just so other people can raise their standard of living. This conflates consumption rates with standards of living: they are only loosely correlated, because so much of our consumption is wasteful and doesn’t contribute to our quality of life. Once basic needs are met, increasing consumption often doesn’t increase happiness.

Replacing a car that gets 15 miles per gallon with a more efficient model wouldn’t lower one’s standard of living, but would help improve all of our lives by reducing the political and military consequences of our dependence on imported oil. Western Europeans have lower per-capita consumption rates than Americans, but enjoy a higher standard of living as measured by access to medical care, financial security after retirement, infant mortality, life expectancy, literacy and public transport.

NOT surprisingly, the problem of climate change has attracted its own particular crop of objections.

 Even experts disagree about the reality of climate change. That was true 30 years ago, and some experts still disagreed a decade ago. Today, virtually every climatologist agrees that average global temperatures, warming rates and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are higher than at any time in the earth’s recent past, and that the main cause is greenhouse gas emissions by humans. Instead, the questions still being debated concern whether average global temperatures will increase by 13 degrees or “only” by 4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050, and whether humans account for 90 percent or “only” 85 percent of the global warming trend.

 The magnitude and cause of global climate change are uncertain. We shouldn’t adopt expensive countermeasures until we have certainty. In other spheres of life — picking a spouse, educating our children, buying life insurance and stocks, avoiding cancer and so on — we admit that certainty is unattainable, and that we must decide as best we can on the basis of available evidence. Why should the impossible quest for certainty paralyze us solely about acting on climate change? As Mr. Holdren, the White House adviser, expressed it, not acting on climate change would be like being “in a car with bad brakes driving toward a cliff in the fog.”

 Global warming will be good for us, by letting us grow crops in places formerly too cold for agriculture. The term “global warming” is a misnomer; we should instead talk about global climate change, which isn’t uniform. The global average temperature is indeed rising, but many areas are becoming drier, and frequencies of droughts, floods and other extreme weather events are increasing. Some areas will be winners, while others will be losers. Most of us will be losers, because the temperate zones where most people live are becoming drier.

It’s useless for the United States to act on climate change, when we don’t know what China will do. Actually, China will arrive at this week’s Copenhagen climate change negotiations with a whole package of measures to reduce its “carbon intensity.”

While the United States is dithering about long-distance energy transmission from our rural areas with the highest potential for wind energy generation to our urban areas with the highest need for energy, China is far ahead of us. It is developing ultra-high-voltage transmission lines from wind and solar generation sites in rural western China to cities in eastern China. If America doesn’t act to develop innovative energy technology, we will lose the green jobs competition not only to Finland and Germany (as we are now) but also to China.

On each of these issues, American businesses are going to play as much or more of a role in our progress as the government. And this isn’t a bad thing, as corporations know they have a lot to gain by establishing environmentally friendly business practices.

My friends in the business world keep telling me that Washington can help on two fronts: by investing in green research, offering tax incentives and passing cap-and-trade legislation; and by setting and enforcing tough standards to ensure that companies with cheap, dirty standards don’t have a competitive advantage over those businesses protecting the environment. As for the rest of us, we should get over the misimpression that American business cares only about immediate profits, and we should reward companies that work to keep the planet healthy.
196 2009-12-06 Janka’s time of 1 minute 43.49 seconds was two-hundredths of a second faster than Cuche, who was two-hundredths of a second ahead of Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway.

Another skier who took the summer off from training, the American Bode Miller, had by far his best result this season. He finished fourth with a stirring, if scary, descent down the rock-hard racecourse. It was a classic Miller run, filled with a series of linked recoveries made necessary by a daredevil charge. At one point Miller pawed at the snow with his left hand to keep himself upright in the midst of an off-balance turn at about 70 miles per hour.

“That was inspirational,” Sasha Rearick, the United States men’s ski coach, said.

Miller, 32, proved that although his fitness level may be lacking, his confidence is not.

“I made two significant mistakes,” he said, “but if I had skied clean there’s no question in my mind I would be on top of the podium.”

Over all, it was a promising day for the American men after a disappointing showing last weekend at Lake Louise, Alberta. Andrew Weibrecht continued his rapid rise in the World Cup downhill rankings with an 11th-place finish. Marco Sullivan finished 15th and Erik Fisher 25th.

It was the Swiss team’s second consecutive day dominating the Austrian team, the usual ruling power of Alpine racing. Swiss skiers have been on the World Cup podium seven times this season with four victories, one second place and two thirds. The Austrians have one victory, one second and one third.

Cuche, who labored through several seasons when the once-mighty Swiss skiers struggled, said he was not happy that the Austrians were skiing more slowly but he added, with a smile, “Hopefully, they have a longer time not winning than we did.”

For two days now at Beaver Creek, Janka has been at a loss to explain his recent success.

“I have a plan in the start house and I try to keep to it and that’s worked so far,” he said. “I have been at this it seems like for 23 years.”

The 35-year-old Cuche offered another insight on his teammate.

“In the start, Carlo doesn’t get nervous,” Cuche said. “He is the Iceman.”

Rearick said he was encouraged by his team’s attitude.

“You could see it a little in the body language as they skied,” Rearick said. “It was aggressive and tactically smart. It was a strong step forward.”

For Miller, the long layoff from skiing when he was in semiretirement continues to affect his performances.

“But slowly, my stamina is coming back,” he said.

Svindal and Cuche marveled at Miller’s run. “I think maybe it is a good thing for us that he didn’t work out at all this summer,” Svindal said

VONN WINS AGAIN IN ALBERTA Lindsey Vonn won a World Cup downhill at Lake Louise, Alberta, for the second straight day, giving her seven victories on the course in six years.

Vonn was timed in 1:50.06 and was followed by Maria Riesch of Germany and Emily Brydon of Canada. (AP)
197 2009-12-06 Rafael Nadal, the four-time French Open champion, beat Berdych in Friday’s singles. He missed last year’s final victory at Argentina on a carpet designed to stop the Spanish mastery of clay.

“First thing, you have to have good players,” Nadal said of his team’s prowess. “In Spain, we have a lot. Sure, last year was disappointing for me not to be there, but for sure the team was better. They play unbelievable and they won, so they did much better without me than with me.”

Stepanek said, “To win four times in nine years, it shows how strong Spanish tennis is in general. The team is so strong, you have four players now in the team but you can build up a second team that is nearly as strong.”

Spain took advantage of Berdych’s shaky serve for three of its four breaks. Verdasco overcame early jitters to help clinch the title by scoring two crucial breaks, including in the 14th game of the second set.

The ninth-ranked Verdasco won the deciding singles match in Argentina last year.

The Czech captain, Jaroslav Navratil, selected Berdych and Stepanek — who were 5-0 in Davis Cup doubles coming into the match — although each lost his singles match on Friday. They replaced Lukas Dlouhy and Jan Hajek.

On Friday, Stepanek blew a two-set advantage in a four-hour defeat to David Ferrer.

Spain is unbeaten on clay in 20 straight series and has not lost at home since 1999 — a run of 18 opponents.

The Spanish team prides itself on its unity in a country where allegiances can sometimes divide along regional lines.

Costa made a point of bringing Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo to the news conference because they also played a part this year.

López said: “I think to play for our country, for all of us, it’s very special. It’s an extra motivation that we all have.”
198 2009-12-06 A limited run of designer jeans labeled “Made in North Korea” went on sale late last week at the trendy Stockholm department store PUB, the first foray into Western fashion for the reclusive Communist state.

Marketed under the Noko brand by three 20-something Swedish entrepreneurs, the jeans sell for 1,500 kronor ($220), more than two year’s wages for the average North Korean. No matter, jeans are banned in the country as a symbol of United States imperialism.

Noko’s founders spent more than a year trying to get into the planet’s last Stalinist state. It probably didn’t hurt that Sweden is one of only seven countries to have an embassy there. But once inside, their difficulties continued.

“There is a political gap, a mental gap and an economic gap,” Jacob Astrom, one of the Swedish businessmen, told Reuters.

They were rebuffed by North Korea’s biggest textile operation before striking a deal with North Korea’s largest mining company, which has a small textile subsidiary. They sealed the contract to produce 1,100 pairs of jeans over shots of Swedish vodka and handshakes.

“What really motivated us wasn’t the money but to open doors,” Jakob Ohlsson, another of the entrepreneurs, told The Associated Press. “There are normal people there, but all we’ve really seen from it is their military marches on TV.”
199 2009-12-06 They provide a staggering arsenal of functions and tools at the swipe of a finger: e-mail and text messaging, video and photography, maps and turn-by-turn navigation, media and books, music and games, mobile shopping, and even wireless keys that remotely unlock cars.

“Apple changed the view of what you can do with that small phone in your back pocket,” says Katy Huberty, a Morgan Stanley analyst. “Applications make the smartphone trend a revolutionary trend — one we haven’t seen in consumer technology for many years.”

Ms. Huberty likens the advent of the App Store and the iPhone to AOL’s pioneering role in driving broad-based consumer adoption of the Internet in the 1990s. She also draws comparisons to ways in which laptops have upended industry assumptions about consumer preferences and desktop computing. But, she notes, something even more profound may now be afoot.

“The iPhone is something different. It’s changing our behavior,” she says. “The game that Apple is playing is to become the Microsoft of the smartphone market.”

The popularity of Apple’s app model has reached a fever pitch. Tens of thousands of independent developers are clamoring to write programs for it, and the App Store’s virtual shelves are stocked with more than 100,000 applications. Apple recently said that consumers had downloaded more than two billion applications from its store.

Major players like Research in Motion (maker of the BlackBerry), Palm (maker of the Pre), Google (maker of the Android mobile operating system) and Microsoft (maker of Windows Mobile) are taking note and scrambling to replicate the App Store frenzy.

App fever has even prompted cities like New York and San Francisco to open reservoirs of city data to the public to spur software developers to create hyperlocal applications for computers and phones.

One need not look further than the lobby of Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., to see that the iPhone and applications that run on it are centerpieces of the company’s mobile strategy. Planted squarely in the lobby of the main office, at 1 Infinite Loop, is an impressive, 24-foot-wide array built out of 20 LED screens populated with 20,000 tiny, brightly colored icons.

As Philip W. Schiller, head of worldwide product marketing at Apple, describes how the wall works — each time an application is purchased, the corresponding icon on the electronic billboard jiggles, causing its neighbors to ripple in unison — he, too, becomes animated.

Normally reserved and on message, Mr. Schiller waves his hands back and forth and allows his voice to ascend into giddy registers as he speaks about the potential unleashed by the App Store.

“I absolutely think this is the future of great software development and distribution,” Mr. Schiller says. “The idea that anyone, all the way from an individual to a large company, can create software that is innovative and be carried around in a customer’s pocket is just exploding. It’s a breakthrough, and that is the future, and every software developer sees it.”

APPLE cloaks most of its inner workings in a shroud of secrecy — a tactic that has helped preserve the company’s mystique and generate intense interest in its product rollouts.

But the App Store relies on vast cadres of outside developers to populate its virtual shelves with products, leaving Apple in the unfamiliar and at times uncomfortable position of having to collaborate with folks who haven’t drunk the company’s corporate Kool-Aid.

This has led Apple to be deeply supportive of developers once shunned by big telecommunications companies, while also frustrating many of them more recently with what developers see as the company’s inscrutable and arbitrary process for accepting programs into the App Store.

“I think, by and large, we do a very good job there,” Mr. Schiller said. “Sometimes we make a judgment call both ways, that people give us feedback on, either rejecting something that perhaps on second consideration shouldn’t be, or accepting something that on second consideration shouldn’t be.”

For Apple, the review process is a necessary evil. The company places high value on what it describes as “customer trust,” or the idea that users have faith that an application distributed on the iPhone won’t crash the platform, steal personal information or contain illegal content.

Mr. Schiller says the majority of applications sail through the review with no difficulty, and those that do require greater scrutiny are largely those that are slowed down by bugs or glitches in the coding.

“We care deeply about the feedback, both good and bad,” he says. “While there are some complaints, they are just a small fraction of what happens in the process.”

Apple says it receives more than 10,000 application submissions each week. Most become available in the App Store within two weeks (creating yet another problem: the difficulty consumers have in efficiently and effectively trolling through 100,000 apps to find hidden gems they hadn’t known about).

Still, the App Store is markedly better than the alternative, says Peter Farago, a marketing executive at Flurry, a mobile analytics company in San Francisco. Gone are the days when mobile developers had to negotiate with major telecommunications companies if they had any hopes of publishing their applications on a mobile phone.

“It took six to nine months to build a relationship with a carrier, maybe a quarter-million to get the infrastructure built, and the company took 50 percent or more from each dollar,” Mr. Farago says, a process that limited access to mobile platforms. “Apple has helped create a much healthier middle class of developers and expanded the pie for everyone.”

Apple pockets 30 percent of the revenue earned by any App Store program, with developers keeping the balance. Although barriers to entry for software developers have dropped considerably, Mr. Farago acknowledges that “friction points have changed.”

Developers now cite instances in which applications have been held in approval limbo, neither accepted nor rejected for months. And as bigger companies begin churning out programs, the smaller, garage-size outfits worry that they will be squeezed out.

FreedomVoice Systems, a company in San Diego, couldn’t wait to roll out a mobile version of its telephone software for the iPhone. The company submitted an application to the App Store last year and excitedly waited. And waited. And kept waiting.

“We’re facing 396 days with no contact from Apple,” says Eric Thomas, chief executive of FreedomVoice. “The app has been ‘pending’ in the App Store for a year.”

Mr. Thomas says he understands that it is Apple’s decision whether to accept his app. “But the idea they wouldn’t tell us it was a no — or even why — so we could try to do something about it,” he said, “is a very strange and unneighborly approach.”

Freeverse, which Mr. Smith founded in 1994, also creates games and desktop programs for computers. But like legions of other software developers, the company shifted its focus to the iPhone as the popularity of the device skyrocketed. But that doesn’t mean it’s been an easy road to riches.

“For our size and seriousness, we are still treated like a college freshman who is doing this as a side project,” Mr. Smith says. “The trade-off being that there is a much lower barrier to entry for developers. Anyone can have a shot.”

No one knows that better than Cerulean Studios, a software firm in Brookfield, Conn. After e-mail generated only automated responses from Apple for three months, Cerulean got a call in November from an Apple employee.

“He didn’t say much, just that our app would be going live in the App Store that afternoon,” recalls Scott Werndorfer, a co-founder of Cerulean. “We knew what we were getting into with Apple. They want everything to be pixel perfect, and you have to play ball by their rules.”

Some Apple developers are willing to go to greater lengths — underground — to avoid dealing with Apple’s policies and to get their software out quickly and on their own terms. To do that, they create programs for “jailbroken” iPhones and iPod Touches. Such devices are modified to allow anyone to upload a program onto them, which Apple says is illegal.

“Developers are just tired of the review process and navigating opaque hurdles,” says Mario Ciabarra, who operates Rock Your Phone, an online storefront containing a small catalog of applications for jailbroken iPhones. “They’ve been defecting to the jailbroken community or other platforms, such as Android. That demand has created the marketplace for our products and attracted developers.”

Mr. Ciabarra says about 1.5 million iPhones have visited his storefront, an impressive figure though still a small fraction of the 50 million iPhones and iPod Touches that Apple says it has sold.

As the App Store has matured, so has the need to come up with more sophisticated ways to profit from it. Simply having a great application is not enough. Bart Decrem, chief executive of Tapulous, a start-up company that publishes musical rhythm games, recalls the early days when it was enough to develop a shiny application that used the iPhone.

The company’s first game, Tap Tap Revenge, was available in the App Store when it opened in 2008. It quickly climbed the store’s charts, and Apple eventually ranked it as the most popular free iPhone game that year.

These days, Mr. Decrem says, that kind of instant and relatively easy success is much rarer because more companies are competing in the App Store. They include giant game publishers like Electronic Arts, which recently released a version of its popular video game Rock Band for the iPhone.

“It’s still the Wild West, but the stakes are higher,” Mr. Decrem says.

Tapulous has begun working with record labels and musicians to introduce paid special editions of Tap Tap Revenge featuring big-name artists. “Simply selling applications is ultimately not a scalable model,” he says.

IT’S unclear how concerned Apple is about some of the tensions swirling around the App Store. The company’s App Store policies have faced criticism — and even prompted a Federal Communications Commission investigation of Apple’s decision to reject an iPhone application developed by Google, which is still under way. Critics say they wonder whether the company can be trusted to maintain a fair marketplace, especially when developers release products that could compete with Apple’s current or future line of products.

Apple runs the App Store under the aegis of its iTunes unit (the operation that, wedded to the iPod, transformed music downloading in a way that analysts say the App Store, wedded to the iPhone, is now transforming mobile computing).

“A rocket ship is even too small of an analogy,” says Eddy Cue, Apple’s vice president for iTunes, of the App Store’s popularity. “We’ve been able to leverage a lot of our iTunes technology for the App Store. But it’s completely different. We’re reviewing all of those apps. We really don’t have to review each and every song.”

Apple executives are quick to point out the importance of ensuring that third-party applications run smoothly and provide a high-quality experience for users.

“Our goal is very simple: We want to have the best platform for applications that there has ever been on any product,” notes Mr. Schiller, the marketing executive. “We know we’re not perfect, but we know we’re better than anything else that has been and we want to keep improving it.”

Apple says it has increased the number of product reviewers working on the App Store and has tried to improve and streamline the way it communicates with developers.

The App Store’s success — as much a surprise to Apple as it has been to competitors — has given rise to a new digital ecosystem. Today, hundreds of software aspirants, from individuals tinkering in their bedrooms late at night to established companies looking for lucrative new revenue streams, are jumping into the App Store fray.

And smartphone manufacturers across the board are trying to make their platforms more attractive and lucrative to bring in the kind of creativity and enthusiasm that Apple has.

It’s easy to see why: Although Apple doesn’t release specific financial figures for the App Store, analysts estimate that it generates as much as a billion dollars a year in revenue for Apple and its developers.

At a recent conference in San Francisco organized by Research in Motion for BlackBerry developers, the company said it would make several changes to its mobile operating system to increase the kinds of applications developers can create for its devices, including allowing advertising and e-commerce within applications. Jim Balsillie, a co-chief executive of Research in Motion, says he isn’t focusing on the sheer number of apps available on a BlackBerry (3,000) but on their utility.

“Is it about 20,000 apps or 200,000 apps or is it about changing those 20,000 apps and their deep integration and how they interrelate to one another?” asks Mr. Balsillie. “We’re much more interested in changing the applications and changing the user experience and really unlocking the promise and the money and revenue opportunity for the ecosystem.”

Regardless, says Mr. Balsillie, apps and smartphones have created a new playing field.

“It’s inevitable that all cellphones will be smartphones,” he says. “There will be more services and new ways to monetize and more consumption. Growth is a given; it’s just a question of who is going to innovate in the right way to drive that value proposition to capture that growth.”

ALTHOUGH Palm is still rolling out the e-commerce portion of its own app store, called the App Catalog, the company hopes to draw developers to write for Palm devices like the Pre because Palm’s operating system, called webOS, is based largely on the same programming languages used to create Web sites — meaning developers are already familiar with the tools they will need to create mobile apps.

So far, however, Palm offers 500 applications, a relatively slim selection compared with the iPhone, and many analysts believe that this has made the device less attractive to consumers. Palm, like Research in Motion, says it doesn’t need an avalanche of applications to compete.

“Two years ago, the iPhone blew away expectations for what mobile devices are capable of. And mobile devices and applications are the future of the computing industry,” says Ben Galbraith, co-director of Palm’s developer relations team. “But the market is becoming saturated with a large volume of applications. When you’re number 50,000 out of 200,000, how do you survive?”

Palm says it is offering a breezier review process to developers — including allowing them the option of submitting their programs as candidates for Palm’s App Catalog or immediately publishing their applications in a third-party, online storefront — which may help it avoid some of the conflicts plaguing Apple’s relationship with developers.

Meanwhile, Microsoft, which analysts have criticized for its sluggish approach to the smartphone market, also says it is emphasizing quality for the application store it introduced in October, Windows Marketplace for Mobile.

“Our strategy is to look holistically at how we can provide the best all-around user experience,” says Victoria Grady, director of mobile strategy at Microsoft. The Marketplace now has more than 800 apps.

Many developers and analysts think Google’s mobile operating system, most recently placed in the Motorola Droid, may evolve into the fiercest competitor to the iPhone. Unlike Apple, Google has eschewed a review process, allowing any developer to publish an application to the Android Marketplace, its version of the App Store, instantly. About 14,000 applications are available for Android-powered smartphones.

“We’re doing everything we can to open the device to both developers and consumers,” says Eric Chu, group manager of the Android platform at Google. “That is a critical part of what we think makes Android unique: applications are no longer limited to a single device.”

Mr. Chu said the growing number of Android-powered phones available on multiple wireless carriers increases the financial opportunity for developers. “Last year at this time, we only had one device,” he says. “The volume is going up at a tremendous pace, and the developer ecosystem is seeing that.”

Besides being a business opportunity for all of these companies, apps offerings may also be a matter of survival in a make-or-break market. Apple has another strong advantage: the iPhone offers developers a uniform, standard platform.

“When we create an application for the iPhone, you know it’s going to run exactly as you tested it on every single model,” says David Lieb, co-founder of Bump Technologies, which creates software that lets users share contact information by tapping two phones together. “The same isn’t true for the rest of the smartphones, which have varying screen sizes, processor speeds and form factors.”

HOWEVER the competitive landscape shapes up, the App Store phenomenon shows no signs of slowing. IDC, a technology research firm, predicts that the number of iPhone apps will triple next year, fueled by the growing popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices. Along the way, analysts say, the App Store will continue to upend the architecture of the smartphone business and threaten competitors that don’t have vibrant and extensive offerings.

The way the industry once operated, “Each handset company would come up with its latest iterations and maybe have the hottest device of the season or not,” says Ms. Huberty, the Morgan Stanley analyst. “Enter apps into the equation, and that changes. It goes from being a product cycle game to a platform game.”

“People will look back on the iPhone as a turning point in the industry,” says Craig Moffett, a telecom analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “The iPhone will be remembered as the first true handheld computer.”
200 2009-12-06 “I am awestruck by this,” the MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, who had fun with the Woods animation on his show, wrote in an e-mail message. He was both appalled by the video and convinced that it was a harbinger of the future. “Yes,” he wrote, “this will be done by somebody, in this country, within six months.”

The production values are not exactly Pixar-quality, and Ms. Li conceded that the designers were not so successful in capturing Mr. Woods’s appearance, though she said, “We got the skin color and hairstyle right.”

Despite these obvious flaws, and a Chinese-only soundtrack, the Tiger Woods animation video has achieved global fame in the week since it went online. There have been more than 1.7 million views on YouTube alone.

The ethical pitfalls in the videos are hard to miss. Ken A. Bode, a former national political correspondent for NBC News who is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s ombudsman, corrected a reporter who called the Woods video a “re-enactment.”

“That’s a creation,” he said. “How does any Taiwanese journalist know what happened between Tiger Woods and his wife?”

Mr. Woods, who, after the accident, acknowledged “transgressions” in his relationship with his wife, wrote on his blog that “the stories in particular that physical violence played any role in the car accident were utterly false and malicious.” Attempts to reach Mr. Woods for this article were unsuccessful.

Ms. Li, who manages those who write the scripts for the animated stories, said she believed that viewers understood what they were seeing. “Readers can differentiate that it is an illustration,” she said. “All of it was based on what was reported on the wires, on other Web sites.”

Apple Daily was introduced to Taiwan in 2003 by the tycoon Jimmy Lai, who publishes an older and more famous Apple Daily in Hong Kong. In addition to their sensationalist articles, Mr. Lai’s publications are known for being willing to needle the mainland Chinese government.

Most of the animated stories produced by Next Media are local news (typically 10 daily stories from Hong Kong, and 10 daily stories from Taiwan, with a few international ones), Ms. Li said. Recent offerings from Taiwan include a story about a man attacking his grandmother, with a close-up of his foot stomping her. Another, with more than 100,000 views on YouTube, tells the story of a man who cut himself, then took an ambulance to drive to the hospital after scuffling with the ambulance driver.

“When a story happens, my team reports the story, gets the material, discusses the story with our sister company, an animation company,” Ms. Li said. “Their staff will draw up a story board.”

Actors often play the people described in the story, including Mr. Woods and his wife, Elin Nordegren, she said, so that animators can capture the motion for the virtual characters to imitate.

The project has already faced sharp criticism in Taiwan, not for ethical lapses but for its depiction of violence and sex.

The city government in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, recently fined Apple Daily $30,000 for violating a law protecting young people from exposure to obscenity on the Internet and banned the publication from city schools and libraries. (The line between print newspaper and video reports is quite porous: a bar code included in some newspaper articles can link cellphone users to the animated videos.) The newspaper initially bristled but later accepted the fine and agreed to print a warning about its content.

But fresh from the unexpected success of the Tiger Woods video, the media company has been delving into international news more, Ms. Li said.

Not surprisingly, there is already a new Tiger Woods animated story showing him texting a woman said to be a girlfriend and meeting her in a nightclub, where he dances awkwardly.

“From our side, we have more work now,” Ms. Li said in an interview from Taipei. “There is international attention. We have to improve the quality. There are definitely a lot of opportunities.”

She said the animation project had been more than two years in the planning, part of Mr. Lai’s vision to make news more relevant to young people.

“There was a lot of discussion of the future of newspapers; the print version of newspapers is shrinking,” she said, adding, “The young people don’t like to read the newspaper.”

Such computer-animated videos have found a utility beyond tabloid news. In the trial in Italy of the American college student Amanda Knox, which ended Friday in murder convictions for her and her Italian former boyfriend, prosecutors played a video-game-like animation to the jury showing how they believed her housemate was killed.

Gert K. Nielsen, a Danish news graphic consultant, said he considered himself part of a minority that viewed the story in a news illustration more important than getting every detail correct.

“If you don’t know if the neighbor’s car is red or black, that shouldn’t stop you from doing a graphic,” he said. But with its made-up story and use of “thought balloons” to describe what Ms. Nordegren was thinking, he said, “I think that the guys at Apple Daily are too crazy even for my taste.”
201 2009-12-06 Towers, 48, will be the best connected of all the job seekers. He does not need a stack of résumés in his briefcase. Towers had the longest tenure of any general manager when he was fired, and he has spoken to half the teams about helping as an adviser next season.

“He should get the next G.M. job that opens,” said Jack Zduriencik, the Seattle Mariners’ general manager. “If you want somebody who’s talented, experienced and honest, why wouldn’t you look at Kevin Towers? He would get my highest recommendation as a person, and his track record speaks for itself.”

The Mariners will meet with Towers in Indianapolis. So will the Yankees, the Mets, the Boston Red Sox and probably more. Towers knows better than to schedule his appointments too far in advance.

“I know what it’s like,” Towers said. “You start getting pestered with calls. ‘Hey, can you slot me in?’ You never know what your schedule is going to be like. Theo, Cash, Omar and Jack all know I’m going to be there.”

Zduriencik hired Towers as a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1991. Towers groomed Theo Epstein, the Red Sox’ general manager, when Epstein worked for the Padres. The Yankees’ Brian Cashman and the Mets’ Omar Minaya are among Towers’s closest friends in baseball.

Since the last weekend of the regular season, only two general manager jobs have opened. The Padres replaced Towers with Jed Hoyer, a Red Sox assistant, and the Toronto Blue Jays promoted Alex Anthopoulos after firing J. P. Ricciardi.

Towers built four playoff teams, including the 1998 National League pennant winner, and said he was surprised to be dismissed. He had followed orders to slash payroll, patching together a team that went 37-25 down the stretch and did not have any bad contracts. Minaya was among the first to call.

“He was in a good mood,” Minaya said. “When you do this job, sometimes you just need a break. He told me: ‘You know what? It’s time to enjoy myself.’ He said the last thing he wanted to do was go into an office. He just wants to be out there and scout.”

Towers, a former first-round draft pick from Brigham Young, pitched in the Padres’ system until arm surgery effectively ended his playing career in 1988. He scouted for San Diego and Pittsburgh before returning to the Padres, first as the scouting director and then as the general manager in 1995.

The Padres did not produce much homegrown talent, but Towers made shrewd trades for Kevin Brown, Adrian Gonzalez, Heath Bell and others. He approached the winter meetings aggressively.

“I never felt I was going to the winter meetings to have clubs propose deals to me,” Towers said. “I always wanted to propose deals, get out front, get the conversations going. I liked to move quickly.”

Now he wants to move at a slower pace, he said, at least for a year. Ideally, Towers said, he would work in the American League, to see how those teams are constructed and what skills they value. Almost any team would allow him to experience life with a higher payroll.

Towers was a bargain hunter with the Padres, collecting scraps after richer teams signed the splashy free agents. With the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Mets or the Mariners, he could consider a broader range of players.

“That information-gathering is exciting for me; it gets the adrenaline flowing,” Towers said. “But I don’t mind being a sixth man or extra guy, either. I had that role before I was ever a G.M. I don’t mind being a good listener and just seeing how another G.M. works. I’ve always wanted to see how someone else does it.”

Towers’s presence, even as an adviser, could seem threatening to a vulnerable general manager. But Cashman and Epstein have recently won championships, Zduriencik had a strong first season in Seattle, and Minaya is signed through 2012.

For now, Towers said, he wants to help and he wants to learn. He is proud of his work in San Diego but eager to be better for his next opportunity.

“I have that desire and that passion,” he said. “As much as I’ve enjoyed the time off, once spring training starts, I’m going to be itching to be out there evaluating players and reading box scores every day. It’s still in my blood.”
202 2009-12-06 THE downtown market has the largest inventory of unsold luxury properties in Manhattan, but brokers say deals are being done on some of the most talked-about places in some of the most sought-after neighborhoods.

Palazzo Chupi, five condominiums that the artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel built atop a former stable at 360 West 11th Street, has been the scene of considerable activity lately. Mr. Schnabel, who also has a studio in the building, has suffered through a year of embarrassing accounts of unsuccessful price cuts in the real estate blogs.

But in October, the triplex penthouse with Venetian-style arches, once listed for $32.5 million, was sold for $10.5 million to William J. B. Brady, a banker at Credit Suisse. Mr. Brady had spent $15.5 million in the fall of 2008 for a slightly smaller apartment in Palazzo Chupi.

The final condo being sold by Mr. Schnabel, a 3,960-square-foot duplex with three bedrooms and three balconies, is said to be in contract negotiations. The asking price was $12.95 million; Peter McCuen & Associates has the listing.

And now brokers say an apartment in the Chupi bought by the actor Richard Gere for $12 million has just been resold, for about $1 million less than he paid for it. Richard Orenstein, of Halstead Property’s SoHo office, who handled the sale, declined to comment.

Mr. Gere bought the apartment in fall 2007 as the luxury market was approaching a peak. Brokers say that it appears that Mr. Gere actually got a bargain, perhaps in exchange for adding celebrity pizazz to the palazzo.

The apartment has nearly 3,500 square feet of space, including four bedrooms, along with a small balcony and two larger terraces connected to the apartment by French doors.

But Mr. Gere, who between films has immersed himself in country life  with a house, a bed-and-breakfast, and now a dispute over some trees he chopped down on his property in Westchester  showed little interest in his Chupi pied-à-terre.

He put the apartment on the market in April 2008 for $17.995 million, and the following October, in the midst of the financial crisis, cut the price to $15 million.

The Gere sale was completed just as the appraiser Jonathan Miller reported that the largest backlog of unsold apartments in Manhattan is of the expensive downtown variety. Mr. Miller defines downtown as south of 34th Street from the Hudson River to Fifth Avenue, and south of 42nd Street from Fifth Avenue to the East River. He found that at the current sales rate, it would take 27 months to sell the existing inventory of condos listed at $5 million and up, and more than three years to sell the current stock of downtown co-ops in the same price range.

Another former stable, at 11 Spring Street, just off the Bowery, sold for $19.5 million, a significant sale  though far less than the $39.8 million once asked.

It was not clear whether the developers, who paid $12 million for the graffiti-splattered wreck in 2006, and spent millions to convert it to luxury housing, made a profit.

Brokers also report a deal taking shape on an unusual 8,000-square-foot duplex penthouse loft space at 140 Perry Street that was once listed for $19.9 million. They say the apartment, though not officially on the market, has been shown by Jan Hashey, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. She did not return several phone calls.

And in the West Village, a town house at 26 Bank Street owned by James D. Huniford, the interior designer, sold for $7.25 million, nearly $1 million below the asking price, property records say.

Leonard Steinberg, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that brokers showing larger apartments in hot neighborhoods like the Village were busy, with a shortage of properties and a “surplus of buyers.”

“I tell people if you have a good apartment in the Village, you don’t have to worry about a darn thing,” he said. “And the West Village is about as recession proof as any neighborhood I have ever seen.”
203 2009-12-06 David Gates, in his review of Nabokov’s unfinished “Original of Laura” (Nov. 15), mentions the protagonist’s “sentimentally remembered first love — this one is called Aurora Lee, in a deliberate echo of Humbert Humbert’s Annabel Leigh.” Nabokov’s allusions are many and various, but surely one main reference here is to Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “Aurora Leigh,” her book-length poem describing the growth of an artist.

204 2009-12-06 Jeanine F. Pirro, the three-term district attorney of Westchester County, left politics for television after being defeated by Andrew M. Cuomo in the 2006 race for state attorney general. Since 2008, she has been the star of “Judge Pirro,” a syndicated courtroom TV show that is produced in Chicago. Ms. Pirro is also a guest commentator on several programs, including “Fox and Friends” on Sunday mornings.

She and her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., a lawyer and lobbyist from whom she is separated, have a son in college and a daughter in law school. She spends weekends at her home in Rye, with her two French poodles and a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

SUNDAY TWO WAYS My wake-up time depends on whether I’m scheduled on “Fox and Friends.” If I’m on, the alarm clock gets me up at 5:45 and I’m out of the house by 6:30. I’m usually back home by 10, and since I’ve had my hair and makeup done, I’ll probably go to church and out to lunch or some other engagements. On the other Sundays, I wake up when I feel like it, and then I’ll run downstairs in my pajamas to make coffee, always some kind of flavored coffee, and go online to read the news.

EGGS FOR THE DOGS By 8, it’s time to give my 11-year-old white standard poodle, Dartina, her phenobarbital: I either put it in a boiled egg or wrap it up in some American cheese. She started having grand mal seizures a year ago. Tina’s a very elegant dog; I call her my supermodel. And then there’s Mickey, my black standard poodle. He’s 5, and he’s a juvenile delinquent. If I was still a D.A. and he was human, he’d be in jail! He begs for an egg, too, and he always gets one.

PILL FOR THE PIG Around 9:30 or 10, the dogs and I go outside to take some fruits and vegetables and pig pellets out to Wilbur. It’s quite a sight, the two dogs prancing along all excited, and me in my pajamas and probably boots, because it can get muddy back there. Wilbur is 19, so he gets an arthritis pill that I put in a cherry tomato. He weighs 250 pounds.

WORKOUT The dogs and I go downstairs to the gym, and I work out for an hour or so on the machines and with the free weights. I bought a couple of yoga tapes, but I’ve decided yoga’s too slow for me.
205 2009-12-06 The kidnappings took an economic toll, with oil production down dramatically. In August, the government started an amnesty program for militants willing to hand over their weapons, and oil production recovered. Two months later MEND declared a cease-fire, during which numerous top commanders surrendered and an unsteady calm settled over the delta. But recent violence in Port Harcourt has involved “former gunmen,” and MEND is already accusing the Nigerian Army of truce violations and threatening “appropriate retaliatory actions.”

Besides, though MEND first introduced the kidnapping business to Nigeria, kidnapping for ransom has since become a broader phenomenon. One reason is the economic incentive. Two months ago, I met Okiro at his Abuja home. The room was decorated with fake sunflowers and many portraits of Okiro. He had retired as police inspector general but remained proud of the measures he took while in office to stop kidnappers. They included tougher penalties and a law requiring registration for all SIM cards, which would make it easier to track the criminals’ phone calls. But as long as families and governments and companies continue to pay ransoms, Okiro told me, “there will be no end to it.”

The U.S. government concurs. Discussing the Somali pirates in April, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said companies that paid ransoms to the pirates were “part of the problem.” “Clearly, if they didn’t pay the ransoms, we’d be in a stronger position,” Gates added. (When a terrorist organization is involved, paying a ransom can actually put individuals and companies in violation of U.S. laws, including the Patriot Act.) As Erik Rye, an adviser for hostage affairs at the State Department, puts it, “If you’re out there feeding the bears, the bears are going to keep coming into the camp.”

But principles and policies are one thing. What about the victim? “Depending on who you talk to, we’re sort of the Antichrist: ‘You guys pay ransoms and that’s it,’ ” Jack Cloonan, the former president of Clayton Consultants, a leading kidnapping-and-ransom consultancy, told me. “That’s not necessarily the case. I don’t have any control over dysfunction in Somalia, which is just a hellhole.” To those who say the K.& R. industry only makes things worse, Cloonan replies, “Let’s wait for your kid to get kidnapped.”

OHN, THE SCOTTISH OILMAN, felt a tug on his shoulder and looked up to see a gunman, who said, “Come with me.” He and five other hostages — an American, a Briton, an Irishman, a Pole and a German — were pushed into minivans idling outside Goodfellas. They raced to the waterfront. At a wooden jetty, two speedboats waited. Everyone boarded, and then they disappeared into the delta’s creeks.

News about the kidnapping spread quickly around the world, and crisis-management teams formed in Lagos and Port Harcourt. At the meetings sat the hostages’ national and corporate representatives, along with kidnapping-and-ransom consultants. The K.& R. industry has four main components: K.& R. consultancies, insurance companies, corporations and governments. About three-quarters of Fortune 500 companies in the United States carry kidnapping insurance. John Chase, managing director of crisis response at AKE, a risk-mitigation company, has been in K.& R. for almost 20 years and says corporations are “taking out more and more policies.” American International Group (AIG) maintains 5,000 such policies. AIG, Lloyd’s of London and Chubb dominate the insurance side of the industry. All told, the global premium for kidnapping-and-ransom policies totals approximately $300 million.

What does a kidnapping-and-ransom policy entail? If an employee of Acme Widgets is kidnapped, Acme pays the ransom, and its insurance company pays out to Acme. But more important, once a kidnapping occurs, K.& R. consultants enter the picture. The consultant’s primary job is to negotiate the ransom. There are fewer than 30 such consultants with more than 10 years of experience around the world, according to Chase of AKE.

The contemporary kidnapping-and-ransom industry emerged in the late 1970s in response to rampant kidnappings in Colombia and throughout Latin America. Globally, for the next 25 years, most cases occurred in Latin America. But political and economic developments have begun redrawing the map of kidnapping hot spots. Chase still considers Colombia “the most mature market” for kidnapping because Colombian perpetrators have been at it the longest — although incidents decreased after President Alvaro Uribe began to take on the country’s guerrilla movements in 2002. There were 465 reported cases in Colombia last year (down from almost 3,000 in 2002). Mexico now has the most kidnappings, with an estimated 7,000 in 2008, though this number has stayed steady in recent years. In fact, Latin America’s share of total reported kidnappings fell to 42 percent in 2008 from 65 percent in 2004.

Gregory Bangs, the K.& R. manager at Chubb, doesn’t foresee the global market flattening out anytime soon. He said new markets were flourishing outside Latin America. Two emerging markets are in Africa and the Middle East; together their share of reported cases nearly quadrupled between 2004 and 2008. During that time, Somali pirates seized dozens of ships off the Horn of Africa. The ships were usually insured, and the pirates made off with increasingly large sums. In postwar Iraq, criminals relied on kidnapping to raise money, and Al Qaeda used kidnappings and beheadings to spread terror. The Taliban have also turned to kidnapping to raise money. And in Nigeria, what began with MEND quickly expanded. Foreigners are still kidnapped in Nigeria, but because many international companies have pulled their employees out of the country, the majority of cases now involve Nigerian victims. The range of victims seems to keep expanding. Kidnappers have grabbed children on the way to school. This summer, two politicians from central Nigeria were abducted; when their relatives couldn’t pay the ransom, the captors freed the two men to go and find the money — but only after they left their wives as collateral.

Perhaps the most shocking incident occurred in August, when Pete Edochie, a star of Nigeria’s film industry, was kidnapped. Edochie is a national icon. He is chairman of a national rebranding committee that is assigned the task of improving Nigeria’s image. Nigerians were shocked when they heard that kidnappers on a road in Anambra State had blocked Edochie’s S.U.V. and pulled him from the vehicle. Days later, after he was released for a reported 10 million naira, or $64,700, a newspaper headline read: “But We Are All Kidnapped!”

THE MEND MILITANTS built makeshift huts for John and his fellow hostages while singing Christian hymns and drinking kai-kai, a locally made palm liquor. The hostages ate takeout, which the kidnappers ordered from a restaurant called Mr. Biggs in downtown Port Harcourt — an hour’s boat ride away.

Helicopters passed over the camp occasionally, though no one ever seriously thought about trying to escape. They would be lost without G.P.S. devices, maps or compasses. In addition, the kidnappers assured them that negotiations were moving ahead.

If there’s any consolation to being abducted in Nigeria, it’s that kidnappers there seldom get violent. It’s purely business. “Someone’s going to pay them something; that they know,” Mark Courtney, a South African kidnapping-and-ransom consultant, recently told me. K.& R. consultants almost never get on the phone and haggle with kidnappers. Their expertise is devising the “target settlement figure,” taking into account numerous factors. Is the victim carrying anything that identifies him as working for a specific company? Are the kidnappers experienced? What was the amount of the previous ransoms paid in that city or state? “You go by what you know to be the going rate in that particular region,” Chase, of AKE, said.

Negotiating a ransom is more art than science. “If you pay the ransom too quickly, the bad guys think you have access to more money,” Courtney said. If you pay too late, the victim could get sick and die. “You have to turn your client into a commodity,” he said.

A breakthrough came on the 10th day of John’s captivity. That morning, one of the kidnappers handed him a camouflage shirt, pants, a pair of gloves and a balaclava, with instructions to suit up. John put on the clothes, which made him indistinguishable from his captors. They all boarded a speedboat and motored through the creeks. After about 20 minutes, the boat beached on a patch of sand, where three men were waiting. One of them held a cellphone. “We’re going to make a phone call, and a guy is going to speak with you and give you a proof-of-life question,” said the one holding the phone, whose voice brimmed with the measured confidence of someone about to close a deal. “They want to know that you’re alive.”

Chase said the proof-of-life question — and the way it is handled — often defines the case. “It’s always comforting when they talk about the P.O.L.,” Chase said. “They’ve done this before. They know the form. They know how the game is played.”

John took off his balaclava and held the phone to his ear. The man on the other end said he was with the State Security Services, or S.S.S. He asked John two proof-of-life questions: where did he live in 1986 and what was the company he worked for. John answered them both correctly.

“All right, I know it’s you,” the officer said. He assured John that the S.S.S. was working hard for the release of the six men, and then he hung up. John pulled on the balaclava, climbed into the boat and returned to camp.

That night, the kidnappers got ready. Everyone eventually loaded into three speedboats and raced toward a meeting point. After some time, John could make out the yellow glow of Port Harcourt up ahead. The boats eased against a crumbling concrete berth, and the hostages were hoisted out. They ran to a waiting Land Cruiser and then took off down a potholed, unlighted road, en route to the governor’s mansion.

A battery of TV cameras was waiting for the six hostages, who were jubilant, shocked and relieved. Peter Odili, the debonair governor of Rivers State, of which Port Harcourt is the capital, hugged the men and smiled. During Odili’s two terms as governor, from 1999 to 2007, journalists and human rights organizations criticized him for paying thugs to rig elections and using public funds to pay ransoms. “Kidnapping business is a source of fraud for the governors,” Festus Keyamo, an Abuja-based human rights lawyer, said. (Among his clients is the militant leader Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.) One kidnapper in Port Harcourt told me that every ransom he received had been paid by the state government.

ONE MORNING IN late August, I stood outside a villa in Port Harcourt with a kidnapper named Adiele Nwaeze. Overhead, clouds moaned with thunder, and rain began to fall. Nwaeze, who is 33 and a father of four, stepped under a ledge to stay dry. He wore a navy blue suit and black leather shoes shaped like gondolas.

Nwaeze got into the business 10 years ago. His father, who sold firewood for a living, died when Nwaeze was young. Nwaeze took a job as an auto mechanic to support his mother and three siblings. One day, he went to the governor’s residence and offered to work on the official vehicles. The gatekeepers told Nwaeze that the cars were under warranty, so he left.

Not long after that, Nwaeze says, emissaries of Peter Odili, who was a gubernatorial candidate at the time, showed up at Nwaeze’s garage. He says they offered him 200,000 naira, or about $1,700, to help them rig a coming election. They threw in a machine gun and 10 AK-47’s to sweeten the deal, according to Nwaeze. (Odili told me he had never heard of Nwaeze.) Nwaeze says he accepted and spent Election Day stealing ballot boxes. Odili won with ease. But after the polls closed, there was no more work. Nwaeze formed a gang. “I had no choice,” he said. “I had a gun and I had to make a living. We started bunkering oil pipelines” — or stealing oil — “then kidnapping expatriates — a lot of white men.”

In July 2008, Nwaeze’s gang of about 10 men abducted two Germans from a construction site near Port Harcourt. The kidnappers outgunned more than a dozen Nigerian soldiers who were assigned to protect the expatriate staff. “We kill the soldier and take the man,” he said. “We are not afraid of the soldiers.” Nwaeze took the German hostages into the creeks and held them for more than a month while their employer, a German-Nigerian construction company called Julius Berger, worked for their release. (Meanwhile, Julius Berger terminated its outstanding contracts in the Niger Delta.) Nwaeze first demanded 300 million naira, or $2.6 million. He claims he settled for 50 million naira, about $430,000.

What did Nwaeze do with his cut? First, he hired an architect to design a home in Port Harcourt. Then he bought cars: a Honda City and a Nissan Pathfinder for himself, and a Honda sedan for the commissioner of police in Rivers State, according to Innocent Nzenwa, Nwaeze’s lawyer. Nzenwa described his client’s relationship with the commissioner as “a romance.” “They knew what each other were doing, but they were in payback,” he said. “You can’t commit such crimes without notifying the policemen. They usually inform the police on the day of the strike so the police stay off the road and allow them. The police get their own percentage.”

Bala Hassan, the aforementioned police commissioner, told me Nwaeze was “the most-wanted kidnapper in Port Harcourt” as well as “very vicious.” He denied any ties with the man, saying: “I am a lawyer; I don’t put my hand in that. That’s a factual impossibility.”

Back in April, not long after Nwaeze’s new home was finished, the “romance” with the commissioner, if there was one, soured. Nwaeze’s home was unexpectedly bulldozed. Nzenwa, the lawyer for Nwaeze, blamed a “falling out” between the two men that resulted in wanted posters for Nwaeze all over Port Harcourt.

The villa in which Nwaeze and I met in August doubled as a military safe house. Ten days earlier, he surrendered under the aegis of the amnesty program. Still, Nwaeze was skeptical. He expected more incentives from the government. “Let them give me back my house,” he said. “Then give me money to start my life so I can forget about how I have come. On my own, I used to make 20 million naira” — $130,000 — “in less than a week. Now that I have dropped the gun, they should give me more than that, so that I can remove my eyes from these things.”

Nzenwa, the lawyer, suspected his client would be kidnapping again before long. “When the government doesn’t meet his requests, he will have to go and rearm himself,” he said.

HE KIDNAPPING-AND-ransom-insurance industry thrives in a morally ambiguous space. But what is the alternative? “Fire insurance has been known to stimulate arson, and life-insurance policies have led to quite a few homicides, too,” said Thomas Hargrove, an American held for 11 months in 1994-5 by Colombian guerrillas and whose story inspired the making of the 2000 film “Proof of Life.” “Are you going to quit taking out life insurance and fire insurance?”

Even kidnappers seem cognizant of their ethical compromises. Ransoms may perpetuate the consulting business, but kidnappers are the ones who decide whether abducting people remains a viable trade. In late August, I reached Mujahid Dokubo-Asari on the phone shortly after he fled Nigeria for Benin. He was among the first militants to take up arms in the Niger Delta. His arrest in 2005, and subsequent demands by other militants for his release, fostered the creation of MEND.

Dokubo-Asari began our conversation by calling kidnapping “immoral,” “evil” and “counterrevolutionary.” Criminals were responsible for most of the kidnappings, he said. They were the ones accepting amnesty, he added, not the true militants or, in his words, “freedom fighters.” “Even if they drop their guns and come out today — what next?” he asked. “The money they were making, the undeserved money from kidnapping, they are not going to get it any longer. If they can’t get it any longer, they will go back to crime.”

Dokubo-Asari’s objections to kidnapping softened, however, the more we spoke. When I asked him about those still fighting in the creeks, he referred to the militants’ “near agreement” that “abduction of government officials and those businessmen who have benefited from government contracts, that is not immoral.” And foreign oil workers? “We are discussing all that,” he said. “The conversation is going on now.”

On my last night in Port Harcourt, I had dinner at Cheers Bar with a kidnapper who asked to be identified by his nom de guerre, “De Don.” De Don, who is 28, wore a peach-and-white long-sleeve shirt, with the top buttons undone. A gold cross hung around his neck. “It is just for beauty,” he said. “It doesn’t mean I’m a Christian.” Three years ago, De Don graduated from college with a degree in political science. He considered “The Prince” his favorite book. While at school, he joined a campus gang known as the Greenlanders. When he couldn’t find work after graduation, he tapped into the Greenlanders’ alumni network and asked for help. Soon he was living in the creeks with fellow Greenlanders, part of a kidnapping syndicate.

De Don admitted kidnapping three people. One of them was the 7-year-old son of a politician. He ran an amateur operation; the ransoms he received were paltry compared with those commanded by someone like Nwaeze. “I have never kidnapped whites,” he told me. “That’s where the real money comes.” Still, he made enough in the past year to rent an apartment in Port Harcourt, buy a 2002 Mercedes sedan, support his family and open a beauty salon for one of his girlfriends. He hoped one day to buy a cinema where he could show soccer matches.

A World Cup qualifying match was playing on a TV across the room. A handful of boisterous middle-aged white men clustered around the bar.

I asked De Don if he might contemplate coming back to Cheers Bar on a busy night to kidnap a few expats. “No way,” he said. “When I am coming into a bar, I’m coming to spend money and flex, not to kidnap anyone.” Plus, he was waiting to see how the amnesty played out.

“After knowing what it takes to become a political scientist, then going into such things as kidnapping, it’s not really ideal,” he went on to say. The bar cheered when one team scored a goal. De Don turned to the TV and watched the replay. Then he looked back at me and shook his head. “I am not happy doing this,” he said. “But I need it to survive.”
206 2009-12-06 I don’t think anything would rattle the mother of a preteen boy quite like the words my 12-year-old uttered this spring: “Mom, we need to talk,” he said. “It’s something serious.” The reversal of roles; the need for him to address me. The “serious” part. These were enough, in the very short time it took to follow him to his bedroom, to completely freak me out. He’d just returned to Michigan after visiting his father in New York. Had something catastrophic happened while he was there? Had he done drugs or had sex? I hoped he’d just left his iPod on the plane.

In his room, I stepped around Xbox games, dirty socks, “Star Wars” Lego pieces and a lot of empty mugs (so that’s where they all were) to get to his bed. We both sat down. I waited. Except he didn’t say anything. He hemmed and hawed. The sense of role reversal continued: I felt as if I were the kid, and not for the first time.

I was 18 when I became pregnant with my son, after all. When I chose to keep him, people warned that my failure with house plants and my ambivalence toward pets would make me a miserable mother — and that my decision would keep me from “accomplishing my dreams.” But it turned out not to be so. Unlike a house plant, my son eventually told me when he was hungry, and unlike a pet, he eventually could use the toilet, and within a few years he became a great conversationalist and brunch partner. As a single mother, I didn’t have anyone to consult with over matters of discipline, schooling, band instruments or firm bedtimes. And there were days when I felt more like his older sister or a baby sitter than his mother: I raided our fridge late at night and waited for his real parents to show up. But except for moments like this, that had mainly passed.

“The thing is . . . ,” my son finally said.

And that’s when it struck me. I could hear it in his voice. “You want to go live with your dad?”

“Yeah! How did you know?”

I’d recently married my boyfriend of two years, a wonderful man and an excellent stepdad. But during this same time my son’s father, an absentee for most of the early years, had become more and more of a positive and fun presence in his life. My son visited his father and his stepmom every school break. And often when my son came home from these visits, he was a little depressed for a while, and talked about how he wished he could see his dad more often.

“No, Mom!” he said. “I don’t think it’ll pass. Because. . . . ”
207 2009-12-06 Have you ever heard a lion roar? I did one evening at the San Diego Zoo, and I recommend the experience. From 20 paces, the bone-rattling sonic blast, both thrilling and terrifying, leaves no doubt as to who’s still king of the jungle — or ought to be. Neither do the photographs of a lion in Andrew Zuckerman’s first book for children, “Creature ABC.”

Zuckerman is an accomplished photographer and filmmaker whose previous books include “Wisdom,” a coffee-table compilation of portraits of celebrity graybeards and their reflections on life, and “Creature,” an equally sumptuous album of animal studio shots. That volume is the photographic mother lode from which all but a handful of the images in “Creature ABC” have been drawn.

Animal alphabets have long been a mainstay of children’s books, a resilient subgenre with a basic 26-part structure that provides ample room for all manner of graphic inventiveness. Zuckerman’s signature white backdrops and minimal captions rendered in crisp, clean Helvetica Bold suit the format well, leaving the way clear for readers to lock eyes, largely undistracted, not only with a lion but also with a mandrill, hippopotamus, black bear, kangaroo and screech owl, to name a few.

Not every animal is equally ready for its close-up. Zuckerman’s porcupine displays the rodent equivalent of a steely expression and, crowned with an impressive thicket of spiky quills, the resolute look of a warrior on red alert. But the oryx — perhaps only puzzled to be representing the letter “X” — stares blankly at the camera, and the zebra, a black-and-white vision in a black-and-white world, looks less like a wild equine than the centerpiece of a high-concept design or fashion statement.

More often than not, however, Zuckerman connects with his subjects to an uncanny degree. In one of the book’s more effective spreads, a king-size “L” appears opposite the headshot of the proud male lion, with his laserlike gaze. The big cat, with his “been there, done that” air of sublime assurance, might almost pass for one of the photographer’s graybeards — Zbigniew Brzezinski with a poofy mane. But then on the next page Zuckerman gives us another shot of the same lion baring his huge teeth in midroar, as, vicariously, we beat a hasty retreat to safer ground.

Photo portraits like these can make the animal world seem less remote to children. In “Life-Size Zoo,” Teruyuki Komiya, a naturalist and the director of Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo, pursues a playful and developmentally savvy variation on the same idea. The book captures — with photographs by Toyofumi Fukuda — the life-size portraits of 20 animals, or (for the larger ones) at least close-ups of a horn, an eye or a nose.
208 2009-12-06 From 1914 until 1930, C. G. Jung recorded, revised, rewrote, recopied and painstakingly illustrated what he considered “the numinous beginning” from which all the rest of his work derived. “The Red Book,” or as Jung called it, “Liber Novus,” consisted of some 200 parchment pages of meticulous calligraphy and visionary paintings collected into a huge folio bound in red leather. While its content, either whole or in part, was made available to a handful of colleagues and patients, its publication was postponed until now, nearly 50 years after his death, because Jung feared the book’s potential impact on his reputation. After all, anyone who read it might conclude what Jung himself first suspected: that the great doctor had lost his mind.

Jung began what would become “The Red Book” shortly after he had fallen out with Freud, each unable to accept the other’s understanding of the unconscious. Though Jung agreed with Freud’s basic theory that the unconscious mind existed beyond the reach of consciousness and yet influenced human behavior, he believed Freud’s conception of it as a dark vault of repressed urges and denied emotions was incomplete and unnecessarily negative — too focused on neurosis. The 1912 publication of Jung’s “Psychology of the Unconscious,” which had grown out of his psychoanalysis of the heroes and heroines of “mythology, folklore and religion” made the two doctors’ differences of opinion public, and the Zurich Psychoanalytical Society, with which Jung was actively involved, broke away from Freud’s International Psychoanalytic Association.

Undoubtedly, Jung’s liberation from his mentor was as unnerving as it was exciting, and in the fall of 1913 he had a series of waking visions that disturbed him both for their overwhelming, bloody devastation, and because he could not interpret them. Having worked with schizophrenic patients in thrall to their own tormenting hallucinations, he concluded he was “menaced with a psychosis” and, ever the clinician, decided to take notes on his madness. But the advent of World War I changed his understanding of the visions. In the face of actual widespread carnage, he now received them as prophecy, evidence, the editor and translator Sonu Shamdasani writes, of “deep subliminal connections between individual fantasies and world events.”

Jung’s study of archetypes in myths had convinced him that the creation of symbols was a characteristic of mankind; it wasn’t necessarily pathological — quite the opposite. The “union of rational and irrational truth,” symbols were the essential and necessary product of the unconscious, its “most important function.” Using a language of archetypes and symbols to speak to the conscious mind, the unconscious offered a means toward self-awareness far more profound than the groping of consciousness alone. Armed with this conviction, Jung embarked on a journey into his own unexplored depths.

Practicing “active imagination,” Jung conjured characters with whom he interacted and conversed. Dreams, he felt, were “inferior expressions of unconscious content” because there was less tension in sleep. “The Red Book” “faithfully transcribed” visions Jung recorded privately in his “Black Books,” adding commentary and painting what he had seen in his waking dreams to encourage readers to “understand the psychological nature of symbolism” and challenge them “to a new way of looking at their souls.” The whole is structured after Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” a work of great influence on Jung. But while Nietzsche had announced the death of God, “The Red Book” described “the rebirth of God in the soul,” drawing from many and varied sources, including the Bible, the Apocrypha, Gnostic texts, Greek myths, the Upanishads, the ancient Egyptian “Am-Tuat,” Wagner’s “Ring,” Goethe’s “Faust” and Dante’s “Divine Comedy.” And, as Shamdasani points out, although the writers on whom Jung drew “could utilize an established cosmology, ‘Liber Novus’ is an attempt to shape an individual cosmology.” Jung continued to practice while working on “The Red Book” and encouraged his analysands to summon and record their own visions, as he had done. The book a patient created would be, he said, “your church — your cathedral — the silent places of your spirit where you will find renewal.”
209 2009-12-06 Done well, memoirs about love and food go together like steak and martinis. Meals are a perfect application for the “show, don’t tell” directive, from proposal soufflé to break-up pastina. These foodoirs have become a successful subset, one part chick lit mixed with one part chicken lit.

Julie Powell water-skied to notoriety on Julia Child’s apron, following every recipe in “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” for a blog she called The Julie/Julia Project. The blog became a memoir, “Julie & Julia,” which in turn became a movie, the momentum of which whipped both Child’s and Powell’s books to the heights of the best-seller lists.

The publishers of Powell’s second memoir wisely waited until December to release it, lest they freak out book-buying admirers of “Julie & Julia’s” plucky co-star. “Cleaving” promises marriage, meat and obsession, but the object of said obsession is not a standing rib roast. It’s a man she calls D, who likes trussing our anti-heroine and covering her in bruises before sending her home to cook for her husband. The woman who came across as simply whiny and self-­absorbed in the film reveals a dark, damaged persona. Nora Ephron won’t be touching this one with a 20-foot baguette.

Powell and her “long-suffering husband,” Eric, are really suffering now. Unsatisfied by her new career, the author (“just call me Julie ‘Steamroller’ Powell”) — whose motto is “Want. Take. Have.” — has a two-year affair with D. His forceful wanting/taking/having of her instills the confidence that being played by Amy Adams in the movie apparently did not. “It was when he smilingly roughed me up that I finally felt fierce, strong — emancipated,” she writes of his first smack.

But wait. It gets more abject. Eric knows. So he has an affair, too. Powell relishes punishing him with kindness. “Have fun,” she texts him. “Come home whenever you like.” After D ends things (“You know it’s over when he’d rather show you ‘Team America’ than his penis,” he had warned her months before flipping open his laptop in bed on the fateful day), she resorts to cyberstalking. Powell’s not kidding about the “obsession” part: she pathetically texts and e-mails into the ether for almost a year, then fleshes her longing into a book that doesn’t spare the reader a single full-frontal flashback.

Eventually, she seeks a numbing distraction, something to reroute her self-destructive, addictive tendencies. How about butchering? Butchers are hot, Powell reasons, ahead of the current craze for men with cleavers. They are “more certain of meat than I’ve ever been about anything.” She apprentices at Fleisher’s, a cult butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y. (where I shop), and learns how to take things apart in the hope of putting her life back together. Or not. Rather than assuage her pathologically adoring husband, she wills her BlackBerry to buzz after sending D texts like: “Just had the worst sex in the world with a total stranger to try to get you out of my head. It didn’t work.”
210 2009-12-06 Is it real? The redesigned midsize crossover goes on sale next month.

What they said: “With a streamlined and attractive look, the new Sorento represents a modern C.U.V. that is just the right size for today’s consumer,” according to the press kit.

What they didn’t say: “Now we’re playing the same crossover game as every other carmaker.”

What makes it tick? Built at a new plant in Georgia atop an all-new unibody structure and available with either a 175-horsepower 2.4-liter 4 or a 276-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6, the Sorento puts Kia in the deep end of the crossover mainstream. About the size of a Chevrolet Equinox and likewise offering choices of engines, transmissions and drivetrains (either front- or all-wheel drive), the Sorento is the first built-in-America Kia. The company, which has gained market share for 14 straight months, is betting that the redesigned Sorento will help to sustain that impressive momentum.

How much, how soon? Kia promises a starting price under $20,000. Even fully equipped with the V-6, all-wheel drive and a panorama roof, the sticker price is expected to be less than $30,000.

How’s it look? Handsome, substantial, nicely equipped and roomy enough for five  though cruel for anyone sentenced to the third-row seat  the Sorento makes instant intuitive sense. And given its keen price, it is likely to attract hordes of buyers.
211 2009-12-06 A quick bit of background: Dan and I married on July 1, 2000, in Olema, Calif. I wore a white dress. Dan was 32; I was 30. We vowed to have and to hold, to love and to cherish in sickness and in health, etc. We were optimistic, cocky and vague about the concept of marriage. We never discussed, or considered discussing, why we were getting married or what a good marriage would mean. It all seemed obvious. I loved Dan; I loved how I felt with him. Ergo I wanted to be his wife.

During the first nine years of our marriage — that is, until we tried to improve it — Dan and I thought little about our expectations and even less about our parents’ marriages, both of which have lasted more than 40 years. Our families had set very different examples of how a marriage could be good. Dan was raised in Berkeley, Calif., by VW-bus-driving lefties who were so utterly committed to their own romance that Dan sometimes felt left out. Each meal and each sunset was the most exquisite. When girls refused to talk to Dan in high school, his mother told him they were just too intimidated by his incredible good looks. My parents’ marriage, meanwhile, resembled nothing so much as a small business. They raised their three children in Wellesley, Mass., where civic life was so tidy that kids held bake sales at the town dump. All conjugal affection took place out of sight. “You’re a good Do Bee” was considered high praise.

After our wedding, with some money from a boom-time book advance, we bought a run-down house in San Francisco. We assumed that our big problems would be money (or lack thereof; we’re both freelance writers) and religion (I’m Jewish; Dan’s Christian). Neither turned out to be true. We built — or more accurately fell — into a 21st-century companionate marriage. But Dan and I were not just economic partners, lovers, (soon enough) co-parents and best friends. We were also each other’s co-workers, editors and primary readers. Both working from home, our lives resembled a D-list version of Joan Didion’s and John Gregory Dunne’s, whose days, according to Didion, “were filled with the sound of each other’s voices” — except with what I can only assume is a much more egregious lack of boundaries. We lost steam 95 percent of the way through our D.I.Y. home remodeling and, as a result, have no master-bathroom door.

But how to start? What would a better marriage look like? More happiness? Intimacy? Stability? Laughter? Fewer fights? A smoother partnership? More intriguing conversation? More excellent sex? Our goal and how to reach it were strangely unclear. We all know what marriage is: a legal commitment between two people. But a good marriage? For guidance I turned to the standard assessments. The Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test instructs spouses, among other things, to rank themselves along the “always agree” to “always disagree” continuum on matters ranging from recreation to in-laws. This struck me as scattershot and beside the point. For all the endless talk about marriage — who should have the right to be in one, whether the declining numbers of married-parent households are hurting America’s children — we don’t know much about what makes a marriage satisfying or how to keep one that way. John Gottman, in his Love Lab in Seattle, claims that he can analyze a conversation between spouses and predict with 94 percent accuracy whether that couple will divorce over the course of six years. But many academics say that Gottman’s powers of prophecy are overblown, that he can’t truly predict if a couple will split. Those not selling books, workshops or counseling admit to knowing surprisingly little. Harry Reis, a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, likens our current understanding of “relationship science” to the Buddhist parable of the blind men and the elephant. One blind man “feels the tusk, inferring that elephants are hard and sharp-edged, like a blade. Another touches the soft, flexible ear, concluding that elephants are supple, resembling felt. A third imagines massive strength from grasping the pillar-like structure of the leg. The perspective of each person touching the elephant is valid, as far as it goes. . . .” But no one understands the whole beast.

Dan and I decided to dive in, trusting that the terms of our better marriage and the yardstick by which to measure those terms would emerge along the way. It seemed safest to start in private, so we began our putative improving with Harville Hendrix’s Oprah-sanctioned self-help best seller, “Getting the Love You Want.” I let Dan pick the first exercise. It seemed only sporting. I assumed he would choose “positive flooding,” which includes making a list of all the qualities you wish your partner would praise you for but never does and then sitting in a chair as your spouse walks circles around you, reading that list in an increasingly loud and emphatic voice. (I was terrible at giving Dan compliments, even though he craved them; I sided with the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, who writes that in marriage “the long applause becomes baffling.”) But instead Dan chose “reromanticizing.” In hindsight, no surprise — Dan’s parents were dreamy and passionate.

Step 1: Complete this sentence in as many ways as possible: “I feel loved and cared about when you. . . .”

Dan quickly jotted down “submit to kissing, clean the kitchen, tell me I look studly.”

“Let’s try for 10,” I said.

“Ten!” Dan said, teasing but serious, one of our most common modes of conversation. “You can think of 10?”

In “Intimate Terrorism: The Crisis of Love in an Age of Disillusion,” the psychologist Michael Vincent Miller describes marriage as mocking our “fondest dreams,” because the institution is not the wellspring of love we imagine it to be. Instead it’s an environment of scarcity, it’s “a barbaric competition over whose needs get met”; it’s “two people trying to make a go of it on emotional and psychological supplies that are only sufficient for one.” And true enough, with “Getting the Love You Want” splayed on our bed, I began seeing Dan as my adversary, the person against whom I was negotiating the terms of our lives. I remembered well, but not fondly, this feeling from early in our marriage, when nearly everything was still up for grabs: Where would we live? How much money was enough? What algorithm would determine who would watch the baby and who would go to the gym? Recently those questions had settled, and our marriage felt better for it. But now the competitive mind-set came roaring back, as I reasoned, unconsciously anyway, that any changes we made would either be toward Dan’s vision of marriage and away from mine or the other way around. Admitting too much satisfaction seemed tantamount to ceding the upper hand. So I held my ground. I, too, failed to think of 10 things Dan did that made me feel loved. “O.K.,” I said, “let’s quit after 8.”

Step 2: Recall the romantic stage of your relationship. Complete this sentence: “I used to feel loved and cared about when you. . . .”

Dan made one of those circles with a line through it on his paper, symbolizing, he ribbed, “the null set.” Then he grabbed my list. “ ‘Looked giddy to come through the door and see me,’ ” Dan read. “Are you kidding me? You don’t even see me when you come through the door. It’s like you’re blind and deaf to everyone but the kids.”

I thought I had avoided becoming one of those mothers who transferred all of her romantic energy from her husband to her children. Apparently I failed. But Dan, in my view, hadn’t mastered the spouse-parent balance, either, only his problem was the opposite: at times he ignored the kids. While reromanticizing, I asked him, testily, “Do you really think a 6-2, 200-pound man who works at home with his wife needs to compete with his small children for their mother’s attention before those children leave for school?” Great. Now we were having a fight. Dan retreated to the bathroom to check his progress on his six-pack. My doubts set in. This was the fear, right? You set out to improve your marriage; it implodes. What if my good marriage was not floating atop a sea of goodness, adrift but fairly stable when pushed? What if my good marriage was teetering on a precipice and any change would mean a toppling, a crashing down?

Much of the commentary on modern marriage is frankly terrifying. Miller describes “the marital ghetto” — the marital ghetto? — as “the human equivalent of a balanced aquarium, where the fish and the plants manage to live indefinitely off each other’s waste products.” Perhaps we’d been striving in raising children and not in marriage because child-rearing is a dictatorship and marriage is a democracy. The children do not get to vote on the direction of the relationship, on which sleep-training or discipline philosophy they like best. But with a spouse, particularly a contemporary American spouse, equality is foundational, assumed. A friend had recently told me that he thought I was the boss in my marriage. Did I really want to negotiate my marriage anew and risk losing that power? From the bathroom, Dan asked, “Do you really think this project is a good idea?”

I realized that my favorite books about marriage — Calvin Trillin’s “About Alice” and Joan Didion’s “Year of Magical Thinking” — included one spouse who was dead.

Still, one Saturday last spring, we drove across the Golden Gate Bridge to Mill Valley to attend a marriage-education class. In academic circles, marriage education is known as a “prevention” program, an implicit admission that by the time most couples get to the subsequent program — therapy — it’s too late. The classes, sadly, have all the intellectual glamour of driver’s ed. But they’re based on the optimistic idea that you can learn to be better at marriage. As Bernard G. Guerney Jr., a clinical psychologist, family therapist and the godfather of the marriage-education movement, wrote in his 1977 book “Relationship Enhancement,” unless an unhappily married spouse “is suffering a biochemical deficiency or imbalance, he is no more sick than someone who wants to play tennis and does not know how, and the professional is no more providing ‘therapy’ or ‘curing’ his or her client than a tennis coach is ‘curing’ his clients.”

We enrolled in a 16-hour, two-Saturday course called “Mastering the Mysteries of Love.” The classes teach students how to have “skilled conversations” or rather, I should say, how to stop having the let’s-see-who-rhetorically-wins skirmishes that were standard in our house. A skilled conversation is an exercise in forced empathy. One person starts by describing his or her feelings. The other person then validates those feelings, repeating them back nearly verbatim.

Midmorning, with the gongs of the supposedly soothing spa music crashing in the background, Dan and I retreated to a couch with a template for having a skilled conversation about a “small disagreement.” Among our most longstanding fights was how much energy and money should go into Dan’s cooking. Shortly after our first child, Hannah, was born, Dan and I started having the same conversation every night: do you want to cook dinner or look after the kid? He always picked cook, I always picked kid, and now, seven years later, Dan was an excellent, compulsive and profligate chef. We spent far more money on food than we did on our mortgage. Sure, we ate well. Very well. Our refrigerator held, depending on the season: homemade gravlax, Strauss organic milk, salt-packed anchovies, little gem lettuces, preserved Meyer lemons, imported Parmesan, mozzarella and goat cheese, baby leeks, green garlic, Blue Bottle coffee ($18 a pound), supergroovy pastured eggs. On a ho-hum weeknight Dan might make me pan-roasted salmon with truffled polenta in a Madeira shallot reduction. But this was only a partial joy. Dan’s cooking enabled him to hide out in plain sight; he was home but busy — What? I’m cooking dinner! — for hours every evening. During this time I was left to attend to our increasingly hungry, tired and frantic children and to worry about money. That was our division of labor: Dan cooked, I tended finances. Because of the cooking, in part, we saved little for retirement and nothing for our children’s college educations.

I garnered no sympathy from our friends. Still, Dan’s cooking and the chaos it created drove me mad, a position I expressed by leaving whole pigeons untouched on my plate. Dan, meanwhile, entrenched and retaliated, slipping crispy fried pigs’ ears into my salads and making preposterously indulgent weekday breakfasts, the girls upending flour bowls and competing for Dad’s attention as he made them crepes with grapes and Champagne sauce at 6:45 a.m. I knew Dan’s cooking and his obsessions in general were mechanisms to bind his anxiety, attempts to bring order to an unruly mind. Without an outlet, Dan tended toward depression, and his depression vented as anger. In his early 20s, he learned the trick of focusing and applying himself, at nearly all times, so his energy would not, as he put it, “turn bad.” I respected this, even appreciated it, in theory. But I struggled with the specifics. Dan cooked, because he needed to cook, blitzing through one cookbook after another, putting little check marks next to every recipe. He was not cooking for me, not for the girls. Yet now in our marriage class, following the skilled-conversation template, the emotional distance between us on this issue seemed to collapse. I said, then Dan mirrored back to me, “The chaos is really upsetting, and you’d like to find a way to maintain more peace and calm in our home.” Then Dan said, and I mirrored to him: “Food is a truly important part of family. For you it’s health and pleasure bound together, and it lets you express and pursue the life you want to live three times a day.”

That afternoon, as we talked in this stilted, earnest style — covering such esteemed topics as backrubs and stray socks, the utter banalities of married life — I felt a trapdoor crack open in our marriage. According to a widely accepted model, intimacy begins when one person expresses revealing feelings, builds when the listener responds with support and empathy and is achieved when the discloser hears these things and feels understood, validated and cared for. This is not news. It’s not even advice. Offering a married couple this model is like informing an obese person that he should eat less and move more. But in the days and nights that followed that course, our intimacy grew. We had never considered our verbal jousting to be protecting uncomfortable feelings. Clearly it was. Back home, that first irony-free evening, I found myself telling Dan a raft of antiheroic stories about my childhood, stories I’d never told him, I realized, because I felt insecure. They were tales about suburban bat mitzvahs and the pedal pushers I wore to them, anecdotes from a conventional East Coast world our marriage eschewed. Without the ironclad guarantee of empathy, I had felt that they might go over poorly, especially alongside Dan’s epics of a glorious youth spent playing Frisbee in Berkeley’s Tilden Park.

For the next few weeks, even our sex was more intimate, more open and trusting. Then I found myself recoiling. As if I were obeying Newton’s third law of motion, I had an innate equal and opposite reaction to our newfound intimacy, to living our lives, as the saccharine marriage-improvement phrase goes, as we instead of as me. I loved the idea of digging out of my emotional bunker and going over to Dan’s to live with him. And I liked being there, for a while. But Dan has a bigger, flashier personality than I do. I feared, in our intimacy, I might be subsumed. As many women had, I read in fascinated horror, a few years back, about a Buddhist couple who took vows never to be parted by more than 15 feet. They inhaled and exhaled in unison while doing yoga, walked each other to writing desks when inspiration struck in the middle of the night. “It is very intimate,” the male partner explained. That vision of intimacy as a chain-link leash filled me with dread. Yes, I loved the emotional security of knowing that if I said, “I’m upset,” Dan would repeat back, “You’re upset.” But while such command empathy was comforting to a point, it felt unsustainable, even cloying.

Some days, following intimate nights, I’d walk up to our kitchen from our bedroom below and want to pretend it didn’t happen. Dan would caress the small of my back. I’d squirm away. I knew older couples who slept in separate bedrooms, an arrangement that unsettled me as a newlywed but now struck me as a sound approach to running the chute between intimacy and autonomy over the course of 50 years. Yet Dan and I weren’t going to stop sharing a room — for one thing, we lacked the space. So while working to improve our marriage, I found myself pushing my husband away. I had started our project assuming the more closeness, the better. But that wasn’t turning out to be true, at least for me.

A few weeks later we drove through San Francisco to the tony Laurel Village neighborhood from our house in Bernal Heights for some psychoanalytic couple’s therapy. En route we discussed not shaking the bushes of our union too hard. Dan had just flown home from London where he was working on a story about Fergus Henderson, a chef who defines half a pig’s head as “a perfect romantic supper for two.” Henderson has Parkinson’s but told Dan he stopped reading about the disease, because in his experience “the more I know, the more symptoms I have.” Following suit, we thought it best to stick to dissecting the good parts of our marriage and how to improve them, as marriage can bring out people’s worst. Even those who are tolerant, wise and giving are often short and rude to their mates. I had always winced at the opening of Chekov’s “Lady With the Dog.” The narrator describes the protagonist’s wife as “a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified.” Then he gives us her husband’s view: “he secretly considered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her and did not like to be at home.” How much did we really want to share?

A word here about psychoanalytic reasoning: I’ve never been a big fan. I’ve long favored the fake-it-till-you-make-it approach to life. Why turn over the rocks of your history just to see what’s underneath? In marriage therapy, this fear makes particular sense, because the therapy carries not only the threat of learning things about yourself that you might prefer not to know but also the hazard of saying things to your spouse that are better left unsaid, as well as hearing things from your spouse that you might prefer not to hear. Some in the field are outwardly critical of most marriage therapy; among them is William J. Doherty, a psychologist and the director of the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at the University of Minnesota, who writes, “If you talk to a therapist in the United States about problems in your marriage, I believe that you stand a good risk of harming your marriage.” The science behind marital counseling is also less precise than you might imagine. In clinical trials, among the most effective protocols is Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy, an unabashed mash-up of two schools of thought. Couples work on “change-oriented strategies,” trying to find ways to remedy each other’s complaints. They also do “acceptance work,” trying to learn to love the relationships as is.

Holly Gordon, our reed-thin psychoanalyst, did not think much of our plan. “To get the most out of your time here we need to talk about some dissatisfaction or problem, something you’re trying to improve,” she instructed, closing a double set of soundproof doors. So we settled into airing some well-rehearsed gripes — the time Dan came to the hospital to visit me and four-pound, premature Hannah, and all he could talk about was the San Francisco building code. (He’d torn the front stairs off our house and kept rebuilding them and ripping them off again, fearing they were imperfect.) The time Dan proposed a trade: he would clean up more, he swore he would, if I would just French-kiss him spontaneously once a day; I gave up first. (I found the forced affection claustrophobic. I was also still stung, I later realized, by critical comments Dan had made about my kissing style before we were engaged.) These were many-times-told tales, and as such we both felt inured to their dark content. We used them to avoid committing what Doherty calls “therapist-induced marital suicide.” We did not want therapy to set a pick for our divorce.

So instead of speaking our harshest truths, for six weeks running Dan and I pursued the lesser offense of making the other sound crazy. Holly cooperated, too, offering feedback that we used to confirm our sense that the other was neurotic. Some weeks Dan took it in the teeth; others, I did. At home, Dan and I had been following a de facto acceptance strategy. He even convinced me that the best response to his lecturing me, again, about conjugate-periodization strength training was for me to say, “Oh, you lovable, obsessive man, you!” and walk away. But Holly took a fix-it, or at least diagnose-it, approach. This is another major complaint about marital therapy: mental-health professionals find mental-health problems. All of a sudden you’re married to a narcissistic personality disorder; who wants to stick around for that? One day Holly ended our session with this synopsis: “On the first count, you find Dan unavailable because he’s not relating to you. He’s just using you as a sounding board. But on the other hand he feels he can’t reach you either. He wants you to accept his affection and praise, but those attentions make you feel smothered, and that makes him feel alone.” I still believed our marriage was good. But I felt that Holly had reduced it to an unappealing, perhaps unfixable conundrum. Would her vote of little confidence hurt or help?

I did start watching my reactions when Dan told me that I looked beautiful. Did he mean it? What did he want from me? I would try to accept the compliment graciously, even offer one in return. But the endless therapy required to become less neurotic generally seemed outside the scope of this project. I felt confident we could build a better marriage, less so that our individual personalities would change. Marital therapy, to me, seemed akin to chemo: helpful but toxic. Leaving Holly’s office one day, Dan, ever valiant, made a strong play to titrate how much negative feedback we let in. “Do they spray shrink powder in these places,” he asked, “to make them extra depressing?”

Monogamy is one of the most basic concepts of modern marriage. It is also its most confounding. In psychoanalytic thought, the template for monogamy is forged in infancy, a baby with its mother. Marriage is considered to be a mainline back to this relationship, its direct heir. But there is a crucial problem: as infants we are monogamous with our mothers, but our mothers are not monogamous with us. That first monogamy — that template — is much less pure than we allow. “So when we think about monogamy, we think about it as though we are still children and not adults as well,” Adam Phillips notes. This was true for us. On our wedding day, Dan and I performed that elaborate charade: I walked down the aisle with my father. I left him to join my husband. We all shed what we told ourselves were tears of joy. Dan and I promised to forsake all others, and sexually we had. But we had not shed all attachments, naturally, and as we waded further into our project the question of allegiances became more pressing. Was our monogamy from the child’s or the mother’s perspective? Did my love for Dan — must my love for Dan — always come first?

This all came pouring out last summer in the worst fight of our marriage. At the time, we were at my parents’ house, an hour northeast of San Francisco. More than food, more than child-rearing, we fought about weekends — in particular, how many summer weekends to spend up there. I liked the place: out of the fog, free grandparental day care; the kids could swim. Dan loathed it, describing the locale as “that totally sterile golf community in which your mother feeds our kids popsicles for breakfast and I’m forbidden to cook.”

For the past few years I dismissed Dan’s complaints by saying, “Fine, don’t go.” I told myself this was justified, if not altruistic: I was taking our girls; Dan could do what he wanted with his free time. But underneath lay a tangle of subtext. Dan wished he spent even more time with his own parents, who were quite private. I felt an outsize obligation toward mine, because they moved to the Bay Area to be closer to us. We’d had some skilled conversations, which helped a bit, as I now knew those weekends with his in-laws made Dan feel alienated and left out of our family decision-making. Yet at root we fought because the issue rubbed a weak point in our marriage, in our monogamy: I didn’t want to see my devotion to my parents as an infidelity to Dan. To him, it was.

That June weekend my folks weren’t home, we’d gone up with friends, but Dan hated the place more than ever. Saturday morning I woke up early, went for a run and came back to find Dan on a small AstroTurf putting green with the girls, ranting about how he hated all the houses that looked the same, with tinted windows blocking the natural light; the golf course that obliterated the landscape and all the jerks that played golf on it. The next day was Father’s Day. I took the girls to do errands with what I thought were the best of intentions, but I was so angered by Dan’s relentless crabbiness that I failed to buy a gift. The final insult came Sunday afternoon as we packed to go home. I informed Dan that I told my mother that she could bring the girls back up the following weekend. Dan erupted in rage. “Those are my actual children. Why do you insist on treating me like I’m some potted plant? I, too, get to decide what happens in this family. Do I need to tell you to tell your mother, ‘O.K., Mom, I’m not allowed to make any plans for our children without getting permission from my husband?’ Do I need to be telling you, ‘I’m sorry, little girl, I make the plans in this family, and I’ll tell you what to tell your mother about where my children are going?’ ”

I stiffened and said, “Of course not.”

“How far are you going to let this go?” Dan kept screaming. “Are you willing to get divorced so you can keep spending weekends with your mom?”

This was the first time in our marriage either of us had ever invoked divorce.

The following Thursday, as we entered Holly’s office, I still felt certain she would side with me: Dan needed to get over his holier-than-thou Berkeley hang-ups. Sure, golf communities are snobbish, but family is much more important. Especially my family, right now — my parents had moved from Massachusetts to California to be near their grandchildren, for God’s sake. And besides, I dealt more with the kids, and I let Dan run amok in the kitchen. So I got this.

Holly, who’d thrown out her back and was reclining in a lawn chair in front of the couch she used for psychoanalytic clients, did not think much of my reasoning. “It sounds like you’ve created these little enclaves of rationalizations: ‘I give on all these other fronts, so I’m entitled not to give on this one.’ ”

She was right. I felt entitled.

“But that does pose a problem — for Dan. Because he feels he’s really not taken into account.”

Dan brightened. “Just as you were talking there, I was having all these fears come up again. I have a real fear of being an appendage in that family, and that Liz’s real family is her and her mother, and I was just a sperm donor. That it would be really fine if I disappeared. Nothing much would change.”

“Really?” I asked. I knew some of the ways I betrayed Dan with the girls. As they grew older we found ourselves forming cross-generation allegiances. Hannah, our elder, and I would wish Dan wasn’t so chronically messy and emotionally florid. Audrey, our younger, would promise to be Dan’s perfect companion; she would do the things I wouldn’t do: climb huge overhanging rock crags, eat whole fried smelt. But I understood less well why there was a conflict with my parents. I often spent 21 hours a day with Dan. When my mother called, I frequently didn’t answer the phone.

I could not believe Dan thought my primary relationship was with my mother. I needed to know if he felt that way generally or just on these weekends. Dan declared the distinction moot: any rupture in our monogamy weakened the whole. I wondered if improving my marriage had to mean cutting myself off from the world? I wanted to gain strength from my marriage — that was increasingly clear. In many ways I did. Dan had faith in me, and that helped me have faith in myself. But clearly I owed Dan a debt of constancy and consideration. Our marriage needed to be a place to gain strength for him too.

Near the end of our session, Holly asked what I thought would happen if I let go of my rationalizations, if I accepted a fuller monogamy. I said I would feel vulnerable, “like a beating heart with no rib cage.”

“So there’s a feeling that if you take Dan into account, he’s going to take it all away, or you’re going to have to give yourself over to him?”

“Yes,” I said. “I imagine I’m going to be squashed.”

Holly sat up in her lawn chair. “We’re going to have to stop for the day.”

Since the beginning of this project, Dan had been waiting for one thing: sex therapy. And I have good and bad news on this front: improving the sex in our marriage was much easier than you might guess, and the process of doing so made us want to throw up.

Here again we began with books. In “Can Love Last? The Fate of Romance Over Time,” Stephen A. Mitchell, a psychoanalyst, presents a strong case for the idea that those thoughts you might have about your spouse or your sex life being predictable or boring — that’s just an “elaborate fantasy,” a reflection of your need to see your partner as safe and knowable, so you don’t have to freak out over the possibility that he could veer off in an unforeseen direction, away from you.

Inspired by Mitchell, I decided to try a thought exercise: to think, while we were making love, that Dan was not predictable in the least. Before this, Dan and I were having regular sex, in every sense: a couple of times a week, not terribly inventive. As in many areas of our lives, we’d found a stable point that well enough satisfied our desires, and we just stayed there. But now I imagined Dan as a free actor, capable of doing anything at any time and paradoxically, by telling myself I did not know what to expect, I wanted to move toward him, to uncover the mystery. For years, of course, I felt I knew Dan well, worried that lessening the little distance between us could lead to collapse. Now I was having the same sweaty feelings I had in my 20s, when I would let my psyche ooze into that of a new lover at the start of an affair.

This was great, right? A better marriage meant more passionate sex, this went without saying. But by now I noticed a pattern: improving my marriage in one area often caused problems in another. More intimacy meant less autonomy. More passion meant less stability. I spent a lot of time feeling bad about this, particularly the fact that better sex made me retreat. There’s a school of thought that views sex as a metaphor for marriage. Its proponents write rational-minded books like Patricia Love and Jo Robinson’s “Hot Monogamy,” in which they argue, “When couples share their thoughts and emotions freely throughout the day, they create between them a high degree of trust and emotional connection, which gives them the freedom to explore their sexuality more fully.” But there’s this opposing school: sex — even sex in marriage — requires barriers and uncertainty, and we are fools to imagine otherwise. “Romantic love, at the start of this century, is cause for embarrassment,” Cristina Nehring moans in “A Vindication of Love: Reclaiming Romance for the Twenty-First Century.” She berates the conventional marital set-up: two spouses, one house, one bedroom. She’s aghast at those who strive for equality. “It is precisely equality that destroys our libidos, equality that bores men and women alike.” I can only imagine what scorn she’d feel for hypercompanionate idiots like us.

Still, I agreed with Nehring’s argument that we need “to rediscover the right to impose distances, the right to remain strangers.” Could my postcoital flitting away be a means to re-establish erotic distance? An appealing thought but not the whole truth. My relationship with Dan started on rocky footing. When we met, Dan was working through the aftershocks of a torrid affair with an emotionally sadistic, sexually self-aggrandizing woman. She said mean things to him; he said mean things to me (“Why do you kiss like that?”). Not a perfect foundation for a marriage. Nor was the fact that Dan spent the early years of ours writing an erotic bildungsroman about this nightmare ex-girlfriend, the novel at one point ballooning to 500 pages and including references to everyone he’d ever slept with. Even after the book was published, I never quite shook the feeling that my role in Dan’s life was to be the steady, vanilla lay. We never discussed this. We just had a strenuously normal sex, year after year after year.

Then one day at my desk I started reading “The Multi-Orgasmic Couple: Sexual Secrets Every Couple Should Know.” I sent Dan an e-mail message entitled “Nine Taoists Thrusts.”

1. Strike left and right as a brave general breaking through the enemy ranks.

2. Rise and suddenly plunge like a wild horse bucking through a mountain stream.

3. Push and pull out like a flock of seagulls playing on the waves.

4. Use deep thrusts and shallow teasing strokes, like a sparrow plucking pieces of rice.

5. Make shallow and then deeper thrusts in steady succession.

6. Push in slowly as a snake entering its hole.

7. Charge quickly like a frightened mouse running into its hole.

8. Hover and then strike like an eagle catching an elusive hare.

9. Rise up and then plunge down low like a great sailboat in a wild wind.

This e-mail was partly in response to one Dan sent me a few months earlier, just to see how much he could tweak my type-A sensibility. It was entitled “Strength Benchmarks for Women” and indicated that I should be able to do 10 pull-ups, 20 bar dips, front squat and bench press my body weight and dead lift one and a half times my body weight. Upon receiving the thrust e-mail, Dan ran up to my office in the attic from his in the basement and asked which thrust sounded best. This was a departure for us — after I felt rebuffed in some early attempts to make use of some kitschy erotic wedding presents, we settled into our safe, narrow little bowling alley of a sex life.

Now, high above noisy Franklin Street, in the office of our therapist, Betsy Kassoff, our issues came pouring out. (We chose to see a psychologist who worked on sexuality, because we weren’t contending with physical dysfunction.) Dan began with an exhaustive history. “When I was 15 years old I was dating a girl. . . .” I can’t tell you how monumentally tired I was of hearing about Dan’s ex-girlfriends. Could we please never discuss this again? “We had this completely psychologically sadistic thing that was incredibly disturbing to me. . . . Every few years I’d have a relationship that mirrored that one, and then I had the bull moose of these relationships. It was like sticking my finger in the electrical socket of my own unconscious.”

Betsy, who had a touch as deft as Bill Clinton at a barbecue, just said, “Wow.”

Dan and I had talked around the edges of this before — the trauma of the bull moose, our romance’s unpleasant start. But by the time either of us had any clarity on the matter, we were desperate to pack it away. Strange, now, what relief we felt in opening that rank old hamper. Betsy could not have said more than 50 words before Dan paused, and I jumped in.

Remember that searing detail from the Eliot Spitzer scandal: that he had sex in his socks? Way worse stuff came out. Like how Dan and I hadn’t been talking to each other while having sex. And not making eye contact either. “And what about the darker, more aggressive side of sexuality you talked about in your earlier relationships?” Betsy asked Dan. “Would you say it’s been more difficult to bring those parts of yourself to this relationship?”

Betsy worked gently and efficiently, a nurse undressing a wound. I confessed my craving but also my worry that we could not be sexually aggressive without conjuring the bull moose. Dan swore — eagerly — that this was not the case. The layers of our erotic life kept pulling back. I allowed that I felt hemmed in by our excessively regular sex life and annoyed that, in the context of our marriage, Dan supposedly had an important sexual history while I had none. Dan then admitted his fantasies about my past lovers, his fear that they had accessed parts of me that were walled off from him. How, nine years into our marriage, could our sex life still be under the thumbs of exes we no longer talked to or even desired? The thought made me angry and nauseated.

Fifty minutes later, Dan and I stumbled down onto the street, wrung out and dazed. Then we went home and solved the problem, at least at first. I hate to sound all Ayelet Waldman here, trumpeting her steamy sex life with Michael Chabon, but we had excellent sex. We were terrified not to. Yet once we proved to ourselves that we weren’t fools to be married — that we could have as charged an erotic life with each other as we had with others before — the backslide began. This time, the retreat was painful and abrupt. One day Dan found a box of old snapshots in the basement and brought it upstairs, thinking he’d show his old self to our daughters. The cache turned out to include pictures I saved of ex-boyfriends, photos Dan proceeded to fling, to the girls’ great amusement, across the room.

“Remind me again why you invited so many ex-lovers to our wedding?” Dan e-mailed me at 6 the following morning — neither of us could sleep. “Also, at the time, you had told me that you’d never slept with two of them. It only emerged later over time that you had. So what was going on there? Not completely ready to relinquish the past? Immaturity? Self-protection? Are you enjoying having a sexual history, too?”

In his novel “Before She Met Me,” Julian Barnes explores the rabid jealousy we feel for spouses’ former lovers, as if we expect our partners to have lived in anticipation of meeting us. This jealousy, Barnes writes, comes “in rushes, in sudden, intimate bursts that winded you.” It then lingers on “unwanted, resented.” This was our experience. The inquisition continued for days. Why had I not told Dan I’d slept with _______? I lied 11 years earlier for the weakest of reasons: I lacked the presence of mind to tell Dan the truth, that I did not yet think he had a right to know all the details of my sex life before him. But now Dan was my husband, my full catastrophe. He allowed this reckless poking into all corners of our marriage. He even stopped seeing me as predictable and tame, and the old lie hurt. “This is the central trust issue in a marriage,” Dan said the next day as he made me lunch. “Can I trust you when you tell me you haven’t slept with somebody else?”

The following weekend: jealousy again (or was it an attempt to fuel our eroticism with tension?). I said yes a bit too forcefully when Dan asked if I’d noticed a well-muscled young man at the pool. Dan was allowing for my sexual free agency, granting me my full humanity. We lived, raised children, worked and slept together. Now we needed to gouge out a gap to bridge, an erotic synapse to cross. It was exhausting. “That guy did the epitome of bad-values hypertrophy training” — vanity weight lifting, in Dan’s estimation, just to get buff. “You’re like a guy admitting he likes fake boobs. And he had chicken legs. Did you notice that, too?”

What is a good marriage? How good is good enough? Ultimately each philosophy of what makes a good marriage felt like a four-fingered glove. The passion apologists placed no stock in the pleasures of home. The communication gurus ignored life history. I came to view the project as a giant attempt to throw everything out of the messy closet that was our life and put it back in a way that resembled an ad for the Container Store. Not everything fit. It never would. We could tidy up any given area and more quickly and easily than we anticipated. But despite ongoing sessions with endless professionals, we couldn’t keep the entirety of our marriage shipshape at once.

Still, night after night, I’d slide into bed next to Dan. He often slept in a white T-shirt and white boxer briefs, a white-cased pillow wrapped over his head to block out my reading light, his toppled stacks of cookbooks and workout manuals strewn on the floor. He looked like a baby, fresh and full of promise. In psychiatry, the term “good-enough mother” describes the parent who loves her child well enough for him to grow into an emotionally healthy adult. The goal is mental health, defined as the fortitude and flexibility to live one’s own life — not happiness. This is a crucial distinction. Similarly the “good-enough marriage” is characterized by its capacity to allow spouses to keep growing, to afford them the strength and bravery required to face the world.

In the end, I settled on this vision of marriage, felt the logic of applying myself to it. Maybe the perversity we all feel in the idea of striving at marriage — the reason so few of us do it — stems from a misapprehension of the proper goal. In the early years, we take our marriages to be vehicles for wish fulfillment: we get the mate, maybe even a house, an end to loneliness, some kids. But to keep expecting our marriages to fulfill our desires — to bring us the unending happiness or passion or intimacy or stability we crave — and to measure our unions by their capacity to satisfy those longings, is naïve, even demeaning. Of course we strain against marriage; it’s a bound canvas, a yoke. Over the months Dan and I applied ourselves to our marriage, we struggled, we bridled, we jockeyed for position. Dan grew enraged at me; I pulled away from him. I learned things about myself and my relationship with Dan I had worked hard not to know. But as I watched Dan sleep — his beef-heart recipe earmarked, his power lift planned — I felt more committed than ever. I also felt our project could begin in earnest: we could demand of ourselves, and each other, the courage and patience to grow.
212 2009-12-06 Like a kooky media divinity, a god in a comic book myth, Williams, 45, is permeable, superpotent and with no observable boundaries. She performs tricks on the air that involve her surgically amplified bosom. She suggests to guests like Omarosa Manigault Stallworth, the confrontational star of that she look into facial fillers to correct the marionette lines that frame her stiff, practiced smile. She vows to keep her audience up to date on her vaginal toning. She cries, but then on television lately it’s hard to shut off the waterworks.

“You just have the audacity and the unmitigated gall to say what you think and let the chips fall where they may,” Williams said. And she does. Unlike actual drag queens like RuPaul, whose talk-show persona is decorous, ladylike and flat, Williams transferred to television unfiltered, the raunchy, insinuating and wisecracking attack doll she had become during the decades she spent in New York and as a radio personality.

In 2003, long before cajoled Whitney Houston into making some clear statement about her drug use, Williams harangued the star on radio. So relentless was her insistence that had a problem that the star eventually let slip the demure mask perfected on her road to multiplatinum crossover status and pulled a metaphoric razor from her wig. “If this were back in the day in Newark, I’d meet you outside,” the singer said.

“Yeah, it’s a legendary interview,” Williams recently said with a theatrical sigh, speaking by telephone from her house in suburban , where she lives with her husband, who is also an executive producer of her show, and their 9-year-old son.

“That’s when TV Guide knew who Wendy was,” she added. “It was when the bells and whistles and bombs got hung on this Christmas tree called Wendy, with all the gaudiness and all the presents underneath.”

The Christmas tree, it will surprise some to learn, went to charm school. “People don’t believe it,” said Williams, the second of three children raised in Ocean Township, N.J.; their parents, both educators, took them to Oak Bluffs, the elite African-American enclave on , every summer and remain married to each other after half a century. “I was a dedicated candy striper too,” she added. “I was a Brownie and a Girl Scout.”

Later in life, the energy that once went into earning Healthy Habits and People Are Talking badges was applied to shoveling epic quantities of cocaine up her nose. Williams makes no secret of this fact or of her other missteps. She makes no secret of anything, really, and for that reason, perhaps, it is somehow less startling when she “puts everyone else’s business in the street,” as she put it.

“My personal life tended at a certain point to be sloppy and messy,” Williams confessed. “On close examination, that was due to nothing more than me trying to break free from the chains that bound me.”

That same self-appraisal also led Williams, who had tried to break into television before without success, to play up her outsize nature — and those elements of her persona that went missing when she auditioned for a Buena Vista talk-show pilot that called for her to wear flat-front khakis, loafers and her hair in a tasteful short bob. “Thank God that didn’t work out,” she said. “The culture then wasn’t ready for the real Wendy.”

The real Wendy, for whom in truth the culture may not yet be altogether ready, “is the big hair” and the big mouth, the creature whose trademark phrase (“How you doin’?”) is spoken in a down-low drawl whose natural habitat might be the defunct drag festival Wigstock and who will always keep her audience up to date on her most intimate goings-on.

“I will let you know if I switch from a super tampon to a mini,” said Williams, who recently held a Kegel contest with her hairdresser and wardrobe mistress to see how long they could maintain a vaginal .

“We held for a full commercial break,” she said.

You grew up in Pennsylvania, and yet you fell in love with country music at a young age. What did you hear that attracted you to country?

LeAnn Rimes. I heard “Blue” by LeAnn Rimes, and that song resonated with me. It was nine years ago. She was young — around 14 — and I was about 10 when I heard it and she was doing these things that I could only dream about doing. There was something just so motivating about that.

Did you know what, or where, Nashville was?

I was watching a special on TV about the singer Faith Hill, and she talked about how she went to Nashville. That’s the moment that I realized that Nashville is where you need to be if you want to sing country music. And so every day I would beg my parents nonstop: “We need to go to Nashville. Can we please go to Nashville?” When I was 11, we went during spring break. I had been singing karaoke and I competed in karaoke competitions. So, I had this little demo CD of me singing karaoke music, and my mom would pull up outside one of the record labels on Music Row in Nashville and I would run in and say to the receptionist, “Hi, I’m Taylor. I’m 11. I want a record deal. Call me.”

No. My hair was always too big for that. I wore jeans and probably some sort of sparkly shirt.

How did your classmates regard your music?

I didn’t really have that many friends at school. Kids would just heckle me: “Oh, go sing that country beep.” It just dawned on me that I had to love being different or else I was going to end up being dark and angry and frustrated by school. Sometimes I felt like I was some sort of spy because I would go to school during the day, and then, after school, I had this life that was completely different. I definitely was more nervous walking into my first day of freshman year in high school than I was walking up to record labels and handing them my CD. In school, I learned to stop talking about music because they didn’t like it when I did. I led a double life. I kind of started to live in fear when I would sing the national anthem at the 76ers game. If there was a write-up about it the next day in our local paper, I knew it was gonna be a bad day at school for me.

Your mother loved Def Leppard. She played that nonstop when she was pregnant with you.

I love Def Leppard! It’s comforting for me to listen to them. I love a great song. If that great song is by 50 Cent, I’ll listen to it.

You started writing songs when you were 12, and nearly all your songs are autobiographical. Was that a way of coping with being an outsider at school?

Absolutely. I would sit on the edge of class and watch people interact with each other. I’d watch guys flirt with cool girls and I would watch best friends talk, and I would go home and write about it. If you listen to my albums, it’s like reading my diary.

And you always use real names in your songs.

I don’t hesitate — people who have no idea that I have a crush on them won’t find out through me telling them, but they will find out when they hear their name in a song. There was this guy who opened a couple of shows for me on tour and I talked to him a couple of times, but he never knew that I liked him. So I wrote this song called “Hey Stephen,” and when my album came out, I sent him a text message: “Hey, Track 5.” It was so funny. He sent me back a long e-mail saying, “Oh, my God!”

You recently finished filming a movie called “Valentine’s Day.” Did you like acting?

Yes, but it’s a small part. I play the kind of girl I didn’t like in high school. She’s forced to go to gym class and doesn’t want to be there. The director, Garry Marshall, was wonderful — and both of our lucky numbers are 13, so we talked about that most of the time.

Do you still sing karaoke?

No. But if I were to do karaoke, it would probably be something from “Grease” ! I’d sing “You’re the One That I Want” — or Def Leppard. Whenever I hear Def Leppard, I just freak out.

218 2009-12-07 At first, my patient insisted that everything was just fine. He and his wife had been trying to conceive for more than a year. He was ecstatic at the prospect of fatherhood, and he did not acknowledge feeling depressed or suicidal.

Suspicious of his rosy appraisal, I pushed a little.

It turned out that he had just taken a new high-pressure job in finance six months before the birth of his son. Though he was reluctant to admit it, he clearly had more than a little concern about his family’s financial future.

And he was anxious about his marriage and his new life. “We go out a lot with friends to dinner and theater,” he said wistfully, as I recall. “Now I guess that’s all going to end.”

He had spent the nine months of pregnancy in a state of excitement about being a father without really registering what a life-transforming event it was going to be.

Unlike women, men are not generally brought up to express their emotions or ask for help. This can be especially problematic for new fathers, since the prospect of parenthood carries all kinds of insecurities: What kind of father will I be? Can I support my family? Is this the end of my freedom?

And there is probably more to male postpartum depression than just social or psychological stress; like motherhood, fatherhood has its own biology, and it may actually change the brain.

A 2006 study on marmoset monkeys, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reported that new fathers experienced a rapid increase in receptors for the hormone vasopressin in the brain’s prefrontal cortex. Along with other hormones, vasopressin is involved in parental behavior in animals, and it is known that the same brain area in humans is activated when parents are shown pictures of their children.

There is also some evidence that testosterone levels tend to drop in men during their partner’s pregnancy, perhaps to make expectant fathers less aggressive and more likely to bond with their newborns. Given the known association between depression and low testosterone in middle-aged men, it is possible that this might also put some men at risk of postpartum depression.

By far the strongest predictor of paternal postpartum depression is having a depressed partner. In one study, fathers whose partners were also depressed were at nearly two and a half times the normal risk for depression. That was a critical finding, for clinicians tend to assume that men can easily step up to the plate and help fill in for a depressed mother. In fact, they too may be stressed and vulnerable to depression.

And there is the child to think about. Research has clearly shown that maternal postpartum depression can impair the emotional and cognitive development of infants. A father could well buffer the infant from some of the adverse effects of maternal depression — but that is a tall order if he too is depressed.

Dr. Ramchandani, who also followed children for three and a half years after birth, reported that they were affected differently depending on which parent was depressed. Maternal postpartum depression was associated with adverse emotional and behavioral effects in children regardless of sex; depression in fathers was linked only with behavioral problems in boys. (The study did not report on possible effects when both parents were depressed.)

As for my patient, he recovered within two months with the help of psychotherapy and an antidepressant. Afterward, he summed up the situation in just 10 words: “And I thought only women get this kind of thing.”

All too many doctors think so too.

222 2009-12-07 A top Republican senator, Charles E. Grassley, has sent letters to the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society and 31 other disease and medical advocacy organizations asking them to provide details about the amount of money that they and their directors receive from drug and device makers.

Such funding amounts are often considered proprietary by the organizations and their directors, but critics contend that the industry’s sway over such groups leads them to lobby on industry’s behalf.

Mike Lynch, a spokesman for the A.M.A., said the organization had received the senator’s letter and would respond. He said industry funding comprised less than 2 percent of the organization’s budget. Steve Weiss, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society, sent an e-mail stating that the society “holds itself to the highest standards of transparency and public accountability, and we look forward to working with Senator Grassley to provide the information he requested." Kate Meyer, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association, which also received a letter from the senator, said the organization “was going to answer all of his questions,” but she would not immediately say what share of the organization’s funding comes from drug or device makers.

The letter from the Iowa Republican is part of his long-running investigation into the pervasive influence of drug and device makers on the practice of medicine. Mr. Grassley has also long been interested in how charities get and spend their tax-deductible contributions.

“These organizations have a lot of influence over public policy, and people rely on their leadership,” Mr. Grassley said. “There’s a strong case for disclosure and the accountability that results.”

245 2009-12-07 Stadiums and arenas with corporate names are common in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia. From the United Center in Chicago to the Acer Arena in Sydney, modern sports and entertainment palaces are more likely to carry the names of banks, retailers, soft-drink makers or airlines than of cities, governors or teams.

But major naming-rights deals for indoor sporting sites have bypassed China, until now.

On Monday, Mercedes-Benz will announce a 10-year agreement that is worth $75 million to $100 million to put its name on a new 18,000-seat arena in Shanghai.

At that price, the agreement is worth about one-third to one-half the annual fee that Citigroup is paying to attach its name to Citi Field, the home of the Mets.

The size and location of the Shanghai deal are significant because the recession has rendered the naming-rights market dormant. The Giants and the Jets have not found a buyer for the name to their new stadium in the Meadowlands after talks with the German insurer Allianz collapsed. And efforts to sell the name to Beijing’s National Stadium — the Bird’s Nest, as it was called during the 2008 Summer Olympics — are in abeyance.

The arena, which will bear the Mercedes-Benz name beginning in 2011, appears to be the first in China with a corporate name. It also represents a major success in the joint effort by the N.B.A. and AEG, which owns and runs dozens of arenas and stadiums worldwide, to develop a dozen arenas in China.

247 2009-12-07 “Despite advanced warning, state and local governments were unable to evacuate effectively, or provide adequate food and water to those who remained behind,” Mr. Markey said in a statement.

He argued that advance preparation would be more effective than waiting until after a disaster to act.

The federal government already helps the 31 states with commercial nuclear plants stock pills for people within 10 miles, and some states have already distributed them in that zone. The provision sought to extend that radius to 20 miles.

But John H. Marburger III, who was the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Bush administration and who wrote the policy that is now in force, said that the chances of a problem beyond the 10-mile radius were small, and that moving people who were directly in the path of the plume would be easier than distributing pills in advance.

And if some pills were pre-distributed in the area, people would be preoccupied with finding them rather than paying attention to whether they were in the path of the plume, which would be relatively narrow, Dr. Marburger said in a telephone interview.

Distributing them might also have a “misleading psychological effect,” he said, suggesting that the drug would protect against all health effects, rather than just the effect of radioactivity on the thyroid.

Some states offer the pills to all residents within 10 miles of a plant but find that most do not want them. Dr. Marburger said that some states were not doing a good job of making the pills available within 10 miles of a plant and that he had recommended improvements.

Potassium iodide is hard to find in bricks-and-mortar stores but is available on the Internet, without a prescription. Federal guidelines stress its importance for children and young adults, whose thyroid glands are most vulnerable to radioactive iodine.

A National Academy of Sciences study ordered by the 2002 law concluded that the drug “should be available to everyone at risk of significant health consequences from the accumulation of radioiodine in the thyroid.”

The study also recommended that distribution “be included in the planning for comprehensive radiological incident response programs.”

Dr. Marburger said, though, that the study did not refer to the situation of people beyond 10 miles.

The idea of stocking the pills is drawing renewed support from groups that supported it in the past. “This implementation is long overdue,” Dr. Helen Binns, chairwoman of the Council on Environmental Health at the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.

Her organization favors stocking potassium iodide in schools, day care centers and other places where children are often gathered, given that their thyroid glands would particularly be at risk.

Potassium iodide works by saturating the thyroid with iodine so that it cannot absorb any radioactive iodine that is released from a reactor. But it works only if administered before exposure to the radioactive iodine occurs, experts point out.

The government’s position on potassium iodide has flipped back and forth for three decades. After the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in March 1979, federal officials scrambled to find a pharmaceutical company that could produce it immediately. The drug was not used, however.

Champions of nuclear power argued that the chance of release of iodine was so small that distributing drugs in advance over a wide area would only undercut public confidence in the safety of nuclear power.

Speaking for the American Thyroid Association, Dr. Elizabeth Pearce, an endocrinologist at the Boston University School of Medicine, emphasized that stocks of the pills had to be on hand in the event of a nuclear incident. “There’s a fairly narrow time window for it to be effective,” she said.

Hurricane Katrina was “a superb example of why you need advance preparation on the ground,” she added.
248 2009-12-07 I guess folks in the 19th century thought slavery was a personal choice, not a political issue. But those people were proved very wrong. Just because someone is a different color or from a different culture or is just beginning to form a life, that someone has a right to live and grow in freedom with all the dignity of a human being.

Abortion is a social issue, as well as a moral issue. No one religion can claim it as its own.

Embarrassment from an unplanned pregnancy or economic hardship — are these really reasons to choose to end a life?

Mr. Levine dismisses talk about the potential impact of the Stupak amendment as an exaggeration of what would change for women. Eighty-seven percent of employer-based health plans currently provide coverage for abortion care. If the Stupak amendment or equally restrictive language were included in the final version of the health care reform bill, millions of women could risk losing their coverage.

No woman plans to have an abortion. The individual circumstances for this choice are as varied as the women themselves; fetal anomalies, health risks and spousal abuse do not discriminate based on age, income or insurance status.

Likewise, Mr. Levine’s contention that nothing would change for uninsured women or women covered by Medicaid does little to advance his argument. Restrictions on public funding for abortion are one of the biggest barriers to women seeking abortion care. Just because these restrictions are already in place does not mean that further limitations should be accepted.

Meaningful reform of health care cannot take place by sacrificing the well-being of half of the citizens of this country.

Thank you for publishing “False Alarm on Abortion,” by Phillip B. Levine. Finally, someone is approaching the Stupak amendment with rationality and a calculated sense for women’s health, rather than with ideology and vitriol.

Health care for all and better health care in general inevitably mean tangible benefits for women’s reproductive health. If the only way we can get to this desired state is through compromising on an issue that, in reality, will have marginal effects, if any, on women’s reproductive health, then it is a worthy sacrifice.

In a commentary filled with statistics, there is one critical measure that Phillip B. Levine did not mention: one in three American women will have an abortion in her lifetime.

That means when we talk about health care reform and abortion, we are talking about a sister, a friend, a loved one who has faced this decision. And for her, the statistics don’t mean that much.

So I would ask Mr. Levine to look that woman in the eye and tell her that it doesn’t matter if she loses her coverage. Tell her that the promise of health care reform — that nobody would lose coverage — was for everyone else.
249 2009-12-07 Nobody should expect a planet-saving agreement from the negotiations that begin this week in Copenhagen aimed at reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases. But the talks were in real danger of blowing up not long ago. Now there is a good chance for at least an interim deal, mainly because the United States and China, the world’s two biggest emitters, have promised to reduce or slow their emissions and their two leaders have agreed to attend.

An interim deal would still leave a great deal for President Obama to do, starting with getting Congress to deliver on the promises he is taking to Copenhagen. Mr. Obama has pledged a modest cut of 17 percent over the next 10 years and more aggressive cuts in later decades. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s proposal to slow the growth in China’s emissions is considerably less ambitious because energy efficiency measures that China has already put in place should be enough to do the job.

Still, neither country has offered specific goals before. Their 11th-hour willingness to do so could be just enough to persuade the other 190 countries in Copenhagen to take the first step in what is now seen as a two-stage process. It would start with a nonbinding political agreement to reduce emissions and give aid to developing countries. This would be followed by a legal agreement next year with firm targets, enforcement mechanisms and specific dollar amounts for poorer countries.

In other words, the tough slog lies ahead. Copenhagen is all about attitudes and aspirations. Next year will be about results. And there can be no meaningful outcome without the leadership of the United States  second only to China in overall emissions and the biggest emitter by far in terms of per capita emissions.

The president’s proposed reductions are in line with a bill approved by the House last summer. A Senate committee has approved a slightly stronger measure calling for a 20 percent reduction in the next decade and an 83 percent reduction by midcentury. But its approval on the Senate floor is far from certain. Most Republicans are opposed. There are deep doubts among Democrats from Rust Belt states with energy-intensive industries. Getting to a filibuster-proof 60 votes will require every bit of Mr. Obama’s persuasive powers  and a real push by the Senate’s often-passive Democratic leaders.

The challenges on the foreign front are no less formidable. The consensus among mainstream climate scientists is that the world must cut emissions in half by midcentury. The rich countries cannot do it alone. Even if they cut their emissions by 80 percent by midcentury  a goal endorsed by the Group of 8 highly industrialized nations  the world would fall short of its target unless the developing countries pitched in.

Brazil, Indonesia and India have put offers on the table; others may come forward now that China has agreed to act. But the divide between rich and developing nations, let alone very poor countries, remains great. Further progress may depend on how much countries that have already reaped the benefits of industrialization  and contributed hugely to global warming  will be willing to ante up to help others adapt to climate change and reduce emissions. Brazil, for instance, has said it will protect its rainforests from clear-cutting and burning only if rich countries “pay the price.”

European leaders have urged the creation of a global climate assistance fund for exactly that purpose, with a minimum annual contribution from wealthy countries of $10 billion. The White House announced late last week that the United States would pay its “fair share.” That is good news. But here again the president will need Congress’s consent. He has a huge selling job ahead if he expects to seal a comprehensive deal.
250 2009-12-07 Of course, the government’s potential losses extend beyond the Treasury program. The Federal Reserve, for example, still holds a trillion-dollar portfolio of mortgage-backed securities whose market value is unknown.

The improved picture of the Treasury program is the result of higher-than-expected returns on the loans and the fact that, as the financial sector has recovered from its free fall last year, the government has not had to use much more of its $700 billion in lending authority this year, according to the Treasury officials, who declined to be identified as discussing the report before it was presented to Congress.

Last week, Bank of America became the latest big bank to say that it was raising private capital and would soon repay its $45 billion bailout loan. Once that payment is made, Citigroup will be the last big bank tethered to the state.

The estimated $42 billion in losses is a net figure that accounts for some profits to offset the losses. The Treasury officials said the government had lost about $60 billion, roughly half to Chrysler and General Motors and the other half to the insurance giant American International Group.

But the government is projecting a $19 billion profit and perhaps more on the $245 billion lent to banks, through interest, dividends and the sale of warrants the government received as collateral.

Aside from the rare good news for the federal deficit, the latest bailout accounting could have political and legislative ramifications.

Politically, the Treasury program has been unpopular ever since it was created in October 2008 by former President George W. Bush and a Congress controlled by Democrats. It has grown only more reviled over time as a symbol for many Americans of the government’s perceived favoritism toward Wall Street, which is making money, over Main Street, which continues to struggle and shed jobs.

An anti-Washington anger is disturbing both parties as they approach a midterm election year, and some Republican lawmakers have drawn primary opponents largely because of their votes last year in favor of the bailout program.

It was unclear how that climate might be altered as taxpayers realize they did not actually lose $700 billion to help big banks. At most, the Treasury officials said, the ultimate losses will be one-fifth of that amount and probably less.

Democrats in Congress have already decided to divert about $70 billion from what is left in the bailout fund to the cost of additional road-building and other construction projects, credit to small businesses and further aid to state and local governments.

The administration had wanted to dedicate unspent bailout money to the deficit but signaled to Congressional leaders late last week that it would not oppose their plans. President Obama is expected to touch on those ideas and others in an economic speech on Tuesday.

The bailout program is due to expire at the end of the year, but the Treasury has indicated it will use the authority it was granted by Congress to extend it into 2010.

The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, testified last week to a Senate committee that “nothing would make me happier than to end this as quickly as possible,” but he added, “we’re not quite there yet.”

Mr. Geithner, who has become the administration’s lightning rod for anger among both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, said “there are parts of the system that are still very damaged” — in banking, housing, commercial real estate and credit-starved small businesses.

He said the administration would propose within weeks when and how to end the program safely.

At that hearing, he hinted at the Treasury’s improved forecast for the program, saying “we’re going to be able to return very, very substantial amounts of money to address the critical economic needs, long-term fiscal needs, of this country.”

That prediction contrasts with the administration’s planning soon after Mr. Obama took office in January. Fearing that additional bank failures could exhaust the entire $700 billion fund, they proposed up to $500 billion more in federal lending authority in the administration’s first budget in February.

Instead, just $7 billion more in bailout money has gone out to banks since Mr. Obama became president, making a second loan authorization unnecessary. Meanwhile, banks have raised 16 times as much, $114 billion, in private capital, according to the Treasury.

Since the Treasury subjected big banks to “stress tests” last winter to determine how much private capital they must raise to withstand future financial shocks, the financial institutions have been eager to do so, in order to repay the government and thereby exit the Treasury’s rescue program — not least to escape the restrictions on executive compensation that come with it.

Mr. Geithner now says that banks will repay $175 billion by the end of next year. To date, counting Bank of America’s promised payment, banks have repaid $116 billion, according to the Treasury. Also, in coming weeks the Treasury will sell more of the government’s bank warrants to investors.
251 2009-12-07 Pitcher John Lackey and outfielders Matt Holliday and Jason Bay are the marquee free agents whose names and potential destinations will be bouncing off the walls, but there should be a lot more top names being thrown around this time next year.

Lackey is the ace of this class, but he might be the fifth-best pitcher on the list if he were a free agent next season. Cliff Lee, Roy Halladay and Brandon Webb, former Cy Young Award winners, and Josh Beckett, a 20-game winner, could be free agents then. If the Toronto Blue Jays trade Halladay, as expected, he will want to sign a contract extension so that he will not have to switch teams again after 2010.

Like Lackey, Holliday and Bay would have more competition if they were free agents next season. The Yankees’ Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera and the Twins’ Joe Mauer will probably sign extensions, but all three could still be free agents. In addition, Carl Crawford, Victor Martinez, Manny Ramirez, Carlos Pena, Adam Dunn and Jayson Werth could also test the market after 2010.

Because more premium players will be available next year, general managers may take the opposite approach that Cashman took with Teixeira and simply wait. Some executives said they must be careful to evaluate what a player was worth to their team and not change that just because he garnered more interest in a lean free-agent year.

The Yankees, who spent almost half a billion dollars on free agents a year ago, have talked about lowering their payroll for 2010. If they steer away from the high-priced free agents, that could influence how much those players get from other teams. Michael Weiner, the head of the players’ union, said last week that he was “slightly concerned” with the sluggish pace of the market.

That was before Chone Figgins agreed to terms on a four-year, $36 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. Figgins, whose deal has not yet been officially announced, is a .291 career hitter. Although Figgins is a productive player, Lackey, Holliday and Bay are on a different level.

“It’s a market that has a lot of premium guys,” Mets General Manager Omar Minaya said. “Once you get beyond those guys, the other guys are pretty much the same.” When the Yankees chased Sabathia, they viewed him as a pitcher who could guide them to a championship. Lackey, who won 11 games last season, is not as powerful or as dominant as Sabathia. The team that signs Lackey will get a competitive pitcher who won the clinching game of the 2002 World Series. But he is not the durable ace that Sabathia is.

Because of Teixeira’s blend of power hitting and slick defense, Holliday and Bay fall short of being his equal. Scott Boras, who represents Teixeira and Holliday, has already compared Holliday to Teixeira as the best all-around free agent. Although Holliday is the best player available, scouts said that he was not as prized as Teixeira had been.

How barren is this free-agent group? Nick Johnson, a serviceable first baseman who has a career .402 on-base percentage, was listed as the fifth-best free agent, according to a free-agent ranking on SI.com. In September, Johnson ruminated about whether he could secure a two-year deal. He has a better chance of doing it in this off-season than in the next.
252 2009-12-07 OTTAWA  Like public health care, Canada’s tight gun-control laws help distinguish the country from its powerful neighbor to the south. But as Canadians commemorated the 20th anniversary of one of the country’s most notorious shooting sprees on Sunday, their Parliament was on course to eliminate one of its most significant gun-control measures.

A long-gun registry, which requires the registration of rifles and shotguns, emerged largely from public revulsion over the massacre in 1989.

A decade before the Columbine high school shootings set off a national debate on gun violence in the United States, an angry, unemployed 25-year-old armed with a semiautomatic hunting rifle stormed the École Polytechnique, an engineering school in Montreal. Shouting “I hate feminists,” the gunman separated the female students from the men and killed 14 women before killing himself.

The crime was the sort that, even then, most Canadians thought could happen only in the United States. The anniversary was observed Sunday, as it has been every year since, by ceremonies across the nation. In Montreal, hundreds of people linked arms around a park near the school and about 1,000 people attended a vigil at Notre-Dame Basilica.

Parliament’s response to the crime was passage of the long-gun registry, and few issues since have so divided rural and urban Canadians. The law’s looming demise has revived the national debate over gun control and, with the wounds of 1989 still tender, raised deep questions about Canadian identity.

“Canada is suddenly changing into a place that loves guns and armies and war,” said Gerald L. Caplan, a prominent academic and former campaign director of the liberal New Democratic Party. “I don’t know how we got there but I don’t like it.”

The law has been controversial since its approval in 1995, and there are competing theories as to why it suddenly appears doomed now. While Mr. Caplan cites a political shift signaled by the election of a Conservative government in 2006, many analysts credit an obscure Parliamentary maneuver by gun-control opponents that allowed them to assemble a voting majority.

Perhaps most surprisingly, the debate has pitted the Conservative government, which generally promotes a law and order agenda and wants to get rid of the law, against the police, who resoundingly favor keeping it. Arguments on both sides have been emotional, with opponents of the law adopting what Canadians consider to be American-style personal attack ads against gun-control advocates.

“This is so vicious, it’s amazing,” said Suzanne Laplante-Edward, whose 21-year-old daughter, Anne-Marie, was killed in the Montreal shooting. “The gun-control law is a monument erected to the memory of our daughters.”

The current debate does not involve handguns, whose registration has been required since 1934. Nor does it involve a variety of military-style weapons like assault rifles and sawed-off shotguns, which are banned outright. And the law’s repeal would not alter the requirement that gun buyers take safety courses and obtain a license.

But what it would do is hotly contested.

The current law requires the registration of the weapons themselves, rifle and shotguns, which account for 6.7 million of Canada’s 7.4 million registered guns, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Many police forces say that registry data, which they consulted 3.4 million times last year, prevents killings by allowing them to seize guns from homes where serious domestic disputes have been reported.

And many police officials warn that without mandatory registration, their officers will lose the ability to seize illegal guns found in the possession of criminal suspects. William Blair, the Toronto police chief and president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, said that information from the registry allowed his force to seize 58 illegal guns in October alone.

Killings involving guns have declined significantly since the gun registry began but it is unclear how much of that the registry is responsible for. Homicide rates have been dropping in Canada since the 1970s. And the registry itself, delayed for years by bureaucratic and software problems, has been operational for only a few years, limiting the data available for analysis.

Many recreational hunters, farmers and Native Canadians who hunt for food consider the law a useless and intrusive burden. “From the beginning and still today, the feeling has been that it’s going to do absolutely nothing about reducing crime,” said Dale R. Garnham, the president of the Manitoba Wildlife Federation, a hunting and fishing group, who added that his members have felt “unduly harassed” by the registration process, which is similar to applying for a passport.

Greg Farrant, a lobbyist for the Ontario Federation of Hunters and Anglers, said that gun license records are sufficient for the police to determine if guns are likely to be in, say, a home that is about to be raided. And, like many critics, he cites the cost of the registry, nearly $1 billion to set up, as a reason to dismantle it.

Previous efforts to abolish the registry were defeated because the Conservative government did not have enough votes to pass the bill alone and the registry had the support of all opposition parties. But the current bill has won two preliminary votes, exploiting a procedure that in certain cases frees opposition members from the requirement of voting along party lines.

The government waged an advertising campaign in rural areas represented by opposition parties, and in the end, eight Liberals and 12 New Democrats voted with the government at the bill’s second reading.

Early next year, the bill will begin the process toward a third and final reading. While opposition leaders could change course and demand that all their members vote against it, observers on both sides expect it to pass.

And in one more way, Canada will resemble its larger neighbor.

“While Canada has not always been perfect on not having a gun culture or not being at war, it was on the whole a handsome, different kind of reality,” Mr. Caplan said. “I’m guessing there is still more support for the old values out there than the political elite reflects, but that may have slipped.”
253 2009-12-07 Despite the mounting evidence, the industry built itself into a $150 billion business in the largely by winning over a crucial customer: the driver.

For years, it has marketed the virtues of cellphones to drivers. Indeed, the industry originally called them car phones and extolled them as useful status symbols in ads, like one from 1984 showing an executive behind the wheel that asked: “Can your secretary take dictation at 55 MPH?” (View a timeline of ads marketing cellphones to drivers, and studies showing their risks.)

“That was the business,” said Kevin Roe, a telecommunications industry analyst since 1993. Wireless companies “designed everything to keep people talking in their cars.”

They succeeded. The federal government estimated in 2007 that 11 percent of drivers were talking on their phones at any given time. But that success has come at a cost. Researchers at Harvard have estimated that, even seven years ago, drivers using cellphones were causing 2,600 fatal crashes a year in the United States and 570,000 accidents that resulted in a range of injuries, from minor to serious.

And studies show that a driver talking on a cellphone is four times likelier to crash and that using a hands-free device does not eliminate the risk.

The industry notes that the mobile device has moved well beyond its origins as a car phone and argues that research on the dangers of distracted driving is inconclusive, even as wireless companies have spent millions on campaigns to educate drivers.

But the industry’s chief spokesman, , acknowledged in recent interviews that those efforts have fallen short. He said the companies plan to do more, particularly in light of the explosion of , which they say poses a profoundly serious risk.

The CTIA, the industry’s trade group, supports legislation banning texting while driving. It has also changed its stance on legislation to ban talking on phones while driving — for years, it opposed such laws; now it is neutral.

“This was never something we anticipated,” said Mr. Largent, head of the CTIA, adding that distracted driving is a growing threat now that more than 90 percent of Americans have cellphones. “The reality of distracted driving has become more apparent to all of us.”

Critics of the industry argue that its education efforts over the years provided a weak counterbalance to its encouragement of cellphone use by drivers and to its efforts to fight regulations banning the use of cellphones while driving, or at least requiring drivers to use hands-free devices.

The critics — including safety advocates, researchers and families of crash victims — say the industry should do more, by placing overt warnings on the packaging and screens of cellphones.

The critics also say that even as the industry continues to pay lip service to the risks, companies are marketing a new generation of technology, like GPS applications for smartphones like the and BlackBerry, and wireless Internet access for cars. A description of one new application for the iPhone reads, “Maps on iPhone shows you live traffic information, indicating traffic speed along your route in easy-to-read green, red and yellow highlights.”

Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, was invited last month to speak about distracted driving by the . He told the audience that the cellphone industry was selling a product consumers can use dangerously — without properly warning them or providing safeguards.

He added: “The only questions are: what did they know, and when did they know it?”

On Oct. , 1983, hundreds of people, including reporters, photographers and TV crews, gathered at Soldier Field in for a special event.

An executive from Ameritech, the regional phone company that sponsored the event, sat in the driver’s seat of a convertible and phoned a great-grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, who was living in .

That call signified the introduction of mass-market commercial cellphone service, the equivalent of a moon shot for the telecommunications industry.

“The whole idea of placing a call from anywhere — without wires — it was amazing,” said Joe Colson, then a department head at Bell Labs, the prominent research arm of the nation’s telephone giants, who was part of the crowd.

Their work capped an effort that began decades earlier with radio telephones.

On its Web site today, notes that the first mobile telephone call, using that early radio technology, took place in 1946. An accompanying picture shows a trucker, phone to his ear. “A trucker rolls with one of the first mobile phones,” the caption says.

But because of the expense and limits of that radio technology, wireless phones were used early on mostly by truckers and other professional drivers. In the 1960s, AT&T says, had 2,000 customers with these phones, and they typically waited 30 minutes for a call to go through.

Early innovators, like Mr. Colson, saw new possibilities with the advent of smaller computer chips and batteries, as well as advances in wireless technology to simultaneously carry millions of conversations.

In ads, the industry promoted car phones as must-have accessories for the elite. In addition, it made sense to market to business people, who could justify the cost of cellphones as a way to make commuting time more productive.

In August 1987, an ad in for One, a mobile service provider, showed a man talking on a cellphone while driving a sports car with a surfboard in the back. The ad read: “You can reach all those important clients and still beat the traffic.”

A television commercial for Centel, an early cellphone provider that merged with , shows a handsome businessman leaving the city in his Jeep while talking on his phone. His wife is on the other end, using her own portable phone, standing in a speedboat.

The marketing paid off. Cellphones, including portable models with brick-size batteries, became status symbols, used by as Gordon Gekko in the 1987 movie (The first phones, like the one at Soldier Field, cost about $2,800, with installation — around $6,000 in today’s dollars.)

“It was like carrying around a Prada bag,” said Ray DeRenzo, now chief marketing officer for MobiTV, a TV service for phones, who in 1986 worked at Pacific Telesis.

In the late 1980s, one company even succeeded in selling tens of thousands of a $16 replica of a car phone called the “Cellular Phoney.” The company motto: “It’s not what you own, it’s what people think you own.”

In late 1985, wireless companies had 340,000 customers. Only 10 years later, as the price of phones fell sharply, there were almost 34 million.

The industry poured profits back into expanding networks. In just 10 years, the number of cell sites rose to 68,000 in 1995 from 913. The industry planted many cell sites near highways, partly because it was easier than persuading homeowners to put them in neighborhoods, and drivers were crucial customers.

Mr. Roe, the longtime industry analyst, estimates that in the 1980s and early ’90s, wireless companies got 75 percent or more of their revenue from drivers, a figure that fell below 50 percent by the mid-’90s and is now below 25 percent (the cellphone industry says it does not break out such figures).

In the late 1980s, the market remained heavily focused on drivers, even though the original car phones gave way to slimmer and less expensive portable cellphones.

Well into the 1990s, Mr. Roe said, wireless companies focused on three questions: “Can we cover the highways, do we have enough capacity to handle all the people on the highways, and is the signal strong enough?”

Mr. Colson, the engineer, said he was astonished by the popularity of cellphones, but he and others in the industry rarely paused to wonder about risks. “Driver distraction?” he said. “I mean, come on.”

Mr. Cooper, now 80, and commonly referred to as the father of the cellphone for his early work at Motorola, sensed early on that the technology had risks.

“I’d pass by the exit I was supposed to take because I was talking on the phone,” he said. Thinking back, he said he was “absolutely” aware of potential dangers but did not think roads would become filled with distracted drivers.

Other early innovators of cellphones said they felt nagging concerns. Bob Lucky, an executive director at Bell Labs from 1982-92, said he knew that drivers talking on cellphones were not focused fully on the road. But he did not think much about it or discuss it and supposed others did not, either, given the industry’s booming fortunes.

“If you’re an engineer, you don’t want to outlaw the great technology you’ve been working on,” said Mr. Lucky, now 73. “If you’re a marketing person, you don’t want to outlaw the thing you’ve been trying to sell. If you’re a C.E.O., you don’t want to outlaw the thing that’s been making a lot of money.”

Revenue for wireless service providers was soaring — to $16 billion in 1995 from $354 million in 1985. The industry had revenue of $148 billion in 2008.

One researcher who spoke up about his concerns was quickly shut down. In 1990, David Strayer, a junior researcher at GTE, which later became part of , noticed more drivers who seemed to be distracted by their phones, and it scared him. He asked a supervisor if the company should research the risks.

“Why would we want to know that?” Mr. Strayer recalled being told. He said the message was clear: “Learning about distraction would not be very helpful to the overall business model.”

Outside the industry, others started raising red flags. In 1984, the AAA urged drivers to park before using their phones. In 1991, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety financed a laboratory study that found that drivers talking on cellphones had difficulty responding to challenging situations.

In 1997, the Canadian Ministry of Health and other groups helped finance research to determine whether drivers distracted by cellphones were more likely to crash. The researchers’ answer: a resounding yes.

They found that drivers using cellphones were four times likelier to get into accidents than drivers who were focused entirely on the road.

“This relative risk is similar to the hazard associated with driving with a blood alcohol level at the legal limit,” the researchers wrote in The . They said hands-free devices were no safer than hand-held phones because of the distraction that comes from focusing on a conversation, not the road.

In subsequent years, dozens of researchers also determined that phone use by drivers divides attention, slows reaction time and increases the risks of crashing. Their ranks included Mr. Strayer, who left GTE for academia to research distracted driving.

Using a driving simulator at the , he showed that drivers distracted by calls miss otherwise obvious sights along a virtual highway and that they face a four times greater crash risk, echoing other studies’ findings.

The research was not easy for the industry to ignore, particularly given that a wireless company, AT&T, had helped pay for a widely publicized study.

AT&T paid Harvard researchers to study the economic value created by drivers using cellphones. In 2000, the researchers put that value at $43 billion. But in late 2002, based on an update to the findings, it was those researchers who estimated that distracted drivers using phones also caused 2,600 deaths each year and 570,000 accidents that caused injuries.

Similar findings piled up. In 2005, the federal published a bibliography of more than 150 scientific papers from the previous eight years about the dangers of cellphone use by drivers.

“It’s been a very consistent picture,” said Chris Monk, a researcher at the agency. “Frankly, I get a little annoyed that we continue to see studies that investigate the effects of cellphone use on driving, because they all show the same thing, whether you’re talking hands-free or not.”

Critics say the wireless carriers have sent mixed messages about the risks posed by drivers using cellphones.

The industry has resisted legislation to regulate cellphone use and, critics say, it has not warned drivers about dialing and talking as forcefully as it now warns them about texting.

Cellphone companies point out that for a decade they have run numerous public service ads, like AT&T’s 2001 “Be Sensible” campaign, telling customers not to talk while driving through bad weather or heavy traffic. On its Web site, Verizon Wireless cites government recommendations that the safest course is to stay off the phone while driving.

The CTIA ran its first distracted-driving campaign in 2000, with the tagline: “With Wireless, Safety Is Your Most Important Call.” Its latest slogan: “On the Road, Off the Phone.”

On its Web site, the CTIA offers safety tips including, “Do not engage in stressful or emotional conversations that might divert your attention from the road” and “Use a hands-free device for convenience and comfort.”

Those warnings do not acknowledge the many studies that show that hands-free devices do not eliminate risks. The industry says the research is inconclusive. One widely cited study, for example, shows that hands-free devices do limit the risk of talking while driving. However, that study, by the Transportation Institute, also showed that the act of dialing while driving poses serious risks.

Cellphone industry leaders also say studies have not shown a link between cellphone use and crashes. But little data exists on the number of crashes caused by drivers using cellphones because police either do not collect such data or started doing so only recently.

The industry says the number of reported accidents fell to six million in 2007 from 6.7 million a decade earlier — at the very time cellphone use has soared. Its critics say that the drop reflects the many safety improvements to vehicles and roads and that, besides, fatality rates have stayed fairly constant.

Ultimately, the industry has been motivated to educate customers because of good corporate citizenship, not because of research, said Mr. Largent, the head of the CTIA. “We don’t like to see our devices used in a way that puts drivers at risk,” he said.

The most aggressive education effort has come in recent months, focused on texting. “Texting or mobile device usage in a car is an issue on par with drunk driving itself,” said Daryl Evans, a vice president at AT&T, which has begun adding a sticker that reads “don’t text and drive” to the screens of nearly all new phones.

Verizon Wireless has put up billboards and is running television and radio spots. Last month, put out a news release urging customers not to text and drive and urging employees to agree not to do so. The CTIA has started a public service campaign to warn teenagers.

But why, critics ask, does the industry accept researchers’ findings on the dangers of texting when it found their studies lacking on the dangers of dialing or talking on the phone while driving?

“There’s probably little difference between making a phone call and texting,” Mr. Largent conceded. “If you have to take your eyes off the road, it can’t be a good thing.”

But he said the industry is not taking a position on whether states should ban dialing or talking while driving. “We’re not saying anything about that,” he said. “We’re going to let our consumers make their voices heard.”

For critics, it adds up to an effort by the industry over the years to appear responsible without hurting its core business. The companies’ warnings, critics argue, have not been loud enough to register (Over the last decade, the percentage of drivers talking on the phone at any given time has doubled, the government estimated).

“The landfill-sized accumulation of studies about the dangers of using these devices while driving should have prompted a much more engaged posture on the part of the industry to be leaders to attempt to rein in this behavior,” said James E. Katz, the director for the Center for Communications Studies at Rutgers.

Other critics go further. “The real message was: continue to use our product,” said Mr. Ditlow, from the Center for Auto Safety.

He and others say a legislative battle in shows that the industry’s actions speak louder than its words.

“I am at an absolute loss,” Joe Simitian said, standing at the podium, facing fellow members of a California Assembly subcommittee.

It was April 23, 2001, the day Mr. Simitian, Democrat of Palo Alto, submitted legislation to require California drivers to use hands-free devices.

Mr. Simitian could not understand why major cellphone companies opposed his legislation, even though their educational materials urged drivers to use hands-free devices.

He cited such materials published by AT&T, Cingular and Sprint — companies that opposed the bill. “When using your Sprint PCS phone in the car, focus on driving, not talking, and use your hands-free kit,” Mr. Simitian said, reading from Sprint’s own materials. “Failure to follow these instructions may lead to serious personal injury and possibly property damage.”

Mr. Simitian, who seized on the issue after seeing dangerous behavior on the roadways, told his colleagues the legislation merely sought to codify “the very practices this industry has been promoting for the last several years.”

Verizon Wireless was the first wireless company to testify. Breaking with the other major companies, as it often has on this issue, it supported Mr. Simitian. Its representative called the Simitian legislation necessary because education was not enough.

Representatives from AT&T, Sprint and Cingular said their education efforts were working. Their lobbyists added other concerns: research did not show cellphone use as a major cause of accidents; wireless phones should not be singled out from other kinds of distractions like eating; and mobile phones were essential emergency tools.

The representative from AT&T said the legislation did not adequately define “hands-free device.”

Mr. Simitian saw a contradiction. “These are the folks who wrote the brochure and now tell us they don’t know what a hands-free device is,” he said.

The legislation did not make it out of committee, a result Mr. Simitian attributed to heavy company lobbying. In each of the next five years, major wireless companies opposed the same proposal in California, saying education was sufficient.

Companies also said they were looking out for consumers. They argued, for instance, that a hands-free law would provide an excuse for police officers to pull over minority drivers. There is “the very real possibility it will lead to unfair and discriminatory consequences,” Sprint Nextel wrote in a letter opposing the 2006 bill.

But that version passed and the law took effect in 2008.

The industry’s position has since changed. In a recent interview, Mr. Largent conceded that the opposition in California was “a mistake.”

“At the time, we were all operating on the science that was before us and the evidence we had,” he said.

“The science at the time was the science that caused them to publish brochures telling people to use hands-free devices,” he said.

And Mr. Simitian says the industry had ample evidence at the time that its education efforts were not working.

Mr. Largent conceded recently that the industry’s education efforts were inadequate. He added that if people say, “ ‘That’s not your position 10 years ago,’ I say, ‘You’re right.’ This industry continues to evolve. We think it’s evolving in the right direction.”

The industry is evolving. It focuses less on marketing the car phone. But some ads promote a new generation of devices for cars.

A recent Sprint television ad shows a driver and four passengers in a car. The ad is for a mobile wireless service that allows people to use the Internet not just on phones but also computers. “Right now, five co-workers are working from the road using a ‘Mi-Fi,’ a mobile hotspot,” the voiceover says. One person is checking e-mail, another is streaming , a third is using Mapquest and two are downloading and revising a presentation, the voice says.

Sprint says that despite what the voiceover says, not all five co-workers are actually working. “Throughout this television commercial, the driver has both hands on the wheel. He is not engaging in any unsafe behavior and is focused on driving,” Sprint says. The company also says the product’s instructions warn about distracted driving.

And the newest phones let people do many tasks at once. A recent ad in People magazine for the Nuvifone, sold by AT&T, shows a woman, apparently in the lawn-ornament business, explaining how she got directions from her phone while making a work call.

“I just tapped the address and followed spoken, turn-by-turn directions right to the front door,” it reads. “And I was able to take the call about pink palm trees — while still navigating.”

Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T, said safety is paramount. “Your first priority in the car is driving safely,” he said. The marketing for the Nuvifone, he added, is “not intended to override our position.”
254 2009-12-07 THE American release of “Broken Embraces,” the new film by the Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, was heralded by an unexpected product: a limited-edition series of espresso cups that Mr. Almodóvar designed for Illycaffè, the Italian coffee company.

Each of the seven cups in the series is decorated with images that evoke one of his films, including “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “Volver” and “Broken Embraces,” which is from Sony Pictures Classics. But the marketing of the film, which opened in theaters last month and stars Penélope Cruz, has had little relation to the coffee cups.

“It’s not intentional to promote the film,” Illycaffè’s chief executive, Andrea Illy, said by telephone from Rome. He said, modestly, that the company did not “have the power to promote an Almodóvar film. It’s more probably the Almodóvar film that promotes Illy coffee.”

The partnership puts a new twist on the Happy Meal model of film marketing, with two powerful brands joined together to cross-promote their products, with some film marketing diverging into unexpected realms. This fall and winter, movie studios are running some creative promotions involving museum exhibits, video games and, yes, McDonald’s Happy Meals.

The Hollywood studios have long sought partners to help market their films, but as advertising and marketing budgets have been strained by the downturn and profits have sagged, they have grown even more eager to hitch their movies to potentially talked-about products, and vice versa. Happy Meals are tied to the recent animated film “Astro Boy,” but some less prominent and artier films have found an array of product tie-ins.

Aiming for blanket coverage, two films this season — “Where the Wild Things Are,” from Warner Brothers, and “The Twilight Saga: New Moon,” from Summit Entertainment — have teamed with multiple brands.
255 2009-12-07 The best-known museums in France, including the Musée d’Orsay and the Palace of Versailles, were open on Sunday after a four-day strike that disrupted about a dozen institutions and tourist sites. The strike began two weeks ago at the Pompidou Center, which remained closed on Sunday for a 13th day, and was called in response to a government plan to reduce the large state work force by replacing only one of every two workers who retire. The unions said this policy would devastate the Pompidou Center because 44 percent of its work force is due to retire in the next decade. On Friday two-thirds of the Louvre reopened, while the Musée d’Orsay went back into business on Sunday. “It’s just a pause in the conflict,” said Franck Guillaumet, who represents the major union at the Pompidou Center.
256 2009-12-07 High steel fences atop concrete barricades surround the center, and vehicles can enter only through well-armed police checkpoints. The southern reaches of the Inderhavnen Canal, which runs just west of the center, are embroidered with concertina wire to prevent access by water.

Germany and Sweden have contributed vehicles and bomb-sniffing dogs, and Denmark has received permission from the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to reintroduce border checkpoints should it be necessary.

On Thursday, the police set a car on fire as part of a demonstration of a newly acquired water cannon, which is also capable of dispersing crowds. Police officers from various parts of Denmark have been reassigned to Copenhagen, bringing the force here to around 6,500 officers.

In a reflection of security concerns, the police briefly restricted access to the Bella Center on Sunday as journalists arrived for a news conference. An officer who would not give his name said that the police were scrutinizing a suspicious object to make sure it was not a bomb. It turned out to be a suitcase filled with clothes.

Members of some human rights and environmental groups have said that the show of force could keep peaceful demonstrators at home.

“Obviously, the police have to be ready for whatever might occur,” said Lene Vennits, general secretary for People’s Climate Action, an umbrella organization representing dozens of Danish environmental and advocacy groups. “On the other hand, we think the rhetoric, with pictures of the new water cannon and the fires, is too much, and we are afraid that the ordinary Danish demonstrator will be frightened away.”

Demonstrations, like a march from the city center to the United Nations meeting place on Saturday, will be permitted by the police at pre-approved sites or along specified routes. More spontaneous gatherings will also be tolerated, although the police issued a statement banning open-air meetings that “may constitute a danger to the public order.”

The statement also stipulated that participants in public demonstrations “are not allowed to conceal their faces in whole or in part with a hood, a mask, paint or similar.”

Despite the rules, several organizations are promising to test Copenhagen’s definition of law and order. An organization called Climate Justice Action has announced plans to penetrate the Bella Center and “take over the conference for one day and transform it into a Peoples Assembly,” according to a statement on the group’s Web site.

A murkier organization called Never Trust A COP — a reference to the 15th Conference of the Parties, the official name of the United Nations meeting — promises on its Web site that members will “consciously attack the structures supporting the COP15” and “break through the lines of their police.”

Mr. Larsen said that his officers would have low tolerance for behavior that deviates from “Danish society as we prefer it to be.”

The police will be helped in that regard by new laws that allow them to arrest and hold people for up to 40 days for “hindering the police.” Other protesters deemed to be a problem can be held for 12 hours without formal charges.

Most short-term detainees will pass through the holding facility at the former Carlsberg beer depot, designed to process up to 1,000 people over a 24-hour period. Ida Thuesen, a spokeswoman for the human rights group Amnesty Denmark, called that plan inhumane.

“International standards require that people being arrested are not humiliated, that they should have room to lie down and sleep and go to the toilet,” she said. “These cages are not good enough.”

Mr. Larsen said that the holding pens, while not luxurious, was in keeping with all international conventions.

He emphasized that the police would allow people to express themselves peacefully, but those looking to stir discord on the streets or to commandeer the proceedings should think twice.

“If you listen to their announcements, they say they want to enter the Bella Center on the 16th to make a speech on the negotiation floor,” he said. “I can only say that they will not be able to enter the Bella Center.”

279 2009-12-08 North Korea made a rare appearance before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday, where it defended itself against accusations of abuses like public executions, torture and allowing its population to go hungry. One delegate said political prisoners did not exist in North Korea. Regarding public executions, a North Korean official said they occurred only “in very exceptional cases” and at the request of victim’s relatives. The North Korean ambassador, Ri Tcheul, said the nation’s food crisis had improved. “The issue of serious malnutrition is a thing of the past,” he told the 47-nation council. The United Nations estimates that 8.7 million people in North Korea need food.

The consulate said it was one of the largest cases of United States visa fraud ever. It did not say whether any victims received visas.
281 2009-12-08 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Dr. Ed Thompson, a nationally prominent health official in Mississippi who was credited with improving health statistics in the state after years of poor performance, died last Tuesday at his home in Ridgeland. He was 62.

He had cancer, his son Mark said in confirming the death.

In Dr. Thompson’s two terms as chief of the state’s Department of Health, Mississippi made significant strides against infant mortality, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. He served in the post from 1993 to 2002 and again in 2007.

During his first term, Mississippi had the highest immunization rates in the country, while its tuberculosis case rates fell below the national average for the first time in 30 years and its syphilis rates were below the national average for the first time since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began keeping records, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the State Board of Health.

After leaving Mississippi in 2002, Dr. Thompson worked at the C.D.C. in Atlanta, where he was chief of public heath practice and deputy director for public health services. He returned to Jackson in 2006 to serve on the faculty of the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

In 2007, he was again hired by Mississippi after Dr. Brian Amy was ousted as head of the Department of Health and lawmakers restructured the Board of Health.
282 2009-12-08 CULIACÁN, Mexico — The steady drumbeat of complaints against Mexico’s army is expected to continue Tuesday, when Amnesty International is scheduled to release a report raising allegations of extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions against soldiers engaged in the nation’s drug war.

The report, which meshes with earlier examinations by Human Rights Watch and Mexican human rights groups, accuses soldiers of torturing 25 police officers in Tijuana in March to coerce them to confess to links to organized crime. It says a man arrested by soldiers in October 2008 in Ciudad Juárez was found dead of a cerebral hemorrhage. It says two brothers from Ciudad Juárez were led away from soldiers the next month and never seen again.

In only one of the five cases raised by Amnesty did the army acknowledge some responsibility. It involved the deaths of three men detained by the army in Nuevo Laredo in March. The Ministry of Defense has detained 12 soldiers and charged them in connection with the men’s disappearance and deaths.

“Amnesty International recognizes the serious challenge to public security facing the Mexican government and its responsibility to protect the population and integrity of state institutions,” the report says. “The organization understands that law enforcement duties in such situations are difficult and dangerous for those charged with improving public security conditions. Nevertheless, crime cannot be fought with crime.”

The State Department in August issued a report saying that accusations of army abuses had risen sixfold in the two years since President Felipe Calderón’s offensive against drug cartels began in 2006. The report, however, concluded that Mexico was taking measures to address the problem and that American counternarcotics assistance should not be held back as a result of the allegations.
283 2009-12-08 Instead of holding occasional meetings like this to sign a global agreement, our leaders should meet more frequently to publicize the issues of emissions and climate change, and the achievements and failures of nations around the globe.

Change the focus from international agreements to local change, and let each nation’s industries, citizens and politicians battle out solutions. Make this a race among nations; do not hinder progress by tying all our legs together.

Some will progress more rapidly. There will not be parity, but there will be progress.

Ten years ago the world was holding its breath awaiting the devastating impact of the millennium bug. Though we had been assured by countless scientific experts that this was a huge problem, we now know that the global hysteria was almost entirely baseless.

It should not be a surprise that people have second thoughts about what scientific pundits tell them about global warming, particularly when this is attended by quasi-religious fervor and denigration of those who hold an opposing view.

What the e-mail messages hacked from British climate scientists show is that scientists, too, have human frailties and are capable of behaving in a partisan and even vindictive manner.

What they clearly do not show is anything that would alter the enormous preponderance of evidence that human-caused climate change is occurring.

Throughout 2009 I have read several articles in The Times reporting new data showing that conditions are worsening even faster than had been anticipated. There is accumulating evidence that we are losing ice sheets and glaciers faster, that sea levels have risen more and that global temperatures are rising faster than the models had predicted. Of course, these are the very consensus models that the global warming skeptics are now stridently attacking.

What the skeptics call Climategate is just another in the seemingly endless parade of phony conspiracy theories that attract attention because of their sizzle, not their substance.

Your editorial concludes, “It is also important not to let one set of purloined e-mail messages undermine the science and the clear case for action, in Washington and in Copenhagen.”

Hold on a minute. It was precisely because “one set” of opinions has been driving climate politics that the whistleblowers, not hackers, published the evidence. And it is precisely because of the type of coverage that The New York Times and other mainstream news organizations are giving the whistleblowing incident that the integrity of both the scientific and journalistic communities is being threatened.

Honest questions have been raised and honest attempts have been made to shed light on questionable claims about climate science for decades. We need to push for greater disclosure, more scrutiny, better research and a halt in the action before we jump into policy and regulatory schemes that we will deeply regret.

284 2009-12-08 Transportation officials say they will not need to fully close the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as they had expected to complete repairs to a cracked beam. A State Transportation Department spokesman, Bart Ney, said engineers were able to come up with a construction plan that would require the closing of only some bridge lanes at night. The project is supposed to provide a long-term fix to the crack on the bridge’s eastern span that was discovered over the Labor Day weekend.
285 2009-12-08 A judge has dismissed charges against Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki and an aide who were accused of misappropriating money from a college savings program. The judge, Valerie Adair of Clark County District Court, said that the four-count felony indictment alleged that the crimes occurred over five years but did not say which funds were used, which transactions were wrong and what duty Mr. Krolicki violated. Judge Adair’s ruling said the indictment of a Krolicki aide, Kathryn Besser, was also insufficient.
286 2009-12-08 Prosecutors said Mr. Colletta believed he was being threatened by the Bloods gang, which is identified with the color red. None of the shooting victims were Bloods, certainly not Mr. Leonik. This was a man who stood with the Solidarity trade union while living in Poland in the 1980s and immigrated to New York with his wife and two teenage daughters in 2002, hoping to prosper.

Instead, he is turning 50 with a bad leg, no job and no money, his American dream dashed.

Hs daughters are helping to support him, now that he can no longer work as a carpenter renovating Manhattan apartments. His wife developed a heart problem and moved back to Poland for health care.

Mr. Leonik’s leg has 15 long screws stabilizing it, and scars from knee to hip. He cannot climb stairs or lift heavy objects and at times, his leg is swollen and useless. A coming operation, his fourth, may help, he is told. He grits through the pain, refusing, he said, to waste money on painkillers.

More torturous is the notion that his fortunes nose-dived because of the color shirt he put on one quiet summer evening to walk the dog, he said.

“For a long time, I could not sleep because of the pain,” he said. “I’d think, ‘Why me? Why did this happen? How am I going to make it? I’ve become a burden to my family.’ ”

His small savings ran out quickly. Since he lacked proper immigration documentation, he had trouble receiving benefits.

“I was making good money and the whole world was open,” he said, with the help of an interpreter. “I was going to send my daughters to college and buy a house, but things turned out otherwise.”

Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, lent Mr. Leonik a hand by providing $919 to help with his phone and electric bills. And they provided an immigration counselor, Malgorzata Ulbrych-Luczynski, who has helped him apply for a visa that is available to certain crime victims.

Mr. Leonik recalled that when he fell from the gunshot, Sonia leapt onto his chest. The shooter sped off, but his face was seared into Mr. Leonik’s memory, and he later testified before a grand jury and identified Mr. Colletta from an array of photographs, helping prosecutors indict him on second-degree murder and other charges.

Mr. Colletta has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is likely to start early next year. There were long delays because he changed lawyers repeatedly, prosecutors said recently.

“I was unlucky, at the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said. “But I have a grandson now, my family and friends. I consider myself to be lucky except for this one incident.”

He still has the upper body of a power lifter, and he toys with small dumbbells in his living room. He minds his grandson, plays with Sonia and practices his music.

Picking up his guitar, he rigged his harmonica holder and began playing on them simultaneously: “Amazing Grace.”

He’ll get through this, he says, but no more red shirts. Yes, it sounds silly, he admitted, “but subconsciously, it stays with you.”
287 2009-12-08 We already knew that in addition to the many thousands who have been killed or physically wounded, hundreds of thousands have returned with very serious psychological wounds: deep depression, , and so on. Other problems are also widespread: alcohol and , family strife, homelessness.

The new study, by the RAND Corporation, was published in the journal Pediatrics. The children surveyed were found to have higher levels of emotional difficulties than their peers in the general population.

According to the study:

“Older youth and girls of all ages reported significantly more school, family and peer-related difficulties with parental deployment. Length of parental deployment and poorer non-deployed caregiver were significantly associated with a greater number of challenges for children, both during deployment and deployed parent reintegration.”

The air is filled with obsessive self-satisfied rhetoric about supporting the troops, giving them everything they need and not letting them down. But that rhetoric is as hollow as a jazzman’s drum because the overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire at all to share in the sacrifices that the service members and their families are making. Most Americans do not want to serve in the wars, do not want to give up their precious time to do volunteer work that would aid the nation’s warriors and their families, do not even want to fork over the that are needed to pay for the wars.

To say that this is a national disgrace is to wallow in the shallowest understatement. The nation will always give lip-service to support for the troops, but for the most part Americans do not really care about the men and women we so blithely ship off to war, and the families they leave behind.

The National Military Family Association, which commissioned the RAND study, has poignant comments from the children of military personnel on its Web site.

You can tell immediately how much more real the wars are to those youngsters than to most Americans:

“I hope it’s not him on the news getting hurt.”

“Most of my grades dropped because I was thinking about my dad, because my dad’s more important than school.”

“Mom will be in her room and we hear her crying.”

The reason it is so easy for the U.S. to declare wars, and to continue fighting year after year after year, is because so few Americans feel the actual pain of those wars. We’ve been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan longer than we fought in World Wars I and II combined. If voters had to choose right now between instituting a draft or exiting Afghanistan and Iraq, the troops would be out of those two countries in a heartbeat.

I don’t think our current way of waging war, which is pretty easy-breezy for most citizens, is what the architects of America had in mind. Here’s George Washington’s view, for example: “It must be laid down as a primary position and the basis of our system, that every citizen who enjoys the protection of a free government owes not only a proportion of his property, but even his personal service to the defense of it.”

What we are doing is indefensible and will ultimately exact a fearful price, and there will be absolutely no way for the U.S. to avoid paying it.
288 2009-12-08 Indeed, people inside the Treasury told me that the No. 1 reason offered by the firm during weeks of back-and-forth — even when it was discussed indirectly — was compensation. Bank of America was so desperate, in fact, that it diluted its own shareholders by selling new shares worth $18.8 billion to replace some of the funds it is returning.

Just read the notes from research analysts the day that Bank of America announced the $45 billion payment.

Virtually none of them focused on the idea that there was a sign of strength at the firm; instead they focused, as Morgan Stanley did, on how “it eliminates the competitive disadvantage relative to peers who had already repaid TARP.” External candidates may be “more likely to talk” now that the bank is no longer restricted by the pay czar.

That may be all well and good, but what about the health of the bank — and any continuing risks to the system? Wasn’t the purpose of the bailout program to put the financial system on a much steadier foundation? And wasn’t repayment supposed to be based, at least in part, on banks beginning to lend again?

Joseph Tibman, author of “The Murder of Lehman Brothers” noted on his blog that at Bank of America, its loans fell from $942 billion to $914 billion from the second to the third quarter. It also lost $1 billion in its third quarter. That’s not to say it isn’t healthier than it used to be — it’s all relative.

The rules for repayment seem to be squishy, and worse, are likely to create a two-tier system. While most of the biggest banks have been able to repay their bailout money — with the notable exceptions of Citigroup and Wells Fargo — many community banks, holding bad commercial real estate loans, are still carrying the taint of being obligated to the government.

They will likely now press to return the money as quickly as possible too, perhaps too quickly.

“Financial markets demand clarity and certainty,” said David Nason, a former Treasury staff member who created the Troubled Asset Relief Program under President George W. Bush, and who is now a managing director at Promontory Financial Group. “Until they have that, there will be a drumbeat of questions as to what TARP repayments mean for the strength of particular institutions and of the banking system in general.”

Just seven months ago, Treasury officials would have probably laughed if you told them banks would be rushing to repay. Remember those stress tests that had all of Wall Street stressed out for months about whether they’d pass and what it would all mean? By the way, what do all these repayments say about Treasury’s ability to make reliable forecasts? Just asking.

Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency that didn’t exactly cover itself with glory with its prognostications, recently wrote a remarkably candid research note that suggested the $45 billion repayment didn’t really matter, because if the bank got in trouble again, taxpayers would be there with another bailout.

“We consider BofA to be highly systemically important and therefore continue to believe that BofA would receive extraordinary government support if necessary,” it said. But, it added, “we do not believe such support will be needed.”

Let’s hope S.& P. is right this time around.
289 2009-12-08 In 1966, the laboratory took up residence in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains behind Stanford in an unfinished corporate research facility that had been intended for a telecommunications firm.

The atmosphere, however, was anything but button-down corporate. The antiwar movement and the counterculture were in full swing, and the lab reflected the widely disparate political views and turmoil of the time. Dr. McCarthy was a committed leftist who would gradually move to the right during the ’60s; Les Earnest, the laboratory’s deputy director, who had worked in government intelligence, would move to the left.

The graduate students soon discovered the building’s attic and took up residence there. Mr. Earnest found a clever way, known in the parlance of the A.I. community as a “hack,” to pay for a sauna in the basement of the building, and because many of the young researchers were devotees of Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings,” they created a special font in Elvish and used it to identify offices as places from Middle Earth.

The scientists and engineers who worked at the laboratory constitute an extraordinary Who’s Who in the computing world.

Dr. McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence in the 1950s. Before coming to SAIL he developed the LISP programming language and invented the time-sharing approach to computers. Mr. Earnest designed the first spell-checker and is rightly described as the father of social networking and blogging for his contribution of the finger command that made it possible to tell where the laboratory’s computer users were and what they were doing.

Among others, Raj Reddy and Hans Moravec went on to pioneer speech recognition and robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. Alan Kay brought his Dynabook portable computer concept first to Xerox PARC and later to Apple. Larry Tesler developed the philosophy of simplicity in computer interfaces that would come to define the look and functioning of the screens of modern Apple computers — what is called the graphical user interface, or G.U.I.

Don Knuth wrote the definitive texts on computer programming. Joel Pitts, a Stanford undergraduate, took a version of the Space War computer game and turned it into the first coin-operated video game — which was installed in the university’s student coffee house — months before Nolan Bushnell did the same with Atari. The Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Joshua Lederberg worked with Edward Feigenbaum, a computer scientist, on an early effort to apply artificial intelligence techniques to create software to act as a kind of medical expert.

John Chowning, a musicologist, referred to SAIL as a “Socratean abode.” He was invited to use the mainframe computer at the laboratory late at night when the demand was light, and his group went on to pioneer FM synthesis, a technique for creating sounds that transforms the quality, or timbre, of a simple waveform into a more complex sound. (The technique was discovered by Dr. Chowning at Stanford in 1973 and later licensed to Yamaha.)

The laboratory merged with the computer science department at Stanford in 1980, reopened in 2004, and is now enjoying a renaissance. Its trajectory can be seen in the progress made since 1970, when a graduate researcher programmed a robot to automatically follow a white line under controlled lighting conditions at eight-tenths mile per hour. Thirty-five years later, a team of artificial intelligence researchers at Stanford would equip a Volkswagen Touareg named Stanley with lasers, cameras and a cluster of powerful computers to drive autonomously for 131 miles over mountain roads in California at an average speed of 19.1 miles per hour to win $2 million in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge, a robotic vehicle contest.

“We are a first-class citizen right now with some of the strongest recent advances in the field,” said Sebastian Thrun, a roboticist who is the director of SAIL and was one of the leaders of the Stanley team.

The reunion also gave a hint of what is to come. During an afternoon symposium at the reunion, several of the current SAIL researchers showed a startling video called “Chaos” taken from the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter project. An exercise in machine learning, the video shows a model helicopter making a remarkable series of maneuvers that would not be possible by a human pilot. The demonstration is particular striking because the pilot system first learned from a human pilot and then was able to extend those skills.

But an artificial intelligence? It is still an open question. In 1978, Dr. McCarthy wrote, “human-level A.I. might require 1.7 Einsteins, 2 Maxwells, 5 Faradays and .3 Manhattan Projects.”
290 2009-12-08 WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal from a Christian student group that had been denied recognition by a public law school in California for excluding homosexuals and nonbelievers. The case pits anti-discrimination principles against religious freedom.

The group, the Christian Legal Society, says it welcomes all students to participate in its activities. But it does not allow students to become voting members or to assume leadership positions unless they affirm what the group calls orthodox Christian beliefs and disavow “unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.” Such a lifestyle, the group says, includes “sexual conduct outside of marriage between a man and a woman.”

The law school, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, part of the University of California, allows some 60 recognized student groups to use meeting space, bulletin boards and the like so long as they agree to a policy that forbids discrimination on various grounds, including religion and sexual orientation. The school withdrew recognition from the Christian group after it refused to comply with the policy.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled in favor of Hastings in March.

“Hastings imposes an open membership rule on all student groups — all groups must accept all comers as voting members even if those individuals disagree with the mission of the group,” a three-judge panel of the court said in a brief unsigned decision. “The conditions on recognition are therefore viewpoint neutral and reasonable.”
291 2009-12-08 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s revenue projections are suddenly running $200 million below what was expected, while the agency is coping with $143 million in cuts in state financing, agency officials said on Monday.

It was unclear what the darkening financial picture would mean for subway and bus passengers. A spokesman for the authority said that the chairman, Jay H. Walder, was not contemplating a fare increase for 2010.

The $200 million was to have come from a payroll tax for transit that was part of the authority’s rescue package, which the Legislature approved in May. On Monday, the agency’s chief financial officer, Gary Dellaverson, called the transit tax situation “a shocking development, both because of the magnitude of the underrun (about 20 percent) and the late date of its discovery.”

The authority’s board is scheduled to approve the final version of its 2010 budget next week. The authority is required to have a balanced budget.

Mr. Dellaverson, whose comments, made in an e-mail message to board members, were distributed by an agency spokesman, said the sudden shortfall “will make our budget adoption next week quite challenging.”
292 2009-12-08 In the beleaguered music industry’s latest bid to generate more money from its content, two top music labels on Tuesday will introduce Vevo, a Web site for music videos.

Vevo is co-owned by the Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and the Abu Dhabi Media Company. Vevo said Monday that it had signed up a third major music label, EMI Music, as a video provider, leaving only one holdout among the big four labels, Warner Music. Vevo said conversations with Warner were continuing.

Videos on Vevo will be hosted and streamed by YouTube, the video site owned by Google.

The site will come online in the United States and Canada on Tuesday evening.

“It will be a higher-quality experience around music and videos than anything else that’s currently out there,” Rio Caraeff, Vevo’s chief executive, said in an interview. Mr. Caraeff said the site would host 30,000 music videos by the end of the year. To underscore the exclusive nature of the Web site, Vevo will also carry original programs by artists for their fans.

The company, which was announced last spring, is similar in some ways to Hulu, the Web site for viewing television owned by a group of TV networks. Vevo will syndicate videos to an array of sites — including YouTube — and promote Vevo.com as a destination of its own.

“Vevo will work to restore the premium luster around music video inventory,” Mr. Caraeff said.

Music companies have licensed their videos to sites like YouTube for years, but have sought higher advertising rates and a greater share of the revenue.
293 2009-12-08 So far, the evidence of groundwater pollution is thin. Environmental groups contend that is because governments have been slow to react to the drilling boom and are not looking hard for contamination. Gas companies acknowledge the validity of some concerns, but they claim that their technology is fundamentally safe.

The debate is becoming more urgent as gas companies move closer to more populated areas, especially in the Northeast, where millions of people are likely to find themselves living near drilling operations in coming years.

“To be able to scale up our drilling, clearly we have to be in sync with people’s concerns about water,” said Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, a leading gas company. “It’s our biggest challenge.”

Hydraulic fracturing consists of injecting huge volumes of water at high pressure to break shale rocks and allow natural gas to flow out more easily. The water is mixed with sand, chemicals and gels to lubricate the process and help keep the rocks open.

After refining the technique in Western states in recent years, gas companies are moving to tap the nation’s largest shale structure, the Marcellus shale, which stretches from Virginia to New York.

“It’s a very reliable, safe, American source of energy,” said John Richels, president of the Devon Energy Corporation.

Environmental activists, however, say there is at least scattered evidence that fracturing operations can pose risks to groundwater sources, particularly when mistakes are made in drilling operations. They have also questioned how some companies deal with the wastewater produced by their operations, warning that liquids laced with chemicals and salt from drilling can overload public sewage treatment plants or pollute surface waters.

Deborah Goldberg, a lawyer for the nonprofit environmental group Earthjustice who is fighting to toughen Pennsylvania’s discharge rules, said the state “is facing enormous pressure from gas drillers, who are generating contaminated water faster than the state’s treatment plants can handle it.”

According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which is going through a public review of its new rules on hydraulic fracturing, gas companies use at least 260 types of chemicals, many of them toxic, like benzene. These chemicals tend to remain in the ground once the fracturing has been completed, raising fears about long-term contamination.

The most immediate hazard from the national drilling bonanza, it is clear, involves contamination of residential drinking water wells by natural gas. In Bainbridge, Ohio, an improperly drilled well contaminated groundwater in 2007, including the water source for the township’s police station, according to a complaint filed this year. After building to high pressures, gas migrated through underground faults, and blew up one house.

Here in Dimock, about 30 miles north of Scranton, Pa., 13 water wells, including that of Ms. Switzer, were contaminated by natural gas. One of the wells blew up.

Under prodding, environmental regulators are stepping up the search for groundwater contamination. In Pavilion, Wyo., for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun an investigation into contamination of several drinking water wells.

Luke Chavez, an E.P.A. investigator, said that traces of methane and 2-butoxyethanol phosphate, a foaming agent, had been found in several wells near an area where the EnCana Corporation, a Canadian gas company, had used hydraulic fracturing in recent years.

He said the compounds could have come from cleaning products or oil and gas production, but “it tells us something is happening here that shouldn’t be here.”

An EnCana spokesman, Doug Hock, said the company was “committed to working with E.P.A. to resolve this issue.” But he added, “At this point, no specific connection has been made between the tentatively identified compounds and oil and gas activities.”

In a 2004 study, the E.P.A. decided that hydraulic fracturing was essentially harmless. Critics said the analysis was politically motivated, but it was cited the following year when the Republican-led Congress removed hydraulic fracturing from any regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

The current Democratic Congress recently enacted a law requiring the E.P.A. to review the study. Lawmakers from Colorado and New York have also introduced legislation to end the water act exemption and require gas companies to disclose all chemicals used in fracturing operations.

The agency has begun an analysis of whether hydraulic fracturing requires tighter federal regulation.

“E.P.A. is reviewing available information to determine whether hydraulic fracturing fluids have contaminated drinking water and has dedicated resources to properly studying this issue,” the agency said in a statement.

The political situation has put the gas companies on the defensive. “It’s not going to stop us, but we do have to solve the problem in a prudent manner,” said Rodney L. Waller, a senior vice president at the Range Resources Corporation, a major gas producer in the Marcellus shale.

Partly in response to opposition it has encountered in New York, Chesapeake recently indicated that it would not drill in the New York City watershed, a region that supplies drinking water to nearly 10 million people. Schlumberger, a service company that performs fracturing operations on behalf of gas companies, said it was working on “green” fracturing fluids, including safer substitutes for hazardous chemicals.

In the Barnett shale gas field in Texas, Devon Energy and Chesapeake are trying various treatment techniques for disposing of contaminated drilling water. Gas executives hope that wider use of such techniques will damp public opposition in some regions. Several companies are starting a joint water treatment effort in Pennsylvania in the next few weeks.

Still, around Dimock, the gas boom is viewed with mixed feelings. Many public officials support drilling. Governor Edward G. Rendell has called the surge “a great boon” to Pennsylvania. Many people have leased their land here and are collecting royalty checks from gas production.

The hills around Dimock have been bulldozed to clear the ground for dozens of drilling pads the size of football fields. Eighteen-wheelers thunder down narrow country roads, kicking up dust and fumes. Recently, a helicopter buzzed overhead while dangling heavy cables used for seismic tests.

In September, the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation, a Houston energy company, was required to suspend its fracturing operations for three weeks after causing three spills in the course of nine days. Cabot, which was fined $56,650 by the state, said the spills consisted mainly of water, with only 0.5 percent chemicals. This month, Cabot was fined an additional $120,000 by Pennsylvania for the contamination of homeowners’ wells. It must now submit strict drilling plans to the state.

A company spokesman, Kenneth S. Komoroski, said it was too early to blame hydraulic fracturing — the technology at the heart of the boom — for pollution of water wells. He said Cabot was still investigating the causes of last January’s contamination incidents.

“None of the issues in Dimock have anything to do with hydraulic fracturing,” he said.

The fines were little consolation to Ms. Switzer, the woman who can no longer draw drinking water from her well.

After moving here in 2005, she sold drilling rights on her property for a mere $180 after, as she recalled it, a gas company representative convinced her only one well might be drilled. In fact, no well was drilled, but three were on surrounding properties. Her well was contaminated at the beginning of the year after gas leaked from a well drilled by Cabot.

Her family now uses bottled water supplied by Cabot every week. She fears that if she tried to sell her home, which sits in the middle of a drilling zone, no one would buy it.

“Can you imagine the ad? ‘Beautiful new home. Bring your own water,’ ” Ms. Switzer said. “We’re like a dead zone here.”
294 2009-12-08 The new assessment of the $700 billion bailout program, provided by two Treasury officials on Sunday ahead of a report to Congress on Monday, is vastly improved from the Obama administration’s estimates last summer of $341 billion in potential losses from the TARP program. That figure anticipated more financial troubles requiring intervention.

The officials said the government could ultimately lose $100 billion more from the bailout program on new loans to banks, aid to troubled homeowners and credit to small businesses.

Still, the new estimates would lower the administration’s deficit forecast for this fiscal year, which began in October, to about $1.3 trillion, from $1.5 trillion.

The report could tamp down some of the public anger directed against both political parties over the bailouts. Congressional leaders are already planning to use some of the program’s money for economic stimulus and job creation.

Of course, the government’s potential losses extend beyond the Treasury program. The Federal Reserve, for example, still holds an immense portfolio of mortgage-backed securities whose market value is unknown.

The improved picture of the Treasury program is the result of higher-than-expected returns on the loans and the fact that, as the financial sector has recovered from its free fall last year, the government has not had to use much more of its $700 billion in lending authority this year, according to the Treasury officials, who declined to be identified as discussing the report before it was presented to Congress.

Last week, Bank of America became the latest big bank to say that it was raising private capital and would soon repay its $45 billion bailout loan. Once that payment is made, Citigroup will be the last big bank tethered to the state.

The estimated $42 billion in losses is a net figure that accounts for some profits to offset the losses. The Treasury officials said the government had lost about $60 billion, roughly half to Chrysler and General Motors and the other half to the insurance giant American International Group.

But the government is projecting a $19 billion profit and perhaps more on the $245 billion lent to banks, through interest, dividends and the sale of warrants the government received as collateral.

Aside from the rare good news for the federal deficit, the latest bailout accounting could have political and legislative ramifications.

Politically, the Treasury program has been unpopular ever since it was created in October 2008 by former President George W. Bush and a Congress controlled by Democrats. It has grown only more reviled over time as a symbol for many Americans of the government’s perceived favoritism toward Wall Street, which is making money, over Main Street, which continues to struggle and shed jobs.

An anti-Washington anger is disturbing both parties as they approach a midterm election year, and some Republican lawmakers have drawn primary opponents largely because of their votes last year in favor of the bailout program.

It was unclear how that climate might be altered as taxpayers realize they did not actually lose $700 billion to help big banks. At most, the Treasury officials said, the ultimate losses will be one-fifth of that amount and probably less.

Democrats in Congress have already decided to divert about $70 billion from what is left in the bailout fund to the cost of additional road-building and other construction projects, credit to small businesses and further aid to state and local governments.

The administration had wanted to dedicate unspent bailout money to the deficit but signaled to Congressional leaders late last week that it would not oppose their plans. Mr. Obama is expected to touch on those ideas and others in an economic speech.

The bailout program is due to expire at the end of the year, but the Treasury has indicated it will use the authority it was granted by Congress to extend it into 2010.

The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, testified last week to a Senate committee that “nothing would make me happier than to end this as quickly as possible,” but he added, “we’re not quite there yet.”

Mr. Geithner, who has become the administration’s lightning rod for anger among both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, said “there are parts of the system that are still very damaged” — in banking, housing, commercial real estate and credit-starved small businesses.

He said the administration would propose within weeks when and how to end the program safely.

At that hearing, he hinted at the Treasury’s improved forecast for the program, saying “we’re going to be able to return very, very substantial amounts of money to address the critical economic needs, long-term fiscal needs, of this country.”

That prediction contrasts with the administration’s planning soon after Mr. Obama took office in January. Fearing that additional bank failures could exhaust the entire $700 billion fund, they proposed up to $500 billion more in federal lending authority in the administration’s first budget in February.

Instead, just $7 billion more in bailout money has gone out to banks since Mr. Obama became president, making a second loan authorization unnecessary. Meanwhile, banks have raised 16 times as much, $114 billion, in private capital, according to the Treasury.

Since the Treasury subjected big banks to “stress tests” last winter to determine how much private capital they must raise to withstand future financial shocks, the financial institutions have been eager to do so, in order to repay the government and thereby exit the Treasury’s rescue program — not least to escape the restrictions on executive compensation that come with it.

Mr. Geithner now says that banks will repay $175 billion by the end of next year. To date, counting Bank of America’s promised payment, banks have repaid $116 billion, according to the Treasury. Also, in coming weeks the Treasury will sell more of the government’s bank warrants to investors.
295 2009-12-08 Some less-affluent victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme could receive extra help from a change in the tax code, under a proposal submitted Monday by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.

The plan would make indirect investors — those who invested through so-called feeder funds — eligible for tax breaks for theft and fraud losses that are already available to direct Madoff investors; allow for faster, larger contributions to tax-free retirement accounts to make up for the losses incurred; and allow for penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement accounts for those in dire need because of their fraud losses.

Senator Schumer said the proposals were aimed at establishing a fairer tax treatment for those indirect investors, who tend to have a lower net worth than victims who invested directly with Mr. Madoff.

“That so many of the smaller investors, who may not have even known they were investing with Madoff, are not receiving the same assistance as direct investors is simply unfair,” Mr. Schumer said.

The Internal Revenue Service issued rules in April allowing direct investors to treat their Madoff losses as net operating losses, as if the individual investors were small businesses. That allowed them to “carry back” their losses for five years, instead of for three, and to carry any remaining losses forward for up to 20 years.
296 2009-12-08 THE FACTS Hypertension has been linked to heart disease, diabetes and early mortality. But hair loss?

Scientists are not exactly sure why, but a number of studies have suggested a relationship between blood pressure and men’s baldness, particularly the early-onset kind.

In a study published in 2007, for example, researchers looked at 250 men ages 35 to 65. After controlling for age, high cholesterol, smoking and other variables, they found that hypertension was “strongly associated” with male pattern baldness: those with a blood pressure reading above 120 over 80 had twice the risk of the others.

Other studies have suggested a link between baldness and heart disease. For a 2000 study in The Archives of Internal Medicine, for example, researchers analyzed health records for 22,000 male doctors over 11 years, examining many aspects of their health. Men with mild balding of the crown had a 23 percent higher risk for heart disease, and those whose crowns were completely bald had a 36 percent greater risk.

But the relationship is only a correlation. Researchers suspect hair loss could be among many markers of an increased risk of hypertension, caused in part by higher levels of testosterone and other hormones, and more androgen receptors in the scalp.

Studies suggest that hair loss may indicate an increased risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.
297 2009-12-08 COPENHAGEN  A much-anticipated global meeting of nearly 200 nations  all seeking what has so far been elusive common ground on the issue of climate change  began here on Monday with an impassioned airing of what leaders here called the political and moral imperatives at hand.

“The clock has ticked down to zero,” said the United Nations’ climate chief, Yvo de Boer. “After two years of negotiation, the time has come to deliver.”

From now until Dec. 18, delegates will try to hammer out some of the most vexing details involved in the pursuit of a global climate accord.

While the critical action will unfold much later in the process, when higher-level ministers and, ultimately, heads of state arrive, the opening day of the conference was an opportunity for the United Nations to nurture a sense of mission and for delegates to begin staking out their positions.

Among the most difficult hurdles, many participants acknowledged throughout the day, are achieving adequate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions  particularly from big polluters like the United States and China.

So, too, are securing commitments from wealthy nations to deliver what could ultimately be hundreds of billions of dollars in financing to poor countries, which argue that they are ill equipped to deal with a problem they did little to create.

Several countries announced new emissions goals in the days leading up to the meeting, including China, Brazil, the United States, India and South Africa  although many participants have noted that the targets are far too low to keep rising temperatures in check in coming decades.

The pledges so far are “not going to get us as far we need to go, to really stay within the two-degree limit,” said Koko Warner, an observer with the United Nations University in Bonn, Germany. He was referring to scientists’ recommendations that temperature increases be capped at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

“We don’t want to admit it, because the consequences are so bad,” she said.

Still, speakers at the conference’s opening plenary session  which began with a video appeal from children across the world to save them from what looked like an apocalyptic future of deserts and rising seas  were clearly aiming to spur negotiators forward.

After several hundred delegates and observers settled inside the main conference hall of the Bella Center to music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish Girls Choir, Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister presiding over the conference, noted the recent string of emissions commitments by various countries.

“Every positive announcement will improve our chances of staying below the two degrees Celsius target,” she said. “But as we all know only too well, we are not there yet.”

“This goes for financing as well,” Ms. Hedegaard said, noting that arriving at a consensus on that issue “may be an even bigger challenge” than emissions cuts.

Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, spoke before delegates of the urgent need for action. And, alluding to a recent controversy over e-mail messages between scientists hacked from a university computer server, he had pointed remarks for those who “find it difficult to accept” climate change science.

Climate change skeptics have argued that the e-mail shows that the evidence for global warming is less unequivocal than scientists assert.

But Dr. Pachauri ticked off a list of trends that robustly reflect the warming of the global climate. “Internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including the individuals singled out in these e-mail messages,” he said.

Both inside and outside the plenary session, the mood among negotiators and other participants was one of cautious optimism. Alden Meyer, who directs climate policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he was encouraged that the meeting appeared to have nudged previously reluctant nations to begin offering up emissions cuts.

“It has focused attention and gotten all the major players to put their initial offers on the table,” Mr. Meyer said. “I think that’s good news.”

Still, negotiators who have spent the last year working out the technical details of a potential treaty are now coming up hard against political pressures at much higher levels that will ultimately shape any agreement.

The challenge, Mr. Meyer said, will be getting parties to “rise above the politics as usual” that threatens to bog down the process.

Jonathan Pershing, the State Department’s special climate envoy, who represented the United States at the opening plenary, said he saw strong signs that the conference would prove critical in getting traction on curbing emissions and helping poor countries that are urgently threatened by climate change  particularly given the decision by more than 100 leaders, including President Obama, to attend.

He said he saw no indication that efforts could be blunted by Saudi Arabia and other countries that have cited the e-mail flap in challenging climate findings.
298 2009-12-08 Residents of the Southeast are so much more likely than other Americans to die of a stroke that epidemiologists call the region the “stroke belt.” A new study suggests that the risk may be established early in life, because even when those born in the South relocate to another region as adults, they carry the increased risk of stroke with them.

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health who analyzed stroke deaths in the United States found that people who were born in the Southeast and continued to live there as adults were 34 percent more likely than other Americans to die of a stroke in the year 2000. But even those who moved away faced an increased risk, with whites 20 percent and blacks 9 percent more likely to die of a stroke than Americans who never lived in the region, the study found.

The study, published in the Dec. 1 issue of the journal Neurology, analyzed death rates from 1980, 1990 and 2000. Though stroke death rates declined, the study found consistent patterns of elevated risk through the decades.

“This is a real mystery,” said M. Maria Glymour, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. Although the increased risk is very small on an individual level, she said, “We don’t know exactly what is going on that’s affecting people so broadly.”

318 2009-12-09 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg needs his passport again — but this time, it’s for official business.

The mayor’s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Bloomberg and some of his top aides would attend the United Nations conference on climate change in Copenhagen next Monday and Tuesday. His schedule, for now, includes delivering a speech at a reception for mayors and other delegates, and attending another reception for 100 mayors from around the world who are taking steps locally to address climate change.

New York is one of 10 cities (Los Angeles is the only other American one) to have been selected for an interactive exhibition called “Future City,” highlighting local initiatives. The city will outline its attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in buildings under a plan that the City Council was expected to approve on Wednesday, said Jason Post, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg.

Mr. Bloomberg was expected to be accompanied on the Copenhagen trip — which he will pay for, as he has for previous trips — by Rohit T. Aggarwala, director of the mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability; Deputy Mayor Kevin Sheekey; and Stu Loeser, the mayor’s press secretary. Others may go as well, but “we haven’t finalized the itinerary or the roster yet,” Mr. Post said.

It was not clear, for instance, whether the city’s new environmental commissioner — Caswell F. Holloway IV, a top City Hall aide with a thin environmental résumé — would go. Nor was it known whether the first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris, would join them.

The trip gives the mayor a chance to spotlight his environmental record, which has been praised by former Vice President Al Gore and the U2 frontman Bono, among others.
319 2009-12-09 “Let the Great World Spin” is “one of the most electric, profound novels I have read in years,” Jonathan Mahler wrote in the Sunday Book Review. Apparently, he wasn’t alone in his assessment. Colum McCann’s book about New York in the ’70s went on to win this year’s National Book Award. Tonight the Irish writer and creative writing professor at Hunter will read from the novel, which “also works as an allegory about resilience and recovery after Sept. 11, 2001,” at 192 Books at 7 p.m.
320 2009-12-09 WASHINGTON  If negotiators reach an accord at the climate talks in Copenhagen it will entail profound shifts in energy production, dislocations in how and where people live, sweeping changes in agriculture and forestry and the creation of complex new markets in global warming pollution credits.

So what is all this going to cost?

The short answer is trillions of dollars over the next few decades. It is a significant sum but a relatively small fraction of the world’s total economic output. In energy infrastructure alone, the transformational ambitions that delegates to the United Nations climate change conference are expected to set in the coming days will cost more than $10 trillion in additional investment from 2010 to 2030, according to a new estimate from the International Energy Agency.

As scary as that number sounds, the agency said that the costs would ramp up relatively slowly and be largely offset by economic benefits in new jobs, improved lives, more secure energy supplies and a reduced danger of climate catastrophe. Most of the investment will come from private rather than public funds, the agency contends.

“People often ask about the costs,” said Kevin Parker, the global head of Deutsche Bank Asset Management, who tracks climate policy for the bank. “But the figures people tend to cite don’t take into account conservation and efficiency measures that are easily available. And they don’t look at the cost of inaction, which is the extinction of the human race. Period.”

Whatever global warming’s effects  and most scientific projections are less dire  there are also varying estimates of the economic costs of failing to act to address the problem soon, some of them very high.

In Copenhagen, some of the most intense and difficult discussions for negotiators center on any potential agreement’s near-term financial arrangements. Some of the poorest and most vulnerable nations are calling for a gigantic transfer of wealth from the industrialized world to island nations and countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are most likely to feel the ravages of a changing climate.

Many poor nations are insisting that wealthier nations make deeper cuts in their emissions and contribute more money to help the poorer countries, a split that widened in Copenhagen on Tuesday as competing documents of a potential agreement circulated.

Over time, some of the hundreds of billions of dollars the poorer countries are demanding will begin to flow, as global carbon markets become established and governments in rich countries begin to open the spigot of public spending.

But in the meantime, the industrialized countries have proposed a relatively modest fund of about $10 billion a year for each of the next three or four years to help poorer countries adapt. Even that effort remains the subject of conflict over which countries should contribute how much, what body should oversee the spending and how to determine which projects qualify for finance.

President Obama’s spokesman said last week that the president supported a short-term fund to aid developing nations and that the United States would pay “its fair share.” In many multilateral efforts, the United States picks up a quarter to a third of the tab.

“Providing this assistance,” the White House statement said, “is not only a humanitarian imperative  it’s an investment in our common security, as no climate change accord can succeed if it does not help all countries reduce their emissions.”

The money would be used to help developing nations reduce emissions by switching to renewable energy sources like wind and solar and by compensating landowners for not cutting down or burning forests, a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Other funds might be used to adjust to effects of a changing climate, like rising sea levels, by building flood walls or relocating settlements to higher ground.

Mr. Obama will travel to Copenhagen on Dec. 18 to attend the final day of the meeting, a sign that the White House believes that a far-reaching accord, including deals on some of the sticky financial issues, is possible.

“This is the question that is being posed in Copenhagen,” said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. “How much money do the developed countries have to put on the table to bring developing countries into the conversation?”

Mr. Stavins said that the bulk of the money would have to come from private investment because, he said, it was “inconceivable” that the governments of the wealthy countries would come up with adequate financing and also because private entities spent money much more efficiently.

The climate and energy legislation passed by the House in June sets aside roughly $8 billion a year for assistance to developing countries by 2030, Mr. Stavins said. That figure, he suggested, represents the upper limit of public financial support from the United States.

The perspective from the developing world is, not surprisingly, somewhat different.
321 2009-12-09 Christopher J. Christie, the Republican governor-elect of New Jersey, has attended 122 Bruce Springsteen concerts and wanted nothing more than to have the Boss appear at his inauguration. Mr. Christie’s brother, Todd, a stock trader, sent a message through an intermediary to Jon Landau, Mr. Springsteen’s manager, saying that he would make a gift to a charity of the singer’s choosing if Mr. Springsteen performed.

As a fallback, Todd Christie suggested arranging a benefit concert in the week leading up to the Jan. 19 inaugural, to put a little distance between the events if that would make Mr. Springsteen, a diehard Democrat, more comfortable.

But word came back that, while Mr. Springsteen had performed for the Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and John Kerry, “he doesn’t want to get involved in state politics,” Todd Christie said.

The intermediary, he said, was Jerold Zaro, a friend of the governor-elect’s and another loyal Springsteen fan.

Mr. Zaro, diplomatically, stressed that the rejection had been polite: Mr. Springsteen, he said he was told, “was well aware that the governor-elect is a fan and wishes him every success, because needless to say, he’s a loyal and devoted citizen of New Jersey.”

Taking no offense, Mr. Christie arranged instead to bring in the B Street Band, a long-running Springsteen tribute band, which plays at events ranging from bar mitzvahs and birthdays to arena shows, not to mention the governor-elect’s election-night party.

324 2009-12-09 “Is it the end of an era?” Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS, asked. “Sort of. Only the special soaps are going to survive. It’s certainly the end of the client-owned soap.” He added, “All good things come to an end, whether it’s after 72 years or 54 years or 10 years. It’s a different time and a different business.”

“As the World Turns” had the longest-running continuing character in television history — the family matriarch Nancy Hughes, played by Helen Wagner, now 91. Despite the conservative reputation of many Procter & Gamble soaps, the show featured a male couple, Noah and Luke, and the first gay kiss on daytime television.

However, its audience, which exceeded six million viewers a week in the 1990s, has drawn less than 2.5 million so far this season, the Nielsen Company said. And the younger adult women viewers, which are favored by most advertisers, had shrunk even more.

The decline has been a continuing trend for the daytime genre. One CBS soap, “The Young and the Restless,” has posted slight gains of 3 percent total viewers and 6 percent among women 18 to 49. NBC’s last remaining soap, “Days of Our Lives,” has staged a small comeback this season. It is up 15 percent among total viewers and 10 percent among women 18 to 49.

But for the most part soaps these days are watched by older women. Every network soap now has a median viewer age over 50 and only “General Hospital” on ABC is under 53. “As the World Turns” has a median age of 57.8. That is older than most of the network averages in prime time, during which NBC’s programs have a median age of 48, ABC’s programs 51.4 and CBS’s programs 54.1.

The subtraction of the two shows means that network television, which once offered soap operas back to back throughout the daytime hours, will be down to only six serial dramas on three networks starting next fall.

For Procter & Gamble the loss is symbolic more than financial. The company, which has owned more than 20 soap operas in the past 80 years, now spends more than $7 billion in global advertising each year, making soap operas only a tiny portion of its business. Procter & Gamble said on Tuesday that it wanted to remain in the television production business and that its annual “People’s Choice Awards” will continue each year.

“The world has turned,” said Tim Brooks, a television historian and co-author of “The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows.” Ratings for soap operas have declined for decades because of “social changes,” he said.

“Women are working today,” he said, and fewer people are able to spend time every day watching soap operas.

The shows emerged on the radio in the 1930s during the Depression, he said, “and they seem to be ending in an era of economic downturn, too.”
325 2009-12-09 Mr. Obama proposed several new ideas, saying he would hash out the details with Congress, which is working on parallel tracks on its own proposals. Final action will not occur until early next year. House leaders have given up their plans to pass a jobs bill this month.

The president’s new proposals include eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investment and creating “cash for caulkers” rebates for consumers who invest in home-weatherization projects — an idea modeled on the popular “cash for clunkers” program that increased auto sales over the summer.

Most of Mr. Obama’s proposals, however, expanded on the original stimulus package, which was intended to work over several years and was passed when 700,000 jobs a month were being lost. The economy lost 11,000 jobs last month.

The elimination of capital gains taxes would expand on a break in the stimulus law, which let small businesses exclude 75 percent of gains from taxes.

Mr. Obama also would extend through 2010 a break allowing small businesses to immediately write off as much as $250,000 in qualified investments, and a second break allowing small and large businesses to deduct more capital expenses upfront.

With small businesses complaining that they cannot get bank loans, Mr. Obama proposed to eliminate fees and increase government guarantees in 2010 for loans from the Small Business Administration. He said the Treasury would step up loans to small businesses from the bank bailout fund, the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

“There has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP,” Mr. Obama said, acknowledging widespread populist anger over the program. But “as galling as the assistance to banks may have been,” he added, it “indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system.”

This week the Treasury Department released projections that taxpayers would get back most of the $700 billion budgeted for the program. Mr. Obama said the resulting savings could lower the deficit and “shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs on Main Street.”

He proposed to increase by an unspecified amount the spending in the stimulus law for rebuilding highways, railroads, airports and water projects. He also is seeking $50 billion to leverage public and private investments to finance infrastructure projects.

Mr. Obama said he wanted more subsidies for green jobs. The administration received far more qualified applications, particularly from makers of wind turbines and solar panels, than it had money to give, he said.

Besides money to create jobs, the president and Congress want to extend emergency unemployment benefits that otherwise will expire at the end of the year.

That relief would cost roughly $100 billion. Last month, Congress spent about $30 billion on unemployment benefits, a popular tax credit for home buyers and business tax breaks. According to available estimates, the sort of proposals that Mr. Obama and Congress are considering could easily exceed $100 billion more, depending on the details.

Searching for ways to reduce deficits once the economy recovers, the leaders of the Senate Budget Committee are expected on Wednesday to announce an agreement for a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts and revenue increases.

Officials said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, and Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, would propose an 18-member bipartisan commission to make recommendations on which Congress could vote after the 2010 elections.

The lawmakers want Congress to consider the proposal this month when it must vote on increasing the debt limit. But some leading Democrats in Congress and the White House are opposed.

Do not cut all the way to top of slice; bread should remain attached there. Tuck half the cheese and onion slices in pocket. Repeat with other slice.

2. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Pour custard into a wide, shallow dish. Soak stuffed bread in custard, turning once halfway through, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 minutes.

3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half the apple slices in a single layer and cook for 1 minute. Place bread slices in pan, covering apples. Arrange remaining apple slices on top of bread; cook 1 minute more.

4. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Uncover and increase heat to medium; cook until bottoms are golden, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn bread and apples and cook until bread is golden and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve topped with fried eggs if desired.

349 2009-12-10 The only company executive indicted in the nation’s largest workplace raid on illegal immigrants pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy. The executive, Jose Humberto Gonzalez, pleaded guilty to knowingly hiring illegal immigrants at Howard Industries, where he was personnel director. Prosecutors would not discuss details of the plea agreement. More than 600 immigrants were arrested in a raid in August 2008 at a Howard plant in southern Mississippi. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said that Mr. Gonzalez was placed on leave after his indictment in May and resigned Wednesday after entering his plea. The company said it had always had “a strict policy to hire only U.S. citizens or those who have legal authorization to work in the United States” and has since instituted even more safeguards, including a fingerprint identification system for its employees.
350 2009-12-10 David Gelbaum, a wealthy investor in clean technology, confirmed on Wednesday that, because of financial constraints, he had been forced to sharply reduce his donations to the American Civil Liberties Union and two other organizations.

Mr. Gelbaum, an intensely private philanthropist who has long insisted on anonymity in exchange for his gifts, said in a statement that he had made more than $380 million in donations over the last four years to the A.C.L.U. and two other organizations, the Sierra Club and the Iraq-Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund of the California Community Foundation.

“I am willing to be publicly named now because my investments in alternative, clean energy companies have placed me in a highly illiquid position as a result of the general credit crisis in the American and world financial systems,” Mr. Gelbaum said.

He issued the statement after an article in The New York Times on Wednesday described how the loss of his annual donation of more than $20 million would cause further cost-cutting at the A.C.L.U. “The shift in my financial circumstances is the cause of the reduction in giving, and not any disapproval or dissatisfaction with the programs,” Mr. Gelbaum said in his statement. “To the contrary, I hope they will thrive with the generous support of many other donors, large and small.”

Over the last four years, Mr. Gelbaum gave $246.6 million to the fund set up by the California Community Foundation to support nonprofit groups offering assistance to the families of troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The foundation said he was the sole contributor to the fund. A statement on the foundation’s Web site says, “In the spring of 2009, all of the IADIF funds were allocated, and further applications for funding are not being accepted.”

The A.C.L.U. received $93.5 million over the same period, and the Sierra Club $47.7 million, Mr. Gelbaum said in his statement.
351 2009-12-10 YANGON, Myanmar (Reuters) — Myanmar’s ruling junta on Wednesday dismissed conciliatory moves by the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as insincere and dishonest.

Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi asked to meet the junta leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, in a Nov. 11 letter. In a Sept. 25 letter, she stated her desire to work with Western countries and the junta toward the lifting of sanctions. A commentary in the state-run New Light of Myanmar said her letters “are designed to tarnish the image of the ruling government.”
352 2009-12-10 In addition to challenging its critics, the government has used national security laws and court hearings to stall and limit an investigation of the prisoner transfers by the Military Police Complaints Commission.

At a special parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, General Natynczyk echoed the government’s argument that there was no credible evidence showing that even a single prisoner had been abused after being placed in Afghan custody. But during a hastily convened news conference on Wednesday, the general withdrew that claim because of a field report from 2006 that he said he had received that morning.

The report describes the circumstances surrounding the arrest of a man suspected of being a member of the Taliban. In one of the selected passages read by General Natynczyk, an unidentified Canadian officer wrote that once the man was detained by Canadian troops, “we then photographed the individual prior to handing him over to ensure that if the Afghan National Police did assault him, as has happened in the past, that we would have a visual record of his condition.”

The man’s case had emerged earlier in the Canadian political debate when it became known that the Canadian military removed him from Afghan police custody after he was severely beaten. But until Wednesday, General Natynczyk and the government said that the man had been arrested by the Afghan military, not Canadian troops. The field report clearly showed that the man was transferred by the Canadian military, the general told reporters.

The prisoner transfer issue flared up last month after a Canadian diplomat who had been in Afghanistan told the parliamentary committee that he had repeatedly warned the government in 2006 and 2007 that detainees were likely to be tortured their transfers. He said that those warnings had been ignored and that he had been told by a senior official to stop putting them in writing.

Mr. MacKay and others in the government dismissed the warnings from the diplomat, Richard Colvin, as not credible and suggested that they were based on propaganda from the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Classified government e-mail messages obtained by The Globe and Mail, however, show that Mr. Colvin acted on information he obtained from the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, was careful on Wednesday not to criticize General Natynczyk or the military, but he said that the reversal underscored the need for an inquiry.

“The issue here is trust,” Mr. Ignatieff told the House of Commons. “We can’t trust this government, we can’t trust a word that comes out of the mouth of this minister.”

By coincidence, Mr. MacKay was previously scheduled to testify before the parliamentary committee on Afghanistan on Wednesday afternoon.

During that session, Mr. MacKay rejected suggestions from opposition members that General Natynczyk’s correction was at odds with the government’s earlier claims.

Ujjal Dosanjh, the defense critic for the Liberals, said that the minister had “allowed prisoners to face a substantial risk of torture.” Mr. MacKay, clearly angry, dismissed Mr. Dosanjh’s remarks as “false, inflammatory and insulting allegations.”
353 2009-12-10 “That depends on how rapidly, obviously, they can generate more revenue,” he said. “But certainly it is going to be years before they can handle the bulk of the security tasks and allow the bulk of our troopers to redeploy.”

This was General Petraeus’s first appearance before Congress to defend the new Afghanistan policy, and he referred several times to his experience in Iraq, where he was the architect of the so-called surge.

“Achieving progress in Afghanistan will be hard, and the progress there will likely be slower in developing than was the progress in Iraq,” General Petraeus said. But, he insisted, “Afghanistan is no more hopeless than Iraq was when I took command there in February 2007.”

The general testified with the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, Jacob J. Lew, who helps direct the civilian effort in Afghanistan, and the American ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry. Ambassador Eikenberry, a retired lieutenant general, testified on Tuesday with the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal.

The two diplomats defended the administration’s development efforts in Afghanistan, saying they would hold Mr. Karzai to his promises to crack down on corruption by steering aid to ministries or district officials with a proven record of good conduct.

But Mr. Lew, under tough questioning by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, conceded that there were limits to the ability of the United States to change the behavior of Mr. Karzai or other leaders. “Holding them accountable does not mean that a year from now or five years from now there will be zero corruption in Afghanistan,” Mr. Lew said.

The committee’s chairman, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, pressed General Petraeus and Mr. Lew about how the United States planned to develop closer links to the Pakistani military and government.

“What happens in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border, will do more to determine the outcome in Afghanistan than any increase in troops or shift in strategy,” he said.

But none of the three offered many concrete examples of how the administration could exercise leverage over the Pakistani military or government.

General Petraeus acknowledged that pouring more troops into Afghanistan would raise the risk of driving more militants across the border into Pakistan, where they could further destabilize that country.

“That is why we’re working very hard to coordinate our operations more effectively with our Pakistani partners, so that they know what our operational campaign plan is, and can anticipate and be there with a catcher’s mitt, or an anvil, whatever it may be, to greet these individuals,” he said.

Mr. Lew laid out an extensive program of civilian assistance, including earthquake relief aid and efforts to strengthen the Pakistani electrical grid. He also said the United States wanted to forge closer ties with provincial officials, something it had not done adequately in the past.

It was left to General Petraeus to answer a blunt question from Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut: Is Pakistan’s embattled president, Asif Ali Zardari, in danger of being forced from office?

“I don’t see the prospect or the desire for anyone to change civilian rule,” the general said.
354 2009-12-10 WASHINGTON  As diplomats might say of a meeting between rivals that is just short of undiplomatic, President Obama and Congressional Republican leaders had a full and frank discussion at the White House on Wednesday when they met to discuss how to create more jobs.

The 90-minute session, while described by both sides as cordial over all, was a bit testy at times. Mr. Obama and the Republicans aired their philosophical differences over whether the government should keep spending money for stimulus measures to spur employers to hire, as Democrats favor and the Republicans oppose.

The meeting came on a day when the House voted to extend $31 billion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals, while the Treasury secretary announced an extension of the bailout program for banks, small businesses and troubled mortgage-holders.

According to Republicans’ reconstruction of the session, Mr. Obama started it.

In opening remarks, they said, the president, who campaigned on a pledge of bipartisanship, suggested that Republicans, by their refusal to work with him, “seem to be almost rooting against recovery” and for high unemployment in an effort to make gains against Democrats in the midterm elections next year.

Minutes later, the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, handed Mr. Obama a letter and a copy of what the House minority calls its no-cost jobs plan calling for no tax increases, new trade agreements and fewer regulations. (Mr. Obama had already read it, and later said he disagreed with some ideas and would talk with Republicans about others.)

Then Mr. Boehner shot back at Mr. Obama. “Mr. President, we do a lot of politics in this town but we are committed to working together in areas where we agree to get the American people back to work,” he said.

Administration aides did not dispute the Republicans’ account, but said the meeting was never confrontational and in fact was a constructive exchange of views.

“I think politics has clearly played a role” in their united opposition to the economic recovery plan, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told reporters afterward.

Mr. Gibbs added that the president’s main proposals this week  for business tax breaks and infrastructure projects have typically received bipartisan support in Congress.

Mark Zandi, the economist who formerly advised Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama’s Republican rival in the 2008 election, has vouched for the effectiveness of the stimulus policies, Mr. Gibbs added.

Republican lawmakers said they told Mr. Obama that his ambitious agenda of changes in health care, financial regulation and energy policies was unnerving many employers and causing “a hiring freeze,” as Mr. Boehner put it.

When Representative Dave Camp, a Republican from Michigan, called it “a job-killing agenda,” the president complained that Republicans were “trying to scare the American people” about his proposals. More than once, he challenged them to produce an economist who shares their idea that the government should cut spending before the economy has fully recovered. “We will address deficits next year,” he said.

Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said he did not see the president’s opening remarks or others as unduly political.

“He went around the table and everyone who was there got to say their piece,” said Mr. Gregg, who initially accepted a cabinet post but decided to remain in the Senate, where he has often been critical of the administration.

“A couple people made fairly strong statements,” he added, “and the president responded in a very cordial and thoughtful way.”

The president’s pique at Republicans was evident before Wednesday’s meeting, after 10 months in which they have opposed all of his major initiatives to address the problems he inherited. In his speech on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution outlining his latest economic recovery plans, Mr. Obama reviewed administration actions, said they had helped rekindle growth, and said that Republicans had basically stayed on the sidelines.

“We were forced to take those steps largely without the help of an opposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided over the decision-making that had led to the crisis, decided to hand it over to others to solve,” he said in his address.

Despite persistent high unemployment, the president and his aides lately have been buoyed by nonpartisan assessments that administration policies  chiefly the stimulus plan and the financial bailout program  are working, if not so well as originally advertised.

An independent five-member panel that Congress created to oversee the $700 billion bailout program issued a year-end report on Wednesday. It concluded that despite lingering problems, the program “can be credited with stopping an economic panic.”

Also on Wednesday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told Congress that he was extending the Troubled Asset Relief Program beyond its Dec. 31 expiration date, until Oct. 3. The law that created the program in 2008, at the end of the Bush administration during the worst days of the financial free fall, empowered the Treasury secretary to extend it if needed.

“We want to see the capital base of our financial system return to private hands as quickly as possible,” Mr. Geithner wrote to Congressional leaders. But, he said, “History suggests that exiting prematurely from policies designed to contain a financial crisis can significantly prolong an economic downturn.”

Mr. Geithner said the Treasury probably would not make more loans to banks, barring another crisis. Instead, he said, the program would be used to help troubled community banks, small businesses and homeowners.

Mr. Geithner also signaled to Congress that it could rescind up to $150 billion of the $700 billion lending authority, for “savings” to offset the costs of the emerging jobs bill. He wrote that Treasury did not expect to lend more than $550 billion ultimately.
355 2009-12-10 Citigroup executives and federal regulators are also discussing whether to let the bank out of a government insurance policy that guarantees almost $301 billion of Citigroup’s most troubled assets. Citigroup paid for that insurance selling preferred stock to the government. It is unclear how Citigroup would disentangle itself from that policy.

No final decisions have been made and the talks remain fluid. If Citigroup does not reach an agreement with its regulators in the next few days, however, it would be difficult to undertake a stock sale before mid-January, given that many investors will soon depart for the holidays. The bank also could run into disclosure issues if it released new information ahead of its first-quarter results.

While Citigroup executives have been discussing a payback plan with its regulators for months, they stepped up their efforts late last week after Bank of America was approved to repay its relief money.

Over the last few days, Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup’s chief executive, has been trying to win permission from federal regulators to repay its remaining $20 billion in relief funds by selling new stock, according to the people briefed on the talks. The government, which provided $45 billion in taxpayer relief, converted $25 billion of its investment into common stock earlier this year. That gave it a one-third ownership stake.

At first, Treasury Department and some Federal Reserve officials appeared willing to let Citigroup repay the government as long as the company raised enough money to at least partially offset the $20 billion. Officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who have a frosty relationship with Citigroup executives and deeper financial exposure, had been demanding that Citigroup raise more than that.

It is unclear if Citigroup would be required to raise money by selling additional businesses or assets — one of the terms of the Bank of America’s deal to repay the relief funds. Any new stock would dilute the value of Citigroup’s existing share, a prospect that has caused their value to tumble this week. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment late Wednesday. Officials from the Treasury, F.D.I.C. and the Federal Reserve declined to comment, too.

Citigroup executives are under pressure to cut a deal that will satisfy all of the bank’s regulators, and tension is running high inside the company’s Park Avenue headquarters.

The stakes are huge. While much of Wall Street is recovering, Citigroup remains plagued by rising losses in its consumer lending business and could face additional strain if does not get some relief from regulators when it moves billions of off-balance-sheet assets back onto its books by the end of this month.

Bank executives fear they could lose dozens of talented bankers and traders without a repayment plan in place before bonuses are paid early next year. Citigroup also faces an additional hurdle as the only relief recipient, aside from GMAC Financial Services, to convert government-issued shares into common stock.

Any effort by Citigroup to get out from under the government’s thumb will probably require the Treasury to begin selling those 7.7 billion shares in the company. That is a complex multistep transaction that is unlikely to happen before the end of this year.
356 2009-12-10 CIT’s emergence from bankruptcy underscores the recovery in the financial markets and the broader financial industry. Its reorganization plan, a months-long affair orchestrated during many late nights and hours of conference calls, relies on money from private investors, with virtually no aid from regulators.

It also proved that a financial firm could survive the challenges of bankruptcy court, which many financial analysts thought unlikely. “It’s an enormous achievement to have gotten the vote that you’ve gotten,” Allan L. Gropper, the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing CIT’s case, said this week in approving the reorganization plan.

Still, taxpayers’ investment in CIT was wiped out by the bankruptcy, in the first realized loss in the government’s $700 billion financial rescue plan. Banking analysts say other losses may follow.

And Jeffrey M. Peek, CIT’s chief executive and the architect of its ill-fated expansion, intends to step down at year-end, as the company cedes control to its creditors. CIT has hired executive search firms to find his successor and new board members.

Over the last five months, Mr. Peek and his management team, together with their advisers, sweated through negotiations with creditors and lenders to come up with a survival plan. More than a half-dozen executives involved in those negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the talks, retraced how the company nearly died before scraping together a rescue.

Since becoming a bank holding company last December, CIT believed that it could reform itself through access to government programs available to other financial firms, including the issuing of debt backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But a brief phone call to Mr. Peek on July 14 from William L. Rutledge of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, denying federal assistance, took company executives by surprise — and sent them scrambling.

Senior executives, who had assured clients that CIT would receive government aid, had to go back to companies like Dunkin’ Donuts, asking them how much money they needed today versus waiting a day, a week or more. In CIT’s boardroom in Midtown Manhattan, advisers kept a daily tally of the company’s dwindling cash levels on a whiteboard.

With $1 billion in bonds maturing in August, CIT and its advisers approached several banks about receiving a $3 billion loan, and by late Thursday, July 16, believed they had secured financing from a group led by JPMorgan Chase. But the next day, JPMorgan informed the company that it did not have enough time to conduct proper due diligence and would not risk making a loan so close to an imminent bankruptcy filing.

Jeffrey Aronson, a co-founder of Centerbridge Partners, an investment firm with a big position in CIT’s debt, later met with Mr. Peek and suggested that a group of about six large bondholders would be willing to supply an emergency loan.

As CIT’s troubles grew, its major bondholders warmed to the idea of a prepackaged bankruptcy, a specific type of Chapter 11 filing that usually takes no more than two months in court and would give the company breathing room on its debt load and bond maturities. If enough bondholders supported the so-called prepack, company officials reasoned, CIT’s troubles could be solved much more quickly and elegantly.

Treasury officials had expressed concern about what would happen to the government’s investment in CIT, since the preferred stock it held would almost certainly be wiped out in a bankruptcy filing. But the officials decided to stand down from a fight, opting instead to act like a normal investor. The result was a large debt-for-equity exchange offer, coupled with a solicitation of votes for a prepackaged bankrtupcy.

Yet CIT officials and advisers were still consumed by a dozen other issues, including negotiating with Goldman Sachs over preserving a $2.13 billion loan made in 2008, which carried a more attractive interest rate than the company could get at that time. Only the intercession of the CIT bondholder committee helped Goldman and the company to reach a deal.

By Oct. 26, CIT had appeased the concerns of major bondholders and rebuffed a challenge by Carl C. Icahn, who had acquired about $2 billion of CIT bonds.

358 2009-12-10 They are still looking. Backed by investors, they have reviewed 100 potential deals in a range of businesses — from breeding laboratory animals to gambling software — negotiated with the owners of 10 and are in advanced discussions with two.

“It’s just a question of finding a fit,” Mr. Burckmyer said.

Thomas Watson, co-founder of Asset Management International in Seattle, which tracks companies’ assets, says sales next year will probably be the same as this year’s, $1 million, which is one-fourth his projection of 18 months ago. But his company is profitable, he said, has a promising product in the works and is winning customers like United Airlines. “Considering this economy, we’re happy,” he said.

Similarly, since she started her Sweet Bites Bakery and Café in West Acton, Mass., two years ago, Caitlin Adler has gone from dreamer to obsessive numbers cruncher to hopeful pragmatist.

In December 2007, Ms. Adler was predicting an increase in sales to $12,000 a week from $7,000 within months. She was soon scaling back her projections and dealing with unexpected expenses.

Unlike many restaurant start-ups, though, Ms. Adler’s bakery has weathered the recession and built a loyal customer base. Sales have grown to about $9,000 a week, she said, and Sweet Bites is making enough money for Ms. Adler to end her financial dependence on her parents and start paying herself a full salary next year.

“More people may be on a tighter budget these days, but if you need your daily caffeine fix, you probably won’t give this up,” she said.

Other entrepreneurs find themselves at a turning point. Six months ago, Ted Ray, an acupuncturist and founder of Ted’s Tinctures in Mountain View, Calif., began searching for $750,000 in angel financing. His chances were good, he thought, because he had an actual product on the market, an herbal remedy called FlyRight Jet Lag Formula, with projected sales of $75,000 this year.

After making pitches to numerous investors, Mr. Ray said, he is in serious talks with two. If he gets the capital, he predicted that revenues would leap and “I’ll go into profitability late next year.”

Two years ago, Kathleen Diamond’s interpreting service, Language Learning Enterprise in Alexandria, Va., was experiencing explosive growth. She said it was acquired last month by CyraCom International of Tucson for an undisclosed sum. She has joined the company as a vice president.

A few business owners have foundered. In September 2008, Christopher Hazlett described how he switched the focus of his software design firm, Integrate Consulting in Hoboken, N.J., to small organizations after several corporations abandoned him. “I think it’s going to go,” he declared.

It did not. In August, he closed up shop. Upbeat to the end, he said that failure led to a dream job at an online distributor of music. “I get to do pretty much everything I loved when I ran a small company,” he said.

Robert Weitz has had a harder time. Three years ago, a wealthy cousin offered to finance any business he wanted to go into, but after a year of looking into businesses including a soccer academy and a spa, he came up dry.

Today, he is working at a Honda dealership in his native Mexico.

Some small businesses are thriving in the recession. Peter George, chief executive and part owner of Fidelis Security Systems in Boston, which provides protection against data breaches, said an increase in threats by hackers and laid-off employees has enlarged the market for his company’s services. Bookings this year have increased by 72 percent, he said, to more than $7 million.

“Fidelis is enjoying the fruits of its early years of focus on this market,” he said.

Other entrepreneurs are stepping back. Donna Young, for example, has returned to her first love, corporate management.

Ms. Young, a native of the Bahamas, still supplies garments to the upscale clothing store she started there with her sister not long after she moved to Epping, N.H., in 2003. But in August, she got an executive position at a Macy’s in nearby Manchester and found herself on familiar ground.

In the Bahamas, Ms. Young had been a human relations officer at the luxury Atlantis resort. At Macy’s, she said, she has the same decision-making responsibilities she used to enjoy. “Plus, I can get better deals with my employee discount,” she said.

Danny Kessler, who has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has switched not just careers but continents. Two years ago, Mr. Kessler was holding seminars on self defense for women in the United States. Today, he is teaching conversational English in South Korea. “I have always wanted to live abroad,” he said.

Similarly, Ben Casnocha, who founded a software company at age 14 and wrote the book “My Start-Up Life” two years ago at 19, is “traveling around the world, studying Spanish, contemplating a move to Latin America and thinking about starting a new business, yet unknown.”

But first prize goes to Ernie Doud Jr., co-founder and president of Doud Hausner & Associates, a consulting firm in Glendale, Calif. He, too, is on a voyage of self-discovery, which for him means semiretirement.

Mr. Doud, 67, and his wife, Maggie, own a hilltop lot in Florence, Ore., “with an almost 360 degree view that includes the Siuslaw River where it meets the Pacific, the ocean itself and the hills and forests,” he said. The couple will move to Florence next June to oversee the construction of their dream home.

“How wonderful it will be to have time to hold hands, walk on the beach and hike in the trees,” Mr. Doud said.
359 2009-12-10 DETROIT — The Labor Department said Wednesday that it would let the Ford Motor Company use stock instead of cash to pay some of the $13.1 billion that it owed to a new retiree health care fund, pending a period of public comment.

The department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration said it had proposed granting Ford an exemption to federal pension law. Ford said that it needed the exemption so that it could move ahead with an agreement reached this year with the United Automobile Workers union that allowed Ford to substitute stock for up to half of its obligations to a union-managed health care fund.

Health care coverage for about 285,000 Ford retirees and their dependents, along with some active workers will shift on Jan. 1 from Ford to the fund, known as a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA. The fund, created by Ford’s 2007 contract with the U.A.W., is expected to help Ford eliminate billions of dollars in future liabilities.

General Motors and Chrysler have also created retiree health care funds that take effect next month.

After the recession left all three automakers running short on cash, they persuaded the U.A.W. to let them substitute company stock for some of their debts to the funds.

After this year’s bankruptcies, 55 percent of Chrysler and 17.5 percent of G.M. are owned by their respective VEBA funds. Ford did not file for bankruptcy protection and remains a public company.

Ford’s shares are now worth more than five times their value in February, when the U.A.W. agreed that it would accept stock for some VEBA payments. The automaker owes an initial payment of $1.9 billion to the retiree fund at the end of the month, with up to $600 million of that amount payable in stock.
360 2009-12-10 On Sunday, the last day of the Fall North American Championships in San Diego, the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams was won by Nick Nickell and Zia Mahmood of New York; Ralph Katz of Hinsdale, Ill.; Bob Hamman of Dallas; Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla.; and Eric Rodwell of Clearwater Beach, Fla. They also won last year. (Richard Freeman, who died in June, was replaced this year by Katz.) Second, more than three boards behind, were Michal Kwiecien and Rafal Jagniewski from Poland, and Josef Piekarek and Alexander Smirnov from Germany.

The Keohane North American Swiss Teams was won by Carolyn Lynch of Scottsdale, Ariz.; Mike Passell of Las Vegas; Cezary Balicki and Adam Zmudzinski from Poland; and Andrei Gromov and Aleksander Dubinin from Russia.

Hamman (South) read the cards well in the diagramed deal to win the point on the board.

In the other room, Meckstroth (West) opened one no-trump, 14 to 16 points; North passed; and Rodwell (East) transferred into spades. After West rebid two spades, North surprisingly bid two no-trump for the minors instead of making the takeout double. South bid three clubs, which ended the auction. He won nine tricks for plus 110.

Hamman called his auction with Zia “ugly,” but it reached a higher-scoring major-suit contract. If Hamman made two spades exactly, the board would be a tie, but if he could collect an overtrick, his team would win the board.

West led the heart king, which declarer ducked, and continued with a second heart. Hamman won with his ace and cashed three club tricks. Then South ruffed a heart in his hand and led a diamond. West went up with his ace and returned a diamond, dummy’s king dropping East’s queen to give this position:

Based on the bidding and play, Hamman now knew that West had exactly two spades, which had to include at least one honor to give him opening points.

Hamman led dummy’s last club, East ruffing. Now declarer made the critical play of discarding his remaining diamond. He then won East’s trump lead with his ace and played another spade. Hamman took the last two tricks with his ten-eight of trumps over East’s nine-seven.
361 2009-12-10 Independent agents, also known as brokers, offer the greatest choice because they typically represent many carriers. They are paid on commission by the insurance company, between 10 percent and 20 percent of the annual premium depending on the policy. Beware: because some carriers pay a higher commission than others, brokers may be tempted to play favorites.

Captive agents represent one insurance company that pays them a salary and commands their loyalty. Some companies such as Allstate only deal with their own agents; that means you can only buy their policies through one of their agents.

Both independent and captive agents receive bonuses at the end of the year based on their ratio of policies sold to damages paid. That means it’s in their interest to sell you as much insurance as possible and minimize your claims as much as possible.

Understand, also, that most agents focus solely on insurance. “Sometimes there are solutions to your problem that might be better treated without insurance,” said Arthur Flitner, a small-business expert at the Insurance Institute of America. In some cases, for example, it makes more financial sense to self-insure against certain property risks by setting up a rainy-day fund, or to minimize lawsuit risks by enforcing strict employment policies.

That’s when a risk consultant can help. Because they’re costly — you’ll usually pay a few thousand dollars for a basic project — it makes sense to hire a risk expert only if you have an unusually risky operation, or run a business with more than, say, $25 million in revenue or more than 100 employees.

After you’ve found some trustworthy vendors, it’s time to shop for bids. Go to as many brokers and agents as you like, but keep in mind that insurance companies won’t bid on the same account through different brokers.

If you’re grossing less than $3 million, you will most likely end up with a business owners policy, known as a B.O.P., which bundles business policies and lets you add additional pieces as necessary. Every carrier assembles its B.O.P. differently, so make sure you’re making accurate comparisons when shopping.

If you are grossing more than $3 million, you will probably have to buy your policies separately. There are four policies you really can’t do business without if you have more than a couple of employees:

Workers’ compensation is required by state law and covers workers’ medical expenses, disability pay and death benefits. Rates vary widely by industry and occupation. While the premiums for a secretary might be 22 cents per $100 of payroll, the rate for a roofer might exceed $20 per $100 of payroll. Make sure your business is classified correctly, and don’t try to pass off your toy factory (manufacturing is considered high-risk) as a design firm (low risk). Once employees start filing claims, carriers will conclude that you are a riskier-than-usual design firm and raise your premiums.

Property insurance covers your physical premises as well as equipment in your office. Rates vary widely, depending on the age of your building, how far it is from the fire department, and whether it is made of steel or wood.

Tom Minkler, president of the Clark-Mortenson insurance agency in Keene, N.H., recommends obtaining insurance estimates before making any major business decisions. “A lot of our clients find out when they move from one location to another that their insurance costs change significantly,” Mr. Minkler said. “By then it’s too late.”

Beware of coinsurance clauses, which allow carriers to pay only a share of damages if they believe you underinsured your property. Instead, ask your broker to add “agreed value” coverage in which you and the insurance company agree on an appropriate insurance level. This can add up to 15 percent to your premiums, but it leaves less room for dispute later.

General liability insurance covers injuries your company causes to other people’s health, property or reputation. Rates usually take into account factors like revenue, size of your offices and number of customers. Most basic packages cover $1 million for each occurrence; umbrella policies can add more coverage quite cheaply.

If it’s available, make sure you buy the more expensive “occurrence” policy, which covers you for accidents at the time they occurred — even if you have since left the business and your policy has lapsed — as opposed to a “claims made” policy, which covers you only if you are insured when the claim is made.

Business interruption insurance — the kind Ms. Melchionda should have had — pays not just the lost sales and rent and payroll costs while you rebuild your business after an accident; it also pays for you to rent a temporary office or equipment so you can get back on your feet faster. “The cost of adding it is often negligible,” said Donna Childs, a risk expert and author of “Prepare for the Worst, Plan for the Best” (Wiley, 2008). “It’s difficult to justify not getting it.” But beware: some policies don’t go into effect until a certain amount of time has passed after an accident, so make sure to read the fine print.

These policies are just the first building blocks of your insurance coverage. There are dozens of other policies you could add, depending on the kind of business you run. Some, like medical malpractice for doctors and hospitals, are absolutely essential, while others are pure waste. To determine what you need, start by asking yourself two questions: how likely is it that you’ll sustain damage, and could you cover the cost of the damage yourself? As experts like to point out, insurance is meant to cover catastrophes, not pay for maintenance.

“It’s a gamble,” said George Von York, a public adjuster who helps business owners negotiate higher claims payments from insurers. “Most people will never have a substantial claim in their life. But boy, when you need it, it’s good to have that coverage.”
362 2009-12-10 GUANGZHOU, China — Auto sales are so strong in China that an unusual conspiracy theory has circulated on Western stock markets this month: the Chinese government must be secretly buying hundreds of thousands of cars and parking them somewhere.

The main evidence presented for the theory is that the number of gallons of gasoline consumed in China has been flat this year. But auto executives and Chinese buyers deny the rumor, which has spread so widely that economists have begun producing reports on why it is implausible.

Kevin Wale, the president of General Motors China, said that automakers knew who was buying their cars and saw no evidence of a car-buying conspiracy. Sharp improvements in fuel economy — partly because of government mandates and partly because of a shift to smaller cars — help explain the slow growth in gasoline sales, he said.

A series of recent increases in regulated fuel prices may have also discouraged some driving, he added.

In interviews over the last three weeks in Kunming in southwestern China, in Nantong in east-central China and here in Guangzhou in southeastern China, residents complained of cars being sold out at dealerships because many people wanted to buy as incomes rose, loans became available and extensive new highways opened.
363 2009-12-10 Among China’s 1.3 billion people, rising incomes are finally making large numbers of Chinese prosperous enough to make big-ticket purchases.

The question is: will they keep spending? The Beijing government is increasing consumption with rebates, subsidies and heavy bank lending. Whether China can turn the spending spree into the seeds of a true consumer society matters not just to China, but to the world.

For years, the West has pushed China to increase domestic consumption and reduce its dependence on exports — that’s because its overdependence on exports has distorted global trade.

To keep its export machine humming, China kept its currency undervalued to make its goods more competitive in foreign markets. The county beggared its own citizens, keeping salaries and bank deposit interest rates artificially low to support exporters.

China’s trade surpluses and extensive intervention in currency markets have led it to amass $2.27 trillion in reserves, mainly in United States Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities and other dollar-denominated investments, helping to keep interest rates low and finance Americans’ borrowing. Chinese parsimony enabled American profligacy.

If the Chinese buy more and Americans save more, a more stable global economic exchange can take shape. In the meantime, China’s rapid consumption growth is good news for the whole world. For the first time, China, not the United States, is a locomotive helping to pull the global economy out of a slump. But China’s tiny appetite for American exports means that the main benefit has gone to commodity exporters and to businesses in China.

Automakers are on track to sell 12.8 million cars and light trucks in China this year, virtually all of them made in China (although many are foreign brands), compared with 10.3 million in the United States. Appliance manufacturers expect to sell 185 million refrigerators, washing machines and other pieces of kitchen and laundry equipment in China this year, compared with 137 million in the American market.

In desktop computers, China moved solidly ahead of the United States in the third quarter, buying 7.2 million compared with 6.6 million in the United States.

Retail sales are growing 17 percent a year in China after adjusting for inflation, almost twice as fast as the overall economy.

Americans have been cutting back on purchases of everything from shoes to furniture to jewelry. But Chinese households are crossing a series of income thresholds at which cars and other big-ticket purchases become affordable.

At the same time, Chinese banks are stepping up consumer lending. The proportion of car sales financed with loans has doubled this year, to nearly 25 percent, although most Chinese still head for dealerships with bricks of 100-renminbi notes, each note worth about $14.62. Credit card spending rose 40 percent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, yet China still has just one credit card for every eight people, compared to two credit cards for each American man, woman and child.

While it is spreading creature comforts, China’s lending-based prosperity may also be sowing the seeds of future economic problems. China’s Banking Regulatory Commission recently told banks to show restraint in lending for the rest of the year, fearful that some of this year’s loans could become bad debts in the next several years, as happened with the mortgage lending spree in the United States.

The regulator threatened to block banks’ overseas investments and branch openings unless they can demonstrate adequate capital to cover risks.

The size of China’s consumer market, notwithstanding its growth, will make it hard for China to rescue the world economy by itself. Total consumer spending in China is still less than a sixth of American consumer spending at current prices and exchange rates. That is mainly because China has relatively few restaurants, hotels and other service businesses, even as sales of manufactured goods have risen.

The average price tags on most Chinese products are much lower than in Western markets. For many products, including some in which China leads in the sheer number of goods, the total dollar value of sales in China is still smaller than in the United States.

The average new car sells for $17,000 in China compared with almost $30,000 in the United States, according to J.D. Power. This is because Chinese consumers buy more subcompacts and fewer sport utility vehicles. While the Chinese market is one-quarter larger in the number of cars sold, the American market is still about two-thirds larger in dollar terms.

Similarly, the United States market for household appliances is a third larger in dollars, even though the Chinese market is a third larger in the number of appliances. Cooking ranges in China are sold for countertop installation without a lot of other equipment, for example.

“You don’t have the cook-a-turkey-in-the-oven type of product in China, because we don’t have that kind of cooking,” said Philip S. Carmichael, the president of Asian operations at Haier, China’s biggest appliance manufacturer.

But in some sectors, Chinese buyers are already proving more lavish than Americans. The average flat-panel television sold in China is bigger than in the United States, according to AU Optronics of Taiwan, the world’s third-largest manufacturer of flat-panel televisions.

When car sales began surging early this year, many auto executives attributed the boom to government incentives. To stimulate the economy, the government has offered rebates for rural families to buy cars and household appliances, and has cut sales taxes on cars with small engines.

But the boom has broadened to categories that barely qualify for incentives.

S.U.V. sales rose 72 percent in October from a year earlier. At Nissan, sales of cars with larger engines that do not qualify for the sales tax reduction are growing even faster than sales of small-engine cars.

Auto sales jumped 42 percent in the first 11 months of this year compared with sales in the same period last year. And sales are still accelerating, soaring 96 percent in November compared with the same month a year ago. Auto sales in the United States plunged 37 percent last month on the same basis.

China’s consumers have the potential to buy even more in the years ahead. The savings rate is close to 40 percent — and will remain high unless and until Beijing creates a social safety net for things like health care or retirement, which would encourage Chinese to spend more today.

And though annual incomes still average just $2,775 a person in cities and $840 in rural areas, Western economists predict the economy will grow almost 12 percent in each of the next two years and the renminbi is widely expected to appreciate someday, further increasing consumers’ buying power.
364 2009-12-10 The tradition began in 1872 when Oxford took on a pink-clad Cambridge side, three years before Harvard first faced Yale on a football field. Since then, the two universities have met another 126 times, with Cambridge leading the series, 60-53, with 14 ties.

“The thing about both games is that they really embody the spirit of scholar-athletes,” said Johnson, who is enrolled in a two-year master’s program in economic and social history.

He will become the latest on a short list of Americans who have played in the Varsity Match, or have “earned a Blue.”

Cambridge has an American of its own in Doug Rowe, who also started last year’s Varsity Match at scrum half, though he never played football. Rowe, 33, was born in New York to British parents and earned two caps for the United States national team in 2005.

Johnson, a former offensive lineman, had never thought he would play the game until after he graduated from Harvard in 2006 and struck out on a series of N.F.L. tryouts; he was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots. He picked up rugby on a lark while working in San Francisco.

Soon, he was playing regularly for a local club as a 6-foot-3, 270-pound tight head prop and impressing a local coach named Ray Lehner, who happened to have played for Oxford. In exchange for Johnson’s services in a national tournament, Lehner offered to put him in touch with Hill at Oxford.

Then came the wake-up call, and the wheels were in motion. He improved so quickly that the American rugby community has taken notice. He helped the Eagles, the American national rugby team, qualify for the World Cup, and has been the subject of a profile in Rugby magazine.

Many of the skills in football and rugby overlap, which, Johnson said, helped him master some of the more subtle elements of scrummaging. Other skills he had to develop on his own since they were never part of his job on the offensive line. “You do get to catch and carry the ball,” he said, “which is really exciting after not touching one for four years.”

One American Hill has failed to recruit is Myron Rolle, the former Florida State safety who is studying at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. Still, after three seasons of Atlantic Coast Conference football, Rolle can appreciate a good college grudge match.

“I’d say it’s a little more civil than the Florida-Florida State rivalry,” Rolle said. “But there are definitely some feelings, some hard feelings, toward that other university in athletics.”

Rolle was particularly surprised by the mass e-mailings and fliers circulating among the student body urging the men to wear their school blazers and the women to wear dresses to come out and support the Blues. But the dress code is only the beginning of the fixture’s urbane traditions. Rugby, after all, is known in England as a game for hooligans played by gentlemen.

Oxford and Cambridge will meet in front of over 30,000 fans at Twickenham, the spiritual home of English rugby. And once they have spent 80 minutes running each other into the mud, the squads will meet for dinner at the Oxford and Cambridge Club on London’s Pall Mall.

That is the way it has been for decades. That is the way it will be Thursday. And it is certainly the way Pete Dawkins remembered it when he wrote himself into Varsity Match lore.

After winning the 1958 Heisman Trophy at Army, Dawkins traveled to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. When he arrived having never seen a rugby match, his fellow students at Brasenose College immediately insisted he try it. At 6-3, 210 pounds, he was bigger than most rugby players and clearly a gifted athlete.

“They spent a lot of time separate from the normal practices really drilling me and teaching me the game,” Dawkins said.

Within two months, Dawkins earned his first Blue. And for Oxford, the time invested in teaching him the basics of tries, scrums and conversions paid quick dividends. In his first Varsity Match, in 1959, Dawkins scored the winning try to snatch the title back from the Country Boys, as they are known, at Cambridge.

He played again in 1960 and 1961 as he completed a three-year program in politics, philosophy and economics. Dawkins said he could not recall many specific plays from his brief rugby career, but rugby definitely recalls his contribution.

In 1960 he invented the overhand delivery on lineouts, which are used to put the ball back into play from the sideline. Since then it has become the standard from schoolboys to the international level.

But at the time it was a gadget play known as the Yankee torpedo pass. It means that whether or not Americans play in the Varsity Match, their influence is woven in the fiber of a distinctly English sporting tradition.
365 2009-12-10 HONG KONG — The police in Beijing have forwarded to prosecutors their report on Liu Xiaobo, a prominent dissident who has been in detention for a year, Mr. Liu’s lawyer said on Wednesday.

The police detained Mr. Liu on Dec. 8, 2008, two days before the release of Charter 08, a manifesto by Mr. Liu and 302 others calling for democracy in China. He was formally arrested last summer and charged with seeking to subvert the state.

Mr. Liu’s lawyer, Shang Baojun, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that the police had sent to the prosecutors a report accusing Mr. Liu of inciting subversion by posting online essays favoring democracy and by helping to draft Charter 08.

The prosecutors typically take a month to six weeks to decide whether a police investigation report is adequate, Mr. Shang said. The prosecutors then either proceed to trial or, if the evidence is deemed insufficient, send the report back to the police for further review.

When Mr. Liu, a literary critic and former professor, was formally arrested last summer, he was accused, according to the official Xinhua news agency, of “agitation activities, such as spreading of rumors and defaming of the government, aimed at subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialism system.”
366 2009-12-10 COPENHAGEN  The top American envoy to climate talks here flatly rejected arguments Wednesday by diplomats from poor lands that the United States owes a debt to developing nations for decades of American emissions that contributed to global warming.

It was not the first time that the American negotiator, Todd D. Stern, had dismissed the notion. But his words highlighted the divide that persists between the poor and the wealthy as nearly 200 nations try to sketch the outlines of a new pact on climate change here.

Asked about arguments by diplomats and some protesters that the United States should provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid to developing nations as reparations, Mr. Stern, the special envoy for climate change, bluntly fired back at a news conference.

“I actually completely reject the notion of a debt or reparations or anything of the like,” he said. “For most of the 200 years since the Industrial Revolution, people were blissfully ignorant of the fact that emissions caused a greenhouse effect. It’s a relatively recent phenomenon.”

At the same time, he made clear that the United States was prepared to join other industrialized countries both in cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and in giving aid to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to deal with rising seas, drought and other phenomena that are expected to worsen as the planet warms.

Mr. Stern also demurred at a persistent proposal among some larger developing countries that the United States and other major emitters of long standing provide financial aid to emerging economic powerhouses, particularly China, to shift to cleaner energy technologies.

“China has $2 trillion in reserves,” said Mr. Stern, whose arrival in Copenhagen on Wednesday suggested that the talks, which run through Dec. 18, were moving into a more significant phase. “We don’t think China would be the first candidate for public funding.”

The framework for a potential accord must be in decent shape before top ministers arrive to prepare for the more than 100 heads of state, including President Obama, who will come to close out the negotiations at the end of next week.

For Mr. Obama and other leaders who have made action on climate a priority, the pressure is enormous to produce an agreement that has enough concrete commitments to be considered politically binding and pave the way for a formal treaty next year.

Reflecting the pressures on Mr. Obama, Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, defended the president’s record in a speech at the climate conference and made a pointed jab at Bush administration policies.

“In less than 11 months since taking office, we have done more to promote clean energy and prevent climate change than happened in the last eight years,” she said.

She cited investments under the fiscal stimulus bill, new fuel emissions standards for cars and her agency’s finding that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide pose a danger to public health, a decision that gives it regulatory power over emitters.

Ms. Jackson also sought to assure delegates that the Obama administration would press Congress to pass climate and energy legislation that is stalled in the Senate. The delays have fostered unease about Washington’s willingness to set emissions targets or ratify a global treaty should one be reached in 2010.

Across Copenhagen, police officers are meanwhile gearing up for protests. The police reported that they raided a building early Wednesday in the city’s Osterbro section and confiscated paint bombs and equipment like bolt cutters that they said demonstrators were readying to overcome barricades. No arrests were reported. A large-scale march is planned on Saturday.

392 2009-12-11 Peter R. Scanlon, a former chairman and chief executive of one of the world’s largest public accounting firms, died on Dec. 3 at his home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 78.

The cause was cancer, his daughter Barbara Scanlon Jessup said.

Mr. Scanlon led Coopers & Lybrand from 1982 to 1991; the firm merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998 to form PricewaterhouseCoopers. During his tenure, the company was regularly referred to as one of the Big Eight. But with consolidation in the industry, and with Arthur Andersen out of business, PricewaterhouseCoopers is now one of the Big Four.

In the late 1980s, under Mr. Scanlon, Coopers & Lybrand often drew criticism for shunning the merger mania that engulfed the accounting profession. Ultimately, however, the firm was credited with having turned the situation to its advantage. By attracting disaffected affiliates of its competitors in other countries, it was able to expand its international franchise without incurring the costs of all-out mergers.

“We’re not opposed to mergers, but we’re just not going to do it because everyone thinks it’s the right thing to do,” Mr. Scanlon told The New York Times in 1989.

Mr. Scanlon brought in major new clients, including SmithKline Beckman and Unilever, and expanded his company’s existing operations rather than opening new offices. In the process he steered its profitability close to that of the other big firms. In 1991, his last year as its leader, Coopers & Lybrand earned $261 million on revenues of $1.5 billion.
393 2009-12-11 The New York City police are investigating suspicious white powder found in envelopes at the American Express headquarters, near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Detective Mindy Diaz said no injuries were reported after the police were called to the building in Lower Manhattan on Thursday afternoon.

Three people who were exposed to the powder were decontaminated, Detective Diaz said. The powder was to be tested.

Joanna G. Lambert, a spokeswoman for American Express, said business was not interrupted.

In October and November 2001, five people were killed after coming in contact with mailings containing anthrax.

In November, at least four foreign missions to the United Nations received packages containing suspicious powder, but no one was harmed.
394 2009-12-11 “Battle on Late-Term Abortions Shifts to a Clinic in Nebraska” (front page, Dec. 4) reveals the dangerous tactics of the anti-abortion movement.

When the president of Operation Rescue brands Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart, who performs late-term abortions for women in need, a criminal, he sends a message to the most vengeful and unstable in his flock. The Nebraska attorney general further stirred the pot by telling a local TV station: “I’m disgusted ... I hate it that [Dr. Carhart’s] here in Nebraska and I hate it that he’s in America. I mean, this guy is one sick individual.” No wonder Dr. Carhart lives like a man under siege.

This issue is far greater than one targeted physician in one state — there is clearly a national effort to deny women their legal right to abortion care through any means. The United States Justice Department must investigate and prosecute this hostile campaign.

It takes extraordinary courage to stand up for women’s rights, knowing that it will make you Public Enemy No. 1 for the anti-abortion community. Yet that is exactly what Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart does every day. It is why he remains a hero to countless women and health care providers.

I wish every legislator could understand what I do: women will always need abortions, no matter what obstacles they face.

Years ago, Operation Rescue targeted the clinic where I worked. I remember performing an abortion as protesters battered the clinic doors with a telephone pole. When I finished, my frightened patient stood up and hugged me. “You can’t leave us now,” she said.

I know that Dr. Carhart will never abandon his patients. They know it, too. If only his opponents would listen.
395 2009-12-11 The viewership of soap operas, like antique jewelry, has been passed down through generations. Maybe it is genetic. Whether it is through nature or through nurture, however, these shows have secured familial bonds that cannot be broken no matter how many times a character goes to prison, sleeps with his wife’s sister or returns miraculously from the dead.

Soaps also serve as measuring sticks for friendships. Discovering which shows your friends watch gives you great insight into whether they were brought up right or not.

These seemingly trivial forms of entertainment are living traditions. And I fear I will not be able to carry on this piece of Americana with my own children.

First, “Guiding Light” was canceled. Now, it’s “As the World Turns.” It is just heartbreaking to realize that television history will be replaced with some show that will no doubt revolve around two women swapping families with hilarity ensuing after the vegan mother of four ends up on a cattle ranch.

I guess there is a price for nostalgia and good old-fashioned cat-fighting, and CBS, in particular, will not pay.
396 2009-12-11 Still, cracks in Copenhagen’s green facade were easy to spot on Friday at the nearby Stroget, a popular car-free shopping area in the city center. In the late afternoon every shop door was propped open, sending clouds of heated air into the chilly street.

Some cities impose fines on shopkeepers who allow excess energy to escape through open doors.

But Jan Michael Hansen, the executive director of Copenhagen City Center, an organization representing shops along the three-quarter-mile-long corridor, was nonplused. A closed door keeps customers away, which is bad for business, he explained.

He seemed puzzled that the visitor brought it up. “I have never had an inquiry like this before,” he said.

Planners seem to have worked double time reinforcing the green bona fides of the conference itself. Bottled water is banned (plenty is available on tap), some 200 bicycles have been made available for free use, and limousines shuttling dignitaries are fueled with plant waste.

Nonetheless, the United Nations estimates that when all of the emissions are tallied, the conference will have a climate-warming impact equivalent to about 40,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That is roughly equal to the annual emissions of 7,300 typical passenger cars.

Most of this is generated by travel to and from Copenhagen by the 15,000 participants (not including thousands of journalists).

Fear not, United Nations planners say: the greenhouse gases will be canceled out through investment in an emissions-reduction project in Bangladesh.

Groups like Greenpeace are deeply skeptical. Tarjei Haaland, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace, told The Copenhagen Post that claims of being “carbon neutral” were effectively meaningless.

At the farthest end of a hallway in the Bella Center, about 50 journalists and environmental campaigners crowded into a white cubicle. Word was that the investor George Soros was about to unveil a financial rescue plan for the planet.

The urgent question remains how much wealthy countries, which built their economies by burning fossil fuels, are willing to do for poorer ones that face the climatic consequences.

Mindful that rich countries are hamstrung by deficits and tight budgets, Mr. Soros said he had decided to wade into the debate on global warming.

He outlined a mechanism to fill the gap: the creation of a “green fund” from transfers of a virtual international currency called Special Drawing Rights. The currency would be backed by International Monetary Fund gold reserves, which are overvalued at the moment because of the drop in the dollar’s value. He estimated that the I.M.F. could make up to $100 billion available.

In the evening, reporters were still awaiting reactions from environmental analysts and diplomats, who said they had not quite finished digesting the plan.

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar was answering questions about his department’s decision to grant drilling rights to an oil company when a booming voice interrupted from the hall at the U.S. Center here.

It was his boss. President Obama’s acceptance speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo was being shown on big screens up and down the center.

Then both politicians were upstaged.

Rearing tall on its hind legs, a polar bear began pacing between the room where Mr. Salazar was defending Arctic Ocean drilling and a TV screen where Mr. Obama was defending American intervention in Afghanistan.

The bear admonished the president in a remarkably human voice. “He’s being celebrated now for his promise,” it said firmly. “Next week, let’s see if he can keep it.” (Video: dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com.)

Upon further inquiry, it was learned that the man inside the polar bear suit was Brendan Cumming of the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the federal lawsuit that led to the predator’s joining the Endangered Species List last year.
397 2009-12-11 Art Capital sued her in July 2009, claiming that Ms. Leibovitz, one of the world’s most famous photographers, had engaged in “boldly deceptive conduct” and failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars due under its agreements with her.

Three days after the September deadline, a joint statement from Ms. Leibovitz and Art Capital announced that the suit had been settled, the debt restructured and the deadline to pay it back extended.

As part of that deal, Ms. Leibovitz agreed to pay Art Capital an undisclosed sum to regain control of her homes and the copyrights to her work, which she had previously ceded to the lender for an increase in the loan amount. That caused Ms. Leibovitz’s debt to Art Capital to grow to about $30 million, said a financial industry source who has consulted with Ms. Leibovitz about her debt, and who spoke anonymously because of a confidentiality agreement.

Since then Ms. Leibovitz has been trying to leverage her photographic archive to pay off the debt. Through James Danziger, a gallery owner who had represented Ms. Leibovitz from 1990 to 2000, she has begun selling a limited-edition “Master Set” of 157 of her photographs. Only 10 sets are planned, and they are being offered for up to $3.5 million a set, although the prepublication price is lower, said Mr. Danziger in a phone interview from Miami. He was showing samples at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair last weekend, including well-known photographs of Queen Elizabeth and Cindy Crawford. The set includes images of Sontag, of Ms. Leibovitz’s children, and of landscapes. Lawrence Schiller, a writer, publisher and television producer who helped produce Ms. Leibovitz’s first book of photography in 1974, is also helping to market the master sets. He said three had already been sold. Mr. Schiller would not reveal what buyers paid, but said some of the prepublication sets were being offered for $2.5 million.

Mr. Schiller said he had been helping Ms. Leibovitz take stock of her archives to determine how to use it to pay her debts, but in a measured fashion that would not suggest desperation.

Ms. Leibovitz still owes Random House a book under an existing contract, but she has “been talking” with Benedikt Taschen, owner of the art book company Taschen, said Amy Quinn, an assistant to Mr. Taschen.

Mr. Danziger declined to comment about any possible publishing deals, but said “there is interest in her work in terms of book sales, print assignments and advertising assignments.”

As she tries to increase her earnings, Ms. Leibovitz is also seeking to restructure her debt. She has met with the Pullman Group, the company that issued bonds based on the catalogs of Mr. Bowie, James Brown, the Isley Brothers and others, according to the source who consulted with Ms. Leibovitz but is bound by confidentiality. But Ms. Leibovitz would have to demonstrate that her future earnings would arrive in a dependable and clearly accountable fashion before any bonds could be sold, the source said.

Despite the flurry of activity, Ms. Leibovitz is not yet in the clear. If she misses any payments, many of which require installments of hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, she is subject to foreclosure, said a source familiar with the loan terms who requested anonymity because the person is not authorized to discuss them. The entire loan is due next summer, the source said.

A mortgage filed with New York City in October notes, partially in capital letters, the urgency and complexity of the agreements between Ms. Leibovitz and Art Capital: “TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE with respect to each and every covenant, agreement, and obligation of mortgagors under this mortgage, the secured loan agreement and any and all of the other loan documents.”
398 2009-12-11 I don’t mean to absolve the Obama administration of all responsibility. Clearly, the administration proposed a that was too small to begin with and was whittled down further by “centrists” in the Senate. And the measures proposed earlier this week, while they would create a significant number of additional jobs, fall far short of what the economy needs.

But while economic analysis says that we should have a large second stimulus, the political reality is that the president — faced with total obstruction from Republicans, while receiving only lukewarm support from some in his own party — probably can’t get enough votes in Congress to do more than tinker at the edges of the employment problem.

The Fed, however, can do more.

Mr. Bernanke has received a great deal of , and rightly so, for his use of unorthodox strategies to contain the damage after failed. But both the Fed’s actions, as measured by its expansion of credit, and Mr. Bernanke’s words suggest that the urgency of late 2008 and early 2009 has given way to a curious mix of complacency and fatalism — a sense that the Fed has done enough now that the financial system has stepped back from the brink, even though its own forecasts predict that unemployment will remain punishingly high for at least the next three years.

The most specific, persuasive case I’ve seen for more Fed action comes from Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed staffer now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Basing his analysis on the prior work of none other than Mr. Bernanke himself, in his previous incarnation as an economic researcher, Mr. Gagnon urges the Fed to expand credit by buying a further $2 trillion in assets. Such a program could do a lot to promote faster growth, while having hardly any downside.

So why isn’t the Fed doing it? Part of the answer may be political: Ideological opponents of government activism tend to be as critical of the Fed’s credit expansion as they are of the Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus. And this has probably made the Fed reluctant to use its powers to their fullest extent. Meanwhile, a significant number of Fed officials, especially at the regional , are obsessed with the fear of 1970s-style inflation, which they see lurking just around the bend even though there’s not a hint of it in the actual data.

But there’s also, I believe, a question of priorities. The Fed sprang into action when faced with the prospect of wrecked banks; it doesn’t seem equally concerned about the prospect of wrecked lives.

And that is what we’re talking about here. The kind of sustained high unemployment envisaged in the Fed’s own forecasts is a recipe for immense human suffering — millions of families losing their savings and their homes, millions of young Americans never getting their working lives properly started because there are no jobs available when they graduate. If we don’t get unemployment down soon, we’ll be paying the price for a generation.

So it’s time for the Fed to lose that complacency, shrug off that fatalism and start lending a hand to job creation.
399 2009-12-11 A $60 million project to extract renewable energy from the hot bedrock deep beneath Basel, Switzerland, was shut down permanently on Thursday after a government study determined that earthquakes generated by the project were likely to do millions of dollars in damage each year.

The project, led by Markus O. Häring, a former oilman, was suspended in late 2006 after it generated earthquakes that did no bodily harm but caused about $9 million in mostly minor damage to homes and other structures. Mr. Häring is to go to trial next week on criminal charges stemming from the project. On Thursday, he did not respond to messages asking for comment.

The findings are a serious blow to the hopes of environmentalists, entrepreneurs and investors who believe that advanced geothermal energy could substantially cut the world’s use of emissions-causing fossil fuels. The report comes as the United States Energy Department is preparing its own review of the safety of a closely related project, by a start-up company called AltaRock Energy, in the hills north of San Francisco.

The AltaRock project is the Obama administration’s first major test of advanced geothermal energy. Like the Basel project, AltaRock’s plan is to drill miles underground, fracture hot bedrock and circulate water through it to generate steam. The Energy Department began its review after an article in The New York Times in June raised questions about whether AltaRock had been forthcoming about the earthquakes set off by the fracturing in Basel. The AltaRock project has also been plagued with technical problems.

Scientists said on Thursday that because the Swiss report focused narrowly on the Basel project and also contained positive findings, it would not prove fatal to advanced geothermal energy as a whole.
400 2009-12-11 The Medicare buy-in proposal is intended to fill a gap in the social safety net for millions of people nearing retirement who are unable to obtain or afford insurance. In general, the new Medicare option would be available only to people who are uninsured. People 55 to 64 who have employer-sponsored insurance would be expected to keep it.

Preliminary back-of-the-envelope calculations reflect the steep challenges that Senate Democrats face as they await a new cost analysis of their plan. The numbers also reflect potential pitfalls in the politically appealing message to constituents that they might get benefits similar to those of federal lawmakers.

Affordability for individuals and families, however, is hardly the only challenge facing Senate Democrats as they struggle to put together a proposal that can win the 60 votes needed for passage of the broader health care bill.

Senators from rural states voiced deep reservations on Thursday about the Medicare buy-in plan, which they said would hurt hospitals, doctors and other health care providers back home.

In addition to allowing people to buy in to Medicare, the Democrats’ latest plan would designate the federal Office of Personnel Management to oversee at least two new nonprofit national insurance plans.

The plans would be administered by private companies, but the personnel office would negotiate prices as it does now for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Federal employee unions and retiree groups expressed apprehension about asking the agency to take on the task of supervising health plans for millions more people.

Margaret L. Baptiste, the president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said: “O.P.M. should be in the business of attracting the best and brightest to federal service.” The agency’s mission, she said, is “is too important to dilute with the massive undertaking of creating and administering a new health care system.”

Some insurance experts said that creating a menu of national plans could provide consumers with an array of interesting new choices that could meet their personal health care needs.

“It’s more choice for consumers, and it’s more good choice for consumers,” said Walton J. Francis, an insurance consultant and expert on the program for federal employees.

But Mr. Francis warned against the Medicare buy-in proposal, which he said would undermine the new national plans and would leave people nearing retirement with insufficient coverage.

“Medicare is not a good health plan,” Mr. Francis said. Even with coverage of prescription drugs, he said, “it still doesn’t have catastrophic protection.”

In response to questions from the Congressional Budget Office, Senate leaders provided additional details of the proposal announced hastily on Tuesday by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada:

¶The new Medicare option would be available only to individuals, not to families. In a household consisting of a 60-year-old man, his 50-year-old wife and their 18-year-old daughter, only the man would be eligible for Medicare.

¶People 55 to 64 would receive the same benefits as people in the traditional Medicare program. The Democrats’ bill would limit out-of-pocket spending on health care by people in private plans ($5,000 a year for individuals and $10,000 for families). Medicare does not have such limits.

¶Medicare premiums for people under 65 would differ from those paid by people 65 and older, and the two parts of the program would be financed separately.

Marilyn Moon, a health economist and former public trustee of Medicare, said that for people 55 to 64, Medicare premiums could be higher than premiums charged by private health plans.

Health policy experts said that the people who chose to enroll in Medicare were likely to be heavy users of health care, with higher-than-average costs.

Moreover, Ms. Moon noted, private plans would have large numbers of healthy people under the age of 55, whose premiums could help cover costs for those 55 to 64. “Such cross-subsidies would not be available under the new Medicare option,” she said.

Democratic senators generally shied away from explaining or defending their Medicare proposal, on the ground that it was being analyzed by the budget office.

Republicans denounced the proposal, saying it would add new financial obligations to a program that could not afford its existing commitments.

“If the Titanic is sinking, the last thing you want to do is to put Grandma and more of your family on the boat,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.

But several liberal House Democrats welcomed the Medicare proposal.

“Extending this successful program to those between 55 and 64 would be the largest expansion of Medicare in 44 years and would perhaps get us on the path to a single-payer model,” said Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York.
401 2009-12-11 The logic of the off-balance sheet treatment of such things as structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, which banks created in order to get assets off their books, was that the bank did not control them, and so did not have to show the SIV assets, and liabilities, on its own books.

That fiction evaporated early in the financial crisis. Some SIVs were among the first structures to fail, when they could not roll over loans to finance assets that had lost value. The banks chose to, or had to, rescue the SIVs. Maybe they did so to guard their reputations, or maybe they feared they would have been vulnerable to fraud allegations from those who lent to the leaking SIVs. In either case, it turned out there was a black hole that the regulatory rules had ignored in assessing how much capital the banks needed to hold.

There are other examples. Bank holding companies have been allowed to issue something called “trust preferred securities.” The beauty of those securities was that they were really debt that the holding companies could call capital. Having that “capital” meant the bank could take on more debt. A system that lets a bank borrow more money because it has already borrowed money — rather than because it has sold stock — is hardly a wise one.

All this was part of what financial engineers openly called “capital arbitrage,” in which they created securities and structures whose purpose was to let banks slide around the capital rules. Regulators seem to have responded by assuming that everything would be fine.

“Capital arbitrage has been an issue for years,” Ms. Bair told me this week. “Nobody wanted to take away the punch bowl.” She thinks a council of regulators, with an appointed chairman, could monitor the systemic risk created by rising risk levels in the banking system and take away the bowl the next time.

Of course, banks also engaged in regulatory arbitrage, by moving from one regulator to another to seek more lenient treatment. Their route to regulatory success — at least in terms of building an empire — was to spike the punch bowl.

The banks now want to stop FASB from forcing them to mark assets to market, or reveal their current market value. And they have some sympathy from bank regulators, which fear that marking to market can make banks look too healthy in good times and too unhealthy in bad times.

That appalls investors. “The purpose of financial reporting is to convey the results of the company,” said Sandra Peters, the director of financial reporting for the CFA Institute, an investor advocacy group. “It is not to assure the company stays around.”

Mr. Herz, the chairman of the accounting standards board that determines what are “generally accepted accounting principles,” or GAAP, this week proposed further “decoupling” of capital rules and accounting standards. He noted that in some cases the capital rules were already stricter than accounting rules, and said that if bank regulators want to base the capital rules on the original cost of assets, rather than market value, they should at least let investors also see the market value. “Handcuffing regulators to GAAP or distorting GAAP to always fit the needs of regulators is inconsistent with the different purposes of financial reporting and prudential regulation,” he said in a speech.

Ms. Bair sounded hesitant about that when I spoke to her, saying she was concerned that decoupling could lead FASB to stop listening to bank regulators, something Mr. Herz said would not happen.

She said she would like to see one accounting change that FASB is talking about, which would make it easier for banks to take reserves against loans in good times. “With better reserving methodology,” she said, capital and reserves would have been higher before the current crisis erupted, and banks safer.

The financial crisis showed that regulators should have required banks to hold much more capital than they did. Some regulators figured that out.

In Spain, some smaller banks are in trouble from real estate loans, but the big banks seem to have emerged in good shape. One reason is that Spanish regulators were not fooled by things like SIVs, and insisted that if any bank wanted to create one, it could, but would have to hold reserves anyway. Since there was no business reason — other than capital arbitrage — for a SIV, those banks shied away. Good regulation is not easy. A new paper by Amir E. Khandani and Andrew W. Lo of M.I.T., and Robert C. Merton of Harvard, estimates that repeated “cash-out” refinancings of mortgages led to more than $1 trillion in additional losses in this crisis.

It used to be that people who had owned homes for a longer time were less leveraged than recent purchasers, but the refinancing boom changed that. “A coordinated increase in leverage among homeowners during good times will lead to sharply higher correlations in defaults among those same homeowners in bad times,” they wrote.

But they added that it was hard to imagine any existing regulator acting against any of the causes of the refinancing boom — rising home prices, new mortgage products and low interest rates. Those developments allowed more people to buy homes, made Americans richer, and fueled both economic growth and consumer spending.

“Which politician or regulator would seek to interrupt such a virtuous circle?” they asked. “How could such a maverick accomplish the task?”

Their solution is to create a systemic risk regulator. But it is far from clear that such a regulator, had it been around the last time, would have had the wisdom to take away the punch bowl in time. If it had, it probably would have lacked the power.

Nonetheless, it is a good idea to try such a regulator, and to give the job to someone who is not conflicted by other responsibilities. Expecting any regulator to perform multiple tasks is asking for trouble when goals may conflict. The Fed’s pursuit of economic growth helped to create the refinancing boom that backfired.

That fact is why multiple regulators can make sense. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which supervises FASB, knows that investor protection is its job. Bank regulators have nothing against that, but it is not a primary goal. It is to be hoped that the bank regulators will adopt wise capital standards, but not at the expense of letting investors know what is going on.
402 2009-12-11 There was also a hint in the studies that the drugs might have a particular impact on curbing the kinds of tumors that are the most difficult to treat: those that are not fueled by estrogen.

“With tamoxifen and raloxifene, we have drugs that reduce estrogen receptor-positive tumors, but we’ve never had anything worth anything that prevented estrogen receptor-negative tumors,” said Dr. Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, who directs the breast cancer research program at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

But Dr. Hortobagyi said randomized controlled clinical trials were needed to prove the drugs have an effect, adding, “These are provocative data, but certainly not compelling, and not definitive.”

Other breast cancer experts agreed. “If in fact you have osteoporosis and you’re taking these drugs, it’s possible there is an added benefit,” said Dr. Eric P. Winer, a breast cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “But at the moment, I don’t think these studies should be used as a reason to take a bisphosphonate to prevent breast cancer. As with all drugs, there are side effects and risks.”

About 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, many of them women. Last year more than 45 million prescriptions for oral bisphosphonates were filled in the United States, generating over $4.9 billion in sales, according to IMS Health, a health care information and consulting company. The drugs have been associated with a rare but very serious side effect: bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw, in which part of the jawbone dies and becomes exposed.

The new research included an analysis of data from the Women’s Health Initiative, which included 151,592 postmenopausal women followed on average for 7.8 years, among them 2,216 who happened to be taking oral bisphosphonates at the beginning of the study.

There were 3.29 cancers per 1,000 women taking the drugs over the course of a year, compared with 4.38 cancers per 1,000 women not taking the drugs. After adjusting for different risk factors among those who were or were not taking the drugs, the analysis determined there were 32 percent fewer new breast cancers among users of oral bisphosphonates.

Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, the study’s author and a researcher at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center, said the drugs might have toxic effects on tumor cells or affect pathways that disrupt cell proliferation.

The second set of findings comes from a continuing population-based case-control study of 4,575 postmenopausal women in Israel that used interviews and pharmacy records to determine whether oral bisphosphonates were used before a cancer diagnosis. It found that women who used the drugs for over a year had a 29 percent relative reduction in risk for breast cancer, and that tumors that developed among users were more likely to be estrogen receptor-positive.

“We’re reporting an association,” said the study author, Dr. Gad Rennert of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. “If the story is right and true — and I’ll repeat this 100 times, because in science you never know, I think it is but I can’t guarantee it — it’s quite meaningful.”

Dr. Rennert said the research was bolstered by a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine this year that reported that premenopausal breast cancer patients who had infusions of a bone-loss drug called zoledronic acid were a third less likely to have a recurrence and metastases than women who did not get it. Users of the drug were also less likely to develop a new cancer in the opposite breast.

Bisphosphonates are already widely used in the management of breast cancer patients to counter bone loss associated with hormonal therapy and to decrease pain and bone complications in advanced cancer. Recent reports have suggested that the drugs’ effects on bone appear to inhibit the spread of cancer to the bone and improve survival.

But experts warn there is ample reason for caution in interpreting the new studies. Older women who take oral bisphosphonates generally do so because they have low bone mineral density. But women with that condition may be at lower risk for developing breast cancer in the first place; their bone problems are believed to stem from lower estrogen levels, and breast cancer risk increases with higher lifelong exposure to estrogen.
403 2009-12-11 Patricia Highsmith wrote 22 novels, many of them set in Greenwich Village, where she lived. But the landscape of Highsmith Country consists not only of the physical Village neighborhood, but also the dark and desperate territory of Highsmith’s psyche.

“She is our most Freudian novelist,” said Joan Schenkar, whose biography of Highsmith was released this week by St. Martin’s Press. Having spent nearly eight years on the book, “The Talented Miss Highsmith,” Ms. Schenkar is the perfect tour guide for this novelist’s world. Standing in front of the red-brick building at 35 Morton Street where the 19-year-old Highsmith took a summer sublet in 1940 to escape her mother and stepfather, Ms. Schenkar continued: “To her, love and death are closely related. She tends to murder people in her novels where she made love in real life.”

Morton Street was where Highsmith “started her lifelong career of aggressive seduction,” Ms. Schenkar explained. It is also where Kenneth Rowajinski, the psychopathic dog killer, is murdered in her 1972 novel “A Dog’s Ransom.” (The unlucky poodle, Tina, bears the name of a dog owned by one of her amours.) “She kills so many dogs,” Ms. Schenkar said of Highsmith. “She hated dogs. She couldn’t bear sharing attention.”

On this steel gray, rainy day  “perfect Highsmith weather”  Ms. Schenkar was dressed in black. Her corkscrew-curled hair formed a circular bonnet around her face and matched the shape of her wire-rimmed glasses.

Highsmith is best known for “Strangers on a Train,” which Alfred Hitchcock made into a movie in 1951, and “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” made into a film with Matt Damon and Jude Law in 1999. Both novels feature sociopaths and murder. (Perhaps you are beginning to see a pattern.)

Ms. Schenkar is convinced that if Highsmith had not become a writer, she would have been a murderer. “From age 8 she wanted to kill her stepfather,” she said, strolling north toward Grove Street, “She was born to murder. She had the mind of a criminal genius.”

In her 1969 novel, “The Tremor of Forgery,” Highsmith aptly turned her coffee-colored Olympia portable typewriter on which she banged out her fiction into a murder weapon in the hands of a writer named Howard Ingham. (He hurls it at a thieving intruder, smashing him in the head.)

Whatever innate characteristics she might have been born with, the circumstances that tortured Highsmith through her life included: a self-loathing of her lesbianism; resentment that she didn’t gain entry to New York’s highest social stratum; and a destructive love-hate relationship with her mother, Mary, who, when Patricia was 12, left the heartbroken child to live in Fort Worth with her grandmother for a year.

“It’s never a good idea to fall in love with your mother,” Ms. Schenkar commented dryly. Despite their volatile and venomous relationship, she could never be very far from her. Even that first sublet was only a couple of blocks away from her parents’ one-bedroom apartment at 48 Grove Street, where she slept on a pull-out couch in the living room. Sidney Hook, the radical leftist philosopher, lived downstairs.

Ms. Schenkar stopped in front of the building, took a small thin cigar out of a metal case and lighted it.

We were engaging in ambulomancy or “divination by walking,” Ms. Schenkar explained, stepping through Highsmith country in order to understand the writer herself. “Every physical location is also an emotional location,” Ms. Schenkar noted.

She pointed across the street to a Federal mansion: “John Wilkes Booth supposedly plotted the assassination of Lincoln there.”

Throughout Highsmith’s more than four-decade career, her fictional world was often inspired by the curving, crooked streets of Greenwich Village, where she lived in the late 1930s and ’40s. “It was her creative store,” Ms. Schenkar said, “her little museum of America” that she took with her to Europe when she moved there in the 1960s. Her novel “Found in the Street” takes place in the late 1980s, yet the details are from an earlier era; “the canapés are from the 1950s,” Ms. Schenkar said with a laugh.

That novel’s wealthy, sexually obsessed couple, the Sutherlands, live on Grove Street; the object of their attention and their murder victim, Elsie Tyler, is killed a few blocks away, in her apartment at 102 Greene Street, where Highsmith’s ex-lover, the painter Buffie Johnson, owned a loft.
404 2009-12-11 So it proves when the comely Princess of France (Michelle Terry) shows up on political business for her father, conveniently accompanied by three attractive companions: Rosaline (Thomasin Rand), Maria (Jade Anouka) and Katherine (Siân Robins-Grace). It goes without saying that the girls are — marginally — more mature than their male foils and always maintain the upper hand.

This convergence of the sexes has a mathematical symmetry that will be subjected to various ruptures and rearrangements before the revels are over. But the attendant flirtations have an unusually high tone, as all these potential lovers have been well schooled in the art of verbal jousting.

So have the two elderly pedants (Christopher Godwin and Patrick Godfrey) who hang about Ferdinand’s court, along with a lisping Spanish grandee (Paul Ready) and his pert page (Seroca Davis). A couple of crude rustics (Rhiannon Oliver and Fergal McElherron) and a dimwitted constable (Andrew Vincent) are also on hand to make their own, often deflating contributions to the various linguistic melees.

Such plot as there is has to do with how the guys get the girls’ attention (of course they disguise themselves at one point) and who outscores whom in intellectual sports. More than in any Shakespeare play, the word’s the thing. And since the words here are sometimes in Latin and often arranged into ornate declensions, this comedy can be the sort of heavy reading that sends your eye darting to footnotes every fourth or fifth line.

Yet on the stage, which here simulates (indoors) the outdoor Globe in London, this “Love’s Labour’s Lost” feels anything but dry. As the ensemble scampers merrily and distractedly in Elizabethan garb (occasionally venturing with charming disrespect into the audience), there’s a feeling of springtime headiness, of fresh sap rising.

At the same time, Jonathan Fensom’s set, which evokes the sylvan illustrations and ornamentation of a courtly text, reminds us that it’s a highly artificial world in which these games of love occur. Even as he celebrates the limitlessness of language in “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” Shakespeare is also pointing out the limits of living by words alone. The mortal body, which includes the heart, has needs that no well-shaped metaphor can meet.

Mr. Dromgoole makes maximal use of the disparity between trained mind and animal instinct. The superficiality of the royal scholars is delightfully conveyed by their synchronized ritualistic movements in the early scenes. Once each knows the others have broken their vows, the comedy becomes more brutally physical, à la Abbott and Costello. But even when the characters are engaged in semantic debate, repeating and distorting one another’s words, there’s an air of high farce abroad, reminding us that the classic “Who’s on first?” routine is a form of philosophical discourse.

From this vibrant verbal palette, some distinctively painted portraits emerge. Each of the eight courtly lovers wears his or her dignity (or lack thereof) with individual style. Mr. Ready’s Don Adriano de Armado, a wilting poseur with a hangdog air and a Castillian lisp, is an inspired, oddly affecting comic creation. And Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Godwin’s venerable, fatuous (and flatulent) pedants remind us that it is possible in an academic environment to avoid growing up altogether.

It is Ms. Terry’s princess, though, who provides the most acute glimpses of a longer view, one that encompasses more than intellectual frivolity. A rising star at the National Theater in London, where she appeared memorably as Helena in “All’s Well That Ends Well” this year, Ms. Terry has a naturally buoyant comic spirit set off by a firm sense of gravity.

She memorably whoops it up amid some boisterous Punch and Judy antics, but a melancholy wisdom resides beneath the sorority-sister surface. The princess’s ruminations on the cruelty of hunting the deer she will shoot so expertly are delivered with a sobriety that reminds us that death is, after all, no mere metaphysical conceit.

That moment — along with a scene in which Mr. Godfrey’s character reads a love poem with almost shocking tenderness — helps keep us aware that these people whose stylish skirmishes we are so enjoying are living almost entirely on the bright shell of life, rarely penetrating into the meatier stuff within.

In the play’s final moments, the shell is abruptly cracked open. And the rustic songs that conclude the comedy — simple, profound tunes in which nature asserts its eternal cycles — eloquently signal that school is out forever. So begins that endlessly complicated business known as real life.

405 2009-12-11 "Once I saw this place and this beach, that just was it,” said Mr. Schmidt, who is originally from Southern California but worked as a livestock farmer with his wife outside St. Paul for 36 years. The couple first bought a second home on the beach at Playa Hermosa, Costa Rica, in 2002 for $150,000, calling the impulse buy “a total fluke,” and migrated to Nicaragua after his wife’s retirement in 2006.

“By the time I was ready to retire, it had already gotten so touristic down there that we just wanted to go somewhere else,” Ms. Schmidt said of Costa Rica. “And Bob wanted to be on a surf break. So here we are.”

Some might see an element of financial risk in the Schmidts’ purchase of the sort of property that one segment of buyers view as an investment, but Mr. Schmidt said that he and his wife were not driven by the profit motive. "We came down here really not as an investment per se,” he said. “It was more of a lifestyle change.” Life at Hacienda Iguana, a gated development about 20 miles northwest of San Juan del Sur with 250 home lots and over 70 condos already built, moseys along at a paradisiacal, watch-dissolving pace. Tidal swings and sunsets mark the day’s most important events.

“I think our buyers now are end users,” said Zach Lunin, a co-founder of Aurora Beachfront Realty in San Juan del Sur. “The people who are buying with us and investing here are people who want to spend time here. Bottom line is most of the people that we’re seeing are not the flippers. Nicaragua is a heart buy for most people, not that it doesn’t make sense on paper. But people come here and they fall in love with the country, and that’s why they buy property."

Considering that Nicaragua scored an underwhelming 2.5 out of a possible 10 for honesty in the Worldwide Corruption Perception Index of 2009 (the United States was at 7.5, Canada at 8.7 and Mexico at 3.3) as tallied by Transparency International, the romance may include a few speed bumps. (“If you drive to Managua, it is very unlikely that you won’t be pulled over,” Mr. Schmidt said of the incessant traffic shakedowns and bribery attempts performed on gringos by police patrolling the roads.) And while Nicaragua’s coming 2011 presidential election is a reminder of the country’s political uncertainty, not all foreigners are so easily deterred.

“Nicaragua kind of acts like a natural filter,” Mr. Lunin said. “It’s not everybody who gets on a plane and says, ‘Let’s go down to Nicaragua,’ whereas it is everybody who gets on a plane and goes to Costa Rica.”

The impression that Nicaragua is inherently unstable has unquestionably slowed development, but it has also made an investment in “the New Costa Rica,” more affordable and appealing to the adventurous segment of aspiring second-home owners. In many cases the numbers support the gamble. In 2008 tourism brought in an estimated $944 million (nearly one-sixth of the G.D.P.), and it has grown by 8.2 percent in the past year, with almost 24 percent of visitors hailing from the United States.

Oceanfront lots in gated, rural communities like Hacienda Iguana are selling for around $250,000, and according to some real estate agents, prices have dropped as much as 40 percent in the last two years.

Unlike in many countries, property laws afford foreigners the same land rights as Nicaraguan citizens, and while the Coastal Law of 2009 prevents the purchase of land within 50 meters of the high tide line and oceanfront lots are eligible for purchase only if registered before a 1917 agrarian reform law, land acquisition in Nicaragua is a relatively straightforward process — albeit with a few notable concerns.

Because the Sandinista regime confiscated nearly 28,000 properties between 1979 and 1990 in the name of land redistribution, acquiring undisputed titles has become a central issue for foreign investors. “Most of my clients want title insurance, and I recommend it to them, because it gives them added peace of mind,” said Byron Mejia, a real estate lawyer in Managua. “Whatever we miss, the title insurance company picks up, so we don’t leave any stone uncovered. Sometimes if there’s a problem with the title, you stop right there.”

Aside from potential title disputes, aspiring second-home owners may have to consider the muddled process of constructing their getaways from afar. “We’ve watched some of the people who have had to rely on somebody else to supervise,” Ms. Schmidt said. “It’s a difficult process, and things aren’t done the way you might think they would be done. You can’t take anything for granted.”

The “out of sight ...” principle applies not only to construction, but also to protecting and maintaining the asset, so hiring security and caretakers is essential. “It’s common sense,” Mr. Mejia said. “Let’s say you have a home — oceanfront property you visit three or four times a year. If you leave it unattended, it’s like New York City. Someone’s going to break in.”

While there may be fewer potential buyers than at the height of the real estate boom, those still in the hunt say they are realistic about Nicaragua’s political situation. “I don’t think we’ll bury ourselves in research on how stable it is,” said Charles Brooks, an insurance executive from Virginia who is considering the purchase of a lot in a development inland of Hacienda Iguana called Iguana Hills.

“I think we’ll take a leap of faith,” he said. “It’s money that’s at risk, perhaps, but not any more risky than watching your 401k. And it’s a lot more fun. There’s truly an upside to it.”
406 2009-12-11 Moving to quell the uproar over the return of big paydays on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs announced on Thursday that its top executives would forgo cash bonuses this year and that it would give shareholders a say in determining compensation.

With a resurgent Goldman set to award billions of dollars in bonuses — a trove that could rival the record payouts of the bubble years — the bank said that its 30 most-senior executives would be paid in the form of a special stock, rather than in cash. Goldman said that it would also let its shareholders vote on its executives’ pay, although the decision would be nonbinding.

A year after Washington rescued the nation’s financial industry with billions of taxpayer dollars, Goldman is enjoying one of the most profitable years in its 140-year history. Its bonanza — fostered by its own government bailout, as well as the rescue of the broader financial system — has angered the many ordinary Americans who are still waiting for an economic recovery.

Much of the resentment has been directed at Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who after first staunchly defending the bank’s outsize profits and pay, and then bristling at calls for restraint, apologized for mistakes that led to the financial crisis.

Whether Goldman’s shareholders will contest its pay practices is uncertain. Goldman insists that it must pay its employees well to keep them from defecting to rivals. So far, it has set aside $16.7 billion to pay its workers this year, a figure that translates into roughly $700,000 an employee. Top producers will earn millions.

Goldman stockholders, who have been richly rewarded as the bank’s share price soared roughly 82 percent this year, may be reluctant to challenge the bank’s pay practices. Indeed, Goldman has reached out to big investors to make its case.
407 2009-12-11 And the Treasury’s Office of Financial Stability on Thursday released a report, which Mr. Geithner had already disclosed, showing that the relief program’s losses were likely to be a fraction of the $700 billion allotted, while the portion for banks was making a profit. The independent Government Accountability Office audited the report.

On Wednesday, Mr. Geithner announced that he was extending the $700 billion program, which was created at the height of the financial panic in 2008, to next Oct. 3. It had been scheduled to expire at the end of this year.

While big banks are mostly stabilized, he told the panel on Thursday, the program is needed to help reduce home foreclosures and for a new initiative to get capital to smaller banks so they, in turn, will lend money to the credit-starved small businesses that create most jobs.

Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard Law School professor who heads the panel, pressed Mr. Geithner about the Treasury’s record on stimulating credit from small banks. She noted that the department had started three programs within the overall relief effort to spur lending to small businesses “and clearly has not gotten the job done.”

“What’s going to be different now, Mr. Secretary?” she asked.

Mr. Geithner countered that the initiatives had helped. The problem, he said, is that smaller banks “have been very reluctant to come and do business with the government.” They fear they will be “stigmatized” as weak, he said, and that the government might later impose new restrictions.

He said the administration would work with Congress to change the law “to help deal with those basic concerns.”

The panel’s deputy chairman, Damon Silvers, a special counsel for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., raised concerns that some big banks might be getting out of the bailout program too soon because they are eager to escape restrictions on executives’ pay. Bank of America recently repaid its $45 billion in bailout money, and Citigroup is exploring the possibility of raising billions through a share offering to do the same.

“Premature repayment when these banks are weak is bad for the country,” Mr. Silvers said.

Mr. Geithner replied: “And we would not allow that or support it.”

Because financial institutions must raise equity in the stock market to repay their government loans, he said, that is a test of those companies’ strength since they would not be able to attract investors otherwise.

But Mr. Silvers pointed out that Bank of America had just raised $19 billion of its $45 billion in the markets. Mr. Geithner said he would provide more information on the bank’s case later.

Several panel members questioned why the government had paid A.I.G’s major business customers in full for their complicated transactions with the failed company — dealing with them much like small depositors in a bankrupt bank. The counterparties included major institutions like Goldman Sachs that had also received bailout money.

“You are telling me that these counterparty obligations — these financial instruments that are bought by very sophisticated parties — are going to be treated effectively like deposits in checking accounts and savings accounts,” Ms. Warren said.

Mr. Geithner said, “You either prevent default, because default would be cataclysmic, or you don’t. And when you prevent default, you’re doing so so they can meet their obligations to everyone they have contractual obligations to.”

But Mr. Silvers suggested the counterparties could have been made to accept “a negotiated haircut” from their claims — a criticism the relief program’s inspector general had raised previously.

Paul S. Atkins, a former Republican member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was the one panelist at the hearing who opposed extending the relief. The administration and Congress are using the program as “a blank check,” he said, to finance additional stimulus spending and tax cuts.

While the program cannot directly pay for such measures, Democrats argue that newly identified savings can be counted for budgetary purposes as offsetting the costs of efforts to spur job creation.
408 2009-12-11 “It is definitely scary — we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Mr. Williams said, after pulling merchandise sold on their Web site off the racks to pack and ship from home later that night. “We’re trying as hard as we can, because we know it’s really difficult right now.

“There’s never a day off — I’m sure everyone says that, but it doesn’t even seem like there’s an hour off. You know, 2 in the morning on Sunday night I’m still working on the Web site.”

So for this, their first holiday season selling the corseted dresses, tulle petticoats, over-the-knee socks and parasols they hope work as gifts, they have extended their hours, opening on Mondays, often a slow day in the neighborhood.

But now the Con Ed truck, occasionally belching fumes, was threatening to flood the store with smoke and drive away what few drop-ins might pass by. Mr. Williams took up his post at the front counter, standing over a laptop to answer e-mail messages that had arrived the night before, pausing to make the temperamental CD player work, occasionally eyeing the truck and shaking his head as the Britpop strains of Elastica finally filled the room.

“We have customers,” Mr. Williams declared that evening, after a late-afternoon Web and e-mail announcement of a sudden 10 percent in-store discount brought a young woman shopping for her sister into the boutique. “We just need more of them.”

Indeed, much of the couple’s business — 30 to 40 percent — comes through the Web site, which they started in February to help build a following for the store.

Mr. Williams, who grew up in New Jersey and studied film at New York University, has worked in retail and in Web site production for years. Mrs. Fukuda-Williams grew up in Tokyo, and she would hang out with her friends in the Harajuku district, the street-level catwalk of Japanese style cults, where she first came across Lolita.

The style, which has evolved over decades, now has several subgenres, including the sugary Victoriana of the Sweet Lolita and the harder-edged dark garb of her cousin, the Gothic Lolita. Devotees of the style often plan meet-ups and other events, a circuit the store has begun to tap into using Twitter and Facebook. Some customers come to hang out — as a small group did on Monday afternoon — and maybe look at the Japanese Lolita magazines on display, as well as to shop.

Yes, there are challenges. The weakness of the dollar against the yen has sometimes made customers think the couple was overcharging, Mr. Williams said, so now he posts each day’s exchange rate on a white board near the cash register.

Mrs. Fukuda-Williams has to juggle work and school by studying on the train and using her iPhone to place orders with the Japanese companies that supply the store. And the tasks seem endless. After closing Monday night, the store became an impromptu photo studio, as Mr. Williams brought out lights and a digital camera to shoot new inventory to post on the Web site.

Asked how long they can keep going like that, he said, “Not forever,” adding that they hoped to hire a staff someday. “We planned that we might have to do this for a year, but hopefully it won’t be that long.”

The couple say they have been heartened by support from their customers, who tend to be young and arty. Some work in restaurants and bring them free food. Others have asked for the store’s business cards to hand out to friends. They say customers want the store to succeed because it is one of few places they can find clothing from labels like Sex Pot Revenge, Angelic Pretty and Victorian Maiden.

The couple were just about to close up around 8 p.m. when Cliff Cage, 30, who works at VampireFreaks, a Gothic store on Avenue A, came by with a group of D.J. friends to say that the Williamses could place their fliers — once they make them — in his store.

Admiring a black coat trimmed in fur and pompoms, Jared Helfer, 26, a legal assistant, promised to bring his girlfriend back. “This is stuff she’d live on,” he said.

416 2009-12-12 Contrary to James Hansen’s claim, the 1990 Clean Air Act has been the most successful environmental law in this nation’s history. By using a flexible, market-based approach, we have essentially solved the problem of acid rain — meeting the program’s targets three years ahead of schedule and at a fraction of the expected costs.

The “offset” provisions in climate legislation that he attacks will help save tropical rainforests while making more ambitious reductions affordable. And if anyone benefits most directly from the House bill, it is American families. The legislation sends over 40 percent of the monetary value of allowances (roughly $600 billion in present value through 2050) to households.

A declining cap on heat-trapping gases is the surest way to tackle climate change. Cap and trade rewards businesses that find better and cheaper ways to cut emissions — and holds those who don’t accountable for their emissions. It unleashes an unending search for innovations that will drive costs down over time. It has worked brilliantly in solving acid rain. Let’s get to work on solving climate change.

 New York, Dec. 8, 2009

James Hansen correctly identifies numerous shortcomings with cap and trade, the complex regulatory approach to addressing greenhouse gases.

We need only look at the failure of corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards to see that government regulations are inevitably subject to manipulation and unintended consequences in which the regulated entities outwit and outmaneuver the static regulation. Hence, despite cranking down the CAFE standards, sport utility vehicles flourished, reducing overall fuel efficiency.

The carbon tax proposed by Mr. Hansen would preclude such machinations and unintended consequences. It would allow the markets to determine which uses of carbon provide value sufficient to warrant the real cost of releasing that carbon into the atmosphere. The marketplace would replace those uses failing to provide adequate value with alternative, nonpolluting options.

Your juxtaposed articles on Monday, “Cap and Fade,” by James Hansen, and “An Affordable Truth,” by Paul Krugman, leave anyone with a layperson’s knowledge of economics and science perplexed. I want to believe in Mr. Krugman’s optimism about cap and trade, but Mr. Hansen apparently views it as smoke and mirrors. Yet the latter’s article raises more questions than it answers.

Mr. Hansen acknowledges the 43 percent reduction in sulfur emissions as a result of a cap-and-trade system, but he does not explain clearly why he says that is not a success. Additionally, his attacks on cap and trade lead one to ask whether the answer is to reduce the cap and close the loopholes (like grandfathering) rather than to jump to a new model that may have just as many loopholes.

In “An Affordable Truth,” Paul Krugman gave the White House his full support for passing cap and trade legislation. But “Russia’s Carbon Credits Seen as Barriers to Warming Curb” (news article, Dec. 8) shows that cap and trade simply will not work in today’s carbon market.

Cap and trade is based on companies’ having to buy carbon credits to minimize carbon emissions. The collapse of the heavy industry in Russia will prove to be the system’s fatal flaw as the carbon credits previously owned by Russia will flood the world market, sending the price close to zero.

It will be more cost-effective for companies to continue or even increase current emissions and pay the negligible price of carbon credits. In effect, Russia has turned into the low-emissions vehicle allowing the rest of the world to continue functioning as the S.U.V., to use James Hansen’s analogy.

In James Hansen’s Op-Ed essay (“Cap and Fade”) and Paul Krugman’s column (“An Affordable Truth”), a false dichotomy appeared. It does not have to be cap and trade versus carbon tax. There can be both: price controls within cap and trade. Price controls, like a price ceiling and a price floor within a cap-and-trade scheme, can be put into effect.

The government guarantees to either buy or sell permits at the desired price controls. For example, a price floor addresses Mr. Hansen’s point about the possibility that the market price for emissions collapses. A price floor also sustains an incentive for firms to innovate in low-emission technologies. A price ceiling limits the price volatility. On the other hand, letting price fluctuate in the allowable price band allows for a firmer emissions cap.

In my research I have concluded that if innovation incentives are taken into account, as firms become better in reducing their carbon emissions, a cap-and-trade scheme works better than a carbon tax in the long run.

But in the meantime we need price controls within cap and trade, which is really Krugman + Hansen.

The writer is an assistant professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University.

James Hansen’s conclusion that a carbon fee is superior to a carbon cap-and-trade system rests on the assumption that the government can accurately set carbon fees to achieve a desired level of emission reductions.

Setting this fee requires a precise understanding of how a range of industries will react to new carbon costs. It is unclear how Mr. Hansen expects the government to do this once, let alone repeatedly in response to economic changes.

Economic downturns naturally result in lower emission levels. Unless the government could quickly change its carbon fee levels, these fees would probably stifle economic growth during a recession.

Cap and trade avoids this problem by setting an emissions limit and allowing supply and demand to determine the appropriate carbon price. A market for allowances would automatically respond to changes in economic conditions by adjusting the carbon price, while still maintaining the predetermined emissions cap.

417 2009-12-12 PARIS — The Dutch financial services group ING, which came close to collapse last year, said Friday that it would repay half of the 10 billion euros, or $14.6 billion, provided by the government during the height of the financial crisis.

The bank joins other lenders in Europe and the United States, like UBS of Switzerland and Bank of America, in repaying at least some government funds earlier than had been expected.

The Dutch state provided the funds to ING in October 2008 by purchasing nonvoting preferred shares. ING also received state guarantees for 21.6 billion euros ($31.8 billion) worth of assets related to mortgages in the United States this year.

The repayment, planned for later this month, is part of ING’s efforts to reinvent itself as a better-focused financial business. Under pressure from European authorities, it is planning to divest itself of its insurance operations and sell its asset management operations.

“There’s a huge and much-needed restructuring going on” said Manfred Jakob, an analyst at SEB in Frankfurt. “ING will emerge as a more specialized and leaner company.”

The bank’s shares closed 1.6 percent higher Friday at 6.12 euros ($8.93) in Amsterdam.

The announcement was made as European leaders, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, were advocating a tax on banker bonuses.

ING has already agreed that top executives will not get bonuses this year. Last year, it paid 300 million euros ($438 million) in bonuses, according to Frans Middendorff, an ING spokesman.
418 2009-12-12 We didn’t expect much from the first week of the conference in . Countries need to do a little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk from seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.

The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.

That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China’s absence would give other developing countries — and the — an excuse to do less than needed.

’s recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on Tuesday, in a surprising show of defensiveness, China’s top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested with the industrialized countries and jumped on the , and the for not being aggressive enough. Another Chinese official urged Washington to do “some deep soul-searching” and improve its proposal.

Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions in many industrialized countries peaking or declining, just about all of the growth in greenhouse gases is expected to come from the developing world between now and 2030, half from China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply, Mr. Stern said, but “there is no way to solve this problem by giving the major developing countries a pass.”
419 2009-12-12 Terra Firma, the British private equity firm, sued Citigroup on Friday, accusing the bank of fraud in its handling of the 2007 sale of the music publisher EMI.

In its complaint, filed in New York State Supreme Court, Terra Firma says that it was essentially tricked into paying £4 billion, or $6.5 billion, for EMI in May 2007, near the height of the private equity boom. The private equity firm and its chairman, Guy Hands, have since been criticized for paying too high a price for the music publisher only months before the credit markets began to implode.

Citigroup has also been criticized for lending billions of pounds to the deal — a loan it was unable to resell as planned when the debt markets faltered.

Terra Firma and Citigroup have since been locked in a struggle over control of EMI. Many analysts have speculated that the most likely outcome for EMI, which has lost prominent artists like Radiohead, is a fire sale to a rival like the Warner Music Group, perhaps as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.

The case seeks to cast a spotlight on some of the more questionable elements of the gilded age of private equity deals, notably the frequency of banks both advising sellers and providing financing for their takeovers. Terra Firma said in its lawsuit that Citigroup reaped about £92.5 million ($150.2 million) in the deal.
420 2009-12-12 United Technologies said it had agreed to acquire a 49.5 percent stake in Clipper Windpower, a struggling California-based turbine maker, for $270 million to expand in alternative energy sources. Clipper began to look for investors earlier this year as customers delayed turbine orders while defects in some older turbines needed repairs. United Technologies said the deal, which was announced Wednesday, “allows U.T.C. to expand its power generation portfolio and enter the high-growth wind power segment.” Stock in United Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., rose $1.47, or 2 percent, to $69.40 a share.
421 2009-12-12 A jailed hedge fund manager in New York whose fraud was revealed in the investigation of the Bernard L. Madoff scandal admitted in court on Friday that he fabricated client account statements and overstated asset values by hundreds of millions of dollars. The former manager, James Nicholson, the former president of Westgate Capital Management, pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Manhattan to securities fraud, investment adviser fraud and wire fraud. Federal prosecutors estimated losses of $133 million.

Mr. Nicholson, 43, told the judge that he created fictitious account statements for more than 250 clients, many of them suburban residents of New York and New Jersey. He said most of the misrepresentations were made after the collapse in September 2008 of Lehman Brothers Holdings, in which his funds were invested. He faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison.
422 2009-12-12 A federal appeals court upheld most counts in a judicial corruption scandal, but threw out bribery convictions against an ex-lawyer, Paul Minor, and two former judges, John Whitfield and Wes Teel. Prosecutors said Mr. Minor had orchestrated a scheme in which he guaranteed loans for the judges, then used cash and third parties to pay off the loans. They, in turn, were accused of ruling in his favor in civil cases. They will be resentenced on the remaining fraud convictions.
423 2009-12-12 The University of California has agreed to hire an independent auditor as part of a dispute with a former dean at the medical school in San Francisco. The move came after a United States senator accused school officials this week of mismanaging research money and making misleading statements to state legislators.

The university gave the dean, Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the federal Food and Drug Administration, documents describing its financial condition upon his hiring in 2003.

But Dr. Kessler found that the medical school was in far worse financial shape than he had been led to believe, according to Congressional investigators. Dr. Kessler claimed that his efforts to confirm the true nature of the school’s financial condition and to improve its financial controls led to his firing in 2007.

University officials have said that they had dealt honestly with Dr. Kessler and that the school was never in financial trouble, and they have pointed to an audit by the accounting firm KPMG and an internal report as confirming their positions.

But an investigation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, found that the KPMG audit was too limited to confirm the school’s version of events, and that a member of the committee that created the internal report never saw the final report.

As a result, Mr. Grassley said in a letter this week that university officials appeared “to provide misleading statements to the California State Senate.”
424 2009-12-12 J.J. Abrams, a writer, director and executive producer of the hit television shows “Lost” and “Alias” as well as director of the latest “Star Trek” movie, said he was close to a deal with Colum McCann to adapt his novel “Let the Great World Spin” for a movie. The novel, which won the National Book Award for fiction, is a sprawling epic about lives in 1970s New York that are touched by a daredevil tightrope walk between the Twin Towers. Mr. McCann, at right, who is from Ireland, said he would work with Mr. Abrams to develop the screenplay. “Hopefully we’re going to get a little cottage in the west of Ireland and go hang out for a while and work out a structure for the film,” he said. "And then I’ll go away and write it.”
425 2009-12-12 Apple sued the cellphone maker Nokia Corporation on Friday for patent infringement, a countermove to Nokia’s earlier suit against technologies used in Apple’s iPhone.

Apple’s lawsuit claims Nokia is infringing 13 of Apple’s patents and says the company chose to “copy the iPhone,” especially its user interface, to make up for its declining share of the high-end phone market.

Nokia’s lawsuit, filed in October, claims that Apple infringes 10 of its patents covering both phone calls and Wi-Fi access.

The patents that Apple claims Nokia is infringing deal with, among other things: connecting a phone to a computer, teleconferencing, menus on a touch screen, power conservation in chips and “pattern and color abstraction in a graphical user interface.” The company also denies Nokia’s claims of patent infringement.

In a statement, Nokia said it would review the claims and respond “in due course.”

Apple said Nokia fell behind in the smartphone market because it chose to focus on old-fashioned cellphones with conventional user interfaces.

Countersuits are a staple of patent litigation, which often ends in cross-licensing agreements. Nokia said in October that 40 phone manufacturers, but not Apple, had licensed the patents at issue in its lawsuit.
426 2009-12-12 With his sharp suits and roster of famous clients, Mr. Simels joined the ranks of the city’s elite defense lawyers long ago, even as his abrasive nature set him apart. A son of the Bronx who came late to fatherhood, he had no time for bar associations and lawyers’ clubs, but plenty for his children, whom he doted on. He prepared for trials as if an empire were at stake, and even wrote one chapter, called “Cross Until They Drop,” for a book on various issues involving cross-examination. He rarely left legwork to investigators, saying he craved “eye contact” with sources.

“He had arrogance, and he pushed the envelope,” said Ronald Rubinstein, a lawyer who worked with Mr. Simels on several cases. “He was a warrior, and that’s why I like him. He served a lot of clients well.”

In a telephone interview in the wake of his sentencing, Mr. Simels spoke quietly about his accomplishments and declined to name any regrets. Citing a pending appeal, he also refused to discuss the case that led to his ruin.

He had always been very good at something.

In high school, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., it had been sports. Mr. Simels, an A student, played outfield on a team that included future major-leaguers, including Ken Singleton.

He was the president of his college fraternity and flirted with a career in medicine. After a stint in Missouri training in the Army Reserves, Mr. Simels returned to New York to start law school. The career made perfect sense. He was barely a teenager when he read his first law book, given to him by his mother’s cousin, a civil lawyer. “He had such exuberance about the law and jurisprudence,” Mr. Simels said.

In 1974, he went to work for one of the city’s legal stars, Maurice H. Nadjari, the state’s special prosecutor, newly appointed to investigate the rampant corruption in the criminal justice system at the time.

Mr. Nadjari was a controversial figure, seen as a loner and a zealous prosecutor, with little talent for self-preservation.

“He was the best boss anyone could ask for,” Mr. Simels said. “I think he was misperceived by many.”

The two shared many traits.

Richard A. Nachman, who headed the Manhattan bureau where Mr. Simels worked, said of his employee: “He was quite an aggressive young fellow — sometimes, I felt, overaggressive. If he saw a case that involved someone of some importance, he would leap at that and go to work. I don’t say that in a derogatory way.”

Mr. Pickelle, his fellow prosecutor, said he never saw a hint of unethical behavior from Mr. Simels. “Nadjari would have killed him,” he said.

Mr. Simels left the prosecutor’s office in 1979 to start his own defense practice — “It was just time to go,” he said — and within a year, he took on the case of Henry Hill, the mobster turned government informant. Mr. Simels was picked, in part, because he had no clients tied to organized crime, and representing Mr. Hill, whose life was the basis of the film “Goodfellas,” meant he never would.

Instead, he became well known for representing clients charged in drug cases, and for recurring questions about his ethics.

In 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit took up the question of whether Mr. Simels, by visiting a witness in jail who might have testified against his client — without notifying the witness’s lawyer — deserved censure.

He did not, the judges concluded, finding that Mr. Simels was “engaging in critical pretrial investigation.”

But in another case, a former client named Thomas Mickens, a convicted cocaine dealer, said that Mr. Simels had kept a government plea offer from him in order to keep getting paid. A judge found that Mr. Simels had not passed along the offer. Some of his peers said they wondered whether the steady diet of clients who were drug dealers had taken a toll on Mr. Simels.

And in a letter of support to Judge Gleeson, Joel Cohen, who was a fellow prosecutor with Mr. Simels in the 1970s, noted Mr. Simels’s isolation — he had never taken a law partner. Mr. Cohen should have been a better friend, he wrote, if only to provide a second opinion “when his faithfulness to the call of duty cried out particularly loudly from society’s reprobates.”

He was referring to clients like Shaheed Khan, a Guyanese drug trafficker whom Mr. Simels started representing with his trademark zeal in 2006. In court testimony, it emerged that Mr. Khan, the head of a paramilitary group in Guyana called the Phantom Squad, had killed several of his rivals with the help of a man named Selwyn Vaughn.

Mr. Simels met with Mr. Vaughn, believing he was still a loyal member of Mr. Khan’s organization. But he had become a government cooperator, and he was wearing a wire.

On recordings, Mr. Simels told Mr. Vaughn to put “as much pressure” as possible on a witness, as long as he did not kill the witness’s mother.

“If they think that he had something to do with the harm of a witness,” Mr. Simels said, referring to Mr. Khan, “it takes us twice as long to get in to see him, so, you know, be mindful of that.” He told Mr. Vaughn to promise another witness $10,000, and gave Mr. Vaughn a script for the witness’s testimony.

In September 2008, Mr. Simels and a young associate, Arienne Irving, were arrested on charges including witness tampering and bribery. Judge Gleeson later threw out the case against Ms. Irving. Mr. Simels hired a top defense lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, to defend him.

But the evidence that he left behind, a long trail of e-mail and instant messages seized from his computer, amounted to a strange lapse for a former prosecutor.

And for a tactician who could teach a clinic on how to cross-examine a witness, Mr. Simels stumbled badly when he took the stand, giving cagey answers.

A prosecutor, Steven L. D’Allesandro, asked him: “If a person offers a witness money, $5,000 or $10,000 or $20,000 for their testimony, that is a crime, yes or no.”

Mr. Simels answered, “I would assume it would be.”

Judge Gleeson warned Mr. Simels from the bench: “Your career is at stake,” he said. “Your liberty is at stake.”

A jury deliberated for two weeks before convicting him.

Some of Mr. Simels’s supporters said that he was misunderstood, that the words he used in the recordings reflected the street vernacular routinely employed by defense lawyers.

Judge Gleeson left little doubt what he thought. “Mr. Simels crossed a bright line,” he said. “He just lost his bearings in such a fundamental way.”
427 2009-12-12 Ann Kansfield, who runs a weekly food pantry at the Greenpoint Reformed Church in Brooklyn, cannot bring herself to tell you this, so I will: She doesn’t want your cans. As uncharitable as it sounds, she doesn’t want your holiday food drives.

Don’t be offended. She knows you are well meaning; just misguided, perhaps misinformed. Cans of food are for eating, or, if past their “best if used by” date, for discarding but not ideal for donating.

Pastor Kansfield does not want the cans of water chestnuts and mandarin oranges that food drive donors from Park Slope seem keen on leaving. Nor can she use, thank you very much, the bottle of bloody mary mix that someone donated months ago, given that many of her clients have a complicated relationship with alcohol.

Food drives are an annual holiday tradition, as ubiquitous as eggnog but, it turns out, about as welcome in some corners as fruitcake. Pastor Ann, as she prefers to be called, does not want your cans because she, like you, hates waste, and she, like you, wants to feed hungry people.

Maybe you, or your church or synagogue or school or local bar or softball team, think that a can drive is the best way to combat waste: Surely someone should benefit from that coconut milk that is gathering dust on the bottom shelf? But there’s a better way.

It’s called the Food Bank for New York City, the prime source that Pastor Kansfield relies on for her Thursday afternoon food giveaways, which start at 3, though the line forms at 10 a.m. The Food Bank buys wholesale or fields bulk donations when a brand logo changes or the giving spirit hits some boardroom, and delivers to soup kitchens and food pantries. The Food Bank pays attention to nutrition and knows about needs: No bloody mary mix, for example.

At the Food Bank, $50 could buy 200 boxes of cereal, Pastor Kansfield explained, as opposed to perhaps the 10 that donors to food drives could get for that much. She is moved by the generosity, the can-do impulse that propels local food drives, but is overwhelmed, as would be most small nonprofits, by the logistics.

“While the good deeds people want to do are heavenly, the inadvertent waste and the wasted money  they’re of the devil,” she said. Instead of collecting food, she urges those who ask: please collect money, and then give it to her food pantry for things she really needs (like garbage bags and a new sink) or to the Food Bank.

Not everyone is quite so averse to cans. Some in the hunger business point out that for many people, a can is all they can give. It might be something they paid for long ago, or they might be too embarrassed to write a check for the $2.79 they would spend adding an extra can of soup to their grocery cart.

“I’m never going to say no to a food drive, because every little bit counts,” said Mireille Massac, who runs a food pantry in Bedford-Stuyvesant. “But for those communities who can give more, I’d always prefer funds. What can I really do with 300 different kinds of cans?”

The Food Bank’s Web site offers all sorts of resources and encouragement on how to organize food drives. But why? “Food drives open the door to many other opportunities to work with us,” said Lisa Jakobsberg, the Food Bank’s senior director of communications and marketing  opportunities, she said, like an online fund-raising drive so the Food Bank can buy more in bulk.

Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, also encourages people to give money, not cans  and not just to organizations that distribute food, but to those that do outreach to enroll people who qualify for food stamps, or to those that advocate more aggressively at the policy level to solve the problem of hunger.

“People need to understand just how minimal and humiliating charitable food-giving is as a response to the problem,” Mr. Berg said. “Food drives account for less than 10 percent of all the food that’s given away.”

Yes, there is something satisfying about the “thunk” of a can in a brightly wrapped collection bin, something wonderful about the idea of taking a tin from your pantry that you don’t need and bringing it to Pastor Kansfield for someone who does. It’s something your kid can see and hold, unlike a donation that seems to evaporate into electronic ether.

But if we read online, flirt online, shop online, surely we could take satisfaction in giving online? So unless you are flat broke or want to be the group that the Food Bank is hoping will start with cans and end up virtual, or the one giving the people who run your local food pantry a headache, kick the can: Click “donate” and organize your friends to do the same.

And as for that old can of beans, make a pot of chili for a friend who has just been laid off or is laid up or just had a baby.
428 2009-12-12 Present-day practitioners of Tango Nuevo, the modernist strain of Argentine tango, face a benign but persistent quandary. Call it the Piazzolla Problem: a need to acknowledge the work of Astor Piazzolla, who spearheaded the genre, without being subsumed by his shadow.

The pianist Pablo Ziegler — a Piazzolla sideman throughout the 1980s, the composer’s last working decade — has handled this negotiation better than most over the years. But that doesn’t mean he has earned an exemption from its demands.

Mr. Ziegler is the steadfast headliner of the Tango Meets Jazz Festival, an event produced by Pat Philips and Ettore Stratta that is in its seventh year at Jazz Standard. A percussive, demonstrative pianist, he has a rigorous command of harmony and a knack for steel-girded ornamentation.

He also has a considerable cache of his own compositions in the Tango Nuevo lineage. Some of them appear on an excellent acoustic trio album, “Buenos Aires Report” (Zoho), issued in 2007.

That album’s title track was a high point of Mr. Ziegler’s first set on Thursday night, along with “La Fundición,” another bustling original. Both pieces foreground the modern-jazz affinities that Mr. Ziegler, more than Piazzolla, places near the center of his style. His band mates — Héctor del Curto on bandoneón, Claudio Ragazzi on electric guitar and Pedro Giraudo on upright bass — infused their parts with a crisp vitality.

And as with every Tango Meets Jazz Festival, there was a compatible jazz interloper: in this case, Miguel Zenón, an astute young alto saxophonist with his own notions of folkloric innovation. “Esta Plena,” released this year on Marsalis Music, deftly synthesizes folk traditions from his native Puerto Rico.
429 2009-12-12 Federal prosecutors want to delay civil litigation against one of Bernard L. Madoff’s largest investors until a “parallel criminal investigation” is resolved, according to court documents filed on Friday.

If the request is granted, it would postpone for six months a civil case filed in Manhattan in June by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Stanley Chais, a retired Hollywood business manager and philanthropist who was one of the earliest investors in Mr. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme.

The government’s request filed in Manhattan is the first public confirmation of a criminal investigation involving one of the large conduit funds through which thousands of people invested indirectly with Mr. Madoff over the years.

With about $1 billion invested, the three partnerships Mr. Chais set up were not the largest of these “feeder funds.” That status belongs to Fairfield Sentry, a $7 billion fund set up by the Fairfield Greenwich Group.

But the Chais partnerships are the oldest of the feeder funds. The earliest one, the Lambeth Company, was formed in 1970, just a decade after Mr. Madoff, at age 22, set up the brokerage firm that was his legitimate face on Wall Street.

The legal brief supporting the prosecutors’ request said they expected to decide by mid-June whether to present evidence to a grand jury and seek an indictment against Mr. Chais, who is 83 and being treated for leukemia.

Besides investing his own fortune with Mr. Madoff, Mr. Chais set up more than four dozen Madoff accounts for his children and grandchildren, in addition to the partnerships through which nonfamily members invested.

The S.E.C. sued Mr. Chais in June, contending that he steered clients’ money to Mr. Madoff  and collected hundreds of millions of dollars in management fees  “despite having clear indications that Madoff was conducting a fraud.”

Eugene R. Licker, a lawyer for Mr. Chais, released a statement on Friday noting that his client had “consented to the government’s expected and routine motions to intervene.”

“The supporting papers say nothing more than was set forth in the S.E.C. complaint, which Mr. Chais has denied,” he said. “The government, of course, feels compelled to investigate, and we are confident that the investigations will support Mr. Chais’s denials of any wrongdoing.”

Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty to fraud in March and is serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina.

In a letter to the court on Friday, William J. Stellmach, an assistant United States attorney, said that the S.E.C. had also agreed to delay its litigation.

He said that the delay was necessary “to protect the substantial public interests at stake in a substantially related, overlapping criminal investigation.”

Mr. Stellmach said the criminal investigation focuses on “whether Chais and others” engaged in conspiracy, securities fraud and money laundering.
430 2009-12-12 MOSCOW — President Dmitri A. Medvedev has dismissed the head of the Moscow prisons and numerous other prison administrators in response to the death of a lawyer in pretrial detention, officials said on Friday.

The lawyer, Sergei L. Magnitsky, had been ensnared in a feud between an international investment fund, Hermitage Capital Management, and the Russian law enforcement authorities, and his defenders said his death last month showed that the country’s criminal justice system was severely troubled.

Mr. Magnitsky died of toxic shock and heart failure at a pretrial detention center in Moscow, and Mr. Medvedev reacted by ordering an inquiry into how Mr. Magnitsky was treated and into the quality of medical care in the prison system.

Aleksandr Reymer, director of the prison system, said in a radio interview on Friday that the head of the Moscow division, Vladimir Davydov, had been ousted.

Mr. Reymer said Mr. Magnitsky’s death spurred an inquiry into medical care in the prison system that found “violations of our requirements” and resulted in the dismissal of several top officials.
431 2009-12-12 BAGHDAD — Iraq’s government sold development rights to two of its largest untapped oil fields at a public auction held under extraordinary security on Friday, three days after a series of coordinated bombings killed more than 100 people here in the capital.

A partnership of Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas, a state-owned Malaysian company, won the larger field, Majnoon, in southern Iraq, which contains an estimated 12.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil.

The second field, Halfiya, also in the south, was won by a consortium led by China National Petroleum Company that included Petronas and Total of France. It is believed to hold some 4.1 billion barrels.

The auction, the second since the 2003 invasion, attracted representatives of dozens of the world’s largest oil companies, including ExxonMobil, British Petroleum and Russia’s Lukoil. “I was nervous when I was sitting there,” said Mounir Bouaziz, a vice president at Shell, after he submitted the winning bid for the Majnoon field. “We are pleased and relieved to have won this. It has taken a lot of work to get this, including months and months of study and discussions.”

The event, shown on Iraq’s state-owned television channel, was held in the Oil Ministry under security tight by even Baghdad’s heavily policed standards. Helicopters circled overhead; thousands of police officers and soldiers patrolled roadways; streets within a mile of the ministry were closed to all vehicles but the convoys of armored S.U.V.’s ferrying oil executives; and everyone who made it inside was subjected to body searches.
432 2009-12-12 Ms. Mason certainly needs the coverage. Her medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and chronic bronchitis would add up to hundreds of dollars a month without insurance.

“I’ve tried to scrape some money together to take care of things when the Cobra subsidy ends, but it’s just not enough,” Ms. Mason said.

That government subsidy made Cobra a lot more affordable for millions of unemployed people like Ms. Mason. But now that the subsidy is ending for the first of its recipients, many don’t know where to turn. What is more, the way the stimulus act is written, the subsidy will no longer be available to any newly laid-off workers.

According to a report recently released by Families USA, a nonprofit health care advocacy group, Cobra premiums for family health coverage will cost laid-off workers, on average, $1,111 a month, which is almost 84 percent of the average monthly unemployment check those families receive.

In nine states — including Alaska, Arizona, Mississippi and Florida — full Cobra benefits exceed the amount of the average unemployment check, according to the report.

That is why the Cobra subsidy has been so important and why there is a big push in Congress to extend the benefit. Bills were introduced recently in the House and the Senate that would extend the subsidy for six months. Unemployed workers who have lost their subsidy would probably be grandfathered under the legislation and receive a refund for any unsubsidized premiums they pay before the legislation is enacted.

If those bills do not move forward, many experts predict that a Cobra extension will become part of the pending jobs bill, which would extend many of the benefits provided by the stimulus package, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA.

President Obama seemed to confirm that prediction during a news conference on Tuesday when he called for an extension of emergency assistance to the elderly, unemployment insurance benefits, Cobra and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs.

Of course, if your Cobra subsidy is ending in the very near future, all the promises in the world from Washington will not help you pay your premiums in the meantime. So, until there is some definitive action from Capitol Hill, here is what you need to do.

AVOID A LAPSE When your subsidy ends, you won’t get a lot of notice. Most likely you will simply receive your next Cobra bill in the mail for a much larger amount than you are accustomed to paying.

Our advice: Pay it, no matter how much you have to scrimp and borrow.

If you do not, your Cobra coverage will end immediately. And then the clock immediately starts ticking on interruption of your health care coverage.

Under current law, if you have a gap in coverage of 63 days or longer, any insurance carrier from which you might then seek coverage could use any pre-existing health care issues you may have — like back spasms or heart disease — as a reason to deny coverage or charge astronomical premiums , far above even the expensive Cobra payments.

BUY TIME Yes, the full-price Cobra payments are onerous. But if you pay the first month or two, you will be buying time to see if the subsidy is extended and time to shop around for health insurance alternatives that may be more affordable.

Check ehealthinsurance.com and healthplanone.com for general pricing information from carriers that provide individual policies in your area.

STAY ON TOP OF IT If you’re making the switch to full payments, be sure to keep in touch with your Cobra administrator so you will know if Congress grants an extension, and what, if anything, you need to do to get it.

Depending on your plan and situation, this person may be a staff member of your former employer’s benefits department. Or it may be someone at the insurance company providing your Cobra coverage, or a third-party administrator. Be sure to read through your paperwork and find the person you need to stay in contact with.

LOOK FOR REDUCTIONS With or without the subsidy, family Cobra coverage costs much more than individual coverage or coverage for just you and your spouse.

Without your regular income, your children may well be eligible for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. It covers children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health insurance. If you can insure your kids through CHIP, Mr. Pollack said, you can significantly reduce your Cobra payment. For more information go to insurekidsnow.gov.

NEWLY LAID OFF? If you have been laid off this month and your employer has promised to cover your health care until the end of December, beware: that magnanimity could work against you.

The way the law is written, workers are eligible for the subsidy only if they are “eligible for Cobra” before Dec. 31, said Kathryn Bakich, national health care compliance director for the Segal Company, a benefits consultant. And simply being laid off in December does not necessarily make you eligible, particularly if your employer-provided coverage is extended through the end of the year.

If you have already received a pink slip this month, or you get one, Ms. Bakich suggests contacting your benefits department immediately to see if there is any way your Cobra eligibility can begin this calendar year.
433 2009-12-12 Mr. Eide, who oversees about 1,000 international staff members in Afghanistan, was prompted to acknowledge his decision publicly after Reuters and some European newspapers reported that the United Nations and Western governments were already searching for a replacement.

“I had said already at the outset that I would stay for two years,” Mr. Eide said in an e-mailed statement to The New York Times. He was appointed in March 2008.

“I have now reconfirmed that position and that I do not intend to renew my contract when it comes to an end,” he said. “It is therefore not a question of resignation, but of sticking to the decision I made two years ago. My predecessors stayed for the same period of time.”

In an interview with the Norwegian news agency N.T.B. on Friday, Mr. Eide also said that “there is no drama attached to this” and denied that the conflict with Mr. Galbraith had played any part in his decision.

“I am aware that many people would make a connection between these two events,” Mr. Eide said, according to the N.T.B. reporter who interviewed him on Friday. But “this disagreement has been blown out of proportion.”

Possible successors for the job include Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a career diplomat from France, and Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, head of the United Nations mission in Iraq from 2007 to 2009.

In recent weeks, according to some Western and Afghan officials, Mr. Eide had been leading efforts to delay the Afghan parliamentary elections scheduled for May. Some Western diplomats fear that having elections so soon could prove a disastrous replay of the August vote.

Salih Muhammed Registani, a top aide to Mr. Abdullah during the presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Eide was “the initiator” of the move to delay the parliamentary ballot.

A Western official also said Mr. Eide believed that May would be too soon to hold the elections, and that he had received support from a number of Western governments. “Kai is not alone in this,” the official said.

Separately on Friday, the German defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, made a surprise visit to Afghanistan amid a growing controversy over the killing of more than 142 people, many of them civilians, in a NATO airstrike in September.

Mr. Guttenberg, who is coming under increasing criticism from opposition parties in Germany for failing to explain the circumstances behind the airstrike on Sept. 4, said he wanted to hear from German soldiers based in Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan, how the orders were given to call in the strike after two fuel tankers were hijacked by the Taliban. Mr. Guttenberg, who was appointed defense minister after German elections in September, also intends to explain the government’s position, his ministry said in a statement.

The episode has already cost the jobs of senior military officials. Last month, Mr. Guttenberg dismissed Germany’s top military officer, Gen. Wolfgang Schneiderhan, and a state secretary in the Defense Ministry, Peter Wichert. He said they had withheld information about the number of deaths and how the attack was carried out. When more details emerged, Franz Josef Jung, who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike, was forced to resign as labor minister.

Initial Defense Ministry reports said about 30 people had been killed. They did not mention civilian casualties.

The German government’s position on the episode has changed significantly in the past two weeks after the American-led NATO coalition published an internal report on what happened.

Mr. Guttenberg had said the attack on the two tankers was “definitely militarily appropriate.” But then last week, he said the attack had been “militarily inappropriate.” He explained this turnabout by saying he now had documents that had not been available to him earlier.
434 2009-12-12 BEIJING — Liu Xiaobo, one of China’s best-known dissidents and a principal author of a pro-democracy manifesto that has attracted more than 10,000 signatures from Chinese supporters, was indicted Thursday on charges of trying to subvert the state, his lawyer said.

Mr. Liu was expected to be tried in four to six weeks, the lawyer, Shang Baojun, said Friday.

The authorities disclosed the decision to prosecute Mr. Liu — a step that almost invariably ends in imprisonment — exactly one year and a day after the manifesto, Charter 08, was published. Other Charter 08 signers said in interviews that the government was using Mr. Liu’s case to send a strong message to Chinese intellectuals that it would not tolerate organized, independent efforts to foster democracy.

“The government is trying to tell us to stop trying to push for human rights and democracy in China,” said Xu Youyu, a Charter 08 signer and a philosophy professor who recently retired from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “Secondly, he has been the biggest threat inside of China, and they want to get rid of him.”

Mr. Liu’s supporters had hoped that Chinese leaders would be persuaded to release Mr. Liu, who has been detained for more than a year, when President Obama visited China last month. During the visit, United States officials gave Chinese leaders a list of “cases of concern” that included Mr. Liu and 11 other political and religious activists who are imprisoned or facing charges, according to Nicholas Bequelin, an Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York.

Mr. Xu said: “I think the message to the outside world is, it doesn’t really matter to the government how this case is viewed by the international community. It can do whatever it wants.”
435 2009-12-12 “The goal is not to hold a street demonstration, but to make it to the targets and disrupt them,” a copy of the instructions read.

A heavy police presence could be seen at a number of the potential targets, and police helicopters could be seen moving across various parts of the city.

As of 2 p.m. local time, 68 arrests had been made, a police spokeswoman said.

Agnes Galube, 26, was among several protesters handcuffed at Kampmannsgade and Vester Sogade Streets. She said she was being detained for having paint cans in her bag, though she added that they were empty and that protesters were using them as rattles.

Per Larsen, chief coordinator for the Danish police, called the protesters’ plans “a very well-planned operation.”

But, he added, “You have never seen such a police presence in this city before. I think we will have things under control.”

He said the police had received only one report of vandalism — a broken storefront window.

A standoff took place at the east end of Queen Louise Bridge, where protesters tried to crose Peblinge Lake and move closer to the city center. The police surrounded the crowd at the bridge while other demonstrators shouted, “Our climate is not your business!”

Police dogs were brought to the scene to move the crowds back, and the police made a handful of arrests before everyone scattered. Some protesters could be heard shouting that the police were being unnecessarily aggressive.

But Mr. Larsen said the complaints were unfounded.

“Of course we have spoiled a little bit of their plans, but the meaning of their action today was to try to damage their targets, and so we’ve prevented that,” he said.

Michael Christian Storgaard, a spokesman for Maersk, a major shipping company that has its headquarters in Copenhagen, said that employees had been warned this week to expect potential demonstrations.

“In an internal message, we have advised our employees that we may have to close the access to and from the building during these demonstrations,” Mr. Storgaard said in an e-mail message. “Apart from that we have not taken any more drastic precautions.”

On Wednesday, the police seized nearly 200 makeshift shields, scores of paint bombs and other equipment, including nine platforms with crude staircases, during a raid on a building that city officials had provided as free housing for activists visiting Copenhagen during the climate talks.The police said they believed that the demonstrators intended to use the stairs to vault over barricades outside the conference center, and the shields to protect themselves.

“It tells us that we are facing a group of people who are ready to use civil disobedience and that they are ready to do vandalism,” Mr. Larsen said Wednesday.

On Saturday, a march is planned from the city center to the United Nations meeting place.
436 2009-12-12 Mr. Sirawak is an employee of a Thai flight services company in Phnom Penh and was convicted of spying on Tuesday after passing on flight details of Mr. Thaksin’s arrival on Nov. 10 to Thai diplomats. Mr. Thaksin remained in Cambodia for five days before leaving again for the undisclosed location where he has spent the past month.

“Thaksin is an adviser to Cambodia’s government, and Cambodia has the obligation to provide him security,” said Judge Ke Sakhan of Municipal Court in sentencing Mr. Siwarak. Mr. Siwarak said in court that he had seen the flight schedule and passed on the information to a Thai diplomat, First Secretary Kamrob Palawatwichai, who was later expelled from the country. But Mr. Siwarak denied stealing the document.

In the tense diplomatic atmosphere between the nations, his arrest and conviction have been treated as major news on both sides of the border. After Mr. Thaksin’s visit, both nations recalled their ambassadors and threatened economic sanctions on each other.

The friction appears in part to be personal, with the tough former Khmer Rouge soldier, Mr. Hun Sen, clearly at odds with Thailand’s Eton-and-Oxford educated prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva.

“I’m not the enemy of the Thai people,” Mr. Hun Sen said after Mr. Siwarak was arrested. “But the prime minister and the foreign minister, these two people look down on Cambodia. Cambodia will have no happiness as long as this group is in power in Thailand.” He called on Cambodian government institutions to review bilateral agreements “so that we will not owe any favors to Abhisit and their government.”

Apparently addressing Mr. Abhisit, he added, “We may be poor, but we would rather shed our blood than let you look down on us.”

Although the situation has eased in recent months, blood has in fact been shed in brief skirmishes along the border where the two nations have posted troops near a disputed 11th-century temple, Preah Vihear.

Mr. Abhisit made a characteristically low-key response to Mr. Hun Sen’s remarks, saying Thailand did not plan to cancel any of its contracts with Cambodia and that “if Mr. Hun Sen refuses to receive any aid or cooperation from Thailand, the decision is his own.”

For his part, Mr. Thaksin addressed about 17,000 supporters Thursday evening in his latest video speech from an undisclosed location, continuing his campaign to undermine the government and maintain his domestic power base. “Return democracy to the people, return wealth to the people and dignity to the country,” he said in a familiar rallying cry.
437 2009-12-12 The University of California has agreed to hire an independent auditor as part of a dispute with a former dean at the medical school in San Francisco. The move came after a United States senator accused school officials this week of mismanaging research money and making misleading statements to state legislators.

The university gave the dean, Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the federal Food and Drug Administration, documents describing its financial condition upon his hiring in 2003.

But Dr. Kessler found that the medical school was in far worse financial shape than he had been led to believe, according to Congressional investigators. Dr. Kessler claimed that his efforts to confirm the true nature of the school’s financial condition and to improve its financial controls led to his firing in 2007.

University officials have said that they had dealt honestly with Dr. Kessler and that the school was never in financial trouble, and they have pointed to an audit by the accounting firm KPMG and an internal report as confirming their positions.

But an investigation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, found that the KPMG audit was too limited to confirm the school’s version of events, and that a member of the committee that created the internal report never saw the final report.

As a result, Mr. Grassley said in a letter this week that university officials appeared “to provide misleading statements to the California State Senate.”
438 2009-12-12 “The goal is not to hold a street demonstration, but to make it to the targets and disrupt them,” a copy of the instructions read.

A heavy police presence could be seen at a number of the potential targets, and police helicopters could be seen moving across various parts of the city.

As of 2 p.m. local time, 68 arrests had been made, a police spokeswoman said.

Agnes Galube, 26, was among several protesters handcuffed at Kampmannsgade and Vester Sogade Streets. She said she was being detained for having paint cans in her bag, though she added that they were empty and that protesters were using them as rattles.

Per Larsen, chief coordinator for the Danish police, called the protesters’ plans “a very well-planned operation.”

But, he added, “You have never seen such a police presence in this city before. I think we will have things under control.”

He said the police had received only one report of vandalism — a broken storefront window.

A standoff took place at the east end of Queen Louise Bridge, where protesters tried to crose Peblinge Lake and move closer to the city center. The police surrounded the crowd at the bridge while other demonstrators shouted, “Our climate is not your business!”

Police dogs were brought to the scene to move the crowds back, and the police made a handful of arrests before everyone scattered. Some protesters could be heard shouting that the police were being unnecessarily aggressive.

But Mr. Larsen said the complaints were unfounded.

“Of course we have spoiled a little bit of their plans, but the meaning of their action today was to try to damage their targets, and so we’ve prevented that,” he said.

439 2009-12-12 Ms. Mason certainly needs the coverage. Her medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and chronic bronchitis would add up to hundreds of dollars a month without insurance.

“I’ve tried to scrape some money together to take care of things when the Cobra subsidy ends, but it’s just not enough,” Ms. Mason said.

That government subsidy made Cobra a lot more affordable for millions of unemployed people like Ms. Mason. But now that the subsidy is ending for the first of its recipients, many don’t know where to turn. What is more, the way the stimulus act is written, the subsidy will no longer be available to any newly laid-off workers.

According to a report recently released by Families USA, a nonprofit health care advocacy group, Cobra premiums for family health coverage will cost laid-off workers, on average, $1,111 a month, which is almost 84 percent of the average monthly unemployment check those families receive.

In nine states — including Alaska, Arizona, Mississippi and Florida — full Cobra benefits exceed the amount of the average unemployment check, according to the report.

That is why the Cobra subsidy has been so important and why there is a big push in Congress to extend the benefit. Bills were introduced recently in the House and the Senate that would extend the subsidy for six months. Unemployed workers who have lost their subsidy would probably be grandfathered under the legislation and receive a refund for any unsubsidized premiums they pay before the legislation is enacted.

If those bills do not move forward, many experts predict that a Cobra extension will become part of the pending jobs bill, which would extend many of the benefits provided by the stimulus package, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA.

President Obama seemed to confirm that prediction during a news conference on Tuesday when he called for an extension of emergency assistance to the elderly, unemployment insurance benefits, Cobra and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs.

Of course, if your Cobra subsidy is ending in the very near future, all the promises in the world from Washington will not help you pay your premiums in the meantime. So, until there is some definitive action from Capitol Hill, here is what you need to do.

AVOID A LAPSE When your subsidy ends, you won’t get a lot of notice. Most likely you will simply receive your next Cobra bill in the mail for a much larger amount than you are accustomed to paying.

Our advice: Pay it, no matter how much you have to scrimp and borrow.

If you do not, your Cobra coverage will end immediately. And then the clock immediately starts ticking on interruption of your health care coverage.

Under current law, if you have a gap in coverage of 63 days or longer, any insurance carrier from which you might then seek coverage could use any pre-existing health care issues you may have — like back spasms or heart disease — as a reason to deny coverage or charge astronomical premiums , far above even the expensive Cobra payments.

BUY TIME Yes, the full-price Cobra payments are onerous. But if you pay the first month or two, you will be buying time to see if the subsidy is extended and time to shop around for health insurance alternatives that may be more affordable.

Check ehealthinsurance.com and healthplanone.com for general pricing information from carriers that provide individual policies in your area.

STAY ON TOP OF IT If you’re making the switch to full payments, be sure to keep in touch with your Cobra administrator so you will know if Congress grants an extension, and what, if anything, you need to do to get it.

Depending on your plan and situation, this person may be a staff member of your former employer’s benefits department. Or it may be someone at the insurance company providing your Cobra coverage, or a third-party administrator. Be sure to read through your paperwork and find the person you need to stay in contact with.

LOOK FOR REDUCTIONS With or without the subsidy, family Cobra coverage costs much more than individual coverage or coverage for just you and your spouse.

Without your regular income, your children may well be eligible for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. It covers children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health insurance. If you can insure your kids through CHIP, Mr. Pollack said, you can significantly reduce your Cobra payment. For more information go to insurekidsnow.gov.

NEWLY LAID OFF? If you have been laid off this month and your employer has promised to cover your health care until the end of December, beware: that magnanimity could work against you.

The way the law is written, workers are eligible for the subsidy only if they are “eligible for Cobra” before Dec. 31, said Kathryn Bakich, national health care compliance director for the Segal Company, a benefits consultant. And simply being laid off in December does not necessarily make you eligible, particularly if your employer-provided coverage is extended through the end of the year.

If you have already received a pink slip this month, or you get one, Ms. Bakich suggests contacting your benefits department immediately to see if there is any way your Cobra eligibility can begin this calendar year.
440 2009-12-12 The Dutch financial services group ING, which came close to collapse last year, said Friday that it would repay half of the 10 billion euros, or $14.6 billion, provided by the government during the height of the financial crisis.      The bank joi...
441 2009-12-12 “The notion of a difference between Europe and United States remains relevant,” Mr. Leiken said. But the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the American operations like drone strikes in Pakistan, are fueling radicalization at home, he said.

“Just the length of U.S. involvement in these countries is provoking more Muslim Americans to react,” Mr. Leiken said.

Concern over the recent cases has profoundly affected Muslim organizations in the United States, which have renewed pledges to campaign against extremist thinking.

“Among leaders, there’s a recognition that there’s a challenge within our community that needs to be addressed,” said Alejandro J. Beutel, government liaison at the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Washington, and main author of a report by the council on radicalization and how to combat it.

Mr. Beutel, a Muslim convert from New Jersey, said the council started a grass-roots counterradicalization effort in 2005, but acknowledged that “for a while it was on the back burner.” He said, “Now we’re going to revive it.”

F.B.I. investigators were in Pakistan on Friday questioning the five Virginia men. But it remained unclear whether the men would be deported to the United States, and whether they had broken any laws in either Pakistan or the United States.

At a news conference Friday at the small Virginia mosque where the men had been youth group regulars, mosque officials expressed bewilderment at claims that the men wanted to join the jihad against American troops in Afghanistan.

“I never observed any extreme behavior from them,” said Mustafa Maryam, who runs the youth group and said he had known the young men since 2006. “They were fun-loving, career-focused children. They had a bright future before them.”

Also at the press briefing, asked about reports that the five men had contacted a Pakistani militant via the Web, Mahdi Bray, the head of the Freedom Foundation of the Muslim American Society, told reporters that YouTube and social networking sites had become a dangerous recruiting tool for militants.

“We are determined not to let religious extremists exploit the vulnerability of our children through this slick, seductive propaganda on the Internet,” said Mr. Bray, who is organizing a youth meeting later this month in Chicago to address the issue.

“Silence in cyberspace is not an option for us,” he said.

The detention of the Virginia men — ranging in age from late teens to mid-20s — would have prompted soul-searching no matter when it occurred. But it comes after a series of disturbing cases that already had terror experts speculating about a trend.

There were the November shootings that took 13 lives at Fort Hood, with murder charges pending against Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an American-born Muslim and an Army psychiatrist.

There was the arrest of Najibullah Zazi, born in Afghanistan but the seeming model of the striving immigrant as a popular coffee vendor in Manhattan, accused of going to Pakistan for explosives training with the intention of attacking in the United States.

There was David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American living in Chicago, accused of helping plan the killings in Mumbai, India, last year and of plotting attacks in Denmark.

There was Bryant Neal Vinas, a Muslim convert from Long Island who participated in a rocket attack on American troops in Afghanistan and used his knowledge of commuter trains in New York to advise Al Qaeda about potential targets.

There were the Somali-Americans from Minnesota who had traveled to Somalia to join a violent Islamist movement.

And there were cases of would-be terrorists who plotted attacks in Texas, Illinois and North Carolina with conspirators who turned out to be F.B.I. informants.

Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University, said the recent cases only confirmed that it was “myopic” to believe “we could insulate ourselves from the currents affecting young Muslims everywhere else.”

Like many other specialists, Mr. Hoffman pointed to the United States’ combat in Muslim lands as the only obvious spur to many of the recent cases, especially those with a Pakistani connection.

“The longer we’ve been in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he said, “the more some susceptible young men are coming to believe that it’s their duty to take up arms to defend their fellow Muslims.”

A few analysts, in fact, argue that Mr. Obama’s decision to send more troops to Afghanistan — intended to prevent a terrorist haven there — could backfire.

Robert A. Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, contends that suicide attacks are almost always prompted by resentment of foreign troops, and that escalation in Afghanistan will fuel more plots.

“This new deployment increases the risk of the next 9/11,” he said. “It will not make this country safer.”

Yet amid the concern about the five Virginia men and the impact of the wars on Muslim opinion, Audrey Kurth Cronin of the National War College in Washington said she found something to take comfort in.

“To me, the most interesting thing about the five guys is that it was their parents that went immediately to the F.B.I.,” she said. “It was members of the American Muslim community that put a stop to whatever those men may have been planning.”

443 2009-12-12 To the Editor:     Re ''Cap and Fade'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 7):...
444 2009-12-12 BAGHDAD — Iraq’s government sold development rights to two of its largest untapped oil fields at a public auction held under extraordinary security on Friday, three days after a series of coordinated bombings killed more than 100 people here in the capital.

A partnership of Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas, a state-owned Malaysian company, won the larger field, Majnoon, in southern Iraq, which contains an estimated 12.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil.

The second field, Halfiya, also in the south, was won by a consortium led by China National Petroleum Company that included Petronas and Total of France. It is believed to hold some 4.1 billion barrels.

The auction, the second since the 2003 invasion, attracted representatives of dozens of the world’s largest oil companies, including ExxonMobil, British Petroleum and Russia’s Lukoil. “I was nervous when I was sitting there,” said Mounir Bouaziz, a vice president at Shell, after he submitted the winning bid for the Majnoon field. “We are pleased and relieved to have won this. It has taken a lot of work to get this, including months and months of study and discussions.”

The event, shown on Iraq’s state-owned television channel, was held in the Oil Ministry under security tight by even Baghdad’s heavily policed standards. Helicopters circled overhead; thousands of police officers and soldiers patrolled roadways; streets within a mile of the ministry were closed to all vehicles but the convoys of armored S.U.V.’s ferrying oil executives; and everyone who made it inside was subjected to body searches.
445 2009-12-12 With his sharp suits and roster of famous clients, Mr. Simels joined the ranks of the city’s elite defense lawyers long ago, even as his abrasive nature set him apart. A son of the Bronx who came late to fatherhood, he had no time for bar associations and lawyers’ clubs, but plenty for his children, whom he doted on. He prepared for trials as if an empire were at stake, and even wrote one chapter, called “Cross Until They Drop,” for a book on various issues involving cross-examination. He rarely left legwork to investigators, saying he craved “eye contact” with sources.

“He had arrogance, and he pushed the envelope,” said Ronald Rubinstein, a lawyer who worked with Mr. Simels on several cases. “He was a warrior, and that’s why I like him. He served a lot of clients well.”

In a telephone interview in the wake of his sentencing, Mr. Simels spoke quietly about his accomplishments and declined to name any regrets. Citing a pending appeal, he also refused to discuss the case that led to his ruin.

He had always been very good at something.

In high school, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., it had been sports. Mr. Simels, an A student, played outfield on a team that included future major-leaguers, including Ken Singleton.

He was the president of his college fraternity and flirted with a career in medicine. After a stint in Missouri training in the Army Reserves, Mr. Simels returned to New York to start law school. The career made perfect sense. He was barely a teenager when he read his first law book, given to him by his mother’s cousin, a civil lawyer. “He had such exuberance about the law and jurisprudence,” Mr. Simels said.

In 1974, he went to work for one of the city’s legal stars, Maurice H. Nadjari, the state’s special prosecutor, newly appointed to investigate the rampant corruption in the criminal justice system at the time.

Mr. Nadjari was a controversial figure, seen as a loner and a zealous prosecutor, with little talent for self-preservation.

“He was the best boss anyone could ask for,” Mr. Simels said. “I think he was misperceived by many.”

The two shared many traits.

Richard A. Nachman, who headed the Manhattan bureau where Mr. Simels worked, said of his employee: “He was quite an aggressive young fellow — sometimes, I felt, overaggressive. If he saw a case that involved someone of some importance, he would leap at that and go to work. I don’t say that in a derogatory way.”

Mr. Pickelle, his fellow prosecutor, said he never saw a hint of unethical behavior from Mr. Simels. “Nadjari would have killed him,” he said.

Mr. Simels left the prosecutor’s office in 1979 to start his own defense practice — “It was just time to go,” he said — and within a year, he took on the case of Henry Hill, the mobster turned government informant. Mr. Simels was picked, in part, because he had no clients tied to organized crime, and representing Mr. Hill, whose life was the basis of the film “Goodfellas,” meant he never would.

Instead, he became well known for representing clients charged in drug cases, and for recurring questions about his ethics.

In 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit took up the question of whether Mr. Simels, by visiting a witness in jail who might have testified against his client — without notifying the witness’s lawyer — deserved censure.

He did not, the judges concluded, finding that Mr. Simels was “engaging in critical pretrial investigation.”

But in another case, a former client named Thomas Mickens, a convicted cocaine dealer, said that Mr. Simels had kept a government plea offer from him in order to keep getting paid. A judge found that Mr. Simels had not passed along the offer. Some of his peers said they wondered whether the steady diet of clients who were drug dealers had taken a toll on Mr. Simels.

And in a letter of support to Judge Gleeson, Joel Cohen, who was a fellow prosecutor with Mr. Simels in the 1970s, noted Mr. Simels’s isolation — he had never taken a law partner. Mr. Cohen should have been a better friend, he wrote, if only to provide a second opinion “when his faithfulness to the call of duty cried out particularly loudly from society’s reprobates.”

He was referring to clients like Shaheed Khan, a Guyanese drug trafficker whom Mr. Simels started representing with his trademark zeal in 2006. In court testimony, it emerged that Mr. Khan, the head of a paramilitary group in Guyana called the Phantom Squad, had killed several of his rivals with the help of a man named Selwyn Vaughn.

Mr. Simels met with Mr. Vaughn, believing he was still a loyal member of Mr. Khan’s organization. But he had become a government cooperator, and he was wearing a wire.

On recordings, Mr. Simels told Mr. Vaughn to put “as much pressure” as possible on a witness, as long as he did not kill the witness’s mother.

“If they think that he had something to do with the harm of a witness,” Mr. Simels said, referring to Mr. Khan, “it takes us twice as long to get in to see him, so, you know, be mindful of that.” He told Mr. Vaughn to promise another witness $10,000, and gave Mr. Vaughn a script for the witness’s testimony.

In September 2008, Mr. Simels and a young associate, Arienne Irving, were arrested on charges including witness tampering and bribery. Judge Gleeson later threw out the case against Ms. Irving. Mr. Simels hired a top defense lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, to defend him.

But the evidence that he left behind, a long trail of e-mail and instant messages seized from his computer, amounted to a strange lapse for a former prosecutor.

And for a tactician who could teach a clinic on how to cross-examine a witness, Mr. Simels stumbled badly when he took the stand, giving cagey answers.

A prosecutor, Steven L. D’Allesandro, asked him: “If a person offers a witness money, $5,000 or $10,000 or $20,000 for their testimony, that is a crime, yes or no.”

Mr. Simels answered, “I would assume it would be.”

Judge Gleeson warned Mr. Simels from the bench: “Your career is at stake,” he said. “Your liberty is at stake.”

A jury deliberated for two weeks before convicting him.

Some of Mr. Simels’s supporters said that he was misunderstood, that the words he used in the recordings reflected the street vernacular routinely employed by defense lawyers.

Judge Gleeson left little doubt what he thought. “Mr. Simels crossed a bright line,” he said. “He just lost his bearings in such a fundamental way.”
446 2009-12-12 MOSCOW — President Dmitri A. Medvedev has dismissed the head of the Moscow prisons and numerous other prison administrators in response to the death of a lawyer in pretrial detention, officials said on Friday.

The lawyer, Sergei L. Magnitsky, had been ensnared in a feud between an international investment fund, Hermitage Capital Management, and the Russian law enforcement authorities, and his defenders said his death last month showed that the country’s criminal justice system was severely troubled.

Mr. Magnitsky died of toxic shock and heart failure at a pretrial detention center in Moscow, and Mr. Medvedev reacted by ordering an inquiry into how Mr. Magnitsky was treated and into the quality of medical care in the prison system.

Aleksandr Reymer, director of the prison system, said in a radio interview on Friday that the head of the Moscow division, Vladimir Davydov, had been ousted.

Mr. Reymer said Mr. Magnitsky’s death spurred an inquiry into medical care in the prison system that found “violations of our requirements” and resulted in the dismissal of several top officials.

449 2009-12-12 Terra Firma, the British private equity firm, sued Citigroup on Friday, accusing the bank of fraud in its handling of the 2007 sale of the music publisher EMI.

In its complaint, filed in New York State Supreme Court, Terra Firma says that it was essentially tricked into paying £4 billion, or $6.5 billion, for EMI in May 2007, near the height of the private equity boom. The private equity firm and its chairman, Guy Hands, have since been criticized for paying too high a price for the music publisher only months before the credit markets began to implode.

Citigroup has also been criticized for lending billions of pounds to the deal — a loan it was unable to resell as planned when the debt markets faltered.

Terra Firma and Citigroup have since been locked in a struggle over control of EMI. Many analysts have speculated that the most likely outcome for EMI, which has lost prominent artists like Radiohead, is a fire sale to a rival like the Warner Music Group, perhaps as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.

The case seeks to cast a spotlight on some of the more questionable elements of the gilded age of private equity deals, notably the frequency of banks both advising sellers and providing financing for their takeovers. Terra Firma said in its lawsuit that Citigroup reaped about £92.5 million ($150.2 million) in the deal.

451 2009-12-12 We didn’t expect much from the first week of the conference in . Countries need to do a little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk from seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.

The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.

That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China’s absence would give other developing countries — and the — an excuse to do less than needed.

’s recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on Tuesday, in a surprising show of defensiveness, China’s top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested with the industrialized countries and jumped on the , and the for not being aggressive enough. Another Chinese official urged Washington to do “some deep soul-searching” and improve its proposal.

Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions in many industrialized countries peaking or declining, just about all of the growth in greenhouse gases is expected to come from the developing world between now and 2030, half from China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply, Mr. Stern said, but “there is no way to solve this problem by giving the major developing countries a pass.”
452 2009-12-12 Present-day practitioners of Tango Nuevo, the modernist strain of Argentine tango, face a benign but persistent quandary. Call it the Piazzolla Problem: a need to acknowledge the work of Astor Piazzolla, who spearheaded the genre, without being subsumed by his shadow.

The pianist Pablo Ziegler — a Piazzolla sideman throughout the 1980s, the composer’s last working decade — has handled this negotiation better than most over the years. But that doesn’t mean he has earned an exemption from its demands.

Mr. Ziegler is the steadfast headliner of the Tango Meets Jazz Festival, an event produced by Pat Philips and Ettore Stratta that is in its seventh year at Jazz Standard. A percussive, demonstrative pianist, he has a rigorous command of harmony and a knack for steel-girded ornamentation.

He also has a considerable cache of his own compositions in the Tango Nuevo lineage. Some of them appear on an excellent acoustic trio album, “Buenos Aires Report” (Zoho), issued in 2007.

That album’s title track was a high point of Mr. Ziegler’s first set on Thursday night, along with “La Fundición,” another bustling original. Both pieces foreground the modern-jazz affinities that Mr. Ziegler, more than Piazzolla, places near the center of his style. His band mates — Héctor del Curto on bandoneón, Claudio Ragazzi on electric guitar and Pedro Giraudo on upright bass — infused their parts with a crisp vitality.

And as with every Tango Meets Jazz Festival, there was a compatible jazz interloper: in this case, Miguel Zenón, an astute young alto saxophonist with his own notions of folkloric innovation. “Esta Plena,” released this year on Marsalis Music, deftly synthesizes folk traditions from his native Puerto Rico.

463 2009-12-13 HOUSTON — Houston became the largest city in the United States to elect an openly gay mayor on Saturday night, as voters gave a solid victory to the city controller, Annise Parker.

Cheers and dancing erupted at Ms. Parker’s campaign party as her opponent, fellow Democrat Gene Locke, a former city attorney, conceded defeat just after 10 p.m. when it became clear he could not overcome her lead.

Twenty minutes later, Ms. Parker appeared before ecstatic supporters at the city’s convention center and then joked that she was the first graduate of Rice University to be elected mayor. (She is, by the way.) Then she grew serious.

“Tonight the voters of Houston have opened the door to history,” she said, standing by her partner of 19 years, Kathy Hubbard, and their three adopted children. “I acknowledge that. I embrace that. I know what this win means to many of us who never thought we could achieve high office.”

With all precincts reporting, Ms. Parker had defeated Mr. Locke by 53 percent to 47 percent.

Throughout the campaign, Ms. Parker tried to avoid making an issue of her sexual orientation and emphasized her experience in overseeing the city’s finances. But she began her career as an advocate for gay rights in the 1980s, and it was lost on no one in Houston, a city of 2.2 million people, that her election marked a milestone for gay men and lesbians around the country.

Several smaller cities in other regions have chosen openly gay mayors, among them Providence, R.I., Portland, Ore., and Cambridge, Mass. But Ms. Parker’s success came in a conservative state where voters have outlawed gay marriage and a city where a referendum on granting benefits to same-sex partners of city employees was soundly defeated.
464 2009-12-13 Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, the power hitter Jack Cust and closer Mike MacDougal entered an already saturated free-agent market when they were not offered contracts for next year by their teams on Saturday.

The Mets did not tender contracts to pitcher Tim Redding or outfielders Jeremy Reed and Cory Sullivan.

Saturday was the deadline for offering contracts. By early evening, teams had announced they were letting more than 15 players go free, and most would have been eligible for salary arbitration if they had been offered contracts. Teams can re-sign players they let go, and the rule limiting salary cuts to 20 percent does not apply after they become free. In a slow-moving market, just 32 of the 171 players who filed for free agency after the World Series are known to have agreements for next season.

Wang, a 29-year-old right-hander, was a 19-game winner in 2006 and 2007, but he has not been the same since severely injuring his right foot while running the bases at Houston on June 15, 2008.

His 2009 season was ended by shoulder pain. Dr. James Andrews repaired a tear in Wang’s right shoulder capsule during arthroscopic surgery July 29. Wang is not expected to be able to pitch until possibly June.
465 2009-12-13 Moving to fill a void in the upper echelon of his department, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has tapped Patrick Timlin, a decorated former commander, to return as a civilian deputy commissioner.

Mr. Timlin, 52, who supervised detectives in Queens and later served as the senior commander in the Bronx until he retired in July 2002, will take over in January as deputy commissioner of operations.

He is now an executive at Michael Stapleton Associates, a security firm in Manhattan.

“Commissioner Kelly hoped to persuade him to return to public service, and he did,” Paul J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman, said on Saturday. “He thinks he’s highly regarded throughout law enforcement.”

Mr. Browne said Mr. Kelly was met with a round of applause from his executive staff when he informed them last week of Mr. Timlin’s appointment.

Mr. Kelly said he was impressed by Mr. Timlin’s talent and the fact that he had reached high rank “at a very young age.” Mr. Timlin was in his early 40s when he was named the Bronx commander.
466 2009-12-13 PARKLAND, Wash. (AP) — Hundreds of police officers and other customers lined up here early Saturday for the reopening of the coffee shop where four officers were shot and killed two weeks ago.

The Forza Coffee shop opened its doors at 8:14 a.m., the time at which a gunman ambushed Sgt. Mark Renninger and Officers Ronald Owens, Tina Griswold and Greg Richards on Nov. 29. All four worked for the Lakewood Police Department

The gunman, Maurice Clemmons, was later shot and killed by the Seattle police.

Chief Bret Farrar of Lakewood was the first customer on Saturday and said it was heartwarming to see such support from the community.

The coffee shop now features a large framed poster with portraits of the officers. Eventually it plans to hang plaques honoring them.
467 2009-12-13 “We are watching the budget like everyone else,” General Bunting said.

Operations will be consolidated at the remaining 38 armories. Equipment and personnel will be transferred to those locations through the middle of 2010.

General Bunting said he and his staff members notified each community where armories are closing to break the news.

“We clearly understand that this is your community and your armory and you are clearly disappointed,” General Bunting said.

State Senator Jay Emler, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said armories were important not only because of their role in Guard training but because they house equipment used in natural disasters. And, he noted, they have often sheltered people in storms.

But, he said, budget problems have forced Kansas to set priorities.

“The public has been served well by those armories, but in the long run, the public is probably going to be served better by education than armories,” said Mr. Emler, a Republican.

Friday’s announcement follows similar action taken in Virginia and Washington earlier this year.

Three armories were closed this year by the Washington Military Department, leaving 23 statewide. The closings will save $176,000. Six other facilities are scheduled to close in 2010, Capt. Steve Hobbs said.

“The communities are hurt a little bit to see the armory gone,” Captain Hobbs said. “There are a few communities that see it as an opportunity.”

Virginia closed armories in Richmond and Roanoke this month. Maj. Cotton Puryear said the cuts were part of Gov. Tim Kaine’s budget-balancing package and would save Virginia $115,000.

General Bunting said the Kansas closings would not affect the Guard’s ability to respond to natural disasters, pointing out that there was not an armory in Greensburg in 2007 when that town was leveled by a tornado.

“We don’t like to close armories,” General Bunting said. “We like to be in as many counties as we can.”
468 2009-12-13 Though oil companies have shied away from Iraq because of violence, corruption and the lack of a national oil law guaranteeing that deals would survive changes in government, many of the world’s largest oil firms competed aggressively in the two-day public auction. Two deals were reached Friday, and the rest on Saturday.

The corporations that won represented a diverse group of nations, including Angola, Malaysia, Turkey and China. They were vying for 20-year service contracts that will pay them a fee for each barrel they produce above a government-set baseline.

Despite what are expected to be slim profit margins for the companies, the auction’s biggest winners appeared to be Petronas, a state-owned Malaysian company that was part of three separate consortiums that won the rights to three fields; Sonangol, an Angolan company that will develop two fields; and Lukoil, the Russian oil company, which won the rights to part of the West Qurna field in southern Iraq, the most sought prize of the auction.

In the years since the invasion, Lukoil officials lobbied first the Americans and then the Iraqi government for permission to develop West Qurna, given that the company had signed a contract for the field in 1997 with Saddam Hussein, who later annulled the deal.

Mr. Shahristani said the deals reached at the auction, combined with other recent oil field development deals, put the country on track to increase its oil output from its current level of 2.5 million barrels a day to 12 million barrels a day by 2016, which would surpass Saudi Arabia’s current production.

But that does not account for major hitches in development that could be brought on by technical troubles with the fields, violence and political instability.

The auction, the second since the 2003 United States-led invasion, is likely to be the last for some time, with national elections scheduled for March and political wrangling expected to follow them.

Also on Saturday, Jawad al-Bolani, the minister of the interior, told Parliament during a closed session that his ministry — which includes the Iraqi national police — had received information about terrorism operations planned for last Tuesday, when more than 120 people were killed during a series of coordinated bombings in Baghdad, according to two members of Parliament who attended the session.

Mr. Bolani could not be reached Saturday evening for comment.

The lawmakers, Adel Beck Barwari and Hassan Uthman, said Mr. Bolani told the members that as his officers tried to intercept three vehicles believed to be driven by suicide bombers, the drivers detonated their explosives.

Mr. Barwari said Mr. Bolani reported that the drivers apparently did not reach their intended targets but killed the officers in the explosion.
469 2009-12-13 Yitzhak Ganon avoided doctors for 65 years. But when he became sick recently, his wife insisted that he visit one. Stents were implanted to help his heart in a procedure made more risky because he was missing a kidney. What happened to his other kidney explained his aversion to doctors, according to an account he gave Spiegel Online. While held at the Auschwitz concentration camp, the 85-year-old Mr. Gannon told his doctors, he was the subject of an experiment by Joseph Mengele, the Nazi physician known as “the Angel of Death.” Mr. Ganon was tied down on a table, and, without anesthesia, cut open by Mengele, who then removed his kidney. “I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,” Mr. Ganon said.
470 2009-12-13 Dr. Emily Ann Apsell and David Ian Singer were married Saturday evening at the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston. Rabbi David J. Meyer officiated.

Dr. Singer, 29, is a fourth-year resident in anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. She graduated magna cum laude from Cornell and received a medical degree from Tufts.

She is a daughter of Paula S. Apsell and Sheldon Apsell of Newton, Mass. Her father is an inventor who helped develop the LoJack stolen-vehicle recovery system and other electronic devices. He was a founder and the chief executive officer of Micrologic, an electronic product development company in Westborough, Mass., and is the board chairman of the Academy of Applied Science, a nonprofit organization in Concord, N.H., that mentors high school students. The bride’s mother is the senior executive producer of the PBS science series “Nova.”

Mr. Singer, 30, is a sales operations manager for EMC Corporation, a data storage company, in Hopkinton, Mass. He also graduated from Tufts, and received an M.B.A. from New York University.

He is a son of Michelle and Gregory Singer of Jericho, N.Y. The bridegroom’s father is the president of Martack Corporation, a heating and air-conditioning contractor in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The bridegroom’s mother works there as an accountant.
471 2009-12-13 The tentative deal reached in October was intended to bridge the gap between Iran’s assertion that it wants only civilian nuclear energy and Western suspicions about a weapons program, buying time for a broader diplomatic solution.

Under that deal, Iran would send out the bulk of its uranium in one shipment to allay Western fears that it was enriching the remainder for military purposes. The agreement envisioned the transfer taking place before the end of this year.

The uranium shipped out would be returned in a form usable for Iran’s research reactor but very difficult to convert to weapons production.

Iran has sent mixed signals on the nuclear deal in recent weeks, with some comments suggesting that it has decisively rejected it in any form, and others hinting that the matter was unresolved. Iran’s deliberations appear to have been affected by internal divisions since the contested June presidential election and its violent aftermath.

Under the new proposal, the uranium exchange would take place on the Iranian island of Kish in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Mottaki said at a regional security conference in Bahrain.

The details of the proposal were vague, and it was unclear whether he was reverting to an earlier counterproposal already rejected by world powers: that international arms inspectors take custody of much of Iran’s fuel, but keep it on Kish.

“I think the reason for this gesture is that there is now some unanimity on pursuing sanctions,” said Valerie Lincy, a senior researcher with the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington-based nonprofit group.

The Iranians appear to be hoping their proposal will divide the powers that are considering sanctions, she added.

Russia and China have traditionally been reluctant to impose new sanctions, but United States leaders have hoped that Iran’s recent intransigence would convince them to change their stance.

Mr. Mottaki also suggested that the Western news media had helped torpedo the October agreement by framing it in hostile terms that confirmed Iran’s fears of losing its nuclear supplies.

“We said we are in agreement on the principles of the proposal, but suddenly the Western media announced that 1,200 kilograms of uranium would be leaving Iran to delay the construction of a nuclear bomb,” Mr. Mottaki said, according to Iran’s semiofficial Mehr news agency. “Is this the answer to Iran’s confidence-building?”

Also on Saturday, thousands of clerics rallied in cities across Iran for a second day to express their anger at protesters who had burned pictures of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during antigovernment demonstrations last week, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. Ayatollah Khamenei holds a semidivine authority in Iran, and burning his image violated a taboo.

Protesters have taken to the streets intermittently since the election in June.
472 2009-12-13 When McNabb was out of earshot, Vick said: “He’s always giving me good advice. The ultimate goal is to help Donovan get his Super Bowl ring. And I think he’s on his way.”

Such a championship would be a threshold for McNabb and the Eagles, football’s best underhyped team of the decade. In regular-season games since 2000, the Eagles are 100-55-1.

That puts them behind only Indianapolis (113-43) and New England (109-47). But the Colts and the Patriots have won Super Bowls; Philadelphia reached it in 2005, but lost.

“It means a lot to have the third-best record,” linebacker Akeem Jordan said. “I know this city supports us. But they just hate to see us fall in the playoffs.”

People in high places will agree he has that right. “It is a very high-expectation and high-demand fan base,” Mayor Michael Nutter said in a telephone interview.

Nutter said he attended Eagles games with his father at Franklin Field, starting shortly after their last N.F.L. title in 1960, before the Super Bowl era.

“Eagles fans are possibly, decibel for decibel, a little louder and certainly a little more aggressive,” Nutter said. “But Philadelphia fans fully love them. They resonate.”

The Eagles (8-4) will continue their quest Sunday night when they visit the Giants (7-5) in a game that will damage the playoff aspirations of the loser.

They will bring to the Meadowlands several of pro football’s primary undercurrents, including off-field law breaking in the case of Vick. Another theme, concussions, is personified in Brian Westbrook, their veteran running back.

He practiced last week but will sit out Sunday to recover from his second concussion of the season.

“It’s not like an ankle,” Westbrook said. “I’m more concerned about how things will happen for me in the future. Head injuries can affect my life down the road.”

Coach Andy Reid, in his 11th season, is second in current N.F.L. coaching tenure behind Jeff Fisher of Tennessee, now in his 15th full season. Last week Reid signed a three-year extension through 2013.

With Giants Stadium about to close, Reid and his team bring to their final regular-season visit a history of late-season surges and a three-game winning streak over their hosts, including a playoff victory at the Meadowlands last January. In that one, McNabb angered some Giants and many fans when he finished a play by running out of bounds and picking up a telephone on the Giants’ bench.

If it seemed as if he was gloating, it was just another detail in the rivalry between bedrock franchises of old American cities that are neighbors separated by the New Jersey Turnpike.

New York and Philadelphia are among 13 metropolitan areas with teams in all four major professional leagues. The overlap can be seen in McNabb’s locker, which displays the big stick of Flyers goalie Ray Emery.

Discussing what he would remember about Giants Stadium, Reid wondered about a customer who teases him about his girth as he walks onto the field.

“Hopefully, they’ll move the seat, at the tunnel, of the guy who tells me how many salad bars I need to visit,” Reid said.

Such are the manners of the fans of the Northeast. Philadelphia fans also voice opinions. Winston Justice, the Eagles’ right tackle, said, “In Philly, the fans are going to tear you down if you do bad and they’re going tear you down if you do good.”

His observation recalled one by Mike Schmidt, the Phillies’ Hall of Fame third baseman, who once called Philadelphia “the only city where you can experience the thrill of victory and the agony of reading about it the next day.”

The fans have their reasons for frustration, said Glen Macnow, who co-hosts a radio talk show on WIP.

“Most of my listeners were not alive for an Eagles parade down Broad Street,” Macnow said. In the meantime, the city’s other three teams have won at least one title each.

One of those deprived fans is Liz High, 28, a lawyer who grew up cheering for all local teams but with a special affinity for the Eagles, something she said she inherited from her mother.

High has attended games at Lincoln Financial Field and said her Eagles remained the top team in town even when the Phillies won the World Series in 2008.

“The World Series win last year breathed a sign of relief,” High said. “But if the Eagles won the Super Bowl, this town would probably erupt.”

High said she had attended games of Philadelphia’s other teams and heard fans spontaneously break out in the Eagles’ fight song. The lyrics were on the tip of her tongue. With little prodding, High recited:

On the road to victory.

On the road to victory!
473 2009-12-13 William Styron may have been one of the leading literary lions of recent decades, but his books are not selling much these days. Now his family has a plan to lure digital-age readers with e-book versions of titles like “Sophie’s Choice,” “The Confessions of Nat Turner” and Mr. Styron’s memoir of depression, “Darkness Visible.”

But the question of exactly who owns the electronic rights to such older titles is in dispute, making it a rising source of conflict in one of the publishing industry’s last remaining areas of growth.

Mr. Styron’s family believes it retains the rights, since the books were first published before e-books existed. Random House, Mr. Styron’s longtime publisher, says it owns those rights, and it is determined to secure its place  and continuing profits  in the Kindle era.

The discussions about the digital fate of Mr. Styron’s work are similar to the negotiations playing out across the book industry as publishers hustle to capture the rights to release e-book versions of so-called backlist books. Indeed, the same new e-book venture Mr. Styron’s family hopes to use has run into similar resistance from the print publisher of “Catch-22” by Joseph Heller.

On Friday, Markus Dohle, chief executive of Random House, sent a letter to dozens of literary agents, writing that the company’s older agreements gave it “the exclusive right to publish in electronic book publishing formats.”

Backlist titles, which continue to be reprinted long after their initial release, are crucial to publishing houses because of their promise of lucrative revenue year after year. But authors and agents are particularly concerned that traditional publishers are not offering sufficient royalties on e-book editions, which they point out are cheaper for publishers to produce. Some are considering taking their digital rights elsewhere, which could deal a financial blow to the hobbled publishing industry.

The tussle over who owns the electronic rights  and how much the authors should earn in digital royalties  potentially puts into play works by authors like Ralph Ellison and John Updike.

Some publishers have already made agreements with authors or their estates to release digital editions. All of Ernest Hemingway’s books, for example, are available in electronic versions from his print publisher, Scribner, a unit of Simon & Schuster.

But with only a small fraction of the thousands of books in print available in e-book form, there are many titles to be fought over.

“This is a wide open frontier right now,” said Maja Thomas, senior vice president for digital and audio publishing at the Hachette Book Group.

While most traditional publishers have included e-book rights in new author contracts for 15 years, many titles were originally published before e-books were explicitly included in contracts.

And with electronic readers like the Kindle from Amazon and the Nook from Barnes & Noble attracting new readers and sales of e-books growing exponentially, authors and publishers are trying to figure out how best to harness the new technology.

New ventures focusing explicitly on e-books are cropping up regularly, and some offer authors better financial terms than the traditional publishers.

In the case of Mr. Styron, who died in 2006 at age 81, the eight titles his family wants to re-release as e-books were published in print before 1994. This fall, Mr. Styron’s estate reached an agreement with a new company, Open Road Integrated Media, founded by Jane Friedman, the former chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide, and Jeffrey Sharp, a film producer.

In October, Open Road announced that it would produce e-books of Mr. Styron’s work, along with several older titles by Pat Conroy and Iris Murdoch.

Alexandra Styron, 43, Mr. Styron’s youngest daughter, said her family liked that a company “focused on the idea of the future of the book industry wanted to make my father’s books an important part of their plan to bring old and long-gone authors into the 21st century.”

Ms. Styron said her family was happy with the job Random House, and their father’s editor, Robert Loomis, had done for Mr. Styron’s work. But with e-books, she said, “we didn’t feel that we were getting any similar kind of full-court press.”

In his letter on Friday, Mr. Dohle said that authors were precluded “from granting publishing rights to third parties.” Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said the company expected to “continue to publish the Styron books we own in all formats, including e-books.”

Mr. Sharp, president of Open Road, said in an e-mailed statement: “We are confident in our agreements and only make deals with parties who represent to us that they own the rights.”

Several publishers who say they retain e-book rights on old contracts are working to amend those agreements to insert digital royalty rates. A spokesman for Simon & Schuster, Adam Rothberg, said the company has amended many old contracts. “Our plan is to publish all our backlist in e-book form,” he said.

Open Road announced in October that it planned to publish an e-book version of “Catch-22,” which is published in print by Simon & Schuster. It is a mainstay of college reading lists and this year has sold 85,000 copies in its paperback edition, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of total sales.

Mr. Rothberg would not comment directly on “Catch-22.” But Amanda Urban, a literary agent who represents Mr. Heller’s estate, said in an e-mail message that her agency, International Creative Management, believes the e-book rights reside with the author, not the print publisher.

Ms. Urban said that there was not yet a signed deal with Open Road but that discussions were continuing.

There is some precedent for arguments over e-book versions of backlist titles. In 2001, Random House sued RosettaBooks, an e-book publisher, for copyright infringement when Rosetta signed contracts with authors  including Mr. Styron  to release digital versions of previously published novels.

In its suit, Random House relied on wording in its contracts that granted it all rights to publish the works “in book form.” In its letter to agents on Friday, Random House invoked the same wording to defend its right to publish e-books of backlist titles.

In 2001, a federal judge in Manhattan denied Random House’s request for a preliminary injunction against RosettaBooks, ruling that “in book form” did not automatically include e-books. An appellate court similarly denied Random House’s request.

The case never went to trial. In a settlement, Random House granted Rosetta a license to release e-book versions of 51 titles. Under a different agreement with Mr. Styron, Rosetta also published two of his books, though its license to do so has since expired.

Agents say some authors and their estates are seeking alternative routes for e-books in part because they are dissatisfied with the digital royalty rate offered by most traditional publishers. That rate  typically 25 percent of net proceeds  generally results in authors receiving less than they typically receive on hardcover editions. Agents argue that because it costs publishers less to produce and distribute e-books, authors should receive more, not less, in digital royalties.

“I think the potential danger that publishers run by not talking this through carefully,” said Andrew Wylie, a literary agent who represents the estates of authors of backlist titles not yet in digital form, including Ralph Ellison and Vladimir Nabokov, “is that they will be excluded from e-book rights in a significant way.”
474 2009-12-13 COPENHAGEN  Waving a panoply of signs warning that the planet is in peril and that powerful nations should take note, tens of thousands of demonstrators from around the globe took to the streets here on Saturday for the largest protest planned in two weeks of talks on a global strategy to combat climate change.

The police and organizers estimated that 60,000 to 100,000 participants joined a long march from Christiansborg Slotsplads, or Castle Square, southward to the Bella Center, the sprawling and heavily fortified convention center where delegates and observers from nearly 200 nations are gathered to seek a consensus.

The main demonstration  which brought together a broad coalition of hundreds of environmental groups, human rights campaigners, climate activists, anticapitalists and freelance protesters from dozens of countries  was mostly peaceful. But in other parts of the city, spontaneous demonstrations by bands of radical protesters resulted in at least 950 arrests, the police said.

A spokeswoman for the police department said there were scattered reports of localized riots in which protesters threw rocks and smashed windows. The police said that four parked cars had been set ablaze in the Christiana neighborhood and that at least one police officer had been struck in the jaw by a rock.

“We saved the demonstration from being disturbed totally,” said Per Larsen, chief coordinator for the Danish police. “There were some hard-core protesters that we have neutralized.”

The violence was a counterpoint to the otherwise peaceful march, in which a rolling sea of flags and banners undulated across the city. Most bore slogans related to global warming or urging world leaders to resolve the vast differences that still make an international accord seem elusive as talks here move into the second and final week.

On a stage at the eastern edge of the square, a succession of speakers stoked a cheering crowd, their voices booming over loudspeakers. “My words cannot replace action,” said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the leader of Denmark’s Social Democrats, the dominant opposition party here. “We are here to show leaders that what is made by man, can be changed by man.”

In the throng was 26-year-old Jemimah Maitei, dressed in traditional clothing from her native Kenya. She said she had traveled to Copenhagen to be part of a delegation representing indigenous peoples at the talks, which are overseen by the United Nations.

“I came here to give my views on how climate change is impacting my community,” Ms. Maitei said. She cited relentless droughts that had made growing crops, among other things, increasingly difficult for the Masai, her ethnic group.

The vast demonstration, which unfolded in crisp temperatures under cloudless skies, was not the exclusive province of climate campaigners. Groups of diverse social and political pedigree took advantage of the huge gathering to advance their agendas, too. One sign urged the overthrow of the Iranian government. Another, with the words “Earth in Need: Delete Meat,” was one of many promoting vegetarian diets.

People calling for a free Tibet were well represented, and a small contingent of climate skeptics and libertarians derided the United Nations talks.

“We want to be able to live our lives like we’ve always led them before  as free citizens in free democracies,” said David Pontoppidan, a graduate student in sociology at the University of Copenhagen, who addressed passers-by through a megaphone over the chatter of two helicopters hovering far above. “We want free debate; we want to be able to be taken seriously even though we don’t agree with the U.N.”

By midafternoon, as the throng made its way over the canal and southward toward the Bella Center, small bands of black-clad youths chanting anticapitalist slogans and carrying sticks and rocks could be seen infiltrating the otherwise peaceful crowd.

At around 3:30, dozens of Danish police officers penetrated the parade near its tail and surrounded a group of the more radical protesters. At the end of the march, a stage was set up for more speeches. One speaker railed against nuclear power, and another against genetically modified food. A speaker from India demanded that rich nations provide technology to develop flood- and drought-resistant crops.

Given that the lion’s share of greenhouse gases have been emitted by industrialized nations, developing countries have argued that they have a duty to help poor lands deal with the consequences of global warming, including drought, floods and tropical storms.

While several demonstrators made for the Metro trains, others decided to avoid the crush of the crowds and walk back to the city the way they came. Among them were Lars Leffland and Lise Blaase, a couple from Copenhagen.

“The demonstration when it started was very beautiful with all the colors and the music,” Mr. Leffland said. But Ms. Blaase suggested that what had begun with exuberance seemed, in the end, to simply fizzle.

“It was somewhat of an anticlimax,” she said as she walked north away from the Bella Center. “It seemed as if no one was in charge, and there was no closure.”
475 2009-12-13 Sometimes, an ailing child is the trigger.

That was the case for a family at the emergency shelter in Bridgeport. Both parents had been working, but when one of their three children became seriously ill, the mother left her job and the family lost their apartment, said Lorrie Brooks, who coordinates homeless services at the Alpha Community Services Y.M.C.A.

The caseload at Alpha, the only emergency shelter for families in Bridgeport, has doubled, to an anticipated 350 families by the end of this year, from 170 last year, Ms. Brooks said.

Officials moved the family that had lost its apartment into transitional housing, where they can stay for up to 18 months while they save at least 10 percent of their income, and the mother has been able to go back to work. The hope is that they can become financially stable enough to get a new apartment.

The Y.M.C.A. center is also struggling with a changing clientele. It is seeing an influx of two-parent families, many of them middle class, who have no idea how to negotiate the system and may need just a month of shelter until their unemployment benefits come through, said Carmen Colon, the executive director. For renters, she said, there are cash grants available through HUD’s Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program. But that money, part of the Obama administration’s stimulus package, is not available for homeowners facing foreclosure.

“The funds will be available for them once they have lost their homes and become homeless,” Ms. Colon said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”
476 2009-12-13 ANY production of a new play is entitled to call itself a “world premiere,” whether or not the world cares. But a world premiere from Athol Fugard, recognized on three continents as a major playwright, actually merits the description.

With the current run of “Have You Seen Us?” at the Long Wharf Theater (reviewed by Charles Isherwood of The New York Times on Tuesday), New Haven has its second Fugard world premiere in two seasons. The coup is the outgrowth of the partnership Mr. Fugard, 77, has forged with Gordon Edelstein, the artistic director at Long Wharf — a relationship that both men say goes well beyond the usual marriage of convenience between those who write plays for a living and those who put them on.

Mr. Fugard: “In Gordon I’ve found somebody who can relieve me of the burden of directing my own work.”

Mr. Edelstein: “I have extraordinary respect for the beauty and truth of Athol Fugard’s stories.”

The love fest began for Mr. Edelstein, 55, when his parents took him to see “The Island,” Mr. Fugard’s drama about two black political prisoners in South Africa, on Broadway. Mr. Edelstein was awed, he said, by “the power of the performance” — John Kani and Winston Ntshona, who collaborated with Mr. Fugard on the script, shared a 1975 Tony Award for their acting — “and by the uncompromising nature of its vision.”
477 2009-12-13 Women Who Want to Want

Daniel Bergner’s article poignantly expresses both the deep distress felt by women at the loss of their libido as well as the complexity of treating the condition. Women’s sexual problems must be assessed by integrating the emotional, physical and psychosocial perspectives in order for us to be successful in treating them. Most often, as Bergner’s article states, recommended treatment protocols are unilateral; the false assumption is that one “magic bullet” should alleviate the problem. Only with an integrated approach to diagnosing and treating women with sexual dysfunction will more have a better chance at achieving what they are looking for — a full and satisfying sex life.

As a sexual-treatment therapist for more than 30 years (and an author of “Still Sexy After All These Years? The Nine Unspoken Truths About Women’s Desire Beyond 50”), I found the direction of Brotto’s work on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definitions of women’s sexual desire very disheartening. What troubles me is that the accepted approach to diagnosis in this arena is to start from the point of view of women who define themselves as dysfunctional. But we must recognize that women have little to go on other than popular media’s exaggerated view of female sexuality when making that judgment of themselves. Without first doing the long-term research needed to understand the full range of women’s experiences of sexual desire, we simply do not have an accurate baseline from which to judge dysfunction.

I had been working in the field of human sexuality for decades when I reached menopause myself. At that point, I did not know, beyond myth and hearsay, what normal changes occur in women’s sexuality as they age past menopause. In an attempt to address this lack of information, my co-author and I interviewed more than 500 women from ages 50 to 95 across the United States from 2003-5. The most profound insight we gained was how little women know about how other women function sexually. Repeatedly we were asked, “What is normal?” Sexuality is such a complex, dynamic aspect of a woman’s experience that the range of “normal” may be far broader than any of us realizes.

In James Traub’s article (Nov. 29), he writes, “Empire-building is not encouraged in the Obama administration.” What, then, are readers to make of the administration’s “bright idea” of having Vice President Biden administer the oath of American citizenship on July 4 to immigrant soldiers under a giant American flag hanging from the ceiling of Al Faw Palace in formerly sovereign Iraq? It is fitting that war and occupation have turned Iraq into a cradle of American nationhood, as American empire- and nation-building have been intimately linked since the founding of the republic. But it remains to be seen whether nation-building — the necessary legitimizing corollary to empire-building in our post-Wilsonian world — will result in effective sovereignty for Iraq (and Afghanistan) and security for the United States.
478 2009-12-13 Ski resorts were caught flat-footed by the recession last year, as many skiers and snowboaders stayed home. And if they dusted off their skis, many opted for the modest mountain in their backyard, instead of jetting off to the glittering peaks out West.

The forecast this year is sunnier. Not only is the economy looking up, but ski resorts have had all year to prepare, with special deals, cheaper flights and other enticements to lure skiers back.

529 2009-12-14 A New York State appellate court has misguidedly put a roadblock in the way of Columbia University’s expansion plans, ruling that the state misused eminent domain to help Columbia assemble the land it needs. This decision conflicts with the relevant law and will make it much harder for the university to move ahead with a project that would benefit the surrounding neighborhood and the entire city.

Columbia is outgrowing its Morningside Heights campus and is planning a major expansion north into West Harlem that would include school buildings, laboratories and publicly accessible open space. It would allow the school to better pursue its important missions of education and research. It would also provide the community with jobs and amenities, including widened, pedestrian-friendly streets and space for local artists.

To secure enough land, the university is relying in part on the Empire State Development Corporation’s eminent domain power, compelling holdout commercial property owners to sell. Several of the holdouts sued, arguing that the use of eminent domain was illegal.

In a weakly reasoned decision, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court agreed, by a 3-to-2 vote. The majority took the peculiar position that there is no civic purpose behind Columbia’s decision to expand.

The decision is completely out of step with eminent domain law, including a recent 6-to-1 decision from the New York State Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. That court ruled that Brooklyn’s Atlantic Yards, a commercial development, can use eminent domain to secure land to build new housing and a basketball arena for the Nets. That was the right decision, and the case for Columbia is even stronger.

The civic purpose in the Columbia expansion is clear, given the contributions it would make to education, the job market and community life. The Empire State Development Corporation also made a thoroughly defensible decision that eminent domain was appropriate given the blighted condition of the land at issue, between 125th and 133rd Streets near the Hudson River.
530 2009-12-14 There’s much to be said for a market-driven process. But each new piece of information is making Goldman’s buyback look pricier. Sure, the firm’s share price at the time was some 30 percent above the warrants’ strike price. And arguing with the Treasury probably seemed risky given the uproar over bonuses.

Even so, if the Treasury isn’t getting the prices it had hoped for at auction there’s at least one consolation. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and his overworked staff may have achieved a rare feat: persuading the masters of the universe at Goldman to pay more than the going rate.

Smartphones are proliferating and telecommunications companies are starting to choke.

Mobile data traffic on AT&T’s network has risen more than fiftyfold over the last three years. The majority of the increase has come from iPhone users, and rivals are starting to push competing gadgets. The rub is that data revenue isn’t growing anywhere near fast enough to generate an attractive return on the needed capital expenditure. Something has to give.

AT&T is the only official provider of service for the Apple iPhone in the United States. Its revenue from mobile data is growing at an annual rate of above 30 percent. As the company states, this means operating margins are rising sharply.

Unfortunately, this isn’t a very useful metric. It leaves out the cost of the capital investment AT&T needs to make to serve up all that data. Add this back, and iPhone subscribers might be worth nothing at all to AT&T, the research and investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company argues.

The company disagrees, pointing out that it has gained large numbers of customers because of the iPhone, while keeping capital expenditure at a lower level than last year. However, in a speech last week, the head of AT&T’s mobile division, Ralph de la Vega, seemed to recognize there was a problem.

He said AT&T was trying to find a way to get the 3 percent of customers consuming 40 percent of the data to either reduce or modify their usage so that they don’t crowd out others. Many clients in New York City, for example, complain of dropped calls.

How exactly AT&T will achieve this is unclear. Current iPhone customers pay for unlimited data plans. Nor is this just an American problem; European operators including O2 in Britain have similar issues.

And in any event, the bandwidth hogs may simply be a harbinger of how mobile devices will function in the future. If so, a few incentives or penalties for the heaviest users won’t relieve congestion for long. Eventually most consumers will probably face bigger bills to help companies pay for capital investment. If mobile networks become simply a capital expenditure game, larger operators may have the advantage. Smaller competitors like Sprint could struggle to keep up, or find themselves forced into the arms of rivals.
531 2009-12-14 Lawrence H. Summers, the White House chief economic adviser, said on “This Week” on ABC that bankers “need to recognize that they’ve got obligations to the country after all that’s been done for them, and there is a lot more they can do.”

Indeed, if the government approves Citigroup’s repayment of taxpayer funds, it would free it from pay restrictions for banks that received multiple bailouts. And with most of the nation’s biggest banks out of the bailout program, the president may soon lose some of his leverage over the banks.

The White House has pointed to banks’ repayment as proof that the bailouts helped the financial system recover from near disaster, but it wants the banks to help get the economy moving by lending more to companies to create jobs and to consumers in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure.

Including Citigroup, bailed-out banks will have returned at least $136 billion, or more than half the $245 billion in bailout money extended this year — far faster than anticipated. Of course, the government still has tens of billions of dollars at stake with companies like the American International Group and General Motors.

The negotiations between Citigroup and regulators come just over a week after the government allowed its troubled rival Bank of America to repay its bailout money and underscore just how quickly confidence has returned to the financial markets.

That improvement holds the key to Citigroup’s payback plan, as private investors replace $45 billion of taxpayer funds and as the bank weans itself off additional forms of government assistance.

Citigroup officials plan to announce a broad program as early as Monday. In a series of complex transactions, bank officials expect to raise about $18 billion by selling stock this week, in an effort to assuage regulators’ concerns about the bank’s ability to weather another severe economic downturn without returning to the government for more money.

With its regulators’ permission, Citigroup would then redeem at least $20 billion of preferred stock that the government received as part of the bank’s first two rescues late last year. It would also exit a federal insurance policy on about $250 billion of troubled real estate and credit card assets. The bank, not taxpayers, would then be liable for those losses.

The Treasury also wants to wind down its 34 percent ownership stake in Citigroup, which it acquired by converting $25 billion of preferred shares into common stock in a third rescue this year. The government is expected to sell its nearly 7.7 billion shares through a series of large stock sales over the next several months to institutional investors.

But Citigroup’s troubles, and those of other banks, are far from over. Some analysts believe the banks are too weak to repay the taxpayer money. If the government allows banks to deplete their capital levels too soon, they argue, they may be setting the stage for another crisis.

For Citigroup, a repayment could help it shed the stigma of having accepted bailout cash. But in some ways, it may be a hollow victory for Citigroup’s chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.

The move itself is unlikely to hasten the bank’s rapid return to financial health. In fact, it has already proved costly to its existing shareholders in the short term. Citigroup’s shares fell nearly 3 percent last week, to $3.95, over concerns the new stock offering would dilute their value.

Even if a repayment deal is completed, it will still take several more years to clean up the financial carnage. Citigroup has not posted a substantial profit in seven quarters, and the bank is expected to muddle through most of 2010 amid another wave of mortgage and credit card losses.

And, like several big rivals, the bank continues to lean heavily on government support through a debt guarantee program that makes taxpayers liable if it is unable to pay back the loans. Some analysts think that the bank is still too weak to stand on its own.

Citigroup executives, however, maintain that paying back the bailout money would have big advantages. Bank officials say it would quell fear that many of its most talented bankers and traders might join hedge funds and other rivals that have no restriction on hiring or bonuses.

Although Citigroup would still fall under the pay rules outlined in the economic stimulus bill until the government sells its entire ownership stake, its exit from the bailout program would mean it would no longer be subject to the harsher rules imposed by the federal pay czar.

Regulators remain concerned about the bank’s financial condition. After Bank of America received permission to exit the bailout program early this month, Citigroup officials redoubled their efforts to sever ties with Washington. Much of the discussion centered on how much additional capital Citigroup would need to replenish its coffers after the government’s exit.

Citigroup argued it should have to raise only $15 billion more, an amount that would reduce the bank’s current capital levels and still leave it with a bigger cushion than its competitors. But federal regulators were split over whether that was sufficient.

Treasury and some Federal Reserve officials felt more comfortable with that amount. But officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has testy relations with Citigroup and deeper financial exposure, demanded it hold more capital.

Tensions have been running high as Citigroup and its regulators crammed a process that had taken months into a little more than a week of marathon discussions. If Citigroup does not reach a deal by Tuesday, bank officials fear it would be hard to pull off a big stock offering until next year, because many big investors leave for the holiday vacation.

The regulators’ decision is likely to cause dozens of small and regional banks to repay the government soon and rid themselves of public controversy. At the same time, it could take extra capital out of the banking system that might otherwise encourage lending. Many of those banks are in the eye of the financial storm as losses on commercial real estate and corporate loans worsen.

Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, two large consumer banks that acquired deeply troubled rivals in the throes of the crisis, are still holding on to billions of dollars of taxpayer funds. Many community banks received millions.
532 2009-12-14 As Tiger Woods’s major sponsors plot their own courses in the enlarging wake of multiple accusations of Woods’s marital infidelities, the PGA Tour and its players must also deal with the prospect of yet another protracted absence by its biggest rainmaker.

“We need him out here because of sponsorships and just the awareness in our tour in general,” Steve Stricker told PGATour.com.

Stricker, the No. 3-ranked golfer in the world, was describing what came to be known as the Tiger Effect from the first day Woods joined the tour in 1996  no Woods, no ratings.

Sponsors have reacted quickly after Woods announced Friday that he would take an “indefinite break” from the PGA Tour to work on his marriage. The global consulting giant Accenture ended its endorsement contract with Woods on Sunday, a day after Gillette announced it would reduce his presence in its advertising.

His presence on the tour is in question at least for the start of the 2010 season, which creates different concerns for the PGA Tour and golf in general. Most of his fellow competitors are prefacing or punctuating their remarks with expressions of concern for Woods’s well-being, but all are aware of the effect he has on everything from the number of people who attend tournaments to the number of zeroes on the checks they deposit if they manage to beat him.

Although Woods is not solely responsible for the economic growth of the tour, he is given much of the credit for the quadrupling of prize money since he joined it  from $70 million in 1996 to $278 million in 2009. Most of the larger purses directly result from higher revenue from title sponsors, and the PGA Tour is in the midst of negotiating new deals with the sponsors of a dozen events that will expire by the end of 2010. Therefore, uncertainty about his availability will have a negative impact on the negotiations.

“We all know what kind of effect there is when he doesn’t play in tournaments, let alone taking time off,” the Hall of Famer Nick Price said. “The golf world is going to miss him.”

The main uncertainties facing the tour in 2010 depend on what the definition of “indefinite” turns out to be. In 2008, Woods played six events, including the United States Open, before he had surgery to repair his knee and missed about 10 tournaments, including two major championships.

Television ratings for golf during his absence were down by an average of 50 percent from 2007, and down a similar level for the two events he missed from the 2009 schedule before returning to the W.G.C.-Accenture World Match Play.

Was there an upside during the eight-month absence? There was the emergence of some new young stars. Anthony Kim, 24, and Camilo Villegas, 27, won twice  though neither has won again. And the veteran Steve Stricker rediscovered his game and rose to No. 2 in the world golf rankings. And Phil Mickelson, who regained the No. 2 spot with his win at the Tour Championship, re-established himself as clearly the second-best player in the world and the only player besides Woods capable of moving the needle.

Could Rory McIlroy, the 21-year-old sensation from Northern Ireland who will join the PGA Tour in 2010, become the new world star? Could Adam Scott, 29, who recently broke his slump with a win in Australia, ditch the matinee-idol work ethic and finally emerge as the golf star he was touted to be?

Those are large question marks attached to any upside possibility for golf without Tiger Woods. Since no one, probably including Woods, knows how many events he will miss in 2010, any forecast is guesswork. But should he miss six months the tournaments that would suffer most based on his playing schedules from 2005-09 include the San Diego Open, where he started four of five seasons since 2006 at Torrey Pines Golf Course; the W.G.C.-Accenture in Marana, Ariz.; the W.G.C.-CA Championship in Miami; the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla.; the Masters in Augusta, Ga.; the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte, N.C.; the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra, Fla.; and the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio.

It is doubtful Woods would play in the United States Open in Pebble Beach, Calif., without a prior competitive start. Should he choose to play the Open, he will probably play at the Memorial two weeks before Pebble Beach, where he set the United States Open record with a 15-stroke victory in 2000.

If Woods skips the entire season, he will also miss the remaining two major championships  the British Open at St. Andrews, and the P.G.A. Championship at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis.  and the AT&T, for which Woods is the host, at Aronimink Country Club near Philadelphia.

“Contrary to what everyone believes, the tour will go on,” the golfer Chris DiMarco said in an interview with PGATour.com. “Anytime you take the greatest competitor of all time out of the game, though, it will miss him.

“Sometimes you think he is superhuman, and he is with some of the things he’s done on the golf course. This is about Tiger and his family, though. Golf is secondary right now. We were without him and it was awful, but this is way worse. This is life. This is reality.”
533 2009-12-14 Accenture’s decision is another example of how risky it can be for corporations to base their marketing efforts on individual celebrities in an age when blogs, camera phones and the digital footprint left by the celebrities themselves can quickly expose their foibles to the world.

Earlier this year, Kellogg dropped its sponsorship of Michael Phelps, the gold-medal swimmer, after he was photographed using a bong at a party, saying, in language similar to Accenture’s, that his acts were not “consistent with the image of Kellogg.” In 2003, Nutella and McDonald’s ended their deals with Kobe Bryant after he was accused of sexual assault in Colorado; the charges were eventually dropped.

Among corporate pitchmen, however, Mr. Woods is unique. He dominates a sport for individuals that is marketed around the world while still being hugely popular in the United States, in contrast to sports like tennis.

More than any other athlete, Mr. Woods has built a billion-dollar brand around himself that has not only benefited him but has also made millions of dollars for his sponsors. Perhaps the best analogy for Mr. Woods’s predicament is not another athlete but Martha Stewart — another example of a billion-dollar brand based on the cultivated image of one person.

Ms. Stewart put her public company and television contracts at risk when she was convicted of lying to prosecutors about a minor stock deal. She emerged from her five-month sentence in prison to retake the reins at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, but the company has not returned to the financial heights it once enjoyed.

“Tiger is the best example of a walking, individual corporation,” said Ben Porritt, a public relations executive who advised Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees third baseman, last spring after his onetime steroid use was disclosed.

“Tiger is going to come out of this as somewhat of a bankrupt brand,” said Mr. Porritt. “He will have to restructure and go forward.” But, he said, “It’s going to be an ugly few months.”

Several companies that measure consumer reaction believe the ugliness has already started. Zeta Interactive, a digital ad agency that monitors message boards, blogs and social media posts, said that positive sentiment toward Mr. Woods had already plummeted. Before the accident, buzz about the golfer was 91 percent positive; by Friday, that figure had sunk to 43 percent.

The turnabout “is the quickest fall from positive to negative we’ve ever seen,” said Al DiGuido, chief executive at Zeta Interactive.

The Nielsen IAG unit of the Nielsen Company found that the accident quickly affected the brands Mr. Woods peddles. There were more than 20 instances through Monday, Dec. 7, of jokes being made on late-night talk shows that paired Mr. Woods with one of his sponsors by name, according to Nielsen IAG.

The recall among viewers of the brand mentioned in the joke was 55 percent, according to Nielsen IAG, compared with a norm in late-night shows of 39 percent.

About 11 percent of those viewers who recalled a brand with ties to Mr. Woods said they had a negative opinion of the brand, Nielsen IAG reported, compared with the average negative opinion of a brand mentioned in a late-night show of 6 percent.

David Arluck, an independent sports marketing executive, said that Accenture was in a different spot than other sponsors because it pitched a service to businesses, not consumers, and so it had centered its branding on Mr. Woods’s persona.

“In business, credibility means a lot and honesty means a lot, and Accenture wants to be a company that can be trusted,” he said. “Obviously Tiger Woods did some things that betrayed the trust of people who were close to him, and I can see how they would want to distance themselves from that.”

Even the most upright athletes seem to be aware of the tenuousness of image in the Internet age. On a recent evening in Manhattan, the Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter — a close friend of Mr. Woods — stood on a dais after receiving Sports Illustrated’s Sportsman of the Year award and was asked, essentially, how he was able to enjoy the perks of athletic superstardom for so many years and maintain his pitch-perfect image.
534 2009-12-14 At the 2009 Giro in May, the race’s 100th anniversary, he designed a spectacular, made-for-television course so demanding that some riders — including the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong — complained that some parts were too dangerous.

Zomegnan all but called them wimps, saying they may be “getting too old and no longer want to race in tough situations.” The riders were angered, but the race garnered more spectators and a larger television audience than ever.

“Bringing in extreme events brings more publicity for the sport, but he goes a little too far in creating a spectacle and he neglects the sporting element and the safety of the riders,” Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, said last week, adding that he had warned Zomegnan to keep the riders’ safety in mind.

“I understand his position of trying to create public interest, but this can’t go on,” McQuaid said. “If the Giro idea becomes realistic, we would definitely have a say in the structure of the race. We would make sure to protect the riders.”

McQuaid said that the priority for the cycling union would be for the riders to have enough time to overcome their jet lag. He said at least two to three days of rest in Italy would be necessary before the race continued. Zomegnan said one or two days would suffice.

“Normal people have jet lag,” Zomegnan said. “Normal people can’t run three weeks and 3,500 kilometers. The riders aren’t normal people.”

Still, the project is going forward. Mark Sommers, a lawyer who is head of the group working to bring the race to Washington, said the city and Giro organizers had a “tentative agreement.” Over the next several weeks, Giro officials will speak to tourism, safety and city officials to complete details.

The proposed course for both stages would remain inside the city, passing buildings and monuments that have a link to Italy, Sommers said. One of those sites includes the Memorial Bridge, which connects Virginia and Washington. The statues at one end were gifts from Italy to the United States in 1950.

“Angelo doesn’t want the race to be Italian-centric; he’s more universal than that,” Sommers said. “He has a larger mission to build the brand and the sport outside of Europe. He’s inventive. You’ve got to love that.”

That feat of holding two Giro stages in Washington would be a logistical marvel, requiring 198 riders and several hundred Giro and team staff to fly eight hours and traverse five time zones before the race resumes on Italian soil, in Rome. The bicycles, each worth thousands of dollars, would ride along.

Other sports have already accomplished something similar, to different degrees. Major League Baseball has played regular-season games in Japan, and the N.H.L. has done so in Europe. The N.F.L. has played regular-season games in London.

But none of those sports are quite like the Giro, one of cycling’s three Grand Tours — races that require riders to have nearly superhuman resilience as they endure physical pain day after day for three weeks. It is a triumph just to make it to the finish. None of the Grand Tours, which include the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, have ever started outside Europe. But several times, Tour organizers have toyed with the idea.

In the 1980s, a New York start for the Tour was considered, but dropped because there were not enough Concordes to fly the riders back to France. In 2008, a start in Quebec City would have been part of the city’s 400th anniversary, but Tour organizers balked.

“It would be like asking the Formula One people to hold their time trials in Canada and then having the Grand Prix race run in Europe,” the Tour official Jean-François Pescheux told La Presse, a newspaper in Montreal, during those negotiations. “The idea has been studied, the potential is there, everything is there, but we can’t allow it.”

Zomegnan, however, says he does not see any problems with his plan. He tried to bring the race’s start to New York for the Giro’s anniversary, but decided against it because of the lagging economy. He then began working with Robin Morton, who runs an event planning and production company in New Jersey, to try again. They ended up in Washington.

“There’s so many events that come to the city of New York, whether it’s sporting events or global functions, I guess New York didn’t want to pursue our plan,” said Morton, who was the manager of the 1984 Gianni-Motta team, the first American-based team at the Giro. “But Mayor Fenty is a big cycling fan, and the city is also trying to raise its profile. It was a good fit.”

Some riders, including the Garmin-Transitions team leader Christian Vande Velde, say the plan not only is feasible, but it may also be fun.

“I think if you are intelligent about the whole matter and are civil to the riders, it would be beautiful and really cool, and it would bring a lot of recognition for our sport,” Vande Velde said. “It’s a crazy idea, but it could work.

“But, of course, there’s a fine line between crazy stupid and crazy spectacular,” he added. ”I’m supportive of it, within reason.”
535 2009-12-14 Mr. McCain has even been a bit at odds with his closest friends on the campaign trail, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, attacking a global warming bill that they proposed along with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, though Mr. Graham said he and Mr. McCain remained as close as ever.

“His presidential aspirations are over — he knows he’s never going to be president,” Mr. Graham said. “Most people in that position have a hard time re-engaging, but he’s really engaged. I’ve never seen him like this before. He’s really going down there, he’s really making it tough for them.”

Mr. McCain, who did not respond to a request for an interview, told advisers the day after he lost to Barack Obama that he intended to seek a fifth term in the Senate. Yet he is facing a threatened primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth, a conservative talk show host and former Republican member of Congress, who said he was encouraged by polls that showed Mr. McCain was vulnerable.

“The question that people are asking is this,” Mr. Hayworth said in an interview. “Do we want to send John McCain back to the United States Senate again, or is it time to change to a clear, consistent, common-sense Republican?”

Don Bivens, the chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, said he believed that Mr. McCain would be vulnerable in a general election, though as of now, the Democrats’ best candidate is a little-known city councilman from Tucson.

“I think he’s taken a hard turn to the right,” Mr. Bivens said of Mr. McCain. “There’s no maverick left. There’s no bipartisan guy left. He’s just sort of a Republican attack dog, and as a result I think he’s made himself vulnerable here because we’re pretty much a middle-of-the-road kind of state.”

Mr. McCain’s friends said that in raising his profile, he was motivated not by concern at home, but by philosophical differences over the scope of Mr. Obama’s health care proposals and spending measures.

“Had they reached out to him in a more genuine way, and not tried to pursue a pretty leftist agenda, I think they might have had a potential ally in John on certain things,” said Senator Jon Kyl, Mr. McCain’s fellow Republican from Arizona.

Mr. Salter said: “I think he’s doing what anybody who knew him knew he would do. He deals with loss, he deals with adversity, he deals with everything by being active when it’s over. Whether he won or lost. He wasn’t going to go back and stare out the window or anything.”

But Mr. McCain has also distanced himself from some long-held positions: he once backed measures to deal with climate change, which made his criticism of Mr. Graham’s bill so striking. He denounced efforts to curb Medicare costs by Congressional Democrats a year after he said such cuts were critical.

Mr. McCain pointedly praised Ms. Palin after she recently released a book attacking his former campaign aides, putting him in the position of embracing someone who has become the symbol of the wing of the party he has long warned against.

And these days he is regularly at the side the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican from Kentucky who almost did not endorse Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign because of Mr. McCain’s history of breaking with conservatives on issues like immigration and tax cuts.

“I’ll leave others to interpret what some might call a campaign conversion,” Mr. Hayworth said.

If Mr. McCain has had a history of being a happy warrior, that is not the phrase used by many of his friends to describe his demeanor these days. There are few glimpses of the winks, wry smiles and one-liners that were once an integral part of his character. More typically, his remarks are tinged with sarcasm or anger, delivered with a wave of the arm or both hands chopping through the air, like those he delivered Friday, when he declared that a report on Medicare benefits “should put a dagger in the heart of the Reid bill.”

Some of his associates noted similarities between Mr. McCain’s current demeanor and the way he handled himself in 2001, when he returned to the Senate after losing the 2000 Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush. He voted against Mr. Bush’s first round of tax cuts and was one of his toughest critics, though Mr. McCain grew closer to Mr. Bush as he began preparing for his own second race for the presidency.

“I think there’s always going to be some maverick to McCain which makes him unpredictable and hard to pin down,” said Mark McKinnon, a longtime adviser. ”Which is what makes him so interesting. The book on McCain is far from over.”
536 2009-12-14 The main reason for the shift in thinking is right there on the stacks of Blu-ray players that Best Buy has piled at its video wall. Prices for high-quality models have dropped below $150, a steep drop from the $300-plus that retailers were charging when Blu-ray had its debut.

“The price for an impulse buy is under $100, and we’re getting there,” said Andy Parsons, president of the Blu-ray Disc Association, a trade group.

Amazon’s best-selling Blu-ray model, Panasonic’s DMP-BD60, is available for $129, while a no-frills Magnavox Blu-ray player is on sale at Wal-Mart Stores for $78.

“We’re sanguine about Blu-ray taking over as the physical disc format of choice,” said Tom Adams, the president of Adams Media Research. “The differences in cost between DVD and Blu-ray players and software is going away. So there will be a natural evolution from standard DVD to Blu-ray.”

It also helps that more Americans now have 1080p HDTV displays, sets with sufficiently high screen resolution to fully display the clarity of a Blu-ray disc. Forty percent of all TVs sold are 1080p, according to Riddhi Patel, an analyst at iSuppli. She says that number should rise to 46 percent next year.

In addition to superior picture quality, Blu-ray also offers features not available on standard DVD players, like pop-up menus during play. Some Blu-ray players can also connect to the Internet; the player can then receive additional information about a movie, offer movie-related games, provide updated trailers, and allow friends to simultaneously watch a film while writing comments on screen.

The newest generation of Blu-ray players lets viewers receive streaming movies and TV shows from online providers like Amazon Video on Demand, CinemaNow, Netflix and YouTube.

As a result, Blu-ray manufacturers have placed themselves in a seemingly awkward position: They are selling a device that relies on people to continue to buy discs, but the same device gives them a way to download videos — bypassing the discs the machines were built to play.

Consumer electronics companies believe that this strategy makes sense. The additional programming will add to the Blu-ray experience, executives say, which still offers superior picture and sound quality to what can be currently streamed over the Internet.

And since most HDTVs do not yet come with their own built-in Internet capability, a Blu-ray player can become an inexpensive but essential all-in-one content source, according to Todd Richardson, senior vice president for P&F USA, the marketing arm for Philips.

“These services are supplemental. They fill out the consumers’ demand for more and more content,” added Tim Alessi, LG’s director of new product development.

Yet, as high-speed broadband becomes ubiquitous, the ability to quickly download Blu-ray-quality content will become a reality. That day is probably 10 years off, according to Ross Rubin, an NPD Group analyst, as physical discs continue to provide a higher-quality image and an easier way to move programming throughout the house than by trying to create an in-home network.

But the consumer electronics industry is no stranger to product life cycles and planned obsolescence. Already, manufacturers are readying a new line of Blu-ray players and TVs that can display video in 3-D. They should be in place by next year’s holiday shopping season.
537 2009-12-14 The apparent shift underscores the fact that mobile phones are quickly becoming the biggest technology battleground of the future, as consumers increasingly rely on their phones to browse the Internet and perform other computing tasks.

It also indicates Google’s determination to make its mark on yet another industry, as it has done previously in advertising, books and online videos.

But analysts say it is not clear that Google’s success on the Internet will carry over into the design, marketing and distribution of hardware. Many companies have tried to make similar shifts and stumbled. turned the Xbox into a hit, but when it pushed aside its partners in the -player business in favor of its own Zune, it failed to gain traction against Apple and its iPods.

The phone’s success could also depend on how Google chooses to price it. Most Americans buy phones that are subsidized by wireless carriers, which recoup that cost by locking customers into contracts. IPhones that cost consumers $199 actually cost about $550, analysts say.

Katie Watson, a Google spokeswoman, declined to comment on the company’s plans. She referred reporters to a blog post published Saturday in which Google said that the new device was a “mobile lab” that would let employees test out new technologies.

Google employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because plans for the phone were supposed to be confidential said that the device, manufactured by the Taiwanese company HTC, was thinner than Apple’s , with a slightly larger touch screen. It could be available as early as January, they said.

Employees say the phone will be sold unlocked, meaning that buyers will be able to choose a service provider, and will be based on G.S.M. technology, which is used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States and by most other carriers around the world. It is named Nexus One, according to various reports and to digital traces that the phones have been leaving on Web sites.

Google had long insisted that it was not interested in building and selling phones, saying it preferred to rely on hardware partners and wireless carriers to market a wide variety of phones powered by Android, the operating system that it offers free.

In October, Andy Rubin, vice president of engineering for Android at Google, scoffed at the idea that the company would “compete with its customers” by releasing its own phone, according to the technology news service CNet.

Analysts say that the apparent shift signals a recognition by the company’s executives that Google needs to take more control of its destiny in the wireless world.

“They perceive mobile as the next major opportunity,” said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “It is too big a risk to drive the strategy through their partners. They want more say and more control.”

In addition, analysts say that the iPhone, despite prominently featuring some Google services, makes the company nervous.

“They don’t want to have access to Google being controlled or influenced by one player like Apple,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Broadpoint AmTech, a research firm.

Google wants to get more people using Web-friendly phones in part because it depends on the growth of search advertising, which is slowing on PCs. On cellphones, however, use of Google’s mobile search engine grew 30 percent in six months this year, Mr. Schachter said. “That’s huge, and a majority of that growth is coming from the iPhone,” he said. “When that happens, Apple has a lot of power over influencing users’ behavior.”

Until recently, Google and Apple were considered close allies with a common enemy: Microsoft. They shared two board members, , the chairman and chief executive of Google, and Arthur Levinson, the former chief executive of Genentech.

But the rise of mobile phones has increasingly pitted the two companies against each other. More than a year ago, Mr. Schmidt began recusing himself from discussions of the iPhone in Apple board meetings.

Google and Apple compete in other areas, like online distribution of music and video, Web browsers, and soon, computer operating systems. But it is in mobile phones that the two companies appear to be battling most aggressively. In recent weeks, Google has unveiled a string of cutting-edge services for smartphones that run Android. They included an application that gives turn-by-turn driving directions, which Google is giving away free. A comparable application from the satellite navigation company TomTom for the iPhone costs $99.

“Finally, Apple will meet a worthy competitor,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Northeast Securities, who predicted two months ago that Google would develop and market its own phone.

Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment on Google’s plans.

Analysts say that Google’s gamble is a risky one, in particular because it could alienate Google’s Android partners, which include handset makers like and Samsung, and carriers like Wireless, and T-Mobile.

Those partners are largely responsible for the recent momentum of Android. They have introduced a handful of new devices in recent months, including the Motorola Droid, a well-reviewed and powerful device. But Android phones continue to be outsold by the iPhone, which is also the phone of choice for developers of tens of thousands of cellphone applications.

Analysts say Google may believe that only its own backing could make Android into a serious competitor to the iPhone, which for now in the United States is available only through AT&T. That exclusivity is expected to end next year if the deal is not renewed.

It is not clear whether Google will team up with carriers to sell service plans for the phone, or whether Google will subsidize the devices in the hope of making up the difference with profits from mobile advertising.

“If it is not subsidized, then I suspect the impact will be small,” said Charles S. Golvin, a wireless industry analyst at . Mr. Golvin said that had tried to sell unsubsidized high-end phones in the United States without much success. “If they choose to sell it subsidized, then the impact could be very, very significant,” he added.

Analysts also said that Google’s gambit might be aimed at important overseas markets, where unlocked, unsubsidized phones tend to be the norm.

Mr. Kumar said that while Google’s plans may upset carriers, the company could find ways to placate them and to continue to work with them. “As long as Google provides a platform that the carriers can profit from, they will be happy participants,” he said. “Google could share profits from advertising with the carriers.”

Much will depend, of course, on how appealing the phone is. Some people who say they have had an early look have gushed about it on , with one calling it “a sexy beast.”
538 2009-12-14 If you listen to consumer electronics manufacturers, every year is the best year to buy a new TV. But this year is significant, as prices of several sizes of flat-panel TVs now cost the same as their picture-tube predecessors.

According to iSuppli, a research firm, the average selling price of a 23-inch LCD set is $451; three years ago it was $752. The average price of a 32-inch LCD is $600, about half of the $1,182 ticket in 2006.

In the stores, flat-panel prices are even better. Wal-Mart is selling a 32-inch Vizio LCD for $400, and a 22-inch HDTV from RCA for $250.

The price reductions are great for consumers, but not so good for the companies that manufacture the sets. “The manufacturers needed to keep sales momentum going when people cut back on spending, so they’re lowering prices,” said Riddhi Patel, an analyst at iSuppli. “They’re just trying to see if they can survive one more quarter.”

In addition, with less disposable income since the recession, consumers have cut back by buying smaller, less fancy TVs. “Entry-level price points have become more attractive to consumers,” said Bob Perry, Panasonic’s senior vice president for marketing. “There was the assumption that fewer 32-inch LCD TVs would be sold, but more were sold and that drove down prices.”

According to Paul Semenza, vice president at market researcher DisplaySearch, price cuts are occurring even while the cost of the LCD panels used in the TVs has risen. Because mass merchants can survive with smaller margins, the large retailers have been able to lower prices to keep sales going.

569 2009-12-15 “I have no place to go if things fall through,” she said.

Ms. Winchell, of Latham, N.Y., was laid off in January — the day after President Obama’s inauguration, she recalls — as an administrative assistant in an information technology department at a health insurance company.

She had been with the company nine years and had just volunteered to work the previous Saturday, the day a software project that her department had worked on was being tested. But the company decided to restructure to save costs.

“I was summoned downstairs and told my position was eliminated and told I had to leave right then,” she said.

She had just begun to dig out from filing for bankruptcy the year before, when she had fallen behind on credit card payments after some unexpectedly large bills.

In two previous layoffs, she was always able to find temporary jobs until she landed work again. But this time, because of some health issues with allergies and medications she needs, she is focused on finding a full-time job with benefits.

Now she worries that the subsidy she has been receiving from the government to help pay for her health insurance premiums is about to expire.

“You just get anxious and fearful,” she said. “Some days, you just don’t feel right because there’s this big cloud of uncertainty.”

Lee Daves, 54, is coming to the end of his unemployment benefits and is not sure what he will do next.

“I’m going to find something soon,” he said. “I have to. It may not be what I want. If I have to wash dishes, that’s what I’ll do. Hopefully I can do better than that.”

Mr. Daves, of Springfield, Mo., was laid off in January from a small glass company where he operated a machine that created bevels on mirrors. He lived fairly frugally, owning a mobile home and paying rent only for the lot.

But his unemployment benefits still failed to cover his expenses. He was forced to liquidate a meager 401(k) retirement account and believes he has enough savings to last a few more months.

His old job paid $13 an hour. He has lowered his sights to anything that pays around $9 an hour, which would almost equal his unemployment benefits. But once he exhausts his benefits, he said, he will have to resort to finding something that pays the minimum wage.

“I have a lot of confidence that I can find something that will at least slow the bleeding,” he said.

He has had trouble sleeping because of the stress, saying he is “generally in a depressed state.” He gets some health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he has had to neglect things like dental work and figures he will probably need to have some teeth removed when — make that if — he gets a job with benefits again.
570 2009-12-15 Computer technicians have found 22 million missing White House e-mail messages from 94 days in the administration of President George W. Bush, and the Obama administration is searching for more potentially lost e-mail from the Bush years, according to two groups that filed suit over the failure by the Bush White House to install an electronic record-keeping system. The groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, said they were settling the lawsuits they filed in 2007. It will be 2014 at the earliest before the public sees any of the messages because they must go through the National Archives’ process for releasing presidential and agency records.
571 2009-12-15 DENVER (AP) — The Colorado Supreme Court ruled Monday that the authorities violated the constitutional and privacy rights of people suspected of being illegal immigrants when they used tax returns to try to build hundreds of identity-theft cases against them.

The 4-to-3 ruling affirmed a decision by a Weld County district judge who had suppressed evidence against one of the defendants. In that case, investigators had raided a tax business that catered to Latinos in Greeley, an agricultural city on the northern plains of Colorado with a heavily Hispanic population.

The investigation was the first and only time that the authorities used tax returns, which are confidential under federal law, to prosecute people suspected of being illegal immigrants.

A favorable ruling for Weld County could have given prosecutors a new tool to find and prosecute illegal immigrants, who are required to pay taxes despite their illegal status.
572 2009-12-15 Ever since electronic books emerged as a major growth market, New York’s largest publishing houses have worried that big-name authors might sign deals directly with e-book retailers or other new ventures, bypassing traditional publishers entirely.

Now, one well-known author is doing just that.

Stephen R. Covey, one of the most successful business authors of the last two decades, has moved e-book rights for two of his best-selling books from his print publisher, Simon & Schuster, a division of the CBS Corporation, to a digital publisher that will sell the e-books to Amazon.com for one year.

Amazon, maker of the popular Kindle e-reader and one of the biggest book retailers in the country, will have the exclusive rights to sell electronic editions of “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” and a later work, “Principle-Centered Leadership.” Mr. Covey also plans to gradually make other e-books available exclusively to Amazon, which will promote them on its Web site.

The move promises to raise the already high anxiety level among publishers about the economics of digital publishing and could offer authors a way to earn more profits from their works than they do under the traditional system.

Mr. Covey is making his books available to Amazon through RosettaBooks, an electronic book publisher that primarily traffics in the older works of authors like Kurt Vonnegut and Virginia Woolf.

Arthur Klebanoff, chief executive of RosettaBooks, said that Mr. Covey would receive more than half of the net proceeds that RosettaBooks took in from Amazon on these e-book sales. In contrast, the standard digital royalty from mainstream publishers is 25 percent of net proceeds.

“There are superstars, and superstars are entitled to more,” Mr. Klebanoff said.

Sean Covey, a son of Mr. Covey and chief innovation officer for Franklin Covey, a training and consulting firm that also publishes business books, said that the higher royalty rate was “a factor” in the decision to switch to RosettaBooks.

The elder Mr. Covey was also particularly attracted by Amazon’s plans to heavily promote the e-book editions of both “7 Habits” and “Principle-Centered Leadership.”

His move comes as publishers ratchet up their efforts to secure the digital rights to so-called backlist titles  books published many years, if not decades, ago. These books can be vitally important to publishing houses because they are reprinted year after year and provide a stream of guaranteed revenue without much extra marketing effort.

“The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” originally published in hardcover in 1989, is a steady seller for Simon & Schuster. This year alone, it has sold 136,000 copies in paperback, according to Nielsen BookScan, which generally tracks about 70 percent of sales.

Many authors and agents say that because the contracts for older books do not explicitly spell out electronic rights, they reside with the author. Big publishing houses argue that clauses like “in book form” or phrases that prohibit “competitive editions” preclude authors from publishing e-books through other parties.

Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, declined to comment directly on Mr. Covey’s moves, but said, “Our position is that electronic editions of our backlist titles belong in the Simon & Schuster catalog, and we intend to protect our interests in those publications.”

Other publishers have moved to stake their claim on e-book rights for older titles. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents stating that on all backlist books, it retained “the exclusive right to publish in electronic book publishing formats.”

Sean Covey said the decision to publish the e-book editions of the two older titles through RosettaBooks and Amazon was not a result of dissatisfaction with Simon & Schuster. He noted that both he and his father had continued to publish books through Simon & Schuster and would do so in the future.

But the younger Mr. Covey noted that Franklin Covey was also experimenting with self-publishing new books, another way of cutting out the traditional print publisher. In August, the company published “Predictable Results in Unpredictable Times” by Stephen R. Covey, Bob Whitman and Breck England. It released an e-book edition through RosettaBooks and exclusively for the Kindle.

Sean Covey said that his father was co-author of another book, “Great Work, Great Career” that Franklin Covey was self-publishing. Amazon is taking pre-orders for it. That book will also be released in an exclusive Kindle e-book edition.
573 2009-12-15 Steven Rattner, the former private equity executive and adviser to the Obama administration, will not be stepping away from his keyboard any time soon. On Monday Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said that it had acquired a new book by Mr. Rattner, who until July headed the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, about the government’s efforts to bail out the Chrysler Corporation and General Motors. In a news release, the publisher said that the book, titled “Overhaul” and planned for publication next fall, “will tell the story of the intense 150-day struggle to save the American auto industry, as both Chrysler and GM struggled to stay afloat.” Mr. Rattner, who left the media-focused leveraged buyout firm the Quadrangle Group to join the task force in February, has worked as a financial reporter for The New York Times and as a mergers and acquisitions specialist at Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Lazard. Financial disclosures released by the government revealed that Mr. Rattner was an investor in Cerberus Capital Management, which owned the majority of Chrysler and GMAC. Quadrangle was tied to an inquiry involving the New York State pension fund, but Mr. Rattner was not charged with wrongdoing.
574 2009-12-15 Three Hollywood legends — actually four, if you count the publicist involved, the venerable Pat Kingsley — are working to bring Philip Roth’s most recent novel to the multiplex. Al Pacino, right, has purchased the movie rights to “The Humbling,” about an aging, declining stage actor who finds hope of renewal through a younger woman. Mr. Pacino, who has never optioned a book before, will play the lead, according to Ms. Kingsley. The director will be Barry Levinson, who won an Oscar for “Rain Man” and was nominated for “Bugsy.” (More recently, he has been producing television, including the HBO prison series, “Oz.”) Buck Henry, who just turned 79, is writing the screenplay, Ms. Kingsley said. Mr. Henry is best known for writing “The Graduate,” and his other credits range from the original “Get Smart” television series to “To Die For,” starring Nicole Kidman. “The book is perfect for him” — Mr. Pacino — “because he has a love of the stage, and although he has never personally experienced these feelings, he understands them,” Ms. Kingsley said. Although “The Humbling” received mixed critical notices, Mr. Roth, of course, has won pretty much every writing honor available other than the Nobel Prize, including the National Book Award (twice) and a Pulitzer Prize.
575 2009-12-15 What makes Harpreet Singh Bedi run? Honesty — the same quality that makes him seem like a zero to his blithely corrupt boss. But that boss isn’t the villain in Shimit Amin’s “Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year,” a smart, focused Bollywood movie. That honor goes to Business as Usual, which Mr. Amin portrays as fundamentally dishonest, fueled by bribes and payoffs.

Mr. Amin, who directed the delightful “Chak De! India,” about a girls’ field hockey team, dispenses with Bollywood’s normal tangle of subplots and mashup of genres. There’s music, but no big production numbers. Even romance is back-burnered. Instead, Mr. Amin sticks to the story at hand.

Harpreet (Ranbir Kapoor) gets a job at a Mumbai firm that sells and services computers. When a client offers him a bribe, he blows the whistle and, for his troubles, becomes the office whipping boy.

Harpreet starts his own secret business on the side, run on hard work and honesty. A Sikh, he forms a kind of Indian rainbow coalition when he brings in partners: the beautiful receptionist who has been passed up for promotion; the man who serves tea and is dismissively called Cup-Plate; and even a snaky salesman, who comes to appreciate doing business Harpreet’s way.

It’s no accident that when the partners hold a rooftop meeting, they’re framed by the words “United India” on an adjacent building.

Mr. Kapoor, a heartthrob who has quickly become a star playing cads, turns in a skillfully understated performance. His Harpreet is an old-school hero: solid, righteous, compassionate. You can’t help cheering for him.
576 2009-12-15 Suicide among AIDS patients in Switzerland dropped by more than 50 percent after they started getting antiretroviral drugs in 1996, a recent Swiss study has found.

Virtually all Swiss AIDS patients get the medicine they need, but the study may prove significant in the third world as well. There is an active debate in wealthy donor nations about whether it makes sense to provide poorer countries with costly antiretroviral drugs instead of cheaper lifesaving goods like antibiotics, mosquito nets and water filters.

Although the suicide rate is still higher than normal among Swiss AIDS patients, 62 percent of those who killed themselves also had a mental illness, said Olivia Keiser, an H.I.V. expert at the University of Bern and the lead author of the study, to be published online Tuesday in The American Journal of Psychiatry.

Asked if she thought she would find similar results in African countries with high AIDS rates, Dr. Keiser said there was no way to know because there was so little data on suicide in Africa.

But a recent study by Lourens Schlebusch, a psychology professor at the Nelson R. Mandela medical school at the University of Natal, found that suicide rates had soared among black youth in South Africa in the last decade.

Academic problems, incest, stress and depression were the leading causes, but those infected with AIDS were 36 times as likely as others to commit suicide, Professor Schlebusch said.

578 2009-12-15 “Sometimes, we will have the most impact by publicly denouncing a government action, like the coup in Honduras or the violence in Guinea,” she told a group of students. “Other times, we will be more likely to help the oppressed by engaging in tough negotiations behind closed doors, like pressing China and Russia as part of our broader agenda.”

“In every instance,” Mrs. Clinton said, “our aim will be to make a difference, not prove a point.”

Human-rights groups harshly criticized Mrs. Clinton for sidelining human rights issues on her first visit to China last February. Other critics have voiced frustration with the administration’s policy toward Sudan, an approach that they say offers more incentives than prods to a government whose leader has been charged with crimes against humanity because of the genocide in Darfur.

Last Thursday, a group of human rights advocates met with Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, to express their concerns.

On Monday, Mrs. Clinton said, “We must continue to press for solutions in Sudan where ongoing tensions threaten to add to the devastation wrought by genocide in Darfur.” She insisted that the administration would seek to protect ethnic minorities in Tibet and the Xinjiang region in China, as well as people who signed Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reform in China.

Mrs. Clinton’s specific reference to the signatories of Charter 08 was worthy of praise, said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.

But he argued the administration was still wrong to believe that publicly airing concerns about human rights would somehow undermine the relationship between Washington and Beijing.

“The perception in China is that the United States is confronting the government less on human rights because we owe them money,” Mr. Malinowski said in a telephone interview. “Every sign of reticence on human rights becomes a metaphor for American weakness.”

Over all, however, he said he had detected promising signs in the administration’s approach to human rights. After early wavering, for example, Mr. Obama struck a balance between supporting the human-rights goals of Iranian opposition figures while not appearing to side with any faction, he said.

There has been an evolution, Mr. Malinowski said, from seeking engagement to seeking engagement with the threat of pressure to back it up.

Critics point out that the State Department has cut funding for several nonprofit groups that track human-rights abuses in Iran, though others say these groups had little to do with advancing democracy there.

While Mrs. Clinton said the United States would press for democracy around the world, she linked it to development — avoiding the sometimes single-minded emphasis of the Bush administration on freedom.

In describing a policy of “principled pragmatism,” Mrs. Clinton said the United States would approach situations flexibly, depending on the circumstances. She grouped countries into three categories: those that would like to protect human rights, but are unable to (young African democracies); those that could do better, but choose not to (Cuba and Nigeria); and those that are neither willing nor able to protect their citizens (Congo).

Mrs. Clinton showed a rare flash of passion in discussing the systematic rape of girls and young women in Congo, which she visited in August. She also singled out for criticism Uganda, which is considering a law that would make homosexual conduct a criminal offense.

In its low-key tone, Mrs. Clinton’s speech was a stark contrast to the impassioned speech she gave as first lady at a United Nations women’s conference in Beijing in 1995. But administration officials said Mrs. Clinton’s goal was not rhetoric but a road map to follow Mr. Obama’s big themes.

“The world still looks to the United States to be a force in human rights,” said Michael H. Posner, an assistant secretary of state who oversees human rights. “But we are in a world where governments, as a whole, have less power than they once did. Let’s take the world as we now see it.”
579 2009-12-15 Easing concerns about debt problems overseas nudged major stock indexes to new highs for the year.

The market climbed on Monday after the news that Abu Dhabi had extended $10 billion to nearby Dubai to help the emirate make debt payments. Analysts have been concerned since last month that a cash crisis in Dubai could have repercussions in global credit markets.

In addition, Exxon Mobil said it would acquire XTO Energy to help it tap into the growing supply of natural gas — a move that could signal more deals in the energy industry.

A drop in shares of Exxon held the Dow Jones industrial average to more modest gains than other indexes. The Dow added 29.55 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 10,501.05. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 7.7 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,114.11, while the Nasdaq composite gained 21.79 points, or nearly 1 percent, to end at 2,212.10.

Financial stocks rose after Citigroup said it would repay the $20 billion it received last year from the government’s financial rescue program. The government also will sell its 34 percent stake in the company. The news came just days after Bank of America repaid the $45 billion in bailout money it owed taxpayers.

The day’s advance was orderly and signaled that traders remained cautious, as they have for weeks. A big run in stocks that began in March has slowed in the last month as investors look to lock in some of their gains from 2009 and determine how to position themselves for the new year. The S.& P. 500 index is up 1.7 percent so far this month, after a 5.7 percent gain in November and a 64.7 percent jump since early March.
580 2009-12-15 But the prospect of huge losses on and commercial real estate early next year might also be causing the repayment stampede, he said.

“It may be as much about raising capital as it is paying off TARP,” he said.

While bank profits surged this year as the economy recovered and the stock market rebounded, many banks were fearful of what next year might bring and wanted to raise money in the capital markets now.

Although the has ended, high unemployment means banks like Wells and Citigroup, which aggressively peddled consumer loans, will face looming losses as consumers struggle to make ends meet. The stock market is also likely to level off after a breakneck year, analysts said.

Any sudden event on the world stage, like a further weakening in emerging markets or a sovereign default, could restrain the environment for raising capital.

Only nine months ago, big institutional investors were so fearful during the that they refused to pour money into the banks that badly needed it. Talk of nationalization prevailed.

But confidence has come back to the market, in part because the government has shown its willingness to save large banks whose demise would produce systemic risks after the fall of .

Yet even as banks pay back their bailout money, the government is still extending them billions of dollars in taxpayer support through other programs run by the Federal Reserve and the .

In spite of the recent rush to repay the government, many financial experts say the financial system is sound. At both Citigroup and Wells Fargo, regulators required the banks to swap in private money almost dollar for dollar with the bailout funds.

“You are talking about them having about the same amount of capital and less of a government role, which the markets will like,” said Douglas J. Elliott, a former banker and fellow at the .

Even so, other financial experts worry that the government may be making a terrible mistake by allowing the biggest banks to exit too quickly.

If the economy takes a turn for the worse, they argue, these same large banks will return to the government for a new round of aid.

“The guarantee is no longer explicit, it’s implicit — just like the implicit guarantee for and ,” said Dino Kos, a banking analyst and former Federal Reserve official. “This is the nature of the ‘too big to fail’ problem.”

For the banks’ existing stockholders, repayment comes at a high cost. As part of Citigroup’s agreement with the government, the bank is planning to raise about $17 billion by selling stock, which will dilute the value of existing shares.

“It’s terribly negative,” said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities. “Management has shown that it is willing to take any action to harm shareholders as long as the executives get paid more money.”

Mr. Bove said the payback did nothing to improve Citigroup’s overall financial health, nor did it remove the bank entirely from government control. Instead, Citigroup’s management had “ruined” the stock price for the next three or four months, he said.

On Monday, Citi’s stock lost 25 cents and closed at $3.70.

Citigroup will still operate under a loose set of pay restrictions. By contrast, Wells will now face no pay restrictions since it will have fully repaid its bailout funds. But that may hold less significance, because Wells, a commercial bank, does not have the traders and bankers who demand multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses.

That became a sore point for Wells when , then the secretary, summoned its chief executive to appear last October with seven others at the Treasury Department.

At the meeting, Richard M. Kovacevich, then the Wells Fargo chairman, protested strongly that, unlike its New York rivals, Wells was not in trouble because of investments in exotic mortgages, and did not need a bailout, according to people briefed on the meeting.

But Wells has since changed its tune as it struggles to digest Wachovia, which it took over at the height of the financial crisis after a heated fight with Citigroup. After that merger, Wells was saddled with a giant portfolio of troubled real estate loans, and it faces a coming wave of losses on its pick-a-pay mortgages and commercial real estate and corporate loans.

Under the terms of the deal, Wells will raise $1.35 billion by issuing common stock to Wells benefit plans. The bank will also increase equity by $1.5 billion through asset sales.

Wells’s current chief executive, John G. Stumpf, said the move was a good deal for investors and taxpayers, who walk away from their investment in the bank with a $1.4 billion dividend.
581 2009-12-15 Drinking alcohol can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, and a study suggests that breast cancer survivors who consume just a few drinks a week may be more likely to experience a recurrence than nondrinkers.

Researchers from Kaiser Permanente followed 1,897 women who received a diagnosis of early-stage invasive breast cancer from 1997 to 2000, assessing alcohol intake through a self-administered food frequency questionnaire listing 122 foods and beverages.

About half of the women reported drinking alcohol; wine was the most popular choice. After eight years of follow-up, 349 women had had a recurrence of breast cancer, and 332 had died of cancer or other causes. Researchers found that the women who drank three to four standard servings of alcohol a week — the equivalent of three to four glasses of wine — were 34 percent more likely to have experienced a recurrence of their cancer than those who drank very little or not at all, with the risk greater among post-menopausal and overweight women.

“Alcohol has been shown in animal studies to increase circulating levels of estrogen, and increase estrogen metabolism,” which may drive recurrence risk, said the paper’s lead author, Marilyn Kwan, a staff scientist in the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, Calif., who presented the findings at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last week.

It may be premature to issue clinical recommendations, but she suggested that cutting down on alcohol was “one of the modifiable lifestyle factors that women with breast cancer should consider.”

610 2009-12-16 “We think the secret of good mass merchandising is the intelligent loss of sales,” Mr. Price told The New York Times in 1986. “It means you have to decide what sales you are prepared to live without. Can you live without credit cards that cost you two points? Can you live without advertising? Can you live without $35-to-$40-a-foot occupancy costs for a prime location?”

Mr. Price made it up in volume. By 1993, shortly before merging with Costco, Price Club comprised 94 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with annual revenue of more than $6 billion. Mr. Price, who was long active in philanthropic affairs, had an estimated net worth of $500 million, The San Diego Business Journal reported in 2006.

Sol Price was born in the Bronx on Jan 23, 1916. His parents worked in New York City’s garment industry. (The original family surname has been lost to time. It was changed, prophetically, to Price at Ellis Island.) After moving with his family to San Diego as a youth, he did undergraduate study at several colleges before earning a law degree from the University of Southern California in the late 1930s.

Mr. Price worked as a business lawyer in San Diego before starting FedMart, a local discount warehouse, with several partners in 1954. Membership in FedMart, which eventually sold liquor, pharmacy items, household goods and premium gasoline, cost $2 and was limited to government employees and their families. (At first, the $2 fee bought membership for life, but the term was later changed to a year.) The FedMart chain grew to include more than 40 stores throughout the Southwest.

In the mid-1970s FedMart was sold to a German retailer, and before long, at the age of 59, Mr. Price found himself out of a job. He and his son founded Price Club, which was originally aimed at small-business owners. For an annual membership fee of $25, for instance, an accountant could buy inexpensive office stationery, or a saloonkeeper could buy cigarettes and toilet paper.

In its first year, Mr. Price’s business lost $750,000. Only after membership was extended to the general consumer did it began to thrive, and before long Price Club had become an integral part of the American retail experience.

Vast, concrete-floored and teeming with shopping carts, Price Clubs exuded a certain spartan cachet. Industrial shelves were stocked with a variety of products, including cigarettes, auto parts, alcohol, clothing, Robert Ludlum paperbacks, Rolex Oyster watches, 10-pound bags of rice and gallon jars of mayonnaise.

For a time, many Price Club warehouses had attached tire installation centers, an operation owned by Mr. Price’s son Laurence. But in a widely reported feud with his father, Laurence Price filed for arbitration after Sol Price canceled the leases on those centers in 1985; Laurence was awarded $3.7 million.

In 1987 Laurence Price sued his father for emotional distress, contending that the elder Mr. Price had interfered with the raising of Laurence’s sons. The suit was thrown out of court in 1989.

Besides his sons Robert and Laurence, Mr. Price is survived by five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His wife, the former Helen Moskowitz, whom he married in 1938, died last year.

Mr. Price’s legacy is visible nationwide. In 2007, Investor’s Business Daily reported that membership wholesale clubs were a $70 billion industry in the United States, with more than 40 million members.

One of the chief beneficiaries of Mr. Price’s legacy, Sam Walton, acknowledged the debt in his 1992 memoir, “Made in America” (Doubleday, 1992; with John Huey). Mr. Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, wrote, “I guess I’ve stolen — I actually prefer the word ‘borrowed’ — as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business.”

612 2009-12-16 A day after Citigroup won approval to escape the government bailout program, a special tax break that the bank received to pave the way for its exit could become a point of contention in Washington.

After months of discussions, the Internal Revenue Service granted an exemption late Friday that allowed Citigroup to preserve a $38 billion tax benefit it stood to lose if it repaid the government. The decision essentially waived a longstanding rule that disqualified certain tax breaks if a significant ownership stake changed hands in an effort to discourage outside investors from buying tax benefits.

The Treasury Department’s plans to begin selling its one-third ownership in Citigroup, along with the bank’s planned $17 billion stock offering, would have been such an ownership change.

Without the waiver, the bank would have stood to lose much of those tax benefits as it recovered and it could have been significantly weakened, if not imperiled. Of the $38 billion of tax benefits, it has been allowed to count about $13 billion toward its regulatory capital requirements.

The ruling raises questions about whether federal officials moved too quickly to allow Citigroup to begin untangling itself from the government, given its fragile health. It also may lead to further scrutiny from lawmakers about whether the bank received favorable treatment.

A similar issue arose after Wells Fargo received an 11th-hour tax ruling that paved the way for its takeover of the Wachovia Corporation last year. At that time, officials from Citigroup, the losing bidder, complained that Wells received special treatment to do a deal.

Citigroup and federal officials had discussed the tax issues since late last summer as they worked through potential hurdles to the bank’s payback plans.
613 2009-12-16 “In a world of alternatives, that is the one we have,” he said. “This is what we can get done now.”

While the decision to put off the debt fight — as well as potential clashes over highway construction, antiterrorism laws and satellite television rights — takes Congress off the hook for now, it significantly complicates the Democratic calendar for 2010.

Democrats now will have to resolve all those policy disputes while preparing for a vote on President Obama’s request to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and, perhaps, still wrestling with health care. At the same time, the delay pushes some of the more politically delicate issues, like as an increase in the debt limit, that much closer to the November elections.

While the House was hoping to finish for the year and allow Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead a bipartisan delegation to the climate talks in Copenhagen, the situation in the Senate was in flux, with the health care debate likely to continue well into next week. And there was no assurance from Senate Republicans that they would make it easy for Democrats to finish quickly.

“I think we’ll wait until we see exactly how this is all going to be packaged before reacting to it,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.

The Pentagon spending bill, which typically has strong bipartisan support, is the last of a dozen annual money measures awaiting passage. Democrats had planned to attach to it a provision that would increase the current statutory debt limit of $12.1 trillion by another $1.8 trillion to avoid having to revisit the debt issue before the 2010 elections.

But Republicans, who have been assailing Democratic spending, balked at that approach, and the leadership also found itself negotiating with House and Senate Democrats who said they would not back the debt increase without some concessions.

Specifically, Senate Democrats led by Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee, wanted the debt increase tied to a vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts and revenue increases to reduce the debt. And House moderates sought more adherence to “pay as you go” rules.

Despite days of negotiations, Democrats were not able to reach an agreement and instead decided to seek approval of an increase in the debt sufficient to last into February while talks continued. As a result, Democrats face the prospect of two votes to increase the debt limit, a vote most lawmakers would rather avoid.

The debt limit was not the only issue left unfinished. The Pentagon measure is also expected to wrap in short-term extensions of other expiring federal programs and laws, including provisions of the antiterrorism USA Patriot Act, a highway construction law, small-business programs and a law governing satellite television transmission of local broadcast channels, among others.

Trying to ease fears of lawmakers worried that Congress has not done enough to create new jobs, the House was expected to pass a plan that would redirect $75 billion from the bank bailout fund to pay for infrastructure projects around the county as well as help states and cities retain and hire emergency personnel and teachers. The measure would also pay for another four months of safety-net programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps.

House Democrats, clearly frustrated at the pace of business in the Senate, said they hoped the measure would become law next year.

“We hope that when we pass it here, that it will, after the first of the year, be passed by the Senate, signed into law before the president comes to deliver his State of the Union address,” Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday.
614 2009-12-16 “There are 400 million people in India who lack access to electricity,” he said. “How do you switch off the light bulb that you don’t have?”

Some came dressed like pigs and dairy cows. Others carried giant papier-mâché fruits and vegetables on sticks.

Agriculture was the theme of the event, a noon protest that drew 300 to 400 people to Islands Brygge, a neighborhood on the south side of the inner canal here. Organized under the slogan “Resistance Is Ripe,” they contended that agricultural issues were being overlooked or mishandled by the government delegates gathered at the Bella Center.

Surrounded by dozens of police officers in vans, on horseback and on foot, the motley assemblage of cows, pigs, clowns, foods and a brown elephant on wheels — its exact meaning was never quite made clear — sallied through the streets as protesters gave speeches by loudspeaker, played reggae music and banged on drums.

Messages extolling the virtues of organic and small farms and the benefits to the climate of a vegan diet were abundant.

“Free the 21st-century slaves!” read a banner depicting a cow. “Reclaim the Fields!” said another.

Things ended peacefully in a driving wet snow outside the Danish Agricultural Association, where the crowd had dwindled to a few dozen.

In a restaurant in an 18th-century warehouse on the waterfront, power brokers from the nuclear industry made their case that the atom would play a big role in a cleaner-energy world.

The reception was a counterpoint to weekend exhortations by the anti-nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott, who urged marchers outside the Bella Center to reject nuclear power as a “wicked” technology spewing waste and plutonium.

Laurent Corbier, vice president for sustainable development for Areva, the French electricity provider, triumphantly noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change listed nuclear power as a suitable "mitigation technology” in its 2007 report.

But he warned that some countries were trying to exclude nuclear plants along with large dams from lists of projects that countries could get credit for as steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions under a proposed global treaty. “Nuclear must be part of the solution,” he declared.

Thomas M. Kerr, a senior energy analyst from the International Energy Agency in Paris, said that nuclear plants would have to play some role in meeting the energy needs of a growing human population while fossil-fuel emissions were reduced.

But nuclear plants alone will not meet the challenge, he said. So after snatching one more hors d’oeuvre, he headed for the door to hail a cab and go to a dinner with the solar industry.

One of the hardest rooms to get into in Copenhagen is the one where mayors from across the globe have gathered to boast about their green credentials.

They are part of a group called Local Governments for Sustainability, which has been holding standing-room-only presentations since the opening of the climate conference last week.

The organization has 1,100 delegates here, the largest number of any entity except Denmark, the host country.

Their numbers reflect the mushrooming effort by urban areas, where half the world’s population lives, to drive the conversation on tackling climate change and, perhaps more important, to secure financing for causes like mass transit.

Yet the mayors’ thunder was stolen to some degree on Tuesday by a governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.

Mr. Schwarzenegger made a pitch for the role of “subnational governments” like his, which is in the vanguard among American states on environmental issues.

But first he had to declare how “fantastic” it was to be in a foreign country where so many people speak with a non-American accent, just like him.

“I have been here for movie promotions and weight lifting and body building,” he mused. “I never thought I would get here as the governor of the great state of California and talking about climate change.”
615 2009-12-16 “It’s an honor to be among such a talented and diverse group,” one of the general managers, Mark Shapiro of the Cleveland Indians, said in a telephone interview. “Hopefully, we’ll have the ability to make a positive impact on the game at some point.”

EFFECT OF MATSUI’S DEPARTURE Hideki Matsui’s departure to the Los Angeles Angels may mean fewer Japanese reporters and Japanese fans at Yankee Stadium, and potentially fewer Japanese companies willing to spend money to advertise there.

That’s because to many Japanese fans of Major League Baseball, the player is more important than the team he plays on. This is particularly true of Matsui, perhaps the most celebrated ballplayer in Japan.

Not only was he a star for the Yomiuri Giants and the Yankees, but he was also the World Series most valuable player last month. The sight of thousands of Americans screaming Matsui’s name as he rode in the Yankees’ victory parade was a source of national pride in Japan.

The Japanese can take the perceptions of their players personally. Brian Cashman, the Yankees’ general manager, offended many in Japan when he said after the World Series that Matsui was “only” a designated hitter. That might have been an honest assessment of Matsui’s fielding skills, but in the eyes of some Japanese, it was also an insult to Matsui, said Robert Whiting, the author of “You Gotta Have Wa.”

Baseball fans in Japan will continue to follow Matsui no matter where he plays. The Angels’ games are likely to be shown on Japanese television more often, and Japanese travel agents will surely add stops in Anaheim on their group tours to Southern California.

It may also mean more income for Major League Baseball if Japanese fans discover a new team not in New York, Boston (which has Daisuke Matsuzaka) or Seattle (with Ichiro Suzuki).

“It’s really too bad, because fans of the Yankees have been increasing in Japan,” said Yuki Hattori, who runs Dentsu Sports America, a division of the Japanese advertising giant that controls the rights for M.L.B. games broadcast in Japan. “But it might be good for the M.L.B. because Japanese audiences will be exposed to a new team.” KEN BELSON RANGERS SALE Tom Hicks, the owner of the Texas Rangers, said that he had chosen to negotiate the sale of the club with an investment group that includes the sports lawyer Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan, the team’s president.

Hicks chose from among three contenders and now has 30 days to complete the transaction. The Hicks Sports Group will also need the approval of Major League Baseball and the group’s lenders.

The announcement was a significant step after a year of questions about the fate of the club. Hicks defaulted on $525 million in loans in March. The sale of the team could settle that debt. The Hicks family will retain a “significant investment” in the team, and Ryan will remain president.

In a statement, Hicks acknowledged that uncertainty about the club’s future weighed on fans.

“I know it’s been difficult, but this new generation of ownership is 100 percent resolved to excellence and a superior fan experience for the long term,” he said.

According to various reports, the club could sell for more than $500 million. KEN BELSON

WHITE SOX ACQUIRE PIERRE The Chicago White Sox got the leadoff man and left fielder they needed, and gave Juan Pierre got the chance to be an everyday player again. The White Sox acquired Pierre and $10.5 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers for two players to be named. Pierre, 32, hit .308 with 30 stolen bases, 57 runs and a .365 on-base percentage in 145 games last season. (AP)

MCCOURT HEARING SET FOR MAY An ownership dispute between the Dodgers’ owner, Frank McCourt, and his estranged wife will linger through at least a third of the 2010 season after a judge set a hearing for late May. McCourt, mired in a bitter divorce with his wife, Jamie, had wanted the ownership issue decided by spring training. The case has been cited as a distraction for the storied franchise at a time when the free-agent market is heating up. (AP)

CHAPMAN LAWSUIT The Cuban pitcher Aroldis Chapman’s original representative sued his current agent in Massachusetts state court, claiming that Hendricks Sports Management illegally lured him away from Athletes Premier International and the agent Edwin Mejia. The lawsuit accuses Hendricks of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, and claims that Athletes Premier “invested substantial time and hundreds of thousands of dollars” on Chapman’s behalf to help him defect, establish residency in Andorra and begin negotiating with major league teams. Randy Hendricks did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment. (AP)
616 2009-12-16 “The irony is, I don’t even go back to that music,” Mr. Newman said. “I’m almost too lazy. If there’s an artist I want to check out, I’d rather listen to it on Spotify than have to dig through my collection.”

The idea of a limitless jukebox in the sky — or in tech-speak, “in the cloud” — has been around for some time, but it is consuming music executives who now associate the word “funk” with more than just a musical genre. The recording industry, which had $40 billion in annual sales a decade ago, is now bringing in half that. More ominously, the growth of revenue from digital downloads, still only a fifth of the total sales pie, is slowing.

The deal for the little-known Lala was a small one from Apple’s perspective; the price was more than $80 million, according to a person briefed on the deal terms. But it is generating a lot of interest because of what it may say about Apple’s plans for streaming music.

With an estimated $2 billion in annual revenue from iTunes, Apple is in a good position to guide consumers through the process of storing their music collections on Web servers and listening to them in new ways. It can also tightly integrate such a music service into the iPhone, the iPod Touch and all other existing and future Apple gadgets that connect to the Internet.

Users would no longer have to synchronize their music collections between devices, would not have to worry about running out of storage space on their phone, and could more easily share playlists and recommendations with friends.

Apple could also ask users to pay a monthly subscription fee for access to a Spotify-like cloud-based catalog of music. Two music industry executives said Apple had been considering such a subscription service for years, but could never agree on the right revenue split with labels.

“We generally don’t comment on our purpose and plans,” said Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman.

David Pakman, a partner at the venture capital firm Venrock and the former chief executive of the download service eMusic, said that Apple “could accelerate the move to media in the cloud more quickly than any other company can.” The acquisition of Lala, he said, “tells us they’re doing it.”

Other recent developments in the music and technology businesses also suggest an impending shift in a century-long approach to music, in which people considered it to be something they owned, either in physical formats or digitally on their computers.

In August, Spotify introduced its iPhone application, which stores temporary copies of songs and playlists on the phone so that music keeps playing even when the device drops off the network. Spotify’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, said subscriber numbers had jumped significantly since the introduction of the app; he would not give exact figures.

The iPhone application “was a huge step toward a paradigm shift where it’s no longer about à la carte purchases, but access to music,” Mr. Ek said.

Spotify, based in London, hopes to introduce its service in the United States at the beginning of next year, although people briefed on its discussions with music companies say that the labels were resisting a component of the service in which music would be available free, supported by ads.

Pandora, the free Internet radio service, offers an application that continues to be among the most popular apps for the iPhone, and the company says that 30 percent of its listeners connect over cellphones.

Meanwhile, MySpace, owned by the News Corporation, has acquired two cloud music services in the last month, iLike and Imeem. People briefed on discussions inside MySpace say it is developing a subscription music service to complement its free, ad-supported MySpace Music, a joint venture with the four major music labels.

Courtney Holt, president of MySpace Music, would not discuss specific plans. But he said consumers care less about how music is delivered and more about finding new ways to share and discover music with their friends.

Technology start-ups have hoped for years that the vast selection and convenience of Web-based music offerings would lure people into spending a few dollars a month in subscription fees. That business, for companies like Rhapsody, jointly owned by RealNetworks and MTV, and Napster, a division of Best Buy, has not yet shown real promise.

But with the added appeal that such services can now be accessed on smartphones, many entrepreneurs are reconsidering that model. “There’s nothing sexy about an MP3 on your computer,” said David Hyman, chief executive of Mog, which introduced a subscription service this month called Mog All Access. “I don’t think consumers care where the music is stored, as long as they can get it when they want it.”

Not everyone agrees that music in the cloud will constitute a silver lining for the music industry. Critics say wireless connectivity, particularly on overtaxed networks like AT&T’s in the United States, is still too unreliable to provide a constant stream of music on mobile devices. They also worry that wireless companies will increase charges for data as the streaming of music and video becomes more popular.

It seems likely that the idea of music ownership will never go away, and that newer methods of accessing music will exist alongside old ones. Bobby Mohr, a 23-year-old music fan from Brooklyn who has accumulated 100 gigabytes of songs, keeps some of them on free Web-based storage services, so he can download tracks when he travels and burn them onto CDs to play in the car.

But Mr. Mohr is hesitant to abandon the idea of owning music altogether, citing the unreliability of wireless networks and the fact that his collection would be inaccessible at his job at a police oversight agency, where he is not allowed to use the Internet.

“I like having external hard drives that are troves of my music,” he said. “You just collect it, you have this library. You discover new genres every year and you go through it and look at what you have, and that’s nice.”

Bob Lefsetz, who writes an influential music industry newsletter, the Lefsetz Letter, acknowledged that some people bristle at the idea of not owning their music, but he compared them to people who once said they would never rent a videotape.

“If you ask anybody today, they’ll tell you, ‘I need to own it.’ But once you have these services, you get to the point of, ‘Why would I own it, because I have access to everything?’ ”
617 2009-12-16 The Authors Guild, a trade group that represents writers, posted a statement on its Web site (authorsguild.org) on Tuesday disputing efforts by Random House to claim e-book rights to titles published before 1994. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that “the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats.” But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. “Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random House’s standard contracts prior to 1994,” the guild wrote. The statement continued: “Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.” Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company “respectfully disagrees” with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were “ours to maximize.”
618 2009-12-16 Abba, Genesis, Jimmy Cliff, the Hollies and the Stooges will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year, the Hall of Fame Foundation has announced. But the biggest news might be who did not make the cut. Kiss, nominated for the first time this year after being snubbed for a decade, was left out, although if the Stooges’ experience is any guide Kiss (Gene Simmons, the group’s mainstay, right) may have better luck next time: the Stooges were nominated and rejected seven times before being accepted. Also being honored this year, as nonperformers, are David Geffen and seven songwriters: Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, Jesse Stone, Mort Shuman and Otis Blackwell. The 25th annual induction ceremony is to be held on March 15 at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan.
619 2009-12-16 Or that everlasting bonds would form, attaching former Life ruggers to the university and to one another with a devotion rarely seen in sports?

“Our most active group of alumni is definitely the ex-rugby players,” Riekeman said. “They are ambassadors, tight knit, good fund-raisers.”

They coach rugby in high schools. From the sideline or while hunched over aching patients in their offices, they direct young men, and women, to Life, especially those with an interest in rugby.

They bought the team bus, valued at $65,000, and paid for the athletes’ weight room. When budget limitations would have kept 13 nonessential players home from a championship event in May, the alumni financed their trip to Colorado.

“You get bitten by the rugby bug, you fall in love with it and you get close to the players” past and present, said David Eugster, class of 1983, the alumni association’s president.

The chiropractic college, by far the largest of three schools at Life, lost its accreditation in 2001 in a dispute over teaching philosophy, jeopardizing the university’s existence. Enrollment plummeted to 500, from 3,500, forcing cuts in spending. Rugby was “very, very close” to expiring, Eugster said.

The old guard stepped forward, checkbooks in hand, and helped rugby stay afloat until the college was restored to good academic graces.

Eugster said, “Everybody who knows rugby in this country — and there are a lot of them — knows of Life rugby and their premier team.”

The superior of the two Life squads, consisting largely of graduate students, belongs to the 16-member, invitation-only Super League. It’s the top shelf of American rugby, and Life, which has won one championship in the Super League since its inception in 1996, was runner-up last spring.

Both versions of Life’s Running Eagles compete on the more competitive club level, not against teams at universities. The arrangement allows for some upper-crust ruggers who have completed their studies to continue to play for the team.

Brendan Thompson is among the fortunate few on full scholarship. A native of Perth, Australia, he was painting houses in Chicago and engaging in scrums on weekends when he heard about Life.

“I didn’t know much about chiropractic,” Thompson said. “Had never seen one before.” Now he intends to be a chiropractor.

His teammate Kris Headley seems less certain of his career path. Discovered in Montana by a former Life rugby player, Headley, a construction worker and player for the Missoula All-Maggots (slogan: “A Maggot Squirms Through It”), concedes to “not knowing much” about the profession. He is just happy to be a Running Eagle. “It’s like a brotherhood,” he said.

Life’s locker room contains a medley of accents — South African and French, Kiwi and Kenyan — which illustrates the program’s reach. Men’s basketball at Life was once a heavyweight in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and begins this season as a contender. But Riekeman said that the awareness the university gains from rugby was “astronomically more than the basketball team.”

Attention is sure to heighten now that rugby — the seven-on-seven version, not the standard 15 players per side — has been welcomed to the Olympics, starting in 2016. Also, a third team from Life will compete next season, this one at the college level.

Rugby generates no direct income here. Spectators who alight on the five rows of metal bleachers are admitted free. The stadium — with crooked goal posts, a postage-stamp-size scoreboard and clock, and a tent as the visitors’ dressing room — would have to upgrade to qualify as no-frills.

In years past, tables were lined up along the field, with chiropractors giving alignments free to fans and opposing players. Insurance concerns ended the perk.

Gary Lambert, class of 1988, a onetime United States national team captain, wound up at Life after he claimed an adjustment “literally saved my life” and altered his career ambition.

Suffering from a neck injury, numbness and headaches in the early 1980s, Lambert was weighing surgery when his national team roommate mentioned he was a chiropractor.

Lambert had no idea what a chiropractor did, then became such a believer that he soon found himself in a registration line at Life.

Someone recognized Lambert, who was wearing a rugby shirt. He was pulled out of the line and by day’s end was a Running Eagle on scholarship. A generation later, his son followed.

Their fellow alumnus Eugster attributes the fraternal nature of ruggers partly to “the physicality,” a polite way of saying how rough it is. A seven-year study of an Australian professional squad concluded that a match causes an average of 1.4 serious injuries, twice the rate of football. The national insurance provider of New Zealand, where rugby is the national sport, ranks rugby playing as its most dangerous occupation, ahead of horse racing and logging.

Hence the players’ affinity for strong hands navigating their spines, which, advocates say, promotes health as well as relieves pain. Between pregame player adjustments, David Ward, the sports performance director at Life, said, “Rugby seems to be a match with chiropractic.”

The Running Eagles went out and won, 28-16. Like most of their matches, it was no spine-tingler.
620 2009-12-16 An official settlement, which will allow Credit Suisse to avoid prosecution, is expected to be announced on Wednesday, but late Tuesday, the bank issued a statement confirming the fine.

In October, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, announced that his office, the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve were working on a case against a large international “mainstream bank” for allowing illicit financial transactions with Iran, which has long been subject to sanctions by the United States government.

In the weeks that followed, Credit Suisse officials negotiated the amount of the fine with federal and state authorities.

Mr. Morgenthau declined to comment Tuesday. His office is expected to split the settlement amount evenly with the federal authorities. Under a new state law, Mr. Morgenthau’s office would then disburse his office’s share — $268 million — equally between New York City and the state. The $268 million would be the largest financial settlement that the Manhattan district attorney’s office has ever secured.

The fine imposed on Credit Suisse comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and Iran. The Obama administration recently signaled its intention to push for a new set of sanctions that could further restrict Tehran’s economic and commercial activities unless Iran agrees to bring its nuclear activities under stricter international supervision.

Federal and state authorities reached a similar settlement in January with Lloyds TSB, a London-based bank now under British government control. In that case, Lloyds agreed to pay $350 million to settle accusations that it had removed identifying information from transactions originating in Iran, Libya and Sudan.

But in the Lloyds case, the authorities were not able to identify specific Iranian organizations that were carrying out the transactions or what was being purchased.

The authorities identified more than 7,000 illicit transactions that Credit Suisse facilitated, worth about $700 million, a law enforcement official said. Investigators found an additional $1.1 billion in transactions that had been manipulated, but they have not deemed them as violating sanctions in this case, the official said.

Investigators found that Credit Suisse’s employees violated both state and federal laws by falsifying outgoing dollar payment messages that involved Iran. The bank’s employees removed reference to Iran or its banks, a practice called stripping.

Not only did Credit Suisse employees strip the wire transfers, but they also advised the Iranian banks on how to format their transfers to avoid detection, according to the official. As a result, investigators say, Iranian banks like Bank Saderat and Bank Melli were able to use Credit Suisse to send more than a billion dollars through New York banks.

The Atomic Energy Organization is said to have ties with Iran’s nuclear weapons program, while Aerospace Industries works with long-range missiles, the authorities said. Law enforcement officials said they thought the organizations had been buying materials for their programs. The sellers, most of whom were outside the United States, wanted dollars, and so the money passed through Manhattan banks, law enforcement officials said.

But in some cases, a law enforcement official said, the money was used for purchases from United States companies. But the Iranian organizations concealed their identities from the American sellers by setting up shell companies, law enforcement officials said.

Credit Suisse also facilitated smaller transactions for banks in other sanctioned countries, including Cuba, Sudan, Burma and Libya, the official said.

It has not been a good year for Swiss banks in the United States. In February, UBS was fined $780 million by the Justice Department for helping about 50,000 wealthy Americans evade taxes.

UBS admitted criminal wrongdoing in selling offshore banking services that the I.R.S. said it suspected had been used by Americans to avoid taxes. Six months later, in August, UBS turned over the names of about 4,450 of those clients. That move contributed to the decision by 14,700 Americans to join an I.R.S. amnesty program and disclose their previously secret foreign bank accounts.

In the fall, UBS received a $5.3 billion capital injection from the Swiss government in return for a 9 percent stake. It was allowed to dispose of up to $60 billion of illiquid securities and impaired assets. The Swiss government offered Credit Suisse a similar deal, but the bank opted to raise money from private investors.
621 2009-12-16 EVERETT, Wash. — The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted into the gray skies here for the first time on Tuesday morning, more than two years behind schedule and burdened with restoring Boeing’s pre-eminence in global commercial aviation.

“Engines, engines, engines, engines!” shouted April Seixeiro, 37, when the glossy twin-engine plane began warming up across from where spectators had informally gathered at Paine Field. Ms. Seixeiro was among scores of local residents and self-described “aviation geeks” who came to watch the first flight.

Moments after the plane took off at 10:27 a.m., Mrs. Seixeiro was wiping tears from her eyes. A friend, Katie Bailey, 34, cried, too.

“That was so beautiful,” Ms. Bailey said.

Even as aviation fans celebrated in this Seattle suburb, where generations of families have built planes for Boeing, the 787’s long route to takeoff was challenged yet again: the test flight was cut short because of what Boeing said was rough weather. Rather than cross the Cascade Mountains, as was intended, the plane instead spent much of its time over Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca before touching down in light rain about two hours early, at about 1:30 p.m., at its intended destination, Boeing Field in Seattle.

Randall Neville, one of the test pilots, said afterward that weather, including poor visibility, was the only reason for the change in plans. “The thing that caught me most today was that this airplane flew like we expected it to,” Mr. Neville said. “There were no surprises.”
622 2009-12-16 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge dismissed fraud and conspiracy charges Tuesday in the stock-option backdating case against two Broadcom Corporation executives, because of prosecutorial misconduct.

Judge Cormac J. Carney of United States District Court also asked prosecutors to explain why a separate drug indictment against one of the executives, Henry T. Nicholas III, should not also be thrown out, and he dismissed a civil case the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed against four Broadcom executives. The other executive was the former chief financial officer, William J. Ruehle.

The move came after Judge Carney vacated a guilty plea by Broadcom’s co-founder, Henry Samueli, in the same case last week after hearing him testify for two days as a defense witness for Mr. Ruehle under a grant of immunity.

Judge Carney found that prosecutors had tried to prevent three crucial defense witnesses from testifying, improperly contacted attorneys for defense witnesses and leaked information about grand jury proceedings to the media.

“I find that the government has intimidated and improperly influenced the three witnesses critical to Mr. Ruehle’s defense and the cumulative effect of that misconduct has distorted the truth-finding process and impeded the integrity of the trial,” Judge Carney said.
623 2009-12-16 From steel making to mining, American industries posted higher-than-expected gains in production in November, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, offering some hope that manufacturers would soon begin to accelerate their output.

But many factories were still operating below capacity, economists noted, and the gains could disappear if spending by American consumers remained weak.

“Positive momentum is building, but at this point a broad-based economic recovery has yet to materialize for American industries,” said Dave Huether, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. “The recovery is still fragile and in the beginning stages.”

Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to weigh the data on production, as well as a separate report released Tuesday showing an increase in wholesale prices, when they meet to set interest rates on Wednesday. But despite an increase in production and prices, many economists say they believe that inflationary pressures remain in check and that the Fed will leave rates unchanged.

Over all, industrial production rose 0.8 percent in November — the largest increase since August — outpacing expectations. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of the nation’s production capability is in use, remained at 71.3 percent, far below the historical average of 80.9.

Fed officials have said in recent weeks that the large amount of excess capacity in the economy will keep inflation under control.
624 2009-12-16 Todd Stern, the chief climate negotiator for the United States, also warned that was “a great deal left to do.”

“The parties are still far apart on a fair number of issues,” he said.

As world leaders began making their way to Copenhagen for an uncertain conclusion to the two-week talks, protesters and police also clashed on the streets. For the first time since the two-week conference began, law enforcement officers used tear gas to disperse crowds of rioters, who were reportedly lobbing small firebombs, a police spokesman said Tuesday.

Nearly 200 more arrests were made Monday night as the protesters, angered by the lack of progress in negotiations, set fire to makeshift barricades in Copenhagen’s Christiania neighborhood.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain was expected to arrive Tuesday afternoon, two days ahead of schedule, in an effort to move the talks forward. The Danish presidency of the conference asked nations to pair up — one from a developing country, and one from an industrialized nation— and seek jointly to push other countries to make progress on some of the most difficult issues that still must be resolved.

Ed Miliband, Britain’s secretary of state for climate change, for example, will team up with the Ghanaian environment minister, Hani Sherry Ayittey, to lead group talks aimed at ensuring that enough money is put on the table for poor countries. Poorer nations say they need a robust long-term financing commitment from developed nations to cope with climate changes they did not cause, like rising seas.

Mr. Miliband and Ms. Ayittey “will be undertaking intensive consultations aimed at breaking through the deadlock on one of the toughest issues on the table in Copenhagen,” the British government said.

At his midday news conference, Mr. De Boer said, “What makes this process complicated is that you have small island nations who are about to disappear because of sea level rise, you have oil producers who are legitimately concerned about the future of their economy, you have major industrialized nations who are afraid they will lose jobs and you have major developing countries whose overriding concern is economic growth and poverty eradication.”

Speaking at the conference, Al Gore, the former vice president and climate campaigner, called on President Obama and the United States Senate to set a deadline of April 22 — the 40th anniversary of the first Earth Day — for passage of a climate change bill to improve the chances of a binding global treaty next year.

When contacted, a senior administration official refused to be pinned down to a date but said, “We’ll do everything in our power to move it as quickly as possible.”

Mr. Gore also called for a climate summit meeting next July in Mexico City — six months before a meeting already planned there — to advance efforts toward a treaty on climate change, Bloomberg News reported.

On Tuesday morning, lines of government delegates and representatives of environmental organizations seeking access to the conference already stretched several hundred yards outside the venue’s main entrance.

The United Nations, which is sponsoring the talks, said in an e-mail statement on Tuesday that more than 45,000 people had applied to attend the conference — three times the capacity of the building

“An overwhelming number of those who applied arrived on Monday, causing congestion in the area outside the U.N. venue, which is under the control of the Danish police,” the statement said.

626 2009-12-16 The authority argues that state and city lawmakers are squarely to blame for the potential demise of the student discounts. For nearly half a century, schoolchildren’s fares were fully subsidized by Albany and City Hall, until Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yanked all the city’s funding in 1994.

The result was a standoff between the transit agency and City Hall marked by the same type of blustery language that emerged on Tuesday. Although he raged about the cruelty of eliminating student discounts, Mr. Giuliani eventually gave in, and a last-minute deal was struck to divide the program’s funding equally among the authority, the city and the state, with each paying $45 million a year.

But even as the program has become more expensive, the city kept its contribution the same. The state, meanwhile, slashed its annual subsidy to $6 million from $25 million in November as part of a broader cost-saving plan.

“It is a game of leverage where the students basically are pawns,” said George Arzt, a political consultant and a longtime observer of the municipal arena. Recalling the Giuliani dispute, he said that the issue of student fares could be a potent political tool. “When you think of so many kids affected, and two voting parents in many cases, that is a powerful, powerful electoral bloc.”

Mr. Arzt’s point appeared to be underscored by the anger directed at the authority on Tuesday. “We aren’t going to stand for it,” declared Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, weighing in from Copenhagen. (The mayor has directed his appointees on the authority’s board to vote against the proposal, which must be approved again separately next year.)

Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, denounced the authority’s decision-making as “undemocratic.” And dozens of elected officials gathered in rallies throughout the city to accuse the authority of punishing poorer parents and pushing students toward truancy, turnstile-hopping or worse.

A spokesman for the mayor said that Albany lawmakers had an obligation to restore its subsidy. “We have kept our funding in place, and are going to continue to do so. The state should do the same,” said Marc LaVorgna, the spokesman.

Mr. Paterson, at a press conference, pledged to restore funding to the program if the state received additional revenue next year.

Members of the authority’s board appeared to be divided. On Monday, Norman Seabrook, the labor leader, said the cuts would be nightmarish: “Kids shouldn’t have to jump a turnstile to get to school!”

But Doreen M. Frasca, an appointee of Governor Paterson, said she hoped the plan would put pressure on the city and state to restore some funding.

“If these discussions prompt the city and the state to do the right thing by contributing their fair share, then it’s a discussion worth having,” Ms. Frasca said. “I don’t plan to back down on student fares, I really don’t. As much as I regret it, I hope we can stand our ground on it.”
627 2009-12-16 Rams guard Richie Incognito, who was voted the game's dirtiest player in a Sporting News poll last month, returned to the St. Louis lineup Sunday after missing four games with a foot injury. His return lasted a quarter and a half....
628 2009-12-16 “In a world of alternatives, that is the one we have,” he said. “This is what we can get done now.”

While the decision to put off the debt fight — as well as potential clashes over highway construction, antiterrorism laws and satellite television rights — takes Congress off the hook for now, it significantly complicates the Democratic calendar for 2010.

Democrats now will have to resolve all those policy disputes while preparing for a vote on President Obama’s request to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and, perhaps, still wrestling with health care. At the same time, the delay pushes some of the more politically delicate issues, like as an increase in the debt limit, that much closer to the November elections.

While the House was hoping to finish for the year and allow Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead a bipartisan delegation to the climate talks in Copenhagen, the situation in the Senate was in flux, with the health care debate likely to continue well into next week. And there was no assurance from Senate Republicans that they would make it easy for Democrats to finish quickly.

“I think we’ll wait until we see exactly how this is all going to be packaged before reacting to it,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.

The Pentagon spending bill, which typically has strong bipartisan support, is the last of a dozen annual money measures awaiting passage. Democrats had planned to attach to it a provision that would increase the current statutory debt limit of $12.1 trillion by another $1.8 trillion to avoid having to revisit the debt issue before the 2010 elections.

But Republicans, who have been assailing Democratic spending, balked at that approach, and the leadership also found itself negotiating with House and Senate Democrats who said they would not back the debt increase without some concessions.

Specifically, Senate Democrats led by Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee, wanted the debt increase tied to a vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts and revenue increases to reduce the debt. And House moderates sought more adherence to “pay as you go” rules.

Despite days of negotiations, Democrats were not able to reach an agreement and instead decided to seek approval of an increase in the debt sufficient to last into February while talks continued. As a result, Democrats face the prospect of two votes to increase the debt limit, a vote most lawmakers would rather avoid.

The debt limit was not the only issue left unfinished. The Pentagon measure is also expected to wrap in short-term extensions of other expiring federal programs and laws, including provisions of the antiterrorism USA Patriot Act, a highway construction law, small-business programs and a law governing satellite television transmission of local broadcast channels, among others.

Trying to ease fears of lawmakers worried that Congress has not done enough to create new jobs, the House was expected to pass a plan that would redirect $75 billion from the bank bailout fund to pay for infrastructure projects around the county as well as help states and cities retain and hire emergency personnel and teachers. The measure would also pay for another four months of safety-net programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps.

House Democrats, clearly frustrated at the pace of business in the Senate, said they hoped the measure would become law next year.

“We hope that when we pass it here, that it will, after the first of the year, be passed by the Senate, signed into law before the president comes to deliver his State of the Union address,” Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday.
629 2009-12-16 “We think the secret of good mass merchandising is the intelligent loss of sales,” Mr. Price told The New York Times in 1986. “It means you have to decide what sales you are prepared to live without. Can you live without credit cards that cost you two points? Can you live without advertising? Can you live without $35-to-$40-a-foot occupancy costs for a prime location?”

Mr. Price made it up in volume. By 1993, shortly before merging with Costco, Price Club comprised 94 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with annual revenue of more than $6 billion. Mr. Price, who was long active in philanthropic affairs, had an estimated net worth of $500 million, The San Diego Business Journal reported in 2006.

Sol Price was born in the Bronx on Jan 23, 1916. His parents worked in New York City’s garment industry. (The original family surname has been lost to time. It was changed, prophetically, to Price at Ellis Island.) After moving with his family to San Diego as a youth, he did undergraduate study at several colleges before earning a law degree from the University of Southern California in the late 1930s.

Mr. Price worked as a business lawyer in San Diego before starting FedMart, a local discount warehouse, with several partners in 1954. Membership in FedMart, which eventually sold liquor, pharmacy items, household goods and premium gasoline, cost $2 and was limited to government employees and their families. (At first, the $2 fee bought membership for life, but the term was later changed to a year.) The FedMart chain grew to include more than 40 stores throughout the Southwest.

In the mid-1970s FedMart was sold to a German retailer, and before long, at the age of 59, Mr. Price found himself out of a job. He and his son founded Price Club, which was originally aimed at small-business owners. For an annual membership fee of $25, for instance, an accountant could buy inexpensive office stationery, or a saloonkeeper could buy cigarettes and toilet paper.

In its first year, Mr. Price’s business lost $750,000. Only after membership was extended to the general consumer did it began to thrive, and before long Price Club had become an integral part of the American retail experience.

Vast, concrete-floored and teeming with shopping carts, Price Clubs exuded a certain spartan cachet. Industrial shelves were stocked with a variety of products, including cigarettes, auto parts, alcohol, clothing, Robert Ludlum paperbacks, Rolex Oyster watches, 10-pound bags of rice and gallon jars of mayonnaise.

For a time, many Price Club warehouses had attached tire installation centers, an operation owned by Mr. Price’s son Laurence. But in a widely reported feud with his father, Laurence Price filed for arbitration after Sol Price canceled the leases on those centers in 1985; Laurence was awarded $3.7 million.

In 1987 Laurence Price sued his father for emotional distress, contending that the elder Mr. Price had interfered with the raising of Laurence’s sons. The suit was thrown out of court in 1989.

Besides his sons Robert and Laurence, Mr. Price is survived by five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His wife, the former Helen Moskowitz, whom he married in 1938, died last year.

Mr. Price’s legacy is visible nationwide. In 2007, Investor’s Business Daily reported that membership wholesale clubs were a $70 billion industry in the United States, with more than 40 million members.

One of the chief beneficiaries of Mr. Price’s legacy, Sam Walton, acknowledged the debt in his 1992 memoir, “Made in America” (Doubleday, 1992; with John Huey). Mr. Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, wrote, “I guess I’ve stolen — I actually prefer the word ‘borrowed’ — as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business.”
630 2009-12-16 EVERETT, Wash. — The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted into the gray skies here for the first time on Tuesday morning, more than two years behind schedule and burdened with restoring Boeing’s pre-eminence in global commercial aviation.

“Engines, engines, engines, engines!” shouted April Seixeiro, 37, when the glossy twin-engine plane began warming up across from where spectators had informally gathered at Paine Field. Ms. Seixeiro was among scores of local residents and self-described “aviation geeks” who came to watch the first flight.

Moments after the plane took off at 10:27 a.m., Mrs. Seixeiro was wiping tears from her eyes. A friend, Katie Bailey, 34, cried, too.

“That was so beautiful,” Ms. Bailey said.

Even as aviation fans celebrated in this Seattle suburb, where generations of families have built planes for Boeing, the 787’s long route to takeoff was challenged yet again: the test flight was cut short because of what Boeing said was rough weather. Rather than cross the Cascade Mountains, as was intended, the plane instead spent much of its time over Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca before touching down in light rain about two hours early, at about 1:30 p.m., at its intended destination, Boeing Field in Seattle.

Randall Neville, one of the test pilots, said afterward that weather, including poor visibility, was the only reason for the change in plans. “The thing that caught me most today was that this airplane flew like we expected it to,” Mr. Neville said. “There were no surprises.”
631 2009-12-16 The document describes a plan for measuring the output of a device called a neutron initiator, which has no use other than triggering a nuclear explosion. Intelligence agencies are treating it as if the very paper it was written on was itself radioactive.

Once burned when it accepted evidence about Iraq’s search for uranium that turned out to be a forgery, the C.I.A. has not declared whether it believes the document is real, according to intelligence officials from several countries. European spy agencies are similarly cautious.

“Some people think this is the smoking gun,” one senior European official said Tuesday, “and others say it will be very hard to prove if it’s authentic.”

Inside intelligence agencies, the document has attracted much attention because its subject matter is familiar to anyone who has delved into Iran’s atomic experiments: It describes a testing regime that would help Iran master the science of the initiator, a device to generate bursts of subatomic particles known as neutrons, which initiate and speed the chain reactions that lead to the detonation of a warhead.

When the document appeared in a public report on Sunday, it forced American officials to begin to talk about it. But they insisted that even if it turned out to be genuine, it would only reinforce their strong belief that Iran had worked on a weapon.

“This information’s been sloshing around for well over a year,” said one American official, who insisted on anonymity because he was discussing sensitive intelligence information. “It’s not new to the intelligence people. They’ve taken account of it. If, in fact, the document’s on the level, it shows the Iranians at some point were interested in testing an initiator. That’s not a warhead or the core of a bomb. It’s another reminder — as if one were needed — that the Iranians have a lot of explaining to do when it comes to things nuclear.”

Concern that Iran could be working on neutron initiators goes back at least six years. As early as 2003, the inspection agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, found evidence in Iran that raised suspicions.

In the current case, the most sensational claim is that the undated document was drafted in 2007. Because American intelligence agencies have judged that Iran suspended its effort to build a nuclear warhead in 2003 — a conclusion that neither the Europeans nor the Israelis agree with — the 2007 date, if true, would mean that the American assessment is wrong. And since the document describes a four-year research plan, the arms work, at least in theory, could be hitting its stride right now.

Not only intelligence agencies but also private nuclear experts see high risks in ringing alarm bells just yet.

The Institute for Science and International Security, a group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said in a report Monday that it “urges caution and further assessment” of the document, in particular to confirm its date. “The document does not mention nuclear weapons,” the report noted, “and we have seen no evidence of an Iranian decision to build them.”

The Times of London claimed that the document showed that Iran “is working on testing a key final component of a nuclear bomb.” It made public the document in its original Persian as well as an English translation, starting a groundswell of global news coverage and expert reaction.

“It’s very troubling — if real,” said Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist in the nuclear program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in Washington that tracks atomic arsenals.

Richard M. Barlow, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a former C.I.A. analyst, said he found the document seemingly genuine. “If it’s a forgery,” he said, “it’s very good.”

Claims and evidence of Iranian interest in neutron initiators go back two decades, to the earliest days of Iran’s suspected work on nuclear arms. In Vienna, international inspectors have filed many reports about how Iran began experiments in the late 1980s on generating neutrons with polonium-210 — a form of the metallic element that is highly radioactive.

The Iranians did the polonium experiments on the Tehran Research Reactor, the device at the center of the current political standoff over whether Iran will export most of its enriched uranium in exchange for fresh reactor fuel. The reactor can produce medical isotopes. Over the years, Iran has been less forthcoming about its potential military uses.

In multiple reports, beginning in 2004, the inspection agency warned that Iran’s polonium research on the Tehran reactor had potential relevance for making “a neutron initiator in some designs of nuclear weapons.”

So too, in February 2005, an Iranian opposition group known as the National Council of Resistance of Iran said it had obtained evidence that Iran’s polonium research was getting close to the point of producing a device that could “trigger a chain reaction for a nuclear bomb.”

This week, nuclear experts said the research outlined in the newly disclosed document implied that Iranian work on nuclear initiators might have advanced past the polonium model.
632 2009-12-16 Todd Stern, the chief climate negotiator for the United States, also warned that was “a great deal left to do.”

“The parties are still far apart on a fair number of issues,” he said.

“An overwhelming number of those who applied arrived on Monday, causing congestion in the area outside the U.N. venue, which is under the control of the Danish police,” the statement said.
633 2009-12-16 An official settlement, which will allow Credit Suisse to avoid prosecution, is expected to be announced on Wednesday, but late Tuesday, the bank issued a statement confirming the fine.

In October, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, announced that his office, the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve were working on a case against a large international “mainstream bank” for allowing illicit financial transactions with Iran, which has long been subject to sanctions by the United States government.

In the weeks that followed, Credit Suisse officials negotiated the amount of the fine with federal and state authorities.

Mr. Morgenthau declined to comment Tuesday. His office is expected to split the settlement amount evenly with the federal authorities. Under a new state law, Mr. Morgenthau’s office would then disburse his office’s share — $268 million — equally between New York City and the state. The $268 million would be the largest financial settlement that the Manhattan district attorney’s office has ever secured.

The fine imposed on Credit Suisse comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and Iran. The Obama administration recently signaled its intention to push for a new set of sanctions that could further restrict Tehran’s economic and commercial activities unless Iran agrees to bring its nuclear activities under stricter international supervision.

Federal and state authorities reached a similar settlement in January with Lloyds TSB, a London-based bank now under British government control. In that case, Lloyds agreed to pay $350 million to settle accusations that it had removed identifying information from transactions originating in Iran, Libya and Sudan.

But in the Lloyds case, the authorities were not able to identify specific Iranian organizations that were carrying out the transactions or what was being purchased.

The authorities identified more than 7,000 illicit transactions that Credit Suisse facilitated, worth about $700 million, a law enforcement official said. Investigators found an additional $1.1 billion in transactions that had been manipulated, but they have not deemed them as violating sanctions in this case, the official said.

Investigators found that Credit Suisse’s employees violated both state and federal laws by falsifying outgoing dollar payment messages that involved Iran. The bank’s employees removed reference to Iran or its banks, a practice called stripping.

Not only did Credit Suisse employees strip the wire transfers, but they also advised the Iranian banks on how to format their transfers to avoid detection, according to the official. As a result, investigators say, Iranian banks like Bank Saderat and Bank Melli were able to use Credit Suisse to send more than a billion dollars through New York banks.

The Atomic Energy Organization is said to have ties with Iran’s nuclear weapons program, while Aerospace Industries works with long-range missiles, the authorities said. Law enforcement officials said they thought the organizations had been buying materials for their programs. The sellers, most of whom were outside the United States, wanted dollars, and so the money passed through Manhattan banks, law enforcement officials said.

But in some cases, a law enforcement official said, the money was used for purchases from United States companies. But the Iranian organizations concealed their identities from the American sellers by setting up shell companies, law enforcement officials said.

Credit Suisse also facilitated smaller transactions for banks in other sanctioned countries, including Cuba, Sudan, Burma and Libya, the official said.

It has not been a good year for Swiss banks in the United States. In February, UBS was fined $780 million by the Justice Department for helping about 50,000 wealthy Americans evade taxes.

UBS admitted criminal wrongdoing in selling offshore banking services that the I.R.S. said it suspected had been used by Americans to avoid taxes. Six months later, in August, UBS turned over the names of about 4,450 of those clients. That move contributed to the decision by 14,700 Americans to join an I.R.S. amnesty program and disclose their previously secret foreign bank accounts.

In the fall, UBS received a $5.3 billion capital injection from the Swiss government in return for a 9 percent stake. It was allowed to dispose of up to $60 billion of illiquid securities and impaired assets. The Swiss government offered Credit Suisse a similar deal, but the bank opted to raise money from private investors.
634 2009-12-16 From steel making to mining, American industries posted higher-than-expected gains in production in November, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, offering some hope that manufacturers would soon begin to accelerate their output.

But many factories were still operating below capacity, economists noted, and the gains could disappear if spending by American consumers remained weak.

“Positive momentum is building, but at this point a broad-based economic recovery has yet to materialize for American industries,” said Dave Huether, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. “The recovery is still fragile and in the beginning stages.”

Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to weigh the data on production, as well as a separate report released Tuesday showing an increase in wholesale prices, when they meet to set interest rates on Wednesday. But despite an increase in production and prices, many economists say they believe that inflationary pressures remain in check and that the Fed will leave rates unchanged.

Over all, industrial production rose 0.8 percent in November — the largest increase since August — outpacing expectations. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of the nation’s production capability is in use, remained at 71.3 percent, far below the historical average of 80.9.

Fed officials have said in recent weeks that the large amount of excess capacity in the economy will keep inflation under control.

636 2009-12-16 “There are 400 million people in India who lack access to electricity,” he said. “How do you switch off the light bulb that you don’t have?”

Some came dressed like pigs and dairy cows. Others carried giant papier-mâché fruits and vegetables on sticks.

Agriculture was the theme of the event, a noon protest that drew 300 to 400 people to Islands Brygge, a neighborhood on the south side of the inner canal here. Organized under the slogan “Resistance Is Ripe,” they contended that agricultural issues were being overlooked or mishandled by the government delegates gathered at the Bella Center.

Surrounded by dozens of police officers in vans, on horseback and on foot, the motley assemblage of cows, pigs, clowns, foods and a brown elephant on wheels — its exact meaning was never quite made clear — sallied through the streets as protesters gave speeches by loudspeaker, played reggae music and banged on drums.

Messages extolling the virtues of organic and small farms and the benefits to the climate of a vegan diet were abundant.

“Free the 21st-century slaves!” read a banner depicting a cow. “Reclaim the Fields!” said another.

Things ended peacefully in a driving wet snow outside the Danish Agricultural Association, where the crowd had dwindled to a few dozen.

In a restaurant in an 18th-century warehouse on the waterfront, power brokers from the nuclear industry made their case that the atom would play a big role in a cleaner-energy world.

The reception was a counterpoint to weekend exhortations by the anti-nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott, who urged marchers outside the Bella Center to reject nuclear power as a “wicked” technology spewing waste and plutonium.

Laurent Corbier, vice president for sustainable development for Areva, the French electricity provider, triumphantly noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change listed nuclear power as a suitable "mitigation technology” in its 2007 report.

But he warned that some countries were trying to exclude nuclear plants along with large dams from lists of projects that countries could get credit for as steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions under a proposed global treaty. “Nuclear must be part of the solution,” he declared.

Thomas M. Kerr, a senior energy analyst from the International Energy Agency in Paris, said that nuclear plants would have to play some role in meeting the energy needs of a growing human population while fossil-fuel emissions were reduced.

But nuclear plants alone will not meet the challenge, he said. So after snatching one more hors d’oeuvre, he headed for the door to hail a cab and go to a dinner with the solar industry.

One of the hardest rooms to get into in Copenhagen is the one where mayors from across the globe have gathered to boast about their green credentials.

They are part of a group called Local Governments for Sustainability, which has been holding standing-room-only presentations since the opening of the climate conference last week.

The organization has 1,100 delegates here, the largest number of any entity except Denmark, the host country.

Their numbers reflect the mushrooming effort by urban areas, where half the world’s population lives, to drive the conversation on tackling climate change and, perhaps more important, to secure financing for causes like mass transit.

Yet the mayors’ thunder was stolen to some degree on Tuesday by a governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.

Mr. Schwarzenegger made a pitch for the role of “subnational governments” like his, which is in the vanguard among American states on environmental issues.

But first he had to declare how “fantastic” it was to be in a foreign country where so many people speak with a non-American accent, just like him.

“I have been here for movie promotions and weight lifting and body building,” he mused. “I never thought I would get here as the governor of the great state of California and talking about climate change.”
637 2009-12-16 The Authors Guild, a trade group that represents writers, posted a statement on its Web site (authorsguild.org) on Tuesday disputing efforts by Random House to claim e-book rights to titles published before 1994. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that “the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats.” But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. “Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random House’s standard contracts prior to 1994,” the guild wrote. The statement continued: “Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.” Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company “respectfully disagrees” with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were “ours to maximize.”
638 2009-12-16 A day after Citigroup won approval to escape the government bailout program, a special tax break that the bank received to pave the way for its exit could become a point of contention in Washington.

After months of discussions, the Internal Revenue Service granted an exemption late Friday that allowed Citigroup to preserve a $38 billion tax benefit it stood to lose if it repaid the government. The decision essentially waived a longstanding rule that disqualified certain tax breaks if a significant ownership stake changed hands in an effort to discourage outside investors from buying tax benefits.

The Treasury Department’s plans to begin selling its one-third ownership in Citigroup, along with the bank’s planned $17 billion stock offering, would have been such an ownership change.

Without the waiver, the bank would have stood to lose much of those tax benefits as it recovered and it could have been significantly weakened, if not imperiled. Of the $38 billion of tax benefits, it has been allowed to count about $13 billion toward its regulatory capital requirements.

The ruling raises questions about whether federal officials moved too quickly to allow Citigroup to begin untangling itself from the government, given its fragile health. It also may lead to further scrutiny from lawmakers about whether the bank received favorable treatment.

A similar issue arose after Wells Fargo received an 11th-hour tax ruling that paved the way for its takeover of the Wachovia Corporation last year. At that time, officials from Citigroup, the losing bidder, complained that Wells received special treatment to do a deal.

Citigroup and federal officials had discussed the tax issues since late last summer as they worked through potential hurdles to the bank’s payback plans.

658 2009-12-17 F. William McCalpin, one of the earliest advocates and most vocal defenders of the Legal Services Corporation, a federal program that has provided legal aid to millions of poor people, died Dec. 9 at his home in St. Louis. He was 88.

The cause was complications from a fall, his son William said.

Mr. McCalpin, who butted heads with the Reagan administration when it sought to eliminate the program he had long championed, was chairman of the corporation from 1979 through 1981 and a member of its board from 1993 to 2003.

Legal Services was created by Congress in 1974 with the backing of President Richard M. Nixon and, with federal financing, today supports 137 organizations in all 50 states. The organizations offer legal representation to about one million poor people involved in noncriminal cases and legal advice to five million more.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan tried to abolish the Legal Services Corporation by cutting its $321 million allocation from the federal budget. Reagan had long maintained that legal aid lawyers were activists too willing to pursue their own vision of the public interest.

Over the years, legal aid lawyers have filed many class-action and law-reform suits, among them efforts to force federal, state and local governments to pay benefits mandated by social welfare legislation, to improve hospital services for the poor and to improve prison conditions. The lawyers have spent most of their time, however, on routine matters like family disputes, disability claims and landlord-tenant problems.
659 2009-12-17 Along the way, Mr. Disney organized Shamrock Holdings, a family investment enterprise that became known for instigating hostile takeovers, including an ultimately failed one of Polaroid in the late 1980s.

“Roy was a man who was steadfastly loyal to his principles,” said Stanley Gold, Shamrock’s president. “He was a gracious, humble gentleman who could make the tough decisions life sometimes requires.”

Roy E. Disney was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 10, 1930, and had a childhood that most people can only dream about. While playing at the studio, his uncle would occasionally take a break to read storybooks to him. Mr. Disney once remarked: “The animators used to test stuff out on me. They’d say, ‘Come on in and watch this and see if you think it’s funny.’ ”

Mr. Disney began his entertainment career in 1952 as an assistant film editor on “Dragnet,” the landmark television show. He joined Disney in 1953 and worked on nature documentaries like “The Living Desert” and “The Vanishing Prairie,” which both won Oscars. He also wrote for “Zorro.”

Although he retained a board seat, he left the company in 1977 after disagreements with Mr. Miller and became an independent producer.

Returning to the company in 1984, Mr. Disney set about revitalizing the floundering animation division. He obtained financing, for instance, for a computerized postproduction facility, helping to make possible the revolving ballroom scene in “Beauty and the Beast.”

Walt Disney had planned a sequel to “Fantasia,” the groundbreaking 1942 film that used animation to interpret classical music, but he died in 1966 before he could complete it. His nephew, Roy, took over the project and made it his passion, spending nine years on its execution. “Fantasia 2000” sold about $91 million in tickets worldwide, a disappointing total given its cost and time commitment.

Mr. Disney also pursued sailing. He set time records for offshore yacht racing on the Pacific Ocean, including the Los Angeles-to-Honolulu Transpac Race, which he won in his boat, the Pyewacket, in 1999 in just over seven days. A vacation home — a castle, actually — in Ireland was a favorite retreat.

Mr. Disney resigned for the second time in 2003 citing “serious differences of opinion about the direction and style of management” and started agitating for Mr. Eisner’s ouster. In 2005, after Mr. Eisner had announced his departure, Mr. Disney became director emeritus and a consultant, titles he held until his death.

Survivors include his wife, Leslie DeMeuse Disney. He is also survived by his former wife of 52 years, Patricia Dailey Disney, and four of their children: Tim, Roy Patrick, Abigail and Susan Disney Lord; and by 16 grandchildren.

Mr. Disney was a big fan of referring to the past to define the future. He told a biographer: “The goal is to look over our shoulder and see Snow White and Pinocchio and Dumbo standing there saying, ‘Be this good.’ We shouldn’t be intimidated by them; they’re an arrow pointing someplace.”
660 2009-12-17 The Federal Trade Commission has, at long last, brought an antitrust suit against Intel. The leviathan of the microchip industry has used its enormous market power — it controls 80 percent of the global microprocessor market and more than half the market for graphics chips — to shut rivals out, suppressing competition and reducing consumers’ choices.

If successful, the F.T.C.’s case could open the door to increased innovation from rival firms in one of the most vital sectors of the American economy.

Intel has suffered a string of legal challenges and defeats around the world. In May, the European Commission fined it $1.5 billion for abusing its power by offering illegal rebates to computer makers that purchased all or most of their chips from Intel and threatening to punish those who bought too much from rivals. Japan and South Korea have also acted against Intel.

In November, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York filed an antitrust suit against Intel. That month, the company paid $1.25 billion to settle a suit brought by its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices, for allegedly using illegal tactics to defend its near-monopoly.

The F.T.C.’s case is broader. It charges that Intel redesigned software to slow the performance of A.M.D.’s chips. And it argues that Intel is applying the same bullying strategy to the growing market for graphics chips used to run video on computers. It alleges Intel has engineered its processors to ensure that graphics chips made by A.M.D. and another rival, Nvidia, won’t run smoothly on a computer that uses an Intel central processor.

The F.T.C. wants Intel to stop using threats, bundled prices or other offers to encourage exclusive deals, hamper competition or distort prices. It said it may seek an order stopping Intel from making or distributing products that impair the performance of rival chips. Intel says the F.T.C. case is misguided and argues that the remedies would hinder product improvements, limit its ability to protect its intellectual property and make it impossible for the company to compete on price.
661 2009-12-17 But the commission, in 2004, and the appeals court, in 2007, dismissed Microsoft's arguments, and Microsoft abandoned its efforts to overturn the ruling in October 2007 after paying the equivalent of $2.4 billion in fines and penalties.

The outcome Wednesday, said Graham Taylor, the chief executive of Open Forum Europe, puts an exclamation point on the regulatory mood in Europe.

"The European settlement sends an unambiguous message to the market: software lock-in is dead," said Mr. Taylor, whose group supports the open-source movement. "Competitive, free choice should be the norm."

The settlement also capped a highly successful term for Ms. Kroes, who has wrung concessions from some of the top U.S. technology companies during her final year in office.

"Ms. Kroes's big contribution has been to raise the fines," said Annette Schild, a competition lawyer in Brussels at Arnold & Porter. "That has really raised the pain threshold and contributed to the commission's rising stature in antitrust cases."

Chastened by its setbacks, Microsoft had begun to slowly change its strategy two years ago, announcing that it would move toward sharing information with competitors. In the settlement, Microsoft agreed to divulge more information about the secret coding it uses to allow competitors to meld their products to Windows-based systems.

"We look forward to building on the dialogue and trust that has been established between Microsoft and the commission and to extending our industry leadership on interoperability," Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in a statement.

Beyond the realities of the stricter European antitrust regime, what had happened to undermine Microsoft's business model in the interim, according to software and legal experts, was a significant shift in software industry practices toward openness and sharing.

First in Europe, and later in the United States, a movement began parallel with Microsoft's legal travails toward open-source software, in which companies created a product and gave it away for free on the condition that developers who incorporated the free innovations in their own products also pass them along without any legal strings attached.

Microsoft, the staunch defender of closed, proprietary software systems, was suddenly on the defensive. Its aggressive rebuttals in Europe had brought Microsoft a steady drumbeat of negative publicity. The founder, Mr. Gates, had even been hit in the face with a cream pie in 1998 while on a public visit to Brussels.

Mitchell Baker, the chairman of the Mozilla Foundation, which oversees development of Internet Explorer's biggest browser competitor, Firefox, said the European settlement reaffirmed the principles of self-determination and individual empowerment for computer users, giving them the maximum flexibility to piece together systems from different software.

"These principles are expressed in several components of today's announcement and together should result in a greater respect for individual human decisions," Mr. Baker wrote in his personal blog after the commission's announcement.

Whether the European commission's settlement shakes up the European browser market, which Microsoft dominates, remains to be seen.

Rival browser makers said the agreement represented a huge opportunity for their own products, which they said would also give Europeans more choice and a better ability to compare.

"I think this settlement has the potential to change the status quo," said Sundar Pichai, the head of the Google Chrome browser team and the Chrome Web-based operating system. "Most consumers in the past have chosen Internet Explorer because it came on their computers. Now the decision will be made on the merits."

Internet Explorer had 62 percent of the European market in September, according to AT Internet Institute, a research company that tracks browser use in Merignac, France. That was followed by Firefox with 28.4 percent, Apple's Safari with 4.3 percent, Google's Chrome at 2.8 percent, and Opera at 2.2 percent.

Nicolas Babin, the chief operating officer of AT Internet, said it was unclear what the settlement's effect on the market would be.

"People already have this choice anyway," Mr. Babin said, referring to the ability to download free browsers. "Perhaps because it will be thrust in their face, it may have an impact. But it's difficult to say at this point what that will be."

Under terms of the European settlement, Microsoft will, by mid-March, send ballot screens via automatic software updates to 100 million users of Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 operating systems in Europe who have set Internet Explorer as their main browser.

Microsoft agreed to send the ballot screens to purchasers of new Windows-based computers, an estimated 30 million a year. Computer makers also gained the ability to turn off Internet Explorer and install rival browsers.

"Millions of European consumers will benefit from this decision by having a free choice about which Web browser they use," Ms. Kroes said in a statement.

On the ballot screen, consumers initially will be able to choose from Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, , Maxthon, K-Meleon, Flock, Avant Browser, Sleipnir and Slim Browser. The first five, which are the most widely used, will be prominently displayed, and the others will be shown when a user scrolls sideways on the screen.

Maxthon, whose investors include Google, Charles River Ventures and Morton Lund, an early investor in , gives away its browser and earns money from Google and by sending its browser users to their search engines.

"Maxthon has been downloaded 300 million times," said Jeff Chen, the Maxthon founder and chief executive. "We have lots of European users and we want more to know our browser."
662 2009-12-17 In all three cases, after other Homeland Security Department officials raised concerns, copies of the reports were destroyed. The agency also held a workshop on intelligence-gathering “while ensuring the protection of civil rights and civil liberties” after the Nation of Islam incident.

The documents were released by the Justice Department in connection with a lawsuit filed by the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. It had sought reports to the Intelligence Oversight Board, a watchdog panel appointed by the president, by various agencies documenting violations of law, executive orders or presidential directives.

Marcia Hofmann, a staff lawyer with the foundation, praised agency officials for destroying the reports but said the public needed to know about such incidents.

“I think it’s a positive sign that these agencies responded to this and took steps to correct the situation,” Ms. Hofmann said, adding, “We would never have known that this happened had we not seen these internal reports.”

Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said, “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect the civil rights and liberties of the American people while” protecting the country.

Other documents released Wednesday were heavily censored because they involved classified information.

A February 2008 report from the National Security Agency, for example, has four pages almost entirely redacted, under the heading of intelligence activities “that violate law, regulation, or policy substantiated during the quarter, as well as actions taken as a result of the violations.”

In a 2007 report, top security agency officials said “intelligence oversight training is not managed effectively” at the N.S.A. and called procedures regarding training “confusing.”

A spokeswoman for the N.S.A., Judith A. Emmel, said that since 2007 the agency had “improved its oversight training program and continues to refine it.”

“Ensuring our work force is thoroughly and properly trained is something we take very seriously,” Ms. Emmel said.

Another memorandum disclosed that a Defense Intelligence Agency employee said that in May 2002, in response to a Congressional inquiry, the Joint Forces Intelligence Command provided false information about its activities related to Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 attacks. The document offered few details.

The Justice Department also released other documents Wednesday from other Freedom of Information Act lawsuits related to national security policies during the Bush administration.

Among them was a letter written in 2002 by George J. Tenet, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, suggesting that a C.I.A. ban on using journalists as spies was not airtight.

After Islamic militants killed Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter whom they had falsely accused of working for the C.I.A., leaders of the American Society of Newspaper Editors asked Mr. Tenet to “declare unequivocally” that the agency’s spies never posed as journalists.

Mr. Tenet replied that for 25 years, the agency’s policy had been “that we do not use American journalists as agents or American news organizations for cover.” But he refused to make what he described as “a blanket statement that we would never use journalistic cover.”

Instead, he wrote, “the circumstances under which I would even consider any exception to this policy would have to be truly extraordinary.”
663 2009-12-17 The floors in this and the other basement rooms — which include Mr. Cross’s dressing room, bathroom and sleeping nook — are, of course, marble.

“And you know what’s great about being in the basement?” he says. “Touch the floor.”

One stoops to find the marble is warm.

“People pay a lot for radiant heat,” he says. “I’ve got it. It’s nice on the tootsies.”

Do you think less is more? Do you like your homes and holidays understated, with perhaps only a single silvered branch in a vase? Then Mr. Cross, who is 48 and makes frequent trips to Paris to find things for his clients, is not your kind of man. He redecorates twice a year and holds close to his heart the words of a dying friend: “The only things you’ll regret in life are the ones you didn’t buy.”

Were he an animal, he would be one of those fluffy ones that leap straight up in the air with excitement when they see something they love. (“Italian glass pomegranates!” Boing!) And he is excited frequently.

The wreaths on his front door are made of peacock feathers and from there, you can hear the Village People playing inside.

“To me, Christmas is silver and pink,” Mr. Cross says. “I just like to have fun and enjoy it.” The disco, he adds, is only from noon on — in the morning, it’s Handel’s “Messiah”and “The Nutcracker Suite.”

When it comes to home design tricks, there’s a lot you can learn from a department store display artist. Mr. Cross’s apartment, on the corner of Barrow and Commerce, two of the prettiest streets in the Village, was hardly an ideal space when he moved into the building in 2004. His ground-level studio apartment was 9 feet at its widest point and 60 feet deep. Two basement apartments divided by a hallway, which Mr. Cross would eventually take over, were the same width, and backed by the boiler room. Unused for 70 years, they had fallen into disrepair; sections of the floor were mud.

The width of the rooms remains the same, but the eye is tricked by the use of mirrors, inside and out. To make maximum use of the three-foot-wide air shaft outside his windows on the basement level, Mr. Cross affixed mirrors to the walls of the adjoining building, put in some of the fake foliage beloved of stylists — in this case, fake boxwood hedges — and added real Spanish moss.

“Spanish moss is nature’s fringe,” he says. “And I’m big on fringe.”

Even the smallest spaces are used: a three-by-three-foot dumbwaiter in the basement was converted to a full bathroom with a shower, with toiletries in recessed nooks. The backyard is now home to Mr. Cross’s all-weather tent with a fireplace and television, a cocktail table from Radio City Music Hall and cashmere throws. Outside the tent are a table and chairs and a silver-sprayed bust of Louis XIV, and this space, too, has been expanded with a wall of mirrors and more Spanish moss.

Mr. Cross estimates that he has put about $300,000 into the apartment — which is particularly impressive when one learns that it is a rental. His renovations include installing a marble staircase that links his two floors, and covering the basement ceiling in silk.

Decorating is simpler for him than it is for the average person because, as a designer, he employs two crews. (“Everyone should have a crew,” he says.) But it is also his great pleasure.

As Mr. Cross remembers, it was always that way. He grew up in Arkansas; his father was in the military, his mother was a trompe l’oeil artist. What better stew pot for a future display artist than a mother whose gift is tricking the eye, although it’s possible Mr. Cross’s gift for display was something he was born with: as a 6-year-old boy, he was already rearranging the furniture.

His childhood was also about change. His mother married five times; Mr. Cross says that by the time he was in high school, they had had 17 different homes. Maybe that’s why he has to redecorate so often, he mulls, over one of the bottles of Champagne that is both libation and prop. For him, stability is change.

At any rate, this weekend he will be selling not only the decorative objects he procures for clients who begin their relationship with him with a $5,000 consultation fee, but also the skin care products he creates for spas, and his personal household items. Shoppers who show up at 77 Barrow this weekend (Dec. 18 to 20, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) will be greeted by a doorman in a sparkling magenta vest and black cashmere robe. Inside, they will be able to buy almost everything they see: the silver-topped walking sticks ($50) lining the mirrored entrance hall, the mirrors themselves ($95) and any of the five fireplaces Mr. Cross purchased before he found the right one for the tent, like the French limestone fireplace with the artificial flames and space for an iPod ($900).

Upstairs, in the main-floor sitting room, there are small red leather French deco chairs ($1,800 each), an oil painting ofTennessee Williams by Ginger Wilson ($850) and a stuffed albino peacock on a six-foot Lucite stand that he calls “Old Whitey” ($3,500).

“He didn’t die to become a decorative,” Mr. Cross says. “He was immortalized after death. I waited two years for him. He came from a peacock ranch outside of Seattle.”

“One thing they told me,” he adds, “if you ever buy them as a pet, you don’t want to play rap music around them. It drives them crazy.”

He moves on, through a dining area filled with whimsical objects — a fairy swatter that looks like a fly swatter and is embedded with what look like tiny fairies ($6), absinthe-flavored gumballs ($4), toothpicks ($3) and dental floss ($4) — into the kitchen.

One of the few things not for sale is the jewel of Mr. Cross’s kitchen, a 1920s gas stove he found on the Bowery two years ago; he bought it for $150, then paid another $900 to fix it up. Just about everything else in the kitchen is for sale, from a French Champagne stand large enough to hold four bottles ($75) to the Marie Antoinette doll with the removable head ($15). There is also a French compote and a raised ceramic dessert plate with a glass dome ($65) covering a delicious looking stack of miniature frosted muffins.

“I lacquered them,” Mr. Cross says, revealing yet another display trick.

When was that?

But he only just decided to hold this sale a few weeks ago.

“I always have muffins, because I think it’s pretty,” he says. “When I first bought this compote, I would go to the Cupcake Café and get cupcakes and eat them and I would get fat. So I just got these muffins and sprayed them — dietary decorating.”

But he loves that dish, does he not?

“I like to move on,” Mr. Cross says. “There’s a big world out there, and the winner owns everything. It’s nice and I liked it, and I can pass it on.”
664 2009-12-17 Swiss officials said a decision would be made shortly about whether the filmmaker Roman Polanski would be extradited to the United States, The Associated Press reported. Folco Galli, a spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry, told The A.P. that a decision would be made “early next year” about whether Mr. Polanski, the 76-year-old filmmaker, would be handed over to authorities in the United States. Mr. Galli said that a request by American authorities was still being reviewed, as was an argument by Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, who say that he should be able to fight the charges in absentia while he is under house arrest in Switzerland. Mr. Polanski has been a fugitive from the United States, which he fled in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl.
665 2009-12-17 This is a story about money and marriage on Wall Street  one about a fugitive, a billionaire, an ex-wife and her lawsuit.

It begins happily enough, 30 years ago this month, when a Wall Street trader named Steven A. Cohen married his sweetheart, Patricia Finke.

Today, Mr. Cohen is among the world’s richest hedge fund managers, with a $6 billion fortune. And Ms. Cohen, whom he divorced long ago, is leveling some startling accusations.

In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, Ms. Cohen claims her ex-husband hid millions of dollars from her  a common enough complaint as big-money divorces go.

But here the story takes an odd turn. Some of those millions, Ms. Cohen claims in her suit, were reaped through insider trading in the 1980s.

And to hide his millions, the complaint asserts, Mr. Cohen funneled money through a New York real estate operator who was later convicted on fraud charges and then fled to Costa Rica, where he was eventually tracked down.

If Ms. Cohen’s claims are shocking, her motive is perhaps less so. She wants money  lots of it. She is seeking $300 million. But as in other divorce cases involving prominent business figures, the case threatens to turn on a spotlight on private business dealings.

In Ms. Cohen’s version of events, her husband and his brother, Donald Cohen, orchestrated a long-running racketeering scheme. She says her former husband lied under oath about his net worth, conducted mail and wire fraud, and concealed from her and the Supreme Court of New York millions of dollars that he possessed in 1990, thus reducing her divorce settlement.

Even in this post-Madoff era, the accusations might seem outlandish. Mr. Cohen, known as Stevie, is one of the nation’s most successful money managers. With a $13 billion hedge fund and a sumptuous Connecticut estate, he is, at 53, a Wall Street legend.

But all of this comes at an uncomfortable moment for Mr. Cohen and his company, SAC Capital Advisors. Since federal prospectors began making arrests in a major insider trading investigation in October, SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., has been linked to the case.

A former SAC analyst has pleaded guilty on charges related to insider trading that occurred years after he left the firm and has agreed to provide any information he might have about insider trading that occurred when he was at SAC. No current SAC employee or manager has been charged with wrongdoing.

Responding to the suit, a SAC spokesman, Jonathan Gasthalter, said Wednesday in a statement: “These are ludicrous allegations made by a former spouse that are entirely without merit. It is disgraceful that a member of the bar would assist her in what can only be considered a transparent attempt to extort money.”

Donald Cohen didn’t respond to voice mail messages on Wednesday. Ms. Cohen declined to comment for this article, but her lawyer, Paul Batista, did not mince words.

“What I look forward to most is the day when Steve Cohen has to face 12 people on a jury and have to answer for what he did to his former wife,” Mr. Batista said.

The brouhaha opens a window into life of one of Wall Street’s most secretive characters. Mr. Cohen is rarely seen in public. He lives in his own private Xanadu  a 14-acre estate with a basketball court and ice rink in Greenwich, Conn.

He has also amassed one of the world’s most significant collections of 20th-century art, with masterpieces by the likes of Jackson Pollock, Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch. He and his current wife, Alexandra, whom he married in 1992, have four children.

While Mr. Cohen was making his name and fortune, his former wife lived in relative obscurity, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She raised the couple’s two children, now in their 20s, and dabbled in real estate.

In her complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, Ms. Cohen asserts that for two decades Steven and Donald Cohen hid millions of dollars from her and tax authorities with the help of Brett K. Lurie, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen who became a partner in real estate deals. Mr. Lurie, who was convicted in 1994 on a range of charges and later caught in Costa Rica, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
666 2009-12-17 They referred to banks with code names like “Iron” and “Wood.” Sometimes they just used initials.

For nearly two decades, employees of Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest bank after UBS, helped their clients in Iran and other countries avoid sanctions by concealing their identities when they did business with the United States, federal and New York State authorities said at separate news conferences on Wednesday.

Credit Suisse ended the practicing of helping its clients skirt sanctions in 2006 and agreed to pay federal and state authorities $536 million to settle the charges.

“Credit Suisse abused its standing as a leader in international banking by intentionally processing these illegal payments through U.S. banks,” Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, told reporters in his office.

The announcement was the culmination of a two-year joint investigation by Mr. Morgenthau’s office, and the Justice Department and Treasury Department.
667 2009-12-17 M sued J.F.S. He lost, but that ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal last summer. The school then appealed that ruling; its appeal was dismissed in Wednesday’s decision.

“The ruling represents a definitive end to six decades of exclusion of children who are devout in their Jewish faith, but considered by some to be not quite Jewish enough to enjoy the benefits of their community’s leading faith school,” John Halford, a lawyer for M, said in a statement.

The ruling was a blow to the school, which had already hastily altered its admissions policies because of the earlier court ruling. Now, applicants prove their Jewishness according to a “religious practice test” amassing points for things like going to synagogue and doing charitable work.

In a statement, Russell Kett, chairman of J.F.S.’s governors, said the school had preferred its Orthodox-defined test of Jewishness to its current policy. The altered system, he said, concerned “a series of factors which themselves have no relevance under Jewish law but which seem to support the notion of a test of Jewish practice required by the English legal system.”

The case rested on whether the school’s test of Jewishness was essentially based on religion, which would be legal, or on race and ethnicity, which would not be. Five of the nine Supreme Court judges who heard the case ruled that J.F.S.’s policy directly discriminated on the basis of ethnicity. Two ruled that the policy was indirectly discriminatory. The two dissenters said that the admissions requirement was a religious one that did not depend on ethnicity and violated no laws.

A number of parties formally intervened in court, including the British government, which supported the school; and the British Humanist Association and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which supported M.

Many Jews of all branches deplored the fact that the matter had even come to court, saying that it should have been handled within the community. But critics of the chief rabbi and the admissions policy said they welcomed the chance to make the school more representative of the broader Jewish population.

David Lightman, an alumnus of J.F.S. who keeps kosher, whose wife is a convert to Judaism and whose daughter was also denied entry to the school on the grounds that it did not recognize the conversion, said that the school’s old admissions policy was narrow-minded and divisive.

His wife is the head of the school’s English department, he said; his daughter, now 15, teaches Hebrew classes. Why, he asked, should they be considered less Jewish than, say, a nonbelieving atheist whose mother happens to be Jewish?

“God can work it out,” Mr. Lightman said. “He’s a big boy; he’s been around for a long time. He can decide who’s Jewish and who isn’t.”

Britain has nearly 7,000 publicly financed religious schools. The ruling will have repercussions for all the country’s Jewish schools, whether private or public, and may also affect Sikh and Muslim schools.

Several of the judges said that that perhaps the law should be amended to accommodate J.F.S.’s concerns. And they asserted that the school was not racist according to the general definition of the word. Its test of Jewishness was in fact a legitimate religious test, they said, albeit one that, unfortunately, clashed with the law.
668 2009-12-17 The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, said the missile test “does make the case for us moving further on sanctions,” according to The Associated Press.

Iranian television gave a brief report on Wednesday of a successful test of the two-stage, solid-fuel missile called a Sejil-2. Iran’s defense minister, Ahmad Vahidi, said that the new missile was faster, more accurate and harder to shoot down than earlier versions and that it increased “the country’s technical and tactical powers,” according to Iran’s official news agency.

Iran was clearly sending a warning to the West and to Israel, regional experts said.

“It shows that Iran has the ability to stir unrest in the region and impact U.S. interests,” said Mustafa el-Labbad, director of the East Center for Regional and Strategic Studies in Cairo. “It can reach the oil fields on the other side of the gulf.”

Iran’s test worsened already tense relations with the West over the breakdown in efforts to diplomatically resolve a dispute over its nuclear program. A deal in which Iran was to ship most of its low-enriched uranium abroad to be returned as higher processed fuel for a medical reactor was announced in October, but quickly became a political liability inside Iran. The Iranian government has tried to reshape the deal to something that could be sold at home, issuing terms the West has already rejected.

At the same time, Iran’s military has put on a show of force. Last month, the military staged five days of war games specifically aimed at discouraging an Israeli attack on its nuclear sites, and officials warned they could hit Tel Aviv if they chose.

The latest missile test raises the stakes for negotiators and for Iran’s neighbors.

“This is the missile of greatest concern at this point,” said Valerie Lincy, a senior associate at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a nonprofit organization working to stem the proliferation of unconventional weapons that operates under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. “So the fact that they’re testing it now is worrisome in of itself and worrisome if you put it in the context of what’s going on with the nuclear program.”

Though the range of this rocket is comparable to the liquid-fueled Shahab III, which Iran first obtained from North Korea, a solid-fuel rocket is easier to use on short notice, easier to hide from attack, and more accurate, experts said.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, an ideologically driven military, political and economic powerhouse, controls both the missile program and the nuclear program. The West has accused Iran of trying to build nuclear weapons, which it has denied, insisting that it is developing civilian nuclear technology. As that conflict has burned for years, the Revolutionary Guards has worked aggressively to enhance the missile program.

The decision to make this test comes against a backdrop of Iran’s own internal political crisis touched off by the disputed presidential election in June. The Revolutionary Guards has taken control of internal security and has been uncompromising domestically and internationally. Internally, the corps leaders have called for arresting leaders of the reform movement and internationally they have rejected any compromise on the nuclear program.

Political analysts said that the Revolutionary Guards might benefit from heightened conflict with the West and even from tougher sanctions, allowing the force to protect its economic and political interests.

“Iran is rational,” Mr. Labbad said. “It likes to appear as though it’s crazy. But they know very well to what level they are escalating this to.”
669 2009-12-17 “The agency is very focused on the danger that these high-technology markets move on,” said George S. Cary, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in , who is a former senior F.T.C. official. “They are looking to the future.”

In its complaint, the F.T.C. accused Intel of conducting a systematic campaign to block rivals from selling their microchips by cutting off access to the market.

The filing goes beyond charges in cases brought recently by European regulators and the attorney general, which focused on microprocessors. Intel supplies about 80 percent of the PC microprocessor chips used worldwide.

The F.T.C. move, according to Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, is “very significant because it is broader in scope than any of the current cases.”

The agency contends that Intel engaged in a pattern of conduct that “put the brakes on superior competitive products that threatened” its microchip market share.

“Intel has engaged in a deliberate campaign to hamstring competitive threats to its monopoly,” said Richard A. Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition. “It’s been running roughshod over the principles of fair play and the laws protecting competition on the merits.”

The agency’s action comes after a yearlong investigation — and one month after Intel reached a sweeping $1.25 billion settlement with its longtime rival in the chip market, A.M.D.

That settlement, covering both private antitrust and patent claims, was seen as possibly deterring the agency from moving ahead. In its long-running legal fight with Intel, A.M.D. was both the principal victim of the giant chip maker and its nemesis, generating most of the evidence that was then used by government regulators around the world.

Intel and the F.T.C. tried to reach a settlement, but those talks foundered in recent days. Intel contends that the agency’s staff brought up the accusations about graphics chips and chip-related software late in the talks, asking about some details as recently as Dec. 8.

The F.T.C. action was “misguided and unwarranted,” said Intel’s general counsel, A. Douglas Melamed.

The case, Mr. Melamed said, “could have, and should have, been settled.” The behavioral changes that the F.T.C. is seeking, he added, amount to “new rules for micromanaging business conduct” and a potentially “dangerous turn for U.S. law.”

As a remedy, the commission is seeking an order that would prevent Intel from using threats, bundled prices, or other offers to encourage exclusive deals, hamper competition, or unfairly manipulate the prices of its microprocessors or graphics chips. The F.T.C. is also proposing requirements that Intel submit some business decisions for prior agency approval and agree to continuing commission monitoring of many of its practices.

Mr. Melamed said that the commission’s recommended remedial steps would unfairly constrain Intel’s pricing and marketing, hinder product design and innovation, and force the company to give away its intellectual property.

The complaint is an administrative action, which will be heard before a single administrative law judge within the F.T.C., with the trial starting next September. That trial is expected to be completed a few months later, much faster than if an antitrust case were tried in federal court, Mr. Feinstein said.

Still, the ruling by the administrative judge can be appealed to the five commissioners, who act as judges, and later to a federal appeals court — unless Intel reaches a settlement somewhere along the way.

The F.T.C. staff filing is a 24-page enumeration of Intel’s reported anticompetitive acts. It contains no quotes from seemingly incriminating e-mail messages or notes of conversations between Intel executives and personal computer makers, as did the New York State complaint, for example.

But the F.T.C. accusations do extend beyond the charges in other pending complaints, which have focused mainly on claims that Intel has systematically used large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to persuade computer makers to use its microprocessor chips instead of those made by A.M.D.

Besides those charges, the F.T.C. complaint accuses Intel of taking a series of steps to hinder competition in the market for graphics processing chips, which are increasingly important in running video and movies on computers. Some graphics chip makers, including Nvidia, are even building heavy-duty corporate computers from such chips.
670 2009-12-17 Earlier this year, the Obama administration undertook a review of American policy toward Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and decided to seek a new approach, including direct talks with the junta.

“A policy of pragmatic engagement with the Burmese authorities holds the best hope for advancing our goals,” Mr. Campbell said in testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in October. “A central element of this approach is a direct, senior-level dialogue with representatives of the Burmese leadership.”

But Mr. Campbell said a wide array of sanctions against Myanmar would not be immediately relaxed, and improved bilateral relations depended on the government’s making “real progress on democracy and human rights,” a demand reiterated by President Obama at a regional summit meeting last month in Singapore.

While in Singapore, Mr. Obama sat in a meeting near the prime minister of Myanmar, Gen. Thein Sein — the first time an American president had met with a member of the military junta.

Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi met for 45 minutes on Wednesday with the National League for Democracy chairman, Aung Shwe, 92; the party secretary, U Lwin, 87; and another senior official, Lun Tin. The elderly leaders of the party are known collectively in diplomatic circles in Yangon as “the uncles.”

Their meeting, which U Lwin discussed with reporters afterward, took place less than a week before the highest court in Myanmar was scheduled to begin considering an appeal of the 18-month extension of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s longstanding house arrest. That extension, which was handed down in August, came after an American man swam to her lakeside home in May, evaded military guards and briefly stayed at the house — a breach of the terms of her detention.

One of her lawyers, Kyi Win, said this month that the hearing would most likely be a procedural affair. But a successful appeal and a lifting of her detention could allow Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to play a role in national elections that the junta has vowed to hold next year.

Analysts and diplomats say the country’s new Constitution virtually ensures the continuing dominance of the military in the political life of the country, despite the election. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would likely be barred from running for office because her husband, who died in 1999, was a foreigner.

Her party won a landslide victory in national elections in 1990, and she was elected prime minister. The election results were annulled by the junta, which has continued to govern ever since.
671 2009-12-17 Ms. Perry had a Come to Fashion moment at the Courrèges boutique in Paris in 1997 and has since been an avid collector of 1960s fashion. Apparently limitless resources have enabled her to explore the most whacked-out refinements of her own sense of style, which, in a nutshell, is that of André Courrèges.

As a designer, Ms. Perry’s Courrèges influence is derivative unto that hazy vanishing point wherein tribute is nearly indistinguishable from straight up copycatting, but this is so blatant that it isn’t really an issue. She doesn’t seem to be promoting herself as designer as much as super-fan, spreading the joy and making the look more available, that the world might become a more modular place to frug.

Ms. Perry is a staunch champion of the retro-futuristic aesthetic occupied by the “2001: A Space Odyssey” stewardesses, “Sleeper” and, to be even more geek-specific, Rudi Gernreich’s costumes for the first season of “Space: 1999.” It is a world in which walls and floors are white, chairs are white plastic things in organic curves, minidresses come in a Peter Max Jell-O rainbow of colors, and there are large photos of Twiggy.

If your childhood was infected by remnants of the early 1970s, some stuff will make you pleasantly nostalgic, or you will hemorrhage Special Sauce out of your ears. Clear plastic bubble umbrellas are $30; a wall of alphabet key chains evoke those magnetic letters we toddlers rearranged at the bottom of the refrigerator ($8).

THE clothing is almost entirely made in good, thick wool jersey, the choice of a girl who really knows her textiles. A black minidress trimmed with patent leather is $1,095; the matching patent Mod jacket is $1,595. The matching baby version of the jacket, should you be so Joan Crawfordishly inclined as to dress thy infant identically to thyself, is $250.

I tried the Puff skirt, a black pleated tennis style with an ivory waistband ($495). I found it to be too puffy for my stick legs, as was the Lady dress ($995), which bubbled out at the hips in a way that made me wonder if Ms. Perry’s designs are built with a ’60s hourglass female body in mind.

Toward the back of the store there is an installation by Demisch Danant: a little sitting area with a wavy tricolor vintage sofa and two chairs by Pierre Paulin surrounding a glass coffee table.

Here’s a design geek-factoid fractal: In “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the contoured spacecraft seating was chosen by Stanley Kubrick from the Djinn series by Olivier Mourgue, who was a contemporary of Pierre Paulin. They were Europe’s premiere postwar furniture futurists. The costumes were designed by Hardy Amies, but the space uniforms were inspired by Courrèges. (All of Ms. Perry’s fetishes will converge in a Lucite “scent chamber” in an alternative galaxy during the 108,000th episode of “Battlestar Galactica.”)

Courrèges himself was a victim of predatory capitalism. In 1985, the designer was forced to sell a controlling interest in his brand to a Japanese conglomerate, with the understanding that the artistic soul of his operation, the money-losing couture, would be maintained with revenue from the ready-to-wear collection. Once the ink was dry, the Japanese company promptly reneged and the couture line was shut down. A heartbroken Courrèges went on strike. France was horrified in sympathy, but nothing could be done: Courrèges had lost control. Ms. Perry is at least keeping the design spirit of Courrèges alive, albeit under her own name.

I did find an excellent buy: an elastic belt with a black (or white) plastic hook buckle, perfect for svelting up your shapeless baby-doll smock ($50). A preferable holiday gift, methinks, to a $60 Diptyque candle.

But it all depends.

Outside of Diptyque, a Bentley was double parked. I pretended to hail a cab because I was transfixed by a vision bright enough to be seen through the blackened windows: a very young, very pale girl with bright red hair in white fur jacket jabbering on her phone in what looked like a velvety armchair. I gaped like a serf. It was like a movie vision from the 1930s. Behold: the shimmering socialite.

PERRYSCOPIC Ms. Perry’s vision goes back to a Mod-1960’s future, with kicky fashion and pow!-colorful, mood-altering stuff like vinyl Frisbee-ish place mats and big gold duffel bags. Even the groovy chicks who work here aren’t the least bit uptight.

PERRYNORMAL A generous section of the store is child-friendly. Imagine if Courrèges was the set designer of “Sesame Street.” A five-foot Ticonderoga pencil, $175; a set of multicolor crayon rings: $100.

PERRYNOID One rack contains vintage items, which one assumes came from Ms. Perry’s own closet and have enjoyed no shortage of parties — e.g., a once-white Pierre Cardin vinyl raincoat looks as if it had smoked too many cigarettes in the ’70s ... but think of the provenance ($3,000).

675 2009-12-18 SHANGHAI — The American International Group, the troubled insurance giant, has decided to submit plans later this month to raise billions of dollars next year by listing its Asian life insurance unit on the Hong Kong stock exchange, people briefed on the plans said Thursday.

The planned listing of American International Assurance is expected to help A.I.G. repay some of the huge debt it owes the United States government, which took an 80 percent stake in the company after a series of bailouts this year.

Analysts say the Hong Kong listing could raise as much as $20 billion, which would make it one of the largest public stock offerings in history.

The decision to submit a plan this month for a public listing was reported on Thursday by The Financial Times.

American International Assurance, which has more than 20 million policy holders in countries throughout Asia, is considered one of the bright spots in A.I.G.’s troubled portfolio.

This week, A.I.G. agreed to give a stake in the Asian unit to the New York Federal Reserve in exchange for forgiving a $16 billion loan that was threatening to damage A.I.G.’s credit rating.

687 2009-12-18 NATO’s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said Thursday that he saw no need for a new security treaty for Europe proposed by Russia. “We do have a framework already,” he said in Moscow, where he was trying to win Russian help for the war in Afghanistan. President Dmitri A. Medvedev published a draft post-cold-war security pact last month that he said would replace NATO and other institutions.
688 2009-12-18 Peter W. Galbraith, the American diplomat who was dismissed by the United Nations after exposing voter fraud this fall after the Afghan presidential election, has decided to challenge his dismissal, the United Nations said in a statement on Thursday.

At the time of the Aug. 20 election, Mr. Galbraith was serving as the No. 2 United Nations official in Afghanistan. He came into conflict with his boss, the Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide, over how to handle the fraud allegations. Mr. Galbraith has publicly attributed his dismissal to his feud with Mr. Eide.

The New York Times reported Thursday that senior United Nations officials charge that Mr. Galbraith also proposed a confidential mission to enlist the White House in a plan to replace the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, with someone more palatable.

Mr. Galbraith disputes that characterization, saying that he and his staff merely had internal discussions on what to do if a runoff for the presidency were delayed as a result of the fraud problems and other matters.

In an e-mail message to The Times on Thursday, Mr. Galbraith indicated that he had begun what he called “legal action” against the United Nations over his dismissal. The United Nations has an internal justice system under which such challenges can be lodged.

“I was terminated for no reason at all and this is the reason I am taking legal action,” Mr. Galbraith said in the e-mail message. “The U.N. has never given me any reason for my termination and has never offered any public explanation. After I was proven correct in what I said about election fraud, U.N. officials attempted to damage my reputation with unfounded and untrue allegations such as those made in an Oct. 12 press conference that I proposed an unconstitutional solution to Afghanistan’s election crisis.”

On Friday, Martin Nesirky, spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the reason Mr. Galbraith “was terminated was that the secretary general determined that such action would be in the interests of the organization.”
689 2009-12-18 Nike reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Thursday as cost-cutting and a steadier order book helped offset weak sales in mature markets, and its shares rose more than 3 percent.

Nike has countered declines in consumer spending mainly by cutting costs, streamlining operations and reducing marketing. It has slashed 5 percent of its global workforce, or some 1,750 jobs.

Orders for goods to be delivered from now until April fell 1 percent on a constant currency basis. That was better than some analysts had expected and an improvement from a 4 percent decline in the first quarter.

A sampling of analysts had forecast a range of flat to down 6 percent in the second quarter for the gauge.

Second-quarter net income fell 4 percent to $375 million, or 76 cents a share, from $391 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. That was better than analysts’ average forecast of earnings of 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
690 2009-12-18 A generation ago, there was just one high school for aspiring artists — Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of and and Performing Arts. Over the years, dozens of high schools have created programs focusing on the performing and visual arts as a way to attract motivated students. More than two dozen now require auditions.

Aislee has gone to four already, and has one left — on the same day she has a callback for Brooklyn High School of the Arts.

“We don’t have any days off,” Ms. Vasquez said, with a mix of pride and exasperation.

The same could be said for Talia Bornstein, who has had seven auditions at three high schools. For the last few months she has been dancing nearly 15 hours a week, including an occasional private rehearsal with a teacher who graduated from LaGuardia several years ago.

For the last nine years, Talia, 13, has taken classes at places like the Ballet School, the and the National Dance Institute, which runs several programs for public school students.

But Talia, who now attends East Side Middle School, projects an air of calm. “I might not get into anything,” she said. “One girl I know said it just like this: ‘I’ll die if I don’t get in.’ I just don’t see it that way.”

She and Aislee danced one Saturday for Frank Sinatra School of the Arts High School in Astoria, , and Aislee had to continue the next day for Professional Performing Arts High School in Midtown.

“It was good, it felt short,” Talia told her mother after emerging from her 8 a.m. Sinatra audition. Her next one was two weeks away — a callback for LaGuardia.

Aislee’s mother has meticulously kept track of her options, assembling the spreadsheet with the details of each audition, interview and application she has to complete.

Just as she arrived for her Professional Performing Arts audition, Aislee spotted a friend from her middle school, the New Voices School of Academic and Creative Arts in the South Slope, the only place where she has ever studied dance.

“It was scary,” her friend muttered. “It was really, really hard.”

The warning didn’t seem to faze Aislee, who was trying to dismiss her mother’s pleas to fix her hair, which she had swept off to the side in a somewhat messy bun. (“You never know if what they tell you is true,” Ms. Vasquez said, trying to reassure her.)

Arriving more than half an hour early, Aislee was the first in line for the second set of auditions. In all, more than 500 girls would compete for just 25 spots, the slim chances similar to those at LaGuardia and Sinatra, considered among the best performing arts schools.

Not every performing arts student dreams of joining the or the ; Aislee says she wants to be a lawyer and Talia a journalist. Some just want to keep performing in high school and perhaps make their college applications stand out.

“We see a combination of kids who heard that went here and want to be like her and then we will see kids who live, eat, sleep and breathe performing,” said Chuck Vasallo, an assistant principal of Professional Performing Arts High School. “Every application represents a person with a dream, and it’s in our hands if they’re accepted. If not, your life might go in another direction. That’s something we take very seriously. It’s a little scary, even for us.”

The auditions for his school had a professional feel, with numbers pinned to leotards and a surprising admonishment from one instructor. “If you have to wear underpants you’d better pull them up in your butt,” she demanded sternly. “I don’t want to see no panty lines.”

In groups of 50, the students — all but a few of them girls — were ushered into the warm-up room. Aislee came in first, silently sitting down to stretch out her thighs and once again, perfect her pointe. The others filed in, a few looking one another up and down.

But there wasn’t much time. Within minutes, they were dividing in half to dance in front of four instructors who would decide if they were good enough for callbacks in January. While the tip sheet given to parents suggested that the evaluators were looking for enthusiasm and a good attitude, it was clear that was not nearly enough.

In the sun-filled studio, Janet Atallah, the ballet teacher, immediately began demonstrating a routine they were expected to learn within five minutes.

“Écarté, en face, first arabesque and then three steps to pas de bourrée to final pose,” she instructed as she moved, without much explanation. “Use the plié to travel.”

A few girls followed along but several looked lost, trying to mimic what they saw as fast as they could. At the most competitive schools, there is no room for students who have had little training; they are expected to know the vocabulary and the basic technique.

A few weeks ago, Aislee had tumbled out of her LaGuardia audition almost ecstatic, so certain that she had done well that she performed for her mother in the middle of Columbus Circle. This time, when she came downstairs to meet her mother, she looked crestfallen.

“There was no way I could keep up,” she said. “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever seen. They were going so fast.”

Ms. Vasquez had never seen her so disappointed. But she was consoled by one thing — Aislee had firmly decided that Sinatra was her first choice. She will find out in March.
691 2009-12-18 The stakes for astronomy and physics could hardly be greater. If the particles are confirmed by tests at other detectors, it would mean that, after more than half a century of speculation, astronomers are zeroing in on the identity of the invisible material that accounts for 25 percent of the universe and determines the architecture of the visible universe.

Confirmation of the particles would also constitute the first evidence for a new feature of nature, called supersymmetry, that physicists have been seeking as avidly as the astronomers have been seeking dark matter. It is central to theoretical efforts like string theory, which unify all of the forces of nature into one mathematical expression.

The report ended weeks of speculation on physics blogs and in laboratory cafeterias around the world. At the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., where dark matter experts who had gathered for a two-week workshop watched the talks on the Web, Dr. Kane, who was present, described the mood at the workshop as “a high level of serious hysteria.”

Dark matter became a serious issue in the 1970s, when Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and her colleagues charted the rotation speeds of galaxies and found that they seemed to be enveloped in halos of dark matter, then called missing mass.

A wide range of astrophysical and cosmological measurements have subsequently converged on an intimidating recipe for the cosmos of 4 percent atoms, 25 percent dark matter and 70 percent a mysterious energy that has been called dark energy and has nothing to do with the news on Thursday.

The cryogenic experiment is nearly half a mile underground in an old iron mine in Soudan, Minn., to shield it from cosmic rays. It consists of a stack of germanium and silicon detectors, cooled to one-hundredth of a degree Kelvin. When a particle hits one of the detectors, it produces an electrical charge and deposits a small bit of energy in the form of heat, each of which are independently measured.

By comparing the amounts of charge and heat left behind, the collaboration’s physicists can tell so-called wimps from more mundane particles like neutrons, which are expected to flood the underground chamber from radioactivity in the rocks around it.

The team is planning a larger detector, called SuperCDMS. In the meantime, Elena Aprile of Columbia, who was also present in Santa Barbara, said the results would be tested soon by her own detector, called Xenon, filled with liquid xenon, which just began working this fall under the Alps in Italy.

“All eyes will be on Xenon,” she said in an interview a few days before, explaining that her detector, which is bigger, should see more events, adding, “Otherwise there will be a big clash.”
692 2009-12-18 Then, on Dec. 7, Mr. Ghailani’s lawyers and a prosecutor met in a conference in the chambers of the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, according to a transcript.

Judge Kaplan said he had received a letter, which has not been made public, in which “the defense has raised a question about competency of the defendant.”

According to the transcript, one defense lawyer, Peter E. Quijano, told the judge that the defense had “concerns that as a result of the residual aftereffects of the program that he was subjected to,” it may be hard for Mr. Ghailani to assist in his defense.

“It all relates back to the insidious program he was subjected to,” Mr. Quijano said, an apparent reference to his detention in the C.I.A.’s secret jails, or “black sites.”

The lawyers asked to have an expert, presumably a psychiatrist or psychologist, evaluate their client. They asked that the judge not order a separate court evaluation of Mr. Ghailani. “We believe he is in such a fragile state that we can only hazard a guess of what his reaction would be in terms of participating with such an examination,” Mr. Quijano said, according to a transcript.

Mr. Quijano added that if anyone other than an expert chosen by the defense tried to examine Mr. Ghailani, “he would blame us for it,” which would “severely jeopardize our relationship with him and our ability to continue to defend him.” The prosecutor, Michael Farbiarz, said he had no objection to the defense having an initial evaluation conducted.

Mr. Quijano noted that the expert would have to undergo a security clearance. This is presumably so that the expert could review classified material about Mr. Ghailani’s treatment, as well as the techniques used on him and what they sought to accomplish. Mr. Ghailani himself might disclose classified information.

Mr. Quijano said that the lawyers were raising the issue after reviewing certain “classified material” along with “interactions we have had with the defendant in the last couple of months.”

He told the judge the defense lawyers currently believed Mr. Ghailani “would pass the standard of competency to stand trial. “We have concerns,” he added. “We would like to explore those.”

Judge Kaplan concluded the conference by saying that apart from the defense’s recent letter, he had “absolutely no basis for believing that the defendant is not competent to stand trial.”

He would not order a hearing into the matter, he said, but would regard the issue as “an open question throughout the proceedings.”

Mr. Ghailani’s lawyers declined comment, as did the United States attorney’s office.

Competency questions were raised in the military commissions system in the cases of two Sept. 11 detainees who have been ordered tried in Manhattan, but those issues had not been resolved when those proceedings were halted.
693 2009-12-18 Here is a curious, widely forgotten episode in the history of French painting. In 1882 James Tissot returned to Paris following an 11-year sojourn as a successful painter of London society. Tissot (1836-1902) intended to produce a series of paintings of fashionable Parisian women, but one day, during a church service, he had a vision of Jesus tending to people in a ruined building. It was his Road to Damascus.

Four years later, reconfirmed in his Roman Catholic faith, he took off on a research trip to the Holy Land, beginning a 10-year campaign to illustrate the New Testament. His presentation of 270 watercolors from “The Life of Christ” in the Paris Salon of 1894 caused a sensation. Men reverently doffed their hats; women wept and knelt before the pictures, and some even crawled like penitents through the show. Two years later the profusely illustrated Tissot Bible was published, and it became an international best seller.

In 1896 Tissot sent the completed series of 350 pictures on a trans-Atlantic tour, starting in London. In New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, people paid 25 and 50 cents apiece to see it. In 1900, prompted by the American painter John Singer Sargent, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences — now the Brooklyn Museum — purchased the entire series for $60,000, then an enormous sum. The series remained on view at the museum until the 1930s, then went into storage, only to be seen in occasional small doses thereafter.

Now the museum has resurrected Tissot’s opus, displaying 124 paintings from “The Life of Christ.” It is a surprisingly intriguing and moving exhibition.

Made with deft precision in opaque watercolor (gouache) on sheets ranging from postcard- to notebook-size, the paintings offer a conventional, Victorian Academic style of slightly brushy, near-photographic realism. (Tissot used a camera on his trips to the Middle East.) The combination of miniature scale and fine rendering is often arresting. An imaginary reconstruction of Jerusalem and the Temple of Herod is a marvel of architectural and archaeological representation.

But the strength of the exhibition is less in the aesthetic quality of individual works than in the cumulative effect of the narrative, which takes us from the Annunciation to the Resurrection in great detail. The paintings are like stills from a Hollywood movie spectacular. Tissot worked hard to achieve historical accuracy, so a scene like one in which Roman soldiers hoist the cross with Jesus attached, using ropes and a temporary wooden framework, has a persuasive palpability and tragic, cinematic grandeur.
694 2009-12-18 BEIJING — The Chinese Foreign Ministry has hinted that it is seeking or will seek the return of 22 Uighurs who fled to Cambodia after the eruption of deadly ethnic riots in July in western China and a subsequent government crackdown.

The Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority group concentrated in western China whose members often say the Chinese government, dominated by ethnic Han, discriminates against them. The 22 Uighurs in Cambodia entered the country about a month ago with the aid of an underground network of Christian missionaries in China that usually helps North Koreans reach nations where they can seek refugee status.

The Uighurs made their way to the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, where they applied for refugee status at a United Nations refugee office.

This week, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said at a news conference that the Uighurs were suspected of criminal activities and that the “relevant departments” were investigating them. She said at the news conference and in a written statement sent to The New York Times on Thursday that criminals should not be allowed to take advantage of the United Nations’ refugee system.

“China’s stance is very clear: the international refugee protection system shouldn’t become a shelter where criminals stay to escape legal punishment,” she said.
695 2009-12-18 Then there are performances whose cost might be described as “next to nothing,” especially compared with the top seats at holiday entertainments like New York City Ballet’s “Nutcracker,” at the David H. Koch Theater ($215), or the Cirque du Soleil “Wintuk” show, at Madison Square Garden ($220).

Among the bargains: a 9:45 a.m. open rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall ($16 a ticket) or a recent performance by the jazz trombonist Craig Harris at the new Dwyer Cultural Center in Harlem, at St. Nicholas Avenue and 123rd Street ($7 a ticket).

At the Philharmonic rehearsal, most of the almost 2,300 available seats were filled. The audience appeared to be mostly mature, but there was a sprinkling of younger people as well to watch and listen as David Fray, the French pianist, played the Ravel Piano Concerto in G with the orchestra.

Yoshiko Ono, a 34-year-old from Astoria, Queens, who said she had just gotten laid off from her job as an accountant, was an excited first-timer. She was there with her friend Naoko Mayuzumi from Toyko, who found out about the low-cost rehearsals through a popular Japanese guide for tourists. A schedule of the rehearsals is available at the Philharmonic’s Web site (nyphil.org), and tickets can be purchased ahead of time. But at a special free open rehearsal on Sept. 16, with Renee Fleming, the ticket line formed at 5 a.m.

Which brings us to the trade-offs for those low-price tickets. “It takes a lot of effort to pay off in terms of time,” said Ala Marie Shuman, a physical therapist enjoying the atmosphere the other night at the Rubenstein Atrium, where many of the seats were taken an hour before the set.

“It’s much more complicated than any year we’ve approached,” said Cassandra Stubbs-Burton, a sixth-grade social studies teacher at M.S. 571 in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and the mother of an 11-year-old. She took her class to the Dwyer to see Mr. Harris the other day. Theater, dance, music and workshops are free or low-cost (under $10) and are listed on the Dwyer Web site (www.dwyercc.org); the popular free Saturday open house programs require reservations. “Finding performance art is more difficult,” Ms. Stubbs-Burton said. “I look through the free parenting magazines. Places like Bryant Park have a lot of free events, and City Center does some Alvin Ailey for around $20. Brooklyn College has some performances with $6 or so seats — they do “The Nutcracker” — and New Victory does $10 seats.”

But even the cultural big guns offer free and discounted tickets. At Carnegie Hall there are $10 day-of-concert seats and some partial view tickets for half price (carnegiehall.org/discounts). The Metropolitan Opera (metopera.org) offers $20 tickets Monday through Thursday if you’re willing to be one of the first 200 people in line the day of the show. Otherwise tickets cost $15 to $275.

The new year brings new bargains. Starting on Jan. 7 same-day discount tickets, at 25 percent to 50 percent off regular prices, will be available for performances at Lincoln Center and all its constituent organizations (as well as the Big Apple Circus when it is in residence). They will be sold through a new box office at Rubenstein Atrium (closed Mondays).

To celebrate, Lincoln Center is offering a special deal for the first 20 days of the program: through Jan. 26 all tickets at the new box office will be just $20. Tickets will go on sale at noon every day and will be sold, two per person, on a first-come-first-served basis. (Expect lines.)

Even at 50 percent or more, the discount tickets available at TKTS can make for a pricey evening on Broadway. But theatergoers can find a plethora of inexpensive Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway theater, including places like The Kitchen, La MaMa, Here Arts Center and Harlem Stage, which has music and other arts as well. It might not be too late to grab one of the full-price $10 tickets for “Juan and John,” created by Roger Guenveur Smith and part of the annual new play series, Public Lab, at the Public Theater through Sunday (publictheater.org). Also through Sunday there are $25 seats for the critically acclaimed “Swimming to Spalding,” inspired by Spalding Gray, at Here Arts Center (here.org).

Finally, for strapped balletomanes, during its season at the Koch Theater the New York City Ballet offers open working rehearsals four days a week, with free admission for any patron who makes an annual contribution of $90 or more. The number of rehearsals that can be attended depends on the level of giving: $90 gets you eight a year; for $1,000 you get unlimited access. Cheap? Not exactly. But maybe still a bargain.
696 2009-12-18 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — In an exceptionally heavy barrage by American drones in Pakistan, five Predator aircraft fired 10 missiles at suspected militant compounds along the border with Afghanistan on Thursday. Along with an earlier attack, at least 15 people, including 7 foreigners, were killed, Pakistani security officials said.

The stepped-up drone strikes came as the civilian government felt the repercussions of a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday that declared unconstitutional an amnesty for thousands of politicians accused of corruption.

On Thursday, the National Accountability Bureau, acting with remarkable speed, prohibited 247 people, including some cabinet ministers, from leaving the country, as corruption cases could be revived against them.

They included Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, who was stopped at the Islamabad airport, along with his wife and secretary, from boarding a flight to China, where he was scheduled to make an official visit. He complained publicly that he had not been informed of the ban.

The drone strikes included two missiles that hit at a vehicle in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, killing at least one person.
697 2009-12-18 The Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, above, reopened on Thursday after the suspension of a strike, but unions still threatened to walk out again next month. “We have reached an agreement with the unions who have decided to follow management’s invitation and negotiate,” a museum spokeswoman told Reuters. Culture ministry workers went on strike on Nov. 23 to protest planned staff reductions by the French government, fearing that more than 200 jobs could be lost at the museum over the next decade. Workers at several other major French museums and cultural institutions went on temporary strike earlier this month in sympathy, including the Musée d’Orsay, Notre Dame Cathedral and the palace at Versailles.
698 2009-12-18 John Frusciante, above, the on-again-off-again guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, announced on his Web site (johnfrusciante.com) on Wednesday that he had quit the band “over a year ago.” It is the second time he has left the group; after joining in 1988 as a replacement for its original guitarist, Hillel Slovak, who died of a heroin overdose, Mr. Frusciante, 39, left in 1992 and returned six years later. “My musical interests have led me in a different direction,” he wrote. The band has not named a replacement.
699 2009-12-18 PARIS — France’s market watchdog ruled late Thursday that 17 current and former executives of Airbus and its parent, EADS, did not violate insider-trading laws when they sold company shares three years ago.

The decision by the Financial Markets Authority followed a two-and-a-half-year investigation into assertions that managers of the two companies knew of manufacturing problems with the A380 superjumbo passenger jet when they sold EADS shares in March 2006, three months before the troubles became public. The shares plunged 26 percent on the day after the company announced a six-month delay in deliveries.

At the heart of the investigation was a series of board meetings in February and March 2006, where A380 assembly line problems were discussed. The meetings occurred shortly before a period in which directors were allowed to exercise share options.

The regulator said that it had found no evidence that what the executives were told about the A380’s troubles at that time was detailed enough for a “reasonable investor” to anticipate a significant drop in the share price. The troubles discussed at that time, the regulator found, were of a “lesser amplitude” than those that were communicated to the public on June 13, 2006.

Legal specialists said the failure to find any violation after such a long and prominent inquiry would probably be seen as a setback for the market authority.

“It’s a major failure, and it puts the AMF in a difficult spot” said Stéphane Bonifassi, a lawyer in Paris who specializes in financial crimes, referring to the regulator by its French initials. “It raises the question whether, when it comes to insider trading, we are not very efficient in Europe about sanctions.”
700 2009-12-18 Of those 23 stations, nine are equipped with both a fire engine and a ladder truck — including Station 6. But as Capt. Rick Hudson, 41, and his three colleagues pulled out in their ladder truck, sirens wailing, the station’s engine remained in its bay, unstaffed, the 500 gallons of water in its hold unused.

In flush times not so long ago, Sacramento seemed ready to shed its unfair standing as San Francisco’s dowdy sister. Its population, now around 480,000, was rapidly climbing. Developers were unveiling ambitious plans to redefine the city’s skyline, and image.

Those days now seem like a dream. This city has suffered more than most in the recession, as foreclosures soar, as revenues from property and sales taxes plummet, as a three-days-a-month furlough for state workers stifles the city’s Friday bustle. All that remains of a plan to build a skyscraping pair of condominium towers, 53 stories high, is a fenced-off downtown lot.

The city is now in its third year of crisis management, which included the need to close a $58 million budget gap last year. The exceptionally busy Fire Department, which claims to be the oldest west of the Mississippi, got off lighter than other city agencies, but it still had to cut its budget by 4 percent.

The city decided to institute rolling brownouts. Now, every 48 hours, one of those nine stations with both an engine and a ladder truck shuts its water-bearing engine down, leaving engines from other stations to answer calls in its area.

Truck 6 traced Chief Bentovoja’s path down darkened streets, past a fish market, a small high school, a funeral home. On a normal night, Engine 6 would lead the way; on a normal night, the chief said later, “the engine always gets there before the truck — by at least a minute.”

A neighbor, Rudy Martinez, 61, had already rushed across the street to make sure that two teenagers and a dog were out of the burning house, safe. Now, as the burning bamboo pop-pop-popped, he and two other neighbors were using garden hoses to water down the century-old house next door, owned by a couple who had left hours earlier on vacation.

At 8:01:01, Chief Bentovoja arrived, followed a few seconds later by Truck 6. The firefighters saw an ominous glow through the attractive gray home’s first-floor windows, licks of fire flicking over the back of its two stories, smoke pouring from the attic.

They first made certain that no one was inside. Then two firefighters climbed up to the roof with chain saws and cut a hole so that the hot smoke could escape, minimizing damage and increasing visibility.

“Those guys were amazing,” Mr. Martinez said. “It looked like the rafters were going to collapse at any second.”

The firefighters were controlling the fire, but without water, they could not stop the fire. “That’s the tough thing for me,” Captain Hudson said.

Flames engulfed a back corner of the house, while a side of that neighboring house received the intense heat radiating from a dozen feet away. Its windows cracked and burst. Its off-white paint blistered. Its attic inhaled hot, dangerous smoke.

At 8:02:15 — a solid five minutes after the initial 911 call — two fire engines arrived from other neighborhoods, farther away. Here now was much-needed water, though at least a full minute later than if Engine 6 were online. “That’s 60 seconds less of a free-burning fire,” Captain Hudson said. “Less damage to the house. No damage to the neighbor’s house.”

Unraveled hoses swelled with the rush of glorious water. A nearby hydrant flowed. Other fire engines and trucks arrived. At 8:41:51, Chief Bentovoja relayed the code that essentially says: Fire out.

In the dangerous realm of house fires, this was a success: no deaths; no injuries; extensive damage, but structure salvageable.

Gus Vina, the assistant city manager who oversees public safety issues, says resources are central to how a city manages risk — and resources these days are tight. While no one wants brownouts, he said, they were considered more palatable than another option: shutting down one of the 23 firehouses.

The brownouts, he said, are just one manifestation of a recession so severe that municipalities like Sacramento have to make fundamental decisions about what services they can no longer afford. “We all sort of fell off the cliff at the same time” with this recession, he said. “It’s very real, and there will be street-level impact.”

In this economy, an uncomfortable truth is that precious seconds must be weighed against dollars. “It is a risk calculation all the time,” Mr. Vina said.

The cause of the Curtis Park fire remains unclear. The home’s owners have been unable to return, so extensive was the damage. The couple next door, John Mathews and Nicoletta Anselmo, learned of the fire just in time, aborted their vacation, and returned home to oversee the necessary repairs. In fact, they enlisted their heroic neighbor, Mr. Martinez, a glazier, to replace the windows that burst in the heat.

Mr. Mathews, 59, whose hours at an engineering firm have been downsized to 32 from 40 a week, expressed awe for his neighbors, for fire, and for something the firefighters told him: “We were one minute away from bursting into flames.”

706 2009-12-19 Twenty-two Uighurs who fled China after ethnic rioting and sought asylum in Cambodia will be deported soon and probably sent to China, Cambodian officials said Saturday. Cambodia says the Uighurs entered the country illegally. China, calling the Uighurs criminals, had applied intense pressure for their return. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had asked Cambodia to delay any action, and the United States had urged that the Uighurs not be sent back to China.
707 2009-12-19 Re “Europe’s Minaret Moment,” by Ross Douthat (column, Dec. 7): We, part of the Geneva human rights community, are particularly embarrassed by Switzerland’s vote to ban minarets and will work energetically toward its speedy repeal.

Paradoxically, the most intolerant Islamists are likely to be strengthened by this act of bigotry, not weakened. Acts of intolerance by Western countries provide justification for banning religious freedom in Muslim countries.

These efforts have found expression at the United Nations Human Rights Council, where an Algerian-headed committee is advocating changes to an international covenant on discrimination to grant Islamic governments free rein to silence dissenters in the name of a supposed human right against “defamation of religion.” But questioning or criticism of Islamic orthodoxies by individuals — religious dissenters, human rights activists or journalists — is protected speech, and an essential part of religious and political freedom.

What a pity that Switzerland’s minaret folly — which, at the least, discourages religious expression by individuals — may end up hurting non-Muslim minorities in the Mideast as well as liberal Muslims. The overt banning of Muslim structures by a government is wrongful discrimination.
708 2009-12-19 Icelandic biologists have discovered that the genetic risk of several common diseases, like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, can depend on which parent a DNA variant is inherited from.

The finding may help explain part of a serious gap in understanding the genetics of common diseases.

Using an extensive genealogy that includes almost all the present population of Iceland and many in previous generations, the Reykjavik company DeCode Genetics managed to distinguish which chromosomes came from the father and which from the mother in some 40,000 people.

The company then ran standard tests, known as genome wide association studies, the tool that scientists have hoped would track down the roots of common diseases and fulfill the promise of the Human Genome Project.

But with most of these common diseases, the tests have so far identified genetic variants that account for only a small percentage of the risk. This is in contrast to simple diseases, most of them rare, where a single gene is the cause and the disease has a clear family pedigree.

The failure has left biologists puzzled about the missing heritability, which some have jokingly attributed to “dark matter” within the human genome, an analogy with the dark matter invoked by cosmologists to explain the missing mass of the universe.
709 2009-12-19 In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg celebrated his inauguration by holding a traditional reception at the former Tweed Courthouse. Four years later, it was a splashier affair at a bank near City Hall, with thousands of doughnuts and cupcakes, all paid for by him, as well as a performance by Liza Minnelli. But this time, the billionaire mayor is having none of that.

Mr. Bloomberg has decided to scrap the traditional ceremony after his inaugural address on New Year’s Day, according to city officials briefed on the plans. Instead, he plans to spend the day participating in public service projects across the city to help promote his N.Y.C. Service initiative. One of his projects, for instance, will be putting together care packages at Staten Island Borough Hall for local troops stationed abroad.

The mayor’s office declined to comment on his plans. But city officials close to the administration said that Mr. Bloomberg was cognizant that any kind of an inaugural gala would seem excessive or out of place during a time of economic anxiety, in a city struggling with double-digit unemployment and facing extensive cuts in subway service.

Mr. Bloomberg, the wealthiest person in the city, just spent more than $100 million to win a third term by a margin that was smaller than had been anticipated. And part of the reason that margin was smaller, political analysts say, is that a sizable portion of New Yorkers felt that the mayor had not been responsive to their complaints about middle-class pocketbook issues, like higher taxes and parking fees.

Mr. Bloomberg spent a total of more than $4 million on his first two inaugural celebrations, which featured comfort foods like mini-hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, apple cider and beer.
710 2009-12-19 Three manufacturers of a commonly used fire retardant have voluntarily agreed to phase out its production within three years in a pact with the Environmental Protection Agency.

Environmentalists have long advocated a ban on the retardant decabromodiphenyl ether, or DecaBDE, which is used widely in consumer electronics, furniture and textiles, among other items. It has been found to be a potential carcinogen and to be toxic to the nervous system.

The agreement, with the manufacturers Chemtura, Albemarle and ICL Industrial Products, would end the production, importation and use of the chemical in all consumer products by December 2012. A full ban would take effect one year later.

No accord has been reached with a Japanese manufacturer that exports products with the substance to the United States.

The chemical “persists in the environment, potentially causes cancer and may impact brain function,” Steve Owens, the E.P.A.’s top toxics official, said in announcing the deal late Thursday. Mr. Owens said it could also degrade into more toxic chemicals hazardous to wildlife.

Some states have already passed legislation prohibiting the product’s manufacture or use in certain products, and others are weighing similar laws.
711 2009-12-19 PARIS — Ryanair Holdings, Europe’s largest budget airline by passengers, said on Friday that it planned to slow its breakneck expansion and begin returning some cash to shareholders, setting off a 6 percent gain in its share price.

The airline said it had broken off negotiations with Boeing for an order for 200 jets that would have sustained a wave of growth from 2013 to 2016. The talks, which had continued for nearly a year, failed after the two sides were unable to agree on unspecified sale terms and conditions.

A sharp drop in air traffic worldwide in the last year has eroded revenue for full-service and low-cost airlines alike, prompting even the likes of Ryanair — which for years has unapologetically subordinated passenger comfort to cost control — to concede the challenges of operating in the current environment.

Ryanair said its fares dropped 17 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30 and forecast that they could fall by as much as 20 percent more in the next two quarters as it tried to lure passengers during a recession.

Analysts said, however, that Ryanair was running out of tools to push costs lower, having already cut operating expenses sharply. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has been stepping up public pressure on governments and airports to lower taxes and landing fees, and on Boeing — which has supplied the airline with its entire fleet of more than 200 jets — to cut him a better deal on planes.
712 2009-12-19 TOKYO — Japan’s prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, will soon offer written testimony to prosecutors saying that he had no direct role in a campaign finance scandal that has dogged his fledgling government, according to Japanese newspapers. But while he is widely expected to survive the scandal, analysts say it has helped feed doubts among some voters about his leadership.

There is now talk in Tokyo that voters may be showing signs of cooling toward Mr. Hatoyama’s government, which swept into power three months ago with pledges for fundamental change in Japan’s postwar order. While Mr. Hatoyama’s approval ratings remain high, they are starting to slip amid growing questions about his leadership and his ability to manage this long-stagnant nation, analysts said.

“Every day, he seems to say and do something different,” said Minoru Morita, a political commentator who runs an independent research organization in Tokyo. “This is starting to shake the people’s confidence in him.”

Most voters still appeared to be willing to give Mr. Hatoyama and his Democratic Party more time to deliver on their promises to rein in the powerful bureaucracy and build a more consumer-focused economy. But political experts warned that a failure to show results in crucial areas like reviving Japan’s moribund job market could lead to a rapid erosion of support.

At first, voters seemed not to be much bothered by the financial scandal because much of the money came from Mr. Hatoyama or his mother, a wealthy heiress. But now, analysts say, it is precisely that explanation that is starting to cool public opinion of the prime minister. By highlighting the considerable wealth of his family, the scandal is starting to raise doubts about how in touch he is with the worsening economic plight of average Japanese.
713 2009-12-19 “From now on, industries will not only care about making money,” said Mr. Srisuwan, who comes from a family of rice farmers. “They have to care about the environment and the well-being of the people in the community.”

Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem.

The injunction stopped new projects, but older, heavily polluting plants were allowed to carry on. The rulings require the government to write a new set of environmental laws. But what Thailand needs, experts say, is not new laws but better enforcement of existing ones.

“In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all,” said Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant. “Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution — you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you.”

Reports detailing how unhealthy this area is for those who live and work in the shadow of the refineries, plastics factories and other petrochemical facilities here have stacked up over the years.

Thailand’s National Cancer Institute found in 2003 that rates of cervical, bladder, breast, liver, nasal, stomach, throat and blood cancers were highest in Rayong Province, where Map Ta Phut and other industrial zones are located. A study led by Italian researchers and released in 2007 found that people living near Map Ta Phut had 65 percent higher levels of genetic damage to blood cells than people in the same province who lived in rural areas. Such cell damage, which is a possible precursor to cancer, was 120 percent higher for refinery workers than for residents of Rayong Province’s rural communities.

Marco Peluso, the lead author of the study, said it would be rare to see these levels of genetic damage in the West.

The main problem appears to be air pollution. The Thai pollution control department reported in September that it had found nine types of carcinogenic compounds in the air around Map Ta Phut.

In March, an initial court decision from the lawsuit by the 27 villagers declared Map Ta Phut a “pollution control zone,” obliging the authorities to measure soil and water quality regularly and to come up with a plan to reduce pollution if it is too high.

But the real sting for companies came in September, when another court ruled in a related lawsuit that 76 projects, most of them under construction, should immediately stop work because they were not in compliance with environmental provisions in the country’s new Constitution. The decision was upheld by a higher court early this month for all but 11 of the projects.

Among the companies affected are Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant; Aditya Birla Chemicals, an Indian conglomerate; BlueScope Steel of Australia; and two dozen companies belonging to P.T.T., the Thai energy giant.

Lawyers for the companies say the most galling aspect of the injunction is that they could not possibly comply with the law because detailed regulations have yet to be written, a problem that the government acknowledges.

The generals who carried out Thailand’s 2006 military coup promulgated a new Constitution that strengthened environmental law, requiring detailed studies before the approval of any project that causes “serious impact” to the environment or people’s health.

But “serious” was never defined, and specific guidelines for companies were never drawn up, partly because government officials had been distracted by Thailand’s continuing political turmoil.

“Right now, companies don’t know which way to turn,” said Sivapong Viriyabusaya, a partner in Bangkok at the law firm Baker & McKenzie, which is representing companies affected by the injunction. “They want to comply, but they cannot because there are no rules.”

Mr. Srisuwan, the lawyer who won the injunction, is unapologetic about the potential economic effects of the decision. “I don’t care about investors,” he said. “I don’t care about losing employment and the economy. I just care that people’s lives will be protected.”

The frustration is echoed by Noi Jaitang, a 70-year-old fruit farmer. Over the past two decades, Mr. Noi says, he has lost six members of his family to cancer. Now his wife has a cancerous tumor below her left eye. In October, Mr. Noi walked barefoot to Bangkok — about 125 miles away — to protest the pollution, which he blames for the deaths.

“It’s not that I want to burn the factories down,” he said. “We just want to be able to live together.”

The government says it is moving as quickly as it can to pass the requisite laws that will allow the injunction to be lifted. But Mr. Srisuwan calls this lawsuit only the “tip of the iceberg.”

There are 181 other factories in Thailand that are not complying with the new Constitution, including paper, steel and petroleum companies, he says. “I will file lawsuits against all of them,” Mr. Srisuwan said.
714 2009-12-19 Analysts attributed Friday’s up-and-down pattern to the so-called quadruple witching — the quarterly expiration of options and futures for stocks and stock indexes. In the past, these days have brought above-average volatility and volume as investors cash in or renew contracts.

Technology led the gains. Shares of Oracle climbed 6.38 percent, or $1.46, to $24.34, after the company said its profits were up 12.5 percent, exceeding expectations.

Shares of Research In Motion jumped 10.35 percent, or $6.57, to $70.03, because of a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings forecast.

The price of oil climbed 71 cents, to $73.36 a barrel, in part because of reports that Iranian troops had occupied one of Iraq’s largest oil fields, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad. That heightened concern about the possibility of a conflict between the two countries that would endanger oil reserves.

“It raises several questions for investors: ‘What does it mean for Iran to ultimately become a nuclear power? What is the West’s response to that situation?’ ” said Joseph V. Battipaglia, a market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. “Until there is an action taken, the market will behave as if this is going to be postponed into the New Year.”

The dollar continued its biggest rally against the euro since January. Though the dollar has retreated from its lows of $1.50 in recent months, analysts say they believe it will continue to weaken when equities trading picks up again in January.

Trading is expected to be light for the next several weeks, as investors examine their portfolios and refine their 2010 investment strategies. They must also assess the strength of the recovery, which has shown scattered signs of improvement in crucial areas like labor and housing but remains largely weak and uneven.

“While the economy is recovering, it is not an accelerating recovery,” Mr. Battipaglia said. “The last nine months in my view have been a free ride on extraordinary efforts by the government to keep the financial system afloat. Now we’re looking at what that leaves you in the aftermath.”

Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said he expected investors would add more risk to their portfolios as they positioned themselves for 2010. Mr. Lee said relatively stable retail sales and employment reports, along with a flurry of mergers and acquisitions announcements, could drive up shares early next year.

“For the most part, between now and year-end, you’re going to have a little bit of window-dressing,” Mr. Lee said. “It’s the quarter end, so you’re going to see people try to add to and improve value.”

716 2009-12-19 Icelandic biologists have discovered that the genetic risk of several common diseases, like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, can depend on which parent a DNA variant is inherited from.

The finding may help explain part of a serious gap in understanding the genetics of common diseases.

Using an extensive genealogy that includes almost all the present population of Iceland and many in previous generations, the Reykjavik company DeCode Genetics managed to distinguish which chromosomes came from the father and which from the mother in some 40,000 people.

The company then ran standard tests, known as genome wide association studies, the tool that scientists have hoped would track down the roots of common diseases and fulfill the promise of the Human Genome Project.

But with most of these common diseases, the tests have so far identified genetic variants that account for only a small percentage of the risk. This is in contrast to simple diseases, most of them rare, where a single gene is the cause and the disease has a clear family pedigree.

The failure has left biologists puzzled about the missing heritability, which some have jokingly attributed to “dark matter” within the human genome, an analogy with the dark matter invoked by cosmologists to explain the missing mass of the universe.
717 2009-12-19 PARIS — Ryanair Holdings, Europe’s largest budget airline by passengers, said on Friday that it planned to slow its breakneck expansion and begin returning some cash to shareholders, setting off a 6 percent gain in its share price.

The airline said it had broken off negotiations with Boeing for an order for 200 jets that would have sustained a wave of growth from 2013 to 2016. The talks, which had continued for nearly a year, failed after the two sides were unable to agree on unspecified sale terms and conditions.

A sharp drop in air traffic worldwide in the last year has eroded revenue for full-service and low-cost airlines alike, prompting even the likes of Ryanair — which for years has unapologetically subordinated passenger comfort to cost control — to concede the challenges of operating in the current environment.

Ryanair said its fares dropped 17 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30 and forecast that they could fall by as much as 20 percent more in the next two quarters as it tried to lure passengers during a recession.

Analysts said, however, that Ryanair was running out of tools to push costs lower, having already cut operating expenses sharply. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has been stepping up public pressure on governments and airports to lower taxes and landing fees, and on Boeing — which has supplied the airline with its entire fleet of more than 200 jets — to cut him a better deal on planes.
718 2009-12-19 TOKYO — Japan’s prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, will soon offer written testimony to prosecutors saying that he had no direct role in a campaign finance scandal that has dogged his fledgling government, according to Japanese newspapers. But while he is widely expected to survive the scandal, analysts say it has helped feed doubts among some voters about his leadership.

There is now talk in Tokyo that voters may be showing signs of cooling toward Mr. Hatoyama’s government, which swept into power three months ago with pledges for fundamental change in Japan’s postwar order. While Mr. Hatoyama’s approval ratings remain high, they are starting to slip amid growing questions about his leadership and his ability to manage this long-stagnant nation, analysts said.

“Every day, he seems to say and do something different,” said Minoru Morita, a political commentator who runs an independent research organization in Tokyo. “This is starting to shake the people’s confidence in him.”

Most voters still appeared to be willing to give Mr. Hatoyama and his Democratic Party more time to deliver on their promises to rein in the powerful bureaucracy and build a more consumer-focused economy. But political experts warned that a failure to show results in crucial areas like reviving Japan’s moribund job market could lead to a rapid erosion of support.

At first, voters seemed not to be much bothered by the financial scandal because much of the money came from Mr. Hatoyama or his mother, a wealthy heiress. But now, analysts say, it is precisely that explanation that is starting to cool public opinion of the prime minister. By highlighting the considerable wealth of his family, the scandal is starting to raise doubts about how in touch he is with the worsening economic plight of average Japanese.
719 2009-12-19 Three manufacturers of a commonly used fire retardant have voluntarily agreed to phase out its production within three years in a pact with the Environmental Protection Agency.

Environmentalists have long advocated a ban on the retardant decabromodiphenyl ether, or DecaBDE, which is used widely in consumer electronics, furniture and textiles, among other items. It has been found to be a potential carcinogen and to be toxic to the nervous system.

The agreement, with the manufacturers Chemtura, Albemarle and ICL Industrial Products, would end the production, importation and use of the chemical in all consumer products by December 2012. A full ban would take effect one year later.

No accord has been reached with a Japanese manufacturer that exports products with the substance to the United States.

The chemical “persists in the environment, potentially causes cancer and may impact brain function,” Steve Owens, the E.P.A.’s top toxics official, said in announcing the deal late Thursday. Mr. Owens said it could also degrade into more toxic chemicals hazardous to wildlife.

Some states have already passed legislation prohibiting the product’s manufacture or use in certain products, and others are weighing similar laws.
720 2009-12-19 Analysts attributed Friday’s up-and-down pattern to the so-called quadruple witching — the quarterly expiration of options and futures for stocks and stock indexes. In the past, these days have brought above-average volatility and volume as investors cash in or renew contracts.

Technology led the gains. Shares of Oracle climbed 6.38 percent, or $1.46, to $24.34, after the company said its profits were up 12.5 percent, exceeding expectations.

Shares of Research In Motion jumped 10.35 percent, or $6.57, to $70.03, because of a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings forecast.

The price of oil climbed 71 cents, to $73.36 a barrel, in part because of reports that Iranian troops had occupied one of Iraq’s largest oil fields, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad. That heightened concern about the possibility of a conflict between the two countries that would endanger oil reserves.

“It raises several questions for investors: ‘What does it mean for Iran to ultimately become a nuclear power? What is the West’s response to that situation?’ ” said Joseph V. Battipaglia, a market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. “Until there is an action taken, the market will behave as if this is going to be postponed into the New Year.”

The dollar continued its biggest rally against the euro since January. Though the dollar has retreated from its lows of $1.50 in recent months, analysts say they believe it will continue to weaken when equities trading picks up again in January.

Trading is expected to be light for the next several weeks, as investors examine their portfolios and refine their 2010 investment strategies. They must also assess the strength of the recovery, which has shown scattered signs of improvement in crucial areas like labor and housing but remains largely weak and uneven.

“While the economy is recovering, it is not an accelerating recovery,” Mr. Battipaglia said. “The last nine months in my view have been a free ride on extraordinary efforts by the government to keep the financial system afloat. Now we’re looking at what that leaves you in the aftermath.”

Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said he expected investors would add more risk to their portfolios as they positioned themselves for 2010. Mr. Lee said relatively stable retail sales and employment reports, along with a flurry of mergers and acquisitions announcements, could drive up shares early next year.

“For the most part, between now and year-end, you’re going to have a little bit of window-dressing,” Mr. Lee said. “It’s the quarter end, so you’re going to see people try to add to and improve value.”

The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 15/32, to 98 21/32. The yield rose to 3.54 percent, from 3.48 percent Thursday.
721 2009-12-19 In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg celebrated his inauguration by holding a traditional reception at the former Tweed Courthouse. Four years later, it was a splashier affair at a bank near City Hall, with thousands of doughnuts and cupcakes, all paid for by him, as well as a performance by Liza Minnelli. But this time, the billionaire mayor is having none of that.

Mr. Bloomberg has decided to scrap the traditional ceremony after his inaugural address on New Year’s Day, according to city officials briefed on the plans. Instead, he plans to spend the day participating in public service projects across the city to help promote his N.Y.C. Service initiative. One of his projects, for instance, will be putting together care packages at Staten Island Borough Hall for local troops stationed abroad.

The mayor’s office declined to comment on his plans. But city officials close to the administration said that Mr. Bloomberg was cognizant that any kind of an inaugural gala would seem excessive or out of place during a time of economic anxiety, in a city struggling with double-digit unemployment and facing extensive cuts in subway service.

Mr. Bloomberg, the wealthiest person in the city, just spent more than $100 million to win a third term by a margin that was smaller than had been anticipated. And part of the reason that margin was smaller, political analysts say, is that a sizable portion of New Yorkers felt that the mayor had not been responsive to their complaints about middle-class pocketbook issues, like higher taxes and parking fees.

Mr. Bloomberg spent a total of more than $4 million on his first two inaugural celebrations, which featured comfort foods like mini-hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, apple cider and beer.
722 2009-12-19 “From now on, industries will not only care about making money,” said Mr. Srisuwan, who comes from a family of rice farmers. “They have to care about the environment and the well-being of the people in the community.”

Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem.

The injunction stopped new projects, but older, heavily polluting plants were allowed to carry on. The rulings require the government to write a new set of environmental laws. But what Thailand needs, experts say, is not new laws but better enforcement of existing ones.

“In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all,” said Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant. “Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution — you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you.”

Reports detailing how unhealthy this area is for those who live and work in the shadow of the refineries, plastics factories and other petrochemical facilities here have stacked up over the years.

Thailand’s National Cancer Institute found in 2003 that rates of cervical, bladder, breast, liver, nasal, stomach, throat and blood cancers were highest in Rayong Province, where Map Ta Phut and other industrial zones are located. A study led by Italian researchers and released in 2007 found that people living near Map Ta Phut had 65 percent higher levels of genetic damage to blood cells than people in the same province who lived in rural areas. Such cell damage, which is a possible precursor to cancer, was 120 percent higher for refinery workers than for residents of Rayong Province’s rural communities.

Marco Peluso, the lead author of the study, said it would be rare to see these levels of genetic damage in the West.

The main problem appears to be air pollution. The Thai pollution control department reported in September that it had found nine types of carcinogenic compounds in the air around Map Ta Phut.

In March, an initial court decision from the lawsuit by the 27 villagers declared Map Ta Phut a “pollution control zone,” obliging the authorities to measure soil and water quality regularly and to come up with a plan to reduce pollution if it is too high.

But the real sting for companies came in September, when another court ruled in a related lawsuit that 76 projects, most of them under construction, should immediately stop work because they were not in compliance with environmental provisions in the country’s new Constitution. The decision was upheld by a higher court early this month for all but 11 of the projects.

Among the companies affected are Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant; Aditya Birla Chemicals, an Indian conglomerate; BlueScope Steel of Australia; and two dozen companies belonging to P.T.T., the Thai energy giant.

Lawyers for the companies say the most galling aspect of the injunction is that they could not possibly comply with the law because detailed regulations have yet to be written, a problem that the government acknowledges.

The generals who carried out Thailand’s 2006 military coup promulgated a new Constitution that strengthened environmental law, requiring detailed studies before the approval of any project that causes “serious impact” to the environment or people’s health.

But “serious” was never defined, and specific guidelines for companies were never drawn up, partly because government officials had been distracted by Thailand’s continuing political turmoil.

“Right now, companies don’t know which way to turn,” said Sivapong Viriyabusaya, a partner in Bangkok at the law firm Baker & McKenzie, which is representing companies affected by the injunction. “They want to comply, but they cannot because there are no rules.”

Mr. Srisuwan, the lawyer who won the injunction, is unapologetic about the potential economic effects of the decision. “I don’t care about investors,” he said. “I don’t care about losing employment and the economy. I just care that people’s lives will be protected.”

The frustration is echoed by Noi Jaitang, a 70-year-old fruit farmer. Over the past two decades, Mr. Noi says, he has lost six members of his family to cancer. Now his wife has a cancerous tumor below her left eye. In October, Mr. Noi walked barefoot to Bangkok — about 125 miles away — to protest the pollution, which he blames for the deaths.

“It’s not that I want to burn the factories down,” he said. “We just want to be able to live together.”

The government says it is moving as quickly as it can to pass the requisite laws that will allow the injunction to be lifted. But Mr. Srisuwan calls this lawsuit only the “tip of the iceberg.”

There are 181 other factories in Thailand that are not complying with the new Constitution, including paper, steel and petroleum companies, he says. “I will file lawsuits against all of them,” Mr. Srisuwan said.

727 2009-12-20 “I understand the situation that Nate is in the last year and he has to play,” Walsh said in a telephone interview, “so if that’s the option that he wants to pursue, I told him I’ll talk about it.”

Walsh said he wanted to see “if this can be straightened out” before deciding whether to pursue a trade. But it appears that D’Antoni has no intention of playing Robinson again. He left him on the bench Thursday and Friday, despite the absence of Larry Hughes, who was resting a strained groin muscle.

Robinson, a potent scorer, has remained idle even on nights when the Knicks have struggled to make a basket — as they did in the second half against Chicago on Thursday and the first half against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday. The Knicks lost to the Bulls but beat the Clippers.

“They were 4 of 23 in the third quarter,” Goodwin said, referring to the Chicago game, “and when you lose a big lead and you’re shooting that bad in one quarter, and he didn’t even look at Nate Robinson, I called Donnie Walsh. Because I realized at that point he had no intention of playing Nate again.”

Robinson has even slipped behind two marginal players — Eddy Curry, who has struggled with conditioning and injuries; and Jonathan Bender, who just joined the Knicks last week and had not played since 2005. Bender played 14 minutes Friday night, and Robinson stayed on the bench for the eighth straight game.

Goodwin called the decision to play Bender instead of Robinson, “pretty ridiculous” and indicative of D’Antoni’s stance toward Robinson.

D’Antoni did not immediately return a call seeking comment. He has not hidden his frustration with Robinson’s immaturity and impulsiveness, although he has never cited those factors in the benching.

Goodwin said that Robinson has “done everything that he’s been asked,” to no avail. The Knicks have gone 5-3 since Robinson was dropped from the rotation.

When he first benched Robinson three weeks ago, D’Antoni said he wanted to give more playing time to the rookie Toney Douglas, whose defense he praised. But Douglas has gradually slipped out of the regular rotation as well.

Goodwin, who has had a client on the Knicks’ roster for the last eight years, stressed that he had no ill feelings toward Walsh or team ownership. He compared the situation to the impasse between D’Antoni and Stephon Marbury last year, which ended when Marbury was banished and then waived.

“I think it’s more than clear to anyone involved, including Donnie, that this has nothing to do with Nate Robinson as a basketball player,” Goodwin said. “Donnie and I need to work together to get Nate out of there as quickly as possible.”
728 2009-12-20 After landing in a Washington-area snowstorm and retiring for a few hours of rest, Mr. Obama appeared in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on a snowy Saturday. He called the health care deal “a major step forward” and the climate change agreement an “important breakthrough.”

Still, he acknowledged that neither was exactly what he had set out to achieve. On climate change, he said that the Copenhagen pact “is not enough” and that “we have a long way to go.” On health care, he noted that “as with any legislation, compromise is part of the process.”

In an interview, Mr. Emanuel said the developments showed that Mr. Obama “sets out the North Stars for us” in terms of broad and ambitious goals, but is willing to let his staff and allies haggle over the specifics. “He doesn’t negotiate the ends,” Mr. Emanuel said. “He’s very open to discussing alternative routes.”

Critics cautioned against making too much of the agreements. “They are pyrrhic victories,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former Capitol Hill aide. “Neither deal will necessarily improve his poll ratings with swing voters, nor will they energize his base. And neither take the necessary steps to put the American economy back on track, which should be the only thing he is thinking about right now.”

The climate deal in particular may seem more than it is. With the Copenhagen conference unable to agree on binding limits on greenhouse gases linked to climate change, Mr. Obama settled for a three-page agreement with no short or midterm goals but a long-term commitment to prevent world temperatures from rising by more than two degrees by midcentury.

The health care legislation is much further along, and while it compromised on abortion and abandoned a government-run health plan, it still includes many changes long favored by Democrats. If it passes the Senate this week as now appears probable, it stands a much better chance of actually becoming law, culminating decades of largely failed efforts to revamp the nation’s health care system.

Mr. Obama has put a high value on process and keeping things moving, recognizing that history generally does not remember the to and fro, only the big sweep of presidential accomplishments. He may not get the health care plan he envisioned but, if the legislation passes, he will insure 30 million more people, stop insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and at least try to rein in costs. He will not end climate change in his presidency, and may not get the market-based emission caps he wants, but he may move the country, and the world, toward meaningful action.

Of course, to many on both sides of the aisle, there is a less sympathetic narrative. To the left, Mr. Obama seems increasingly to lack the fire to fight on matters of principle. To the right, he appears to be overreaching, saddling the country with debt and the weight of a bloated and overly intrusive government.

Yet whatever their merits, coming at the end of a tough first year, the developments of the past couple of days were something of a balm for the Obama White House. Little this year has come as easily as Mr. Obama and his team once imagined, but as they sort through the balance sheet, they argue that the mediocre poll ratings do not reflect the record.

Mr. Emanuel noted that a year ago, the economy was on the brink of a depression and the financial and auto industries were near collapse. Today, the economy is growing again, and banks and one of the large car companies are repaying government bailouts, although unemployment remains perilously high and the national debt is soaring.

He also ticked off a series of legislative measures that passed with little notice — an expansion of health care for lower-income children, new regulations on the tobacco and credit card industries and an overhaul of military acquisition. With health care now looking closer to passage, Mr. Emanuel called it the “most significant legislative first year of a first-term president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.”

Even so, White House officials are frustrated at the difficulties they have had. As they talk about their agenda for 2010, some Democrats have suggested looking for a few easy, popular initiatives as sort of a breather between the big-ticket, often polarizing proposals that dominated 2009.

The problem, as they noted, is that they had expected some of this year’s proposals to be more popular, only to discover otherwise in a treacherous political climate.
729 2009-12-20 No one is in charge these days at the Federal Election Commission, the agency that is supposed to enforce campaign law. Repeated stalemates engineered by Republican members raise the potential for runaway abuses in next year’s Congressional elections.

The six-member commission, shared evenly by the two parties, needs a majority for any enforcement action. For months, Republican members have cynically withheld their votes, rejecting staff investigators’ sound recommendations for citations and fines in current cases of obvious abuse. They seem to have completely forgotten why they are there: they are supposed to be enforcing the law, not sabotaging it.

The F.E.C. was hardly ever a paragon of effective enforcement, weighted as it has been with appointees favoring their party machines’ fondness for easy campaign money. But the latest Republican members are blazing a Paleolithic path of regression.

In the latest example, they neutralized long-standing restrictions on a candidate’s use of funds from family members to keep a campaign afloat. Staff specialists found a “knowing and willful” violation by a candidate boosted with $75,000 of his mother’s money. There is plenty of precedent for the finding, but Republicans contended the regulation was suddenly too unclear to be enforced. Democratic members properly disputed this but were powerless to act without the requisite votes.

Call it the Pax Republicana for the approaching political battleground. Other Republican-engineered stalemates led to the voiding of a conciliatory agreement accepted by an accused offender. Penalties for an admitted campaign-fund bilker were also dropped, and the commission returned the penalty check of another offender.

As the commission shambles toward the 2010 elections, President Obama must fulfill his 2008 campaign commitment and begin filling the panel with new, truly independent experts. He has that power, if he is willing to buck Congress’s historic preference for party hacks.
730 2009-12-20 Alexis Amann and Jonathan Burstein’s “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” at 986 Market Street, is a wonderful example of storefront art. This duo’s luminous, marine-hued installation depicting an underwater landscape — complete with sharks, seaweed and a newspaper-reading deep-sea diver — playfully stands out against the strip clubs, boarded-up facades and 24-hour doughnut shops of Central Market.

The cardboard-cutout montage has a children’s comic-book feel. But on closer inspection, the piece has a satirical, dystopian edge more akin to the work of Art Spiegelman or the local graphic novelist Jon Adams than to Richard Scarry. The diver’s newspaper carries the headline “Homeowners Underwater! Tsunami of Foreclosures”; miniature human heads bob forlornly atop seaweed strands; and a menacing shark has the word “loans” painted on its side.

Although delivered with humor, the message is clear: the Central Market neighborhood is underwater, and locals must fight to stay afloat.

Chris Treggiari and Billy Mitchell’s installation at 144 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin has a similarly powerful neighborhood connection and strong visual appeal. Unlike the other projects around town, their work, “Fight for Your Neighborhood,” stands in front of a derelict restaurant — a shuttered facade that once belonged to the San Francisco institution Original Joe’s — rather than behind the safety of glass.

This colorful, street-level artwork, with its painted prizefighter and wooden boxing ring surrounded by posters of local residents with their fists raised, pays homage to the neighborhood’s boxing history. It also physically mimics the challenges facing the area as it fights for survival in a depressed economy.

Mr. Treggiari said his artwork had been vandalized a few times. (When I recently visited, a piece of wood had been torn off and thrown into the boxing ring.) But residents have reportedly rallied around the installation.

“The neighborhood has truly taken ownership over the project,” Mr. Treggiari said. “I’ve recently received reports from friends who have seen paintings left by my piece. I hope it continues to inspire creativity within the community, because this is really what it’s all about.”

Just as this artwork mutates over time, the other San Francisco installations (as well as similar storefront projects in cities as diverse as New York, London and Cape Girardeau, Mo.) face change — and ultimately eviction.

According to Daniel Hurtado, executive director of the Central Market Community Benefit District, planned retail projects in the area will soon force out two artworks. And in the Tenderloin, Elvin Padilla, executive director of the Tenderloin Economic Development Project, expects the Original Joe’s site to be developed in 2010.

The Art in Storefronts project is undeniably laudable from a social and cultural standpoint. Both residents and artists are benefiting. Christopher Simmons, one of the creators of the work “Everything Is O.K.,” at 998 Market Street, said that he had had an increase in visitors to his Facebook page since the unveiling of his installation, and that he was in talks with galleries about future commissions.

It’s great that San Francisco is taking an art-forward stance during the recession. Care, however, should be taken to preserve these artworks and prevent commerce from dictating all the rules. Let’s hope that the city continues to support local artists when its “storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light” — as Allen Ginsberg irreverently depicts the urban metropolis in “Howl” — once again ring with the sound of jangling cash registers.
731 2009-12-20 BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The European Union opened its borders to more than 10 million Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians on Saturday after nearly 20 years of demanding visas, a major advance for closer ties with the 27-nation bloc.

All three western Balkan nations celebrated the lifting of visas with fireworks, concerts and all-night festivities, recognizing a significant milestone for citizens who have long felt shunned by the rest of Europe.

“We should all remember this day,” said Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic of Serbia. “Finally, the same rules that apply for others apply for us as well.”

The Montenegrin prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, described the move as “the happiest news this year.” But Mr. Djukanovic also warned that “hard work lies ahead” before the tiny nation could fulfill its goal of becoming a European Union member.

In the Macedonian capital, Skopje, a huge countdown clock was posted at a central square where thousands attended a concert with D.J.’s and pop singers. At midnight, Champagne corks popped in a toast to the end of what many in the region thought was a humiliation.
732 2009-12-20 Since 2000, the cost of heating a home with has more than doubled and the cost of heating a home with electricity has risen by one third, outpacing many incomes. The recent surge in unemployment has thrown even more people into energy debt.

Last winter, applications for federal energy assistance soared and Congress nearly doubled money for the program, known as Liheap, to $5.1 billion. In 2009, a record 8.1 million households, up from 6.1 million in 2008, received one-time grants, averaging about $500, according to data released Friday by the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Congress kept the financing at $5.1 billion for the coming year. Energy prices have dipped slightly, but applications this fall are up an additional 20 percent, so grants will shrink or more people will be turned down, the association said.

“Households will do just about anything to stay connected,” said John Howat, an analyst with the National Consumer Law Center in . If they cannot pay, some people move and open a new account under a different name. Some run extension cords from a neighbor’s house, others spend weeks getting heat from dangerous stoves and light from candles.

The Cardentes got their power turned back on by borrowing money from relatives and paying $3,500 toward arrears of more than $10,000. But they defaulted on a plan that called for them to pay $723 each month, and the utility demanded the balance of almost $5,000. They are applying for Liheap aid and plan to appeal to the utility for more time.

For some low-income families, the federal grants have been welcome but just too small. Suzette Orazi, 50, and her husband, Juan Lizardo, 45, live with a teenage son in a house in that is heated inefficiently with electric room units. As energy prices climbed over the last several years, so did their utility bills, while Mr. Lizardo lost his job as a jewel polisher.

The $1,000 they got from Liheap last winter hardly made a dent in their growing arrears, now over $11,000. The power company recently threatened to cut them off but later said that in accord with state protections for low-income customers, it would not do so in winter. It is still pressing for an immediate $2,456, however.

“We just can’t make that payment,” said Ms. Orazi, who receives disability. The couple fears losing the house as well as the electricity needed to live in it.

, like Rhode Island, requires lower electric rates for low-income consumers. Even so, as unemployment in California climbed past 12 percent, the number of shutoffs among such families rose by one-fifth in the year that ended in August, according to a report last month by the state’s Division of Ratepayer Advocates.

In , the number of shutoffs for all incomes rose from 86,074 in 2008 to 105,300 in just the first nine months of 2009, according to the state’s Public Utilities Commission.

is widely praised for its program for low-income residents: a family of four making less than $38,588 pays only about 6 percent of its income on utilities. Those one step up, with incomes up to $49,612 for a family of four, are eligible for Liheap grants.

But many families just above that level, with incomes between $50,000 and $66,000, have found themselves in energy trouble in a high-cost state where unemployment is 9.7 percent. New Jersey Shares, a nonprofit organization that provides up to $1,000 in energy assistance to that group, has already helped a record 19,000 families this fall and turned away an additional 18,000 for lack of money, said its director, James M. Jacob. Many seeking aid are facing imminent shutoffs, he said.

With energy costs becoming a chronic challenge, consumer advocates in Rhode Island and elsewhere are pushing for alternatives to one-time grants, citing the program in New Jersey and a similar one adopted this year in , setting bills as a share of income.

Such an approach would make a world of difference for the Cardente family, for example; in hard times, their bills would have been cut, and when Ms. Cardente and her husband find work, the bills would rise.

already has income-linked subsidies, but in mid-December, citing rising hardship, the governor and legislative leaders said they would rush through a bill for still more aid. , , and are among states that reduce utility bills according to income levels, said Mr. Howat, the consumer advocate.

The subsidies are usually paid for by raising rates for household, commercial and industrial customers, posing political risks. In Rhode Island, a bill to cap utility bills for the poor at 6 percent of income has been introduced by State Representative Arthur Handy, Democrat of Cranston. But in a statement last June, the state’s Division of Public Utilities and Carriers expressed “reservations” about the proposal, and its prospects remain uncertain.

James E. Lanni, the state’s associate administrator of utilities, said the plan would place an unreasonable burden on consumers, raising the average electric bill by 3.7 percent and the average gas bill by 5 percent to yield $15.2 million in subsidies. He said that the doubling of federal energy aid, along with other programs, had reduced need and that if fees were not linked to consumption, people would have no incentive to conserve energy.

In an interview, Mr. Handy countered that with his plan, utilities would save money on dealing with delinquent accounts and spend less money disconnecting and reconnecting homes.

The Rhode Island legislature is expected to consider the measure early next year.
733 2009-12-20 With Messi down either wing, with Xavi picking out passes as if by the instinct of a homing pigeon, with Andrés Iniesta and Thierry Henry, and now with Zlatan Ibrahimovic replacing Samuel Eto’o as the focal point of attack, it has a style so easy on the eye, yet also so competitive.

Madrid has support from the Spanish institutions prepared to help it pay more than its means to try to ensure that Barcelona does not keep running away with all the prizes. Madrid’s policy was to buy — not just Ronaldo, but also Kaká, Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso and others in a single summer.

What it cannot buy is the roots of Barca’s beauty, its renowned style. That is a product of La Masia, the school built on an 18th century farm in the lea of the club’s Camp Nou stadium.

“The player who has passed through La Masia has something different to the rest,” Coach Josep Guardiola said. “It’s a plus that comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child.”

Guardiola knows, because he passed through the school and played for the first team for a decade before graduating to be its coach. One of his players, the meticulous Xavi, has just played his 500th senior game in the shirt.

Xavi is a born and bred Catalan, a child and now a man of F.C. Barcelona. But though Messi was born abroad, Txiki Begiristain, the club’s technical director, insists, “Mess’s from Argentina, but he was formed in our house.” Indeed he was, from age 13.

That raises the conundrum of 2009. Messi scored the winning goal in extra time Saturday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, as Barcelona defeated Estudiantes de la Plata of Argentina, 2-1. He was the star of stars wherever Barcelona performed, yet he could barely shine for his homeland. He could look like a boy indulging in a great fantasy even in the Champions League final in Rome, but he shrank whenever he pulled on the blue and white stripes of Argentina.

The reason must be Diego Maradona. Once the greatest star of Argentina — and, incidentally, of Barcelona for a time — Maradona took his national squad to the brink of lunacy in his first year of attempted team management. A novice coach, inconsistent and unwilling to listen to advice, he never picked the same lineup twice and came within a hair’s breadth of failing to reach the World Cup.

César Menotti, the coach of Argentina’s 1978 World Cup-winning side, spelled it out in two sentences: “Argentina does not have a functioning team. Messi is not responsible for the strategy at Barcelona, he is the one that completes the moves.”

The star, yes, but the star of a fantastically integrated team.

Europe’s best national side, Spain, is also an integration — of Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla. Another interpretation of integration arose significantly during the year. We saw it in the German side that won the European under-21 championship in Sweden, and saw it again in the Swiss youths who became world under-17 champions in Nigeria.

More than half the Germany squad and more than half of Switzerland’s emerging talents were born abroad or are the sons of immigrants. This cosmopolitan makeup, still unusual but perfectly legitimate, is a measure of sports reflecting the shifting patterns of population movement.

The Balkans conflict, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the migration of Africans and the fact that some soccer players settle in countries where their skills took them are changing the gene pool of international sports — not simply of soccer.

The youth successes of today may well mature into the pattern of tomorrow. And if soccer maintains its global aspect — especially if FIFA allows players of dual nationality to choose for which country they play — the trend seen in Germany and Switzerland could become a template.

Soccer, however, struggles to close its doors to another international trend: corruption. Police officers in Central Europe are starting to unravel match-fixing scams, some of them initiated in Asia. FIFA ended 2009 by calling in Interpol to try to track down the gang leaders who are suspected of manipulating the spread of on-line betting.

The year ends with suspicion and arrests, but thus far no trials.

Meanwhile, a World Cup beckons. It is shaping up to be a tournament of dirty hands and clean shoes. The blatant hand ball of Henry, which helped give France a place at the World Cup in South Africa, contrasts with the delightful tale of Slovenia.

Borut Pahor, the Slovene prime minister, vowed that he would clean the players’ shoes if Slovenia, population two million, knocked out Russia, population 142 million, in qualification. It did in November, and the prime minister kept his promise.
734 2009-12-20 It was a week to think about Wall Street and money — who makes it and who takes it — as the vault door closed on the era of the Big Bailout. The same week President Obama chided “fat cat bankers” for raising their pay in tough times, the last of the big banks to take bailout money said they were moving to repay billions that had propped them up — and free themselves of the restrictions on pay that came with the money. Perhaps no moment better captured the shift in power from Washington, where it had tilted during the dark days of last autumn, back to its historic center. After the meltdown, many had hoped policy makers would rewrite the rules for the financial industry. Now, nearly all of the biggest banks have wiggled out from under Uncle Sam’s thumb. The crisis is over, the profits are piling up, and Washington can no longer call the shots on banker pay.
735 2009-12-20 THE longest-running lie I tell on the holidays is: “I can’t be there on (Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year’s, fill in the blank). I am flying that day.”

The thing about this lie is that I have willed it to be true. I have such a loathing of New Year’s Eve, for instance, that I have contrived to be on an overseas American Airlines flight at the stroke of midnight for the last six years. (The more humane pilots wish you a happy New Year over the intercom.)

This “lie” has become a great source of comfort to me over the years. Flying on Christmas Day, for example, is a good way to avoid lemminglike airport scenes, not to mention the tense moment when one’s mother makes the annual presentation of the boxer shorts and the blue merino dress socks.

I get a private viewing of the socks and underwear box if I arrive late. It certainly makes commentary about this year’s clever new J. Crew patterns much easier if the audience is limited.

The year my “fly by lie” plan became an unintentional epic was when I told everyone my flight to Los Angeles would arrive late at night, a few minutes into Boxing Day. In fact, I took off from Kennedy airport at 7 a.m. on Christmas and arrived in Los Angeles by noon, as always.

I love Los Angeles, my hometown, at Christmastime. The juxtaposition of tacky street decorations with leafy green trees and incessant “Little Drummer Boy” Muzak puts me in a kind of Didion-themed trance, sans Quaaludes. I had contrived to take Christmas as a sort of personal day — yes, spurning my family for a marathon afternoon and evening of movies with friends.
736 2009-12-20 “It would never even occur to me not to use an agent,” he said. “But I’m a restoration architect. I live in the past.”

Are real estate brokers — like travel agents and other middlemen coping with the increasingly digital culture — in danger of becoming expensive anachronisms?

After all, it is only logical that as people feel more empowered based on their access to information and their ability to connect without help, they are at least questioning the wisdom of the conventional way of buying and selling a home.

According to the , the percentage of homes sold nationally by their owners has actually declined, from 14 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2009. But Real Trends, a company that monitors the residential brokerage industry, considers those findings to be low, and estimates that the number of for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, homes was almost one in five three years ago, when it stopped tracking them.

“I’ve been in this business for 33 years and I’ve always wondered why more people didn’t say, ‘I’m going to take a shot at this myself,’ ” said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends’ reports. “Now, with the technology available, that would seem to be inevitable. We tracked FSBO numbers through 2006 — before the market collapsed — and we were already seeing substantial differences between the attitudes and habits of people under 35 and those over 50.”

Younger people, he said, are far more likely to embrace the multitasking and risk taking involved in selling their own homes. If the decision to use an agent is becoming generational as well as situational, that would not augur well for real estate agents.

“This is going to sound bad, but I just don’t give a lot of credence to what brokers do,” said Cynthia LeStar, who is selling her studio apartment on the Upper East Side. “I mean, what do they do that I can’t do on my own?”

Ms. LeStar, 30, moved to New York from on Sept. 9, 2001, and was on a PATH train to the World Trade Center station from Hoboken for an interview with on the morning of Sept. 11. Despite her parents’ pleas to come home, she took the job and, after a few years, decided to buy instead of rent. But she was laid off last spring, and recently concluded that she could no longer carry her studio while changing careers — to acting.

Ms. LeStar consulted for comparable neighborhood sales and settled on an asking price of $444,000. She placed an ad on and expanded her search for buyers by gaining access to ASmallWorld, a private international online community that she likened to a celebrity . Marketing her apartment has cost her nothing.

Ms. LeStar’s background in finance made her comfortable in representing herself. “Even when I was buying, I would have preferred cutting out the middleman,” she said. “I felt out of the loop. I love negotiating.”

Like Ms. LeStar, Ms. Corvino, 35, was undaunted by the prospect of catering to potential buyers. She says that she has not seen any appreciable difference in the amount of traffic now that she is in charge.

Ms. Corvino bought the house hoping to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast. But when the economy tanked, she needed the income from renting all four units.

"Selling in this market is difficult, because it takes a special person to buy a large home like this one,” she said. “Not to mention that right now it’s a rental property."

To appear more businesslike, she hired a graphic artist to produce a sign that “didn’t look like those chintzy red ones that say For Sale By Owner.”

Ms. Corvino also created a Web site for the 4,600-square-foot house, 46Voorhis.com, where she posted 43 color photos taken by a professional photographer. She placed ads at craigslist.com and loopnet.com, a commercial real estate site. A sales manager for a wine wholesaler and importer, Ms. Corvino monitors responses via her mobile phone and has been able to break away from her job to show the house.

Factoring in the minimal cost of open houses, she estimates that she has spent $1,000 thus far, a far cry from the $40,000 to $50,000 broker’s fee that she would have to pay if she sold for near her asking price.

“I think if you go about it the right way, you don’t need an agent,” Ms. Corvino said. “But that’s if you can take all the calls, answer all the e-mails and be at the house at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.”

Next door, Mr. Hall said he and his wife, who works in the Nyack school district, do not have the time, inclination or technical expertise to sell their own house.

“I wouldn’t call myself Internet savvy,” said Mr. Hall, 55. “I don’t have an . I wouldn’t know what avenues to use. I also think the personal touch is important, though the younger generation probably feels that Facebook is a human relationship.”

When the Halls decided to sell their house last July, there was no question that they would list it with Suzanne Blaisdell Grant of Wright Bros. Real Estate in Nyack. Mr. Hall has served on town boards with Mrs. Grant’s husband and considers them old friends.

Mrs. Grant cited her longstanding relationship with the Halls as a prime example of why real estate brokers are not endangered and why what they do cannot be compared to selling a stock or booking a vacation.

“I can understand why people would say, ‘Why would I pay someone to sell my house? It’s a lovely house. I’ll just put a sign out,’ ” Mrs. Grant said.

“But it’s so much more than that, much more than selling a stock or buying a car on . It’s being honest with the seller in staging the house, getting it ready. It’s giving the seller distance, because people who are emotionally involved in a purchase or sale of something as big and life-shaping as a home aren’t necessarily in the best position to be objective.”

Jennifer Juergens of and her four brothers and two sisters came to that conclusion after their mother died in 2007 and they put her Tudor-style house in Larchmont up for sale.

“It needed some work, but the market at the time was strong and Larchmont is a very desirable town,” said Ms. Juergens, 48, a former magazine editor who now works in public relations. “My brother said he thought we didn’t need a broker, we could sell it by ourselves. So we put an ad on Craigslist and listed it for $1 million. The first guy that came to see it with his wife, before it was even cleaned up, told my brother John, ‘Oh, we love it; we’ll give you $1 million.’

“But,” Ms. Juergens continued, “he also wanted his father to see it. The dad came over and said, ‘We’re going to start with the asking price and work our way down.’ They went room to room and he kept saying, ‘Well, this needs replacing, this is old, this isn’t good.’ Everything negative. This was the house we’d grown up in. Our mother had just died. Emotions were high. My brother got so upset he just asked them to leave.”

Now supporting Mrs. Grant’s contention that there is no better buffer than a broker, the family hired Keller Williams Realty of Scarsdale and embarked upon a cleanup plan. The house is listed at $899,000.

Linda West Eckhardt, an author of cookbooks, has her Dutch colonial in Maplewood, N.J., on the market for $345,000. She has sold homes in , and , and is firmly in the get-an-agent camp — with a caveat.

Having worked with agents who were “indifferent, incompetent and otherwise disappointing,” she said, “I feel about real estate agents the way I feel about literary agents — those areas are filled with peril.” But, she added, “I believe they’ll get you more than enough to make up for their fee.”

So Ms. West Eckhardt’s advice is to “interview, interview, interview” brokers. But this time around, serendipity played a role in her selection. At a party in Maplewood, she met Joanne Douds, who works for International Realty in Fort Lee, N.J.

“She says the hard things to me, like ‘Your house smells like dogs,’ ” Ms. West Eckhardt said. “On the day of the open house, she walked in with her makeup and eyelashes six inches in front of her face and Prada shoes, took one look at what I considered neat and clean, rolled up her sleeves and said, ‘Get me the vacuum cleaner.’ ”

Ms. West Eckhardt said that at 70, she is more eager to churn out several more books than to spend time extolling the Maplewood-South Orange school district to a trail of bright-eyed couples.

But as Ms. LeStar has discovered while showing her Upper East Side studio, there is not that much extolling to do. “The buyers walk in and they know as much about the apartment as you do,” she said.

Technology has made it much easier for people to educate themselves, a trend that agents have had to acknowledge and adjust to.

“It’s not like it was 10 years ago, where you might show someone eight houses in a day,” said Russ Woolley, the president of Wright Bros. Real Estate. “They have already been online and know what they like and don’t like. They may have seen 20 pictures of one house.” Potential buyers, he said, now arrive with specific houses in mind.

Dan Murray, a firefighter in the South Bronx, is hedging his bets and working both ends of the real estate equation.

To market their three-bedroom condominium in Riverdale, Mr. Murray and his wife, Diana, placed ads online and paid a one-time fee of $300 to forsalebyowner.com, which placed the property with the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listings Service.

Mr. Murray, 40, is prepared to pay the agent who delivers a buyer 2 percent of the selling price, substantially less than the standard industry fee of 5 percent to 6 percent.

Meanwhile, in his search for a new home in northern Westchester County, he is using maps and satellite photos, while scouring the same sites he is advertising on for a FSBO.

“I would think anyone who is comfortable with the Internet would prefer to do it this way,” Mr. Murray said. “Eventually, who won’t be?”
737 2009-12-20 IT was, readers of The New York Times recently learned, a very good year for Paramount Pictures. Two of the year’s biggest hits, “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra” and “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” have helped the studio climb out of its financial hole with a combined domestic take of more than $500 million. Both movies are deeply stupid, often incoherent and hinged on the principle that the spectacle of violence is its own pleasurable end. “Transformers” is also casually racist. But hey, that’s entertainment.

Or, more specifically, that’s Hollywood entertainment in the conglomerate age. The major studios have long been in the business of serving sludge to the world, but now the reek often spreads around the globe simultaneously with massive coordinated openings. “Revenge of the Fallen,” for instance, opened the same day on more than 4,000 screens in the United States — about a 10th of all the screens in the country — and soon about 10,000 more abroad. “Angels & Demons,” the sequel to “The Da Vinci Code,” opened on some 3,500 screens domestically and ate up more than 10,000 internationally. The French film “Summer Hours,” meanwhile, the best-reviewed release in The Times that weekend, opened on two screens.

The question of consumer choice becomes all but moot when the Top 5 box office movies are playing on more than one-quarter of all the screens in America, as was the case during the first weekend of May, when “Star Trek” opened. That weekend 10 movies dominated 67 percent of the country’s screens. Three of those titles were released by Paramount. Warner Brothers and Disney had two movies each; 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and the independent company Summit Entertainment each had one. (It’s worth noting that National Amusements, the company that has a controlling stake in Viacom, the entertainment conglomerate that in turn runs Paramount, owns more than 1,500 screens around the world.)

The problem isn’t blockbusters per se or certain kinds of genre movies or inflated budgets: “Star Trek,” wittily directed by J. J. Abrams, is an entertaining rethink of a defining science-fiction brand, and the even pricier “Avatar,” from James Cameron, is in a class by itself. But these remain exceptions to the flashier, noisier, dumber rule of much of today’s mega-budget entertainment. Movies have always been segmented among different audiences, but the disparity between the work that earns most of the critical love at release — and awards — time and much of what fills the multiplex on a weekly basis seems greater than ever. Paramount sells the audience “G. I. Joe” and sells Oscar voters (and critics) “Up in the Air.”

That divide between the studios’ bulk product and their prestige items has become even more conspicuous because so many specialty units have been closed, absorbed or downsized in the last two years, leaving executives with fewer reasons to go to the Oscars. (Just two years ago Paramount Vantage, the specialty unit of Paramount, released “There Will Be Blood,” one of the finest American movies of the past 50 years. Vantage has since been folded into big Paramount.) A few specialty units remain, however, including Fox Searchlight, which might be why 20th Century Fox feels free to release so many stinkers, including franchise leftovers (“X-Men Origins: Wolverine”) and female-minstrelsy shows (“Bride Wars”). The same holds true over at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which would have been largely an aesthetic wasteland this year without Sony Pictures Classics.
738 2009-12-20 It is one of the great conundrums of modern entertaining: cooking at home for friends whose dietary restrictions do not match your own. The Smiths are wonderful people, funny and kind and smart, exactly the sort to improve a dinner party immensely. Yet they don’t eat meat. (Cue the oat-groats pilaf!) Or they hew to some lunatic Atkins fringe and don’t eat vegetables either. (Steak, no salad, no starch.) A dinner constrained by rules can make your grocery shopping easier. But it’s hardly much fun.

Bobby Flay, the inveterate meat cooker and television-chef raconteur, suggests forging ahead without compromise, simply serving all dinner-party fare on platters, in component parts — vegetables, grains, meats — making sure always to have plenty of flavors in all three. “If you serve your meals family-style,” he said in a telephone interview, “vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike can pick and choose what they like, and no one gets uncomfortable.” The point, his “Iron Chef” colleague Mario Batali added in an e-mail message, is to try “to eliminate the alienation that vegetarians often face in our traditionally protein-heavy meals.”

Here then are two recipes for vegetarians or, just as good, for meat eaters who insist that they don’t eat vegetables. They are wickedly effective on children. Serve them with rice or perhaps with sautéed greens. Both would go nicely with a plate of grilled pork chops or without a meat course altogether. They are deeply, crazily flavorful, as addictive in their way as anything you could order in a Chinese restaurant in a bad part of town, with pork fried rice and a Coke. Yet they leave a body feeling fine and happy, not guilty, bloated and sick.

The first is a take on a classic of Vietnamese restaurants, ca kho, or fish braised in caramel sauce. Mackerel, eel or perch is simmered in the dark and pungent liquid until it goes silky, and the whole is served with chilies and ginger, with rice. Corinne Trang included a recipe for ca kho in her indispensable 1999 cookbook, “Authentic Vietnamese Cooking,” and cheaters like me have tweaked her recipe over the years to accommodate other proteins. (Monkfish, for instance.) Best of all is tofu, firm and rich, which here takes on the character of savory Asian panna cotta, absorbing the velvety sauce and somehow heightening its flavor.

Vietnamese caramel sauce — nuoc mau — is easier to make than you might think, though it can be a dramatic process. In essence what you’re doing is melting sugar in a pan, then allowing it nearly to burn and finally adding water and soy sauce in order to arrest the process at a dark and golden bittersweet flavor that is at the heart of Vietnamese cooking.
739 2009-12-20 Unfortunately, this book is wildly uneven in both its tone and the quality of its writing. The first chapter includes a fanciful account of an actual recent ­McCartney concert, in Liverpool. The whole experience is described as one huge flashback for both Paul and the audience:

“So dry your eyes and blow your nose, because now we’re going back to the basements of our youth. Coming full circle to those sweaty young boys, so full of life and joy and not even suspecting where all of this is about to take them.”

Yes, let’s do that. Our eyes dry in a hurry as we careen from breathless fan-boy writing to dusty travelogue descriptions of Liverpool at the turn of the 20th century, while Carlin describes some immigrants flooding in and others flooding out, “departing for the untrammeled shores of the New World.”

Yawn. Why are shores always untrammeled? No one ever seems to write about how trammeled most shores actually are these days.

What’s missing here is the voice of Paul himself. Being unauthorized, the book suffers from an overabundance of secondhand sources (and the competing flavors of each), and is studded with speculation about what Paul might have said or thought or felt.

In this first chapter alone, which is just 14 pages, Carlin has taken from the following sources: “The Beatles,” by Hun­ter Davies; “The Beatles,” by Bob Spitz; “Liverpool: Wondrous Place,” by Paul Du Noyer; “Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now,” by Barry Miles.

There is only one original interview in the chapter, with Paul’s boyhood acquaintance Tony Bramwell, who, as a constant presence in McCartney’s life, resurfaces at other points in the book. These one-on-one interviews with peripheral characters are actually the strength of this biography, since they shed glimmers of new light on familiar material.

For example, later in the book, Bramwell talks about the EMI record company’s response to “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” now widely considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. McCartney dreamed of turning it into a movie, but according to Bramwell:

“The stingy people at EMI, bless them, the people in charge of the company at the time, actually didn’t think ‘SP’ was a very good album, as such. It had already cost them so much money in the studio, they weren’t sure it was going to recoup anything, so they wouldn’t come up with the budget for the film.”

This is good stuff! Carlin deserves praise for uncovering it, and there are many similar anecdotes in the book.

But much of the writing is jarring, and important things go unexplained. Carlin has tracked down Astrid Kirchherr, the blond existentialist with the black cloth curtain. Nice to think of her again! She tells us that the Beatles were powerful and good-­looking, but we knew that already. Then Carlin continues:

“By now the Beatles had traded their ridiculous lilac jackets for black leather suits, which they wore with black T-shirts. But Astrid saw through the biker gear, and the whiff of violence that permeated the smoky air every night at the Kaiser­keller, and recognized the sweetness and intelligence glimmering just beneath the leather.”

So she sees through the leather outfits, but was she responsible for their cool collar­less suits or not? He doesn’t say. This is not an irrelevant detail. She is also described as an “inspiring photographer” when the context would seem to imply “aspiring photographer.”

Later, Carlin discusses the influence of Brian Epstein, the Beatles’ manager: “No more showing up to play in unwashed leather suits and wrinkled black T-shirts.” Unwashed? How would you wash a leather suit? With a sponge?

The narrative is derailed at times by bizarre random anecdotes. For example, when Paul is courting the actress Jane Asher, whom he dated for years, her father is described as a doctor with a “notorious” sense of humor who “liked to give himself injections at the dinner table, in the back of the neck, when company was at the table.” Huh? Of what? Heroin? Vitamin B-12? Is there even a vein back there? How did he do this himself with no assistance?

Thankfully, Carlin’s tone changes from rapturous and adulatory at the start to cooler and more evenhanded when he’s discussing McCartney’s post-Beatles work with Wings (we learn that Paul was, apparently inadvertently, stingy with raises and royalty payments).

But by the end of the book, Carlin has become judgmental and disapproving. He says McCartney “seems to be enacting a modern version of the legend of Narcissus, too in love with his own youthful reflection to recognize how unappealing his mature face has become.” Yikes. Ouch.

One line about McCartney, which reads like a comment from a rejected suitor, reveals the possible source of this disappointment: “He grants interviews to bloggers and alternative weeklies, even as he turns away some major magazines (and biographers).” Perhaps the author made a bid for his subject’s cooperation but was turned down.

Has Carlin deepened our understanding of McCartney’s character in this book? Or has he only darkened it? He could have written an analysis of that character from an unbiased position, which is what I think he was aiming for. But his attempts to entertain get in the way of the story. And this is an entertaining book, although flawed, filled with complaints and throbbing purple prose. Completists who have a need for every detail on the Beatles will want a copy. It would undoubtedly have been a better book with cooperation from Paul McCartney himself. But maybe not as juicy.
740 2009-12-20 Did you run “A More Perfect Union” to give readers a holiday gift of relief that we aren’t married to those crazy spouses? Or maybe to inspire a New Year’s resolution to work on our own primary relationship and some ideas of how to do so? Beyond those reactions, I was captivated by Elizabeth Weil’s lively, sharp voice, her frank skepticism toward her own behavior as well as hubby’s, and her emotional generosity to both. Thank you for another stimulating, engrossing article.

I loved Elizabeth Weil’s peek into her marriage and her tale of the struggle to improve it. True, it was a bit exhausting and at times uncomfortable to read about her efforts, and phrases like “leave well enough alone” kept creeping into my mind. Such an intimate portrait invites comparisons to your own mate. Personally, I found Dan’s distaste for her visits to her parents a bit overbearing and selfish. I admire, however, his willingness to allow his wife to lay his faults out on the table for us to examine. In the end, I am grateful for my own husband of 28 years.

The way to have a happier marriage is to work at it. In your own time and your own way and certainly not in public. Trying to improve it “now, while it felt strong” reminds me of those who advocate for or choose cosmetic surgery while they are in their 30s, because their skin is more elastic and the effects will last longer.

I think it says something about the inefficacy of the many kinds of therapies that Elizabeth Weil and her husband sought that her moment of clarity, as she gazes at her sleeping husband and feels “more committed than ever,” occurs in the privacy of their home, where it belongs — not on the pages of a magazine.

Elizabeth Weil quoted me in a way that some readers might misinterpret, namely: “If you talk to a therapist in the United States about problems in your marriage, I believe that you stand a good risk of harming your marriage.” I stressed in the interview that the risk comes from inept therapists (of whom there are many, as Weil and her husband experienced first hand), and not that marriage therapy itself should be avoided because it’s inherently dangerous. In the right hands, marriage therapy can transform troubled marriages into healthy ones.

743 2009-12-20 Since 2000, the cost of heating a home with has more than doubled and the cost of heating a home with electricity has risen by one third, outpacing many incomes. The recent surge in unemployment has thrown even more people into energy debt.

Last winter, applications for federal energy assistance soared and Congress nearly doubled money for the program, known as Liheap, to $5.1 billion. In 2009, a record 8.1 million households, up from 6.1 million in 2008, received one-time grants, averaging about $500, according to data released Friday by the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Congress kept the financing at $5.1 billion for the coming year. Energy prices have dipped slightly, but applications this fall are up an additional 20 percent, so grants will shrink or more people will be turned down, the association said.

“Households will do just about anything to stay connected,” said John Howat, an analyst with the National Consumer Law Center in . If they cannot pay, some people move and open a new account under a different name. Some run extension cords from a neighbor’s house, others spend weeks getting heat from dangerous stoves and light from candles.

The Cardentes got their power turned back on by borrowing money from relatives and paying $3,500 toward arrears of more than $10,000. But they defaulted on a plan that called for them to pay $723 each month, and the utility demanded the balance of almost $5,000. They are applying for Liheap aid and plan to appeal to the utility for more time.

For some low-income families, the federal grants have been welcome but just too small. Suzette Orazi, 50, and her husband, Juan Lizardo, 45, live with a teenage son in a house in that is heated inefficiently with electric room units. As energy prices climbed over the last several years, so did their utility bills, while Mr. Lizardo lost his job as a jewel polisher.

The $1,000 they got from Liheap last winter hardly made a dent in their growing arrears, now over $11,000. The power company recently threatened to cut them off but later said that in accord with state protections for low-income customers, it would not do so in winter. It is still pressing for an immediate $2,456, however.

“We just can’t make that payment,” said Ms. Orazi, who receives disability. The couple fears losing the house as well as the electricity needed to live in it.

, like Rhode Island, requires lower electric rates for low-income consumers. Even so, as unemployment in California climbed past 12 percent, the number of shutoffs among such families rose by one-fifth in the year that ended in August, according to a report last month by the state’s Division of Ratepayer Advocates.

In , the number of shutoffs for all incomes rose from 86,074 in 2008 to 105,300 in just the first nine months of 2009, according to the state’s Public Utilities Commission.

is widely praised for its program for low-income residents: a family of four making less than $38,588 pays only about 6 percent of its income on utilities. Those one step up, with incomes up to $49,612 for a family of four, are eligible for Liheap grants.

But many families just above that level, with incomes between $50,000 and $66,000, have found themselves in energy trouble in a high-cost state where unemployment is 9.7 percent. New Jersey Shares, a nonprofit organization that provides up to $1,000 in energy assistance to that group, has already helped a record 19,000 families this fall and turned away an additional 18,000 for lack of money, said its director, James M. Jacob. Many seeking aid are facing imminent shutoffs, he said.

With energy costs becoming a chronic challenge, consumer advocates in Rhode Island and elsewhere are pushing for alternatives to one-time grants, citing the program in New Jersey and a similar one adopted this year in , setting bills as a share of income.

Such an approach would make a world of difference for the Cardente family, for example; in hard times, their bills would have been cut, and when Ms. Cardente and her husband find work, the bills would rise.

already has income-linked subsidies, but in mid-December, citing rising hardship, the governor and legislative leaders said they would rush through a bill for still more aid. , , and are among states that reduce utility bills according to income levels, said Mr. Howat, the consumer advocate.

The subsidies are usually paid for by raising rates for household, commercial and industrial customers, posing political risks. In Rhode Island, a bill to cap utility bills for the poor at 6 percent of income has been introduced by State Representative Arthur Handy, Democrat of Cranston. But in a statement last June, the state’s Division of Public Utilities and Carriers expressed “reservations” about the proposal, and its prospects remain uncertain.

James E. Lanni, the state’s associate administrator of utilities, said the plan would place an unreasonable burden on consumers, raising the average electric bill by 3.7 percent and the average gas bill by 5 percent to yield $15.2 million in subsidies. He said that the doubling of federal energy aid, along with other programs, had reduced need and that if fees were not linked to consumption, people would have no incentive to conserve energy.

In an interview, Mr. Handy countered that with his plan, utilities would save money on dealing with delinquent accounts and spend less money disconnecting and reconnecting homes.

The Rhode Island legislature is expected to consider the measure early next year.
744 2009-12-20 No one is in charge these days at the Federal Election Commission, the agency that is supposed to enforce campaign law. Repeated stalemates engineered by Republican members raise the potential for runaway abuses in next year’s Congressional elections.

The six-member commission, shared evenly by the two parties, needs a majority for any enforcement action. For months, Republican members have cynically withheld their votes, rejecting staff investigators’ sound recommendations for citations and fines in current cases of obvious abuse. They seem to have completely forgotten why they are there: they are supposed to be enforcing the law, not sabotaging it.

The F.E.C. was hardly ever a paragon of effective enforcement, weighted as it has been with appointees favoring their party machines’ fondness for easy campaign money. But the latest Republican members are blazing a Paleolithic path of regression.

In the latest example, they neutralized long-standing restrictions on a candidate’s use of funds from family members to keep a campaign afloat. Staff specialists found a “knowing and willful” violation by a candidate boosted with $75,000 of his mother’s money. There is plenty of precedent for the finding, but Republicans contended the regulation was suddenly too unclear to be enforced. Democratic members properly disputed this but were powerless to act without the requisite votes.

Call it the Pax Republicana for the approaching political battleground. Other Republican-engineered stalemates led to the voiding of a conciliatory agreement accepted by an accused offender. Penalties for an admitted campaign-fund bilker were also dropped, and the commission returned the penalty check of another offender.

As the commission shambles toward the 2010 elections, President Obama must fulfill his 2008 campaign commitment and begin filling the panel with new, truly independent experts. He has that power, if he is willing to buck Congress’s historic preference for party hacks.

746 2009-12-20 BANGKOK — Under pressure from China, and despite the objections of the United States and the United Nations, the Cambodian government on Saturday deported 20 members of the Uighur minority who had sought asylum after fleeing a government crackdown in China.

“They are going back to China,” said an Interior Ministry spokesman, Lt. Gen. Khieu Sopheak. He said the Uighurs had been put on a special plane sent from China that left the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, on Saturday night.

The expulsion came one day before Vice President Xi Jinping of China was due to visit Cambodia. China, which is Cambodia’s biggest investor, had branded the Uighurs criminals and demanded their return.

Earlier, a Cambodian government spokesman, Koy Kuong, said the Uighurs were being expelled because they had entered the country illegally. He said two others who fled with them were missing. “The Cambodian government is implementing its immigration law,” he said. “They came illegally without any passports or visas, so we consider them illegal immigrants.”

The United States and the United Nations have urged Cambodia not to deport the group. “We are deeply disturbed by the reports that the Cambodian government might forcibly return this group of Uighurs without the benefit of a credible refugee status determination process,” said John Johnson, an American Embassy spokesman in Phnom Penh. “The United States strongly urges the Cambodian government to honor its commitments under international law.”

The Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority group whose members say the Chinese government, dominated by ethnic Han, discriminates against them. The 22 fugitives entered Cambodia about a month ago with the aid of Christian missionaries.

In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the Uighurs were under investigation for suspected criminal activities. She said at a news conference and in a written statement to The New York Times on Thursday that criminals should not be allowed to take advantage of the United Nations refugee system. “China’s stance is very clear: the international refugee protection system shouldn’t become a shelter where criminals stay to escape legal punishment,” she said.
747 2009-12-20 “It would never even occur to me not to use an agent,” he said. “But I’m a restoration architect. I live in the past.”

Are real estate brokers — like travel agents and other middlemen coping with the increasingly digital culture — in danger of becoming expensive anachronisms?

After all, it is only logical that as people feel more empowered based on their access to information and their ability to connect without help, they are at least questioning the wisdom of the conventional way of buying and selling a home.

According to the , the percentage of homes sold nationally by their owners has actually declined, from 14 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2009. But Real Trends, a company that monitors the residential brokerage industry, considers those findings to be low, and estimates that the number of for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, homes was almost one in five three years ago, when it stopped tracking them.

“I’ve been in this business for 33 years and I’ve always wondered why more people didn’t say, ‘I’m going to take a shot at this myself,’ ” said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends’ reports. “Now, with the technology available, that would seem to be inevitable. We tracked FSBO numbers through 2006 — before the market collapsed — and we were already seeing substantial differences between the attitudes and habits of people under 35 and those over 50.”

Younger people, he said, are far more likely to embrace the multitasking and risk taking involved in selling their own homes. If the decision to use an agent is becoming generational as well as situational, that would not augur well for real estate agents.

“This is going to sound bad, but I just don’t give a lot of credence to what brokers do,” said Cynthia LeStar, who is selling her studio apartment on the Upper East Side. “I mean, what do they do that I can’t do on my own?”

Ms. LeStar, 30, moved to New York from on Sept. 9, 2001, and was on a PATH train to the World Trade Center station from Hoboken for an interview with on the morning of Sept. 11. Despite her parents’ pleas to come home, she took the job and, after a few years, decided to buy instead of rent. But she was laid off last spring, and recently concluded that she could no longer carry her studio while changing careers — to acting.

Ms. LeStar consulted for comparable neighborhood sales and settled on an asking price of $444,000. She placed an ad on and expanded her search for buyers by gaining access to ASmallWorld, a private international online community that she likened to a celebrity . Marketing her apartment has cost her nothing.

Ms. LeStar’s background in finance made her comfortable in representing herself. “Even when I was buying, I would have preferred cutting out the middleman,” she said. “I felt out of the loop. I love negotiating.”

Like Ms. LeStar, Ms. Corvino, 35, was undaunted by the prospect of catering to potential buyers. She says that she has not seen any appreciable difference in the amount of traffic now that she is in charge.

Ms. Corvino bought the house hoping to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast. But when the economy tanked, she needed the income from renting all four units.

"Selling in this market is difficult, because it takes a special person to buy a large home like this one,” she said. “Not to mention that right now it’s a rental property."

To appear more businesslike, she hired a graphic artist to produce a sign that “didn’t look like those chintzy red ones that say For Sale By Owner.”

Ms. Corvino also created a Web site for the 4,600-square-foot house, 46Voorhis.com, where she posted 43 color photos taken by a professional photographer. She placed ads at craigslist.com and loopnet.com, a commercial real estate site. A sales manager for a wine wholesaler and importer, Ms. Corvino monitors responses via her mobile phone and has been able to break away from her job to show the house.

Factoring in the minimal cost of open houses, she estimates that she has spent $1,000 thus far, a far cry from the $40,000 to $50,000 broker’s fee that she would have to pay if she sold for near her asking price.

“I think if you go about it the right way, you don’t need an agent,” Ms. Corvino said. “But that’s if you can take all the calls, answer all the e-mails and be at the house at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.”

Next door, Mr. Hall said he and his wife, who works in the Nyack school district, do not have the time, inclination or technical expertise to sell their own house.

“I wouldn’t call myself Internet savvy,” said Mr. Hall, 55. “I don’t have an . I wouldn’t know what avenues to use. I also think the personal touch is important, though the younger generation probably feels that Facebook is a human relationship.”

When the Halls decided to sell their house last July, there was no question that they would list it with Suzanne Blaisdell Grant of Wright Bros. Real Estate in Nyack. Mr. Hall has served on town boards with Mrs. Grant’s husband and considers them old friends.

Mrs. Grant cited her longstanding relationship with the Halls as a prime example of why real estate brokers are not endangered and why what they do cannot be compared to selling a stock or booking a vacation.

“I can understand why people would say, ‘Why would I pay someone to sell my house? It’s a lovely house. I’ll just put a sign out,’ ” Mrs. Grant said.

“But it’s so much more than that, much more than selling a stock or buying a car on . It’s being honest with the seller in staging the house, getting it ready. It’s giving the seller distance, because people who are emotionally involved in a purchase or sale of something as big and life-shaping as a home aren’t necessarily in the best position to be objective.”

Jennifer Juergens of and her four brothers and two sisters came to that conclusion after their mother died in 2007 and they put her Tudor-style house in Larchmont up for sale.

“It needed some work, but the market at the time was strong and Larchmont is a very desirable town,” said Ms. Juergens, 48, a former magazine editor who now works in public relations. “My brother said he thought we didn’t need a broker, we could sell it by ourselves. So we put an ad on Craigslist and listed it for $1 million. The first guy that came to see it with his wife, before it was even cleaned up, told my brother John, ‘Oh, we love it; we’ll give you $1 million.’

“But,” Ms. Juergens continued, “he also wanted his father to see it. The dad came over and said, ‘We’re going to start with the asking price and work our way down.’ They went room to room and he kept saying, ‘Well, this needs replacing, this is old, this isn’t good.’ Everything negative. This was the house we’d grown up in. Our mother had just died. Emotions were high. My brother got so upset he just asked them to leave.”

Now supporting Mrs. Grant’s contention that there is no better buffer than a broker, the family hired Keller Williams Realty of Scarsdale and embarked upon a cleanup plan. The house is listed at $899,000.

Linda West Eckhardt, an author of cookbooks, has her Dutch colonial in Maplewood, N.J., on the market for $345,000. She has sold homes in , and , and is firmly in the get-an-agent camp — with a caveat.

Having worked with agents who were “indifferent, incompetent and otherwise disappointing,” she said, “I feel about real estate agents the way I feel about literary agents — those areas are filled with peril.” But, she added, “I believe they’ll get you more than enough to make up for their fee.”

So Ms. West Eckhardt’s advice is to “interview, interview, interview” brokers. But this time around, serendipity played a role in her selection. At a party in Maplewood, she met Joanne Douds, who works for International Realty in Fort Lee, N.J.

“She says the hard things to me, like ‘Your house smells like dogs,’ ” Ms. West Eckhardt said. “On the day of the open house, she walked in with her makeup and eyelashes six inches in front of her face and Prada shoes, took one look at what I considered neat and clean, rolled up her sleeves and said, ‘Get me the vacuum cleaner.’ ”

Ms. West Eckhardt said that at 70, she is more eager to churn out several more books than to spend time extolling the Maplewood-South Orange school district to a trail of bright-eyed couples.

But as Ms. LeStar has discovered while showing her Upper East Side studio, there is not that much extolling to do. “The buyers walk in and they know as much about the apartment as you do,” she said.

Technology has made it much easier for people to educate themselves, a trend that agents have had to acknowledge and adjust to.

“It’s not like it was 10 years ago, where you might show someone eight houses in a day,” said Russ Woolley, the president of Wright Bros. Real Estate. “They have already been online and know what they like and don’t like. They may have seen 20 pictures of one house.” Potential buyers, he said, now arrive with specific houses in mind.

Dan Murray, a firefighter in the South Bronx, is hedging his bets and working both ends of the real estate equation.

To market their three-bedroom condominium in Riverdale, Mr. Murray and his wife, Diana, placed ads online and paid a one-time fee of $300 to forsalebyowner.com, which placed the property with the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listings Service.

Mr. Murray, 40, is prepared to pay the agent who delivers a buyer 2 percent of the selling price, substantially less than the standard industry fee of 5 percent to 6 percent.

Meanwhile, in his search for a new home in northern Westchester County, he is using maps and satellite photos, while scouring the same sites he is advertising on for a FSBO.

“I would think anyone who is comfortable with the Internet would prefer to do it this way,” Mr. Murray said. “Eventually, who won’t be?”

749 2009-12-20 With Messi down either wing, with Xavi picking out passes as if by the instinct of a homing pigeon, with Andrés Iniesta and Thierry Henry, and now with Zlatan Ibrahimovic replacing Samuel Eto’o as the focal point of attack, it has a style so easy on the eye, yet also so competitive.

Madrid has support from the Spanish institutions prepared to help it pay more than its means to try to ensure that Barcelona does not keep running away with all the prizes. Madrid’s policy was to buy — not just Ronaldo, but also Kaká, Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso and others in a single summer.

What it cannot buy is the roots of Barca’s beauty, its renowned style. That is a product of La Masia, the school built on an 18th century farm in the lea of the club’s Camp Nou stadium.

“The player who has passed through La Masia has something different to the rest,” Coach Josep Guardiola said. “It’s a plus that comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child.”

Guardiola knows, because he passed through the school and played for the first team for a decade before graduating to be its coach. One of his players, the meticulous Xavi, has just played his 500th senior game in the shirt.

Xavi is a born and bred Catalan, a child and now a man of F.C. Barcelona. But though Messi was born abroad, Txiki Begiristain, the club’s technical director, insists, “Mess’s from Argentina, but he was formed in our house.” Indeed he was, from age 13.

That raises the conundrum of 2009. Messi scored the winning goal in extra time Saturday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, as Barcelona defeated Estudiantes de la Plata of Argentina, 2-1. He was the star of stars wherever Barcelona performed, yet he could barely shine for his homeland. He could look like a boy indulging in a great fantasy even in the Champions League final in Rome, but he shrank whenever he pulled on the blue and white stripes of Argentina.

The reason must be Diego Maradona. Once the greatest star of Argentina — and, incidentally, of Barcelona for a time — Maradona took his national squad to the brink of lunacy in his first year of attempted team management. A novice coach, inconsistent and unwilling to listen to advice, he never picked the same lineup twice and came within a hair’s breadth of failing to reach the World Cup.

César Menotti, the coach of Argentina’s 1978 World Cup-winning side, spelled it out in two sentences: “Argentina does not have a functioning team. Messi is not responsible for the strategy at Barcelona, he is the one that completes the moves.”

The star, yes, but the star of a fantastically integrated team.

Europe’s best national side, Spain, is also an integration — of Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla. Another interpretation of integration arose significantly during the year. We saw it in the German side that won the European under-21 championship in Sweden, and saw it again in the Swiss youths who became world under-17 champions in Nigeria.

More than half the Germany squad and more than half of Switzerland’s emerging talents were born abroad or are the sons of immigrants. This cosmopolitan makeup, still unusual but perfectly legitimate, is a measure of sports reflecting the shifting patterns of population movement.

The Balkans conflict, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the migration of Africans and the fact that some soccer players settle in countries where their skills took them are changing the gene pool of international sports — not simply of soccer.

The youth successes of today may well mature into the pattern of tomorrow. And if soccer maintains its global aspect — especially if FIFA allows players of dual nationality to choose for which country they play — the trend seen in Germany and Switzerland could become a template.

Soccer, however, struggles to close its doors to another international trend: corruption. Police officers in Central Europe are starting to unravel match-fixing scams, some of them initiated in Asia. FIFA ended 2009 by calling in Interpol to try to track down the gang leaders who are suspected of manipulating the spread of on-line betting.

The year ends with suspicion and arrests, but thus far no trials.

Meanwhile, a World Cup beckons. It is shaping up to be a tournament of dirty hands and clean shoes. The blatant hand ball of Henry, which helped give France a place at the World Cup in South Africa, contrasts with the delightful tale of Slovenia.

Borut Pahor, the Slovene prime minister, vowed that he would clean the players’ shoes if Slovenia, population two million, knocked out Russia, population 142 million, in qualification. It did in November, and the prime minister kept his promise.
750 2009-12-20 Alexis Amann and Jonathan Burstein’s “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” at 986 Market Street, is a wonderful example of storefront art. This duo’s luminous, marine-hued installation depicting an underwater landscape — complete with sharks, seaweed and a newspaper-reading deep-sea diver — playfully stands out against the strip clubs, boarded-up facades and 24-hour doughnut shops of Central Market.

The cardboard-cutout montage has a children’s comic-book feel. But on closer inspection, the piece has a satirical, dystopian edge more akin to the work of Art Spiegelman or the local graphic novelist Jon Adams than to Richard Scarry. The diver’s newspaper carries the headline “Homeowners Underwater! Tsunami of Foreclosures”; miniature human heads bob forlornly atop seaweed strands; and a menacing shark has the word “loans” painted on its side.

Although delivered with humor, the message is clear: the Central Market neighborhood is underwater, and locals must fight to stay afloat.

Chris Treggiari and Billy Mitchell’s installation at 144 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin has a similarly powerful neighborhood connection and strong visual appeal. Unlike the other projects around town, their work, “Fight for Your Neighborhood,” stands in front of a derelict restaurant — a shuttered facade that once belonged to the San Francisco institution Original Joe’s — rather than behind the safety of glass.

This colorful, street-level artwork, with its painted prizefighter and wooden boxing ring surrounded by posters of local residents with their fists raised, pays homage to the neighborhood’s boxing history. It also physically mimics the challenges facing the area as it fights for survival in a depressed economy.

Mr. Treggiari said his artwork had been vandalized a few times. (When I recently visited, a piece of wood had been torn off and thrown into the boxing ring.) But residents have reportedly rallied around the installation.

“The neighborhood has truly taken ownership over the project,” Mr. Treggiari said. “I’ve recently received reports from friends who have seen paintings left by my piece. I hope it continues to inspire creativity within the community, because this is really what it’s all about.”

Just as this artwork mutates over time, the other San Francisco installations (as well as similar storefront projects in cities as diverse as New York, London and Cape Girardeau, Mo.) face change — and ultimately eviction.

According to Daniel Hurtado, executive director of the Central Market Community Benefit District, planned retail projects in the area will soon force out two artworks. And in the Tenderloin, Elvin Padilla, executive director of the Tenderloin Economic Development Project, expects the Original Joe’s site to be developed in 2010.

The Art in Storefronts project is undeniably laudable from a social and cultural standpoint. Both residents and artists are benefiting. Christopher Simmons, one of the creators of the work “Everything Is O.K.,” at 998 Market Street, said that he had had an increase in visitors to his Facebook page since the unveiling of his installation, and that he was in talks with galleries about future commissions.

It’s great that San Francisco is taking an art-forward stance during the recession. Care, however, should be taken to preserve these artworks and prevent commerce from dictating all the rules. Let’s hope that the city continues to support local artists when its “storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light” — as Allen Ginsberg irreverently depicts the urban metropolis in “Howl” — once again ring with the sound of jangling cash registers.
751 2009-12-20 F. William McCalpin, one of the earliest advocates and most vocal defenders of the Legal Services Corporation, a federal program that has provided legal aid to millions of poor people, died Dec. 9 at his home in St. Louis. He was 88.

The cause was complications from a fall, his son William said.

Mr. McCalpin, who butted heads with the Reagan administration when it sought to eliminate the program he had long championed, was chairman of the corporation from 1979 through 1981 and a member of its board from 1993 to 2003.

Legal Services was created by Congress in 1974 with the backing of President Richard M. Nixon and, with federal financing, today supports 137 organizations in all 50 states. The organizations offer legal representation to about one million poor people involved in noncriminal cases and legal advice to five million more.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan tried to abolish the Legal Services Corporation by cutting its $321 million allocation from the federal budget. Reagan had long maintained that legal aid lawyers were activists too willing to pursue their own vision of the public interest.

Over the years, legal aid lawyers have filed many class-action and law-reform suits, among them efforts to force federal, state and local governments to pay benefits mandated by social welfare legislation, to improve hospital services for the poor and to improve prison conditions. The lawyers have spent most of their time, however, on routine matters like family disputes, disability claims and landlord-tenant problems.

754 2009-12-20 IT was, readers of The New York Times recently learned, a very good year for Paramount Pictures. Two of the year’s biggest hits, “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra” and “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” have helped the studio climb out of its financial hole with a combined domestic take of more than $500 million. Both movies are deeply stupid, often incoherent and hinged on the principle that the spectacle of violence is its own pleasurable end. “Transformers” is also casually racist. But hey, that’s entertainment.

Or, more specifically, that’s Hollywood entertainment in the conglomerate age. The major studios have long been in the business of serving sludge to the world, but now the reek often spreads around the globe simultaneously with massive coordinated openings. “Revenge of the Fallen,” for instance, opened the same day on more than 4,000 screens in the United States — about a 10th of all the screens in the country — and soon about 10,000 more abroad. “Angels & Demons,” the sequel to “The Da Vinci Code,” opened on some 3,500 screens domestically and ate up more than 10,000 internationally. The French film “Summer Hours,” meanwhile, the best-reviewed release in The Times that weekend, opened on two screens.

The question of consumer choice becomes all but moot when the Top 5 box office movies are playing on more than one-quarter of all the screens in America, as was the case during the first weekend of May, when “Star Trek” opened. That weekend 10 movies dominated 67 percent of the country’s screens. Three of those titles were released by Paramount. Warner Brothers and Disney had two movies each; 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and the independent company Summit Entertainment each had one. (It’s worth noting that National Amusements, the company that has a controlling stake in Viacom, the entertainment conglomerate that in turn runs Paramount, owns more than 1,500 screens around the world.)

The problem isn’t blockbusters per se or certain kinds of genre movies or inflated budgets: “Star Trek,” wittily directed by J. J. Abrams, is an entertaining rethink of a defining science-fiction brand, and the even pricier “Avatar,” from James Cameron, is in a class by itself. But these remain exceptions to the flashier, noisier, dumber rule of much of today’s mega-budget entertainment. Movies have always been segmented among different audiences, but the disparity between the work that earns most of the critical love at release — and awards — time and much of what fills the multiplex on a weekly basis seems greater than ever. Paramount sells the audience “G. I. Joe” and sells Oscar voters (and critics) “Up in the Air.”

That divide between the studios’ bulk product and their prestige items has become even more conspicuous because so many specialty units have been closed, absorbed or downsized in the last two years, leaving executives with fewer reasons to go to the Oscars. (Just two years ago Paramount Vantage, the specialty unit of Paramount, released “There Will Be Blood,” one of the finest American movies of the past 50 years. Vantage has since been folded into big Paramount.) A few specialty units remain, however, including Fox Searchlight, which might be why 20th Century Fox feels free to release so many stinkers, including franchise leftovers (“X-Men Origins: Wolverine”) and female-minstrelsy shows (“Bride Wars”). The same holds true over at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which would have been largely an aesthetic wasteland this year without Sony Pictures Classics.
755 2009-12-20 It was a week to think about Wall Street and money — who makes it and who takes it — as the vault door closed on the era of the Big Bailout. The same week President Obama chided “fat cat bankers” for raising their pay in tough times, the last of the big banks to take bailout money said they were moving to repay billions that had propped them up — and free themselves of the restrictions on pay that came with the money. Perhaps no moment better captured the shift in power from Washington, where it had tilted during the dark days of last autumn, back to its historic center. After the meltdown, many had hoped policy makers would rewrite the rules for the financial industry. Now, nearly all of the biggest banks have wiggled out from under Uncle Sam’s thumb. The crisis is over, the profits are piling up, and Washington can no longer call the shots on banker pay.
756 2009-12-20 THE longest-running lie I tell on the holidays is: “I can’t be there on (Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year’s, fill in the blank). I am flying that day.”

The thing about this lie is that I have willed it to be true. I have such a loathing of New Year’s Eve, for instance, that I have contrived to be on an overseas American Airlines flight at the stroke of midnight for the last six years. (The more humane pilots wish you a happy New Year over the intercom.)

This “lie” has become a great source of comfort to me over the years. Flying on Christmas Day, for example, is a good way to avoid lemminglike airport scenes, not to mention the tense moment when one’s mother makes the annual presentation of the boxer shorts and the blue merino dress socks.

I get a private viewing of the socks and underwear box if I arrive late. It certainly makes commentary about this year’s clever new J. Crew patterns much easier if the audience is limited.

The year my “fly by lie” plan became an unintentional epic was when I told everyone my flight to Los Angeles would arrive late at night, a few minutes into Boxing Day. In fact, I took off from Kennedy airport at 7 a.m. on Christmas and arrived in Los Angeles by noon, as always.

I love Los Angeles, my hometown, at Christmastime. The juxtaposition of tacky street decorations with leafy green trees and incessant “Little Drummer Boy” Muzak puts me in a kind of Didion-themed trance, sans Quaaludes. I had contrived to take Christmas as a sort of personal day — yes, spurning my family for a marathon afternoon and evening of movies with friends.
757 2009-12-20 “I understand the situation that Nate is in the last year and he has to play,” Walsh said in a telephone interview, “so if that’s the option that he wants to pursue, I told him I’ll talk about it.”

Walsh said he wanted to see “if this can be straightened out” before deciding whether to pursue a trade. But it appears that D’Antoni has no intention of playing Robinson again. He left him on the bench Thursday and Friday, despite the absence of Larry Hughes, who was resting a strained groin muscle.

Robinson, a potent scorer, has remained idle even on nights when the Knicks have struggled to make a basket — as they did in the second half against Chicago on Thursday and the first half against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday. The Knicks lost to the Bulls but beat the Clippers.

“They were 4 of 23 in the third quarter,” Goodwin said, referring to the Chicago game, “and when you lose a big lead and you’re shooting that bad in one quarter, and he didn’t even look at Nate Robinson, I called Donnie Walsh. Because I realized at that point he had no intention of playing Nate again.”

Robinson has even slipped behind two marginal players — Eddy Curry, who has struggled with conditioning and injuries; and Jonathan Bender, who just joined the Knicks last week and had not played since 2005. Bender played 14 minutes Friday night, and Robinson stayed on the bench for the eighth straight game.

Goodwin called the decision to play Bender instead of Robinson, “pretty ridiculous” and indicative of D’Antoni’s stance toward Robinson.

D’Antoni did not immediately return a call seeking comment. He has not hidden his frustration with Robinson’s immaturity and impulsiveness, although he has never cited those factors in the benching.

Goodwin said that Robinson has “done everything that he’s been asked,” to no avail. The Knicks have gone 5-3 since Robinson was dropped from the rotation.

When he first benched Robinson three weeks ago, D’Antoni said he wanted to give more playing time to the rookie Toney Douglas, whose defense he praised. But Douglas has gradually slipped out of the regular rotation as well.

Goodwin, who has had a client on the Knicks’ roster for the last eight years, stressed that he had no ill feelings toward Walsh or team ownership. He compared the situation to the impasse between D’Antoni and Stephon Marbury last year, which ended when Marbury was banished and then waived.

“I think it’s more than clear to anyone involved, including Donnie, that this has nothing to do with Nate Robinson as a basketball player,” Goodwin said. “Donnie and I need to work together to get Nate out of there as quickly as possible.”

778 2009-12-21 Pfizer said Sunday that it was buying the rights to a somewhat controversial cell therapy from Athersys, a biotechnology company — a sign of big pharmaceutical companies’ growing interest in stem cells.

Pfizer will have the rights to develop Athersys’s cells to treat inflammatory bowel disease, the companies are expected to announce on Monday. It will pay Athersys $6 million initially and up to $105 million in the future.

The relatively small payment reflects that “it’s really early for cell therapy and there’s more research to be done,” said Ruth McKernan, chief scientific officer of Pfizer Regenerative Medicine, a unit created by the company about 18 months ago to develop treatments based on stem cells.

Athersys’s cells, derived from human bone marrow, have not yet been tested in people with inflammatory bowel disease, a term that encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. But the product, called MultiStem, is in early human testing as a treatment for heart attacks and for cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplants.

Athersys, founded in 1995 and based in Cleveland, is publicly traded and still unprofitable.

Its shares were 182 percent higher, at $2.84 on Monday while Pfizer shares were 2.5 percent higher, at $18.77.
779 2009-12-21 There are people in both camps at St. Mary’s and St. Jerome’s, parishioners said in recent interviews. They work side by side at the food pantry, on the raffle committee and at meetings of the Ladies Guild; they simply avoid the subject around others with different views.

“The most important thing we have is our community, and that’s what has to be preserved,” said Jeanne Tarrant, a longtime member of St. Jerome’s. “There are people who feel differently than I do about the abuse — and about a lot of other things — but I don’t try to change them, and they don’t try to change me.”

In that spirit, the two summer Masses — one for victims, one for an accused priest — went almost unnoticed outside the ranks of those who celebrated them. But one group that cared deeply is Voice of the Faithful, a nationwide organization of Catholic parishioners who banded together after the scandal broke to advocate for abuse victims and more transparency in church affairs.

When a longtime member of St. Jerome’s asked his pastor, the Rev. David Blanchfield, to offer a special Mass for the victims of abuse, Father Blanchfield said he did so without hesitation “because, obviously, it needed to be done.”

But John Marshall Lee, a Voice of the Faithful leader in Connecticut, said the Mass for the deceased priest at St. Mary’s raised questions for some Catholics.

“People who were upset over the Mass for Bietighofer had no objection to saying a Mass for the man,” said Mr. Lee, who belongs to neither parish. “It was that St. Mary’s didn’t also have a Mass for the victims. That seemed odd.”

He asked the pastor there, the Rev. Greg Markey, to offer a Mass for victims, but Father Markey declined. No member of his parish had asked him for such a service, the pastor said, and none had expressed objections to Father Bietighofer’s Mass, which he described as “not a celebration of the life of a predator, but a Mass to pray for a man’s soul.”

People in the parish loved Father Bietighofer, Father Markey said. No one could know for sure whether he had abused anyone. But whether he did or did not, Father Markey said, “he served this parish well for many years.”

For many Catholics, differences over the sex abuse crisis are rooted in deeper, older tensions in the church — between tradition and reform, between parishes like St. Mary’s, with its Latin Masses, and St. Jerome’s, where parishioners playing electric guitar and drums accompany the choir.

Father Markey, a self-described conservative Catholic, upset some parishioners soon after he became pastor of St. Mary’s two years ago by deciding to phase out girls from the ranks of the altar servers. Those in place could stay, the pastor decided, but he reasoned that girls cannot become priests, and altar service should be a gateway to a potential vocation in the priesthood.

The traditional Latin Mass he introduced about the same time is one of the few offered in the state, and has drawn worshipers from a 50-mile radius.

To conservatives like Father Markey, abuses committed in the 1960s and after reflect the “moral decline” of those freewheeling times, the effects of the Second Vatican Council’s liberalization of church rules and the church’s failure to weed out gay men in the priesthood.

“There is a sense that a lot of what happened — not all of it, but a lot — had to do with lapses of theological orthodoxy and the decline of moral life that went with it,” Father Markey said.

To more liberal-leaning Catholics like Father Blanchfield, the abuses reflect a failure to keep up with the times by bringing more diversity — women and lay people in particular — into the church’s decision-making process. People with broad life experience, he said, would more likely have spotted the “psychosexual” problems of those priests who abused.

Both Father Markey and Father Blanchfield agree on at least one point: They are weary of the unrelenting publicity about sex abuse.

Parishioners at both churches said the issue still hovered but did not cast as dark a shadow as it once did. They said common bonds trumped their differing views about it — bonds of faith, mainly, but also connections forged in the prosaic, time-consuming commitments people make to serve on the Buildings and Grounds Committee, to chaperone Teen Night, to volunteer for the bereaved-parishioners dinner squad.

Jane Reichle, a member of St. Mary’s, said another bond was the sense of mourning people felt for the intimacy — once taken for granted and now under constant watch — between priests and parishioners.

Since 2002, Bishop William E. Lori of Bridgeport has adopted several measures, commonly used across the country, which he says are protecting children from future abuse by priests. The diocese has conducted background checks of more than 30,000 clerics, employees and volunteers; it has introduced an abuse-prevention course that 90,000 parishioners, clergy and staff members have completed. When accusations are made against priests, the bishop has said, the matter is turned over to the police.

At a confirmation ceremony at St. Jerome’s one recent Sunday, as a standing-room-only crowd of families looked on, Bishop Lori spoke to the 42 young confirmands about the importance of practicing their faith, then anointed each one, making the sign of the cross.

As the service entered its second hour, Jack Bellairs, 87, grandfather of Jordan Michael Bellairs, 13, snapped a picture with a disposable camera, then went outside to have a cigarette. He said he had “followed all that stuff, sure” in the newspapers about sex abuse. But this was a great day — seeing his grandson become a full-fledged member of the Catholic Church.

“Why?” he repeated, seeming to find the question incomprehensible.

“Because I believe in life after death,” he said, blowing cigarette smoke in the rain. “And I want my grandson to be with me when I get there.”
780 2009-12-21 Critics of credit-default swaps like the “empty creditor” hypothesis. The theory is that buyers of credit insurance can profit by allowing  or even encouraging  companies to file for bankruptcy. It’s used as an argument for banning or severely restricting the $31 trillion market for credit-default swaps. In reality, the empty creditor hypothesis is probably half full.

Credit-default swaps allow traders to insure themselves against a company’s default. Empty creditors are investors who have hedged with credit-default swaps and who stand to benefit if companies go bust, because the payout on the swap would make them whole on the value of their debt.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association set out to debunk the hypothesis in a research paper published on Dec. 17. The association is right to dismiss one element of the theory: the notion that traders of credit-default swaps can make quick profits from a company’s final spiral into bankruptcy.

The big flaw in this part of the theory is that traders can’t actually make much if any money doing that, because buying bankruptcy protection in the credit derivative markets gets very expensive as companies near failure. At the end of 2008, the cost of insuring against default on $10 million of General Motors bonds in the credit-default swap market was $8 million  payable upfront  plus $500,000 a year for up to five years. That was almost six months before G.M. finally filed for bankruptcy on June 1.

Upon bankruptcy, buyers of credit-default swaps receive the insured amount less the recovery rate on the bonds. In G.M.’s case, the recovery rate was set by auction at 12.5 cents on the dollar. That means someone who bought swaps half a year before the company filed would scarcely have broken even. In the immediate timeframe before G.M.’s bankruptcy, the trade would have been loss-making. Fingering credit-default swap traders for companies’ short-term problems or final death throes is much like blaming short-sellers of stock: both are almost invariably the messengers, not the message.

But the International Swaps and Derivatives Association is mistaken in trying to knock down a central thrust of the empty creditor hypothesis. This argues that investors owning a company’s debt as well as the related credit-default swaps can prevent or distort a restructuring outside bankruptcy if the company gets into trouble. After all, blocking alternatives so that a company eventually has to file for bankruptcy would lead to a fat payout on the swaps.

As far as the association is concerned, there is no evidence that the ratio of bankruptcies to out-of-court restructurings has picked up since the credit derivatives market boomed. Still, the fear is that this dynamic could force companies into an otherwise avoidable collapse  or at least interfere with a restructuring. It’s fodder for those who want to ban credit-default swaps, or at least want creditors who hedge with them to have restricted voting rights.

And despite the group’s conclusion, credit derivatives clearly do in practice sometimes gum things up when companies are trying to negotiate out-of-court restructurings. Some of these debt revampings, as well as outright bankruptcies, can lead to payouts on credit-default swap contracts.

Whether that happens can depend on the terms of the restructuring, an interaction that has caused uncertainties in several recent cases, including a debt exchange carried out by Cemex, the Mexican cement giant. Wind Hellas, the Greek telecommunications company that recently entered a pre-packaged bankruptcy, said attempts to restructure its debt would have been complicated by the presence of credit default swap holders.

Companies need to bear this issue in mind when they draft credit agreements. But instead of playing down the issue, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association could help, too. The industry group has already missed a trick or two in the face of widespread criticism of derivatives trading practices that go well beyond credit-default swap instruments. Rather than trying to defend everything about the industry, it should emphasize the useful features of derivatives markets while recognizing, and trying to address, their flaws.

This means making a concerted effort to find better ways to manage the difficulties posed by creditors who own credit-default swaps in restructurings. The extreme solution  draconian curbs on the voting rights of hedged investors  would not be workable. But a good first step could be full disclosure of which creditors are hedged with credit-default swaps before restructuring discussions begin. RICHARD BEALES and NEIL UNMACK
781 2009-12-21 The global climate negotiations in Copenhagen produced neither a grand success nor the complete meltdown that seemed almost certain as late as Friday afternoon. Despite two years of advance work, the meeting failed to convert a rare gathering of world leaders into an ambitious, legally binding action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It produced instead a softer interim accord that, at least in principle, would curb greenhouses gases, provide ways to verify countries’ emissions, save rain forests, shield vulnerable nations from the impacts of climate change, and share the costs.

The hard work has only begun, in Washington and elsewhere. But Copenhagen’s achievements are not trivial, given the complexity of the issue and the differences among rich and poor countries. President Obama deserves much of the credit. He arrived as the talks were collapsing, spent 13 hours in nonstop negotiations and played hardball with the Chinese. With time running out  and with the help of China, India, Brazil and South Africa  he forged an agreement that all but a handful of the 193 nations on hand accepted.

Mr. Obama aside, there were two keys to the deal. One was a dramatic offer of $100 billion in aid from the industrialized nations to poorer countries to help them move to less-polluting sources of energy and to deal with drought and other consequences of warming. The offer had an instant soothing effect on many poorer nations that had been threatening to walk out all week.

The other was China’s willingness to submit to a verification system under which all countries would agree to report on their actions and  assuming details could be worked out  open their books to inspection. Transparency is a huge issue in Congress, and Mr. Obama made clear in his opening remarks on Friday that he would not agree to a deal unless China gave ground.

An enormous amount of work lies ahead, both for the president and for the other signatories to what is now being called the Copenhagen Accord. In order to deliver on his promises to reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 and provide a chunk of that $100 billion in aid, Mr. Obama must persuade the Senate to approve a cap-and-trade bill  a huge task.

Meanwhile, there can be no letup by the rest of the world’s negotiators, no matter how tired and beat up they may be. These talks have been so chaotic and contentious that some people believe the United Nations machinery has outlived its usefulness, and real progress will henceforth be made in smaller gatherings of the big players.

There may be some truth to this, but at the moment it is hard to see how many of the arrangements agreed to in principle at Copenhagen  the verification system, for instance  can be made to work without detailed agreements. There must also be some mechanism that holds all countries responsible for doing everything they can to tackle climate change. As it is, the pledges now on the table, from both rich and poor countries, are nowhere near enough to keep atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide from rising above dangerous levels.

But for the moment it is worth savoring the steps forward. China is now a player in the effort to combat climate change in a way it has never been, putting measurable emissions reductions targets on the table and accepting verification. And the United States is very much back in the game too. After eight years of playing the spoiler, it is now a leader with a president who seems to embrace the role.
782 2009-12-21 The Citadel Broadcasting Corporation, one of the nation’s largest radio broadcasters, filed for bankruptcy in New York on Sunday after agreeing to turn over control of the company to its creditors in exchange for reducing its debt.

The filing by the company, which owns 224 stations across the country and syndicates Don Imus’s radio show, was not unexpected but does reflect the troubles plaguing the radio industry amid steep declines in advertising revenue and big debt loads.

For now, some media companies facing debt problems have been able to buy themselves some time by refinancing as the capital markets recover. Clear Channel Communications, Citadel’s biggest rival, sold $2.5 billion in bonds last week through its Clear Channel Outdoor affiliate, which will go toward paying down some of its debt. But many others are still trying to find ways to address their shrinking revenues.

Citadel chose to address its debt burden by filing for what is known as a prearranged bankruptcy, in which a company secures the consent of a wide swath of its creditors. The broadcaster said Sunday that its Chapter 11 filing was supported by more than 60 percent of its lenders.

“We are pleased with the support from the majority of our senior lenders, and we look forward to working with the remaining senior lenders and other stakeholders to ensure a complete and expeditious restructuring,” Farid Suleman, Citadel’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Our business will continue as usual and the company will work to emerge from the restructuring process as quickly as possible.”
783 2009-12-21 This year, Lookout began testing security software for phones running the Windows Mobile and Android operating systems, and it will soon introduce security applications for the BlackBerry and iPhone. The software protects phones against rogue programs and gives phone owners the ability to remotely back up and erase the data on their phones. It also lets them track the location of their handset on the Web.

A basic version of the software is free, while the company plans to charge a monthly subscription for a version with more features.

“It feels a lot like it did in 1999 in desktop security,” said John Hering, Lookout’s 26-year-old chief executive, who for years has done research demonstrating security vulnerabilities in phones. “People are using the mobile Web and downloading applications more than ever before, and there are threats that come with that.”

Lookout represents the latest attempt to build a new business that capitalizes on the surge of smartphones. Thousands of companies making mobile games, shopping tools and other programs have sprung up in the last two years as the iPhone in particular has taken off. Lookout and its investors believe this is the right time to get into the market.

“The rules of mobile are different,” said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, which also recently invested in Square, a mobile payments start-up. “This is people’s most personal computer, and it needs to be protected.”

Companies like Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Good Technology, a Silicon Valley-based mobile messaging firm, already offer mobile security tools, but their systems are aimed at businesses. Security firms like Symantec also have mobile security divisions, and a five-year-old company, Trust Digital, based in McLean, Va., has set its sights on this market.

Lookout says it can address the unique challenges of protecting cellphones, like preserving battery life. While the company will not give details, it says it has figured out how to get its software to work on the iPhone, which does not allow non-Apple programs to operate in the background, as security software typically does.

Mr. Hering and his co-founder, Kevin Mahaffey, 25, have been publicly demonstrating the weaknesses of mobile phones for some time. In 2005, they camped outside the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood and scanned the phones of stars walking the red carpet, using a short-range Bluetooth wireless connection. They found that as many as 100 of the phones were vulnerable to hacking over such a connection.

That year, at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, they hacked into a phone over a mile away using Bluetooth.

Lookout’s founders and backers concede that for now, snoops and bad guys pose much less of a threat to cellphones than to PCs. But they believe there is an immediate need for software that preserves and protects a phone’s data, from e-mail to corporate information, and they say current systems do not work when a family or business has multiple types of cellphones on various wireless networks.

For instance, a small business could install the Lookout software on many different types of devices, back up all the data and remotely erase a phone if, say, an employee leaves it in a cab.

Jeff Moss, a security expert and organizer of the Black Hat conference, said mobile security had historically “been a solution in search of a problem.” But he said mobile viruses had recently become more common in Asia. His own Nokia N97 phone even caught a bug recently, though software he was running from F-Secure, a Finnish security company, caught it in time.

“The tipping point will be when we’re using the phone to shop and conduct banking,” Mr. Moss said. “The more you do with the phone, the more valuable a target it becomes.”
784 2009-12-21 Re “Eminent Domain in New York” (editorial, Dec. 14): New York’s eminent domain laws are in need of reform. The Empire State Development Corporation’s attempted taking of private property on behalf of Columbia University illustrates how the current process lacks accountability, transparency or meaningful public participation.

The corporation cited “blight” to justify property condemnation. But the current definition of “blight” is vague. Absurd criteria, like the cracked sidewalks and loose awnings cited in Columbia’s decision, could be used to identify any neighborhood as blighted.

Furthermore, weak disclosure laws allowed Columbia to ignore Freedom of Information Law requests from property owners.

The appellate court wrote that “many commentators have noted that ‘few policies have done more to destroy community and opportunity for minorities than eminent domain.’ ” Current laws are a holdover from the so-called urban renewal schemes that decimated low-income and minority neighborhoods.

I am preparing legislation to address the flaws in existing law, and have requested Gov. David A. Paterson to impose a statewide moratorium on condemnation actions.

Since 2005, 43 states have changed their eminent domain laws to better protect home and business owners. It is now time for New York to do the same.
785 2009-12-21 Finding connections between John Cage and Phil Kline, experimental composers from different generations and backgrounds, is not very hard. Cage, the Zen master whose chance operations loosened the strictures of contemporary music, surely provided an early model for the random serendipities of Mr. Kline’s subsequent boombox compositions like “Unsilent Night,” a seasonal processional that wound through Greenwich Village streets just over a week ago.

Not everything about Cage and Mr. Kline links up so neatly. But highlighting connections between modern classics and more recent works is among the specialties of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble (better known by its acronym, ACME), a vibrant, versatile group founded by the cellist Clarice Jensen in 2004. Two works from each composer formed a coherent, satisfying experience in a dual portrait concert presented by ACME on Thursday night at the Tank, on West 45th Street in Clinton. One connection was immediately evident. Mr. Kline has long been associated with the composers’ collective Bang on a Can; in Cage’s “Credo in Us,” which opened the concert, the percussionists Haruka Fujii and Chris Thompson literally banged on cans — as well as drums and other metallic objects — in an exhilarating barrage of proto-Minimalist beats.

The pianist Jonathan Yates joined in the melee with dry rhythmic lines that sometimes threatened to break into a Cuban vamp; elsewhere he offered melodic asides. Ms. Jensen, seated on the stage floor with a phonograph, interjected crackly bursts from recordings of “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” “Le Sacre du Printemps” and “The Blue Danube” into the mix.

The boombox element in Mr. Kline’s “Exquisite Corpses,” composed in 1997 for the Bang on a Can All-Stars, worked like a music box cranked into overdrive. Against its insistent twinkle, the ACME players jumped from one musical allusion to another: gentle waltz patterns, tangy klezmer clarinet licks and surging tango rhythms rushed by in a bristling succession.

Between those works Ms. Jensen, the violinists Yuki Numata and Ben Russell, and the violist Nadia Sirota offered eloquent accounts of Cage’s serene String Quartet in Four Parts and Mr. Kline’s melancholy “Blue Room and Other Stories.” Mr. Kline’s piece, composed for the string quartet Ethel in 2002 and played here for the first time in an unamplified arrangement, underscored the concert’s subtlest highlight: through ACME’s versatility, pieces Mr. Kline created for specific performers entered a repertory available to all.

796 2009-12-22 HOW TO NEGOTIATE When it comes to the mechanics of negotiating, Daniel J. Adams, writing in American Salesman, offers these two thoughts.

First, never negotiate piecemeal. “Insist that the buyer put all the issues onto the table before addressing any of them,” he says. “That way, one can assess what’s at stake and fashion an offer, which balances the totality of the requests with what the seller is able to concede.”

Second, when potential buyers ask for a price concession, as they invariably will, you should never drop the price. “Instead,” he says, “offer additional products or services that equal or exceed the requested discount. The impact of a price drop on your net income would be substantial, whereas providing a product or service decreases your net income only by the wholesale or internal cost of that extra product or service.”

GIVE TO GET Roger Dawson, author of “Secrets of Power Negotiating for Salespeople” (Career Press, 1999), suggests that you remember this basic tactic when you enter into a negotiation of any kind: Never make a concession without asking for one in return. If you do ask, these three good things could happen:

1. You could actually get the concession.

2. It elevates the value of the concession you are being asked to make.

3. It could wear down the other side. If they know you are going to ask for something every time they do, they may soon get tired of asking.

IT’S NOT YOUR PROBLEM “In most negotiations, you will hear all of the other side’s problems and reasons they can’t give you what you want,” Jeff and Rich Sloan write on the small-business Web site they founded, StartupNation.

“They want their problems to become yours, but don’t let them. Instead, deal with each as they come up and try to solve them. If their budget is too low, for example, maybe there are other places that money could come from.”

LAST CALL A sense of humor is a tremendous asset to any dealmaker, Marc Diener writes on the Negotiation Training Institute’s Web site.

“Oh, we may think business negotiation is just about numbers, schedules, contracts and the like, but it’s really about psychology, rapport and trust,” Mr. Diener says. “Here, humor is one of our best tools.

“When negotiations begin, everyone is a little nervous. It’s natural. There may be a lot at stake and no matter how skilled, prepared and well positioned you are, you might find yourself outmaneuvered. With tensions running high, there’s no better social lubricant than humor.”

He adds: “As discussions grind on, humor brings perspective and can stimulate creative solutions, like this one: ‘I wanted a new TV. My wife wanted a new car. So we compromised. We got the TV, but keep it in the garage.’ ”

Defending champion Spain was given until Jan. 11 to choose the site for its opener against Switzerland, which could pit Rafael Nadal against Roger Federer.
811 2009-12-22 Just more than a year ago, Cambodia was praised by the United Nations for its work on behalf of refugees. It was one of only two nations in Southeast Asia to sign the 1951 international convention on refugees, and it opened a brand new office that seemed to suggest a new determination to protect refugees’ human rights.

That was then. Today, Cambodia has baldly violated its international commitments and put at risk the lives of 20 members of the Uighur minority — including two infants — who were forcibly deported back to China on Friday.

Poor, weak Cambodia is not the only villain in this piece. China shoulders even more blame for misusing its growing wealth and clout to force Cambodia to do its bidding. Already Cambodia’s largest foreign investor, China rewarded Cambodia on Monday with 14 deals, valued at an estimated $850 million, including help in building roads and repairing Buddhist temples.

The Uighurs, members of a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who say the Chinese government discriminates against them, entered Cambodia about a month ago with the aid of Christian missionaries and asked for asylum. China has been cracking down on the Uighurs since the ethnic unrest in July, the worst in decades.

Beijing said that at least 197 people — mostly majority Han Chinese — were killed in that violence. Han Chinese retaliated and hundreds of Uighurs have since been detained. Several of the fugitive Uighurs told the United Nations in written statements that they had been involved in the unrest and feared lengthy jail terms or even the death penalty if they were returned to China.

Chinese authorities claimed the Uighurs were criminals but offered no proof. Such charges are often a specious excuse of repressive societies, but in any case the Uighurs had protected status while their asylum cases were being investigated by the United Nations’ refugee agency. China and Cambodia had a responsibility under international law to allow that process to be completed.
812 2009-12-22 A member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family accused of torturing an Afghan grain merchant may have been disoriented and impaired by drugs he used for health problems, his defense argued in court on Monday. A video that came to light in May appears to show the defendant, Sheik Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, torturing the merchant with whips, cattle prods and a plank with a protruding nail, then driving over him with an S.U.V. Sheik Issa, a half brother of the Emirati president, has pleaded not guilty. A forensics expert testified Monday that he was taking a combination of dozens of drugs, including medicine for heart and back conditions.
813 2009-12-22 Apple is eliciting tentative interest from some networks in its proposal to offer a TV subscription package via the Internet.

Theoretically, customers would be able to tune in online, allowing them to cancel their cable or satellite subscriptions.

ABC and CBS are among the networks that are considering joining the Apple venture, people close to the talks said Monday night. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized by their companies to comment on confidential talks. They said that the talks were at a very early stage.

ABC is a unit of the Walt Disney Company, which could also make two of its cable channels, ABC Family and the Disney Channel, available through the proposed service. The CBS Corporation owns half of the CW network, a smaller broadcaster that could also join. Spokesmen for CBS and Disney declined to comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday night that some other major TV companies, including the News Corporation, which owns Fox, and Turner Broadcasting, which owns CNN and TNT, were more wary of Apple’s initial overtures.

Broadband Internet subscriptions to TV networks could potentially destabilize the bedrock of the television business, which relies on subscribers paying for dozens of bundled channels.
814 2009-12-22 Still, Judge Holwell indicated he might be open to an expedited schedule, saying he would confer with United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who is presiding over the civil case, before setting a trial date. The S.E.C. hopes the criminal trial can be concluded before it argues its case, to avoid turning over evidence that could possibly help the defendants in their criminal trial.

Two months ago, Mr. Rajaratnam and Ms. Chiesi were led into a Manhattan court in handcuffs by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in what was the beginning of one of the largest insider trading cases in Wall Street history.

Since Mr. Rajaratnam was arrested and released on $100 million bail, he has spent millions of dollars hiring top criminal defense lawyers and public relations consultants to combat the charges against him. After Mr. Rajaratnam’s arrest, investors quickly pulled more than $4 billion from hedge funds managed by Galleon.

Judge Holwell will consider a request by Mr. Rajaratnam to lower his bail to $20 million at a hearing on Jan. 8.

In a letter submitted to Judge Holwell after the hearing, prosecutors again requested that the criminal case be scheduled before the S.E.C.’s case, in part because of concern that some of their cooperating witnesses would invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against being compelled to incriminate themselves in the civil case, which could taint the jury in the criminal trial.

Last week, the Justice Department decided to delay indicting four others accused of being co-conspirators in the case, fueling speculation that they might be about to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators.

Those include Robert Moffat, a senior official at I.B.M. once considered a contender for the top job at the company; Rajiv Goel, an executive of Intel; Anil Kumar, an executive at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company; and Mark Kurland, an associate of Ms. Chiesi at the hedge fund New Castle Partners.

Also yet to be indicted are more than a dozen others charged in November with passing tips and trading on secret corporate information. Six people, including a lawyer from the law firm Ropes & Gray and two hedge fund managers, have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government.

Critical to the case is Roomy Khan, who has been cooperating with the government, and another confidential source who has been working with the government since at least July 2007. Ms. Khan pleaded guilty to securities fraud and other charges at an arraignment last week.

Mr. Rajaratnam was not accompanied by any relatives in court. Gloria Chiesi, Ms. Chiesi’s mother, pleaded her daughter’s position to reporters.

“My daughter is innocent and that is what you will be printing,” she said. “God borrowed my body and gave me this girl. She’s my angel.”

Danielle Chiesi, wearing dark sunglasses, jumped into a silver Lexus with her mother and lawyers outside the court after the hearing.
815 2009-12-22 Re “When Lowering the Odds of Cancer Isn’t Enough” (Well, Dec. 15): The author marvels that women with a higher than usual risk of developing breast cancer don’t rush to take a regular drug dose that will cut their risk by 50 percent. But on reading the column, one discovers that the actual reduction in five-year risk is to 1 percent from 2 percent — a single percentage point.

And that’s the risk of developing breast cancer, not dying from it. Factoring in side effects, costs and hassles, the women don’t seem so crazy. The more meaningful statistic is absolute risk, rather than the relative risk so loved by those selling drugs or promoting other interventions.
816 2009-12-22 Unlike Alexis, who was spared the most common hazards of microprematurity, as neonatologists describe babies weighing less than 500 grams (1.1 pounds), many of these tiny survivors face a lifetime of cognitive, developmental and physical deficits. Some physicians question whether it is always wise to try to keep them alive.

In 2004, for example, the Vermont Oxford Network, a consortium of about 500 hospitals with neonatal intensive care units, reported the results of 4,172 births of infants who weighed 401 to 500 grams. Only 17 percent — 690 babies — survived to be discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit. Most had multiple problems common to extreme prematurity, among them a hole between heart chambers, retinopathy and chronic lung disease.

Most follow-up studies of such tiny survivors have found high rates of poor growth and development, multiple medical problems, including cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits, including mental retardation.

Serious risks remain even for somewhat bigger babies born weighing 500 to 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds), the cutoff for extremely low birth weight. The likelihood that surviving babies will experience developmental lags is especially high among those born to poorly educated and financially challenged parents.

Even in these circumstances, however, babies of extremely low birth weight are now doing better than ever.

At the MacDonald Women’s Hospital and the Rainbow Babies’ and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, which serve primarily a poor population, researchers have been studying the survival and neurological development of extremely small babies for several decades. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, major increases occurred in the percentage of surviving babies (to 71 percent, from 49 percent) and babies who survived without neurological impairment (to 71 percent of survivors, from 65 percent) when re-examined at the corrected age of 20 months.

Survival at Inova Fairfax, which serves mostly well-educated and middle-class families, is now close to 90 percent. The hospital prides itself in the kind of care its tiny babies get from what Dr. Baker called “a very well-orchestrated, consistent, methodical approach, like a dance.” Care starts prenatally, he said, with everything possible done to delay a baby’s premature birth.

Once a tiny baby is born, Dr. Baker said, “senior people lead the show, each baby has its own board-certified neonatologist, and the nurses all know what to do.

“The focus is on the total infant,” he continued. “Every day each baby is looked at system by system. Every morning and every night, we check with one another and discuss what each baby may need.”

Especially close attention is paid the baby’s blood pressure and coagulation, keeping both as normal as possible to reduce the risk of bleeding into the brain, which can cause lasting neurological damage.

Four years ago, the hospital hired Ida Sue Baron, an independent clinical neuropsychologist, to evaluate the long-term results of their efforts at saving babies born weighing less than 2.2 pounds. Dr. Baron has so far extensively tested more than 100 of the 6-year-olds and compared them with a similar number of normal children born full-term.

This year, in the journal Early Human Development, Dr. Baron and colleagues reported finding {ldquo}age-appropriate neurocognitive and behavioral function{rdquo} in a group of school-age children whose birth weight had left them “at high risk for impairment.” The team was surprised to find comparable test results among those born before or after 26 weeks’ gestation and those born at less or more than 750 grams (1.65 pounds).

“The children are not perfect,” Dr. Baron said in an interview. “They’re more vulnerable to problems with attention, planning and working memory, even among those with average I.Q.’s. But they’re doing much better than predicted.

“We’ve begun to look at them again at age 9 and are finding no deterioration as they get into higher grades. Their academic skills have not declined and their behavioral functions have remained stable.”

Dr. Michele Walsh, a neonatologist at the children’s hospital in Cleveland, said in an interview that the Vermont network maintained “an active quality-improvement program.”

Dr. Walsh listed four changes that could account for recent improvement: more selective use of medications, especially corticosteroids that are intended to protect the babies’ lung function but that can damage the brain when overused; doing everything possible to avoid infection; using better methods of ventilation to reduce lung damage; and improved nutrition.

Though it was long feared that feeding these tiny newborns could result in a fatal intestinal infection, now the babies are getting mother’s milk and much more protein intravenously to support their brain development.

Although Dr. Walsh acknowledged that it was expensive to maintain these “million-dollar babies” for many months in neonatal intensive care unit, “spread over a normal healthy lifespan, it’s very cost-effective: there’s a return on the investment when they get out into the work force and pay taxes.”
817 2009-12-22 BANGKOK — China signed 14 deals with Cambodia on Monday worth approximately $1 billion, two days after Cambodia deported 20 ethnic Uighur asylum seekers under strong pressure from Beijing.

The deportation, in defiance of protests by the United States, the United Nations and human rights groups, came on the day before a visit to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, by Vice President Xi Jinping of China.

The package of grants and loans was signed at the end of Mr. Xi’s visit. The Cambodian Foreign Ministry quoted Mr. Xi as saying: “It can be said that Sino-Cambodia relations are a model of friendly cooperation.”

The exact value of the agreements was not announced, but the chief government spokesman, Khieu Kanharith, said they were worth $1.2 billion. “China has thanked the government of Cambodia for assisting in sending back these people,” he said. “According to Chinese law, these people are criminals.”

Members of a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority living mostly in western China, the 20 Uighurs said they were fleeing persecution in a crackdown that followed riots in which the Chinese government said at least 197 people were killed.
818 2009-12-22 It seems that 20th Century Fox got a bit carried away as it counted final “Avatar” grosses. On Sunday Fox said that this 3-D science-fiction epic directed by James Cameron had made $73 million in its debut weekend. But that figure was based on studio estimates of Sunday ticket sales. Early on Monday, after Sunday sales figures were available, Chris Aronson, Fox’s senior vice president for domestic distribution, said “Avatar” had actually raked in $77.3 million in North America over the weekend. That meant that it had beaten Will Smith’s “I Am Legend,” which opened in 2007 at $77.2 million and holds the record for a December opening. Then, a couple of hours later, Fox was forced to try to pick up the confetti, saying the final total for “Avatar” was actually $76.8 million, below the record for “Legend.” And soon thereafter came yet another correction: the final number — Fox promised — was actually $77,025,481.

819 2009-12-22 The questions are particularly interesting because, in general, animal toxins are distinct and specific to each group. For instance, the venoms produced by snakes and scorpions are made of different kinds of toxins. But the tetrodotoxin found in each dish of that deadly buffet is identical.

One explanation could be that each of these animals has independently found a way to synthesize tetrodotoxin. But the toxin is a rather complex molecule that requires several chemical steps to assemble. It seems very unlikely that the molecule would be invented many times over in different animals. Rather, the evidence suggests that animals do not make the toxin themselves.

For instance, when puffer fish are raised in aquariums with filtered, bacteria-free water, they are nontoxic. Similarly, when Japanese newts or Panamanian frogs are raised on special diets, they lose their toxicity. These experiments indicate that tetrodotoxin-bearing animals obtain the toxin from the food chain. Indeed, several species of tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria have now been isolated from puffer fish, the blue-ringed octopus, certain snails and other animals. It appears that the animals become toxic by sequestering the bacterially produced toxin in their tissues.

While those discoveries solve the mystery of the source of tetrodotoxin, they do not quite explain how so many kinds of animals exploit it. Tetrodotoxin attacks an ancient feature of the animal kingdom, blocking channels that normally control the movement of sodium ions across nerve and muscle cell membranes and halting their electrical activity. All animals have these sodium ion channels, and the part of the channel that tetrodotoxin fits into and blocks is generally very similar among them.

This fact raises a simple question: Why aren’t puffer fish dead? How are tetrodotoxin-bearing animals able to withstand high levels of a substance that attacks their nervous systems?

One clue is that not all 120 or so species of puffer fish are toxic or resistant to tetrodotoxin. Toxic species can withstand about 500 to 1,000 times the concentration of tetrodotoxin compared with nontoxic puffers or other fish. The flower egg crab is similarly resistant, and the Japanese newt can withstand an even greater relative concentration of toxin. Most other crabs and newts are sensitive to tetrodotoxin. There must be something different then about toxic, tetrodotoxin-resistant species.

That difference becomes clear from examining their sodium channels in detail. Puffer fish have eight versions of these channels encoded by eight separate genes. Manda Clair Jost and her colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Chicago have discovered that in toxic puffer fish, most or all of these channels have evolved resistance to tetrodotoxin and different groups of puffer fish appear to have independently acquired resistance. Toxin-resistant channels have also been identified in a Japanese newt.

So the most plausible chain of events for the evolution of high-level toxin resistance is that mutations initially occur that afford some protection and that the continuing presence of tetrodotoxin in the environment selects for animals bearing additional mutations until, over time, many or all channels are highly resistant. In this sense, what does not kill the evolving animals makes them stronger, and deadly.

In most cases, tetrodotoxin is an effective defensive weapon. But in the game of natural selection, victory is rarely total or permanent. Predators could evolve resistance via the same path that made prey toxic, and this is exactly what has happened in some snakes in the western United States that now feast on highly toxic newts.

Unlike most snakes that are immobilized, sickened or killed when they try to ingest these newts, members of three species of garter snakes are able to dine on the toxic amphibians. A team of researchers led by Edmund Brodie Jr. of Utah State University and his son Edmund Brodie III of the University of Virginia found that the species have independently evolved tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels. Indeed, some snakes from California are so resistant that the dose of toxin needed to immobilize them is sufficient to kill 900 people.

Remarkably, some of the same channel gene mutations responsible for conferring partial resistance to tetrodotoxin have occurred in different snake species. Moreover, some of these and other mutations have also occurred repeatedly in puffer fish channels.

These precise parallels in channel evolution among species reveal a surprising facet of evolution that biologists had no inkling of before the ability to pinpoint adaptive changes in DNA — namely, that evolution is more reproducible than previously thought. The simple explanation for that profound insight is that given similar agents of natural selection (tetrodotoxin in this case), very different species living in different places on the planet will evolve similar or identical adaptations.

It follows then that evolution is somewhat predictable. Given the prevalence of tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria and the many known uses of the toxin as a defensive weapon strategy, we should expect to find more toxic animal species.

With luck, the discoveries will not be made at dinner.
820 2009-12-22 LOS ANGELES — A California appeals court on Monday rejected Roman Polanski’s request that his decades-old sex case either be dismissed or reviewed again by the courts while he remains under house arrest in Switzerland, but it sharply criticized prosecutors for having failed to review evidence of official misconduct in the case and suggested that Mr. Polanski might be sentenced while still abroad.

The ruling, by a panel of three justices of California’s second appellate district, opened the door to further legal action that might resolve Mr. Polanski’s case without forcing him to be extradited from Switzerland or to serve further jail time.

Mr. Polanski, an Oscar-winning director famous for films including “Chinatown” and “Rosemary’s Baby,” fled Los Angeles in 1978 after 42 days of psychiatric evaluation in prison but before he was sentenced for having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, then 13. Mr. Polanski had pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in an agreement that allowed him to avoid other, harsher charges, including sodomy and rape.

Ms. Geimer has since joined Mr. Polanski’s appeal for dismissal of the case. He has been held by Swiss authorities since September on a request from American officials that he be extradited.

In a 70-page opinion written by Justice Laurie D. Zelon, with the concurrence of Presiding Justice Dennis M. Perluss and Justice Fred Woods, the appeals court ruled that Judge Peter P. Espinoza of Los Angeles Superior Court acted within the bounds of judicial discretion when, this year, he cited Mr. Polanski’s fugitive status in refusing to consider his request for dismissal.
821 2009-12-22 In interviews, business travelers indicated that the most popular travel-related apps fell into two categories: organization aids and location-based tools. Apps like TripIt, for example, allow travelers to consolidate their itineraries into a single digital version that can be shared with co-workers or an assistant.

“To me, the most valuable thing is you have all this itinerary information in one place, and it’s easy to get to,” said Pete Davies, who travels several times a year for his job at a clean technology company. “A year ago, I would carry a whole sheaf of printouts and confirmations with me, and now I have them in one simple place.”

Tools like iReceipt allow travelers to store and organize receipts for expense reporting, reducing the number of hard copies that need to be shuttled around on a trip.

Location-based apps use GPS technology to give users information about restaurants, tourist attractions and even taxi services in their immediate vicinity. Some, like Urbanspoon, focus exclusively on restaurants; others, like Yelp and Google Maps, offer information about everything from dry cleaners to coffee shops. Some also include user reviews.

Downloadable applications have some advantages over their digital alter egos, mobile browser versions of company Web pages. Since the apps are stored on a phone instead of on a distant server, the information can be accessed even when the phone is not connected to the Internet. This means that travelers in an airplane or other location without Internet access can still use the program.

Companies that produce and sell travel management software have taken note of the increasing popularity of mobile apps. Some of the larger companies are introducing tools for smartphones that integrate with corporate office travel software.

“We found that nine out of 10 of our business travelers were using mobile apps,” said Tony D’Astolfo, vice president for worldwide sales and travel at Rearden Commerce.

Rearden created an application for BlackBerrys about 20 months ago and is developing one for the iPhone that will be available in the first quarter of 2010 in response to its growing popularity among business travelers. Using the application, travelers can aggregate schedules and reservations as well as find places to eat or receive travel-related alerts about flight delays, for instance.

Another travel management software provider, Concur, has released BlackBerry, iPhone and Windows Mobile apps to support its travel and expense platform. Users do not need to save receipts and file expense reports because the tool tracks and automatically submits charges for flights, hotels, meals and even cab rides.

Concur’s co-founder, president and chief operating officer, Rajeev Singh, said the applications also tap into business travelers’ desire to have more autonomy in arranging their itineraries.

Travelers prefer to choose from various options rather than be told where they have to stay, Mr. Singh said. To this end, Concur has set up a tool that allows travelers to review hotels and leave notes about amenities, like Wi-Fi and fitness rooms, for company colleagues.

Lodging companies, including Choice Hotels, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Omni Hotels and the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort have begun experimenting with apps that let guests find and book other properties under the same management umbrella.

Norman Rose, senior technology and corporate market analyst for the travel industry research company PhoCusWright, said there was still untapped potential for hotels. “The biggest opportunity for hotels is automating the concierge function,” he said. “Hotels recommend restaurants and activities. Being able to deliver this via a virtual concierge is a natural extension.”

Loren Gray, director of e-commerce for Ocean Properties, a company that owns and manages hotels, said app technology offered a lot of potential, but was limited by privacy concerns.

For instance, an application could automatically check travelers into their hotels and register their preferences when they turn on their phone as the plane lands. But travelers might not want to give their phone permission to automatically submit information, which could include credit card data.

Perhaps a greater challenge lies in the fact that an application like this would require access to different hotel companies’ networks; some chains might be reluctant to allow that, citing competitive reasons, Mr. Gray said.

Despite the challenges, industry analysts predict that smartphones will soon be as important to business travelers as credit cards.
822 2009-12-22 Now Mr. Liddell could be in the running to become chief executive at G.M., either when Mr. Whitacre is ready to step aside or at some point after that.

The previous chief executive, Fritz Henderson, and his most recent predecessor, Rick Wagoner, each served time as G.M.’s finance chief before being promoted to the top job.

“The C.F.O. office is historically one of the tickets to the corner office,” said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. “Finance has become so critical in how companies operate and where the value is being created. Obviously any C.F.O. is well positioned to be considered.”

At Microsoft, Mr. Liddell carried out a plan this year to help weather the economic downturn that included the software company’s first mass layoffs, wage freezes and other spending cutbacks. Microsoft also said it returned $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks in the most recent fiscal year.

Mr. Liddell, 51, became Microsoft’s chief financial officer in 2005 after holding the same position at International Paper Company. He had also been chief executive at a forestry products company in his native New Zealand and an investment banker, but has no automotive experience.

He has an engineering degree from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and a master’s in philosophy from Oxford University in England. and is a former director of the New Zealand Rugby Union.

Mr. Liddell earned $3.7 million at Microsoft in the 2009 fiscal year and will receive $1.9 million after leaving the company. He will earn significantly less at G.M., at least initially, because the company must adhere to executive pay limits tied to the $50 billion it borrowed from the federal government in the last year.

Among his expected near-term responsibilities at G.M. will be to position the company for a public stock offering as soon as next year.

“Chris brings a depth and experience to this job that were unmatched in our search for a new financial leader,” Mr. Whitacre said in a statement. “We’re also looking to his experience and insights in corporate strategy as a member of the senior leadership team in helping our restructuring efforts.”

G.M.’s efforts to clean up its balance sheet include the probable closing, announced Friday, of its Saab division.

But Spyker Cars, a tiny Dutch automaker that is seeking to buy Saab from General Motors, extended its offer for the beleaguered Swedish company, keeping alive slim hopes that Saab would survive despite G.M.’s threat to shut it down.

G.M. turned down Spyker’s first offer for Saab on Friday, but Spyker returned Sunday with a new proposal.

“Spyker has been in contact with G.M. today, and continues to develop its proposal for the purchase of Saab,” the company said in a statement. “Spyker has extended the validity of its proposal therefore until further notice.”

G.M. has said it will study the Spyker offer as well as other potential bids for Saab, but will close Saab if a buyer cannot be found by Dec. 31.

Spyker said the new offer addressed the concerns that G.M. raised last week, including whether Spyker could qualify for a loan of 400 million euros from the European Investment Bank. Spyker said the new proposal did not require the E.I.B.’s financing.

Despite the deadline extension, Spyker’s offer remains a long shot. The “wind down” process that G.M. began Friday is continuing even as it studies potential bids.

G.M. officials have not specified publicly what the problems were with Spyker’s initial bid, but several officials with knowledge of the negotiations said it was Spyker’s reliance on Russian financing for the deal, as well as an issue of whether Russian competitors might end up benefiting from G.M.’s latest designs.
823 2009-12-22 LONDON (AP) — The London Stock Exchange said on Monday that it had agreed to take a 60 percent stake in a rival trading platform, Turquoise, and that it planned to create a pan-European trading venture by merging it with one of its own units.

The new venture, which will retain the Turquoise name, will include the London exchange’s “dark pools” trading platform Baikal Global. Dark pools are trading platforms where banks, hedge funds and institutional investors can trade large blocks of shares in secret.

Existing shareholders in Turquoise will own 40 percent of the new company.

The London exchange said it had agreed to finance the venture for the first two years, and expected to incur additional costs of up to £20 million ($32.3 million) in the current year to restructure and integrate the operations.

The exchange added that it intended to bring in other investors by selling up to a further 9 percent of the business.

“The European marketplace for trading securities has the scope to become more efficient and to grow significantly in the coming years,” the chief executive of the London exchange, Xavier Rolet, said.

“Turquoise’s existing pan-European footprint is a strong proposition, and together with the introduction of new trading technology and a neutral structure, we believe it is now well positioned to be an agent of change and to capture a healthy slice of the market’s growth potential.”
824 2009-12-22 Stocks rose on Monday, erasing last week’s losses, as analysts recommended companies from Alcoa to Intel. Health care shares also surged after Congress delayed a new tax in the proposed industry overhaul.

Alcoa, the aluminum producer, rallied 7.9 percent after Morgan Stanley lifted its rating on the company to overweight on speculation that metal prices would keep rallying.

Intel added 2.3 percent as Barclays analysts said shares of the computer chip maker were cheap. Cigna and Aetna advanced at least 3.9 percent as legislation calling for sweeping overhaul of the health care system survived a crucial test vote.

“Every day that the legislation gets watered down and they pull more teeth, the health care stocks rally because there is going to be less damage to their profits,” said Scott R. Tapley, a portfolio manager at 1st Source Investment Advisors in South Bend, Ind. “As we get more clarity, it’s easier to have more confidence about the valuations for these stocks.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 1.05 percent, or 11.58 points, to 1,114.05 for the biggest gain in three weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 85.25 points, or 0.83 percent, to close 10,414.14. The Nasdaq rose 25.97 points, or 1.17 percent, to end at 2,237.66.

840 2009-12-23 The Boeing Company said Tuesday it acquired the remaining half of a venture that joins sections of the fuselage of the 787 Dreamliner from Finmeccanica of Italy, giving it greater control over the jet’s assembly.

The facility, near Charleston, S.C., “is critical to the success of the 787 program,” James F. Albaugh, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement. The company did not disclose financial details.

Boeing originally acquired half of the operation, Global Aeronautica, in June 2008.
841 2009-12-23 Now he delights in attacking another man he ran against and lost to: a new Democratic president who had once hoped, based on McCain’s past positions, that his former Republican rival might be of help in such areas as the economy, national security, immigration and climate change.

With President Obama, McCain’s objections seem motivated more by vendetta than principle.

He angrily turned on his former base, the news media, during his campaign when his lame performance on the economy and his irresponsible choice of Sarah Palin got panned.

In 2000, McCain would devilishly point out Tom Brokaw or a Times journalist to town hall audiences as “one of the last Trotskyites, left-wing, Communist, pinkos of the American media.”

In 2008, he snarled to political aides about journalists whom he had once admired, like Brokaw and Charlie Gibson, and he cut off The Times completely. He talks about the media betrayal with the same outsize scorn that he once reserved for his Viet Cong captors.

The famous twinkle is gone, replaced by an infamous bitterness.

After his 2008 race against Obama — a campaign that too often took the low road in toadying to the right and painting Obama as a socialist and terrorist fellow-traveler — the capital eagerly waited to see which McCain would return to the Capitol.

Would McCain be the new lion of the Senate, putting “Country First” for a historic final chapter to his long career? Or would he morph into the sort of knee-jerk Congressional partisan he had once loathed?

Sadly, despite the scary trellis of problems America faces, the unorthodox, brave and cheeky McCain failed to show up.

Part of his sharp turn to the right may be motivated by his primary challenge for a fifth term from J.D. Hayworth, a conservative, anti-immigration talk-show host and former Republican House member (who has also been anti-Times at times).

But he has said himself that it’s more about philosophical differences with President Obama.

Unlike his pal Lindsey Graham, who voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor, McCain seemed motivated by revenge when he voted against Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee.

“An excellent résumé and an inspiring life story are not enough to qualify one for a lifetime of service on the Supreme Court,” McCain sniffed.

McCain, who once led the fight in the Senate with his pal Joe Lieberman on enacting a global warming bill, shocked many when he flipped on the issue, attacking climate legislation supported by Lieberman, Graham and John Kerry.

McCain has also descended into demagoguery on Medicare. Although he has been in favor of Medicare reductions to cut the deficit over years, he’s now adopted a rigid hands-off Medicare stance.

He rejected the idea of being a point man on immigration in the Senate, apparently preferring to stew.

A couple of times, during floor speeches on health care this month, the Arizona senator noted “that a fight not joined is a fight not enjoyed.”

It seemed to be an inadvertent recognition that he was fighting for the sake of it, not to help the country get past some of the hideous problems left by the man McCain failed to stop in 2000.

Maybe an excellent résumé and an inspiring life story are not enough to qualify one as a real statesman.
842 2009-12-23 As I listened to ’s minister of economic and business affairs describe how her country used higher energy to stimulate innovation in green power and then recycled the tax revenues back to Danish industry and consumers to make it easier for them to make and buy the new clean technologies, it all sounded so, well, intelligent. It sounded as if the Danes looked at themselves after the 1973 Arab embargo, found that they were totally dependent on oil and put in place a long-term strategy to make Denmark energy-secure and start a new industry at the same time.

The more I listened to the Danish minister, Lene Espersen, the more I thought of my own country, where I’ve been told time and again by U.S. politicians that proposing even a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes to make America more energy independent and to stimulate is “off the table,” an act of sure political .

Not in Denmark. So I asked the Danish minister: “Tell me, what planet are you people from?”

Espersen laughed. But I didn’t. How long are we Americans going to go on thinking that we can thrive in the 21st century when doing the optimal things — whether for energy, health care, education or the deficit — are “off the table.” They’ve been banished by an ad hoc coalition of lobbyists loaded with money, loud-mouth talk-show hosts who will flame anyone who crosses them, political consultants who warn that asking Americans to do anything important but hard makes one unelectable and a citizenry that doesn’t even ask for optimal anymore because it believes that optimal is impossible.

Sorry, but there are no good ideas proven to work in other democratic/capitalist societies that we can afford to shove off our table — not when we need to build a knowledge economy with good jobs and everyone else is trying to do the same.

“Already the green taxes here are quite high,” said Espersen. “And even though we know this is not popular with business and industry, it has made all the difference for us. It forced our businesses to become more energy efficient and innovative, and this meant that, suddenly, we were inventing things nobody else was inventing because our businesses needed to be competitive.”

The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a nonpartisan research center, and the Embassy of Denmark recently held a briefing on how Denmark is working to become a low-carbon economy. Here are some highlights:

Although it still generates the majority of its electricity from coal, “since 1990, Denmark has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 14 percent. Over the same time frame, Danish energy consumption has stayed constant and Denmark’s gross domestic product has grown by more than 40 percent. Denmark is the most energy efficient country in the E.U.; due to carbon pricing, through energy taxes, carbon taxes, the ‘ ’ system, strict building codes and energy labeling programs. Renewable resources currently supply almost 30 percent of Denmark’s electricity. is the largest source of renewable electricity, followed by biomass. ... Today, puts only 3 percent of its waste into landfills and incinerates 39 percent to generate electricity for thousands of households.”

The Danish government funnels energy tax revenue “back to industry, earmarking much of it to subsidize environmental innovation,” wrote Monica Prasad, a faculty fellow at ’s Institute for Policy Research, in a March 25, 2008, essay in this newspaper. Therefore, “Danish firms are pushed away from carbon and pulled into environmental innovation, and the country’s economy isn’t put at a competitive disadvantage.”
843 2009-12-23 In the home stretch of the crucial holiday shopping season, many retailers are scrambling to make up for lost sales after winter storms over the weekend kept consumers away from stores.

The Saturday before Christmas is typically among the busiest shopping days of the year, but early figures from that day suggest that heavy snow and fierce winds in the Northeast and Midwest significantly hurt sales.

Sales for the industry declined 12.6 percent on Saturday compared with the same day last year, according to ShopperTrak, a research firm. The group said on Tuesday that customer traffic at malls fell 12.4 percent year-over-year. However the picture for the entire weekend, Friday through Sunday, was much better: sales declined just 2.1 percent from a year ago, indicating that some consumers still shopped before and after the snowfall.

The Saturday sales decline was the largest ShopperTrak had seen since it began reporting the data in 2002, according to Bill Martin, the company’s co-founder. The steepest declines were in the Northeast, where the weather contributed to a sales drop of 17.3 percent. Still, sales fell in every part of the country, even the West — suggesting that snowstorms were not the only factor keeping shoppers at home. What remains to be seen is whether consumers are simply procrastinating or if they have cut back on holiday gifts more radically than industry professionals expected.

Also on Tuesday, the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, confirmed that sales on Saturday fell by double digits from a year ago, though the week’s sales pace benefited from some consumers shopping ahead of the blizzard.

Just how badly retail sales were hurt on Saturday will not be known for sure until early January, when individual chains report their December sales results.
844 2009-12-23 The Knicks did not trail after Deng opened the game with a layup, but they teetered heavily on their way to a win. Rose’s two layups and Noah’s turnaround hook brought the Bulls to 80-79 after the Knicks led, 53-31, at halftime.

Chris Duhon missed a point-blank layup, but Lee corralled the loose ball and made both of his free throws after being fouled by Noah to give the Knicks a 3-point lead.

Rose and Deng followed by missing jumpers, but the Bulls were granted renewed life when Jared Jeffries missed two free throws with 31.8 seconds left. Rose, however, threw the ball away, and Lee converted a 17-foot jumper with 5.5 seconds remaining.

“We were all over the place and they weren’t making shots as well, but I think a lot of it has to do with us challenging shots they took,” Duhon said. “We weren’t really giving them any second-chance opportunities and were just making it very difficult for them.”

The Knicks held their eighth consecutive opponent below 100 points. They last held that many opponents below 100 during a nine-game stretch in November 2005.

When the Knicks struggled to a 1-9 start, only one opponent — the Utah Jazz — scored less than 100 points. They are playing at a slower tempo now and scoring less. So are their opponents.

“The things that we are solid with are guys are talking on defense, we are long, there is some good stuff that we really can’t teach, and this other stuff we should be able to iron out,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said.

The Knicks’ performance against the Bulls was a likely mixture of their defensive effort and Chicago’s woes. The Bulls presented Lee with a rebounder’s haven, missing shot after shot. Lee collected 21 rebounds, 16 defensive, and had 18 points. Al Harrington scored a team-high 20 points, helping to compensate for Danilo Gallinari’s 2-for-13 shooting.

The Bulls (10-17) began wearily after Monday’s loss, increasing talk that Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro’s job security was tenuous.

“That’s tough,” D’Antoni said before the game. “We all know there are big swings in the N.B.A. so it does happen, but 35 is a little bit over the top. Once a team gets on a roll, it’s tough.”

The Knicks and the Bulls could attest to that Tuesday. Each made only 34 shots, and after holding the Bulls to 31 points in the first half, the Knicks scored only 35 in the second half.

Deng scored 6 points in the first quarter, while Chicago’s other starters went 0 for 10 in the span. Harrington hit a long jumper as the second quarter expired, providing the Knicks with a 22-point lead, their largest of the evening.

Del Negro exchanged Kirk Hinrich and Taj Gibson for John Salmons and Brad Miller in the third quarter, prompting a surge from Rose. Rose scored 16 of his 26 points in the third quarter when the Bulls outscored the Knicks, 25-15.

Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said that he communicated with Aaron Goodwin, Nate Robinson’s agent, over a trade request. Walsh said the sides agreed not to discuss their discussions in the news media. Robinson did not play for the 10th straight game. ... Jonathan Bender sustained a bruised hip in the second quarter and did not return to the game. ... Larry Hughes played after missing three games with a strained left groin muscle and scored 4 points in 17 minutes.
845 2009-12-23 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Tuesday dismissed the West’s year-end deadline for Iran to accept a deal to ship much of its nuclear fuel abroad for processing. “Who are they to set us a deadline?” he said in a televised speech in Shiraz. “We set them a deadline that if they do not correct their attitude and behavior and literature, we will demand from them the Iranian nation’s historic rights.”
846 2009-12-23 The Iranian opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi has been dismissed as the head of Iran’s art institution, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday. Mr. Moussavi, who came in second to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential election in June, had run the state-financed institution since its founding 11 years ago. He was dismissed by the Council for Cultural Revolution, a body that Mr. Ahmadinejad serves on as chairman. Mr. Moussavi appeared Monday at a funeral for a prominent dissident cleric in the holy city of Qum that turned into a huge opposition rally.
847 2009-12-23 The audits were the latest blows to New York’s troubled Medicaid system, which is both the most expensive in the country and one that earns consistently low ratings in terms of health care quality.

Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health care for indigent people.

In a series of audits over the last three years, Mr. DiNapoli’s office has identified roughly $400 million in improper payments, for services including home care for dead people and a dentist’s charges for patients who lived hundreds of miles away.

Mr. DiNapoli’s audits on Tuesday cited at least $5.4 million in improper payments to 10 hospitals that had billed for discharging patients who had been transferred to another hospital. Under Medicaid rules, hospitals receive more for discharging patients than for transferring them.

One such patient was hospitalized for 18 days before being transferred. The hospital claimed he had been discharged, earning a $253,000 payment for the patient’s treatment, rather than the $92,000 it would have gotten had it reported the transfer correctly.

Mr. DiNapoli also criticized the Department of Health for seeking to recover only a small fraction of the $53 million paid to providers in claims for individuals with multiple Medicaid numbers.

The department said the improper claims highlighted in the audits amount to a tiny fraction of total Medicaid claims, which total tens of billions of dollars a year.

In a statement, Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the department, said that officials there were committed to preventing Medicaid waste, but disputed some of the audits’ conclusions.

The taxi rides were provided to the Poughkeepsie woman, Ms. Hutton said, because her son’s doctor had determined that she should be trained to provide home care for her son after he was released, training that would cost taxpayers less than a professional home health aide.

Ms. Hutton also said that it was not clear whether individuals with two Medicaid numbers had caused the state to be billed twice for the same services. In cases in which providers had provided legitimate services to patients, she said, the state had an obligation to reimburse them.

“Not all claims are as simple as the comptroller portrays them, and the route to recoup the funds is likewise complex,” Ms. Hutton said. “Nevertheless, we appreciate the auditors’ efforts to identify improvements.”
848 2009-12-23 SAN FRANCISCO — It was the week before Christmas when Irv Sutley, a former warehouse worker, first saw the offending ornament in a government building in Sonoma County, just north of here.

“I was turning around in the lobby, and I noticed the tree,” Mr. Sutley said. “And then, I noticed the angel.”

Mr. Sutley, an atheist, said he then went to the office of the county Board of Supervisors. “And there was a star,” he said.

Technically, neither stars nor angels belong to any particular religion. But to the mind of Mr. Sutley, 65, a veteran who has fought to keep religion out of public meetings and buildings, the symbolism was clear.

“For most people, a star atop a tree at this time of season represents the star of Bethlehem, which is a cult symbol, the cult being Christianity,” he said, adding that the government should be neutral on religion.

Sonoma County officials conferred with their lawyers, and on Monday the acting county administrator, Chris Thomas, asked county departments to remove stars, angels or any other religious symbols “so that we can celebrate the season yet not appear to endorse Christian or other religious doctrines.”
849 2009-12-23 On a day when the Yankees acquired the Atlanta Braves’ ace, Javier Vazquez, to be their No. 4 starter, the Mets neared a deal with a converted knuckleballer who is missing a ligament in his right elbow.

The Mets are on the verge of signing R. A. Dickey, who spent last season in the Minnesota Twins’ organization, to a minor league contract, according to a baseball official with knowledge of their plans. He was granted anonymity because the deal has not been completed.

A first-round pick of the Texas Rangers in 1996, Dickey, 35, may be the only pitcher in professional baseball who does not have an ulnar collateral ligament, the tissue replaced during Tommy John surgery. He was born without one, or, unbeknownst to him, the ligament disintegrated as he grew up.

When the ligament’s absence was discovered after he was drafted during an examination by Texas’ team physician, Dickey defied doctors’ expectations by advancing steadily through the Rangers’ system and reaching the majors in 2001.

A string of poor performances prompted Dickey to reinvent himself as a knuckleballer in 2005, and it was not until he joined the Seattle Mariners in 2008 that he received an extended opportunity. On June 24 at Shea Stadium that season, Dickey pitched seven shutout innings in a victory against the Mets.
850 2009-12-23 The zoo’s director was dismissed last year by Kiev’s eccentric mayor, Leonid M. Chernovetsky, after failing to find a mate for an elephant — or so Mr. Chernovetsky said. The new director has stirred an uproar among the staff for her supposedly tyrannical ways, and in October, a brawl erupted among workers during a celebration of the zoo’s centennial.

Lately, animal rights advocates, including Ms. Shvets, have contended that the zoo’s distress has been orchestrated by top city officials who want to sell the zoo’s choice urban real estate to developers and move the animals to the suburbs. The advocates call the strategy, “No animal, no problem,” a play on Stalin’s infamous saying, “No person, no problem.”

“This is being done so there are less and less animals, and they can make money from the land,” said Ms. Shvets, 60, a retired government worker. “The authorities in Kiev these days, all they care about is money.”

The troubles are not always immediately obvious. During a walk around the zoo on a Saturday morning, the place seemed more shabby than squalid, as if it once aspired to great-zoo status but had fallen on hard times for lack of money and attention.

Still, advocates said the worst conditions were obscured behind closed doors, and they have circulated photographs that they said revealed how the animals were treated out of sight.

Many of the primates and bears are held in claustrophobic quarters because the public enclosures are run-down, they said. Construction was begun on a primate pavilion at great cost, then abandoned last year. Workers tell visitors that most monkeys are “under quarantine.”

“I really cried when I went inside and saw the conditions for the monkeys,” said Tamara Tarnawska, leader of SOS-Animals Kiev. “It was absolutely horrible. I felt ashamed to be human.” She said the animals were crammed together in cages that were poorly lighted and dirty.

The zoo’s management disputed many of the criticisms, saying that they were voiced by disgruntled former workers or outsiders with no expertise. The zoo’s director, Svetlana Berzina, did acknowledge that the zoo was in bad shape when she took over last year. She said the previous management was incompetent and had begun projects that were expensive, unnecessary and never finished, like the primate pavilion.

Ms. Berzina said she was replacing workers, spearheading renovations, bringing in consultants and establishing a code of ethics.

“We are consistently dealing with all these issues,” she said. “But I think that you can understand that problems that accumulated over decades cannot be resolved in a single year.”

“A significant number of workers at the zoo clearly were not doing their jobs, and many were simply drinking heavily on the job,” she added. Ms. Berzina denied that there were plans to sell the zoo’s land, and she called publicity over the fight at the zoo’s celebration in October overblown, saying that it was provoked by former workers.

City officials said they hoped to improve the zoo enough to have it reinstated to the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, but the association said the zoo would have to wait at least until 2012.

While conflicts over the zoo have been widely publicized, some visitors said they did not see what all the fuss was about.

“Compared to other zoos I’ve been to, the animals live pretty well here,” said Aleksei Nazarenko, 22. “There are all these zoos that travel from city to city in Ukraine, and the animals live pretty poorly there. Here, they seem O.K.”

But Yelena Ryabova, 55, said she was worried that the zoo would be relocated.

“They want to put it 40 kilometers away,” she said, referring to the persistent rumors. (Forty kilometers is about 25 miles.) “That is a long way to go.”

When Ms. Shvets overheard people saying that the animals seemed fine, she shook her head. She said that in her many years of coming to the zoo, things had never been so unsettling. During Soviet times, the zoo’s facilities might have been relatively spare, but the care was far better, she said.

Now, she noted, signs were out of date, animals were mysteriously missing and the zoo was pocked with deserted renovation sites.

And then she stalked off to do some more snooping.

“Where is the hippopotamus?” she demanded of a worker, standing at the edge of an empty outdoor enclosure.

“When the mayor gives us money for repairs, you can see the hippopotamus,” the worker grumbled.

Ms. Shvets located the forlorn animal in a small pen elsewhere. “Good morning, my darling!” she said.
851 2009-12-23 MOSCOW — The prime minister of Lithuania, a former Soviet republic that broke from Moscow’s orbit and is now a member of NATO, accused the United States on Tuesday of using “Soviet methods” to set up two secret prisons in Lithuania for terrorism suspects.

The prime minister, Andrius Kubilius, said the United States had reached what he contended were clandestine and illegal arrangements with the Lithuanian secret services for prisons that were outside civilian control.

Mr. Kubilius made his remarks on the day that the national security committee in the Lithuanian Parliament released a report that determined that the country was the site of two small secret prisons, though it did not indicate how they were used.

The report was based on testimony from politicians and national security officials. It was initiated after ABC News described Lithuania’s role in hosting so-called black sites, and other questions were raised about its activities in the fight against terrorism.

Arvydas Anusauskas, chairman of the national security committee, said state security officials “received requests from the C.I.A. to establish detention facilities.”

He said it was not clear who was housed in the facilities because five planes that apparently transported people to Lithuania were never inspected by civilian officials.
852 2009-12-23 For some reason, the comic-book character Tintin, beloved just about everywhere else, has never quite caught on in America. This may change in 2011, when Steven Spielberg brings the first of three planned Tintin adventures to the movie screen, but for now he remains underappreciated  a little too odd and earnest, perhaps, in a landscape ruled by superheroes.

Tintin, a virginal, 15-year-old journalist with a perpetually upswept quiff of reddish-blond hair and a wire-haired fox terrier named Snowy, is the hero of 23 book-length adventures  what we now call graphic novels  completed by the Belgian artist Hergé, who died in 1983 at the age of 75. Most of them are little masterpieces of the form, combining inventive and suspenseful comic storytelling with drawings that are clear, precise and as thrilling as movie stills. Andy Warhol was a big fan, and so was Roy Lichtenstein.

Regrettably, though Pierre Assouline summarizes the books in great detail, his biography of their creator, “Hergé: The Man Who Created Tintin,” is unillustrated, so if you don’t already know the work, this is not the place to start. And even if you do, the story is a little depressing. Hergé here is frequently reminiscent of the Charles Schulz depicted in David Michaelis’s recent biography: an artist far happier and more interesting in his work than he ever was in life. Mr. Assouline, a journalist and film producer who has also written a biography of Georges Simenon, manages to misspell Schulz’s name and also that of the great Winsor McCay, creator of Little Nemo, but is generally judicious and fair, determined to make his subject sympathetic. Ultimately, though, he reveals far more about Hergé’s publishing life and business affairs than about what made him tick.

Hergé was born Georges Remi in May 1907. (The pen name came from flipping his initials, as pronounced in French: RG.) He grew up in Brussels and led a life of almost comic Belgian blandness until as a teenager he came under the sway of Norbert Wallez, a right-wing Roman Catholic priest who idolized Mussolini. Wallez encouraged Hergé’s drawing and got him a job with the children’s section of Le Vingtième Siècle, a conservative Catholic paper that Wallez edited. He shaped Hergé’s thinking, eventually chose a wife for him, and even suggested that for Tintin’s first adventure  “Tintin in the Land of the Soviets” (1930)  Hergé dispatch his hero to Russia so he could expose the evils of Bolshevism.

Tintin’s next mission was to the Congo, where he preached the virtues of King Leopold’s colonialism. The drawings in this volume, “Tintin in the Congo,” were so appallingly racist that Hergé later redid them, though not entirely removing a hint of condescension. He also redid a later book, “The Shooting Star,” removing anti-Semitic details like a villain named Blumenstein and two panels in which characters named Isaac and Salomon look forward to the end of the world because it means they won’t have to pay their bills.

Though Hergé later repented, and brought to his best work an almost reportorial accuracy, accusations of racism and anti-Semitism never entirely went away. Even more problematic was his conduct during World War II when, unlike many Belgians who refused to have anything to do with the Nazi occupiers, Hergé went to work for Le Soir, which had become pro-German. (This was the same paper for which the distinguished literary critic Paul de Man, then a young man, wrote anti-Semitic articles.) After the war Hergé, whose work flourished in Le Soir, was arrested four times on charges of collaboration and avoided prosecution only by entering into a convenient business alliance with some former members of the Resistance.

Mr. Assouline suggests that Hergé was less a traitor than a self-involved obsessive for whom continuing Tintin was more important than anything else. Unlike P. G. Wodehouse, who was also accused of collaboration during the war, Hergé wasn’t an innocent, exactly, but to the end of his life he never accepted that he had done anything wrong or understood why so many of his countrymen resented him. “I worked, period; that’s all,” he said, defending himself. “Just like a miner works, or a streetcar ticket taker, or a baker.”

In the postwar years, when he published most of the best Tintin adventures, Hergé, depressed, overworked, drinking heavily and still smarting from criticism, had several breakdowns, disappearing for weeks at a time. He and his wife (who once admitted that Wallez was more her type) grew apart and in an effort to repair things adopted a child. After just two weeks, though, Hergé couldn’t stand the disruption and had the boy sent back. He began to stray from rigid Catholicism, becoming interested in Eastern philosophy, and eventually fell in love with a woman almost 30 years his junior, with whom he lived for 17 years before finally getting a divorce and marrying her.

In this, too  the depressions, the religious questioning, the relatively happy second marriage  he resembles Charles Schulz, and like Schulz he enjoyed a late mellowing. In the 1960s, with most of his best work behind him, he openly admired, among other cartoonists, Johnny Hart and even R. Crumb, whose sexual frankness didn’t put him off at all. Now wealthy, he became an art collector, buying Rothko, Rauschenberg and Lichtenstein, and even took up painting himself, finishing, Mr. Assouline says, some 37 abstract canvases (here again, one wishes for photographs) before abruptly putting down his brush and returning to Tintin.

As Mr. Assouline readily admits, next to Tintin’s life, Hergé’s was a dim shadow, of interest mostly for the way it reminds us, yet again, that there is no accounting for genius. Hergé wrote to his first wife after one of his breakdowns, “Tintin has been for me the means to express myself, to project my desire for adventure and violence, the bravery and resourcefulness within me,” and yet in the end the character seems less a projection of Hergé’s inner self than the repression of it. What makes Tintin so appealing is that he never grows up and has no inner life at all.
853 2009-12-23 Newton, a brainy and self-assured city of 83,000, is mired in budget woes, not least because of a project the state treasurer has tartly labeled a Taj Mahal: a new state-of-the-art high school whose price is approaching $200 million due to its complex design and unexpectedly high construction costs.

Good schools are by far the top priority here, but the project’s spiraling cost — the highest ever for a Massachusetts public school — has outraged even the staunchest supporters of education spending. Mr. Warren may have to raise taxes or cut services to help pay for the high school.

“He’s not naïve about the potential jam he’s in,” said Dan Payne, a Democratic consultant and longtime Newton resident. “But he’s convinced he can harness the talents of the citizenry and make the city function smoothly again.”

Mr. Warren’s father is an administrator at Northeastern University who worked for former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee. His mother, now retired, was a social worker. He worked on Mr. Clinton’s advance team and in the White House social office, ran the New England division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and served as deputy state director for Senator John Kerry, who was a groomsman in Mr. Warren’s wedding.

While serving a year in Iraq as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve, Mr. Warren decided to return to his roots.

“It just affirmed and reinforced my belief in public service,” Mr. Warren said of his deployment. “What I feel most passionate about is making people’s lives better, and I wanted to do it right here in my own community — particularly after experiencing Iraq.”

He lives in his childhood home with his wife, Tassy, who works on child development at Harvard, and their year-old daughter, Abigail. He announced his candidacy after returning from Iraq in October 2008, then introduced himself to Newton voters by knocking on more than 11,000 doors.

“There’s no doubt people wanted to change the direction the city was going in,” said Mr. Warren, who coincidentally ended up with about 11,000 votes — 463 more than his opponent and fellow Democrat, State Representative Ruth B. Balser. “But I also think that my direct contact with people was one of the major reasons for my success.”

He ran on the premise that Newton’s stellar reputation was slipping because of mismanagement — a message that apparently shook voters who had paid top dollar to buy homes and raise children here. He wants to generate revenue by seeking larger payments in lieu of taxes from local nonprofit institutions, like Boston College, and curtailing the cost of health benefits for city employees and retirees, which he said were growing by 11 percent annually.

Mr. Warren said the high school project, whose price has nearly doubled since 2003 and comes out to more than $100,000 per student, had been “completely mismanaged.” Voters protested last year, rejecting a plan to override a cap on property tax increases; many still resent the project and the bad publicity it has drawn.

“People here want the schools to be first rate,” Mr. Payne said, “but they don’t necessarily want the school buildings to be the most expensive in America.”

There are no term limits here, and the outgoing mayor — David Cohen, who did not seek re-election amid the high school controversy — has served since 1998. Mr. Warren hinted he was planning on at least two terms.

“It’s really going to take a chief executive six or eight years to move this city in the right direction,” he said.

He started this month by firing Mr. Cohen’s entire executive staff and several other officials.

Mr. Patrick, who took Mr. Warren to lunch shortly after the election, advised him to engage the broadest possible spectrum of constituents, including those who had opposed his candidacy.

“With this economic environment, it’s tough to gain consensus on any level,” Mr. Warren said. “He encouraged me to really reach out to as many people as I can.”

In a place like Newton — replete with academics, psychiatrists and other overachievers — that could be dangerous, Mr. Payne said.

“Everyone here thinks they’re an expert,” he said, citing residents who built their own architectural models to challenge the design of the new high school. “There are no people here who just say, ‘I’ll leave it up to City Hall.’ ”

“It’s not going to be easy,” he said. “But I think the test of good, strong leadership is tapping into that talent and being able to maximize it.”

855 2009-12-23 Eric Asimov wanted fried chicken with his Champagne. The acidity and fizz in good Champagne are the perfect foil for the crisp and greasy allure of fried food. Like wearing Gucci with Gap, Champagne can work well with everyday food.

If fried chicken is not what I’d serve during the holiday season, local fresh Peconic Bay scallops or Nantuckets, now in season, certainly are. At $20 or more a pound, they may be a little more Gucci than chicken, but they are a worthwhile treat. Quartered sea scallops can be substituted.

With strips of sweet peppers, all are battered and fried as a first course or a platter to pass with flutes of aperitif Champagne.
856 2009-12-23 SEATTLE (AP) — A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling on Tuesday and ordered Microsoft to stop selling its Word program in January and pay a Canadian software company $290 million for violating a patent.

But Microsoft said it expected the decision to have little impact on Word or Microsoft’s Office package in the United States. Microsoft said Tuesday that new versions, with the computer code in question removed, would be ready for sale when the injunction begins Jan. 11.

The case started in 2007, when the software company, i4i Inc. of Toronto, sued Microsoft, saying it owned the technology behind a tool that gives Word users an improved way to edit XML, or code that tells the program how to interpret and display a document’s contents.

A Texas jury found that Microsoft Word willfully infringed on the patent.
857 2009-12-23 BEIJING — Chinese officials, stung by criticism in the West that China had sabotaged a legally binding agreement for reducing greenhouse gases during talks in Copenhagen, fired back on Tuesday, saying that wealthy nations were seeking to sow discord among developing countries in a cynical attempt to avoid reducing their own emissions.

In comments made to the state-run media, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman took umbrage at the assertions made by Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for energy and climate change, who said that Beijing had thwarted the passage of an ironclad agreement last week.

Mr. Miliband, in an article published Sunday in The Guardian, accused China of scuttling a proposal that would have reduced global emissions by 50 percent by 2050 with developed countries pledging to reduce climate-warming pollution by 80 percent over the same period.

“The last two weeks at times have presented a farcical picture to the public,” he wrote. “We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked in this way.”

Although she did not identify Mr. Miliband by name, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said “an individual British politician” sought to avoid the obligations of developed nations by sowing discord among poorer countries. The attempt, she said, was doomed to fail.

“We urge them to correct mistakes, fulfill their obligations to developing countries in an earnest way, and stay away from activities that hinder the international community,” she said.

859 2009-12-24 For the last month, the Pentagon has dispatched scores of psychologists, therapists and chaplains to counsel soldiers and their families, and bolster the post’s chronically understaffed mental health network. It has overseen the creation of a new system of trauma counseling. And it has pledged to speed the hiring of dozens of permanent new mental health specialists.

But the stepped-up efforts, while welcomed even by critics of the Army’s record in dealing with combat-related stress, are also seen as a test of its resolve to break with the past. Making change stick remains a challenge not just for Fort Hood, but the entire Army, as it struggles to improve care for its rising tide of deployment-strained soldiers.

Already, many of the therapists newly dispatched here have left; when all are gone, the post will need at least 40 more, General Cone said. Over all, the Army is short about 800 behavioral health specialists, Pentagon officials say.

Even more daunting will be fighting the ostracism and stigma faced by many soldiers who admit problems.

Although most of his commanders support their troubled soldiers, the general said, “Occasionally what you get is a leader who fails.”

In Specialist Jasinski’s case, one of his commanding officers told the soldier’s mother recently that he did not believe Specialist Jasinski had P.T.S.D., Mr. Branum and the mother said. Since then, doctors have checked the specialist into Fort Hood’s mental ward, concerned that he was suicidal.

Getting soldiers to use Fort Hood’s expanding array of support services — most of which opened not long before Nov. 5 — can be difficult. Many soldiers remain unaware of the family therapy and round-the-clock chaplain counseling in a “spiritual fitness center,” a chaplain said.

A three-week soldier “reset” program uses cranial massage, yoga and acupuncture to alleviate the hyper-vigilance that accompanies the stress disorder, but the program is limited to 16 soldiers at a time.

And General Cone, a West Point graduate who took command here in late September, has maintained a policy started by his predecessor that requires commanders to let their units go home by 3 p.m. on Thursdays and prohibits weekend training, unless he approves it. But complaints abound about extended hours and duties that require soldiers to bring work home.

It is too soon to say whether more soldiers are taking advantage of Fort Hood’s expanded services. But several said the programs helped them cope with the shootings.

“There are a lot of things the Army did to get us through this,” said Lt. Col. Pete Andrysiak, commander of the 20th Engineering Battalion. The battalion, which leaves for Afghanistan early next year, lost more soldiers, four, in last month’s rampage than any other unit.

But critics says the services will prove little more than cosmetic if not made available to more people. Specialist Jasinski may provide a case study.

Specialist Jasinski, 23, who enlisted after high school in 2005, spent 15 months in Diyala Province north of Baghdad. The experience changed him, his family said. A friend was killed; another lost a limb. While serving in an intelligence unit, he said, he collected data used in airstrikes that killed many Iraqis, perhaps including civilians.

After returning home in late 2007, he struggled with depression, excessive drinking and bouts of anger and crying. A doctor told him he had P.T.S.D. and, records show, prescribed antidepressants. Still, he thought he could make it to February 2009, when he was eligible for an honorable discharge.

But in the fall of 2008, Specialist Jasinski learned that the Army had involuntarily extended his tour, scheduling his unit to return to Iraq in 2009. And despite his having the stress disorder, the Army expected him to go.

On the day he was to return to Fort Hood from leave last December, he spent 14 hours in his parents’ living room staring out a window and muttering, “I’d rather die than go back.” His parents told him to stay.

“It’s not about Eric being a coward,” said his mother, Laura Barrett, 46, a counselor’s assistant at a high school in Jonesboro, Ark. “He’s a strong man. And he was intelligent enough to know he could not do it again. He would hurt himself. He might hurt someone else.”

This November, after he spent a year stacking inventory at a big box store, his parents urged him to return to Fort Hood, and he agreed. “The stress of being away without leave and not knowing if I was going to be picked up was an extreme mental drain, every day,” Specialist Jasinski said in a recent interview.

Officials at Fort Hood declined to discuss his case.

Dr. Adam Borah, chief of the resilience and restoration center at the post’s Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, said soldiers with P.T.S.D. are occasionally deployed when their illness seems under control. But some people are deployed because the disorder is not spotted.

“There are still holes in the system,” he said.

General Cone has helped other troubled soldiers, as well as Specialist Jasinski, said Chuck Luther, the founder of an advocacy group, Disposable Warriors. But the general is to deploy to Iraq in March, leaving behind his deputy to oversee Fort Hood for a year. Mr. Luther and other advocates worry that mental health programs will suffer.

General Cone insisted that would not happen. He noted that by the time he leaves, 85 percent of Fort Hood’s soldiers would be home from war, the highest percentage in years. “It happens at a good time for us because, frankly, we need that kind of positive environment,” he said.
860 2009-12-24 Animation is, at heart, the simplest form of cinema: a flutter of drawings fooling the eye into seeing motion. Nowadays, at least at feature length, the form tends to be a much bigger deal, with every year bringing can-you-top-this spectacles full of noisy, shiny figures and images.

“Sita Sings the Blues,” Nina Paley’s new film, which arrives in New York on Friday trailing festival love, is certainly ambitious and visually loaded. There are songs, bright colors and a story taken in part from one of the biggest, oldest epics in the world. But it is also modest, personal and, in spite of Ms. Paley’s use of digital vector graphic techniques, decidedly handmade. A Pixar or DreamWorks extravaganza typically concludes with a phone book’s worth of technical credits. Ms. Paley did everything in “Sita” — an amazingly eclectic, 82-minute tour de force — by herself.

Well, she didn’t sing the songs. Instead, she selected recordings from the early jazz singer Annette Hanshaw, whose voice, poised between heartbreak and soigné resignation, sets a mood of longing for this multilayered tale of love gone wrong. This music also provides an unlikely but seductive accompaniment to the main story, which comes from the Ramayana, an ancient and voluminous Indian epic.

Its hero is the blue-skinned Rama, avatar of the deity Vishnu, but Ms. Paley is more interested in Sita, his wife, whose devotion becomes both a romantic inspiration and a feminist cautionary tale. Her adventures are narrated by three shadow puppets who speak in the accents of modern Indian English and who quibble over details and interpretations.

Meanwhile, Sita, Rama and other characters from the Ramayana are rendered in various styles, including a “Betty Boop Goes Bollywood” look for the musical numbers and an illuminated-manuscript manner for the dramatic scenes.

All of this is entwined with the simpler, sadder, more drably drawn chronicle of a woman named Nina, whose longtime boyfriend, Dave, takes a job in India and eventually breaks her heart. This is a stripped-down, modernized variation on what happens to Sita, whose absolute love for Rama is repaid with suspicion, a humiliating trial by fire (to test her purity) and banishment. Hanshaw, crooning after inconstant or unkind lovers, completes the picture.

872 2009-12-24 MANILA (AP) — Search-and-rescue teams combed the waters of Manila Bay on Thursday for at least 27 people missing after a passenger ferry collided with a fishing boat, the coast guard said.

At least 46 people were plucked alive from the water, and the coast guard alerted all vessels in the area to look for others, said a spokesman, Armand Balilo.

The ferry was carrying 73 people from Manila to southwest Mindoro Island, but it was not clear how many were in the fishing boat, which sank shortly after the accident, Mr. Balilo said.

The cause of the collision, at a time when millions of Filipinos were heading to their home provinces before Christmas Eve, was not clear. No weather disturbances were reported in the area.

Sea accidents are common in the archipelago due to tropical storms, badly maintained boats and weak enforcement of safety regulations.

Last year, a ferry overturned after sailing toward a powerful typhoon in the central Philippines, killing more than 800 people on board.

 Afghan Institute of Learning, , is an aid group run by Afghan women. It is led by Sakena Yacoobi, a force of nature who was educated in the , and it now serves 350,000 Afghan women and children annually.

Yacoobi runs education programs, training centers and clinics, emphasizing local buy-in and self-reliance. Western aid programs in have not always been successful, and my hunch is that if more aid had been routed through Afghan-managed programs like this, more would have been accomplished.

874 2009-12-24 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Chevron Corporation will pay $45.5 million to resolve claims that it underpaid natural gas royalties to the government and to Native Americans, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Most of the settlement money will be distributed to federal, state and American Indian accounts affected by the underpayments. More than $12.3 million of the amount will go to the heirs of the whistle-blower who filed the lawsuit in Texarkana, Tex.

Each month, companies are required to report to the Interior Department the value of the natural gas produced from their federal and Indian leases. A percentage of the reported value is paid as royalties.

The settlement includes Chevron companies Texaco, the Unocal Corporation and other affiliates.

The government contended that the companies made improper deductions from royalty values and violated the False Claims Act by underpaying the royalties.

In a statement, Chevron denied any improper or fraudulent actions and said it settled the case to end “a long and expensive legal proceeding.”

The settlement said the underreporting took place from March 1988 through November 2008.

The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, C. Cary Patterson, of Texarkana, said many defendants remain in the case.
875 2009-12-24 Immigration authorities accused a California pastor of helping foreigners fraudulently obtain student visas and of handing out phony diplomas at a fake graduation ceremony on a campus where they never attended class. The pastor, Samuel Chai Cho Oh, 65, faces a charge of conspiracy to commit visa fraud for allegedly charging foreigners cash to help get them student visas on the premise that they would attend the Christian university he owns in Fullerton. But more than 100 students from countries including South Korea and Japan never took classes at California Union University, which served as a shell for them to stay in the country legally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. The authorities said Mr. Oh received $40,000 to $50,000 a month in the scheme. Adriaan F. van der Capellen, Mr. Oh’s lawyer, said his client was not guilty.

877 2009-12-24 In a rather uncharacteristic display of humility, Apple issued a formal apology last weekend for the widespread delays in shipping its 27-inch iMac to customers.

“The new iMac has been a huge hit, and we are working hard to fulfill orders as quickly as possible,” a company statement read. “We apologize for any inconvenience or delay this may cause our customers.” The statement was published by CNET.

No word on the reason for the delays (Apple’s Web site says the machines are expected to ship in two weeks for both 27-inch models) or whether they were caused by problems with the display, which have become a popular topic on Mac forums.

Some of the problems reported include cracked screens, flickering displays and ghostly yellow tints.

A visit to an Apple store on Long Island last Sunday revealed that the 27-inch iMac, for $1,699, was available, but that the $1,999 model powered by an Intel Core i5 chip could be ordered only through the online store. STEPHEN WILLIAMS
878 2009-12-24 Freezing temperatures and snow didn’t prevent a large turnout for Early Music New York’s annual holiday concert at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on Sunday afternoon.

Male singers from this fine period ensemble, directed by Frederick Renz, offered selections from the Renaissance, including well-known songs and rarer carols and motets.

The program opened with the motet “Noël, noël,” by Antoine Busnois. (The word “noël” was first used in songs in the early 15th century.) Adhering to a Renaissance technique called fauxbourdon, in which only two of three vocal parts are notated, the singers fluidly embellished the anonymous, monophonic tune “C’était à l’heure de minuit (noël),” performed here in an arrangement by Mr. Renz.

The next section featured anonymous 15th-century English carols, including the harmonically rich “Hail Mary Full of Grace.” The lively mood of “Nowell, This Is the Salutation” contrasted with the more poignant “Lullay, Lullay.”

The program also included songs from King Henry VIII’s Book, like the motet-carol “Quid petis, o fili?” The singers were sometimes accompanied by the lute player Christopher Morrongiello, as in the carol “Grene Grow’th the Holly.” Mr. Morrongiello also offered several attractive solos.

Throughout the concert the men sang with clarity, fine intonation and an impressive blend of voices, with performers adding distinctive touches to various pieces with brief solos.
879 2009-12-24 It is a common refrain for Next Street clients, by and large established businesses with $5 million to $50 million in annual revenue.

The chief executives of these companies, which include a Boston-area moving business with as many as 400 seasonal employees, a major supplier of refurbished toner cartridges, and a manufacturer of truck batteries that meet California’s stringent new idling restrictions, report that Next Street fills a vital role for their organizations.

More than one has said that its blend of Fortune-500-level advice and access to sophisticated financing could be a solution to the small-business credit squeeze threatening to derail the economic recovery.

That is what makes Next Street intriguing: It may be the only small-business merchant bank in the country.

“We wish there were more,” said Tim Ferguson, the British-born co-founder and partner of Next Street. “And we’ve looked, but, with the exception of a few specializing in alternative energy and biotech, we haven’t found any.”

Although most people have only a vague notion of what the term means, at one time many of the dominant financial institutions in the world were merchant banks: Rothschild, M.M. Warburg, J.P. Morgan, Lazard, Hambros and Barings.

The great merchant bankers advised kings and railroad barons, bankrolled the Dutch East India Company and the California gold rush, and underwrote the bonds for North Sea oil drilling. Of that group, just Rothschild and Lazard operate in anything approaching their old form. And neither is likely to touch a client with less than half a billion dollars a year in annual revenue.

Nonetheless, to Mr. Ferguson, who started his career at Hambros, the classic merchant-banking formula of trusted advice and access to growth capital seemed to be exactly what the small businesses in his adopted country were missing.

In the summer of 2005, the banker, now 52, was serving out a noncompete agreement after a long time as senior managing director at Putnam Investments and sitting on nonprofit boards advising small businesses in working-class neighborhoods of Boston.

When he learned how many of the companies used credit cards as their capital, he called a fellow board member, Ronald L. Walker, then at Sovereign Bank and one of the most senior African-American commercial lending executives in New England, and asked what he thought about starting a small-business merchant bank and whether there would be enough clients.

“My first reaction was, ‘What’s a merchant bank?’ ” Mr. Walker said. “But my second reaction, because I ran the small-business portfolio at Sovereign, was, absolutely, there were plenty of businesses who’d be interested.”

Today, the bank lists more than 50 companies as clients. Much of its time, especially in the early stages of a relationship, is spent encouraging entrepreneurs to challenge assumptions about their operations.

“You’d be amazed at how often, when you ask a business owner what’s the most profitable area of your business, they don’t know,” Mr. Walker said. “They know what areas bring in the most revenue, but when you really break down their cost structure and profit margins, it’s a revelation.”

The merchant bank’s services, which are usually billed on a retainer ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 a month, run the gamut from big-picture strategy of the sort offered by a McKinsey & Company or Bain & Company to organizational psychology to the kind of intimate, delicate counsel usually tendered only by the closest consigliere.

Last fall, for example, Beth Williams, chief executive of Roxbury Technology, the remanufacturer of toner cartridges, called on Next Street to help her deal with the discovery that a senior executive had embezzled half a million dollars. “My first call was to my lawyer,” she said. “My second was to Next Street.”

Another client, Larry O’Toole, chief executive of Gentle Giant Moving, relied on Next Street to manage the hiring process after his longtime chief financial officer was wooed away.

“I don’t have formal financial training, so I lean heavily on my C.F.O.,” Mr. O’Toole said. “I got 70 résumés in. They all looked great to me, but the person they found was incredible. In fact, he’s really more of a Fortune 400 C.F.O. who’d be making $400,000 a year but, fortunately for me, had already done the big-company thing.”

Clearly, though, capital remains a priority. The majority of job creation is predicted to come from small companies in the years ahead. The Obama administration has acknowledged the prospect by holding a White House meeting on the issue recently and unveiling several programs aimed at encouraging banks to lend. As the Mitchell Properties example illustrates, however, that the programs exist does not mean private-sector companies will figure out how to exploit them without intermediaries like Next Street.

Like the merchant banks of old, Next Street is also putting its own capital to work. Several early loans totaling roughly $5 million were made directly off the bank’s balance sheet, and it is raising a $100 million small-business investment fund.

Next Street is the first to concede, though, that its model can be done on a large scale only if other investors participate. It is interesting to note that even the recent commitment by Goldman Sachs of $500 million for small-business education, loans and grants is primarily coming from the investment bank’s foundation. It is an act of charity (and a grand public relations gesture), not investment banking.

“We feel strongly that the small-business market deserves access to the same level of advice and capital as larger companies,” Mr. Ferguson said. “But, until now, the attitude has been, why focus on it? The deals are too small. We can’t make enough money.”

It is a provocative proposal for addressing the nation’s employment and small-business credit crisis: Bring back the merchant bank — and, of course, explain what it is.
880 2009-12-24 Already concerned about the watershed, the city’s environmental department hired scientists and environmental engineers who specialize in gas drilling last January to research the potential impact of the drilling. The report concludes that drilling is dangerous for several reasons.

Extracting gas from the shale involves blasting water mixed with chemicals into the rock at a high pressure, which causes the natural gas to flow out. But the process results in significant amounts of wastewater, which can contaminate water supplies and damage the infrastructure, the report found.

Twenty percent to 50 percent of the chemicals used in extraction ends up in the wastewater, for which the state has no disposal method, said Paul Rush, the department’s deputy commissioner, who presented the report at the briefing.

He added that the projected operating costs would increase water rates for New York City residents by at least 30 percent because an increase in filtering costs.

Mr. Rush said the environmental engineers and scientists hired by the department collected data from hydraulic fracturing in other states to draw their conclusions.

“We took a technical look at this and made a decision based on the science,” he said.

Citing data from drilling in Fayetteville, Ark., the scientists estimated that drilling in the New York watershed could result in hundreds of tons of chemicals per day seeping through the watershed over a 20-year period.

Substantial industrial development would be needed to dig and maintain the 3,000 to 6,000 wells in the watershed, the report said. Maintenance alone could result in up to 600,000 trips by truck per year within the watershed’s boundaries, it said.

Responding to rising public concern, the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, which owns the lease to drill in the watershed, announced in October that it did not plan to drill in the watershed under its lease.

Nonetheless, hundreds of New York City residents turned out in November to protest hydraulic drilling at a state hearing on the draft regulations. Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council and an advocate for protection of the watershed, said Wednesday that Chesapeake’s promise meant little.

“It’s nonbinding, it’s temporary and it only applies to one company,” he said at the water board’s meeting. “Other companies could take over the lease, or Chesapeake could choose to go in and drill if they renew the lease.”

Mehul Patel, a member of the water board, also spoke out against the drilling at the meeting. “We’re trading off the most precious natural resource we have,” he said. “It’s appalling to me that the state would consider this.”
881 2009-12-24 On his right wrist, a metal bracelet bears the name of the Rev. Mychal F. Judge, an old friend and the former department chaplain. On Sept. 11, 2001, Chief Cassano and the minister stood shoulder to shoulder.

“That morning, we were speaking,” Chief Cassano said. “And we were in for the worst day of our lives, and I will never forget that.”

“The north tower came down,” he said. “I was lucky enough to scurry up the street a little bit and dove under a rig and was lucky enough to make it out alive.”

The chaplain, who taught him “humility, charity, love,” died in a sea of rubble.

There are innumerable reasons, both rooted in principle and personal experience, why Chief Cassano said that his “No. 1 priority” is the safety of the department’s personnel, so that firefighters can return to their families each day, “safe and sound.”

“This job is really another family,” he said. “I see the kids in the field as if they could be my own son or my own daughter and I would take care of them like I would take care of my own loved ones.”

Born on Jan. 22, 1945, as the second son in an Italian-American family, he was named after the father of his mother, Madeline. The Cassanos lived in South Brooklyn, in a walk-up on First Place in Carroll Gardens.

“Radiator bursting away,” he said. “There were six of us in a six-room apartment. We shared a bed. I didn’t have my own bed until I got married.”

His father’s family came from Ischia, Italy, in 1909; his mother’s family came from Naples. His grandfather worked as a day laborer; his father, Angelo, was a longshoreman on the docks in Red Hook, where he rose to become a boss of loading and unloading the trucks.

“He was very well-respected,” he said. “He was a tough boss, but he was fair, so I had a good role model to follow.”

As a boy, young Sal went to Public School 142 and Brooklyn Tech and then Boys High School, where he bowled. His parents took their four children to Roman Catholic Mass each Sunday, at St. Mary Star of the Sea.

“My mom and dad taught us all about family life and how important your family is,” he said.

At 10, he landed his first job, working for his brother-in-law delivering crates of soda in glass bottles, sometimes walking them up six flights on his shoulder.

He rooted for the Dodgers. His godfather was single and had season tickets to Ebbets Field.

“I used to go there three or four times a week when they were home,” he said. The shortstop Pee Wee Reese was his favorite, so he wore his number, 1, on his jersey in baseball and softball leagues he played in.

After school, he worked with his dad on the waterfront, then found work in a bank. In 1965, at 20, he was drafted into the Army. He served two years, the last one in Vietnam, where he was stationed 40 miles north of Saigon in a base camp with the 11th Armored Cavalry. He started as an artillery specialist, but ended up doing a little of everything.

“When you’re in Vietnam, there was no specialties there,” he said. “You ended up doing border patrol and base camp patrol.” He recalled when the camp was hit with mortar rounds, when it took enemy fire and sniper fire, but he declined to say more. “I don’t want to go into all that stuff,” he said.

After the war, he found work on the waterfront again. His next career change would be his last, and it was again influenced by a family member: his older brother, Patsy, who was already a firefighter. Patsy took him to a firehouse and to a communion breakfast, and urged him to join the department because it was a secure job that would surround him with good people.

“He says, ‘You’re able to help people,’ ” Chief Cassano said. “There’s not many people that have jobs that when they go to work are able to help people and serve the public. And really, that’s what we’re all about, whether you’re the fire commissioner or a probie.”

The younger Cassano joined in November 1969. His brother, though, broke his leg in several places fighting a fire in Brooklyn and retired in 1977.

In April 1978, Salvatore Cassano married Theresa Wallace, a hairdresser whom his sister Lucy had set him up with.

“Blind date,” he said. “We went on a date and that was it. We were married probably a year and a half later.”

He began his well-chronicled way up the ranks. He and his wife had four children. He learned how to move down a smoky hallway; the feeling of helping rescue a child from a fire.

Today, Chief Cassano takes care of his health. He eats very little meat. He eats fruit for lunch. “There is no vegetables I don’t like,” he said. “I like a lot of pasta.”

On Christmas Eve, the family dinner will be at his house. He and his wife will prepare an Italian specialty involving seven types of seafood, including shrimp, clams, crabmeat, calamari and flounder.

Most mornings, when the weather is good, he leaves his family, his 10-year-old beagle, Jessie, and sets out for roadwork around his home in the Huguenot area of Staten Island. Four times, he has run the New York City marathon, breaking the three-hour mark.

“I just go out my door and run,” he says of his daily four-mile jaunts. “You don’t need anybody to do it, you don’t need a membership. You need a pair of sneakers and running clothes.”

“It’s a great stress relief,” he said, one that allows him to think about the past and the future. Mostly, he concentrates on breathing.

He knows, from his days wearing the firefighter’s turnout gear, what it feels like to run out of air.
882 2009-12-24 The figures released Wednesday — the last state estimates to be published before actual results from the 2010 census count become available — reflect data as of July. The numbers are both the most up-to-date reflection of the recession’s impact nationwide, and the best available predictor of Congressional reapportionment.

In all, 17 states would be subjected to redistricting if the estimates hold in the door-to-door head count next year. Influence would generally shift from traditionally Democratic northern areas struggling with industrial decline and an aging population, to the South and the West, where independents are ascendant and disputes over immigration, taxes, and environmental issues, like water supply, tend to stand out.

Texas, for example, appears to be the big winner. It would gain three seats in Congress under the July estimate, bringing its total to 35. Between July 2008 and July 2009, it added more people from home and abroad than any other state — 231,539. That is more than Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida and Nevada, combined.

More broadly, however, the recession that began in 2007 has significantly slowed the great American migration toward warmth and sun. It was a move, earlier in the decade, driven as much by quality of life as easy credit, according to demographers and economists. But the reversal is nearly as striking.

State rankings prepared by Mr. Frey, based on the new numbers, show that Florida is now 45th in domestic migration growth after ranking first from July 2001 to July 2005. It lost 31,179 people to other states from July 2008 to July 2009.

In terms of its total growth rate with foreign arrivals included, Florida now ranks 32nd, down from third in 2002.

Similarly, Nevada has fallen to 17th on the total growth-rate list, after leading the country from 2000 to 2004. It now ranks 36th in domestic migration, losing 3,801 people after adding more than 170,000 from other areas of the country from July 2003 to July 2006. Arizona, meanwhile, dropped to eighth in overall growth rate. Only three years ago, it was in first place.

“The population trends are obviously now being shaped by this economic decline,” said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College demographer. “The places that have had a really big decline economically, the states hit most heavily by the real estate crisis, have certainly had a real decline of people showing up there.”

Earlier census reports suggested that the recession has been defined in part by a lack of mobility, as millions of Americans stay in homes they cannot sell. The new data also show that for the third year in a row, international immigration declined.

Politically, to some extent, that means that the demographic changes from the boom earlier in the decade are being locked in by the bust.

Formerly high-growth states are likely to gain seats in Congress. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah and Washington would add one seat each, according to an analysis of the figures by Dr. Beveridge at Queens College.

Politicians in Texas, whose economy has been buffered by high oil prices, a growing technology sector and less of a crash in real estate, are already haggling over what promises to be a contentious redistricting fight. In all, 18 Congressional districts in the state have added more than 100,000 people since 2000.

Much of the growth has been in conservative suburban districts around Dallas and Houston, but political scientists believe that many of the newcomers will lean liberal. “It means a Republican state becomes bigger and a little less Republican,” said Sean Theriault, a professor of government at the University of Texas.

Meanwhile, most of the states that would lose representation in Congress are those that spent the first two-thirds of the decade funneling people south. Ohio would lose two seats, leaving it with 16, Dr. Beveridge found. States losing one seat include Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.

Or at least that is how it looks right now. Cincinnati officials fought what they described as a census undercount tied to a population estimate in 2007, and state officials in Ohio said Wednesday that they were doing everything possible to ensure that everyone was counted so that only one seat would be lost.

“The bottom line is no one should count Ohio out,” said Amanda Wurst, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat. “We’re going to make sure that the population is accurately reflected in the census, and fight for that Congressional seat.”
883 2009-12-24 Stocks ended an erratic session with a slender gain Wednesday as rising commodity prices offset disappointment over an unexpected drop in home sales.

Gains in commodities drove the shares of energy and materials-producing companies higher, lending support to the overall stock market. Gold, oil and other commodities rose as the dollar dropped.

The dollar ended a four-day winning streak as economic data reinforced investors’ belief that the recovery would be slow.

The Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell 11.3 percent in November to their lowest level since March. The slump was disappointing because economists had forecast an increase, and because the news came a day after stocks rose on a separate report showing a better-than-expected gain in sales of existing homes last month.

The housing disappointment followed news that personal spending and income both rose in November. However, economists say growth remains too weak to sustain a strong recovery.
884 2009-12-24 During the past year, the government has tightened restrictions on access to the Internet, suppressed the country’s small band of public advocacy lawyers and jailed activists who blamed poor school construction for the deaths of thousands of children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

Legal scholars say they worry that top party leaders seem less amenable to building an impartial legal system and allowing people to exercise the political rights in China’s Constitution, which could mean that intellectuals and civic groups have less room to operate.

Although Mr. Liu is charged with writing six articles recently published on overseas Web sites, the main accusation seems to be a role in creating Charter 08, a political reformer’s wish list that attracted 10,000 signatures this year during its brief life on China’s heavily censored Internet.

The petition called for rule of law, expanded human rights and an end to the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. Most poignantly, it sought to guarantee the right to unfettered speech and the abolition of the very law under which Mr. Liu is now being tried. “We should end the practice of viewing words as crimes,” the document said.

A literature professor and prolific writer, Mr. Liu, 53, was a visiting scholar at Columbia University when student protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989. He quickly returned home, joined hunger strikers and, as the military closed in, encouraged students to leave the square peacefully.

After soldiers regained control of the capital, Mr. Liu was detained and held for 21 months without trial. In 1996, after publicly demanding the release of those still imprisoned for their roles in the protests, he was sent to a labor camp for three years.

But although he was fired from his teaching job, Mr. Liu became a symbol of the small but real space for expressing opinions in a changing China. He continued to write provocative essays with titles like “The Chinese Communist Party’s Dictatorial Patriotism” and meet with like-minded intellectuals who urge China to embrace democracy without violent upheaval.

“We couldn’t have a repeat of June 4, where all sides lose, so we came up with a constructive way forward,” said Zhang Zuhua, a lead author of Charter 08, referring to the date of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.

In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Zhang described how he and about 100 other people laid out their aspirations and batted the document back and forth for a few months. Posted online last December, the manifesto, whose name is a reference to Charter 77, a Soviet-era petition by Czech dissidents, quickly gained thousands of signatures from workers, teachers and retired party members.

Party leaders and security officials saw the charter as a step too far.

The police questioned most of the original signers, about 300 people, and detained two of them: Mr. Liu, who has been held in a secret location, and Mr. Zhang, who was later released but is now subjected to round-the-clock surveillance.

In his defense, Mr. Liu’s lawyers argued that he had written more than 490 articles since 2005 but that the authorities chose only six as evidence that he sought to subvert the state, according to his younger brother, Liu Xiaoxuan, who attended the trial. “He rejected their argument that Charter 08 brought about a ‘malevolent social impact’ and told the court that his remarks are within the realm of free speech, which is protected by the Constitution,” the brother said.

Mr. Liu’s lawyers have expressed frustration with the judicial process, saying for months that they had no access to their client and that they received the indictment less than two weeks ago, leaving little time to prepare a defense.

Officials in the West have also taken up Mr. Liu’s case, although it is unclear whether the diplomatic pressure would have any impact. On Wednesday, a contingent of two dozen consular officials from European nations, Canada and the United States lingered outside the courthouse, having been barred from entry at the last minute despite applying for permits a week earlier.

“We were simply told there were no more seats,” said Nicholas Weeks, the first secretary of the Swedish Embassy.

The defendant’s wife, Liu Xia, was also kept from the trial by security officials who watch her apartment building day and night. “I’m already prepared for the worst,” she said by telephone.

Despite the heavy security, about two dozen supporters of Mr. Liu gathered at the courthouse on Wednesday morning stamping their feet against the cold.

Lei Ji, 48, an unemployed meat plant worker and self-described social critic, made an 18-hour train ride to show his solidarity outside the courthouse. He said that he had never met Mr. Liu but that they had exchanged e-mail messages in years past. And yes, he said proudly, he had signed Charter 08.

Then he reached into his fraying leather satchel to reveal a bundle of photocopied manifestoes. “I’m not afraid,” he said after handing one to a court official who had stepped outside to look at the scene. “I love China. I just want my country to have freedom and human rights.”

887 2009-12-25 James Gurley, who played guitar in Big Brother and the Holding Company, the psychedelic rock band that brought Janis Joplin to fame, died on Sunday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 69.

The cause was a heart attack, said the band’s manager, Tim Murphy.

One of the central groups of San Francisco’s fertile mid-1960s rock scene, Big Brother and the Holding Company took blues-based songs on long, strange, electric trips that often featured Mr. Gurley’s protracted solos. In an interview in 2007 with The Desert Sun, in Palm Springs, Calif., Mr. Gurley said that his approach was inspired by the music of John Coltrane.

“I heard a lone saxophone raging like a madman,” he said. “And that’s what developed my style: Play it like crazy.”

The son of a Detroit stunt-car driver, Mr. Gurley moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s and became a staple of the music scene there. He joined his fellow guitarists Sam Andrew and Peter Albin to form Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1965. At the suggestion of the band’s manager, Chet Helms, Joplin joined as lead singer in June 1966 and the group quickly shot to fame.

After performing at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, Big Brother was aggressively pursued by Clive Davis of Columbia Records. Following months of negotiations to extract the band from an earlier record contract, Columbia signed the group for about $250,000, according to Fredric Dannen’s book “Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business” (Random House, 1990).

“Cheap Thrills,” the band’s first album for Columbia, went to No. 1 and became one of the biggest hits of 1968. The group’s single “Piece of My Heart” reached No. 12 on the Billboard pop chart.

889 2009-12-25 The price per metric ton of permits to spew carbon-dioxide into the atmosphere fell by $3.30 on the European Climate Exchange between the first day of the climate summit in Copenhagen and the day after its disappointing conclusion as traders reacted to the failure to reach binding targets for future carbon emissions.

The decline — which put the price of the benchmark futures contract dated December 2010 at $18.20 per ton — reflects the European market’s deflated expectations that the meetings would lead to a treaty to lower emissions ceilings and boost the price of permits.

The depressed price of the emissions permits also suggests that despite years of diplomatic efforts, the real world — where people and businesses buy energy to make things, move things and stay warm — still operates as if people can spew carbon more or less at will.

Consider how much carbon really costs.

After reviewing a series of independent studies, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded last year that the “social cost” of releasing one more ton of carbon-dioxide into the air, the cost of the environmental damage and other consequences over the next century, was between $40 and $68 in 2007 and would rise to up to $179 in 2040 if we don’t cut emissions soon.

A review of the economics of climate change by Nicholas Stern, a professor at London School of Economics, which was written at the behest of the British government in 2006, asserted that emissions should be priced initially at about $75 a ton to encourage investments in alternative energy sources and reduce the use of fossil fuels enough to avoid drastic climate change.

His prescription may be politically unrealistic, at least for now. But if carbon were that expensive, behavior would change. Carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States amount to about 18 metric tons per person per year. The kind of money Mr. Stern is talking about would add up to an annual bill of $1,350 per American. Translated into a gas tax, Mr. Stern’s price tag is about 66 cents per gallon — a convincing argument to swap the sport-utility vehicle for a Prius.
890 2009-12-25 “Persecution of individuals for the peaceful expression of political views is inconsistent with internationally recognized norms of human rights,” he said.

Although Mr. Liu had faced a 15-year sentence, legal experts and human rights advocates said the punishment was very harsh and was meant to send a message to others who might agitate for political reform in one of the world’s longest-running authoritarian governments.

Nicholas Bequelin, a senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, described Mr. Liu as “a sacrificial lamb” and said that the Communist Party leadership was trying to intimidate its critics. The rights group called the trial “a travesty of justice.”

Mr. Bequelin and others said Mr. Liu’s prosecution for violating rights enshrined in China’s Constitution suggested a political hardening, a trend that began before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

“It shows that the leadership is increasingly conservative and restrictive of basic freedoms,” Mr. Bequelin said, “and it also sends a strong message to the rest of the world that China is not really serious when it talks about human rights.”

Joshua Rosenzweig, a senior researcher at the Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates on behalf of Chinese political prisoners, said Mr. Liu’s sentence was the longest for subversion charges in more than a decade.

In 2005, Shi Tao, a journalist and poet, was convicted of leaking state secrets and given a 10-year term after he sent an internal party memo to an overseas Web site. Last year, Hu Jia, an AIDS activist and environmentalist, was imprisoned for three and a half years on charges that his Internet writings incited subversion.

Mr. Liu has been held in secret for more than a year and his lawyers were given less than two weeks to prepare their defense. The trial on Wednesday lasted two hours and was closed; his wife, Liu Xia, and more than two dozen diplomats from the United States, Canada and the European Union were barred from the courtroom.

On Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman angrily dismissed foreign criticisms of Mr. Liu’s prosecution, calling them a “gross interference of China’s internal affairs.”

This is not Mr. Liu’s first brush with China’s harsh judicial system. He spent 21 months in detention for taking part in the 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. And in 1996, after demanding clemency for those still imprisoned for their roles in the demonstrations, he was sent to a labor camp for three years.

In addition to helping create Charter 08, Mr. Liu’s charge for “inciting subversion of state power” was based on six articles he wrote that were published on the Internet outside of China.

Released on Dec. 10, 2008, International Human Rights Day, Charter 08 garnered some 10,000 signatures before it was removed from the Web by government censors. To this day, it is virtually unknown in China.

During the brief trial on Wednesday, Mr. Liu’s lawyers rejected the prosecution’s contention that the document sought to overthrow the Communist Party. Zhang Zuhua, a former party official and political scholar who co-authored the manifesto with Mr. Liu, described the subversion charge as “absurd,” calling it “a violation of the Chinese Constitution’s guarantee of free speech.” Mr. Zhang was briefly detained last year and has since been under 24-hour surveillance by security personnel.

The state-controlled media has not covered Mr. Liu’s trial — nor has it allowed any mention of Charter 08 — but Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, published a brief item Friday that described the sentence and said the court “had strictly followed the legal procedures in this case and fully protected Liu’s litigation rights.”

News of his sentencing quickly spread via Twitter, which is blocked in China but can be accessed by those able to circumvent the so-called Great Firewall. Many of those who sent messages displayed the image of a yellow ribbon as a declaration of their sympathies. Others defiantly listed personal details about the presiding judge in the case.

At least two dozen supporters who stood outside the courthouse during Mr. Liu’s trial on Wednesday were later questioned and released.

Liu Di, a signer of Charter 08, was among a handful of people who publicly declared their desire to stand trial with Liu Xiaobo.

“For the dignity of the Constitution and the law, and for no more imprisonment of people for their independent opinions, I would prefer to share with Mr. Liu Xiaobo the same case with the same penalty,” wrote Ms. Liu, a blogger better known by her online identity, the Stainless Steel Mouse.

On Friday, officials allowed the defendant and his wife to meet for 10 minutes in a small room, although they were divided by a glass barrier. It was the third time they had seen each other since his detention last year.

“People always say they’re so inhumane,” she said of the government afterward, “so I think they just wanted to show a little humanity.”
891 2009-12-25 The Case Foundation, known for helping nonprofit groups mobilize money and support through online social networks, took a decidedly old-school approach to helping a large charity this holiday season.

Last week, Jean Case, who started the foundation with her husband, Stephen M. Case, the founder of America Online, joined foundation staff members at two Salvation Army kettles outside a Macy’s store in Washington.

“Digital forms of giving are gaining,” Ms. Case, the foundation’s chief executive, said. “But we clearly recognize the importance of neighbor-to-neighbor giving, too. And what’s more a symbol of that than the Salvation Army bell ringers?”

The biggest challenge, she said, was learning to control the bell. “I didn’t understand that there are different bell-holding techniques, and I got a little enthusiastic singing carols and the bell kept flying out of my hand,” she said.

Michael Smith, the foundation’s vice president for social innovation, said he was surprised on the one hand, by how many passers-by avoided eye contact, and on the other, by how warm so many donors were.

“We were caroling in our group, singing loudly and most assuredly off key,” Mr. Smith said. “One guy even started singing along with us as he dropped a dollar into the bucket.”
892 2009-12-25 “Of all the guys I’ve ever seen in this league, in 20-plus years, in terms of basketball ability he’s in the top 1 or 2 percent,” said Dallas Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle, who was Bird’s top assistant in Indiana.

If not for chronic knee problems, Bender might be padding a Hall of Fame résumé by now. Instead, he is methodically resurrecting his career, one jump shot at a time, with the rebuilding Knicks.

After four years away from the N.B.A., Bender returned 12 days ago to begin an improbable comeback at age 28. He is bigger and stronger now, and more vulnerable to gravity. But his jumper has lost none of its silkiness.

Bender scored 20 points over his first two games, in just 29 minutes. He made his first four 3-point attempts and drove confidently to the basket. His third game was cut short because of a cranky hip, leaving him questionable for the Knicks’ game against Miami on Friday. The injury is not considered serious. But Bender’s caution is understandable.

When he retired in February 2006, Bender could hardly walk a flight of stairs without intense pain. He had lost most of his cartilage in both knees and had played in just 30 games over his final two and a half seasons. But he never fully surrendered.

“I had in my mind, ‘It ain’t over,’ ” Bender said of his thinking on the day he left the N.B.A. “ ‘I’m going to try it again some day.’ ”

His journey back is filled with the same sense of wonder and inspiration that once accompanied his dunks.

Over the last four years, Bender has recast himself as a businessman and philanthropist — “a social entrepreneur,” in his words — primarily in New Orleans, not far from his hometown, Picayune.

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Bender worked with developers and nonprofit groups to restore more than 30 damaged homes. He adopted a flood-ravaged school in Kenner, La., in an impoverished neighborhood near the airport. He had the school library renovated and restocked with new books and computers. He paid for holiday parties and distributed hundreds of presents at Christmas.

“He’s always been a big-hearted person,” said Bender’s sister, Valerie McDowell, who also works for him.

The goal is not just charity, Bender said, but empowerment. He is working with local nonprofit groups and a program at Dillard University to help low-income families eventually purchase the homes he has renovated.

“They learn about budgets, they learn about their credit score and all that stuff,” Bender said. “And then months down the line, maybe years down the line, after they pass those classes and get themselves in order, now we partner up with a bank so they can purchase the house.”

“We have to take responsibility to empower them mentally and financially and educate them on how to actually own a house,” he said.

Bender, who never attended college, acquired his business skills solely through hands-on work and an inquisitive mind. He read books and sought out mentor figures. He met with bank presidents and asked a lot of questions.

“I felt dumb, but I learned a lot,” he said. “And I started understanding exactly what they were saying.”

None of this comes as a surprise to the teammates and coaches who worked with Bender during his six and a half seasons in Indiana. Donnie Walsh, who was then running the Pacers, had assembled a group of former high school stars: Bender, Al Harrington and Jermaine O’Neal, each of them bursting with talent and expectations. The three became fast friends. But Bender was different.

“Quiet dude,” said Harrington, now a teammate on the Knicks. “Very serious about his business.”

Carlisle described Bender as pensive and reserved, despite his flashiness on the floor.

“He was not extravagant with spending and those kinds of things,” Carlisle said. “For a kid that was a direct-from-high-school player, he had a wisdom and I guess sort of an awareness of life that was beyond his years.”

Walsh traded Antonio Davis, a valued veteran center, to acquire Bender from the Toronto Raptors, who made him the fifth pick in the 1999 draft. It was the highest any high school star had been drafted to that point, and Bender had the background to justify it.

He averaged 23.1 points, 15 rebounds, 5 blocks and 4 assists in high school and scored 31 points in 31 minutes in the McDonald’s All-American Game, breaking a record held by Michael Jordan.

In his early practices with the Pacers, Bender routinely made plays — a rebound, a block, a dunk — that left teammates awestruck.

“The other guys would stop and go, ‘Did you see what he just did?’ ” said Walsh, who is now the Knicks’ president. “The whole team would stop.”

In his N.B.A. debut, Bender scored 10 points in 13 minutes, helping the Pacers beat the Cleveland Cavaliers. But like most teenage stars, he needed time to grow and adapt to the N.B.A. game and played sparingly as a rookie.

There were flashes of greatness in his second year, including a 20-point, 5-rebound, 4-block game against Orlando, in just 24 minutes. He scored 19 points in 19 minutes in a 2004 playoff victory over Boston, and helped lock down Paul Pierce.

But injuries defined most of Bender’s career. He missed 36 games in 2002-3 because of a torn calf muscle. His knee problems, which began in high school, became more debilitating over time. Bender played just 21 games in 2003-4 and 7 the next season. He played only two games in 2005-6 before retiring.

“It was heartbreaking for everyone,” Carlisle said.

Bender began plotting his return about a year and a half ago. He invented his own resistance training device, Bender Bands (which are now under development at Purdue University), to help strengthen and balance his legs. He also began working with Charles Austin, the former Olympic high jumper, who overcame his own knee problems to win the gold medal in 1996. Bender said he had compensated for the lack of cartilage with an abundance of muscle.

Bender made more than $30 million with the Pacers and has managed his money well. He does not need the N.B.A. for fame or riches or self-fulfillment. Yet here he is, spending hours in the weight room and on the court, working on that picture-perfect jumper, trying to wring another game, another month, another season out of a once-promising career.

There are no lofty goals and no expectations of stardom now, just a Gulf Coast kid empowering himself to dream again. Bender said he wanted to set an example for the underprivileged children he worked with back home, that “you can fight and come back from bad situations.”

“If I fail, I’ll face it,” he said. “But I can’t live with not trying.”
893 2009-12-25 There is still a glut of free-agent outfielders available — Marlon Byrd, Johnny Damon, Jermaine Dye — who stand to command less expensive contracts than Bay, which would work against him if he is not keen on signing with the Mets. As it happens, the Mets have expressed interest in Byrd, but the Cubs are in hotter pursuit and are considered a favorite to sign him. The Cardinals are the only team besides the Mets definitely looking for a slugging left fielder, but they want Matt Holliday and do not see Bay as a fallback option.

As the Mets wait on Bay — and catcher Bengie Molina — their National League East rivals have improved. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired perhaps the best pitcher in baseball, Roy Halladay. The Atlanta Braves, after already signing Billy Wagner and Takashi Saito, have added Melky Cabrera and Troy Glaus. Even the Nationals have made headway by luring Jason Marquis and Matt Capps to Washington. All have made significant additions this off-season; the Mets haven’t.

In each of the last five years, Minaya has made at least one major move — and often a flurry of them — by this point. After almost reaching the World Series in 2006, the Mets acted swiftly to bring back Orlando Hernandez and Valentin, sign Moises Alou and Damion Easley and complete four-player deals with Florida and San Diego.

The following off-season, their big addition did not arrive until February — Johan Santana — but in November they re-signed Ramon Castro and Luis Castillo and traded for Brian Schneider and Ryan Church. Last year, the Mets waited for the closer market to develop and then pounced at the winter meetings, remodeling their bullpen by signing Francisco Rodriguez and trading for J. J. Putz in a three-team blockbuster.

Minaya’s first big signing as the Mets’ general manager was Pedro Martinez, whose arrival in December 2004 infused the franchise with credibility and helped to make it a preferred destination. The Mets, it seems, have undone some of that progress. They may have to overpay to interest Bay in relocating to Flushing, and even then he may not want to come.

As of now, the Mets do not seem to have reached the point of offering Bay (or Molina) an ultimatum, which means they are still hoping that their patient strategy will prevail. And they may be right — particularly if there is no market for Bay beyond their own offer.

Of course, if the Mets are unable to sign Bay, questions will be raised about their approach of spending weeks concentrating on one big-name free agent rather than spreading around their money from the start to fill various needs. After all, for a bit more than the Mets have offered Bay annually, they might have been able to sign both Chone Figgins to bat near the top of the lineup and Randy Wolf to become a reliable starting pitcher. Their deals were struck two weeks ago.

The Mets were on the verge Thursday night of signing the right-hander Kelvim Escobar to a major league contract, according to a team official with direct knowledge of the negotiations. An 18-game winner with the Angels in 2007, Escobar, 33, was limited to one start over the past two seasons because of shoulder problems. He has been pitching winter ball in his native Venezuela in an effort to demonstrate his health.
894 2009-12-25 The curators, Donald Albrecht and Thomas Mellins, have instead chosen to install large fabric screens with photographic reproductions — basically, a walk-in magazine.

Most of the screens hew closely to the layouts in the book, which in turn echo the combinations of large and small photographs that were characteristic of Look. The material, in any form, is fascinating (though it’s disappointing that only three copies of the actual magazine are on view).

On the book’s cover, for instance, is an arresting image taken at a performance staged for the magazine by Salvador Dalí. In it he uses a bent-over-backwards bikini-clad model as a desk, balancing a notebook and a telephone on sensitive parts of her anatomy.

Many other images in the show and book never made it into the pages of Look, which ran more like a photo agency than a magazine. Its photographers were given freedoms unfathomable to today’s penny-pinching publishing executives. As the book notes, this strategy was designed to help the bi-weekly Look compete with the weekly Life by allowing the department to cherry-pick from a wide array of stories.

Among the talents Look attracted was a young Stanley Kubrick, who sold his first photograph to the magazine at the age of 16 and continued to work for it for five years. In his images of prizefighters and showgirls, New York is a noirish, not-quite-believable backdrop, as it was in Kubrick’s much later film “Eyes Wide Shut.”

Even his sunnier assignments have a suspenseful edge. He was one of three photographers assigned to cover the spectacle of a Midtown billboard painter working, high up on a scaffold, from a live model. The other shooters focused on the woman and the product, the Peter Pan bra company’s “Merry-Go-Round” (slogan: “The secret’s in the circle!”). Kubrick took close-ups of the gobsmacked people on the ground.

In between stunts like this one the magazine relied on famous faces. Portraits of models and entertainers, typified by a primping Lisa Fonssagrives and a leaping Ray Bolger, were Look’s bread and butter.

On occasion movers and shakers in other industries received the celebrity treatment. In one photograph from 1957 the Museum of Modern Art director René D’Harnoncourt poses in a room full of objects from the design collection. Published in a special New York issue, it was accompanied by an article titled “The Taste-Shaper.”

That issue, from Feb. 18, 1958, is on view at the museum — open to a color spread on Park Avenue construction, captured by the longtime Look contributor Arthur Rothstein. It’s as if the buildings are going up faster than he can photograph them, an effect Rothstein exaggerated in other pictures taken with a fish-eye lens.

The magazine made tentative forays beyond Manhattan, in two markedly different stories on Brooklyn. The first one, “The Brooklyn Nobody Knows,” challenged the borough’s sleepy residential image with shots of cultural figures and institutions. The second, “Could This Happen to Your Boy?,” focused on the neighbors of four murder suspects from Brooklyn and adopted a more sensationalist tone.

Such negative stories were rare. Look promoted the city as a place of luck, vigor and spontaneous affection, à la Cartier-Bresson’s Paris. One starry-eyed series from 1947, “Love Is Everywhere,” showed couples kissing in stairwells and on fire escapes and park benches.

By the 1970s the city’s charm had faded. So had Look. The circumstances of its death sound eerily familiar: a new medium (television) siphoning advertising dollars, the rising costs of paper and printing, a hobbled economy.

A trip through the Look archives won’t answer the trickier, economic questions now stumping publishers. In other ways, though, “Only in New York” is heartening. It reminds you that drastic changes in visual culture can spawn successful magazines — and hints that strong images, in some form or another, will always have a place.
895 2009-12-25 MOSCOW — Russia and Georgia have agreed to reopen their major border crossing, officials said Thursday, signaling the first thawing of ties between the countries since they went to war last year over a separatist enclave.

The crossing, at the Upper Lars checkpoint in the Caucasus mountains, has been closed since 2006, when relations began growing tense, in part because of efforts by the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, to align himself more closely with the United States.

Russia also banned imports of Georgian products, including popular wines, and cut air transportation links. In August 2008, war broke out after Georgia tried to retake South Ossetia, a separatist enclave that has close ties to Moscow, and Russian troops responded by invading Georgia.

The countries have not had diplomatic relations since then. The Kremlin insists that it will have no direct contact with Mr. Saakashvili, but it has lately expressed more willingness to lessen the pressure on Georgia.

Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said this month that he was not opposed to restoring air links, though he did not formally propose doing so. A Georgian airline said this week that it would apply to the Russian authorities for permission to fly to Moscow from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
896 2009-12-25 Norton, which spent two years negotiating a deal to publish the book and another two years putting it together, originally printed just 5,000 copies, guided by pessimistic booksellers who didn’t think they could sell many during an economic downturn.

“I had done all my planning on a bigger print run to begin with, but then the economy tanked,” said Jim Mairs, Norton’s editor at large. “When our sales reps went out with an expensive book, the response from stores was not anywhere close to what I had hoped it would be.”

The book is considered the Holy Grail by many Jungians, who for years had only heard rumors of its existence. For decades Jung’s descendants kept the original, leather-bound volume, which Jung worked on between 1912 and 1928, locked in a bank vault.

It took Sonu Shamdasani, the primary translator and the writer of a 33-page introductory essay, two years to persuade Jung’s family to let him start working on a color copy of the original book.

Mr. Mairs first saw about 30 facsimile pages of “The Red Book” and some of Mr. Shamdasani’s introductory material.

“I was blown away,” Mr. Mairs recalled. “I really am not a Jungian. I looked at it simply as an object that was so beautiful I couldn’t keep my hands off it.”

Once Norton secured the contract to publish the book, it paid about $85,000 for a high-tech scan of the original journals in Zurich. Mr. Mairs arranged for an Italian printer to print and partly hand-bind the volumes. By the time it was ready for publication this year, Mr. Mairs ratcheted back his original plans for a print run of 15,000 copies to just 5,000.

Booksellers were wary of ordering too many copies. “I was pretty cautious because last holiday season, if it was over $39.95, nobody bought it,” said Cathy Langer, the lead buyer for the Tattered Cover stores in Denver. “So I went conservatively.”

But as customers saw news coverage or heard about an exhibition of the original “Red Book” at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, they started to request the book, released in October, and many booksellers quickly sold out.

As orders mounted, the publisher commissioned a reprinting, and then went back to press three more times, taking the total to 25,000, with 10,000 more on the way. But Mr. Mairs said that because the book is partly hand-bound, uses two different kinds of custom-made paper and is printed in Italy, it can take up to six weeks to get the books printed and shipped to the United States.

While committed Jungians have been waiting decades for the book, there are only about 1,000 analysts who follow Jung’s principles in North America, according to Stephen Martin, co-founder and president emeritus of the Philemon Foundation, a Jungian nonprofit group that raised money to help prepare “The Red Book” for publication, helping to finance Mr. Shamdasani’s translation, among other things. Booksellers say that buyers have extended outside Jungian interest groups.

“The thing I find interesting is that I’m not even sure that a lot of people buying them” have shown any previous interest in Jung, said Sarah McNally, owner of McNally Jackson Books in Manhattan. “There are a lot of $15 Jung books that they haven’t ever bought.”

Ms. Jackson said that the first five copies of “The Red Book” that she ordered were spoken for before they even arrived. She has since reordered, but the publisher could not fulfill the order completely, and the store is now sold out.

“I think that when times are tough, the people are very aware of what is ethereal and also what is peripheral, like all the little new toys that come out,” said Barbara Meade, an owner of Politics and Prose, an independent bookstore in Washington that has sold 25 copies. “Somehow books seem to be something that is a lasting value.”

Dennis Paul, a retired lawyer in Fox Point, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, who has amassed a library of books on psychology, philosophy and theology, requested that his local bookstore, the Boswell Book Company, order him a copy of “The Red Book.” He has spent the last three weeks reading it.

“It’s not about becoming or self-help or jumping all over the place,” Mr. Paul said, “but sitting firm with what we are and recognizing that the other is essentially unknowable.”

He added: “It’s very profound. It kind of centers you and kind of humbles you and brings you down from the normal conversations we have all the time.”

Daniel Goldin, the owner of Boswell, said that after Mr. Paul bought his copy, the store started getting further requests from customers and reordered. Now he is out of stock, he said, and wishing he had had the courage to order more in the first place.

“It’s one of those books,” Mr. Goldin said, “where we now say to ourselves, ‘If we had bought 15 or 20, would we have sold them all?’ ”
897 2009-12-25 How did the economists fail so badly as trustees in the years running up to this financial crisis? Part of the answer is that one of the greatest economists of the 20th century, Hyman Minsky, was forgotten. It was Minsky who identified the way financial stability can breed overconfidence and thus produce the very types of market failures that created the crisis. But he was not a mathematical genius, and thus was out of the mainstream of postwar economics.

It became possible to get a Ph.D. in economics without ever hearing of Minsky. If Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke knew of him, they certainly disregarded his theories, to the detriment of all of us.

In “The Cost of Capitalism: Understanding Market Mayhem and Stabilizing our Economic Future,” Robert J. Barbera, one of the best Wall Street economists, sets out to explain Minsky’s importance and, in the process, to demolish some of the absurdities that came from the mathematical models of neoclassical economics, including the belief that, since markets always produce equilibrium, rising unemployment simply reflects a decision by workers to choose leisure rather than work for less.

“Ask an unemployed guy in a bar if he is enjoying his extended vacation,” Mr. Barbera writes, “and you may well have asked your last question.”

John Cassidy, a writer for The New Yorker, knows his Minsky and he knows financial markets too. The result is a lengthy book, “How Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities,” that brilliantly dissects much of what has passed for economic wisdom, and decries the lack of humility from those whose theories helped cause the disaster.

Early on, he tells the story of a speech delivered in 2005 to the Kansas City Fed conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., by Raghuram G. Rajan, then the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, whose warnings about how the system could blow up now seem prescient. He was greeted with scorn. Larry Summers, then the president of Harvard and now an adviser to President Obama, dismissed the paper’s premise as “largely misguided” and warned it could harm the world by encouraging unwise additional regulation.

Mr. Cassidy also quotes a column by Harvard’s Greg Mankiw, in The Times last May, in which Mr. Mankiw wrote that “despite the enormity of recent events, the principles of economics are largely unchanged.” Students, he said, still needed to learn about “the efficiency properties of market outcomes.”

Mr. Cassidy asks, “What do you suppose that refers to? Builders constructing homes for which there is no demand? Mortgage lenders foisting costly subprime loans on little old ladies of limited education?” Nothing so specific, says Mr. Cassidy. Textbook economics overlooks such inconvenient realities. “In the world of Utopian economics, the latest crisis of capitalism is always a blip.”

Larry Summers comes out a lot better in “The Myth of the Rational Market: A History of Risk, Reward and Delusion on Wall Street,” by Justin Fox of Time magazine. That is because Mr. Fox focuses on the younger Summers, who delighted in pointing to the illogic of much financial economics. “He constructed a model of an alternate financial universe in which investors weren’t rational and prices didn’t reflect fundamental values — and showed that, over a 50-year observation period, there was no way to differentiate it statistically from a rationally random market,” Mr. Fox writes.

Mr. Fox sets out to explain the efficient market hypothesis, a hypothesis that, as Mr. Summers observed, could never be proved but that was accepted as gospel by many economists until behavioral economists like Yale’s Robert Shiller pointed to clear evidence that many of us do not act rationally. This perceptive and penetrating book does a good job of tracing how that hypothesis led to the creation of markets that produced excesses and then ceased to function.

Sometimes history books say as much about the era in which the book is written as about the era being described. So it is in “The Match King: Ivar Kreuger, the Financial Genius Behind a Century of Wall Street Scandals,” by Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego who has written previous books critical of the Wall Street where he once worked.

Kreuger was one of the most celebrated international financiers of the 1920s, a man who grew his family’s Swedish match company in part by lending money to governments in turn for match monopolies. Investors lined up to entrust money to him; presidents and prime ministers sought his counsel. He started a movie company and discovered a Swedish teenager named Greta Gustafson, who changed her name to Garbo.

Then his empire collapsed, and he was denounced as a crook.

The truth, as Mr. Partnoy concludes after going through many previously unexamined records, is more complex. He expresses doubt that Kreuger could have been convicted of fraud if he had not died first, apparently from suicide. There were more assets than at first appeared when accountants concluded Kreuger had simply been a fraud.

It is a tale with more than a few similarities to the present, Mr. Partnoy writes. “Start with massive undisclosed risks on Wall Street; magnify those risks with excess leverage; pyramid that leverage with complex new financial instruments few people understand; pay bankers and accountants small fortunes to look the other way; and then watch helplessly as prices plunge and investors realize their savings are built on sand.”

Commodore Vanderbilt, as he came to be known, has long deserved a great biography, and now has one. “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,” by T. J. Stiles, describes an uneducated man who revolutionized transportation in America.

Entrepreneurs who destroy accepted ways of business with something new tend to be young, or at least not to have much of a stake in the status quo. But Vanderbilt was a very successful steamship operator, and was in his late 60s when he decided to get into the railroad business. It was his consolidation of the great New York Central that provided the wealth that later Vanderbilts would spend so ostentatiously.

He did much more than wheel and deal, more than compete viciously when others would not cooperate. “Vanderbilt’s consolidation of one railroad company into another into an empire would mark a profound change in the nature of the corporation itself,” Mr. Stiles wrote. “He would strip it of its remaining public character as he finished the long process of converting it into a vehicle for private gain alone.”

900 2009-12-26 This past summer, you reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration published a “reassuring” study about the safety of Gardasil, a cervical cancer vaccine that is routinely recommended for girls as young as 11 (“Study on Vaccine for Cervical Cancer Finds Benefits Despite Some Risks,” news article, Aug. 19).

The study was actually quite troubling — the complications included at least 20 deaths that may have been linked to the vaccine, and information provided by the drug’s manufacturer often “failed to provide enough information for further investigation.”

Now you report that most of the C.D.C. experts who reviewed the cervical cancer vaccine in 2007 had potential financial conflicts (“Advisers on Vaccines Often Have Conflicts, Report Says,” news article, Dec. 18).

The extent to which financial interests of the experts affected the validity of the study must be investigated. The health of millions of girls depends on it.
901 2009-12-26 WYTHEVILLE, Va. (AP) — As a post office standoff wore on on Wednesday, the hostages say, the suspect slowly opened up to them.

The suspect, Warren Taylor, told them he had been in the Marines for years. He said that his life had recently headed south, that his son had been killed in Afghanistan and that his truck was being repossessed. He railed against the federal government.

“He was really down on the government,” Jimmy Oliver, 41, one of the three hostages, said in an interview Thursday. “About the government taking over the right to bear arms.”

“He was angry at the government overtaxing us,” he added.

Whether Mr. Taylor served those decades in the Marines is uncertain, with military officials not immediately able to locate records. The Associated Press also could not corroborate whether his son had been killed.

What is certain is that Mr. Taylor, 53, has a criminal record that includes convictions in Manatee County, Fla., in 1994 on two counts of lewd and lascivious behavior with a child under 16 and a count of attempted second-degree murder.
902 2009-12-26 Russia has become the first hockey power to announce the 23-man roster for its men’s Olympic team, picking a squad spearheaded by the high-powered N.H.L. forwards Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin and Ilya Kovalchuk.

But nine players from the Russian K.H.L. were also chosen Friday by Coach Vyacheslav Bykov and General Manager Vladislav Tretiak, including the high-scoring line of Alexei Morozov, Danis Zaripov and Sergei Zinoviev. Morozov and Zaripov play for Ak Bars Kazan, the K.H.L. playoff champion; Zinoviev skates for Salavat Yulaev Ufa, the regular-season champion.

Eight members of the squad were on the teams that won the International Ice Hockey Federation world championships in 2008 and 2009. Russia beat Canada in the tournament final both years, the first time in Quebec City on an overtime goal by Kovalchuk, a forward for Atlanta.

Russia has not won an Olympic gold medal since 1992.

“We have defeated Canada in the finals of the world championship in the last two years,” Kovalchuk told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti on Friday. “I hope we will do the same at the Olympics.”

Russia’s forwards are a formidable group. Ovechkin (Washington) and Malkin (Pittsburgh) have each won an N.H.L. scoring title. Ovechkin has also been the league’s most valuable player twice. Pavel Datsyuk (Detroit) has twice been named the league’s best defensive forward.

Another forward, Alexander Radulov of Salavat Yulaev, broke his Nashville contract to jump leagues in July 2008, exacerbating a feud between the N.H.L. and the K.H.L. Radulov scored the goal that beat Canada in last May’s I.I.H.F. world championship final in Switzerland.
903 2009-12-26 Iran had previously said that it would accept such an exchange only on its own territory.

The United States and its allies have demanded that Iran accept the terms of the United Nations-brokered plan without changes.

Under the plan, drafted last month, Iran would export its low-enriched uranium for further enrichment in Russia and France, where it would be converted into fuel rods. The rods, which Iran needs for a research reactor in Tehran, would be returned to the country about a year later.

Exporting the uranium would temporarily leave Iran without enough stockpiles to further enrich the uranium into the material for a nuclear warhead, and the rods that are returned could not be used to make weapons.

Iran says it has no intention of building a bomb, maintaining that its program is for generating electricity.

At various times, Iran has proposed swapping material in batches, which would not necessarily reduce its ability to build a bomb. At other times it has insisted on a simultaneous swap inside Iran, or threatened to produce the fuel rods on its own.

Mr. Mottaki said that the West needed to prove its good intentions toward Iran first.

“Exchange is acceptable,” he said. “They have to do the trust-building; then it is pursuable.”

Iran is able to produce the fuel on its own, Mr. Mottaki said, calling this a “preferable” option, while adding that Iran is still ready for talks with the West.

“The ball is in their own court,” he said. “They should answer us. Threat and sanctions are useless.”

Low-enriched uranium is used to fuel a nuclear energy reactor, but highly enriched uranium can be turned into a nuclear warhead. Once converted into rods, the uranium cannot be enriched further.

The United Nations has demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment, a demand that Tehran has refused, saying it has a right to develop the technology for peaceful purposes under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Iran has also announced that it intends to build 10 new uranium enrichment sites, drawing a rebuke from the United Nation nuclear watchdog agency.
904 2009-12-26 “Our recession’s going to start now,” Mr. Leger said in his office, which has a “Buy American” sticker stuck to one of the wood-paneled walls, near an old picture of a young John F. Kennedy standing beside a bygone official at the local. “This year will be our first year of real recession for the local, unless we land some big jobs. Next year will be a little difficult for a lot of guys to make their hours.”

Hours are key. Union laborers must work 1,000 hours a year to keep their health insurance and earn credit toward their pensions. In lean years they will sometimes travel 90 miles to jobs, even to areas that pay less, to make sure that they get enough hours to qualify for their benefits.

No one is quite sure where their hours will come from next year. Mr. Smith hopes to go back to his stimulus project on Route 2. But some of his colleagues are not sure what lies in store.

Barry Flynn, 44, has not worked since August, when his job on a gas pipeline wrapped up. William Marks, 54, has seen good times and bad times since joining the union in 1978, but he does not know what to expect. Steve Begnoche, 43, who did a lot of the high-altitude work at the beginning of the decade on the new bridge over the North Nashua River behind the union hall, said he did not know what would replace all the jobs that were done now that the new factories at Devens were finished. In the meantime, some plan to look for odd jobs this winter: some carpentry work, perhaps picking up after an ice storm, or driving a snowplow.

They are hoping that the stimulus spending will help fill the gap. The state has plans to use some of the money to improve the rail line from Fitchburg to Boston, cutting the commuting time to under an hour. Another bridge is planned for the Nashua River in nearby Clinton. But the first year went slowly.

Through the end of November, when the construction season ended, Massachusetts had started work on projects worth less than half of the $437.9 million in highway money it received from Washington, according to figures from the state, and had spent less than $30 million in actual outlays to contractors. Like many other states, it had a loose definition of “shovel-ready.”

Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chided the state this fall for the pace of its stimulus work. Mr. Oberstar wrote to Gov. Deval Patrick in October warning that the state was one of the slowest to get its stimulus work started.

But state officials noted that, unlike other states, Massachusetts had already ramped up its road and bridge building programs before the stimulus legislation passed. So rather than spending its stimulus money quickly on paving projects, as some states have, Massachusetts chose projects that were a bit more complicated but that officials believe will continue to spur economic development long after the laborers go home. One example is a road project in Somerville, near Cambridge, that officials say will help spur the development of the area with a new Ikea store, office space, stores, housing and a transit stop.

Jeffrey B. Mullan, the secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, said in an interview that each state should use its stimulus money to address its particular needs, and that Massachusetts would beat all its deadlines.

While giving a tour of the city, Joe Melanson, 59, the former manager of Local 39, said that what he would most like to see from Washington was an old-fashioned jobs program.

“Work is work,” Mr. Melanson said, as he pointed out evidence of all the work that had fled — the paper plant that closed this year, which once made the river run green and red when it was making colored paper; the site of the old shoe factory, the former Iver Johnson gun factory. “Work is work.”
905 2009-12-26 Teenagers’ growing mindfulness about money is influenced, of course, by the way their parents are cutting back, and by a record-high teenage unemployment rate. But the biggest factor, according to the teenagers themselves, is that they have come to understand the social moment.

“As me and my brothers get older and we realize the implications of the recession,” said Sarah Berger, 16, “we just kind of value presents and gifts less.”

Ms. Berger was among more than a dozen teenagers talking about shopping and spending last week at a roundtable in Armonk, N.Y. Similar gatherings have taken place across the country, all of them organized and moderated by John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who uses the sessions to glean insights about the health of the teenage retailing market. A reporter asked to attend the New York meeting, which took place one night around a dining room table in the home of David Taitz, 16.

While a couple of students said they felt slightly more optimistic this year, mainly because their parents still had jobs, most said thrift was the reigning household theme. Teenagers who celebrate Hanukkah, for instance, said they received one gift instead of presents on each of the holiday’s eight nights. Additionally, many parents had spoken with their children ahead of Christmas to lower expectations.

“I know my mom was saying that we’re going to spend a little bit less this year,” said Katharine LaMantia, 16. “We’re each getting either one big gift or a couple of smaller gifts. And I’m not going to buy as many gifts for my friends because we’re trying to spend less than we did last year.”

Mr. Morris, who has led several retailing discussions with teenagers, said that unlike last holiday season, when the economic crisis was still new, teenagers now understood that nearly everyone was making sacrifices. “What we’re hearing more and more is that these teens are empathizing with their parents,” he said. “They’re more concerned.”

No major retailing chain has felt the effects of that concern as much as Abercrombie & Fitch, the pricey, preppy clothing purveyor that has turned in 19 consecutive months of same-store sales declines. Last month, its sales sank 17 percent.

Rachel Kaplan, 16, said the chain was once a top trendy destination. “Now I walk in there, it’s empty,” she said. “I think it’s because they charge $80 for a polo shirt.”

While Abercrombie is suffering, Aéropostale, the value-priced clothing chain for teenagers, has fared well in this economy, posting record monthly sales figures. Last month, same-store sales rose 7 percent.

“I don’t mind it because it’s kind of the same thing as Abercrombie and Hollister but a little cheaper,” said Bryan Dunn, 17, “so you’re not spending like $40 for a T-shirt.”

The students want low prices, but at the same time, they seem to be discovering the relationship between price and quality. “If a shirt costs $10 but then rips every month or so, that’s a lot of T-shirts,” Ms. Kaplan said. “It adds up. Whereas if you buy a shirt that costs like $30 but it doesn’t rip, you can have it for as long as you want to wear it.”

That sentiment may explain why some teenagers are gravitating to the Gap, which is trying to pull off a turnaround. November same-store sales at Gap were unchanged from the same month last year, when they fell 10 percent. That is a better performance than most of Gap’s competitors.

“That’s your confirmation that teens are much more practical-minded,” said Mr. Morris, the BMO analyst. “You know you can just go in and get basic things and that the price is right. That to me is the confirmation that for them it’s not all about status labels and chasing trends. It’s more about enduring quality.”

The teenagers said they were also shopping more at TJ Maxx, which sells designer brands at affordable prices. As it turns out, TJX Companies, which owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, just had its best quarter ever. The chain reported an 8 percent same-store sales increase in November, and retailing analysts said it was taking market share from teenage clothing stores.

Plenty of teenagers shop with money from their parents, yet many at the roundtable also had jobs baby-sitting, tutoring, delivering food from local restaurants and refereeing local sports games. Most were able to find some kind of part-time work, though Michelle Cioffoletti, 16, said it was more difficult these days.

“I think it’s kind of competitive because more people are losing their jobs,” she said, “so even the job that used to be easy to get for a teenager now is being filled by someone who got laid off.”

The teenage unemployment rate is at a record high, more than 26 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to an overall unemployment rate of 10 percent. One reason is that retailers hired fewer seasonal employees, which analysts at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research said had hurt chains that sell to teenagers.

Those statistics and other uninspiring economic reports are inescapable even for teenagers whose parents do not tend to discuss finances around the dinner table. The teenagers said they could see the impact that news reports about the economy had on their parents.

“It’s nothing you can run away from,” Ms. Cioffoletti said.
906 2009-12-26 Open Letter published its first title, a collection of essays by the Croatian novelist Dubravka Ugresic called “Nobody’s Home,” in September 2008, just as the economic crisis was erupting. But more than a year earlier, to herald the book’s arrival and attract potential readers, Open Letter had begun a blog called Three Percent (rochester.edu/threepercent), a mordant reference to the literary ghetto to which translation is consigned

Though it might have initially been conceived as a marketing device, Three Percent has turned into a lively clearing house for everything related to literature in translation, and logs more than two million page views a year, with obvious commercial benefits for Open Letter. Readers can post their own reviews and learn what foreign publishing houses are up to, and translators can discuss their craft and check to see which works are available and which have already been snatched up by colleagues.

“It’s very difficult in the present economic climate for a publishing house to be totally dependent on university funding, and in the press, editors have less space for reviews and translations,” said Peter Bush, vice president of the International Federation of Translators, who is translating a collection of short stories from Catalan for Open Letter. “But there are readers out there communicating with each other about translation, and through Three Percent, Open Letter is plugged into the new media and is using that space to find new readers and sell their books.”

A seven-member selection committee that includes University of Rochester faculty chooses the titles Open Letter publishes. While members of that group say they would not be averse to picking a book that could become a best seller — the Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson’s trilogy of crime novels having shown once again that American readers will embrace certain books not written in English — they say that is not their principal goal.

“We want the openness in the name Open Letter to register,” said Joanna Scott, a professor of English here who is the author of nine novels. “What we are looking for is excellent work, from any language, eclectic modern fiction that is overlooked. Commerce does not enter the discussions; I wouldn’t know a commercial book if I saw one.”

To increase Open Letter’s reach, Mr. Post talks about finding ways to tap into specialized audiences, like the people who go to movie theaters known for showing foreign films. One thing he has already done is to ensure that all of Open Letter’s books have the same distinctively lean, uncluttered design, almost as if he were running a specialty jazz label like Blue Note or Impulse!, which built a loyal cadre of customers through a combination of a signature look and sound.

“They’ve been really smart in creating immensely eye-catching books that readers are going to pick up when they see them in a store window or on a friend’s bookshelf, just because they are so interesting-looking,” said Paul Yamazaki, lead buyer at City Lights in San Francisco. “Their books really stand out. They’re creating a house identity with visual cues, and with all the choices that readers have these days, that helps, especially when most of what you’re doing is introducing writers new to Americans.”

In line with that concept, Open Letter, like Archipelago Books, also offers a subscription service. For $100 a year (or $60 for six months), a reader can receive each of the books that Open Letter publishes during that time: that works out to $10 a title, with shipping costs within the United States thrown in as a bonus.

“We have to be different, and subscriptions are a part of that,” Mr. Post said. “We want to create the idea that we publish a certain kind of book, and that you can trust in us.”

An additional element of Open Letter’s branding effort is a parallel Literary Translation Studies program at the University of Rochester, which now offers an undergraduate certificate in that field and will soon expand to include a master’s degree. Students enrolled in the program, who speak languages as diverse as Russian and Japanese, not only translate works of fiction for course credit, but also often serve internships at Open Letter, where some read and report on works that might interest the publisher.

“I’d never have known anything about any of this had I not taken this course and done the internship,” said Lillian Miller, a 21-year-old senior, who has spent time in Siberia. “But now I’m considering publishing as a career.”

University officials said they were pleased at the way the press had raised the institution’s profile, both in the academic world and locally, and talk of expanding its efforts. Last year Open Letter organized a joint reading here by Salman Rushdie and Umberto Eco, which was also sponsored by the PEN World Voices Festival, the festival’s first event held outside New York City.

“Before we signed off initially, we looked at the potential costs and benefits and decided we could make this a mecca for the academic study of translation, as well as publication,” said Joel Seligman, the president of the University of Rochester. “Certainly we have no anxieties to date. To continue to be able to publish quality books, and conceivably more of them over time, is a most exciting prospect.”

Next year Open Letter plans to broaden its mission and publish its first collection of poetry. Translators, as might be expected, are especially delighted to see the press’s emergence and are flocking to Open Letter with ideas for new and adventurous projects.

“Open Letter has become important all out of proportion because it is willing to take a chance on work in languages that are not well known in the United States, like Icelandic or Lithuanian,” said Clifford Landers, who has translated the Brazilian writer Rubem Fonseca’s collection “The Taker and Other Stories” for Open Letter and hopes to do more. “Commercial publishing houses have become infected with the jackpot mentality. But Open Letter creates an outlet for works that are not expected to have broad popular appeal but nonetheless are of important value in a literary sense.”

911 2009-12-27 MANILA (AP) — A passenger ferry sank in the northern Philippines, in a second maritime disaster in three days. Three bodies were recovered and 22 were missing, the coast guard said Sunday.

Search-and-rescue teams rescued 63 passengers and crew of the ferry, the MV Baleno-9, and were scouring the seas for others still unaccounted for, the coast guard said in a statement.

It quoted survivors as saying the vessel took in water coming from the bow ramp and listed before going under while traversing the area of Verde Island passage off Batangas Province south of Manila.

On Christmas Eve, a wooden-hulled ferry with 73 people on board collided with a fishing vessel near the mouth of Manila Bay, with 24 people still missing. Three bodies and 46 survivors have been recovered from that accident, which prompted President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to suspend operations of the companies involved in the collision. Officials suspected Thursday’s accident was caused by human error, but a formal inquiry was expected to begin Monday.

Sea accidents are common in the archipelago because of tropical storms, badly maintained boats and weak enforcement of safety regulations.

Last year, a ferry overturned after sailing toward a powerful typhoon in the central Philippines, killing more than 800 people on board.
912 2009-12-27 The senator leading the campaign, Jaromir Stetina, 66, may seem an unlikely anti-Communist firebrand: his grandmother was one of the founding members of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. But Mr. Stetina, a former war correspondent, argued that the unreconstructed party was a dangerous relic.

“We believe the Communist Party should be suspended until they give up the title of ‘communist’ and denounce Marx and Lenin, who regarded violence as a legitimate means of gaining power,” Mr. Stetina said. “Not even the millions of dead bodies, which are the consequence of Lenin’s policies, have convinced the Czech Communist Party to abandon his teachings.”

Mr. Stetina and his commission have been sifting through dozens of past speeches and statements by the party in search of transgressions against democracy.

Their campaign was given impetus during the recent Velvet Revolution anniversary celebrations in November when the Communist Party issued an incendiary statement lambasting the democratically elected governments that followed the revolution for 20 years of “promises and lying.” Czechs, the Communist Party contended, had not wanted to discard communism in 1989.

Unlike the Communist parties in countries like Poland and Hungary, which transformed themselves after 1989 into more mainstream center-left parties, the Czech Communist Party has studiously avoided a comprehensive overhaul. Yet it is still flourishing and gained nearly 13 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary elections in 2006. Its supporters are mostly those fed up with politics as usual and regime nostalgics, many of them elderly pensioners, for whom life before 1989 seems better than life today.

The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, named after the two main regions of the Czech Republic, is the successor of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. While the party has sought to distance itself from its violent past, its many critics contend that it never really cut its umbilical cord to its pre-1989 predecessor — a contention the party vehemently denies.

Vojtech Filip, the Communist Party’s leader, was adamant in an interview that the party did not support undemocratic regime change. But he fell short of condemning the Marxist principle of revolution and called Marx “the greatest thinker of the millennium.”

“We are a legal party and always act according to the Constitution,” he said.

Defending his party’s philosophy, Mr. Filip paradoxically invoked Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led the revolution that overthrew Communism, arguing that Mr. Havel himself had equated contemporary Czech politics with “mafia-capitalism.”

Mr. Havel, who languished in prison under the Communist regime, has also, in fact, called the Communist Party “a boulder weighing down” the political system. But many Czechs blame him for refusing to ban the party when he became president or to put on trial a system that allowed people to send their neighbors to labor camps. Some saw in his approach a noble effort to avoid polarizing the nation; others consider it a moral lapse that prevented the country from coming to terms with its past.

Lubos Dobrovsky, a former dissident and defense minister, who ran Mr. Havel’s office when he was president, argued that it was not possible to ban the Communist Party in the immediate aftermath of 1989 because the reform wing of the party had been an essential ally during the transition to democracy, and helped avoid violence.

But he acknowledged that Czech politicians, including himself, had been naïve in thinking the party would just disappear. “We thought we could overcome them with our own programs, and we were wrong,” he said.

Mr. Havel himself recently stood by his decision not to ban the party but said he nevertheless regretted that former Communists had prospered after 1989 while those they persecuted had suffered.

“I regard it as very sad that people who struggled to ensure freedom and were persecuted their entire life retire with a microscopic pension,” he said recently at an event marking the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, “while their tormentors and secret policemen have huge salaries and are successful entrepreneurs.”

While many Czechs today are outwardly hostile to the Communist Party, in the past the party was accepted, even embraced. Founded in 1921, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the country’s first postwar general elections in 1946, with the memory that the Soviet Army had helped vanquish the Nazis still fresh. The party came to power in a coup in 1948.

While a majority of Czechs have no desire to return to the Communist era, Mr. Dobrovsky, the former dissident, said he hoped that the current attempt to ban the party would expose it for what it is, while helping the country come to terms with history.

“The proposal forces the Communists to react and by doing so they will show their true nature,” he said. “When people listen to the Communists’ arguments, they will realize that the party does not belong in a democratic party system.”
913 2009-12-27 Presidents from George W. Bush on back have had aides make similar arguments, of course, with varying success. John F. Kennedy was on vacation in Hyannis Port, Mass., when the Soviets began erecting the Berlin Wall. The elder George Bush was in Kennebunkport, Me., even as he moved troops to the Persian Gulf to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

Bill Clinton was on Martha’s Vineyard when he ordered cruise missile strikes to retaliate for attacks by Al Qaeda on American embassies in Africa; he returned briefly to the White House to address the nation from the Oval Office, even though aides conceded there was no logistical need to be in Washington. Still, in addition to the more presidential setting, the return also afforded Mr. Clinton a chance to escape sleeping on the couch as he was doing in the days after admitting his affair with Monica Lewinsky.

Few presidents were more roundly castigated for their vacations than the second Mr. Bush, who spent a lot of his presidency at his ranch near Crawford, Tex. He was there in the summer of 2001 when intelligence agencies warned of a possible attack by Al Qaeda inside the United States, and he was there again four years later as Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans.

Critics savaged him. The Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization, posted this headline on its Web site in 2006: “Careless in Crawford: Catastrophes Gather While Bush Vacations.” It took aim again in his last month in office as Israel waged war in Gaza: “Bush Refuses to Interrupt His Final Vacation as Middle East Crisis Escalates.”

The center, which is closely aligned with the Obama White House, voiced no complaint about the current president’s vacation. But the conservative Web site Free Republic did. While Americans “are still caught in the grips of the recession,” a posting on the site said last week, “Obama is living like a king with no criticism from the mainstream media.”

Still, pollsters from both parties said Mr. Obama had more leeway for an island sojourn since he was born and partly raised in Hawaii. “People recognize the president works hard, and going home for a break is reasonable for anyone,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. “He’s just lucky home is Hawaii.”

Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist, said Hawaii “did strike me as an odd choice, considering everything,” but added, “I guess he gets somewhat of a pass having spent time there as a kid, and it certainly beats Chicago this time of year.”

Mr. Obama has no relatives remaining in Hawaii since his grandmother died last year and his sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, moved to Washington this year. But he has brought his family here nearly every Christmas since he and his wife, Michelle, had their daughters, Malia, 11, and Sasha, 8. This year, Mr. Obama brought his sister and close friends Eric Whitaker and Marty Nesbitt and their spouses.

Valerie Jarrett, another friend who now serves as a senior White House adviser, also joined the relatives and friends staying in two neighboring rental houses in Kailua. Ms. Jarrett said the setting had a rejuvenating effect on Mr. Obama. “His visits allow him to reconnect with his roots and cherished childhood memories,” she said.

His predecessors likewise established regular retreats. Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan all referred to their getaways in Texas or California as the Western White House. Mr. Bush’s staff even created a Western White House seal to hang during briefings held at Crawford Middle School. But Hawaii, too, served as a Western White House, when Franklin D. Roosevelt set up shop for a time at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu.

For Mr. Obama, coming for Christmas rather than waiting until after the holiday was a break from recent tradition. The last president to leave Washington regularly for Christmas was Jimmy Carter, who went home to Plains, Ga. Both Reagan and Mr. Clinton celebrated Christmas in the White House (except for 1988, when Reagan went to California), while the two Bushes preferred Camp David. Only after the holiday would those presidents leave town for vacations, a schedule that was less disruptive to their staffs and Secret Service agents.

Since arriving on Thursday, Mr. Obama has mostly stayed out of sight, emerging from the house only to travel to a nearby Marine base for early morning workouts, some holiday greetings and six hours of golf with some friends on Saturday.

But he complained before arriving that his new role might restrict favorite activities like body surfing.

“The Secret Service these days does not like me doing it,” he told American Urban Radio Networks. “The last time I tried it, they had a bunch of people out on jet skis in the water and surrounding me with all kinds of stuff, and it was a little distracting for the other swimmers. So I don’t know if I’ll get out there this year, but I tell you what, I will definitely be enjoying some sun.”
914 2009-12-27 SEOUL, South Korea — An American missionary carrying a letter for the North Korean dictator crossed illegally into the reclusive country to try bring international attention to the North Korean suffering, South Korean activists said Saturday.

“I am an American citizen,” Robert Park, 28, said as he crossed the frozen river separating China from North Korea on Friday, according to Jo Sung-rae, head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group based in Seoul. “I am coming here to deliver God’s love. God loves you.”

By early Sunday, there was no word of his fate from North Korea.

Before heading to China last week to make the journey, Mr. Park said he was determined to become a “martyr” for the tens of thousands of people said to be incarcerated in North Korea’s infamous concentration camps, Mr. Jo said.

In a videotaped message he made before the trip, Mr. Park said he wanted to be arrested and had no intention of leaving North Korea voluntarily until it shuts down its camps. He also said he did not want President Obama to “buy his freedom.”

In August, former President Bill Clinton led a delegation to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, American journalists who were detained in North Korea for nearly five months after crossing the river border illegally.
915 2009-12-27 FLORHAM PARK, N.J.  If Darrelle Revis were building the ideal cornerback from scratch, he would start with the footwork of Deion Sanders, add the vision of Ty Law and mix in Darrell Green’s speed, Champ Bailey’s hands and Charles Woodson’s athleticism.

His cornerback would do it all: shadow the speediest receivers and bump the tallest off their course, run, leap, tackle, intercept. His cornerback would double as a defensive magician, the player who makes elite wideouts disappear each week.

To his Jets teammates, Revis’s ideal cornerback sounds something like Revis, their shutdown corner and most valuable player. Because although Revis approaches the level of the players that he listed, his game is not defined by speed, or strength, or any single attribute, but rather by the totality of his skills.

“You’ve got to have it all,” he said. “I look at myself sometimes on film, and I’m like, how did I just do that?”

On Sunday in Indianapolis, Revis will attempt to add Reggie Wayne to his milk carton of missing receivers  Andre Johnson, Randy Moss, Marques Colston, Steve Smith, Roddy White and Terrell Owens  and bolster his case for N.F.L. defensive player of the year.

Already, Revis is close to the majority of his season goals, as outlined on the paper on his coffee table. They include team player, leader, best cornerback in football, eight interceptions (two away), 50 tackles (one away), Pro Bowl, playoffs and Super Bowl.

“When I look at my game, I see that the people who surround me have basically built me into a machine,” he said. “Like I’m made up of all these parts.”

Part 1: memory. In his rookie season, Revis watched film with safety Kerry Rhodes. He did not understand the difference between watching and studying. Now in his third year, Revis studies film daily, during meetings and from 60 to 90 minutes on his own.

This season, Revis stopped viewing run plays, because he reacts to those instinctively. Instead, he watches every play from the current season, dozens of times, of the next receiver he will face.

First, he looks for body language. Does the receiver tilt his shoulders forward on a pass play? Has he run go routes with his left foot forward at the line? Does he pop and flex his fingers before running across the middle?

Revis does not play poker, but he said every player has tells, including him. The key is finding what separates a Moss from a Colston, then exploiting that.

“It’s all about memorization,” he said. “I’m in the walk-through calling out routes and formations. To the public eye, in the game, it looks easy. And it is, if you’ve seen it dozens of times and you know what’s coming.”

Part 2: muscle. Revis does additional off-season training at Fischer Sports. He lifts monster truck tires, pulls sleds and runs up mountains in the brutal Arizona heat.

Each week, they hold Festivus Fridays, where fellow professionals like Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb and Revis run through 8 to 10 drills without a break, stop for “halftime,” then perform every drill again.

This year, Revis and his trainer, Will Sullivan, studied each receiver he would face this season and trained accordingly. Revis drew additional motivation from Adrian Wilson, the Arizona safety who followed a Super Bowl appearance by training the same way.

The result: Revis said that he rarely tired during games.

“He just attacks his job,” Coach Rex Ryan said. “If there is one guy I want to cover somebody, with my paycheck on it, I want it to be Darrelle Revis.”

Part 3: mind-set. When Dennis Thurman joined the Jets’ coaching staff last off-season, Revis, already a Pro Bowler, started an early conversation with two words  coach me. Thurman found Revis more advanced than cornerbacks with similar experience, ahead in technique, fundamentals, and knowledge, but still, Revis wanted most to learn.

In Revis, Thurman found the most competitive of cornerbacks, the kind of guy who wishes he could cover the Hall of Famer Jerry Rice. In the off-season, Revis studies the greats at his position, even shoots text messages to Sanders for advice.

Revis plays with a quiet swagger and an unshakable confidence. That came from his uncle Sean Gilbert, a longtime N.F.L. defensive end. Gilbert remains Revis’s harshest critic, but even he does not seem surprised by his nephew’s progress.

For nose tackle Kris Jenkins, the only benefit to being injured is watching Revis’s development. Jenkins said Revis loved his job and he would pay to watch Revis play. Player to player, those are two of the highest compliments around.

“It’s because of guys like Revis that the Jets will turn the corner,” Jenkins said.

By taking away the elite receivers of opponents, Revis allows the Jets flexibility in their defense. Safeties that may otherwise help him are free to defend against other players, or the Jets can overload zones and force quarterbacks to throw toward Revis, which explains his N.F.L.-leading 30 passes defended.

Praise comes from coaches and opposing quarterbacks. Ryan spent 10 minutes recently arguing for Revis as defensive player of the year, an award last snagged by a cornerback (Sanders) in 1994. More telling, New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees said he was hesitant to throw in Revis’s direction.

“It’s how complete he is more than anything,” Thurman said. “I hesitate to compare him, because he’s so rare and I want to be fair to him. That’s how good he is.”

Still, Revis knows more work lies ahead. Thurman noted that in practice, Revis occasionally watched the quarterback instead of covering his man. Gilbert pointed to the potential interceptions that Revis dropped the past two games.

Sometimes, Thurman must remind himself that Revis is only in his third season, not yet at his prime. Just think, Thurman said, where Revis will be in two years, after five seasons  and all of 26 years old.

Told that his nephew feels like a machine, Gilbert laughed.

“We’ve got a long way to go,” he said. “Right now, Darrelle is a dune buggy. We want him to become a racecar.”

And maybe, if the progress continues, the ideal cornerback.
916 2009-12-27 Brianna Lynn Orton and Bryan Marcus McCarty were married Wednesday evening at the Eldridge, a hotel in Lawrence, Kan. The Rev. Paul McLain, an Episcopal priest, officiated.

The bride and bridegroom, both 25, graduated from Drake University in Des Moines, where they met.

Mrs. McCarty is a third-year law student at Brooklyn Law School. She is a daughter of Cynthia Lynn of Lawrence and Steven K. Orton of Kansas City, Mo. The bride is a stepdaughter of Coleen Orton.

Mr. McCarty is a third-year medical student at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y. He is a son of Mary Lew McCarty and Marcus C. McCarty of Leawood, Kan.
917 2009-12-27 You could say that parts of “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown: The Musical” are thigh-slappingly funny. That’s the way a little girl in Row F expressed her appreciation last Sunday at the Two River Theater Company. But those moments, alas, were few and far between.

Not that this production doesn’t have its pleasures. Snoopy, not surprisingly, is the star. Richard Ruiz, in his fuzzy beagle suit, sings about the joys and anxieties of suppertime; turns a water dish and a bone into a straw hat and cane for his big number; dons his World War I flying ace goggles and scarf to battle the Red Baron from atop his doghouse; endures attacks by his bird pal, Woodstock; and gets the last word — the last note, actually — when the glee club tries to sing “Home on the Range.” The rich Shakespearean voice that Mr. Ruiz gives Snoopy is just what Charlie Brown’s noble dog deserves.

And if Cate Blanchett has brought complex new meaning to Blanche Dubois in “A Streetcar Named Desire” this season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Lauren Singerman has brought almost as much new emotional complexity to Lucy, the resident bossy kid in the world of “Peanuts.” When her brother Linus (Matt Mundy) tells the truth about her unlikability, she concludes, “I don’t deserve to breathe the air I breathe,” and we believe that she means it, in her way. But Lucy’s glorious moment comes after receiving others’ advice to live as if this day were her last on earth. Naturally she runs in circles, screaming, “Oh, no, this is the last day!”

“Peanuts,” the comic childhood world that Charles M. Schulz brought to newspaper readers in more than 18,000 strips between 1950 and 2000, has always been bleak. Charlie Brown and his compatriots were children of the anxiety-ridden, atomic-bomb-haunted 1950s, and one could argue that the century never got much better.

Somehow, acknowledging those fears and giving Charlie Brown a voice made “Peanuts” strangely reassuring. In this rendering of “You’re a Good Man,” that voice seems far too faint.
918 2009-12-27 The group argues that the church hasn’t adequately explored alternatives to tearing down the rectory.

Renée Kahn, the founder and director of the Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, another Stamford preservation group, is also critical of the church’s decision to let RMS bulldoze the rectory. “It’s like selling off your heritage,” she said.

The challenges facing St. Andrew’s, though not new to urban churches, have become far more visible of late at parishes throughout Connecticut, said Greg Farmer, a preservation specialist with the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. Demographic changes, dwindling congregations and changing worship styles have combined to make it increasingly difficult to maintain aging church buildings that originally went up as prominent community landmarks, he said.

Earlier this year, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford closed Sacred Heart Church, built in 1851 in the Hill section of New Haven. The archdiocese has so far stayed mum about what it intends to do with the building.

In South Norwalk, the First United Methodist Church, a yellow brick Romanesque structure on West Avenue, was deconsecrated and put on the market in 2008. Although there has been some interest in converting it to other uses, it remains for sale, said Ray Rumer, a real estate agent and former parishioner.

Demolishing landmark church buildings can be a real loss to communities because of what they contribute to the streetscape and neighborhood character, Mr. Farmer said. Many have been successfully converted to performance spaces, restaurants and condominiums.

The members of St. Andrew’s, too, would prefer that their rectory be preserved, but they simply can’t afford it, Mr. Alton said. The church has just 65 pledging households, and relies on additional income from a city arts program for troubled teenagers and a day care center that use their facilities, he said.

Over the past year, Mr. Alton said, the church’s financial situation has deteriorated to the point that he had to lay off the music director.

“This is the sixth development deal that the parish has gone through since 1975,” he said. “I watched the last deal collapse last year, and then I watched the value of commercial land plummet, and then saw many of my people lose their jobs.”

Under the current deal, he said, RMS is helping to keep the church afloat by paying a monthly lease amount until the sale goes through.

In essence, said Randy Salvatore, the president of RMS, St. Andrew’s is sacrificing the rectory to save the church. Proceeds from the sale will be used to build a single-story parish hall and make repairs to the 148-year-old church.

Ms. Kahn (who is not involved with the lawsuit) said she had worked on two other rectories in Stamford that, with aid from city and state agencies, were converted to alternative housing. St. Andrew’s has yet to pursue such a possibility, she said.

The last developer talked about saving the rectory by moving it to another part of the property, but Mr. Salvatore said that plan never moved beyond preliminary phases, partly because the numbers didn’t add up.

In a Superior Court hearing earlier this month, Lynn Temple, a construction manager for the Turner Construction Company of Milford, testified that converting the rectory for residential or public use would cost anywhere from $1.7 million to $2.7 million, based on conceptual estimates he performed at St. Andrew’s request.

But the lawyer for Save Old Stamford, Glenn Gazin, questioned the accuracy of the estimates, noting that Mr. Temple had spent only 90 minutes at the rectory before making his calculations and had not had the benefit of a detailed engineering report.

The group is seeking precise documentation of the financial arrangements involving RMS, the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut, of which St. Andrew’s is a parish.

At the hearing, lawyers for both sides expressed willingness to explore the possibility of a settlement.

Mr. Salvatore maintains that time is of the essence. “Quite honestly,” he said, “if this deal doesn’t happen, not only does the rectory building continue to deteriorate, but the church could shut down as well.”
919 2009-12-27 Great men in the winter of their lives often treat the writing of their memoirs as a kind of victory lap, but whatever J. M. Coetzee is after in this third volume of his genre-bending auto­biography, it is not self-­congratulation. The first two volumes, unadornedly titled “Boyhood” and “Youth” (and, in contrast to this one, labeled nonfiction), were marked by Coetzee’s decision to write about himself in the third person. In “Summertime” he takes this schism one bracing step farther, by imagining himself already dead. The book is nominally a kind of rough-draft effort by Coetzee’s own biographer, an Englishman named Vincent, to build the case — through transcribed interviews with lovers and colleagues and other figures mentioned by Coetzee in his “posthumously” opened notebooks — for the years 1971-77 as an especially formative period in the late author’s life, “a period,” as Vincent would have it, “when he was still finding his feet as a writer.”

Not much happens to Coetzee, strictly speaking, in those years. Having returned to South Africa from a sojourn in America, he lives in suburban Cape Town with his ailing father — a development especially resonant to readers of “Boyhood,” much of which centered around the lack of attachment, bordering on mutual shame, between father and son. He takes various teaching jobs despite his evident lack of talent for it (academia being, we are told by one of his former colleagues, a profession “full of refugees and misfits”). He rather sentimentally contemplates moving back to, or at any rate near, the ancestral farm his father’s family still owns in the sun-blasted Karoo, even though the exigencies of that life are clearly beyond him. His mother has died; he has a brother, but that brother is “overseas” and, just as in the first two volumes, hardly acknowledged. And, very quietly, he publishes his first book, the bone-dry “Dusklands” — a pair of novellas that offer little hint of the majesty of later novels like “Waiting for the Barbarians” or “Disgrace.” But interestingly, they do (and did, in real life) contain important, offstage characters named Coet­zee. Thus his impulse to metafictionalize himself is perhaps nothing new.

Even Vincent envisions his proposed biography as nothing more than “an obscure book put out by an academic press in England.” He is, as we see in one chapter, not much of a writer himself; and in case we had any doubts about that, Coetzee puts into his mouth the philistine aside that “changing the form” of the book “should have no effect on the content.” Four of the five interviews he conducts are with women — two lovers, a cousin and the mother of a former student; thus Coetzee’s innate inability to connect with women becomes one of the book’s central themes, and on that subject the author of “Summertime,” speaking through these figures from his own past, is unsparing. “There was an air of seediness about him,” says Julia, a married therapist who initiates an affair with the 30-ish Coetzee more or less out of revenge against her unfaithful husband, “an air of failure. . . . In his lovemaking I now think there was an autistic quality.”

The student’s mother — a widowed Brazilian dance teacher who at first takes young Coetzee for a pedophile — is no more generous. “I was a woman,” she recalls, “and he was a boy. He was a boy as a priest is always a boy until suddenly one day he is an old man.”

The interviews are bookended by what Vincent tells us are excerpts from ­Coetzee’s notebooks, written during the period in question and unsuccessfully revised some 25 years later. The half-­finished excerpts themselves — fragments of memory and anecdote — are like parables from which even the “late” Coetzee himself was unable to extract the meaning. Even in the notebooks, he does not grant himself the subjectivity of the first person; and if this is a manifestation of the dry repression that others found so frustrating and off-putting in Coetzee the man (“disembodied” is one interviewee’s word for him), it is also a shrewd technical maneuver by Coetzee the storyteller. There is always something suspect about the mea culpa — particularly in the first person, particularly when one is making art out of it. Thus it is one thing, as Coetzee surely recognizes, for him to write of himself that he was unattractive or awkward or a fool, and quite another to hear such assessments voiced much more credibly by, say, Adriana, the Brazilian widow, with whom Coetzee ultimately becomes so smitten that he enrolls in a dance class she teaches: “He moved as though his body were a horse that he was riding,” she remembers contemptuously, “a horse that did not like its rider and was resisting. Only in South Africa did I meet men like that, stiff, intractable, unteachable.”
920 2009-12-27 Inside, a new instrument panel and center control panel give the MKZ what Lincoln calls a more upscale look. But from the driver’s vantage, it comes across as flat and tired, particularly compared with striking newcomers like the 2010 Buick LaCrosse.

A new 6-speed automatic transmission with a manual control feature called SelectShift improves the 0-to-60 time of the MKZ by about a half-second (7.1 seconds for the front-drive model), Lincoln says. In addition, the all-wheel-drive system has been recalibrated to provide better traction and reduced noise, vibration and harshness.

The engine and transmission work well together and the horsepower of the 3.5-liter engine is fairly competitive — at least based on the numbers — with the Acura TL and Cadillac CTS, which Lincoln identifies as primary competitors. Those competitors, however, offer optional engines with more than 300 horsepower.

On bad roads, the suspension insulates passengers from the biggest jolts, but the ride is rather jiggly and busy — not what you expect in a luxury-brand car. The chassis is willing and the handling is predictable but the driving experience is marred by numb steering. For the driver, it is not very involving.

So what makes the MKZ stand out in the entry-luxury category? Nothing, actually. It is nice, but in most vocabularies, nice is not a superlative and certainly not a selling point — especially for a car whose window sticker can easily balloon past $40,000.

My test car crept close to $44,000. It had the $5,595 Ultimate Package with a 600-watt THX II sound system and a power sunroof; the Ultimate Package also includes the Technology Package (adaptive high-intensity headlights, rain-sensing wipers and ambient lighting) and the Navigation Package (with blind spot detection and a rearview camera). Also bumping up the window sticker were options like white platinum tri-coat paint ($495) and a Sport Appearance Package ($795) with 18-inch wheels and sport suspension.

Part of the reason luxury brands offer an entry-level model is to give buyers an experience they cannot get from nonpremium nameplates. But there’s a problem for Lincoln.

That problem would be the Ford Fusion. Buyers can get many of the features offered by the MKZ in a Fusion, making the MKZ less of an exclusive proposition. The Fusion Sport uses the same 3.5-liter engine and SelectShift automatic as the MKZ. It also has sport suspension tuning, which makes it fun to drive, and is available with all-wheel-drive.

The Sync voice-control system for cellphones and music players is standard on both the Fusion and MKZ, and it now includes a 911 Assist emergency crash-notification feature and Vehicle Health Report, a diagnostic system. And many of the optional features available on the MKZ can be ordered on a Fusion, including blind spot detection, rearview camera, sunroof and voice-activated navigation.

Did I mention that, similarly equipped, the Fusion costs about $9,000 less?

So you don’t get the Lincoln name or the upscale exterior design, but there needs to be more of a difference if Lincoln wants the MKZ to be a serious player in the entry luxury class.
921 2009-12-27 He swept onto the world stage with his hand on Abraham Lincoln ’s Bible and his voice ringing with yes-we-can hope and promise. More than a million people thronged Washington, and many more around the world tuned in by television to watch the son of a black man inherit a White House built partly by slaves. Nothing would ever be the same again.

Or would it? In the end, it was just that, a moment, and how long ago it now seems.

As the year neared its close, the ball gowns had been stuffed in storage, the photographs tucked away in albums and the brimming hopefulness faded into a sense of nervous uncertainty.

Can the man who inspired so many unify the country, or even his own fractious party? Can he provide jobs and health care while taming the deficit? Can he win the war in Afghanistan and the war against climate change?

A year after the moment on the Mall, the challenges feel as deep as ever and the political polarization of Washington even deeper.

But some of Mr. Obama’s efforts seemed to be bearing fruit by year’s end. The economy is growing again. Banks are repaying their bailouts. And his health care plan appears closer than ever to final passage.

Should he push that through in the coming weeks, he will have something significant to celebrate again.

The trick will be keeping the party going longer this time.
922 2009-12-27 I must compliment John Allen Paulos on “Mammogram Math,” which explained the statistics pertaining to mammography screening in younger women. As a physician and breast-cancer survivor, I am naturally inclined to favor screening and early detection, but as a 48-year-old patient whose 3-centimeter cancer was missed on mammography despite annual studies, I am well aware of the limitations.

It is too bad that the government task force did not state its recommendations more clearly. Of course we want to detect aggressive breast cancers in younger women before they spread, but perhaps annual mammograms of low-risk younger women are not the way to do it. The situation is quite different for those with risk factors that change the equation; hence the recommendation to consult your doctor.

In “Mammogram Math,” John Allen Paulos uses a reductio ad absurdum to question criticisms of the guidelines issued by the breast-cancer-screening panel. His reductio ad absurdum, however, which concerns a women’s age when she is screened, seems to work only in a medical profession ignorant of the role of estrogen. It is known that breast cancer occurs when a number of mutations take place in a breast-tissue clone and that many of these mutations are driven by exposure to estrogen and progestin. Hence, the statistical frequency of breast cancer is strictly proportional to the total lifetime exposure of breast tissue to estrogen and progestin. Therefore, it would be much more apt to key initial screening to the number of years since first menses and not to simple age. The timing of first screening should also take into account the number of children a woman has had, because each new child decreases the probability of breast cancer.

John Allen Paulos outlines a trade-off in “Mammogram Math” between the benefits and the costs of false-positive test results in breast-cancer screening in women younger than 50. A critical assumption invalidates his argument. The assumption is that the findings by the government task force on mammography screenings apply to mammography as it is practiced today. This is not the case for two reasons. First, the scientists examined data that were quite old — most of the studies they analyzed date to the ’90s. Second, the panel’s findings do not apply to digital mammograms, the current technology.

My perspective on mammography, based on my experiences as an oncologist and a breast-cancer survivor, is that we should try to improve the method — by strict monitoring of screening facilities, careful training of those who administer the procedure and, in some cases, supplementing mammograms with sonograms. This would minimize risks to women who undergo screening and help radiologists decipher true from false positives. I value mammography because I know it saves lives and suspect that, upon analysis of current data, it might even prove to be cost effective.
923 2009-12-27 The new straight-ahead jazz pianist in New York these days is Danny Grissett, formerly of Los Angeles, resident here since the middle of this decade. A steady, thoughtful musician, he’s been busy in groups led by Jeremy Pelt, Jimmy Greene, Tom Harrell, Steve Wilson and others — bands you might see on a good night at the Manhattan club Smoke. “Form” (Criss Cross), his third album, takes him from the piano-trio format to sextet with trumpet, trombone and tenor saxophone; it takes its cues from the sound of some of the more put-together, futuristic mid-’60s Blue Note records. What’s especially good here is the range between the horn players’ improvising styles. Seamus Blake, the tenor saxophonist, has a broad, wise, slightly impetuous Cheshire cat style, invoking Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane and Mark Turner; the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire’s is hustling, fractured, harmonically abstract; the trombonist Steve Davis’s is old-school melodic, on an even plane of projection.

The New York minimalist composer Phill Niblock had his start in photography, and sometimes listening to his music is basically like looking at a complicated black-and-white image, with endless variations of gray. In “Stosspeng,” a great hourlong piece on his new double CD, “Touch Strings” (Touch Music), he’s recorded two muted electric-guitar drone notes, played by Robert Poss and Susan Stenger, formerly of Band of Susans. Mr. Poss holds down an E, Ms. Stenger an F sharp, and they both veer into F; they create swells with volume pedals and make tiny pitch adjustments with their tuning pegs. That’s it. Things do happen in a foreground sense: certain tones take the lead, rising and subsiding. But if you’ve really got your head in the piece — it could be the third time you hear it on an average sound system, or the first time on a good sound system like the one at Mr. Niblock’s Experimental Intermedia loft in Chinatown, where he played the piece last Monday for his annual solstice celebration — you will hear what’s happening deep inside the sound, through the evolving throb and friction of overtones. It’s great listening.

Ernest Greene, of Perry, Ga., the young singer and producer who records under the name Washed Out, recently made a mix, “The Fantastic Symphony,” at the behest of the blog Platform. (It can be heard at readplatform.com/mixtape-vi-the-fantastic-symphony.) It doesn’t include his own music, but it’s amazing how well it represents the dream-besotted sensibility of his recent album, “Life of Leisure.” One of 2009’s greased-lightning MP3-blog sensations, Washed Out sounds like half 10cc, half Animal Collective; as summer turned to fall it was both celebrated and mocked as “hypnagogic pop,” “glo-fi” or “chillwave.” Basically Mr. Greene makes good, cheap fantasies, gaining power off the disjunction between rough and smooth. This mix includes recent minimal techno (Osborne), ’70s hippie-folk (Khalsa String Band), and the sort of mystical twinkle that you might have heard in the ’80s on the New Age public-radio show “Hearts of Space.” It’s a curious and logical idea on beatific overdrive.

Since summer-breeze dreamscapes still hold their appeal, I’m surprised that more younger heads aren’t turning to Robin Guthrie’s new music for inspiration. During the ’80s and ’90s Mr. Guthrie was the guitarist in the ambient-pop group the Cocteau Twins, and recently he’s been making very good, guitar-based, instrumental records that amount to a kind of inverted surf music — if waves could be ridden upside down, with body and board underwater. A Robin Guthrie song is something like easy-listening 45 played at 33 1/3: everything becomes blobby, and the guitars echo and swirl, growing saccharine and cavernous. (If Washed Out’s music suggests the paradox of cheap lushness, Mr. Guthrie gives you the color-saturated, slightly creepy idyll.) This year there were three examples, all on his own label, Darla: “Angel Falls,” an EP; “Carousel,” an album; and “Songs to Help My Children Sleep,” an October EP whose title may be taken at face value.

“Voladores” (Clean Feed) is this tenor saxophonist’s new album with his band Apparitions. It includes the bassist Drew Gress and two percussionists: Tom Rainey on drum kit and John Hollenbeck on everything else, from vibraphone to “small kitchen appliances” to a second drum kit. (An earlier Malaby record, “Apparitions,” came out in 2003; it had Mr. Rainey and the drummer Michael Sarin.) It’s a free-jazz band with bits of melody and planned group strategies, often taking the form of textural, episodic happenings. But it is the two percussionists, working together and sometimes taking over the group, that make “Voladores” playful and unusual. It also reminds you how strangely restricted and traditional so much other “free” jazz tends to be.
924 2009-12-27 I began my visit at the bottom of the Monumental Staircase, which, according to the Angkor scholar Vittorio Roveda, “symbolizes the laborious path of faith needed to approach the sacred world of the gods.” The 163 gray sandstone steps, partly carved into the living rock, are flanked by statues of lions and, near the top, two magnificent nagas (seven-headed serpents) facing north toward Thailand. Also intently watching Thai territory were several AK-47-toting Cambodian soldiers in camouflage.

The first structure I came to, called Gopura V by generations of archaeologists, was an airy cruciform construction once topped by wood beams and a terra-cotta tile roof. Many of the stones have tumbled over, but the delicately balanced eastern pediment has survived to become Preah Vihear’s most recognizable icon, appearing on publicity posters, patriotic T-shirts and the new 2,000-riel banknote.

In centuries past, this pavilion was where pilgrims from the plains of Cambodia, having just climbed the steep, mile-long Eastern Staircase (mined and inaccessible for decades but soon to reopen), met their counterparts from what is now Thailand, who had completed a rather less-taxing ascent from the Khorat Plateau.

Alongside a group of saffron-robed monks, I continued north on a majestic, sandstone avenue, 800 feet long, to Gopura IV. There, I came upon a particularly vivid bas-relief depicting the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, a Hindu creation myth in which gods and demons churn the primeval waters to extract the ambrosia of immortality.

Although most of the splendid decorative carvings at Preah Vihear, including this one, depict Vishnu, the temple was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. In later centuries, it was converted to use as a Buddhist sanctuary, and today many of the visitors are Buddhist pilgrims.

As I continued my ascent, I walked under exquisite lintels and tympanums depicting more scenes from Hindu epics like the Mahabharata, and beneath richly carved double pediments adorned with finials and upturned gable ends — calling cards of Cambodian and Thai architecture to this day. Ancient inscriptions in Khmer and Sanskrit, bearing cryptic details about the history of the temple and the Angkorian kings who built it, were hidden here and there under a patina of lichen.

The temple’s culminating point, geographically and symbolically, is Gopura I, whose mandapa (antechamber) and Central Sanctuary, now a jumbled pile of carved sandstone blocks, are surrounded by galleries that call to mind a French Gothic cloister, except that here the windows are rectilinear and the galleries covered by corbelled vaults. (The Khmers, for all their architectural genius, never mastered the keystone arch.)

The entire structure is inward-looking, its outer walls almost devoid of openings despite the sweeping views just outside. Scholars speculate that while the site was considered holy in part because of its spectacular situation, the ancient architects may have believed that picture windows would distract both priests and pilgrims from their sacred tasks.

As I approached the rocky tip of the promontory, just beyond Gopura I, a breathtaking panorama came into view. Cambodia’s verdant northern plains extended majestically toward the horizon, and in the distance I could just make out Phnom Kulen, about 65 miles to the southwest, where the Khmer Empire was founded in A.D. 802. (Angkor itself lay hidden in the haze, 88 miles away.)

To the east, toward Laos, and the west, the Dangkrek Mountains stretched into the distance in a series of serrated bluffs. Looking north, almost everything I could see was in Thailand, rendered remote and mysterious by its inaccessibility.

Thailand ruled much of northwestern Cambodia, including Preah Vihear Temple, from the late 18th century until 1907, when the French colonial administration forced the Thais to withdraw to the current international frontier; Cambodian sovereignty over Preah Vihear was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in 1962.

Thailand, despite unresolved land claims, initially supported Cambodia’s Unesco bid for World Heritage status, but the temple soon became a pawn in Thai and Cambodian domestic politics, unleashing nationalist passions in both countries.

In July 2008, according to Cambodian authorities, Thai soldiers intruded into Cambodian territory near the temple. The Thai government denied that any border violations had taken place. Since then, a total of at least seven soldiers from both sides have been killed in intermittent exchanges of fire, according to local news reports. At the time of my visit, though, the frontier had been quiet for several months.

Curious about what the standoff actually looked like, I asked my guide, conveniently a moonlighting army officer, if I could get a glimpse of the Thais. He took me to the bottom of the Monumental Staircase, where I could hear the distant sounds of war — air-raid sirens and shooting — but the combat was taking place on a tiny television, which off-duty soldiers were watching with rapt attention.

We walked along a forest trail past a volleyball court and trenches, passing soldiers in hammocks with their wives stealing a moment of intimacy in an encampment with little privacy, to a forest clearing with a bamboo table at the center.

About 20 yards in front of us stood a line of neatly built bunkers; uniformed men could be seen among the dark green sandbags. “So those are Cambodian soldiers?” I asked, trying to get my bearings. “No,” my guide answered, “those are Thais. Over there” — he turned 180 degrees and pointed to a line of bunkers 20 yards in the other direction — “are Cambodians.” The table, I realized, marked the midpoint of no-man’s land.

The Cambodians’ front-line bunkers, made of disintegrating sandbags sprouting grass, were shaded by blue and green tarpaulins and surrounded by orderly gardens. Their raised observation post, topped by a thatched roof, looked as if it might have been on loan from “Gilligan’s Island.” I was in the middle of a very un-Korean Panmunjom, a laid-back, tropical version of Christmas 1914 on the Western Front.

I soon learned that the Cambodian soldiers stationed there call the site Sambok Kmom, or beehive, because, they say, the area’s many wild bees leave Cambodians unmolested but set upon any Thai who encroaches on Cambodian land. Moved by national feeling, domestic tourists wearing krama (traditional checked scarves that serve as something of a Cambodian national symbol) wandered by, distributing cigarettes and other morale-boosting gifts to the soldiers who were deployed to help the bees protect Cambodian sovereignty.

Around the clearing, soldiers from both sides, unarmed and without body armor or helmets, were relaxing in front of their own front-line bunkers. Cambodian officers seemed to find the bamboo table, shaded by trees tall enough to let breezes through, especially congenial. A few paces away, the Thais had strung a hammock between trees, and one soldier, lounging in a white T-shirt, black combat pants and black military boots, was engrossed in a cellphone call.

Despite the apparent tranquillity, I knew that if the order were given, the men on both sides of the invisible line would not hesitate to shoot. In fact, many of the Cambodian troops stationed around Preah Vihear are battle-hardened former Khmer Rouge fighters. For now, though, relations are casual and, I was told, some wary friendships have developed.

The best staging point for a visit to Preah Vihear Temple is Sra Em (also spelled Sa Em), 19 miles by road from the temple. Two years ago, it was a sleepy crossroads hamlet with a single grimy restaurant and one rundown guesthouse. These days, in the wake of the area’s military buildup, it feels like a Gold Rush boomtown, with haphazardly parked four-wheel-drives instead of tethered horses; karaoke bars sporting pink fluorescent lamps and colored lights, instead of saloons; and the gleanings of Cambodia’s recently doubled defense budget, instead of gold nuggets glinting in the stream. Armed men in camouflage uniforms abound.

Sra Em’s accommodation options are rudimentary, to put it politely. My room’s star amenity was a cold-water spigot for filling the plastic bucket used both to bathe and to flush, and below the cheap plastic mirror and its public access comb, dust bunnies had formed around the hair of guests past. Each time I returned to my room, I found a dead cricket, a new one every day, hinting, perhaps, at the presence of some sinister insecticide.

Preah Vihear Temple is, obviously, not quite ready for mainstream tourism. During the two days I spent at the temple in October, I saw only four other Westerners, including an unhappy German couple whose day trip from Angkor Wat had been rather more trying than expected, and perhaps 50 or so Cambodian tourists. But intrepid travelers who brave the diabolical (though improving) roads, substandard accommodations and alarming government travel advisories are richly rewarded.

For 40 generations, Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims have trekked to this temple, seeking to ascend toward the holy and the transcendent. Today, the awe-inspiring nature of this Angkorian masterpiece, accentuated by the challenges of getting there, confer on every trip the aura of a pilgrimage.

NAIL-BITING TAXI TRIPS AND A VOLCANO AT YOUR TABLE

With the visa-free crossing from Thailand closed for the foreseeable future, getting to Preah Vihear Temple requires battling Cambodia’s famously potholed roads, which are at their worst during the wet season (about June to October).

Share-taxis, which have no set schedule and depart when full, link Sra Em with Siem Reap via the former Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng ($7.50 a person; 130 miles; three hours) and with the provincial capital of Tbeng Meanchey ($6.50; 65 miles; two hours). The U.S. dollar is widely accepted.

The taxis, usually “jacked-up” Toyota Camrys, carry six or seven passengers in addition to the driver, so if you want the front seat to yourself you’ll have to pay two fares. Ante up six times the single fare and you’ve got yourself a private taxi.

From Sra Em, a ride to Kor Muy on the back of a motorbike will run about $3.75. Then the three-mile ride up the mountain to Preah Vihear Temple, on a concrete road whose gradients will impress even San Franciscans, is $5 by motorbike or $20 to $25 by four-wheel-drive pickup.

Glassless windows, sinkless bathrooms, towels with the absorptive capacity of a plastic bag, fans that run only when a generator is sputtering outside your window (usually from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and laissez-faire housekeeping are, alas, the norm in Sra Em’s guesthouses. I should have stayed at the 25-room Tuol Monysophon (855-99-620-757), which opened this year. A brown, barn-like structure topped with a red tile roof, it has basic rooms downstairs with private baths, mosquito nets and wood-plank floors, for $10; smaller upstairs rooms with shared facilities are $7.50. To get there from the triangular crossroads, head west (toward Anlong Veng) for 500 yards.

The Preah Vihear area’s best restaurant, hands down, is Sra Em’s Pkay Prek Restaurant (855-12-636-617), an unpretentious complex of open-air, fluorescent-lit pavilions with plenty of geckos. The specialty is phnom pleoung (hill of fire; $3.75), a meat and veggie feast you grill yourself at your table on an aluminum “volcano” suspended above glowing coals.

Before setting out to Preah Vihear Temple, check the Phnom Penh Post (phnompenhpost.com), the Cambodia Daily or other reliable sources to make sure that Thai-Cambodian tensions are not rising.

According to the Cambodian Mine Action Center (www.cmac.org.kh), the immediate vicinity of the temple is now safe, having been cleared in recent years of more than 8,800 anti-personnel mines. However, nearby areas are still heavily mined, so do not, under any circumstances, wander off the footpaths.

The most useful guidebook in English (and Thai) to the temple’s architecture, symbolism and history is “Preah Vihear” by Vittorio Roveda (Bangkok: River Books, 2000), but it may be difficult to find.
925 2009-12-27 To the Editor: Regarding “Frugal, But With Plenty to Give” (Dec. 20): Thanks for reminding us to give a little back this year instead of worrying about what material goods we can afford to buy for our friends and family. In a recession, why not donate a little time and effort instead of money?

To the Editor: Travelers Aid is wonderful. When I was a returning Peace Corps volunteer landing in Chicago in January in a snowstorm clad in flip-flops, a T-shirt and jeans, they lent me a blanket. I looked so stressed out that the Hare Krishnas offered me money, but the blanket was better.
926 2009-12-27 January and February also have the fewest airline passengers, according to the Department of Transportation, easing the airport experience. And with fewer crowds, you could have that beach or fresh powder trail all to yourself.

So it’s time to shake off that holiday hangover and plan a trip. But don’t just jump at the first cheap fare that comes your way. Think about what you want to do once you get there in order to find the best destination for your budget. Though Florida beckons with bargains, the water can be chilly in the winter, and temperatures, while warm, tend to hover in the 70s or even lower. So you may want to look farther south to the . But if pub crawls and hot springs are your thing, may be just the place, with two-night packages, including flights from New York or Boston, from $499 a person at .

To help you plan your post-holiday escape, here are some of the best bargains for popular winter getaways, whether you’re seeking, sun, snow or a cruise vacation.

lovers: It’s high-season for cold-weather getaways like and the Caribbean, where warm sands beckon sun worshipers, and discounts tend to be scarce. But it’s still a heck of a lot cheaper than it was over Christmas. And some resorts are offering extra incentives to fill rooms in January. on has Summer in January rates from $230 a night, down from $325. On , is offering seven nights for the price of six with its January Thaw package. The deal starts at $3,750 based on double occupancy — $630 less than a similar package over the holidays — and includes daily breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner.

Hawaii’s deals may soon dry up as , , Delta and add flights next year, bringing more visitors. So strike now to nab a bargain like $135 a night with breakfast at the , half a block from Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. On the Kohala Coast, , normally $600 a night, has rooms from $450 with a fourth night free.

Deal seekers may get the most bang for their buck in , which is still offering discounts to win back visitors scared off by reports of Mexican gang and and the H1N1 outbreak earlier this year. Fares are about 40 percent less to in January on average compared with the December holidays, 34 percent less to and 30 percent less to , according to .

Occidental Hotels & Resorts, which has six all-inclusive properties in Mexico, is running a winter sale with rates starting at $81 a person a night at the Allegro Nuevo Vallarta, north of Puerto Vallarta, for travel beginning Jan. 4.

Snowhounds: The snow is falling and so are prices at ski resorts this January. Four nights and three-day lift tickets at the Village at Squaw Valley near Truckee, Calif., start at $828 a person, according to , down from $1,115 a person last January and $1,383 a person in December. Bachelor Gulch Village in , Colo., is offering 25 percent off lodging, a $50 resort and three-day lift tickets for the price of two, bringing four nights in a two-bedroom with three days on the mountain to $642 a person when four people share a room. Last January a similar package was $868 and didn’t include resort credits or the lift-ticket special.

may seem out of reach as it readies itself for the 2010 Winter Olympics in February. But it’s cheap if you go now. “Visitors assume the host city is busy in the months leading up to the Olympics,” said Emily Armstrong, a spokeswoman for Tourism Vancouver. “We’re not.”

For less than $400 a person, skiers can fly round trip to Vancouver from San Francisco or Denver and stay two nights at the Fairmont Hotel with United Vacations, Jan. 11 to 28, according to Travelzoo.com, and hit the local ski slopes at , Cypress and Mount Seymour.

Cruisers: “January is currently the softest-looking month for cruise pricing of the year,” said Evan Eggers of SureCruise.com. The average price of a seven-night cruise on major lines is about $600 a person, he said, compared with $900 in December.

Some cruise lines have adopted airline-style yield-management strategies and are now changing prices multiple times a day, according to Mr. Eggers. Travelers can check for such rate cuts by clicking on Price Cut Tattletale at SureCruise.com and sorting by date, line or region. There was a 7-night Western Caribbean cruise from Galveston, Tex., starting at $420 a person (down from $2,033) on Royal Caribbean, for example, in a recent search for January; a $650 a person (down from $2,464) 14-night Amazon River cruise from to , Fla., on Princess; and a $300 (down from $2,599) seven-night Hawaii cruise on Norwegian.

Another site for spotting deals is , which recently listed three-night cruises starting at $149 in January. And if all you want is a diversion, consider Norwegian’s one-night sail to nowhere on the Norwegian Gem, from just $159 a person. It departs New York on Jan. 2 and 23, cruising about seven miles out to sea so it can open the casino and duty-free shops, and then returns to its starting point.

940 2009-12-28 There was an impasse, until some last-minute political horse-trading, when Republicans lifted the hold on Ms. Sapiro in exchange for getting a Republican, Michael Khouri, a lawyer specializing in shipping issues, confirmed for one of the Republican seats on the Federal Maritime Commission, Congressional staff members said.

But there was no such luck for many other Obama nominees, including Martha Johnson, who was nominated on May 4 to be administrator of the General Services Administration. Ms. Johnson, a former chief of staff for the agency, remains in limbo thanks to Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, who put a hold on her nomination to pressure the government to approve a proposed federal office building in downtown Kansas City.

Mr. Bond and Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, jointly wrote to the General Services Administration in August to protest delays in the project. The agency has said that it is committed to the downtown Kansas City office, but first needs to get financing approved by Congress.

“We haven’t had a permanent administrator in two years,” said Sahar Wali, the agency’s spokeswoman.

“What it does for the psyche of the agency — we’re stuck in transition. It’s like trying to run a business without a C.E.O.” (On Tuesday, an acting administrator was named, the second since the job has been vacant.)

Most of the time when a hold is put on a nominee, it is either because there is a strong ideological objection, or because a senator is trying to extract some sort of commitment from either the nominee or the administration — as was the case with both Ms. Sapiro and Ms. Johnson.

But sometimes there is no overt explanation. On March 24, Mr. Obama nominated Marisa J. Demeo, a magistrate judge in Washington who is openly gay, for a seat on the Superior Court in the District of Columbia. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination on May 20.

But Judge Demeo’s nomination has yet to come to the floor of the Senate, and no one has stepped forward to say why. Other gay nominees have been approved, including John Berry, who is now head of the Office of Personnel Management.

In all, around 500 senior positions in the executive branch need Senate approval, along with a number of vacant judicial seats and other positions for which the president sends nominations to the Senate.

So far, 463 of Mr. Obama’s nominations have been confirmed by the Senate, and 226 are pending.

Administration officials have shied away from publicly criticizing the slow pace of confirmations, for fear of angering the same senators who they are hoping will remove their holds. “We’ve made great progress in confirming nearly 500 of the president’s nominees this year,” a White House official said Thursday. “We will continue to work with the Senate next year to move forward the more than 200 people whose nominations are pending.”

The frustration of trying to get a new team in place while the competing political party exacts revenge on Capitol Hill is by no means new. For instance, in August 2001, when George W. Bush received the memorandum saying that Osama bin Laden was “determined to strike U.S.,” he still did not have most of his national security team in place.

President Obama tried to avoid a similar problem by moving quickly with his national security appointments. But other key jobs remain empty.

In July, Mr. Obama nominated Jacqueline A. Berrien, the associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., to be the chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The nomination remains in limbo.
941 2009-12-28 Athletic departments in the University of California and the California State University systems have not been immune. Most coaches and administrators have taken furloughs and pay cuts, just as professors and staff have been. Budgets have been slashed, sports have been dropped and sharp tuition hikes — 32 percent at U.C. schools next year — have resulted in skyrocketing scholarship costs.

The Cal football team, instead of flying to Los Angeles for a game against U.C.L.A. earlier this season, took buses, saving close to $30,000. San Jose State did the same when it played at U.S.C.

Rick Neuheisel, the U.C.L.A. football coach, uses a helicopter provided by a booster to zip around the Los Angeles area and watch recruits play on Friday nights. But he is among those who have taken a voluntary 10 percent reduction in salary — about $25,000 — even though they are exempt because they are under multiyear contracts.

“I feel like it’s everybody’s responsibility to do what they can,” said Cal’s football coach, Jeff Tedford, who volunteered to take a similar cut. “I’m no different. I want to do what I can do to help along with everybody else.”

The Cal State Fullerton track and cross-country coach, John Elders, could not be so magnanimous. Subject to a mandatory 10 percent pay cut through furloughs, he no longer has a gardener come to his house. Instead, he uses his two furlough days each month to mow the lawn and trim the shrubs.

“I joke that I’m doing my own lawn now, but I’m still paying somebody,” Elders said.

The furloughs, more than anything else, have created consternation among coaches. They are mandatory at the Cal State schools, and while there is some flexibility, all coaches are expected not to report to work — or take any home with them. In theory, that means no coaching, recruiting or any other business two days per month. In reality, it amounts to don’t ask, don’t tell.

“What are they going to do, take away our keys?” said Keith West, the women’s soccer coach at Cal State Northridge. “As a coach, it’s no different than what I tell my players: when you want to be great, you have to put in the extra work.”

Randy Langejans, an associate athletic director at Long Beach State, keeps a calendar of the furlough dates for all 70 full-time coaches and staff in his department. The campus may be shut down, but if a basketball coach, for example, has a game that day, he or she must reschedule the furlough day. Each week Langejans sends out an e-mail message reminding people of their scheduled days off.

How the universities and the athletic departments deal with these matters differs from campus to campus, and sport to sport. Universities with revenue-generating sports like football and men’s basketball receive only a small portion of their budget from state funds, usually 10 to 20 percent. But the economy also has affected ticket sales, sponsorship and private donations.

The Fresno State football team recently played before its smallest home crowd in 23 years. And at U.C.L.A., there were more than 2,000 empty seats at Pauley Pavilion when the Bruins hosted No. 1-ranked Kansas in men’s basketball.

Cal, which is planning to renovate its football stadium and build a new sports complex, is expecting a $6.4 million shortfall. That this comes despite a projected $6 million subsidy has earned the wrath of students and the academic senate, who have questioned the university’s priorities.

At the colleges that do not play football, the enthusiasm for funding athletics is also weak. Last spring, referendums to increase funding for sports were voted down by students at Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge and Cal State Fullerton, all predominantly commuter schools.

“You’ve got the 32 percent fee increase for students, I’m giving 7 percent of my salary back to the state,” said Vince O’Boyle, the track and cross-country coach at U.C. Irvine, which dropped five sports over the summer. “All of a sudden, you ask, where is it going to stop?”

The budget crisis resonates with the Hicks family — Jill, the gymnastics coach, and her husband, Dan, the wrestling coach at Fullerton.

Athletic Director Brian Quinn told them last May that the university would probably drop both sports.

Within days, the Hickses had a plan. Eliminating the sports would save $60,000 on wrestling and $90,000 on gymnastics because scholarships already allocated would be honored and because they were guaranteed their salaries through the academic year. They proposed a stay of their programs if they could raise the operating budgets by the start of school. They were told that was O.K., but that wrestling would have to raise an additional $200,000 and gymnastics $280,000 by May 1, 2010, to continue.

The gymnastics program got to its mark by the end of summer, thanks to $75,000 in contributions from USA Gymnastics, which put word out to its members that the program was in jeopardy. The wrestling program needed longer, but made the mark — in part thanks to an invitational last month that packed the university’s 4,000-seat gym and elicited a $14,000 check from a local doctor.

“Nobody wants to take away opportunities,” said Quinn, the athletic director. “We want them to make it.”

The Hickses, whose salaries have each been reduced by 10 percent through furloughs, say the prospect of losing their jobs does not weigh heavily on them. Their two eldest children are in college, and their youngest is a high school senior.

“We have our moments,” Jill said. “But we have a real peace that we’re doing the best we can.”

Dan, a sports psychologist and former two-time N.C.A.A. wrestling champion at Oregon State, said: “We just try to stay focused on the goal. We don’t want our sports to die. Somebody’s got to fight back.”

When Dan took over in 2004, the wrestling team had not won a dual meet in the Pac-10 (in which it competes in wrestling) in five years. Two years ago, the Titans won the conference dual meet championship. Jill, in her third season, was the 2007 coach of the year in the Western Athletic Conference (in which Fullerton competes in gymnastics) and her team carried a 3.6 grade-point average last year.

More and more, however, they are being pulled away from the gym and toward fund-raising. Soon it may be a requirement.

Peter Vidmar, the chairman of USA Gymnastics, is working on creating a seminar on fund-raising for college coaches. “They want to teach the balance beam — that’s why you get into coaching — but they need to know how to find donors,” he said.
942 2009-12-28 “Society’s problems come to us,” New York’s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, said. “We are the emergency room for society.”

For most court systems nationally, official tallies of cases filed since the 2008 economic collapse are not yet complete. But the New York data, compiled by state court officials after a request from The New York Times, provide an early measure of the wave of recession cases nationally.

Florida officials say there were some 400,000 foreclosure filings there this year, an increase of 446 percent since 2006. In Arizona, officials say eviction cases have tripled in the last year, contract disputes are up 77 percent over the last two years, and there is a notable increase in cases seeking to commit people for mental health treatment because of stress-related conditions.

“The New York experience is representative. That’s what we are seeing here,” said John T. Broderick Jr., the chief justice of New Hampshire’s Supreme Court, adding that many divorce, petty crime and domestic violence cases seem to have their roots in financial troubles.

Steve C. Hollon, an Ohio court official who is president of the Conference of State Court Administrators, said court officials nationally had noticed a growing number of people saying their circumstances were so desperate that they could not afford lawyers, turning virtually every kind of case into a journey through the economy’s rough edges.

The new statistics in New York show the breadth of the recession-related cases — in family, criminal and commercial courts and on across the judicial system. The cases turn the courts into theaters of the economic crisis.

Court administrators said it is likely they have seen only the first wave of recession cases because courtroom battles take time to brew. They said they were bracing for more suits over business disputes, foreclosures, evictions and family disputes as the costs of the downturn continued to be revealed.

New York’s projected caseload this year has risen by some 63,000 cases from last year, which would appear to be a modest increase. But court administrators say the broad impact of the recession is clear in hundreds of thousands of new cases across the judicial system, including people challenging their real estate taxes, home foreclosures, contract disputes and family offenses. The 17 percent increase in statewide home foreclosure filings, for example, is part of an 84 percent climb over the last four years, to nearly 50,000.

The city’s Civil Courts, where suits seeking less than $25,000 are heard, have seen caseloads balloon to more than 577,000 this year, from about 200,000 10 years ago. Court administrators say much of the increase is because of suits over unpaid credit card bills.

“Until you’re standing amidst 40 people who are worried about losing their homes, you can’t really appreciate how significant the whole downturn was,” said Hilary J. Bauer, a lawyer for the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged who represents homeowners facing foreclosure.

Court cases need not be about money to offer a measure of the recession’s impact, said a Family Court judge, Pam Jackman-Brown. From her bench in Queens, she said, every day she sees formerly middle-class families wrenched by anger and fear. A judge, she said, does not always have the answer when family anxiety turns into tussles and shoves, and then into charges of assault or menacing.

“I am seeing the ripple effects that destroy the family structure,” Judge Jackman-Brown said.

In her courtroom, she said, people who were once climbing corporate ladders describe cascading disappointments: phones shut off, child care no longer affordable, couples separated. “You’re trying to wrap your head around all of this,” Judge Jackman-Brown said, “trying to find something that works.”

The ripple effects sometimes seem nearly infinite in the courts. New York judges are working through multimillion-dollar business deals that fell apart. They are processing what some judges call business divorces, the cases that can become as ugly as real divorces when partners turn on each other in bad times.

A hotel development company struck by the downturn argued unsuccessfully in State Supreme Court a few months ago that the “ongoing economic crisis” was akin to an act of God that ought to entitle it to a break in its obligation to pay the owner of the Lower Manhattan plot where the hotel was to rise.

State Supreme Court in Manhattan is at the center of the financial collapse. The view from the bench there lately, judges said, is of one industry after another pushing through the debris left from the last year or so.

Plaintiffs and defendants are the former high-flying hedge funds and investment banks, as well as the city’s less glamorous businesses like restaurants and clothing manufacturers.

“Suppliers are ordering goods, and they end up not being able to pay,” said a State Supreme Court justice, Bernard J. Fried.

The Civil Courts hum with stories of people who got credit too easily, people who are no longer earning what they were and people who are no longer earning anything at all. Sometimes, the debtor is a lawyer or a banker.

A Manhattan Civil Court judge, Anil C. Singh, said he often sees people who cannot afford lawyers but who qualified for one credit card after another in the years when people seemed to think the economy could only go up.

The credit card cases, some judges say, are like the one-act plays of the recession, not as complex as the dramas of foreclosure, but concise and gripping. “You see a lot of people,” said another Civil Court judge, Peter H. Moulton, “who have lost their jobs and were just a paycheck away from being destitute.”

Nationally, court administrators say budget pressures are forcing them to do more with less. That is certain to be the challenge for New York’s 1,253 state judges, said the state’s chief administrative judge, Ann Pfau.

With legal emergencies everywhere, Judge Pfau said, “we’re going to have to be making choices.”

Judge Singh of the Civil Court said that, from his bench, it was hard to see signs of a recovery.

“I would describe it as a train wreck,” he said, “and I think it’s going to get worse for the next couple of years.”
943 2009-12-28 Vincent Geisser, a scholar of Islam and immigration at the French National Center for Scientific Research, believes that the more Europe’s Muslims establish themselves as a permanent part of the national scene, the more they frighten some who believe that their national identity could be altered forever.

“Today in Europe the fear of Islam crystallizes all other fears,” Mr. Geisser said. “In Switzerland, it’s minarets. In France, it’s the veil, the burqa and the beard.”

The large new mosque, which its builders call “the symbol of Marseillais Islam,” is a source of pride here in France’s second-largest city, which is at least 25 percent Muslim. But it is also cause for alarm, Mr. Geisser said, embodying the paradox that visible signs of integration set off xenophobic anxiety. “All these symbols reveal a deeper, more lasting presence of Islam,” he said. “It’s the passage of something temporary to something that is implanted and takes root.”

The change has been significant over the last five years, Mr. Geisser said. “Now we’re at a crossroads,” he said, of a complicated European anxiety that stems from economic crisis; the fear of globalization; the perceived increase in immigration as European birthrates fall; and the subsuming of national states into an enlarged Europe.

“There is an angst over identity in Europe,” he said. “There’s a feeling that Europe is becoming smaller and less important. Europe is like an old lady, who whenever she hears a noise thinks it’s a burglary.” This generalized anxiety and fear is translated into a specific one, he argues: Islam, “a box in which everyone expresses their fears.”

The European Union is believed to have more than 15 million Muslims and perhaps as many as 20 million. France has five million to six million Muslims, the most in Western Europe.

In general, relations between Muslims and other Europeans have been good. But the terrorism associated with attacks in France in 1995 and 2001 in the United States has resonated through the years, reinforced by the Madrid train bombings in 2004; the killing that year of the Dutch film director Theo van Gogh, a critic of conservative Muslims; the London bombings of 2005; and the controversy over Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published the same year.

In 2004, France banned the head scarf (and other signs of religious affiliation) in public schools. It is now debating a ban on the burqa, by which the government seems to mean any full facial covering, including the niqab, which shows the eyes. That controversial measure is caught up in a government-sponsored debate over national identity, led by the ministry that also handles immigration.

Both measures have been widely criticized as political maneuvers by President Nicolas Sarkozy, capitalizing on social fears to unite the center-right and co-opt the far-right National Front before regional elections in March. He has tried to play down the religious element in the debate, but he has also urged Muslims to show “humble discretion” and avoid “ostentation and provocation”; a junior minister, Nadine Morano, said young Muslims should dress better, find jobs and stop using slang and wearing baseball caps backward.

The far-right and anti-immigrant parties did comparatively well in last June’s European elections, which had a low turnout. For the first time, Britain’s far-right party won two seats, and the Dutch Freedom Party secured 17 percent of the vote.

This year, the Danes and the Swiss have brought a new focus to mosques and minarets. Plans for Copenhagen’s first two large mosques have met with strong opposition from the right. The Swiss vote brought widespread condemnation of fear-mongering and racism, including from Switzerland’s own government.

Youcef Mammeri, a writer on Islam in France and member of the Joint Council of Muslims of Marseille, says that the debates over minarets, burqas and national identity have angered many French-born Muslims and brought them together in a defensive circle.

Asked about the source of “this anxiety about Islam,” Mr. Mammeri said: “I ask myself this same question.” He finds “a perverse aspect to all these questions asked Muslims, which are not coherent,” he said, but “liberate and dignify existing racism” and “stigmatize Muslims.”

Racism in France has moved from being anti-Arab to anti-Muslim, he said, “a terrible regression.”

If 10 years ago Muslims debated politics and assimilation, “today everyone agrees and reacts the same way,” Mr. Mammeri said. “They feel they are attacked. Today we realize being a secular Muslim or a moderate or a radical Muslim is not the right question. It’s about being Muslim.”

When he travels abroad, to New York, Barcelona or Algiers, Mr. Mammeri said, “I’m French; I feel French. But in France, in Marseille every day, you have these same questions, repeated stupidly: what about the burqa, the mosque, terrorism.”

An 11-city study of Islam in Europe by the Open Society Institute, published this month, found that 55 percent of Muslims believe that religious discrimination has increased in the last five years. Muslims are nearly three times as likely to be unemployed as non-Muslims and live more poorly, the study said, but it also found that most Muslims feel a strong connection to their current homelands and want to live in mixed communities.

In Marseille, the study found, 55 percent of Muslims and 68 percent of non-Muslims have a fairly or very strong sense of belonging to their city.

Still, the planned mosque, costing about $33 million, is not welcomed by everyone. Local politicians of the far-right Regional Front have vainly filed lawsuits trying to block construction of what they consider an effort to create an alternative landmark to compete with the city’s cathedrals.

At the Grand Bar Bernabo, a gritty cafe near the site of the new mosque, an older man who refused to give his name said, with a thin smile, “I’m going to bomb it when it opens.” Asked why, he said: “There are a lot of them already, and this will bring more of them, and there will be trouble.”

Jean-Claude, 49, a sanitation worker, said: “People in the area are flipping out, but when it’s done, it’s done. You can say whatever you want, but they’re going to build it.” He only hoped that the minaret — limited to just over 80 feet by local zoning laws — would not be taller than a nearby bell tower.

Gabrielle Martelli said Marseille had a good reputation for tolerance, “but things have been tense here for a long time.”

“There’s a lot of racism here” that goes both ways, she insisted. “When you’ve been insulted and called a ‘sale Française’ ” — a filthy Frenchwoman — “you think: ‘Wait, this is my country.’ ”
944 2009-12-28 MIAMI (Reuters) — An informant in the tax evasion case against the Swiss bank UBS has asked a Florida court to postpone the scheduled Jan. 8 start of his prison term, saying he is ready to cooperate further with the United States government.

The informant, Bradley Birkenfeld, was a former UBS banker who was sentenced in August to three years and four months in prison for helping a billionaire hide assets from American tax authorities. He made the postponement request in a filing this weekend by his lawyer to a federal district court in Florida.

The filing also requested a hearing to reconsider the 40-month sentence imposed on Mr. Birkenfeld on Aug. 21.

Prosecutors described Mr. Birkenfeld as the man most responsible for igniting an investigation into rich Americans’ use of secret Swiss bank accounts to avoid taxes. Partly because of Mr. Birkenfeld’s disclosures, UBS has agreed to disclose to the United States the names of 4,450 wealthy Americans suspected of hiding assets and dodging taxes in secret accounts.

945 2009-12-28 Bemidji State’s first victory in last year’s N.C.A.A. hockey tournament came as a surprise. Its second was a shocker, too.

The 16th-seeded Beavers were the lowest seed to reach the Frozen Four, dispatching Notre Dame and Cornell and becoming the darlings of the tournament before falling in the semifinals.

But Bemidji, a northern Minnesota university of a little more than 5,000 students, is growing accustomed to winning this season. The Beavers are 13-4-1 heading into winter break. The early highlight was a 3-2 win over top-ranked Miami of Ohio, the team that knocked the Beavers out of the tournament in April.

Bemidji Coach Tom Serratore said the tournament wins were a springboard for the program.

“There are not many schools our size that get the opportunity to play in the Frozen Four,” he said. “There was a lot of pride, because we’re basically the little guy.”

Last year’s run helped open doors. After this season, Bemidji State will join the powerhouse Western Collegiate Hockey Association, just in time for the opening of a 4,700-seat arena that is part of a larger events center along the south shore of Lake Bemidji. The Beavers’ new home will be in the heart of Bemidji, a town of about 13,000 where hockey is as much a part of daily life as the lumber mills.
946 2009-12-28 Already the search for yield, rampant during the good times, has returned, and with it the acceptance of innovative products. In December, the Italian telecom group Wind was able to offer the first payment-in-kind note in two years.

Credit spreads have already narrowed substantially; the Markit iTraxx crossover index of mostly high-yield credits has more than halved, to less than 480 basis points from its peak of over 1,100. If bond yields stay low and liquidity stays high, collateralized-debt obligations, heavily subordinated corporate debt and other structured products will be back. Investors probably won’t be as wary as they ought to be.

Leveraged financiers were mostly well behaved in 2009, if only because the credit squeeze took their dangerous toys away. Banks refused them cheap money, prices fell, and when opportunities did emerge, companies could often outbid buyout shops for assets on the block. But the private equity world shouldn’t expect a brand new credit boom in the year ahead.

Acquisitions by buyout firms totaled $130 billion in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data, the lowest since 2002. It could have been worse. Banks were reluctant to force highly indebted and troubled companies to the wall, and the market improved. A few buyouts worth more than $1 billion were announced in the fourth quarter.

The high-yield bond market is the key variable in 2010. If it remains vibrant, leveraged companies could refinance debts, freeing up banks to offer new loans. Banks, in turn, would be more willing to underwrite deals if they were confident that they wouldn’t be left hanging on to the debt for years to come.

Still, nobody should expect a return to the $20 billion-plus buyouts of the boom times. In both the United States and Europe, $5 billion looks to be the most any borrower can raise. And lending terms are tight for leveraged buyout houses, so industrial rivals can often outbid them. That cap could easily shrink if high-yield investors, a jittery bunch, were scared away by a shock from one or two underperforming large deals.

Banks may not jump back into buyouts, either. Rating agencies have scaled back their default forecasts. But with several large deals from the boom teetering, more bank losses are still likely. Regulators, eager for banks to build up their capital strength, aren’t likely to be keen on leveraged loans.

A dull new normal might not please the buyout houses. But for the overall financial system, it doesn’t look so bad. The recent return of some innovation — like issuing bonds to pay dividends to equity holders — even heralds a return of excess. A more vulnerable market would keep the leveraged buyout crew in good standing for another year.

Editors’ Note: October 20, 2010 

 Reuters Breakingviews, a news service whose market analysis articles are published in the business pages of The Times, has identified several past articles in which a writer had a financial interest in the subject or traded in related investments before or after publication. Three of those articles appeared in The Times: on June 4, about BP; and on March 9 and last Dec. 28, involving Lloyds Banking Group. The Times prohibits staff reporters and editors from owning stock or having any other financial interest in a company that they cover, and Reuters said the articles in question also violated its own rules on conflicts of interest. The Times would not have published the articles if editors had known of the conflict.

948 2009-12-29 True to its title, “The Chaser” includes several hot pursuits. Forsaking cars and motorcycles, they involve men running up and down the steep, labyrinthine streets and alleys of the Mangwon neighborhood in western Seoul. When the quarry — a frog-eyed serial killer whose preferred tools are a hammer and chisel — is finally brought to ground, his exhausted pursuers beat him more from irritation than any desire to see justice done.

The sweaty low-tech action and the emphasis on urban topography link the film, the feature debut of the director Na Hong-jin, to modern South Korean classics like Lee Myung-se’s propulsive cop drama “Nowhere to Hide,” and Bong Joon-ho’s river-monster thriller “The Host.” Mr. Na isn’t operating at that high a level, at least not yet. But with “The Chaser” he’s trying to chart a similar course between the poles of art-house pomposity and empty style that characterize so much of Korean moviemaking.

The result may be particularly appealing to American audiences: while many of his compatriots look to France (for cryptic game playing) and Japan (for glossy horror and violence), Mr. Na has his eye on Hollywood. “The Chaser” evokes both film noir, in its conflicted hero and its moody shots of nighttime Seoul, and America’s most influential 21st-century cultural export, the television police procedural, in its straightforward storytelling.

Straightforward by Korean standards, anyway. Mr. Na and his co-screenwriters, Hong Wan-chon and Lee Shin-ho, mostly do without the mind-bending flashbacks, digressions and after-the-fact explanations that can make Korean thrillers seem fatally artificial to Western viewers. But their story does turn on several fairly astounding coincidences, the last abruptly shifting what had been a high-octane crime drama into a tragic key and dissipating much of the tension.

The chaser of the title is Jung-ho (Kim Yoon-suk), a former cop who was caught taking bribes and now runs an escort service. When he notices that his prostitutes are going missing after taking calls from a certain phone number, he sets off to find the caller, assuming that the women are being kidnapped and sold. On a narrow Mangwon street he literally runs into the bad guy, setting off the first of the grueling foot races.
949 2009-12-29 You would think that by now the universe might have run out of attractive people in their 20s with fluid morals and questionable judgment, but no. “The Real World” returns Wednesday on MTV for its 23rd installment. Apparently somebody still watches this show, though who knows why.

The location this time is Washington, or at least the not particularly representative part of Washington embodied by the gentrified Dupont Circle area. That is the site of the house where eight young strangers took up residence last summer for the obligatory drinking, crying, canoodling, arguing and hugging that define this series.

Whether the eight will venture into other, less trendy parts of town remains to be seen, but the makeup of the group doesn’t suggest a desire on the producers’ part to reflect and absorb the character of the city. Fifty-four percent of Washington residents are black; only 12.5 percent of “The Real World” house residents are. That is, one-eighth: Ty, a 22-year-old from Baltimore.

Anyway, the opening episode finds the eight meeting, making snap judgments about one another and sharing the kinds of details you normally share with someone you’ve just met, like how many sexual partners you’ve had.

The assembly line that produces this show’s cast members has, in addition to Ty, this time given us Mike, Callie, Josh, Erika, Emily and Ashley, who need no further introduction because you’ve seen people just like them if you’ve watched any of the previous seasons.

955 2009-12-29 STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — Fire tore through an apartment here early Monday, killing six children and three adults, officials said.

The blaze was reported about 4 a.m., and firefighters worked into the afternoon, shoveling piles of burned debris from the charred unit, on the second floor of a two-story red-brick apartment building in a complex called Academy Crossing.

“I opened my door, and all I saw was flames coming out of the front of the apartment, and the glass just blew and made a sound like a bomb,” said Ramona Doss, who lives across the parking lot in another building. “It’s a tragedy.”

The children killed were 4 months to 6 years old, said the county coroner, Michael Hunt, and the adults were women, one who was 25 and two who were 19. Mr. Hunt said he did not know how the victims were related.

The victims were all in the same apartment. The fire chief, Rodger Mann, said investigators did not yet know what caused the blaze, which he described as the worst in recent memory in Starkville, a city of about 24,000 full-time residents that is home to Mississippi State University, the state’s largest university. Starkville is about 115 miles northeast of Jackson, Miss., and roughly the same distance southeast of Memphis.

957 2009-12-29 The New York state comptroller subpoenaed financial records from the New York Racing Association and is challenging the group’s claim that it may need another bailout to save the Belmont Stakes.

The association, which has held the franchise to run the state’s three thoroughbred tracks for decades, received $105 million from the state and forgiveness of millions more in state debt in 2008. It is refusing to open its books to Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s auditors, saying a recent court ruling limits the comptroller’s authority to examine its finances.

Charles Hayward, the NYRA president, said last week that unless New York lawmakers agreed to have video lottery terminals up and running soon at the Aqueduct track in Queens, NYRA might need another $30 million from the state to save the racing season at Long Island’s Belmont Park, which includes the Belmont.
958 2009-12-29 The N.B.A. has fined Nate Robinson $25,000 for a trade demand made by his agent — an unprecedented action that the players association plans to challenge.

The fine, announced Monday, was levied because of comments made by Aaron Goodwin on Dec. 19. In a series of interviews, including one with The New York Times, Goodwin blasted Coach Mike D’Antoni for benching Robinson and said it was time for the Knicks to trade him.

Robinson has never publicly asked for a trade, and he distanced himself from Goodwin’s remarks at the time.

“I want to be a Knick,” Robinson told reporters a day after Goodwin issued the trade demand. “I want to stay here.”

This is the first time anyone associated with the league could recall a player being fined for comments made by someone else.

“Players are not permitted to make trade requests publicly and are responsible for public statements relating to them made by their representatives,” said Tim Frank, the N.B.A.’s vice president for basketball communications.
959 2009-12-29 But adding more disruption to the security process would be a mistake, he said. “It’s not that we don’t adjust. Business travelers are accustomed to knowing the rules and making do with them,” he said. “Yet right now, you have to wonder about the balance between totally inconveniencing the traveling public versus what is the threat.”

Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said that “security lines lengthened literally overnight” at airports after the stricter measures were put into place. He said that “extra screening will be a hassle, especially for time-sensitive business travelers.”

He also said it was unconscionable that the T.S.A. had not had a permanent director for almost a year. President Obama’s nominee to the post, Erroll G. Southers, has been blocked from confirmation by Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican. Mr. DeMint has asked Mr. Southers, a former F.B.I. agent, to clarify his position on whether T.S.A. workers have a right to be unionized. Mr. Southers is currently the assistant chief for homeland security and intelligence at Los Angeles International Airport and a well-known academic authority on terrorism risk analysis.

On his Web site, aviationplanning.com, the airline consultant Michael Boyd summed up the situation this way: “A clown who was known to be a suspected terrorist is allowed to board a Delta flight at Amsterdam,” and is subdued by passengers and crew when he tries to set off an explosive strapped to his leg. How, Mr. Boyd asked, does ordering an “increase in the pointy-object patrol” rummaging through carry-on bags for screwdrivers, address such an issue?

Obviously, the debate about effective security and antiterrorism intelligence will continue for some time. So let’s step back and look for some advice from experts like Mr. Engmann.

Once the T.S.A. does get a permanent director and a firmer footing, how about asking business travelers to join serious discussions on “how things are really working, and what can be done?” he suggested.

“I go through, what, 150 T.S.A. checkpoints a year? People like us, we notice things,” he said. “If you think about it, we’re also the ones who are most at risk, because we’re flying the most. So we’re not ones who want to make it easy for a terrorist to get on an airplane. On the other hand, we’re the ones who have the most experience at going through the checkpoints and observing.”

Air travel security is a three-legged stool. One leg is the effectiveness of the T.S.A; another is the fortified airplane cockpit doors that make it unlikely that terrorists will ever again commandeer a plane as a guided missile; and the third is vigilant passengers who will fight back, as they did on Friday.

“We’re the first responders, basically,” Mr. Engmann said. “Passengers stopped and flight attendants stopped this guy from doing more damage.”

“In my view, the message going back to Al Qaeda, or whoever, is: ‘Look, you can try this. But passengers are not going to let you get away with it. And you may want to try to make flying like being in prison for us, but we’re just not going to allow you to do that to us either.’ ”
960 2009-12-29 Often the watercolors depict mysterious constructions of a sort that Mr. Wiley also realizes as three-dimensional sculptures. Handwritten captions, composed as if by a hippie cowboy and peppered with puns and clever turns of phrase, ruminate on art, global warming, war and other exigencies.

“I’ve Got It All on the Line” (1970) presents a view through an open studio door to an expansive landscape. To the left is an elaborate, indoor still-life of scores of objects rendered with near-miniaturist exactitude — a pink, wall-mounted telephone under a sheet of numbers; a leather hat and a shoulder bag on a wooden rack; books, tools and more on shelves below. In the front yard to the right, a coat hanger bent into the figure-eight shape of the infinity sign dangles from a telephone wire, while smoke rising from the far horizon hints at some catastrophic happening in the distance.

Along the bottom edge Mr. Wiley wrote, “ ‘I’ve got it all on the line — and the time it takes — to make mistakes — if there is such a thing.’ WIZDUMB — from Lout Sue.” Embracing the particular and the universal and the comic and the cosmic, it is a transporting picture.

A precocious talent in his youth, Mr. Wiley had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art before earning his undergraduate degree from the California School of Fine Arts in 1960. Under the influences of Abstract Expressionism and Bay Area Figuration, he made big, oleaginous, semiabstract paintings.

In the ’60s he cut back on the gestural brushwork and made large, deadpan, cartoonlike pictures. “Shark’s Dream” (1967) expresses frustration with the formalist regime of the day. It depicts an oblong, severely geometric, gray sculpture with a sharklike dorsal protuberance. A stream of pale red liquid like blood spouts from a small hole in its side. Minimalism’s cold colorlessness has rarely been so neatly skewered.

In fall 1967 Mr. Wiley found his way out of a brief period of artist’s block when he picked up watercolor, a medium that was then not taken seriously in the high-art world. In effect he was demanding less of himself, which freed his imagination. A watercolor may be small, but anything can happen in one, and the most surprising things occur in Mr. Wiley’s seemingly modest efforts.

For hard-to-explain reasons, however, he creates his larger works in ways that defeat much of what makes his watercolors so fascinating. In many cases he uses charcoal as the main medium, which looks smudgy and murky on the canvas. Sometimes in addition to the charcoal he trowels on garishly colorful areas of painterly abstraction. His subjects are similar to those of his watercolors, but the pictures tend to be overworked and obscure.

He writes a lot on the canvases, too. On one piece he wrote, “Dude! No one has time to read all this stuff!” Sometimes he is his own best critic.

In recent works Mr. Wiley has been translating images from Hieronymus Bosch, medieval prints and other antique sources. In “Alchemical Lyon Tortured With Abstraction” (2005), a large drawing on canvas resembling an old engraving, a green, priapic lion rears up to bite the sun. It is hard to say what it means, but the esoteric imagery is mystically stirring.

Mr. Wiley’s three-dimensional works also lack the transformational magic of his watercolors. They are loose concatenations of found objects, and their self-consciously homespun humor and portentous symbolism wear thin. “Thank You Hide” (1970-71) features a piece of leather vaguely shaped like a map of the continental United States. Mr. Wiley cut block letters spelling “Thank You” into it and hung it from a shelf bearing bottles and fishing lures; the line of a fishing rod stretches to a pick ax on the floor. As an oblique, mordantly sardonic comment on the tragic history of Indians and the American West, it has poetic urgency. But its material literalism mutes its metaphorical vibe.

In some of Mr. Wiley’s paintings there appears a character named Mr. Unnatural, who was inspired by R. Crumb’s roly-poly savant, Mr. Natural. Mr. Wiley’s avatar is a tall, lanky fellow who wears a dunce cap, a long false nose, Japanese wooden sandals and a bathrobe that reaches his bare knees. He is a holy fool, a wily trickster whose behavior, which seems ridiculous, crazy or dumb to the unenlightened, is really in the service of higher consciousness.

He is an apt personification of Mr. Wiley’s enterprise, which, for all its flaws, remains a beacon of sanity in a crazy, mixed-up, modern world.
961 2009-12-29 But the drugs currently available to enhance bone density are far from perfect. They are expensive, they can have side effects, and they are only about 50 percent effective at preventing fractures.

Before any treatment, possible risks should be weighed against known benefits.

If you have osteoporosis, defined as a T score — the standard measure of bone density — of minus 2.5 or lower, or you have already had an osteoporotic fracture of the forearm, hip, shoulder or spine, the answer is clear: treat. For you, experts say, the benefits of treatment are expected to far outweigh the risks.

But what about the much greater number of women and men whose bones are not as strong as they were at age 30 but who have not yet become osteoporotic — with T scores in the hip or spine of minus 1 to minus 2.5? They are said to have osteopenia, which may or may not eventually lead to osteoporosis. Who among them would most likely benefit from treatment?

To help answer this question, the World Health Organization has devised a controversial tool called FRAX, an online risk calculator to help doctors and patients analyze the likelihood of future osteoporotic fractures and determine whether drug therapy might prevent them. (The calculator is at www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/index.htm.)

The controversy stems largely from the fact that not every possible contributor to fracture risk has been factored into the FRAX formula. In its latest “Clinician’s Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis,” the National Osteoporosis Foundation provides a full list of the lifestyle factors, conditions, diseases and medications that contribute to the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

Especially missing from FRAX are weight-bearing exercise, which has a certain benefit, and a diet that builds bone, which is itself subject to some debate. But the W.H.O. formula includes most of the major players, called clinical risk factors, that affect bone health. And if FRAX is used properly, it can result in far wiser treatment decisions than might otherwise be made.

The formula provides a means of estimating someone’s probability of suffering a hip fracture or major osteoporotic fracture within 10 years, providing numbers that doctors and patients can understand. The risk factors it considers are age, gender, weight and height, a previous fracture, a parent with a hip fracture, current smoking, treatment with corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis and secondary osteoporosis due to a deficiency of vitamin D or excess of parathyroid hormone.

The formula can be applied to men and women across categories of race and ethnicity. In addition, it can be used without knowing a person’s bone density score, although having this test result can enhance the accuracy of the prediction.

“If, using FRAX, someone’s fracture risk is really low, a bone mineral density test probably wouldn’t change the risk very much,” Dr. Susan M. Ott, a bone specialist affiliated with the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an interview. “And if the risk using FRAX is really high, you don’t need the test; you need treatment.

“But if your FRAX risk is in between, getting a bone mineral density test can help you decide whether you need treatment.”

In the journal Osteoporosis International, Dr. Ethel Siris of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center notes that although people with osteopenia have a low fracture risk, many more fall into this midrange of bone density and “total fractures exceed those occurring in persons with osteoporosis.” Dr. Siris says FRAX helps identify “those in the low bone mineral density range who have the highest risk of fracture.”

In Clinical Correlations, an internal medicine blog of New York University, Dr. Judith Brenner demonstrated the power of the FRAX tool. Dr. Brenner calculated the risk for a 60-year-old white woman who is 5 feet and 110 pounds, with no family or personal history of fracture and no history of smoking or using steroids. Using FRAX, the risk of a hip fracture within 10 years for this woman is 1.5 percent.

If the same woman instead weighed 200 pounds, her risk would drop to 0.5 percent (more on the reasons below). But if the 110-pound woman had a parent who suffered a hip fracture, her risk would rise to 1.9 percent. Add smoking, and the risk goes to about 2.9 percent. Add steroids, and the risk rises to 5.9 percent. Add daily consumption of two or more alcoholic drinks, and the risk becomes 9 percent.

Instead of 60, say the woman is 80, slender and with no family or personal history of fractures, smoking or steroid use. Dr. Brenner calculated her risk of fracturing a hip in 10 years as 10 percent and of having any major osteoporotic fracture at 35 percent.

Considering the cost and effectiveness of established treatments, Dr. Brenner wrote, in deciding to treat, “the magic number is a 3 percent risk of hip fracture in 10 years or 20 percent risk of any other major osteoporotic fracture.”

When it comes to bone health, it pays to be heavier. Dr. Ott says that model-thin women are at significantly greater risk of breaking a bone. Extra body weight places more stress on bones, which stimulates them to become stronger. Also, body fat produces estrogen, which helps foster bone strength, especially in postmenopausal women.

But even for slender people, regular weight-bearing exercise is an enormous benefit to bones. “Walk, hike, dance — anything that’s weight-bearing can help protect the hips and spine,” Dr. Ott said.

A bone-healthy diet for women over 50 would provide about 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 1,000 international units of vitamin D daily. For those who take omega-3 fatty acids, Dr. Ott recommended using flaxseed oil rather than fish oil; the latter contains unknown amounts of vitamin A, which in excess can be detrimental to bones.
962 2009-12-29 By giving enterprises a road map for measuring their emissions and pointing out how they compare with their peers, experts say, the voluntary project is persuading companies to change their energy practices well before many governments step in to regulate emissions.

Scientists estimate that industry and energy providers produce nearly 45 percent of the heat-trapping emissions that contribute to global warming. While some governments are convinced that reining in such pollution is crucial to protecting the atmosphere, a binding global pact is not on the immediate horizon, as negotiations in Copenhagen showed this month.

Until broad regulation is at hand, many investors and company executives say, voluntary reporting programs like the Carbon Disclosure Project may be the best way to leverage market forces for change.

They say the project sends a message that a company that moves to curb emissions now is girded for the future and therefore worthy of investment.

“With the regulatory framework changing, how companies handle carbon is a core risk factor,” said Jack Ehnes, chief executive of Calstrs, the California teachers’ pension fund. “Smart companies will take C.D.P. information and realign their strategies.”

Mary Armstrong, Boeing’s vice president for environment, health and safety, traces her company’s energy focus back to 2007, when she first saw the forms that companies fill out for the disclosure project.

“The questions take you through and say, ‘Do you have environmental performance targets?’ We didn’t, but now we do,” she said. The companies’ individual responses are posted at the project’s Web site.

In contrast to the United States, European Union countries already regulate carbon dioxide emissions from their most energy-intensive industries through a cap and trade program, and Japan polices energy consumption itself.

Paul Dickinson, the founder and chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, is quick to acknowledge that his group is no substitute for muscular government regulation. But he argues that the voluntary project offers a frictionless path toward reining in emissions, even in relatively unregulated markets like China’s and India’s. Emissions are expected to soar in those fast-growing economies in coming years as new coal-fired plants go online.

Yet even as the Carbon Disclosure Project has established itself as the standard for emissions measurement methods, it has stirred some skepticism. Critics say that the emissions figures do not have to be verified through external audits, as financial figures from publicly traded companies must be.

And some argue that the project rewards companies that would have cut their carbon dioxide output anyway, and has no influence over polluting companies that refuse to take part.

Nonetheless, 2,500 of the world’s largest companies completed at least part of the project’s questionnaire last year, from the energy conglomerate Gazprom in Russia to Huaxin Cement in China.

In the United States, where almost only the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index were solicited by the disclosure project, some 330 filled out forms this year. Some companies do not answer all of the questions. But the most detailed reports specify not only how much energy a company consumes, and how, but also ticks off ways in which it might be vulnerable to climate change — flooded stores, for example.

Industry is a broad and varied category, of course, covering everything from cement and chemical makers, which emit an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, to data-driven businesses like financial services, which emit little by comparison.

The disclosure project has response rates of at least 60 percent for most industry sectors in the United States. But it has even higher rates for utilities, which are highly regulated, and materials companies, which include cement and chemical makers. It has received responses from energy titans like Chevron and chemical companies like DuPont.

To drum up more and better reporting, the project has enlisted major investors like Calstrs, the nation’s second-largest pension program, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to co-sign letters from the project encouraging companies to take part.

Mr. Dickinson said the project writes letters on behalf of 475 investor groups representing $55 trillion in funds worldwide.

Some American companies have argued that reporting is cumbersome and could allow competitors to learn too much about their manufacturing processes. But proponents counter that the monitoring could give some of them a competitive advantage as early adopters.

In September, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it could require the nation’s biggest power plants and industrial operations to report greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2011. The United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have firmly opposed such regulation, saying that it would be legally and technically burdensome, drive up fuel costs by promoting renewable sources and send job overseas.

But nations that have already pressed ahead with regulations are prodding the United States to match their efforts. The European Union has been monitoring and limiting carbon dioxide emissions from its most energy-intensive sectors since 2005 through a cap and trade program.

Since 2003 Japan has required companies of any size to report energy consumption to the government and what they are doing to reduce use. Mr. Dickinson argues that disclosure could prove a means of currying investor favor in international markets as the global awareness of industry’s role in climate change deepens.

“I have real confidence that the corporations of the world are going to outperform government in terms of dealing with climate change,” he said. “In fact, they are already.”

His vision for carbon transparency dates back to 1997, when he entered a master’s program on responsible business practices at the University of Bath School of Management taught by Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop.

After graduating, he solicited philanthropists, including Ted Turner, and went about developing reliable ways to measure output. Then he reached out to large investors to co-sign letters demanding that companies fill out the project’s forms. Until 2002, the forms spoke only of “the perception” of climate change because global warming was still “too controversial,” he said.

Some analysts now laud the program as an innovative way of encouraging investors to factor industry emissions into assessments of corporate performance.

Abyd Karmali, global head of carbon markets for Bank of America, likens the disclosure project to the advent of general accounting principles, which enable investors to compare financial performance and move dollars accordingly.

“It is very difficult to translate carbon-related risk into standardized disclosure, so it is a fantastic contribution,” he said.

But others have their doubts. “There is disclosure, and then so what?” said Hewson Baltzell, the co-founder of Innovest, a financial research firm that gathered figures for the disclosure project the first several years. “They’ve dipped their toe in the water on asking companies about performance, but not very far.”

Mr. Dickinson counters that the project has added evaluations that rate companies by concrete steps taken to cut their emissions. It now also asks companies to calculate emissions of their suppliers, in the hope of leveraging the power that a giant like Wal-Mart might have over those that are otherwise unwilling to report.

Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist for Microsoft, which is helping the project make its data more accessible to the public, says the impact of the reports is growing.

“With each year we are able to compare performance on greenhouse gas information with new levels of granularity,” he said. “Now we just have to hope that more people read it and care.”
963 2009-12-29 Kenya has plans to test four million people in their homes next year for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and the advocacy group Human Rights Watch recently sent the Kenyan government a letter asking that it ensure that all those tested  particularly children and teenagers  have their rights protected during the process.

About 150,000 children are believed to be infected in Kenya, which has a widespread epidemic.

Offering tests and counseling at home is seen as crucial because many people cannot be persuaded to go to a clinic for testing for fear of being seen there.

But testing children at home can create serious family problems. The rights group asked that outreach workers obtain the consent of older children rather than relying on demands from parents or other relatives, especially if the child is pregnant or already a parent, and also that they stay nearby when results are given

“In the past,” the group said, “children have been kicked out of their home, exploited or physically ill-treated by their relatives when their status became known.”

A report about Kenya’s epidemic, which the organization issued last year, painted a grim picture. Orphans are often treated badly or fed little by resentful relatives who take them in.

Some parents refuse to give children antiretroviral pills, even when they are in the home, because they can cause nausea, pain or hunger, while food is scarce and expensive.
964 2009-12-29 His doctor there, Larisa Litvinova, told the commission that by the day before his death he was vomiting every three hours, his stomach was swollen and “it was necessary to push for an examination — I thought he had a chronic disease.”

The inquiry, the commission wrote, “testifies either to negligence in the performance of their duties, or to an intentional concealment of the reason for refusing the examination.”

“This interference by investigators is a serious problem,” said Valery V. Borshchev, the commission’s president, at a news conference on Monday. “It’s a serious violation, and it needs to be stopped.”

Though a doctor diagnosed pancreatitis and gall bladder disease and ordered surgery for Mr. Magnitsky in June, treatment was abruptly cut off the following month, when Mr. Magnitsky was transferred to Butyrskaya Prison, which has limited medical facilities.

The chief of the detention center, Ivan P. Prokopenko, told the commission that five prisoners had been transferred because prison officials had been planning a renovation. Five months later, the commission noted, the renovation had not taken place. Mr. Prokopenko said he had no reservations about the transfer.

“I did not consider Magnitsky sick,” he told the commission. “Prisoners often try to pass themselves off as sick, in order to get better conditions. We are all sick.”

By last month, Mr. Magnitsky’s complaints had become urgent. At 11 a.m. on Nov. 16, Dr. Litvinova ordered him moved to a better-equipped medical unit. Six hours later, an ambulance arrived to take him.

He arrived there at 6:30 p.m., but when the unit’s surgeon looked in on him half an hour later, she said Mr. Magnitsky was agitated, trying to hide behind a bag and saying people were trying to kill him, the report says. She ordered a psychiatric team to come to the unit, prescribed a painkiller, and left him there. At 9:20 p.m., a staff member reported that Mr. Magnitsky was lying on the floor of his cell. He was declared dead at 9:50.

Zoya Svetova, one of the commission’s investigators, said the inquiry had challenged her assumptions. “I had the impression that Magnitsky died because of doctors’ negligence, because they thought he had invented his illness,” she said. “Now I have the frightening feeling that it was not negligence but that it was, to some extent, as terrible as it is to say, a premeditated murder.”
965 2009-12-29 LONDON — The British government said Monday that it rejected an application by the Nigerian man accused in the failed Detroit airliner bombing plot for a renewed student visa in May, and that he was placed on an official watch list to prevent him from re-entering Britain.

In a BBC radio interview, Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not believe that the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had acted alone in a plot investigators say could have brought down a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit with more than 280 people aboard on Christmas Day.

Mr. Johnson gave no reason for suggesting that Mr. Abdulmutallab might have had accomplices. But he noted that Scotland Yard and Britain’s security services were investigating whether the suspect’s Islamic beliefs were radicalized while he was a mechanical engineering student from 2005 to 2008 at University College London, one of Britain’s elite academic institutions.

Mr. Johnson said Mr. Abdulmutallab’s application to renew his student visa was rejected in May after officials had determined that the academic course he gave as his reason for returning to Britain was fake. The secretary said the suspect was then placed on the watch list, a procedure that would normally involve informing American authorities of the action Britain had taken.

But Mr. Johnson was vague about whether officials in the United States had officially been informed of the action, although he said he doubted that there had been a “hiccup” in the process.
966 2009-12-29 A day after violent protests rocked cities across , the authorities arrested at least a dozen opposition figures on Monday, including former Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi, the human rights activist Emad Baghi and three top aides to the former presidential candidate , Iranian news sites reported.

All told, more than 1,500 people have been arrested nationwide since Sunday, including 1,110 in Tehran and 400 in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, the pro-opposition Jaras Web site reported.

In , where he is on vacation, condemned the violence against protesters and called for the release of those “unjustly detained.”

“For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights,” Mr. Obama told reporters. “Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days.”

He added that the protests in Iran had nothing to do with the or other foreign countries. “It’s about the Iranian people, and their aspirations for justice, and a better life for themselves,” he said. “And the decision of Iran’s leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making those aspirations go away.”

The streets of Tehran were largely quiet on Monday, as citizens absorbed the shock of the previous day’s violence. Thirteen people were reported to have been killed and many more wounded in street battles in cities across the country between security forces and protesters, who fought back more fiercely than ever before. The government said Monday that eight people had been killed in Tehran, and opposition Web sites catalogued five deaths in other cities.
967 2009-12-29 BANGKOK — The first in a series of trials of dissidents in Vietnam concluded Monday when a court convicted a former army officer of subversion for pro-democracy activities and sentenced him to five and a half years in prison.

The conviction of the former officer, Tran Anh Kim, 60, comes as the government is tightening controls on dissent in advance of a Communist Party congress in early 2011.

Mr. Kim is one of five activists who were arrested in June and, at first, faced the less serious charge of spreading antigovernment propaganda. But this month, Mr. Kim and at least two others were charged with the capital crime of subversion. Prosecutors asked for a lighter sentence in view of the military background of Mr. Kim, a wounded veteran.

Sentences in political cases are generally determined in advance, and the trial, held in Thai Binh Province, in northeastern Vietnam, took just four hours. The other four campaigners are scheduled to go to trial next month. The most prominent among them is Le Cong Dinh, 41, an American-educated lawyer who has defended human rights campaigners and has called for multiparty democracy.

The others are Nguyen Tien Trung, who recently studied engineering in Paris; Tran Huynh Duy Thuc; and Le Thang Long. They are among dozens of dissidents and bloggers who have been arrested in recent months as the government tries to set the boundaries of public speech before the party congress, which is held every five years, diplomats and political analysts said.

Along the bottom edge Mr. Wiley wrote, “ ‘I’ve got it all on the line — and the time it takes — to make mistakes — if there is such a thing.’ WIZDUMB — from Lout Sue.” Embracing the particular and the universal and the comic and the cosmic, it is a transporting picture.

A precocious talent in his youth, Mr. Wiley had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art before earning his undergraduate degree from the California School of Fine Arts in 1960. Under the influences of Abstract Expressionism and Bay Area Figuration, he made big, oleaginous, semiabstract paintings.

In the ’60s he cut back on the gestural brushwork and made large, deadpan, cartoonlike pictures. “Shark’s Dream” (1967) expresses frustration with the formalist regime of the day. It depicts an oblong, severely geometric, gray sculpture with a sharklike dorsal protuberance. A stream of pale red liquid like blood spouts from a small hole in its side. Minimalism’s cold colorlessness has rarely been so neatly skewered.

In fall 1967 Mr. Wiley found his way out of a brief period of artist’s block when he picked up watercolor, a medium that was then not taken seriously in the high-art world. In effect he was demanding less of himself, which freed his imagination. A watercolor may be small, but anything can happen in one, and the most surprising things occur in Mr. Wiley’s seemingly modest efforts.

For hard-to-explain reasons, however, he creates his larger works in ways that defeat much of what makes his watercolors so fascinating. In many cases he uses charcoal as the main medium, which looks smudgy and murky on the canvas. Sometimes in addition to the charcoal he trowels on garishly colorful areas of painterly abstraction. His subjects are similar to those of his watercolors, but the pictures tend to be overworked and obscure.

He writes a lot on the canvases, too. On one piece he wrote, “Dude! No one has time to read all this stuff!” Sometimes he is his own best critic.

In recent works Mr. Wiley has been translating images from Hieronymus Bosch, medieval prints and other antique sources. In “Alchemical Lyon Tortured With Abstraction” (2005), a large drawing on canvas resembling an old engraving, a green, priapic lion rears up to bite the sun. It is hard to say what it means, but the esoteric imagery is mystically stirring.

Mr. Wiley’s three-dimensional works also lack the transformational magic of his watercolors. They are loose concatenations of found objects, and their self-consciously homespun humor and portentous symbolism wear thin. “Thank You Hide” (1970-71) features a piece of leather vaguely shaped like a map of the continental United States. Mr. Wiley cut block letters spelling “Thank You” into it and hung it from a shelf bearing bottles and fishing lures; the line of a fishing rod stretches to a pick ax on the floor. As an oblique, mordantly sardonic comment on the tragic history of Indians and the American West, it has poetic urgency. But its material literalism mutes its metaphorical vibe.

In some of Mr. Wiley’s paintings there appears a character named Mr. Unnatural, who was inspired by R. Crumb’s roly-poly savant, Mr. Natural. Mr. Wiley’s avatar is a tall, lanky fellow who wears a dunce cap, a long false nose, Japanese wooden sandals and a bathrobe that reaches his bare knees. He is a holy fool, a wily trickster whose behavior, which seems ridiculous, crazy or dumb to the unenlightened, is really in the service of higher consciousness.

He is an apt personification of Mr. Wiley’s enterprise, which, for all its flaws, remains a beacon of sanity in a crazy, mixed-up, modern world.
974 2009-12-29 His doctor there, Larisa Litvinova, told the commission that by the day before his death he was vomiting every three hours, his stomach was swollen and “it was necessary to push for an examination — I thought he had a chronic disease.”

The inquiry, the commission wrote, “testifies either to negligence in the performance of their duties, or to an intentional concealment of the reason for refusing the examination.”

“This interference by investigators is a serious problem,” said Valery V. Borshchev, the commission’s president, at a news conference on Monday. “It’s a serious violation, and it needs to be stopped.”

Though a doctor diagnosed pancreatitis and gall bladder disease and ordered surgery for Mr. Magnitsky in June, treatment was abruptly cut off the following month, when Mr. Magnitsky was transferred to Butyrskaya Prison, which has limited medical facilities.

The chief of the detention center, Ivan P. Prokopenko, told the commission that five prisoners had been transferred because prison officials had been planning a renovation. Five months later, the commission noted, the renovation had not taken place. Mr. Prokopenko said he had no reservations about the transfer.

“I did not consider Magnitsky sick,” he told the commission. “Prisoners often try to pass themselves off as sick, in order to get better conditions. We are all sick.”

By last month, Mr. Magnitsky’s complaints had become urgent. At 11 a.m. on Nov. 16, Dr. Litvinova ordered him moved to a better-equipped medical unit. Six hours later, an ambulance arrived to take him.

He arrived there at 6:30 p.m., but when the unit’s surgeon looked in on him half an hour later, she said Mr. Magnitsky was agitated, trying to hide behind a bag and saying people were trying to kill him, the report says. She ordered a psychiatric team to come to the unit, prescribed a painkiller, and left him there. At 9:20 p.m., a staff member reported that Mr. Magnitsky was lying on the floor of his cell. He was declared dead at 9:50.

Zoya Svetova, one of the commission’s investigators, said the inquiry had challenged her assumptions. “I had the impression that Magnitsky died because of doctors’ negligence, because they thought he had invented his illness,” she said. “Now I have the frightening feeling that it was not negligence but that it was, to some extent, as terrible as it is to say, a premeditated murder.”

979 2009-12-30 Eugene E. van Tamelen, a chemist who turned to nature for inspiration in synthesizing molecules, died Dec. 12 at his home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. He was 84.

The cause was cancer, said Stanford University, where Dr. van Tamelen had been a professor of chemistry.

“He was a very original, big-picture kind of thinker,” said Eric Jacobsen, a professor of chemistry at Harvard. “He was an organic chemist, but he really asked big questions that transcended the specific discipline of organic chemistry.”

In recent years, copying nature has become a trendy approach, one that many scientists have taken in their research. Dr. van Tamelen had taken that path a half-century ago.

“He was one of the first people to take what we call a biomimetic approach to synthesis,” Dr. Jacobson said.
980 2009-12-30 Eight soldiers detained in an investigation into a possible antigovernment conspiracy were released without charge on Tuesday, the state-run Anatolian News Agency reported. The soldiers were detained for questioning on Saturday, fueling speculation about strains between the secularist military and governing Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P. The prosecutor released five of the soldiers and asked a court to remand the three others in custody, the agency reported. The court later ordered the remaining three soldiers released.

At Cendrillon, Mr. Dorotan used the Philippines as a point of reference for his cooking — “Malay by nature, Chinese and Hispanic by curious nurture — and added to it European flavors.” At Purple Yam, the menu has those old favorites but also looks widely across Asia for inspiration, “most notably toward Korea, the cuisine of which provides both kimchi and a number of flavored sojus, a mean bibimbap and a spicy tofu soup.” Also on the menu: pig — almost every part of it — “sublime” chicken adobo, a faintly ridiculous wild-boar pizza, and halo halo, the Philippines’ answer to an ice-cream sundae. Test your appetite for adventure and go.
983 2009-12-30 The prospect of earning money for songs that are now being illegally downloaded is, of course, what drew labels to the start-up.

Advertisers, meanwhile, like the assurance — take that, Tivo — that ads are being viewed.

For each download users will select from about a dozen ads to view, and if, say, they choose Coca-Cola, then the company pays for that song in what the site calls a microsponsorship.

“If people opt in to see your ad, then they’re more receptive to your message,” said Julie Coulton, a senior vice president at Mullen, Boston, the advertising agency representing Zappos. “You have a much more qualified, leaning-forward viewer, a much more engaged consumer.”

With the popularity of online music services like iTunes and Pandora, which principally streams music free to computers or smartphones and is supported by banner ads, many companies have sought ways to profit from digital music.

But until now they have mostly been tilting at windmills. SpiralFrog, which also offered a free music download service supported by banner ads, failed spectacularly, shutting down in March after losing $26 million on revenue of just $1.2 million in 2008, according to income statements acquired by CNET News.

“The online music industry remains as risky as walking through a minefield punch-drunk,” Om Malik, the founder of the technology site GigaOM, wrote recently.

But Steve Yanovsky, founder of Brand Alchemy, a digital media and music branding agency, said that unlike SpiralFrog, whose songs were protected by digital rights restrictions, played only on PCs and required downloading software, FreeAllMusic offers shareable downloads that will work on Apple devices as well as PCs and requires no software.

And because the site will let brands align themselves with music lovers, Mr. Yanovsky sees parallels with how Mountain Dew endears itself to action sports fans through the sponsoring of Dew Tour competitions.

“Brands have got to get out of the way and be facilitators,” Mr. Yanovsky said.

To promote itself, along with the record labels and advertisers, the site plans to recruit users themselves. After downloading a song, users will be asked if they wish to post the details to their Facebook profiles and Twitter streams, and if FreeAllMedia may feature their song and user name in banner ads on other Web sites, as in, “Andy N just downloaded ‘I Wanna Be Sedated’ by the Ramones courtesy of Zappos.com.”

Some bristle at that prospect, like Paul Bonanos, who, also posting on GigaOM, wrote, “I don’t think anyone will be too enthusiastic about his screen name appearing in banner ads all over the Web.”

But Mr. Nailling of FreeAllMusic emphasized that such ads would appear only with users’ approval.

“We think some portion of our users — not all — will like the fact that they’re being influencers,” Mr. Nailling said. “We think that might be compelling to users.”

It’s certainly compelling to advertisers, whose reach will extend to social networks like Facebook, where, if friends opt to download the same song, they must first watch the same ad.

The service is tinkering with how many downloads it will permit, and initially is allowing 20 monthly, and no more than five a session.

Within six months, FreeAllMusic aims to be smartphone compatible, meaning users could download music (and view compulsory ads) on iPhones and other devices.

Jim Lesser, executive creative director at BBDO West, based in San Francisco, has yet to sign any of his clients to the site, but likes the prospect of consumers in one sitting viewing as many as five spots, which advertisers could present in a specific order.

“You could tell a story in a serial fashion, and you’d have a good shot of them viewing the whole campaign,” Mr. Lesser said.

It also could be a litmus test.

“It’s a great thing for advertisers because, at the very least, it will give them a sense of how relevant they are to consumers,” he said. “It puts the pressure on to be fun and exciting to watch, or else people aren’t going to watch them — but in return they’ll get eyeballs glued to the message.”
984 2009-12-30 Joel and Ethan Coen’s 1998 movie, “The Big Lebowski,” which stars Jeff Bridges as a beatific, pot-smoking, bowling-obsessed slacker known as the Dude, snuck up on the English-speaking world during the ’00s: it became, stealthily, the decade’s most venerated cult film. It’s got that elusive and addictive quality that a great midnight movie has to have: it blissfully widens and expands in your mind upon repeat viewings.

“The Big Lebowski” has spawned its own shaggy, fervid world: drinking games, Halloween costumes, bumper stickers (“This aggression will not stand, man”) and a drunken annual festival that took root in Louisville, Ky., and has spread to other cities. The movie is also the subject of an expanding shelf of books, including “The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers” and the forthcoming “The Tao of the Dude.”

Where cult films go, academics will follow. New in bookstores, and already in its second printing, is “The Year’s Work in Lebowski Studies,” an essay collection edited by Edward P. Comentale and Aaron Jaffe (Indiana University Press, $24.95). The book is, like the Dude himself, a little rough around the edges. But it’s worth an end-of-the-year holiday pop-in. Ideally you’d read it with a White Russian  the Dude’s cocktail of choice  in hand.

More than a few of this book’s essay titles will make you groan and laugh out loud at the same time (“ ‘The Big Lebowski’ and Paul de Man: Historicizing Irony and Ironizing Historicism”). But just as often, the writing here is a bit like the film: amiable, laid-back and possessed of a wobbly Zen-acuity.

In one essay Fred Ashe  he is an associate professor of English at Birmingham-Southern College  profitably compares the Dude to Rip van Winkle, for both his “friendly charisma” and what Washington Irving described as Rip’s “insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor.” Both men, Mr. Ashe notes, expose “the sickness of a straight society premised on the Puritan work ethic.”

In another, “On the White Russian,” Craig N. Owens  he teaches literature and writing at Drake University in Des Moines  divides the world into two factions: those who float the cream on their White Russians (“the floaters”) and those who mix it in (“the homogenizers”). He praises the Dude’s “middle way,” avoiding the hassle of “shaking and straining.”

At times Mr. Owens sounds as if he’s been hitting the minibar himself. He writes about how Leon Trotsky is “doubly implicated” in the White Russian, first because he helped defeat the anti-Communist White Russian army during the Russian civil war, and second because he later fled to Mexico, “Kahlúa’s country of origin.” Mr. Owens suggests that the Dude has a kind of “Trotskian positionality.”

Most of the essays in “The Year’s Work in Lebowski Studies” began as papers presented at the 2006 Lebowski Fest in Louisville. Working at an unhurried, Dude-like crawl, it took the editors three years to wrap these papers up and usher them into print.

“When we first put out a call for papers, we received about 200 proposals,” said Mr. Comentale, an associate professor of English at Indiana University, Bloomington, whose previous books include “Modernism, Cultural Production and the British Avant-Garde” and “T. E. Hulme and the Question of Modernism.”

When putting the book together, Mr. Comentale said, he and his co-editor “immediately cut out all the papers celebrating the Dude as a hippie hero in a postmodern landscape.” That’s a sober choice. Admirers of the Dude are already dangerously close to becoming Internet-age versions of Parrotheads, the weekend-warrior Jimmy Buffett fans who tip back margaritas  and embarrass their children  while wearing flip-flops, board shorts, Hawaiian shirts and coconut bras.

“Trying to impress your academic colleagues and also make a dent in the popular market, that’s a fine line to walk,” Mr. Comentale added. “We wanted these essays to press the connection between the goofy and the profound.”

Reading “The Year’s Work in Lebowski Studies,” it’s hard not to recall some of the profound and not-so-goofy things the novelist Umberto Eco had to say about cult movies in his 1984 essay “ ‘Casablanca’: Cult Movies and Intertextual Collage.”

“What are the requirements for transforming a book or movie into a cult object?” Mr. Eco asked. “The work must be loved, obviously, but this is not enough. It must provide a completely furnished world so that its fans can quote characters and episodes as if they were aspects of the fan’s private sectarian world, a world about which one can make up quizzes and play trivia games so that the adepts of the sect recognize through each other a shared expertise.”
985 2009-12-30 NEW DELHI  This was a lost decade for the American stock market. But for much of developing world, it was the Roaring ’00s  a period of soaring markets and breakneck investment that left even some bulls wondering if the good times can last.

While the broad American market lost about a fifth of its value in the last 10 years, emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, China and India powered ahead with gains in the double or even triple digits.

The numbers are staggering. On Ukraine’s PFTS Stock Exchange  a Wild East of investing that did not even exist until 1997  shares soared more than 1,350 percent over the last decade. In Peru, stocks jumped more than 660 percent. Here in India, the Sensex index leaped more than 240 percent.

To believers, those heady gains underscore profound shifts taking place in the global economy, where investment dollars, euros and yen whiz across borders and time zones with the stroke of a computer key. As many Americans wait for an economic recovery, money is pouring into the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, as well as into oil-rich Russia and the former Soviet bloc.

“What we’re living through now is something of epic proportions,” said Allan Conway, the head of emerging markets equities at Schroders, the big money management company in London. He likened the economic rise of nations like Brazil, Russia, India and China  the so-called BRIC countries  to that of postwar Japan.

Amid all this euphoria, even some longtime bulls wonder if investors are getting a bit carried away. Emerging markets have a history of giddy booms and crushing busts dating back to the 19th century. They collapsed spectacularly in 1997, as a chain reaction of currency devaluations, bankruptcies and recessions rocked East Asia. In 1998, the Russian market plunged more than 80 percent after the country defaulted on its debts.

More recently, emerging markets tanked with the rest of the world in 2008, after shellshocked money managers took cash from anywhere that seemed risky. But they were a bright spot in 2009  the MSCI Emerging Markets index increased 73 percent in 2009, compared with a 25 percent jump in the S.& P. 500 index.

Despite 2009’s gains, few predict a major setback today. Since the 1998 debacle, some developing countries have cleaned up their acts, balancing their budgets and improving their trade balances. As their economies grow, domestic investors have become big supporters of these countries’ stock markets. With interest rates low around the world, companies based in emerging markets, like their counterparts in the developed world, enjoy access to cheap money. High commodities prices have buoyed stock and bond markets in nations that are big exporters of commodities.

But the recent travails of Dubai, where a debt-driven bubble economy is now bursting, provide a powerful reminder that in up-and-coming economies, what goes up can come down  and fast. That these markets have gained so much, so quickly  with some white-knuckled drops along the way  gives some investment professionals pause.

Mark Mobius, one of the deans of emerging market investing, said that while developing markets still have room to run, the first half of 2010 could be bumpy.

“We continue to see upside, but with substantial corrections along the way, which could be as much as 20 percent,” said Mr. Mobius, the executive chairman of Franklin Templeton Investments, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.

Some market specialists worry that asset bubbles akin to the one that inflated and burst in the American housing market might be growing in places like China and Hong Kong. Others fret over the risks posed by volatile commodities prices, as well as over the inevitable end of this period of ultralow interest rates.

Leon Goldfeld, the chief investment officer for HSBC Global Asset Management in Hong Kong, told reporters this month that HSBC had cut its exposure to Asian equities, anticipating a 10 percent to 15 percent decline in early 2010. After that, Mr. Goldfeld said, Asian stocks would represent a “good buying opportunity.”

As long-term investments go, emerging markets seem to have a lot going for them. On average, developing countries have less sovereign, corporate and household debt than developed countries. Their economies are also growing faster than industrialized ones. Merrill Lynch predicts that emerging market economies will grow 6.3 percent next year, while the global economy expands by 4.4 percent.

Emerging markets are eclipsing their developed peers in other ways as well. Imports to the BRIC nations are likely to surpass imports to the United States for the first time ever in 2009, according to Morgan Stanley.

For the moment, the developing world is the engine of global growth. Emerging markets accounted for virtually all of the year’s growth in global output, because developed economies shrank or were flat. Even if developed countries recover completely in 2010, emerging economies will account for 70 to 75 percent of the growth in global output “for the foreseeable future,” said Mr. Conway of Schroders.

Developing nations are also assuming a bigger role in the world economy. Morgan Stanley predicts that developing countries, including those in the Middle East, will account for 36 percent of total global gross domestic product in 2010, up from 21 percent in 1999.

All of this is a big lure to investors. Funds focused on equities in emerging markets attracted a record $75.4 billion this year, far surpassing their previous high of $54 billion in 2007, according to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows.

Even after that influx, emerging markets still account for only a small fraction of investment portfolios in United States and Europe, the world’s money management centers. Less than 3 percent of assets managed by United States fund managers are invested in emerging markets. That number could double in the next five years, some investment experts say.

Even normally conservative investors might be tempted to jump into emerging markets, given the sluggish outlook in the United States and Europe. After a dismal decade for the American stock market, the developing countries might seem attractive.

“Investors are starting to look at this asset class and realize that it is a pretty safe place,” said Kevin Daly, who manages $1.7 billion in emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Despite their volatile history, emerging markets strike some money managers as relatively secure places to invest. Of course, such hopes have been dashed before.
986 2009-12-30 The figures released Tuesday showed that the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index, a widely watched measure of housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, rose 0.4 percent in October from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.

It was the fifth consecutive month that prices were up, but the rate of increase has dropped sharply from the impressive gains of the summer. Prices in nine of the 20 cities were flat or down.

Some analysts see little cause for alarm. Dan Greenhaus of Miller Tabak said that if prices fell “a bit further” it would sop up some of the excess inventory still weighing on the market.

But others said that the Case-Shiller index showed an increase only because each report is an average of the preceding three months, meaning the strong August market was still a component of the October report. Another factor supporting the index is the seasonal adjustments, which tend to hide any weakness in the cooler months as the pace of home-buying slows.

On an unadjusted basis, the index was flat. A different housing price index, compiled by the research firm LoanPerformance, fell 0.7 percent in October.

Mr. Case, who chided himself for his optimism over the summer, said he now believed “the probability is very high of a serious double dip like 1982.”

The federal government has mounted an extensive and expensive effort to repair housing. While these actions undoubtedly staved off a total collapse, they are showing signs of fatigue.

The tax credit for first-time buyers has been extended until next spring, but the urgency that buyers showed this summer, when they believed the credit was about to end, has drained away. The Federal Reserve has intervened in the market to push 30-year mortgage rates to the lowest level in decades, but says that program will end by March 31. Rates have already crept back above 5 percent.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants, are tightening policies for loans in their portfolios. Lenders who sell their mortgages to Fannie and Freddie are becoming more skittish about extending credit.

The Federal Housing Administration, which has become an important part of the entry-level housing market, is expected to tighten its standards in the next few weeks. That would further crimp the pool of eligible buyers.

Faramarz Moeen-Ziai of Bank of Commerce Mortgage in San Ramon, Calif., said many of his clients were struggling to complete deals. “All this is adding to the downward pressure on prices,” he said.

Falling prices are in theory good for buyers. Some housing commentators say prices need to fall much further before houses will be truly affordable. But the drop over the last three years, however necessary, has caused tremendous damage to wallets and to the lubricant of commerce, confidence in the future.

Falling prices have put as many as a quarter of mortgage holders under water, where the loan balance is greater than the amount the home would fetch. If they lose their jobs, they have little choice but to opt for foreclosure. In a vicious circle, every new foreclosure puts more pressure on the housing market.

Neree Dastous, a 39-year-old firefighter in a San Francisco suburb, would like to move from his condominium into a three-bedroom house. But the condo is under water, so he cannot sell. Keeping it as a rental pushes his debt-to-income ratio above the new Fannie Mae guidelines. Interest rates are not helping, either.

“Anything I can afford, I wouldn’t want my kids to live in,” Mr. Dastous said. “I need prices to come down, but if they do the value of my condo goes down, too. It’s very complicated.”

Mr. Case, the Wellesley economist, said he was heartened by the minimal pace of housing starts by builders and the exuberant sales volume of existing houses. These two forces should ultimately clear the backlog in the market and prop up prices.

Yet for now, prices in many cities are weakening. “There’s no historical data for falling house prices” on such a scale, he said. “We don’t know how this ends.”

While the Case-Shiller index has managed gains for the last several months, it is still down 7.3 percent from October 2008 and is off 29.5 percent from its peak. Some analysts predict prices will fall as much as an additional 10 percent. That could swiftly undermine consumers’ frail confidence.

The Conference Board reported Tuesday that the consumer confidence index increased in December to 52.9 from a revised 50.6 in November. In February, when talk of another Depression was rife, the index was at 25.3.

“Part of the reason people are turning more optimistic is a perception that the real estate market has turned,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. “If that proves to be false, and we think it will be, it is going to come as a surprise to many.”

Mr. Dastous, the foiled buyer, is already deeply disappointed. He is exploring foreclosures and fixer-uppers, but has no confidence he and his family will be able to move any time soon.

996 2009-12-31 Many companies sticking with tradition have been more miserly. Since 1936, companies have paid an average of 53 percent of their earnings in dividends. Over the last decade, they have offered 46 percent.

After this meager decade, a steady flow of cash in the hand looks a lot better than potential capital gains in the bush. In financial theory, assuming equalized tax rates, the two have identical value. In practice, though, a relatively steady dividend payout reduces investment risk and keeps corporate executives from taking too many big bets on risky investments and acquisitions.

It’s time for dividends to come back into fashion.

Why bother? That’s the question more underwater Americans are asking themselves about their mortgages. Trapped in the abyss of negative equity, more will decide to quit paying. That would be a rational response.

About a quarter of all mortgages in the United States are on houses that are worth less than the unpaid balance of the loan, according to the real estate consultant First American CoreLogic. About half of that group, 5.3 million borrowers, are 20 percent or more underwater. For 2.2 million, the property is worth less than half the mortgage balance.

Those folks are called homeowners, but home borrowers would be more accurate. All they own is an obligation to whatever entity services their mortgage. They’re essentially renters paying more than market prices for their habitat.

That ownership tag is often felt to be important. And Americans trained to believe that a mortgage is a moral obligation fear punishment or a guilty conscience if they walk away.

But foreclosure is hardly the mark of Cain, especially in states like California and Arizona where lenders have no practical recourse to pursue a borrower’s other assets.

As more homeowners underwater realize there’s no hope to regain their equity, more will reasonably seek to cut their losses. The reduction of liabilities brings immediate debt relief and often a lower cash outlay — on rent — for comparable housing. The financial shot in the arm should outweigh the stigma of foreclosure.

Financial self-interest is likely to be contagious. A study by three economists suggests that when a few borrowers in a neighborhood just say no, others are likely to do the same.

Lenders do what they can to keep economic rationality from spreading. They try to extend and pretend with lower interest rates, longer terms, and the pretense that eventually the borrower will make good. They will do anything to avoid the hit to capital that comes from a write-down of the principal.

Until now, borrower guilt has helped protect bank balance sheets. That is likely to change and usher in a new, painful chapter of the financial crisis.
997 2009-12-31 The attempted jetliner bombing has laid bare a welter of security shortcomings. One could be easily fixed if Senator Jim DeMint would drop his wrongheaded hold and allow the Senate to confirm a new chief for the Transportation Security Administration.

The Obama administration failed to offer a nominee until September, pleading the time was needed to find the right executive for the important post. Their belated choice, Erroll Southers, is a former F.B.I. agent who earned high marks when he served as chief of homeland security for California. He was easily approved by two Senate committees and heading for bipartisan confirmation — until the South Carolina Republican obstructed.

What’s the problem? Mr. DeMint says he won’t let the nomination go forward until he’s assured that a legal ban on T.S.A. workers unionizing will remain in place. Even after last week’s near-disaster over the Detroit airport, Senator DeMint clung to his union-bashing and knee-jerk warnings about the risks of security workers being allowed to collectively bargain.

He absurdly argued that “union bosses” will only worsen airline security (never mind that other federal workers and all manner of police forces responsibly exercise that right) while suggesting that President Obama has been out to “appease the terrorists.”

The Senate’s Democratic leadership isn’t doing any better when it comes to the nomination of Alan Bersin, an experienced homeland security veteran of the Clinton administration, to be the new commissioner of customs and border protection. This is another bulwark security agency that was without an administration nominee until the summer.

In this case, the issue is neglect, not ideology. Mr. Bersin’s confirmation has been sidelined by the contentious Senate agenda. By now, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, surely realizes that he must make both positions an instant priority. If there’s any doubt, President Obama needs to forcefully remind him.
998 2009-12-31 A former Guinea-Bissau Navy chief who fled the country after being implicated in a failed 2008 coup has returned and is staying at the United Nations office there, officials said. The officer, Rear Adm. Bubo Na Tchuto, returned from exile in nearby Gambia this week in a canoe and disguised as a fisherman, according to local media. A statement on the Web site of the United Nations spokesman said the former navy chief had arrived “unannounced” and asked for protection. “We have been in constant contact with the authorities in Guinea-Bissau in an effort to resolve this situation peacefully,” the statement added.

Admiral Na Tchuto’s return prompted a tightening of security, including increased road checks. He is wanted in connection with a failed coup attempt last year against former President João Bernardo Vieira, who was later killed by renegade soldiers. Guinea-Bissau is now run by an elected government that is trying to stabilize the country.
999 2009-12-31 For 3-D video companies, an association with James Cameron’s “Avatar” is huge — it is the stamp of approval from the current multidimensional master.

Two companies, RealD and XpanD, have already trumpeted that Mr. Cameron looks favorably upon their technologies. But Dolby says its association is just as important, because its 3-D system was used at the movie’s world premiere in London on Dec. 10, at the Empire Leicester Square.

This was not an ordinary 3-D installation. Because the theater is so large (it seats 1,300) Dolby installed four digital projectors — two for each eye — to increase the amount of light that hit the screen.

With any 3-D glasses technology, the amount of light that hits the screen is reduced compared with standard 2-D projection. “Brightness is an area where all three systems are challenged,” said John Carey, vice president for worldwide sales at Dolby. “But our sharpness and more accurate color space offsets the brightness issues.”

This is not the first time a filmmaker has been used to promote a technology. THX, of course, was established in 1983 by George Lucas. ERIC A. TAUB
1000 2009-12-31 Ms. Qin, a fiery 28-year-old raised in the rough-and-tumble western region of Xinjiang, said she would never have signed the lease — with an agency affiliated with the developer that owns the property — had she known the building was about to be demolished. “We have no problem moving out,” she said last week, in front of her darkened restaurant. “We just want back the money we invested for renovations.”

She demanded exactly that amount: $74,000. The agency’s final offer was just over $5,000. This month, the electricity and water were shut off and a herd of orange excavator machines began tearing away at adjacent buildings, where the occupants had folded with less of a fight.

Chinese newspapers are filled with stories of battles involving so-called nail houses, the properties whose owners and occupants are like deeply embedded spikes that refuse to give way to redevelopment juggernauts. As an unceasing real-estate boom has swept the nation, much of it orchestrated by the local governments that benefit from soaring land values, property owners and occupants often protest unfair compensation.

Sometimes the clashes end tragically, as they did for five people who in recent months set themselves on fire rather than yield to the demolition crews. One woman, a 47-year-old business owner in Chengdu, died last month after pouring gasoline over her head and igniting it.

The episode, captured on video and posted on the Internet, provoked widespread anger over policies that even the central government has acknowledged are flawed. After the self-immolations, the State Council, China’s cabinet, said it would consider changing the nation’s property compensation laws, a potentially momentous reform that would address one of the biggest sources of social strife.

Until then, however, Ms. Qin would need a superhero.

Although her job advertisement prompted a host of curious phone calls and a spot on the nightly news, fewer than a dozen prospects were suitable — or willing to live in the unheated restaurant 24 hours a day until the bitter end. She rejected the earnest college students and the aspiring thugs and settled on a jovial, ponytailed retiree with fly-away eyebrows. Even if he appeared older than his stated age of 47, the retiree, Lu Daren, the father of two teenagers, seemed the ideal candidate. What he lacked in brute strength, he made up for in experience.

For years, Mr. Lu worked for the other side, as a “relocation man” who helped developers remove the implacable. Most of the time, he was in charge of negotiating compensation, he said, but he acknowledged that the business could sometimes get ugly.

“I was injured a few times, and other people got hurt, too,” he said, lighting up yet another cigarette. Once, after a relocation agreement was successfully concluded, he said, the wife of the ousted owner ran screaming from their condemned home and right into the path of a bulldozer. She died a few hours later.

Although Mr. Lu told himself she was mentally unwell, he was so shaken by the experience that he quit the business. “I decided one day I would atone for my wrongdoing and do something good for the world,” he said.

The Fish Castle, he decided, was the redemption he had been waiting for.

Mr. Lu’s first trial came two weeks into the job. On Tuesday of last week, as he posted a handwritten sign on the window that read “To Die Gloriously Is to Live Great,” he and witnesses said, about 60 men crashed through the restaurant’s front door and dragged him on to the pavement. He said he looked up to see the owner of the noodle shop — another holdout business — being thrashed and the man’s pregnant wife being kicked in the belly.

Then, for some inexplicable reason, the attackers retreated into their vehicles. Before they could drive away, Mr. Lu ran up to one of their vans and jammed the pole of his banner — the one that read “Nail House” — into the steering wheel, he said. In a moment of panic and shattered glass, the men abandoned their vehicles and ran off. The police came, poked around, and then left, saying they could not intervene in a commercial dispute, Mr. Lu and witnesses said.

Reached by phone, a spokesman for Eastern Victory, the agency that leased the space to Ms. Qin, declined to comment.

Last Thursday, as the temperature dipped well below zero, Mr. Lu and Ms. Qin recalled this and other skirmishes with their adversaries. As they spoke, a pack of grim-faced men in long dark coats circled the storefront, but then veered away when they found themselves receiving unwanted attention from a newspaper photographer.

In addition to Mr. Lu, Ms. Qin and her boyfriend, Zhong Boxin, the Fish Castle defenders include the restaurant’s former cooks and waiters. Everyone slept on banquettes piled high with blankets. “I feel small and insignificant on this planet,” Ms. Qin said quietly. “This is much more difficult than I imagined.”

Mr. Lu was far more hopeful. As the others dozed a few hours before Christmas, he said he thought the standoff would end soon, and in their favor. “It will happen before 2010,” he said buoyantly. “No one wants to drag old bad into the new year.”

Whether it was superstition or an old-fashioned victory of good over evil, the battle over the Fish Castle Restaurant ended in Ms. Qin’s favor. On Monday, she received a call from the developers, New Olympic Development, saying they hoped to strike a deal. Lawyers were summoned, papers were signed, full payment was guaranteed, and by Tuesday evening, the Fish Castle defenders had gathered up their blankets and abandoned their posts.

On Wednesday, Ms. Qin said she had already started looking for a new restaurant space. As for Mr. Lu, he said he hoped to continue fighting on behalf of other nail houses.
1001 2009-12-31 Business activity in the Midwest expanded more than expected in December, nearly hitting a four-year high, an industry association reported on Wednesday.

Employment in the group’s report posted its biggest monthly gain since September 2008.

The gain in employment, which has been a big concern as the economy struggles to overcome the worst recession in decades, was seen as strong evidence the recovery was gaining some traction.

The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer rose to 60.0, its highest reading since January 2006, from 56.1 in November. The result topped analysts’ median forecast of 55.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy.

“The number is a lot above consensus, and it bodes well for continued solid expectations as far as the economy and manufacturing goes. That’s going to be a vital part of 2010,” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.

The employment figure, after employers have been slashing jobs unrelentingly for nearly two years, was also seen as boding well for the economy.
1002 2009-12-31 But as early as late 2003, the Army historians assert, “it should have become increasingly clear to officials at Centcom and D.O.D. that the coalition presence in Afghanistan did not provide enough resources” for proper counterinsurgency, the historians write, referring to the Central Command and the Department of Defense.

“A Different Kind of War,” which covers the period from October 2001 until September 2005, represents the first installment of the Army’s official history of the conflict. Written by a team of seven historians at the Army’s Combat Studies Institute at Fort , Kan., and based on open source material, it is scheduled to be published by spring.

obtained a copy of the manuscript, which is still under review by current and former military officials.

Though other histories, including “In the Graveyard of Empires” by Seth G. Jones and “Descent Into Chaos” by Ahmed Rashid, cover similar territory, the manuscript of “A Different Kind of War” offers new details and is notable for carrying the imprimatur of the Army itself, which will use the history to train a new generation of officers.

The history, which has more than 400 pages, praises several innovations by the Pentagon, particularly the pairing of small Special Operations Forces teams with Afghan militias, which, backed by laser-guided weapons, drove the Taliban from power.

But, once the Taliban fell, the Pentagon often seemed ill-prepared and slow-footed in shifting from a purely military mission to a largely peacekeeping and nation-building one, fresh details in the history indicate.

“Even after the capture of and Kandahar,” the historians write, “there was no major planning initiated to create long-term political, social and economic stability in Afghanistan. In fact, the message from senior D.O.D officials in Washington was for the U.S. military to avoid such efforts.”

In one telling anecdote from 2004, the history describes how soldiers under General Barno had so little experience in counterinsurgency that one lieutenant colonel bought books about the strategy over the Internet and distributed them to his company commanders and platoon leaders.

In another case, a civil affairs commander in charge of small-scale reconstruction projects told the historians that he had been given $1 million in cash to house and equip his soldiers but that bureaucratic obstacles prevented him from spending a penny on projects. It took months to reduce the red tape, the historians say.

The historians also say that such anecdotes underscore the resourcefulness of commanders faced with unclear guidance and inadequate resources. But limited manpower still had an impact on operations, the history indicates.

When the Taliban was on the run in the spring of 2002, Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the incoming commander of American forces, traveled to Washington seeking guidance. The message conveyed by the Army’s vice chief of staff, Gen. Jack Keane, was, “Don’t you do anything that looks like permanence,” General McNeill recalled. “We are in and out of there in a hurry.”

Largely as a result of that mandate, General McNeill took only half of his headquarters command from the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C. But as the conflict became more complicated, requiring diplomatic and political operations as well as military ones, General McNeill lacked enough planning personnel, the history suggests. He was replaced in 2003 by an even smaller headquarters unit, the history says.

The lack of resources was also apparent in the training of Afghan security forces, the history shows.

Early in the war, the training program was hampered by poor equipment, low pay, high attrition and not enough trainers. Living conditions for the Afghan army were so poor that Maj. Gen. likened them to Valley Forge when he took command of the training operation in October 2002.

“The mandate was clear and it was a central task, but it is also fair to say that up until that time there had been few resources committed,” Mr. Eikenberry, now the ambassador to Afghanistan, told the historians, referring to the army training program.

The historians say resistance to providing more robust resources to Afghanistan had three sources in the White House and the Pentagon.

First, President and Defense Secretary had criticized using the military for peacekeeping and reconstruction in the Balkans during the 1990s. As a result, “nation building” carried a derogatory connotation for many senior military officials, even though American forces were being asked to fill gaping voids in the Afghan government after the Taliban’s fall.

Second, military planners were concerned about Afghanistan’s long history of resisting foreign invaders and wanted to avoid the appearance of being occupiers. But the historians argue that this concern was based partly on an “incomplete” understanding of the Soviet experience in Afghanistan.

Third, the invasion of Iraq was siphoning away resources. After the invasion started in March 2003, the history says, the United States clearly “had a very limited ability to increase its forces” in Afghanistan.

The history provides a detailed retelling of the battle of Tora Bora, the cave-riddled insurgent redoubt on the border where American forces thought they had trapped in December 2001. But Mr. bin Laden apparently escaped into Pakistan along with hundreds of Qaeda fighters.

The historians call Tora Bora “a lost opportunity” to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden. But they concluded that even with more troops, the American and Afghan forces probably could not have sealed the rugged border. And they deemed the battle a partial success because it “dealt a severe blow to those Taliban and elements that remained active in Afghanistan.”

The history also recounts well-known battles like Operation Anaconda, in eastern Afghanistan in spring 2002. The history ends in the fall of 2005, when many American officials still felt optimistic about Afghanistan’s future. Postponed parliamentary elections were held that fall, but Taliban attacks were also on the rise.

“It was clear that the struggle to secure a stable and prosperous future for Afghanistan was not yet won,” the history concludes.
1003 2009-12-31 The bank, which has seven regional offices to help small businesses export their goods and services, authorized $4.36 billion in 2,540 transactions to support small business exports in fiscal year 2009. And the bank, which turned 75 this year, is ready to do more, said Diane Farrell, a member of the bank’s board.

“We have the capacity to do direct lending, and in these changing times, we will be looking to do more of it,” she said.

Congress is urging the federal government to take a larger role in helping small businesses with exports. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship this month approved legislation to bolster small business trade opportunities, and asked the Small Business Administration to appoint an official to focus on international trade programs. Federal lawmakers have also asked Ronald Kirk, the United States trade representative, to appoint a top-level official to open overseas markets to more American small businesses.

Less than 1 percent of the nation’s nearly 26 million small businesses are exporters, said Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the Senate small business committee. Those 240,000 businesses, she said, account for only 29 percent of the United States’ export volume, a number that that has decreased in the last 10 years, according to a letter Senator Landrieu and the committee’s ranking Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, wrote to Mr. Kirk this year.

Even so, some small businesses said that in the current economic slump — federal statistics show overall exports by the United States fell 11.2 percent from October 2008 to October 2009 — their sales abroad remained strong and that they had been able to add jobs. Mr. Ickert of Air Tractor said the company had hired 30 people in the last year.

Engineered Systems and Equipment, a manufacturer of animal feed processing equipment in Caney, Kan., has more than doubled its work force recently, said its owner, Josef W. Barbi. He said the 26-year-old company now had 50 employees, an increase from the 20 in the last 18 months. “We are one of the few companies in our area who are still hiring,” Mr. Barbi said. Caney is in an economically depressed part of southeastern Kansas.

Last year, the Export-Import Bank insured a $500,000 deal for Engineered Systems to sell specialized pellet systems to a Honduran company, Proteina, which makes animal feed.

That was one of about $7 million in export deals in the last couple of years that Engineered Systems has made in Latin America. Backing from the Export-Import Bank has been crucial, he said, allowing his company to compete with European rivals.

While American exporters like Air Tractor are small enterprises, the business they do abroad can be large. Another Export-Import Bank client, Weldy-Lamont Associates, an engineering firm in Mount Prospect, Ill., relied on the bank’s financial support to win a $350 million rural electrification contract from the government of Ghana, said Patrick Hennelly, the company’s president.

The firm, with only 13 employees, used to design projects like paper mills in the Midwest, but has branched out to win contracts in Thailand, China and Yemen, Mr. Hennelly said.

Aided by an Export-Import Bank loan, Weldy-Lamont has taken a five-year electrification project in Ghana where, Mr. Hennelly said, “we’re putting in the wooden poles and stringing the wires to electrify villages across the whole country.”

The international projects are particularly timely, he said, because “the current economic crisis has stopped a couple of U.S. projects,” for his firm including coal and natural gas plants, from going forward.

Foreign projects can also lead to increased business orders inside the United States, said Kusum Kavia, co-owner and vice president of Combustion Associates, of Corona, Calif. Backed by Export-Import Bank insurance, her company won a multimillion-dollar contract to provide electric power generation systems to Benin. Ghana and Benin are in West Africa.

Parts for Benin’s 80-megawatt power plant power, Ms. Kavia said, come from suppliers in various regions of the United States. The gear boxes, for example, are made in Texas and the gear switchers in Pennsylvania. The generators are made in Ohio.

The portion of the Export-Import Bank’s financing for small business has increased in recent years, with prodding from Congress. In 2002, federal lawmakers told the bank to double small-business financing, from 10 to 20 percent, of the bank’s overall authorizations. The bank has met the goal every year since 2006.

Still, some lawmakers have said that the bank has cumbersome regulations and has not done enough to help small American businesses compete with heavily subsidized foreign competitors.

A 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office criticized the bank’s data and systems for tracking financing for small businesses. The bank has introduced Ex-Im Online, an automated transaction processing system to help small businesses and financial institutions speed through its paperwork. The same site, www.exim.gov, also has a small business portal for first-time applicants.

Small businesses can increase their chances of cracking the export market by doing their homework first, said Alan D. Andrews, vice president of PNC Bank’s global trade and equipment finance group, which works with the Export-Import Bank. That includes checking online state resources, too; each has an export assistance center, he said.

Companies can also turn to the United States Commercial Service (part of the Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration), which has market research and information about legal and other issues for each country. Its site is www.export.gov.
1004 2009-12-31 Looking back: Currently working as a personal assistant to a local cardiologist, Ms. Watson said she wished she’d rented from a small non-commercial landlord who might have been more flexible when times got tough.

At its peak: In its first 10 years, Yarbrough’s was one of the few restaurants in Johnson County. Just down the street from the town’s movie theater, it served some 600 people a day.

What went wrong: Yarbrough’s demographic began to age. And then, when the stock market dropped last year, even loyal customers began to cut their visits from three times a week to once every other week. In addition, the third-generation owner, Michael Yarbrough, says chain restaurants like Applebee’s trained people to expect assembly-line food instead of less-than-picture-perfect home cooking. Revenue, from a height of $3,000 a day a decade ago, fell by half.

Looking back: “I think me and my wife have done everything we could,” said Mr. Yarbrough, 40. “We tried extending hours for breakfast, opening seven days, and even a commercial on TV. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’ve been here basically my whole life. I made my first pie when I was 8.”

At its peak: In 2004 and 2005, the company was doing $40 million in annual sales and had more than 100 employees.

What went wrong: In September 2008, commodity prices suddenly began to plummet and the second-generation owner, Cliff Kane, found himself selling his inventory at cost. And then, with the recession, his sales volume dropped 40 percent. “You can get costs down over time,” Mr. Kane said, “but when you have the revenue drop we had with the margin drop, you can’t get small enough fast enough.”

Looking back: “I would like to stay in the business,” said Mr. Kane, who is 57. “This is all I’ve known for my professional career.” On Jan. 4th, he plans to start his job search.

At its peak: In 2007, Mel Royster moved from a 4,000-square-foot gym to a 16,000-square-foot gym. By 2008, he was pulling in some $65,000 a month in revenue and doing more than 300 personal training workouts a week.

What went wrong: Because Mr. Royster, 52, was paying $20,000 a month rent at his new location, he needed a packed house to break even. “Expanding was the first mistake,” he said. “I knew going in that working capital was going to be an issue. But, being stubborn, I did it anyway.” In early 2009, revenue began to fall, declining to $45,000 a month.

Looking back: “I didn’t have the right business people in place to generate the revenue I wanted,” said Mr. Royster, who believes his employees weren’t selling aggressively enough. “I tried to run it like a family, and I think I got a little too relaxed.”

At its peak: In 2000, the store brought in about $780,000 at its mall location across the street from the G.M. Technical Center, the car maker’s primary engineering operation.

What went wrong: G.M. layoffs reduced the Technical Center staff from a peak of more than 20,000 to some 12,000. After last year’s gas spike and credit market collapse, businesses abandoned the mall until only four remained. “Even the dollar store closed,” said Hallmark’s owner, John Greer, 50. “It was a ghost town.” With 2009 sales projected to hit only $400,000, Mr. Greer decided to shut down in March.

Looking back: A retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who bought the store in 2004, Mr. Greer says that if he’d been spending more time thinking about the future he would have moved to a new location. “I was doing marketing and sales, but you get so caught up you don’t pay attention to your growth strategy,” he said. Mr. Greer has founded Mind Over Management, a consulting firm aimed at helping companies carry out long-term strategies.

At its peak: One of the first companies to offer concierge outsourcing to residential and corporate clients, its revenue peaked at $2.5 million in 2007. By 2008, the owner, Cynthia Adkins, thinks, it was the longest operating luxury concierge service in the United States.

What went wrong: Corporate clients began cutting perks, and concierge services were one of the first. “This April, a corporate client of nine years gave us 30 days’ notice,” said Ms. Adkins. “They were crying when they called. I thought I could cut down costs to meet their budget. I didn’t think they’d take it out of the budget.” Revenue projected for 2009 fell to $80,000.

Looking back: In retrospect, Ms. Adkins believes she should have sold the business. “I would have loved to move on when it was doing well,” said Ms. Adkins, 50. “I could have parlayed it into something better. But when random calls came interested in me or the company, I wasn’t prepared.” Today, Ms. Adkins is selling CORE, a “concierge in a box” set-up and training system based on her business.
1005 2009-12-31 At first, my husband did not take it well. “You always were a sucker for vintage charm,” he said in the betrayed tone of someone who once dreamed of a different kind of life, in a midcentury modern.

We talked it out, though, and within a few days, he understood. He admitted that he’d lately been tempted, too, what with housing prices lower than they had been in years. And after we sat at the kitchen table for a heart-to-heart, he even started to sound a little hopeful. We ran some numbers: if the deal went through, we would cut our housing expenses in half.

I reached across the table and covered his hand with mine. “You’ll look back on this someday, when the hurt and pain of packing up 100 boxes of books is a distant memory, and realize it was for the best,” I promised.

But my children took it very hard.

“You don’t love our house anymore?” asked Clementine, who is 12.

“People change, sweetie,” I said. “Sometimes they grow apart from their houses. That doesn’t mean I won’t always have a place in my heart for this house.”

“But I don’t want to move to a new neighborhood,” she said. “How will I do math homework with Sam?”

“We’ll only be two blocks away,” I pointed out. “You can practically see the new house from here.”

She looked skeptical. I sweetened the deal. “It’s right down the street from that nail place that has the wide selection of glossy celebrity magazines,” I reminded her.

She perked up. “Can I have the big bedroom?” she asked, and I knew she’d be fine.

But the next morning I got a text from my middle daughter, Ella, 18, who was at college in New York.

“When were you planning to break the bad news to me?” she wrote.

“It’s not bad news,” I wrote back. “We’ll still be a family.”

“You have three children. You are buying a house with two bedrooms,” she wrote.

“We’re going to add on a third bedroom,” I wrote reassuringly. “There will be plenty of room. Remember how you and Zoe used to share a room?”

They say it’s a natural part of becoming an adult, when you start to realize — gradually — that the house where you grew up isn’t where you live anymore. You begin to understand that the phrase “childhood home” actually means the place where people tried their best to prepare you for your own life.

Some children take it gracefully. Others, like Jonathan Franzen, write thinly veiled autobiographical novels excoriating their parents.

“Do me a favor,” I pleaded, “don’t read ‘The Corrections’ until you give the new house a chance.”

But I was starting to worry. Was I being selfish? Would it scar my children for life if I disturbed the shrines of their bedrooms, transporting bulletin boards full of snapshots and little plaster handprints from kindergarten and desiccated flower bouquets from past proms to a new location two blocks away?

The next day, Zoe, my eldest daughter, arrived home from college for winter break. I was at the new house that morning, walking through empty rooms with an architect, when I glanced out the window and saw our station wagon pull abruptly to the curb.

Zoe, 20, got out of the car. She stopped for a second at the gate to appraise the house. Then she walked up the steps, through the front door and, rapidly, took a turn through the living room, the dining room, the back hall. I wafted behind her. She paused in the kitchen, leaned over the sink to look out at the little fountain in the backyard, and then turned to face me.

“It’s adorable,” she said. “I love it. And the garden is wonderful.”

“You really like it?” I asked, relieved that at least one of my daughters was ready to face the future.

“It’s perfect,” she reassured me. Then she added, “And I think Clem and Ella will be fine with sharing a bedroom.”
1006 2009-12-31 WEISS--Harry. The Guidance Center mourns the loss of Harry Weiss, an ardent supporter and longtime board member. His legacy of helping people in need and his strong business sense stays with us....
