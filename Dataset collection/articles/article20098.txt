1 2009-08-01 Michelin, the European tire maker, generated 575 million euros ($912 million) of cash in the first half as the company cut production more rapidly than sales declined. While Michelin had a net loss of 119 million euros in the period, the company reported an operating profit of 282 million euros on sales of more expensive tires. Operating profit excludes some one-time items. Revenue fell 13 percent to 7.13 billion euros, with a shift in demand to more expensive tire brands and models helping limit the slide, the company said.
2 2009-08-01 An appeals court ordered a new, shorter sentence on Friday for Joseph P. Nacchio, left, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International, saying his six-year term for insider trading was too long. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that the trial judge had overstated the amount of Mr. Nacchio’s financial gain.

Mr. Nacchio was convicted in 2007 of 19 counts of insider trading. Prosecutors said he had sold $52 million in Qwest stock when the company was in financial trouble, information he concealed from the public. On Friday, a three-judge panel agreed with Mr. Nacchio’s lawyers that the $52 million figure was too high. Instead, the figure used should have been the net profit resulting from illegal insider trading.

The appeals court did not say what Mr. Nacchio’s sentence or fine should be, sending those determinations back to a lower court. Mr. Nacchio has appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court but was ordered to begin serving his prison term in April. He is at the minimum-security Pennsylvania Federal Correctional Institution Schuylkill satellite camp in Minersville, Pa.
3 2009-08-01 Skeptics say that Mr. Zapatero, for all his imagination, has run up against his own unwillingness to carry out the painful structural reforms that business leaders and the country’s central bank say are inevitable if Spain is to fight unemployment and take its economy into the 21st century.

“My government’s ambition is to make this an innovative, creative, entrepreneurial country while upholding the social welfare state,” Mr. Zapatero said.

“Some people will say that a social welfare state and a competitive economy are incompatible, that innovation is incompatible with workers’ rights,” he said. “They want to deregulate workers’ rights, deregulate social rights. That is exactly the same tune as people who say we have to deregulate the financial markets, and I do not dance to that tune.”

Instead, Mr. Zapatero added, “it’s a question of making companies more competitive and more innovative.” He said Spain should diversify its economy to sectors in which it excels and which are showing growth, including renewable energy, biotechnology, civil engineering and high-speed railroads.

“Zapatero has been saying this since before he became prime minister, and the fact that he is still saying these things is an indication of how little has been done,” said José Antonio Herce, the chief economist at Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a financial consultancy based in Madrid. “For the past five years, we’ve been laying bricks, not making iPods.”

Indeed, Spain rose and fell so quickly because its boom was fueled by cheap credit and construction. That helped its economy grow an average of 3.8 percent a year from 1997 to 2007, and to bring four million new immigrants to a country that now has a population of 46 million people. (Many are now heading back home.)

When the housing bubble burst and the global recession hit, Spain fell faster than its neighbors. Four million people are unemployed. Half receive government benefits. For all its growth, the country still lags in productivity rates and labor costs.

In the interview, Mr. Zapatero contended that most job losses were in the construction sector. To stem them, the government has introduced a $15 billion infrastructure plan.

Another sticking point is Spain’s two-tier labor system. For all of Mr. Zapatero’s defense of workers’ rights, Spanish workers on permanent contracts have far more protections than those on temporary ones, who make up much of the nation’s unemployed.

“Workers’ protection does vary, it is true,” Mr. Zapatero said. “We are working on it. We have to increase part-time employment; we do have to make the labor market more flexible in that sense.” He added that the government was “making progress” on that front, “but we do have some way to go.”

Talks between the government, unions and business leaders broke down last week after the government refused the business sector’s demand that its contributions to the social security system and the cost of firing or laying off workers be reduced. Under the current system, to lay off workers, Spanish companies have to pay them 30 to 45 days’ salary for each year worked. Businesses had unsuccessfully asked the government to reduce that to 20 days’ salary.

Mr. Zapatero said he would not try to make it easier for businesses to lay off workers. “Twenty-first-century democratic Spain is not a country that is going to take a single step back in terms of rights that we have conquered,” he said. “When I see a worker, I see a citizen.”

But Lorenzo Amor, the leader of the national federation of self-employed workers, said small and medium-size companies, which account for more than 90 percent of companies in Spain, were staggering under inflexible labor rules.

“In this country we have over a million households where nobody has a job,” Mr. Amor said.

“Ask those million households if they would prefer a work contract that offered 20 days’ pay,” he added, referring to the reduced compensation proposed by business leaders. “They would say yes. They want to work.”

Political and economic analysts acknowledged that Mr. Zapatero, a committed Socialist, was unlikely to take on the tough structural reforms that his right-leaning predecessor, José María Aznar, could not pull off during the fat years.

Mr. Zapatero said the government could finance its initiatives by taking on more debt. “I think we should learn the lesson of the Great Depression. When an economy enters a deep recession, the only way we can come out of it is from a big push from the public sector,” he said.

For now, Mr. Zapatero still has some refuge from the economic turmoil. Spain, which once counted Julio Iglesias as perhaps its best-known international figure, continues to shine in tennis, cycling, cuisine and even basketball — a fact the prime minister noted with undisguised delight.

And with that, Mr. Zapatero was off — to receive Alberto Contador, who came from behind for his second victory in the Tour de France.
4 2009-08-01 The United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concern on Friday over the fate of a Chadian teenager held in prison for five years after being accused of poisoning the elderly man she was forced to marry. The committee, in Geneva, said that the girl, Khadidja Ousmane Mahamat, who was forced into an arranged marriage when she was 13, had been in prison since 2004 on charges of poisoning her 70-year-old husband, but that she had not yet been tried. She was raped by a prison official while in detention and has borne a child as a result, the committee said in a report.
5 2009-08-01 In “Methland vs. Mythland” (column, July 21), Timothy Egan talks about the methamphetamine epidemic that has been created by alarmist media coverage. The meth epidemic still exists in the minds of some small-town citizens.

Recently the City Council of Washington, Mo., became the first local government in the country to require a prescription for cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine, a substance that can be used to manufacture methamphetamine. This action was the result of the Missouri Legislature’s inaction to combat the meth problem and has attracted interest from other cities, setting a dangerous precedent.

The war on drugs creates convenient vehicles of seemingly being tough on crime while hiding behind the shield of public safety. But this shield gets worn down when our basic rights are curtailed through its use.

We need to invest scarce public resources into educating the public about the use of meth and providing high-quality treatment options to cure addiction, not create needless legislation.

6 2009-08-01 A court issued a warrant on Friday for the arrest of the former head of the American chemical company responsible for a gas leak that killed at least 10,000 people and sickened more than half a million. In response to a recent appeal by a victims’ group, the court ordered the arrest of Warren M. Anderson, who was the chief executive of Union Carbide when its pesticide factory in Bhopal leaked 40 tons of poisonous gas on Dec. 3, 1984, the world’s worst industrial disaster. Mr. Anderson was arrested immediately afterward, but he soon left India.
7 2009-08-01 The amendment is part of the bill that gives the District of Columbia its federal appropriation for 2010.

Since Washington is not part of a state, Congress controls its system of government. And for nearly a decade, members — citing concerns about worsening drug abuse — inserted language into the city’s budget bill that prohibited financing needle exchange programs.

“Children should not be out playing kickball and watching people exchange needles for illegal drug use,” said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia and the sponsor of the current amendment.

A spokesman for Mr. Kingston added that the congressman was willing to work toward a compromise regarding the distance from places where children gather but that he had not heard from Ms. Norton or Mayor Adrian M. Fenty on the matter.

The city, which first financed needle exchange programs in April 2008, already prohibits needle exchanges within 1,000 feet of schools.

The amendment expands on that prohibition by forbidding such programs within 1,000 feet “of a public or private day care center, elementary school, vocational school, secondary school, college, junior college, or university, or any public swimming pool, park, playground, video arcade, or youth center, or an event sponsored by any such entity.”

“We mapped what was left, and we essentially could only operate in graveyards or in the middle of the Potomac River,” said Mary Beth Levin, director of programs and services at Prevention Works, one of the city’s needle exchange programs.

Most exchange programs are mobile and occur near parks, Ms. Levin said.

Mr. Fenty said he intended to get the amendment “stripped from the final appropriations bill for this budget year.”

Washington had one of the highest rates of reported AIDS cases among American cities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate in 2007 was 34.5 reported cases per 100,000 people, compared with 41.7 in San Francisco; 36.6 in New York; 36.5 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and 35.4 in Miami, a disease centers report said.

While the centers estimate that a quarter of Americans living with H.I.V. do not know they are infected, one-third to one-half of city residents may be unaware of their positive status, according to a report by Washington’s Department of Health.

A spokeswoman for the department, Dena Iverson, said that from October 2008 to June 2009, about 210,000 needles were exchanged and the city enrolled more than 1,000 new clients. The program also distributed 200,000 condoms and referred nearly 300 clients into drug detox/treatment.

Roughly 15 percent of all new infections are related to injection drug use, according to a city health report that used 2007 data.
8 2009-08-01 Chevron said Friday that its profit fell 71 percent in the second quarter and that it would suspend its entire land-based natural gas drilling operation, citing dismal demand.

“By the end of the year, we will not have a single gas land-rig running,” George Kirkland, Chevron’s executive vice president for global upstream and gas, said in a conference call.

With natural gas falling to about a quarter of its value last year, “it really doesn’t make sense right now to be drilling those gas wells,” he said.

Chevron said its net income amounted to $1.75 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter. That compared with $5.98 billion, or $2.90 a share, a year earlier.

The company said its net income suffered from a weak United States dollar, amounting to $453 million in reduced earnings. That compared with an income benefit of $126 million in the comparable period last year.
9 2009-08-01 ArtsConnection, a nonprofit arts education group based in New York, has acquired High 5 Tickets to the Arts, which provides $5 tickets to middle school and high school students and was about to close because of the economic downturn. The organizations have entered into a six-month alliance that will culminate in a formal merger on Jan. 1. High 5 will then be called ArtsConnection’s High 5 Program. By merging, they expect to serve more than 50,000 young people over the next year, reaching students from elementary through high school. Over the past 13 years, High 5 has, with the help of TicketMaster, annually provided tickets for 16,000 teenagers to attend New York-area theater, dance, music and visual arts events. ArtsConnection, founded in 1979, has served more than three million young people over the last 30 years, working mainly with elementary school students.
10 2009-08-01 A jury decided on Friday that a Boston University graduate student who admitted to downloading more than 800 songs from the Internet between 1999 and 2007 should pay $675,000 in damages to four record labels for copyright violations, The Associated Press reported. The student, Joel Tenenbaum, right, testified Thursday in federal district court in Boston that he had downloaded and shared hundreds of songs by artists including Nirvana, Green Day and the Smashing Pumpkins, and said he had lied in pretrial depositions when he said friends or siblings may have downloaded the songs to his computer. The record labels involved in the case have focused on 30 songs that Mr. Tenenbaum, 25, downloaded. Under federal law they were entitled to $750 to $30,000 for each infringement, but the jury was permitted to raise that to as much as $150,000 a track if it found the infringements were willful.
11 2009-08-01 John Senden shot a 66 to take the second-round lead at 14 under, two shots ahead of Michael Letzig (65) and three in front of Vaughn Taylor (68) and Bill Lunde (65).

Senden is shooting for his second PGA Tour title and first in three years. He has four top-10 finishes this season, including a pair of fourth-place ties.

Woods’s sensational start surpassed the five under he had on his first five holes in 2006 — the same ones he had success on Friday at Nos. 10-14 — when he went on to win his second Buick Open and his 50th PGA Tour title.

He had his best round, in relation to par, since an 11-under 61 at the 2005 Buick Open, when he also opened with a 71. His last 63 helped him repeat at the 2007 P.G.A. Championship.

John Daly shot an 88, his worst score in a regular PGA Tour event. He finished at 20-over 160. Chris DiMarco (75) missed the four-under cut, which was the lowest this season on the PGA Tour, by a stroke. Scott Verplank (75) was six shots away from making it to the weekend after finishing in the top 10 in his last three tournaments.

Daly’s swing coach, Rick Smith, described Daly as being in a “toxic state,” which Smith attributed to a massive weight loss, not enough sleep and the wrong kind of diet.

“The last two weeks have been the first time in my career I didn’t think I could win,” said Daly, who said he had lost more than 80 pounds in the last four months.

“I don’t have the feel I used to have. I don’t have the confidence. I just don’t have it.” He added: “I’ve thrown in the towel and shot 82 when I quit. But I didn’t quit this time. It was a weird feeling.”

TWO SHARE LEAD AT BRITISH Catriona Matthew of Scotland had a hole in one in a round of five-under 67 to share the second-round lead with Giulia Sergas of Italy at the Women’s British Open.

Sergas also shot 67 after making five birdies on the back nine. Each player totaled three-under 141 at England’s Royal Lytham and St. Annes links course.

Playing 10 weeks after having her second child, Matthew eagled the 11th and followed up with an ace on the 12th. She then made four more birdies against a lone bogey for a course record on the back nine of seven-under 30.

Yuko Mitsuka (71) was a shot back in third. The first-round leader Sandra Gal of Germany (80) and Angela Stanford (76), who was tied for second Thursday, had disappointing rounds.

Top-ranked Lorena Ochoa dropped five shots on the front nine and finished with an eight-over 77.

Cristie Kerr jarred her wrist playing out of a divot at the sixth and went for treatment after her round of 71.

AMATEUR LEADS SENIOR OPEN The Tennessee amateur Tim Jackson left Greg Norman and Joey Sindelar behind at the United States Senior Open.

The 50-year-old Jackson, a real estate developer, shot a five-under 67 at Crooked Stick in Carmel, Ind., to take the lead at 11-under 133 — matching the lowest 36-hole total at a senior Open. He opened with a 66 on Thursday, the best score by an amateur in tournament history.

Norman stumbled early in the round, but recovered nicely, ending the round with two straight birdies to get to eight under. He was three strokes back after a 70.

Sindelar was a stroke behind Jackson. He started on the back nine and followed his course-record 66 with a 68.

Fred Funk (67) was third at nine under.

Tom Watson, the darling of the golf world after nearly winning the British Open, shot a par 72 to finish the first two rounds at one under — 11 strokes back.

“I don’t like being this far behind,” Watson, 59, said. “I’m going to have to drive the ball better, put myself in a better position.”
12 2009-08-01 One of the more doltish entries in the torture subgenre, “The Collector” drags itself along the road paved by the seemingly inexhaustible “Saw” franchise as if bored by its own sadism. The opening image, of moths trapped in a street light, is particularly apt: by the time the blood begins to flow, you’ll be feeling just like those exhausted insects.

Cue thunder and lightning, tinkling chandelier and twitchy close-ups. A ferretlike handyman (Josh Stewart) is robbing the home of supposedly vacationing clients when he stumbles on a second intruder: a ninja-masked psycho. Elaborate guillotines rigged with pulleys and wires (did the psycho move in a week ago?) are supplemented by acid-washed floors (alas, poor kitty!) and various pointy devices.

Confronting literal and ideological bilge (like a killer angered only by homophobic insults), the handyman decides that his fingers and teeth are small sacrifices compared with saving lives.

Feebly directed by Marcus Dunstan (a contributor to “Saw IV” through “VI”), “The Collector” offers agony in a vacuum, a villain without a motive and a hero with more personal problems than lines of dialogue. Luckily, the director can explain his leading man’s lack of volubility.

“So much of the movie is watching him think — and that’s a lot of heavy lifting,” he says in the press notes. You said it, Mr. Dunstan, not me.

“The Collector” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Nails in the brain, pliers on the tongue and breasts in the hand.

13 2009-08-01 A YEAR ago, the American economy was in recession. Now it may be about to emerge from that downturn.

But if the economy is about to begin growing again, it will be from a very low level. The recession has produced declines far greater than in previous downturns over the past half-century. As a result, the economy may seem to be depressed even after growth resumes.

One area where that can be seen is shipments of durable goods produced by American companies. The rate of such shipments fell by more than 20 percent during this recession, and would have declined further were it not for increased production of weapons.

In no previous downturn since 1958, when the figures began being recorded, had the decline been as much as 14 percent.

The drop is all the more remarkable because such shipments rose at a relatively restrained rate in the preceding period of economic growth, particularly when military sales were excluded.

The accompanying charts show the trend in durable goods spending, for military purposes and for other shipments of durable goods, from 2000 through this June. In June, seasonally adjusted shipments for civilian purposes were 19 percent below the average monthly figure for 2000. Shipments of military items were running 123 percent above the 2000 average.
14 2009-08-01 BANGKOK  A court in Myanmar on Friday delayed a highly anticipated verdict in a case against the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, citing technical legal reasons, according to reports from Yangon, the country’s main city.

“They cited a legal issue that had arisen, and that’s it,” said a diplomat, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.

The diplomat confirmed news agency reports that a new date of Aug. 11 had been set for the reading of the verdict, which could send Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to prison for five years.

Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, is charged with violating the terms of the house arrest under which she has been held for 14 of the past 19 years. She has been in prison since her arrest on May 14.

The case involves an incident in which an American intruder swam across a lake and spent two nights in her villa on a mission, as he told the court, to save her from assassins.

Also on Friday, Burmese exile sources said the authorities had detained as many as 30 pro-democracy advocates and members of the National League for Democracy, the country’s main opposition group. But they said it seemed that an unknown number of them had been held only briefly and then released.

Analysts say they believe that the case is aimed at keeping Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in detention through an election that is planned for early next year. Her latest six-year term of house arrest expired in mid-May.

The election is part of a “road map to democracy” under a new Constitution that would legitimize the military control that has isolated and impoverished the country, formerly called Burma, since a coup in 1962.

It would be the first nationwide election since 1990; the military annulled that election after the National League for Democracy won in a landslide.

In a telephone interview before the court session, U Nyan Win, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s lawyer, said that he told reporters in Yangon that his client was not surprised by the delay, and that she expected to be convicted.

“She’s mentally very good,” he said. “She can command our team. She’s in good spirits.”

Most foreign reporters are barred from entering Myanmar, but Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi told diplomats who were allowed to attend the final session of the case on Tuesday, “I’m afraid the verdict will be painfully obvious.”

Jared M. Genser, a lawyer who works on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s case for Freedom Now, an American nonprofit organization that seeks to free political prisoners, said in an e-mail message that the delay was “in some ways a smart move” by the ruling generals.

“Push off the verdict until the middle of August, when numerous government and United Nations officials around the world will be on vacation,” he said.

The intruder, John Yettaw, 53, of Falcon, Mo., also faces at least five years in prison as an accomplice in violating the house arrest, as well as for other charges.

16 2009-08-02 Nicholas D. Kristof makes a strong point when he writes that “Pakistan should be President Obama’s top foreign policy challenge.” Pakistan, the world’s sixth largest country, is nuclear-armed and is facing a serious challenge from radical Islam in several manifestations — Al Qaeda and the Taliban being the best known.

Examining ways to make our aid to Pakistan more effective is important; so is supporting the country’s democratic institutions. But if Pakistan’s nuclear weapons fall into the wrong hands (or North Korea’s weapons become more accurate, or Iran is simply provided sufficient time and space), history will probably not judge these efforts sufficient.

A Qaeda statement issued in June read in part: “God willing, the nuclear weapons [in Pakistan] will not fall into the hands of the Americans, and the mujahedeen would take them and use them against the Americans.”

Neither rogue regimes nor extremist groups would have much use for nuclear-armed missiles if the United States were to develop a comprehensive, multilayered missile defense system. The technology to do this already exists. Financing decisions on missile defense are now being taken up by Congress. Cuts are likely.

The administration should continue its efforts to prevent Pakistan’s slide toward instability and extremism, but should also fully put in place the means to make missiles useless to aggressors.

17 2009-08-02 Some Bush administration officials feared that the government in Baghdad might crack down on the Iranian dissidents in Iraq once Iraqi troops assumed control of the country at the beginning of this year. Through the years, Iranian officials have continually demanded that the dissidents be returned to Iran, where many could be imprisoned, and aides to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq have publicly hinted that they would comply with Iran’s demands.

Officials in Tehran have called Tuesday’s police raid against Camp Ashraf “admirable.” But senior United States military and diplomatic officials said that as more details about the raid emerged, it appeared to be less a concerted crackdown on the dissidents than a police operation gone awry.

The Iraqi police were hoping to establish an outpost inside the camp, and tensions escalated into a violent clash when the dissidents resisted, Iraqi officials said. Several members of the People’s Mujahedeen were killed.

The American Embassy in Baghdad sent a delegation to meet with Iraqi authorities to remind them of their written commitment not to mistreat the dissidents or send them back to Iran. The Americans got approval to send a team of military medics into the camp to treat the injured Iranians. And the Americans have asked the Iraqis for a formal investigation of what went wrong in the raid.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has also weighed in with Iraqi officials about their obligation to respect the desires of the dissidents not to be returned to Iran against their will.

But a senior State Department official said there was some skepticism that the Iraqis were taking these concerns seriously.

“The Iraqis will tell you what you want to hear,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “That’s why we’re going to continue to watch the situation very closely.”

The concern that the Iranian dissident group could become a bargaining chip in Iraqi relations with Tehran created a rift in the Bush administration about whether to remove the group from the terrorism list.

The People’s Mujahedeen has been on the State Department list because of decades of terrorist activities, mostly against Iranian targets, it carried out beginning in the 1970s. It has been several years since the group has carried out an attack.

In the Bush administration’s final days, the State Department’s top counterterrorism official, Dell L. Dailey, pushed to have the People’s Mujahedeen removed from the list, which would have allowed members of the group to leave Iraq and resettle elsewhere in the Middle East or Europe. Without lifting the terrorist designation, it was unlikely any other country would accept them.

Some also argued that taking the group off the terrorism list would send a tough message to Iran as the Bush administration left office. Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state at the time, decided to keep the group on the list.

In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Dailey said that the Obama administration and the United Nations should intervene to protect the Iranian group’s members, especially the women and children.

“There needs to be a coordinated policy decision so the people aren’t abandoned there in central Iraq,” he said.

Yet Obama administration officials said they were unlikely to remove the group from the terrorism list anytime soon, and there is no sign that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is even considering such a step.

This move would no doubt further unsettle Washington’s relations with Tehran at a time when the Obama White House has made engagement with Iran a cornerstone of its foreign policy. Some in the White House and the State Department say privately that the administration’s efforts to reach out to Iran, even in the wake of its bloody post-election crackdown, have further complicated calculations about the dissident group.

“That’s what makes it so hard,” a State Department official said. “There’s too much uncertainty right now about what’s going on in Iran.”
18 2009-08-02 Re “An Early-Warning System, Run by the Fed,” (Economic View, July 26), in which Alan S. Blinder suggested making the Federal Reserve the nation’s regulator of systemic risk:

The column said that “when truly systemic problems arise, a lender of last resort is almost certain to be part of the solution — and that means the central bank.” But to me this description is an argument for a new, independent regulator outside the central bank. We need a system that clearly discredits the “too big to fail” mentality. Having a “lender of last resort” as the systemic risk regulator keeps this mentality alive.

A separate regulator should have the power to seize and wind down operations of a failing institution. Keeping this power apart from the Fed also prevents it from being drawn into the political maelstrom of whether to lend funds to a weakened institution or to seize it for an orderly winddown.

In a crisis, the Fed should do what it does best: provide liquidity to the system without picking which institutions will survive or perish. Jonathan Adams

19 2009-08-02 Catriona Matthew of Scotland opened a three-shot lead at the Women’s British Open on Saturday at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club after a one-under-par 71 in the third round.

Matthew, who is playing just 10 weeks after giving birth to her second child, bogeyed two of her first four holes but recovered with three birdies to reach a four-under total of 212.

Christina Kim of the United States was second at one under. The defending champion Jiyai Shin of South Korea shot a 68 to climb into a tie for third place with Ai Miyazato of Japan at even par.

Shin said she switched drivers after a 77 in the first round but went back to her original Saturday.

“Today I was really good, the driver was good, everything was good,” Shin said. “I’m following the leaders now. I’m not far away. This course is very tough so I have a chance.”

Song-Hee Kim of South Korea (74) and Mika Miyazato of Japan (69) were tied for fifth at one over.

Paula Creamer recovered from two straight 74s to shoot a 70 and climb to a share of seventh place.
20 2009-08-02 Or, as Mr. Allison explained, “put balls and chains on good people, and bad things happen.”

Ms. Rand, who died in 1982, has all sorts of admirers on Wall Street, in corporate boardrooms and in the entertainment industry, including the hedge fund manager Clifford Asness, the former baseball great Cal Ripken Jr. and the Whole Foods chief executive, John Mackey.

But Mr. Allison, who remains BB&T’s chairman after retiring as chief executive in December, has emerged as perhaps the most vocal proponent of Ms. Rand’s ideas and of the dangers of government meddling in the markets. For a dedicated Randian like him, the government’s headlong rush to try to rescue and fix the economy is a horrifying realization of his worst fears.

Indeed, so many bad things are happening that many followers of Ms. Rand, known as objectivists, believe that the ugly scenario in her 1957 novel “Atlas Shrugged” — in which the government takes over industry as the economy progressively collapses — is playing out in real life.

New regulations are being enacted by the day. The rich may be forced to pay for health care for the poor. The auto industry is a ward of the state. An activist administration occupies the White House. And, of course, the federal government has inserted itself into the nation’s banks, including BB&T, which accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

“Rand predicted what would happen 50 years ago,” says Mr. Allison, who notes that his bank was forced to take the money, which he labels “a rip-off.” “It’s a nightmare for anyone who supports individual rights.”

But as cringe-inducing as the government’s actions may be for objectivists like him, there is a silver lining: sales of “Atlas Shrugged,” which Ms. Rand considered her definitive work, are better than ever.

In the first six months of 2009, Penguin Books shipped more than 300,000 copies of the book, which opens with the famous question, “Who is John Galt?” That’s 25 percent more than in all of 2008.

“It’s just gone through the roof,” said Kara Welsh, publisher for the New American Library, a division of Penguin. There’s even a renewed effort to make a miniseries out of the book. The studio Lionsgate, along with the producers Howard and Karen Baldwin, hope to begin shooting as early as next spring.

“It is incredibly timely,” said Michael Burns, vice chairman of Lionsgate.

While book sales haven’t translated into a flood of new converts to objectivism, Yaron Brook, president of the Ayn Rand Institute, said attendance at this year’s Objectivist Summer Conference in Boston — where Mr. Allison delivered his speech — was the best yet for an East Coast event. (Attendance at conferences on the West Coast, where the institute is based, tends to be 25 percent higher, he says.)

Among the participants was Dr. Shira Miller, who became interested in Ms. Rand’s writing in college. She says objectivism continues to provide her with “a moral philosophy for how to live a good and happy life.”

Dr. Miller, who practices age-management medicine in Los Angeles, doesn’t accept Medicare or health insurance so there can be no third-party interference with her individual rights or those of her patients, she says. “Medicine is a product just like any other,” says Dr. Miller, likening it to toasters, computers or legal advice. “I should have the right to sell or trade it on my own terms, just like any other business owner.”

For his part, Mr. Brook is encouraged by the new interest in Ms. Rand’s work, but feels that it has yet to have much impact on the political debate. He’s also struggling to change a popular perception that the financial crisis was caused by deregulation and the fiscal policies of a top Rand disciple: Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman.

Mr. Brook argues that the problem wasn’t deregulation, but “misregulation.” He also says it’s unfortunate that Mr. Greenspan continues to be associated with Ms. Rand. While the two were close in the 1960s and ’70s, Mr. Greenspan abandoned objectivism decades ago, he says. Through a spokesman, Mr. Greenspan declined to comment.

“If you look at every aspect of the political world, things are going against us, from health care to cap-and-trade,” Mr. Brook says. “And it’s accepted wisdom that the financial crisis was caused by capitalism.”

“In the narrow sense of objectivism, things have never been so good,” he adds. “When you look at the larger world, it’s pretty depressing.”

THE enduring popularity of Ms. Rand bewilders her many detractors, who complain that her writing is melodramatic, heavy-handed and intellectually bereft.

“To describe her as a minor figure in the history of philosophical thinking about knowledge and reality would be a wild overstatement,” says Brian Leiter, director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of Chicago. “She’s irrelevant.”

Professor Leiter conducted an informal poll in March on his philosophy blog, asking, “Which person do you most wish the media would stop referring to as a ‘philosopher’?” The choices were Jacques Derrida, Ms. Rand and Leo Strauss. Ms. Rand won by a landslide, with 75 percent of the roughly 1,500 votes cast.

Professor Leiter says Ms. Rand’s views on moral philosophy and objective reality are “simple-minded in the extreme.”

“She doesn’t understand the historical positions of thinkers on these issues, such as Hume and Kant,” he says. “Even the minority of philosophers with some sympathy for her celebration of the virtues of selfishness usually find her general philosophical system embarrassing.”

Others contend that a lack of constraints on self-interested and greedy business people set the financial crisis in motion — a view that tends to undermine Ms. Rand’s theories on the value and social benefits of unfettered ambition and limited government.

“It takes a great leap of ideological blindness to look at the past few years and think that the main problem was too much government involvement,” said Robert B. Reich, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was a labor secretary in the Clinton administration.

Mark A. Thoma, an economist at the University of Oregon, says the financial crisis would have been worse if the government hadn’t rapidly intervened.

“I completely disagree with the idea that letting the markets heal themselves is the best idea,” he says. “We tried that in the ’30s, and it didn’t work out so well.”

Fiscal conservatives take an opposite tack, arguing that the government has intervened in overly aggressive and risky ways. They find much to praise in Ms. Rand’s economic views. Yet even for that crowd, her social views are a tougher sell.

Ms. Rand was an ardent atheist who considered the cross a symbol of how “a man of perfect virtue” sacrificed himself for a bunch of losers. “It is in the name of that symbol that men are asked to sacrifice themselves for their inferiors,” she said.

She had little time for women who stay home to raise children. Ms. Rand wrote sex scenes that one critic recently described as “dark, kinky and weird, but not in a good way,” in which normally tough businesswomen melt under the steely gaze and rough hand of übercapitalists.

Even so, Ms. Rand’s books have sold briskly without the sanction of academics and book critics since they were published.

Her black-and-white views were shaped by her upbringing in Russia, where her father’s pharmacy was taken over by Communists, who also suppressed free thought at her university. In 1926, she came to the United States, which she had idealized as a free nation that valued human achievement.

A short, chain-smoking woman with a severe haircut and heavy Russian accent, she once worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and fashioned herself as “a radical for capitalism.” As her reputation grew, she was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Phil Donahue and Playboy magazine.

A member of her New York salon was the young economist Mr. Greenspan. Ms. Rand called him “the Undertaker” for his dark clothing and dour manner.

Mr. Greenspan, who wrote an article for one of Ms. Rand’s nonfiction books advocating a gold standard, was among those who listened to and praised early drafts of “Atlas Shrugged,” which Ms. Rand started writing in 1946.

It tells the story of Dagny Taggart, a brilliant and leggy railroad executive who steamrolls the “looters” and “moochers” who populate a deteriorating America to keep her trains running on time.

She is part of a loose collection of can-do industrialists who struggle against a rising tide of government intervention that seeks to lessen competition and redistribute wealth “for the common good.”

As conditions worsen, the most talented people flee society to an idyllic mountain retreat overseen by an ingenious inventor, John Galt, who wants to deprive a corrupt nation of its greatest minds and to facilitate its demise. He warns that the best thing the bureaucrats could do is “get the hell out of my way.”

Mr. Brook, of the Ayn Rand Institute, says Ms. Rand understood then, in 1957, an emerging trend toward more government influence, where “somebody’s need is a claim against our wealth.”

The problem with this, he says, is all too real.

“The last 50 years have been an orgy of placing need above wealth creation, above personal pursuit of happiness,” Mr. Brook says. “I think we are seeing the consequences of that today.”

MR. ALLISON of BB&T has the tall, lean frame, copper-colored hair and confident demeanor of many of Ms. Rand’s fictional heroes, including John Galt — a look “which would not seek forgiveness or grant it.”

He also has a résumé befitting a Rand prophet. He started at BB&T, once known as the Branch Banking and Trust Company, in 1971 and became chief executive in 1989, when the bank had $4.7 billion in assets.

By the time he retired as C.E.O. in December, he had overseen 60 bank and savings-institution acquisitions and turned BB&T into the 11th-largest bank in the nation, with $152 billion in assets, according to the bank.

A 60-year-old who speaks in a rapid-fire Southern accent, Mr. Allison says the current financial crisis is primarily the government’s fault. He criticizes the Fed as trying to manipulate normal business cycles and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as facilitating mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them.

The government’s remedies have made matters only worse, he says: “Almost everything that has been done since this crisis started is going to reduce our long-term standard of living.”

Mr. Allison says the government forced BB&T and some other healthy banks to accept TARP money to obscure that they were simply trying to save several large banks like Citigroup.

“Everyone thinks we got some kind of subsidy,” he says, noting that his company paid the money back in June, with interest. “It’s going to cost us about $250 million for money we didn’t want.”

He suggests that government get out of the way and let businesses start making money again. An example of how to make money? Look no further than BB&T, which, he says, has a proven formula for success that centers on “an uncompromising commitment to reason.”

Under Mr. Allison, new executives were handed a copy of “Atlas Shrugged.” All employees get a 30-page pamphlet describing BB&T’s philosophy and values: reason, independent thinking and decisions based on facts.

“Wishing something is so does not make it so,” Mr. Allison says. “I guarantee that long before the rest of us knew, those geniuses at Lehman Brothers knew that something was wrong, but they evaded it.”

Mr. Allison was introduced to Ms. Rand’s work in college, when he read her book “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.” He describes egalitarianism as the “most destructive principle in our society” and believes that the best employees should receive the most rewards.

“It’s not true that everybody is equal,” he says. “A lot of business people don’t want to deal with nonperformance.”

Mr. Allison cites two examples in which the bank’s philosophy guided its real-world decisions.

After the Supreme Court upheld the right of local governments in 2005 to condemn private property and hand it to someone else for commercial development, he says, BB&T refused to make loans to developers who obtained property that way.

He also says BB&T decided not to offer the controversial “pick a payment” mortgages that got so many of its competitors into trouble. Such loans, also known as “option A.R.M.’s” or “negative amortization loans,” allow borrowers to make payments that don’t even cover the interest on the loans, which causes the amount they owe to grow.

“While we did not foresee the decline in the real estate market, we knew home prices would not continue to appreciate at 15 percent per year forever,” he says, adding that his bank knew that pick-a-payment loans would be trouble for many homeowners.

“We believe Rand’s concept of the ‘trader principle,’ where life is about trading value for value, where both parties benefit from the transaction,” he says.

MR. ALLISON says that only a small fraction of the bank’s employees are objectivists. Among the many who are not is his successor as chief executive, Kelly S. King.

Bob Denham, a bank spokesman, says that “most employees don’t equate our values as being tied to John’s objectivist philosophy,” adding that “they just think of them as practical values, which they are.”

Christopher Marinac, an analyst at the research firm Fig Partners, says the culture at BB&T is definitely different from that of most other banks, attracting employees who “have their heart and soul in their job.”

He recalled attending his first analysts’ meeting at the bank a decade ago and being surprised when Mr. Allison launched into an hour-and-a-half lecture on philosophy.

“I think those of us who are a little more open-minded got something out of it,” Mr. Marinac says. “Their employees drink the Kool-Aid. If they don’t drink the Kool-Aid, they don’t work at the bank.”

Although BB&T has had problems during the financial crisis, it has outperformed its peers and remained profitable. After the government stress-tested major banks’ balance sheets in May, BB&T wasn’t required to raise additional capital.

“The philosophy has clearly been a competitive advantage,” Mr. Allison says.

Besides making speeches, Mr. Allison is also trying to spread Ms. Rand’s ideas to the nation’s colleges and universities. BB&T spends about $5 million a year to finance teaching positions and research on “the moral foundations of capitalism.”

Mr. Allison, who is now teaching at Wake Forest University, says the money isn’t specifically slated for objectivism but rather to support the work of “free-market professors, especially those that have a serious interest in Rand’s philosophy.”

Despite the current bleak state of capitalism, he’s also optimistic about the future.

“In some ways, Ayn Rand filled in the ideas of Aristotle. It’s a whopping competitive advantage,” he says. “I personally believe objectivism will be the dominant philosophy in this country in 25 years.”
21 2009-08-02 But senior White House officials remain so concerned about the risks of unintended harm to civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure in an attack on computer networks that they decline any official comment on the topic. And senior Defense Department officials and military officers directly involved in planning for the Pentagon’s new “cybercommand” acknowledge that the risk of collateral damage is one of their chief concerns.

“We are deeply concerned about the second- and third-order effects of certain types of computer network operations, as well as about laws of war that require attacks be proportional to the threat,” said one senior officer.

This officer, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the work, also acknowledged that these concerns had restrained the military from carrying out a number of proposed missions. “In some ways, we are self-deterred today because we really haven’t answered that yet in the world of cyber,” the officer said.

In interviews over recent weeks, a number of current and retired White House officials, Pentagon civilians and military officers disclosed details of classified missions — some only considered and some put into action — that illustrate why this issue is so difficult.

Although the digital attack on Iraq’s financial system was not carried out, the American military and its partners in the intelligence agencies did receive approval to cripple Iraq’s military and government communications systems in the early hours of the war in 2003. And that attack did produce collateral damage.

Besides blowing up cellphone towers and communications grids, the offensive included electronic jamming and digital attacks against Iraq’s telephone networks. American officials also contacted international communications companies that provided satellite phone and cellphone coverage to Iraq to alert them to possible jamming and to ask their assistance in turning off certain channels.

Officials now acknowledge that the communications offensive temporarily disrupted telephone service in countries around Iraq that shared its cellphone and satellite telephone systems. That limited damage was deemed acceptable by the Bush administration.

Another such event took place in the late 1990s, according to a former military researcher. The American military attacked a Serbian telecommunications network and accidentally affected the Intelsat satellite communications system, whose service was hampered for several days.

These missions, which remain highly classified, are being scrutinized today as the Obama administration and the Pentagon move into new arenas of cyberoperations. Few details have been reported previously; mention of the proposal for a digital offensive against Iraq’s financial and banking systems appeared with little notice on , a news Web site, in 2003.

The government concerns evoke those at the dawn of the nuclear era, when questions of military effectiveness, legality and morality were raised about radiation spreading to civilians far beyond any zone of combat.

“If you don’t know the consequences of a counterstrike against innocent third parties, it makes it very difficult to authorize one,” said James Lewis, a cyberwarfare specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But some military strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners.

“Policy makers are tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons, but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic” — conventional — “weapons,” said John Arquilla, an expert in military strategy at the Naval Postgraduate School in , Calif. “The cyberwarriors are held back by extremely restrictive rules of engagement.”

Despite analogies that have been drawn between biological weapons and cyberweapons, Mr. Arquilla argues that “cyberweapons are disruptive and not destructive.”

That view is challenged by some legal and technical experts.

“It’s virtually certain that there will be unintended consequences,” said Herbert Lin, a senior scientist at the and author of a recent report on offensive cyberwarfare. “If you don’t know what a computer you attack is doing, you could do something bad.”

Mark Seiden, a Silicon Valley computer security specialist who was a co-author of the National Research Council report, said, “The chances are very high that you will inevitably hit civilian targets — the worst-case scenario is taking out a hospital which is sharing a network with some other agency.”

And while such attacks are unlikely to leave craters, electronic attacks on communications networks and data centers could have broader, life-threatening consequences where power grids and critical infrastructure like water treatment plants are increasingly controlled by computer networks.

Over the centuries, rules governing combat have been drawn together in customary practice as well as official legal documents, like the and the Charter. These laws govern when it is legitimate to go to war, and set rules for how any conflict may be waged.

Two traditional military limits now are being applied to cyberwar: proportionality, which is a rule that, in layman’s terms, argues that if you slap me, I cannot blow up your house; and collateral damage, which requires militaries to limit civilian deaths and injuries.

“Cyberwar is problematic from the point of view of the laws of war,” said , a professor at Law School. “The U.N. Charter basically says that a nation cannot use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other nation. But what kinds of cyberattacks count as force is a hard question, because force is not clearly defined.”
22 2009-08-02 Emily Margaret Mary Bohan and John Banning Hyland were married Saturday at Ochre Court Chapel of Salve Regina University in Newport, R.I. The Very Rev. John F. O’Connor, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated.

Mrs. Hyland, 25, is to begin teaching the third grade at St. Bernard’s School in New York next month. She graduated from Georgetown and is in her third year of study for a dual master’s, in literacy and general education, at Bank Street College.

She is a daughter of Susan Stinchfield Bohan and Paul John Bohan of New York. Her father retired as a managing director in the bonds department at Salomon Brothers in New York. Her mother is an associate broker at Brown Harris Stevens, the New York real estate brokerage.

Mr. Hyland, 27, is a stock broker for institutional clients at the investment banking division of Barclays, the British bank. He graduated from Washington and Lee University.

He is the son of Denise M. Hyland and John J. Hyland of Garden City, N.Y. His mother retired as an elementary school teacher at the Green Vale School in Glen Head, N.Y. His father is a partner in the Cleveland law firm Jones Day. He works in the firm’s New York office.

The couple met as teenagers and students at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn.
23 2009-08-02 Those protests have infuriated the country’s ruling ayatollahs, and Basij militiamen roam the streets in force in an effort to snuff out the chanting wherever it crops up.

Although the trial was expected, its scale took many Iranians by surprise, coming days after the government said there would be only 20 defendants.

As the trial started, just after 9 a.m., prosecutors named a long and wide-ranging list of conspirators, including the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi and the Stanford historian Abbas Milani, and echoed the Iranian government’s longstanding claims that its internal critics are pawns of an international plot to undermine the Islamic republic through human rights groups and even terrorists. There was no indication that the authorities intended to arrest Mr. Moussavi or any others not yet charged, but prosecutors accused him of drawing crucial support from enemies of the state in Iran and abroad.

The only media organization allowed to cover the trial was the semiofficial Fars news agency, which has links to the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. That, in combination with recent revelations about the Guards’ central role in holding detained protesters, bolstered a widespread view that the Guards were aggressively leading the effort to put down the opposition movement. Some have taken Mr. Ahmadinejad’s dismissal last week of his intelligence minister, who had objected to the broadcasting of confessions by detainees, as yet another sign of the Guards’ control.

On Saturday, prosecutors highlighted what they called a confession by Muhammad Ali Abtahi, a cleric who served as vice president under the reformist government of Mohammad Khatami. Mr. Abtahi, one of Iran’s most widely read bloggers, was arrested shortly after the election, and word later emerged that he had appeared in a tearful videotaped confession. Such confessions, which have frequently been used before, are almost always obtained under duress, according to human rights groups and the defendants themselves.

“I believe the reformists had prepared for two or three years for this election, in order to limit the powers of the supreme leader,” Mr. Abtahi said, according to a Fars transcript. “I want to tell all friends that there was no fraud in the election, it was just a lie to build the protests around.”

In his confession, Mr. Abtahi began by praising the high election turnout. Later in the confession, he said the three leading opposition figures — Mr. Moussavi, Mr. Khatami and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani — “promised to always back each other up” in distorting the election results.

Mr. Rafsanjani, a powerful insider who has shown support for the opposition, harshly criticized the trial on Saturday, saying that “the obtaining of confessions from those who have recently been imprisoned,” which formed the basis of the indictment, had thrown the basis of the country’s entire government into question, according to a statement posted on the semiofficial Mehr news agency.

In photographs, Mr. Abtahi could be seen sitting in a gray prison uniform in the front row at the trial clutching a white piece of paper, his cleric’s turban gone and his face a grim mask. Seated near him was Muhammad Atrianfar, a prominent journalist who served as deputy interior minister.

There were other former high-ranking officials in the dock as well, including a former deputy Parliament speaker, Behzad Nabavi, and a former deputy economy minister, Mohsen Safai-Farahani. Also on trial was an Iranian-American scholar, Kian Tajbakhsh, who was seized last month by the police.

The deputy prosecutor in Tehran, Abdolreza Mohebati, also referred to what he called incriminating remarks by Maziar Bahari, a journalist who works for Newsweek, suggesting that there was a “policy of the Western media” to say the trial was rigged before it even took place. Later, Mr. Bahari was brought out to speak to journalists on the sidelines of the trial, where he delivered a short, chilling lecture on the media’s alleged role in fomenting a “velvet revolution.” He then asked forgiveness from the Iranian people and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Some senior government officials touted Mr. Abtahi’s confession as proof of the opposition’s malign intent. But the confession, which was disjointed and at times almost incoherent, seemed to be a kind of compromise with what his interrogators wanted him to say. At one point, Mr. Abtahi is quoted as saying, “I think there was the capacity for what the deputy prosecutor called a ‘velvet revolution,’ but I don’t know if the intention was there or not.”

Like the prosecutors’ opening statement, the six-part indictment was wide-ranging but focused heavily on the role of the media, suggesting repeatedly that acts as simple as taking pictures of protests should be seen as criminal acts aimed at subverting the Islamic republic and its supreme leader. Its claims were based largely on the alleged confessions of Mr. Abtahi and others, and on the testimony of an unnamed alleged spy.

The indictment did not identify specific charges, but in past trials the government accused defendants of “acting against national security,” which can carry the death penalty. In earlier cases, reformists were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, which often were significantly reduced by appeals courts.

Omid Memarian, an Iran consultant at Human Rights Watch who was jailed in 2004 on accusations of jeopardizing national security, said the government now wants to justify its use of violence in putting down the demonstrations.

“It is part of their effort to say the results were not rigged,” he said. “But it will backlash against them like other efforts.”
24 2009-08-02 AS I studied the menu recently at Barca Restaurant/Wine Bar in Danbury, a long-forgotten saying suddenly surfaced: “Life is short. Eat dessert first.” I had eaten at Barca once before, and a heavenly sphere called chocolate velvet, a ball of smooth deep dark chocolate wrapped in an intensely chocolate coverlet, lingered in my memory.

But it wasn’t the dessert menu that had drawn me back to Barca. It was the moderate prices, representing quite good value for Fairfield County. A number of entree choices are under $25, and even the steaks — $28 for a New York cut, $30 for an excellent filet mignon — are within reason.

“Barca” means small boat in Albania (the native country of Tony Ramadani, the owner), and half the menu features seafood in one form or another. But the décor is anything but nautical. A mural of the meatpacking district in Manhattan dominates the larger of two urban-smart dining areas — reflecting, perhaps, the restaurant’s eclectic menu: part Italian, part Continental, with a touch of Asia and the Caribbean spliced in.

Deviations from its pasta and veal strong suits produced mixed results. One successful dish was more Japanese than Italian. It starred sesame-crusted tuna slices — called pan-seared rare, but really sushi raw, which was fine by me — served with wasabi, pickled ginger and delicious green tea soba noodles. Another hit had a Latin edge: crunchy-edged Maryland crab cake with a tingly mango salsa.

At the same meal we also had roasted maple-glazed salmon with basmati rice and spinach and, as a starter, tuna tartare. The salmon was perfectly roasted — ever so lightly — but the maple glaze was a syrupy mistake. Good, well-cooked salmon doesn’t need any sugarcoating. As for the tuna tartare, it lacked the sparkling freshness the dish requires; helpings of pickled ginger and wasabi mayonnaise did not compensate enough.
25 2009-08-02 IF money and fame are the yardsticks, Annie Leibovitz is one of the most successful photographers of all time. She has a seven-figure salary from Vanity Fair and commands tens of thousands of dollars a day from commercial clients like Louis Vuitton. Her latest book, “At Work,” made best-seller lists, and an exhibition of her classic images  Demi Moore naked and pregnant, Mikhail Baryshnikov on the beach  has been touring the world for over two years.

So as the news has spread in recent months that Ms. Leibovitz is facing extraordinary financial troubles, with the possibility of losing her Civil War-era town houses in Greenwich Village, a home in upstate New York and the rights to decades of her work, many have formulated the same questions: How is this possible? How could an artist of her standing be in such financial straits? If Annie Leibovitz can’t make it in New York, who can?

On July 29, Ms. Leibovitz was sued in State Supreme Court for nonpayment by a company that had lent her $24 million, and which demanded access to her homes so it could begin the process of selling them to satisfy her debt. Ms. Leibovitz had taken out the loan last year, pledging as collateral properties in Greenwich Village and in Rhinebeck, N.Y., her negatives and the rights to her photographs. The lender, Art Capital Group, claims Ms. Leibovitz is behind on hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid fees associated with the loans.

The photographer, 59, declined to comment. Friends and colleagues said that despite her many successes, Ms. Leibovitz has been shadowed by a long history of less than careful financial dealings. Public records show that in the last two years, Ms. Leibovitz has faced tax liens of $1.4 million and two lawsuits claiming that she has not paid more than $700,000 in bills for photography services.

“The mind that can take these extraordinary pictures is not necessarily the same mind that is a perfect money manager,” said Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair.

A recent series of personal issues has made navigating her already complex life more difficult, close associates said. In the last five years, Ms. Leibovitz lost her father, her mother and her companion, Susan Sontag; added two children to her family and oversaw the costly and controversial renovation of three properties in Greenwich Village.

Charlie Scheips, the former director of the Condé Nast photo archive who helped Ms. Leibovitz make a deal last year with an auction house to sell prints of her photographs, said that when he spoke to her recently, he was told: “I’m really under the gun. I’ve got three daughters, I lost my spouse. I’ve got too many jobs to do and it’s chaos.”

Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman for Ms. Leibovitz, pointed a finger at the lender suing Ms. Leibovitz, Art Capital Group, a company in New York with a history of litigation over its boutique loans to artists, art dealers and collectors, who pledge their art works as collateral. “Annie is in the same shoes as many other people involved with Art Capital,” Mr. Hiltzik said.

The firm, with offices in a former Sotheby’s building on Madison Avenue, has been compared to a high-end pawn shop, and it has sued and been sued by a litany of clients and associates, including Julian Schnabel, its former lawyers and ex-employees.

But all that would presumably have been known to Ms. Leibovitz before she turned to Art Capital in 2008 for a $22 million line of credit, which was later increased to $24 million. The full amount, plus interest and fees, is due Sept. 8, according to the lawsuit.

The question is why she found herself needing that much cash. Mr. Hiltzik said his client had no comment.

Friends and colleagues agree that it is not a taste for luxuries that has caused Ms. Leibovitz’s financial difficulties. Although well known for extravagant spending while on assignment, those expenses are paid by her employers.

“Annie is not an expensive liver herself,” said Tina Brown, who edited Vanity Fair from 1984 to 1992, where Ms. Leibovitz began working after her early years at Rolling Stone magazine. “She hangs out with her kids. She doesn’t hang out in the lights at the parties.”

In the 1970s, Ms. Leibovitz flew around the world chronicling rock ’n’ roll during its hedonistic heyday and accompanying hard-partying reporters like Hunter S. Thompson. She was notoriously bad with her expenses and was also known to give away expensive Minox cameras to anyone who said they admired hers.

In “Life Through a Lens,” a documentary about Ms. Leibovitz directed by her sister Barbara Leibovitz, Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone, said that he thought her move to Vanity Fair in 1983 might be good for her because she was at her “peak drug use and was so irresponsible, was leaving rental cars everywhere and not turning things in on time.”

Over the years at Vanity Fair, her shoots became more complex and expensive, often elaborate as movie shoots. “Month after month, it got a little bit more complicated with every shoot,” Jane Sarkin, a Vanity Fair features editor, said in the documentary. “Her demands became bigger. Fire, rain, cars airplanes, circus animals  whatever she wanted she got.”

As Ms. Leibovitz became more famous and successful  she was hired by American Express, Gap and the Milk Board for prominent advertising campaigns her business and personal life became more complicated.
26 2009-08-02 Dan Cunningham, 44, a Red-Sox-to-pinstripes convert, has been grooming the Yankees’ baseball field for 21 years. Yes, this may qualify for some sort of longevity award inside the tumultuous, “You’re hired, you’re fired, now clean out your locker” Steinbrenner cosmos. Mr. Cunningham lives in a Hell’s Kitchen walk-up with his yellow lab, Scout; they spend days off at his home in South Kingstown, R.I. ROBIN FINN

UP BEFORE SUNRISE I wake up around 4:30 so I have time to give the dog a quick walk and leave the house by 5. I’d prefer not to be an early bird, but when you have to be at the ballpark by 6, that’s life. I stop for coffee, then I take the C or the A to the D to my final destination: 161 in the South Bronx. Yeah, there’s nothing like going to work at the crack of dawn.

CAFFEINATION Assuming we have a 1 p.m. Sunday game and the weather is cooperating, first thing I do at the ballpark is get a cup of coffee. If it rained overnight and we didn’t cover the field, we’re in a lot of trouble. Otherwise, we start getting the field ready for 10:30 batting practice; put up the protective nets and screens. We don’t wear uniforms, but we do wear sponsor attire: this season it’s Nike and Tommy Bahama.

FIELD OF DREAMS Besides mowing the bluegrass to 1 1/4 inches and hand-watering the infield, there’s a lot of cleaning up, because with ballplayers, there’s a lot of spitting out. Mainly sunflower seeds and gum. Not many guys use tobacco or snuff products anymore. In the new ballpark, I’ve noticed less stuff thrown onto the field from the stands; could be the economy. Nothing’s disposable. Just kidding.

BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS Around 7:30 we take a coffee break; sometimes McDonald’s, but usually we go to the visitors’ clubhouse and have whatever’s cooking. If I eat, it’s a bacon sandwich.

GAME TIME After batting practice, we remove all the netting, work on the mounds, which means repacking and leveling the clay, put the bases out, make sure the baselines are pliable but not slick. There’s a fine line. You get it all consistent and then you hope Mother Nature doesn’t have other ideas. We change the bases and drag the infield every third inning.
27 2009-08-02 ROB a bank, and if the federal government doesn’t catch you in five years, you’re off the hook. But a hairstylist and sometime songwriter from Brooklyn recently discovered that there is no statute of limitations when it comes to challenging the rights of rent-controlled tenants.

The stylist, Robert Nocco, found out that his landlord could legally reach back more than 25 years to question his right to live in the apartment, even though he has proof that he has been paying the rent for decades.

The drama unfolded over a $2 million red-brick town house in Brooklyn Heights, bought a few years ago by Dexter Guerrieri, the president of Vandenberg Real Estate. Mr. Guerrieri has made a career representing buyers and sellers of town houses, often advising his clients on the intricacies of those shared with tenants.

Even Mr. Guerrieri, however, was amazed by the twists and turns of this case.

Until June, he and his wife, Jane, rented one floor of their house to Mr. Nocco for $212 a month. Mr. Nocco’s parents had first rented the floor-through apartment half a century ago, before the neighborhood became gentrified, and Mr. Nocco, who is in his late 50s, has lived there most of his life.

Over the years, the Noccos had overcome a series of legal challenges, and at least one buyout offer, from previous owners seeking to regain control of the apartment.
28 2009-08-02 Despite the lack of participation from the big lenders, Mr. Banker says there will be plenty of loan options available, and they will be safer than in the past.

He says members must submit to audits and ongoing monitoring by his staff to ensure they abide by the organization’s rules. Among the rules is one requiring that borrowers first be considered for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. If they don’t qualify for those loans, others could be offered, but there must be “clear, verifiable benefits for the applicants,” Mr. Banker said.

Offering adjustable-rate mortgages — which could, for instance, raise monthly payments to more than 45 percent of a borrower’s monthly income — would raise a flag.

If after an audit the collaborative found that a lender had shown a pattern of offering those riskier loans to borrowers who could qualify for less expensive products, Mr. Banker said the lender would most likely be ousted from the organization.

“The goal,” he said, “is to not allow another wave of cheap money to drive consumers into the ground.”

Brad Strothkamp, an analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., said the collaborative would probably help borrowers. “The concept is great,” he said. “If this organization can help point consumers in the direction of lenders who have their best interests at heart, that is not only something consumers would get behind, but also the government.”

Mr. Strothkamp said he would be wary if, for instance, the collaborative’s members banned interest-only loans. “They are actually decent products when the consumer is properly educated and responsible,” he said.

Mr. Banker said interest-only mortgages were not barred. But stated-income mortgages, for which prospective borrowers need not document income, will be barred even though such loans could benefit a small subset.

Lenders have generally stopped offering these loans, but Mr. Banker says there is a chance of their once again coming into vogue as the crisis ends and lending standards loosen.

Jeff Lazerson, the chief executive of Mortgage Grader, said his company had pledged to work on the borrower’s behalf since its inception last year. But before the collaborative, “there’s been nothing in the mortgage world that provided consumers with a way to know that these people are safe to deal with,” he said.

“So the first question out of a borrower’s mouth should be ‘Are you certified — and if not, why not?’ ”
29 2009-08-02 An economic downturn is often seen by businesses as an opportunity to make controversial decisions that would be unpalatable under ordinary conditions. I very much appreciated that your article implicitly questioned the motives of the New York City Ballet’s decision to lay off those dancers.

It is indeed difficult to believe that they were fired for economic reasons, and I think the City Ballet should be a little more respectful to and honest with ticket buyers and subscribers. That’s no way to run a world-class company, if you ask me.
30 2009-08-02 Economists have long recognized the attractions of flexible working arrangements to some segments of the labor force. But Moreton also offers more novel observations about the lure of Wal-Mart. She explains, for example, how the company invoked the fundamentalist Christian teachings embraced by many of its employees to fashion a working environment that induced them to work contentedly for low wages and paltry benefits.

Sam Walton was not a fundamentalist Christian. He and his wife, Helen, worshipped at a liberal branch of the Presbyterian Church, and Mrs. Walton was even an early abortion rights advocate. But Moreton argues that Walton and his fellow executives quickly recognized the economic advantage of weaving specific strands of the Ozark region’s fundamentalist belief system into their corporate strategy.

At the heart of that strategy was the company’s emphasis on the Christian concept of “servant leadership.” In other parts of the retail sector, the servitude demanded of retail clerks was typically experienced as demeaning. But by repeatedly reminding employees that the Christian servant leader cherishes opportunities to provide cheerful service to others, Moreton argues, Wal-Mart transformed servitude from a negative job characteristic into a positive one.

Another cultural strand in Moreton’s account is the company’s policy of reproducing the social relationships characteristic of fundamentalist Christian households in the workplace. To this end, Wal-Mart needed a legal pretext for hiring mostly men as managers and mostly women as clerks. The solution was to move managers to new store locations frequently, a condition of employment that men would generally accept but most women would not.

But even though the managerial jobs paid better and offered more opportunities for promotion, there was still a problem for male employees. The highly regimented, rule-driven jobs at Wal-Mart were a pale substitute for the independent farmer’s role from which the company’s Ozark male managers had recently been driven. Rather than cede greater control to managers, Moreton argues, the company salved the egos of the men by celebrating a patriarchal ideal of “Christian manliness.” The women, for their part, were only too happy to adopt the prescribed submissive role.

While Moreton’s book answers important questions about why workers have been willing to accept Wal-Mart’s austere compensation package, Lichtenstein’s sheds valuable light on the technological reasons for the company’s success. His detailed account of the company’s early prowess in exploiting bar-code scanning and satellite technology helps explain how Wal-Mart revolutionized the way distribution channels are organized.

ichtenstein, a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, also provides a detailed look at the dark side of the company’s employment practices. From its ruthless efforts at union-busting to its determination to overcome basic safety and hours regulation to its widespread employment of sweatshop subcontractors in China, Wal-Mart has consistently maintained that no one has the right to limit the corporation’s freedom to act as it pleases.

The recent market meltdown, however, has led to increased skepticism about the efficacy of Adam Smith’s invisible hand. And the more we learn, the clearer it becomes that market outcomes are often far from perfect. Smith’s theories are especially likely to break down when the goals people are trying to achieve depend, in varying degrees, on the amounts they spend relative to others.

Most parents, for example, want to send their children to a good school, but a good school is a relative concept. Only half of all schools at any moment can be in the top half. Because there is a strong link between house prices in a neighborhood and the quality of its schools, people cannot send their children to good schools if they spend less than others on housing. Families thus feel pressure to take whatever steps they can to buy a house in a good school district.

One option is to work longer hours. Another is to accept a job that entails greater safety risks. But if everyone works longer hours or accepts greater risks to buy houses in the better school districts, the only effect is to bid up the prices of those houses. As in the familiar sports stadium metaphor, all stand to get a better view simply to discover that no one ends up seeing any better.

That’s why we have labor regulations. And as Lichtenstein argues, Wal-Mart may have done more than any other American institution to undermine those regulations. Sam Walton and his successors were no doubt driven by a sincere belief in the magic of the invisible hand. But their sincerity has done nothing to mitigate the damage they’ve caused.

47 2009-08-03 Wie sufficiently impressed Beth Daniel, the captain of the United States Solheim Cup team, that she was picked for the team as a wild card. The Cup, a competition against Europe, will be held Aug. 17-23 outside Chicago.

Daniel also picked Juli Inkster, who will make her eighth Solheim Cup appearance.

Matthew birdied from 18 feet at 13 and from 40 feet at 14. She also made a birdie at the long 15th.

“When I made that putt on 14, I felt it was mine for the taking,” Matthew said. “I felt I’d never have a better chance and I’d better take it. Then once I hit the good tee shot at the 18th, I felt that even I could do it from there.”

Creamer dropped two shots on the 18th after driving into a grassy bunker and then sending her third shot past the green and up against the clubhouse.

The defending champion, Jiyai Shin, never threatened in the final round, and a double bogey at the last hole left her with a 75 and a share of eighth place.

On the United States Solheim Cup Team, Wie and Inkster will join Creamer, Kerr, Kim, Angela Stanford, Nicole Castrale, Brittany Lang, Morgan Pressel, Kristy McPherson, Brittany Lincicome and Natalie Gulbis.

“I am so honored, so thrilled,” Wie said, adding that she had “been nudging” Daniel.

“I have been badgering her a bit,” Wie said. “It was one of my biggest goals this year.”

Wie, 19, became eligible for points only when she became an LPGA Tour member this year, putting her at a disadvantage since the qualifying period began after the last Solheim Cup in 2007.

Matthew is joined on the European team by Gwladys Nocera of France; Tania Elosegui of Spain; Diana Luna of Italy; Laura Davies of England; Sophie Gustafson, Helen Alfredsson, Maria Hjorth and Anna Nordqvist of Sweden; Suzann Pettersen of Norway; Becky Brewerton of Wales; and Janice Moodie of Scotland.

ALL FUNK IN SENIOR OPEN Fred Funk won the United States Senior Open by six strokes as he finished 20 under par, a tournament record. Beginning the final round 13 under, one stroke ahead of Greg Norman and Joe Sindelar, Funk shot a seven-under 65 at Crooked Stick in Carmel, Ind., breaking the tournament record of 17 under, set by Hale Irwin in 2000 in Bethlehem, Pa.

Sindelar finished at 14 under and Russ Cochran was third at 12 under. Norman struggled through the middle of his round and tied for fourth with Loren Roberts at 11 under.

HENNINGSSON WINS FIRST Oskar Henningsson of Sweden made six birdies in the final round and won the Moravia Silesia Open by two strokes, shooting 13-under 275 at Prosper Golf Resort in Celadna, Czech Republic. It was his first European Tour victory.
48 2009-08-03 Woods moved into first place in the FedEx Cup standings and padded his lead on the money list with another $918,000 after winning his third Buick Open, tying Vijay Singh’s record total. Woods also won in 2002 and 2006.

Playing for the first time since missing the cut at the British Open, Woods got off to a brutal start.

He shot a 71 in the first round and said it was probably the worst putting performance of his career. In frustration, he skipped his post-round practice session.

It only added to Woods’s legacy because he went from a tie for 95th to a victory, the largest jump he has made from the first round in a tournament he ended up winning.

“I was so far back that I was fortunate enough to put two good rounds together,” he said.

Woods roared back into contention with the best five-hole start of his career — beginning six under in the second round — en route to a nine-under-par 63 for his best score in relation to par in four years.

He hit the ball somewhat poorly in the third round, but made enough clutch shots to finish with a 65 and a one-shot lead going into the final round Sunday.

Without much of a sweat, he avoided losing a lead after 54 holes for the first time since 1996, and improved to 47-3 when he at least shares the lead after three rounds.

Thatcher shot a nine under Sunday and shared the lead briefly, but he expected Woods to pull away with 15 holes left on the vulnerable Warwick Hills.

Woods, whose previous three wins this year were each by one shot, spent much of Sunday with a two-shot cushion before he took a three-stroke lead with a birdie at No. 16. His businesslike final round included three birdies and no bogeys.

“I got fooled a few times by the wind and I hit some bad shots,” Woods said.

Early and often at Warwick Hills, from the pro-am when he played with the famed rocker Bob Seger through Sunday, Woods was thanked by fans who appreciated his appearance in an economically ravaged state at a tournament reportedly on its last leg.

“I’ve never played in front of fans like this,” Woods said.

GolfWeek Magazine reported on its Web site that General Motors would end its 51-year run with the Buick Open, the PGA Tour’s longest partnership, and The Associated Press confirmed the report with a person briefed on the decision. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement would not be made until after the tournament. GolfWeek also reported that Greenbrier in West Virginia was waiting for the PGA Tour to confirm that it would replace the Buick Open in 2010.

Woods said he thought about his walk up the 18th fairway at Warwick Hills as being his last.

“Hopefully, we get to come back to this area,” he said.
49 2009-08-03 But even fiscal watchdogs, who generally fault overtime as evidence of poor management, say they can understand the city’s penchant for it because spending on overtime may make more economic sense than filling new positions.

While this is not true for the ticket-writing force, which has grown dramatically to reach a head count of 2,332 this summer, up from 1,559 in 2002, in other departments overtime may be used to compensate for a depleted staff. “It can be less costly to have municipal employees work overtime rather than hiring and having to pay not only salaries but fringe benefits for things such as pensions and health insurance, the cost of which have been growing exponentially,” said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city’s Independent Budget Office.

Traffic agents, who work for the Police Department, are among the lowest paid of the city’s enforcement personnel, and that, according to the agents’ union, may explain the desire of some agents to log large quantities of overtime.

“From our standpoint, we can’t get enough overtime,” said James Huntley, president of CWA Local 1182, which represents traffic and sanitation workers. “It’s like having a second job. The overtime is something we appreciate.”

After putting in a 40-hour workweek, ticket agents, whose annual starting salary is $27,013, can earn time and a half in overtime pay, Mr. Huntley said.

“You have to ask N.Y.P.D. permission to work a second job,” Mr. Huntley said. “Why do that when you can ask for overtime?”

The Police Department points out that agents are not required to perform overtime.

“It’s not mandated by the department,” said Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman. “But as these are relatively low-paid jobs, we don’t have any shortage of volunteers.”

Mr. Browne also noted that when construction sites disrupt street traffic and force the department to provide parking and traffic enforcement, builders reimburse the city for the cost of the overtime.

Labor experts observe that overtime is common among the uniformed services like police and fire, which must provide 24-hour coverage. New York City firefighters are even guaranteed 96 hours of overtime each year in their contract.

The problem with relying on overtime, said Carol Kellerman, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group that monitors city spending, is that it “becomes perceived as part of the salary.”

“It can turn into a de facto raise,” she said. “Then you are not really disclosing the true salary of the job. You’re not really telling the public what work force is needed to do the job and what it is being paid.”

Although there are now more ticket writers than there have been at any other time this decade, there still seems to be plenty of overtime to go around — and Mr. Huntley said he hears few complaints about it at union meetings.

“The majority of people, they look for it,” he said. “They want to do more for their apartment, for their home, for their children. And if you take it from them, they might cry, some of them.”
50 2009-08-03 Until recently, few religious or government officials took notice. But an accrual of painful scenes has convinced some of the need for intervention.

“There isn’t a week that goes by that we don’t have problems with this,” said Richard Fishman, director of the New York State Division of Cemeteries, charged with regulating burial plots. “A person dies, and they can’t get buried because there is no one left to sign the papers, or the guy in charge is 99 years old and in a nursing home.”

There are no exact figures, but officials like Mr. Fishman and leaders of Jewish organizations estimate that while 20,000 or more burial societies once flourished in the Northeast, managing plots in hundreds of Jewish cemeteries, all but a few thousand are defunct.

By tradition, Jews must be buried within 24 hours of death. If the deceased is a member of a burial society or a descendant of members, relatives are supposed to contact an officer of the society, who verifies the person’s membership and signs a permit allowing the cemetery to open the assigned plot.

But Mrs. Marmor, 76, said that when she asked the cemetery director what happened to her plot, he told her it had been sold by the president of the burial society, who had since died.

“They couldn’t do anything more for me,” she said. After much stress, and with help from a lawyer, she ended up restarting the defunct association, the Trembowla Sisters Burial Society, and discovered to her relief that the plot on the other side of her husband was available.

Some burial society officers are reluctant — and not always reliable — inheritors of the job.

Sam Falk took over the Friends of Zion of Harlem Burial Society after his mother, for many years the society’s acting president, entered an assisted-living residence on Long Island a few years ago. He shipped the society’s file cabinets and cemetery maps to his home in Southern California.

“I tried to send out the notices and keep up,” said Mr. Falk, 59, whose grandfather founded the society in 1911, “but to be honest, in the last few years, I didn’t have the time.”

He was rescued by a tiny agency of the New York State Insurance Department known as the Office of Miscellaneous Estates. Tucked into a cluttered corner of the state’s Liquidation Bureau in Lower Manhattan, Miscellaneous Estates is where burial societies go to die. The agency took the burial society off Mr. Falk’s hands after an elderly woman — worried that he would not be able to provide her a plot next to her mother in a Staten Island cemetery — found a sympathetic cemetery administrator who referred her to Miscellaneous Estates.

Robin Kraus, the agency’s manager, and her assistant, Alice Jenkins, have taken hundreds of burial societies into a sort of receivership over the past decade, collecting dues from members until the last one is buried. They move with practiced deftness through the thousands of ancient index cards, yellowing ledger books and rolled-up oilcloth cemetery maps entrusted to their care.

“What we do is step up and perform all the functions of a burial society until all the people entitled are buried,” said Ms. Kraus, a lifelong civil servant who, as the child of Holocaust survivors, found an emotional home when she joined the bureau 15 years ago. Almost every Jewish cemetery in New York has her phone number on auto-dial.

Many family members who call are desperate and distraught, she said.

“You have to be able to deal with people who are hard of hearing, and oftentimes speak in thick accents,” she said.

Mark G. Peters, who heads the quasi-public Liquidation Bureau, which protects consumers who hold policies with failed insurance companies, said the government viewed burial societies as a type of insurer. “They may be a historically anachronistic insurance product,” he said, “but we are essentially the only safety net for people still depending on these societies.”

Mark Wittlin, 53, remembered attending meetings with his father at a burial society in Brooklyn known as the Senate Association. Members would address one another with honorifics like “noble grand brother” and solemnly discuss financial and maintenance matters while he and other children prowled the rented hall.

When he graduated from college, his father and other members asked him to become an officer, but he declined. When his father died, they asked again and he declined again.

A lawyer took over the society. When the lawyer died a few years ago, Mr. Wittlin answered the door one day to find a young man there, several large shopping bags arrayed around him, with rolled-up maps jutting out: the records of the Senate Association.

“ ‘My uncle wanted you to have these,’ he says,” Mr. Wittlin recounted. “He was the lawyer’s nephew.”

Mr. Wittlin said he tried to be a good president. But there were 60 remaining members, including some in nursing homes and some unaccounted for — though liable to pop up needing service at any time.

When someone told him about Robin Kraus, he went to see her. He took along the shopping bags. “I just don’t have the energy for this,” he told her.

She and Ms. Jenkins told him not to worry. They unpacked the records and maps, and told him they would take it from there.
51 2009-08-03 Switzerland, which is home to an impressive number of global corporations, has also come under fire from the European Union for offering too-favorable tax rules, including exemptions for income earned abroad. But what critics forget is that these practices also benefit other countries. Swiss firms alone employ hundreds of thousands of people in the United States and Germany, for example. Subsidiaries of multinational corporations usually pay income taxes where they operate, so having their headquarters in Switzerland can help companies avoid multiple taxation in high-tax countries, thereby safeguarding productive capital for investment.

Until recently, the Swiss government had steadfastly insisted on Swiss sovereignty and refused to provide assistance to other governments in cases of tax evasion — that is, cases in which a taxpayer failed to declare income, either intentionally or unintentionally. While tax fraud is considered a crime here, tax evasion is not (though it can be subject to fines).

This Swiss peculiarity of considering tax evasion as a mere administrative offense has a long history. We think government exists to serve us, not the other way around. We understand that we have to pay taxes — and we do, with numerous studies showing that the Swiss are extraordinarily honest about paying what we owe — but we do not think it is the government’s role to intrude on our privacy and wrench them from us.

This attitude goes back to Switzerland’s founding in the 13th century. The original Swiss communities’ resentment of what they saw as the Hapsburgs’ oppressive taxes helped push them to claim their independence in 1291.

Today, Swiss citizens continue to vote on any tax increases in referendums (and sometimes even accept them). These healthy curbs on government contrast with the Orwellian concept of the “transparent citizen” whose every act is known to government. We see our system as a social pact between citizens and the state.

Swiss privacy laws help preserve basic property rights. Bank secrecy was introduced in 1934, most notably to protect the identities and assets of Jews in Nazi Germany. (Unfortunately, those same rules made it difficult for some heirs to gain access to these accounts without proper documentation, leading to an out-of-court agreement in 1998 by Swiss banks to pay $1.25 billion to settle Holocaust-related lawsuits.) Corruption, expropriation, crime and the persecution of various minorities remain risks in most of the world. For people threatened by such risks, financial privacy can protect their legitimate property.

Some would argue that Swiss bank accounts offer the same protections to criminals, but in fact Swiss provisions against money laundering are tough. Swiss bankers are required to know their clients and the origin of the funds they accept. They must alert the regulators if they suspect criminal behavior.

Banking confidentiality enjoys overwhelming support in Switzerland. According to the latest annual survey by the polling firm M.I.S. Trend, 78 percent favor maintaining the laws as they are, and 91 percent are shown to value their financial privacy. This is especially relevant since Swiss citizens are expected to vote eventually on the renegotiated tax treaties in a referendum.

If the government fails to convince a majority of voters, the treaties won’t enter into force. But if they are ratified as planned, the Swiss government should agree only to an exchange of information in individual cases with reasonable suspicion of tax fraud.

Other governments should see this as a fair compromise. We will not solve the global problem of tax evasion by punishing honest depositors and destroying Swiss traditions.
52 2009-08-03 Yahoo will lose some of its most talented engineers to Microsoft and as many as 400 employees through layoffs. The deal also undercuts years of investment around search technology. By selling the technological crown jewels, the company may lose some of its high-tech credibility among employees and others in Silicon Valley, as well as among customers.

But the core of Yahoo remains intact, according to Ms. Bartz. “We haven’t eviscerated the company,” she said.

Given Yahoo’s battering by investors, Ms. Bartz lamented that Yahoo and Microsoft failed to explain the relationship better to Wall Street. She blamed herself for a comment she made several weeks ago, at an industry conference, that Microsoft would have to pay Yahoo “boatloads of cash” to win its search business. That statement, she said, helped to solidify an expectation that Yahoo would receive $1 billion or more upfront as part of the deal.

“I made a mistake. I was never interested in doing it for upfront money. That doesn’t help me operate a business,” Ms. Bartz said. She noted that such a payment would have had significant tax consequences while contributing only $3 million in annual interest to Yahoo’s bottom line.

Wall Street had become enamored with the previous, more immediately lucrative proposals between Microsoft and Yahoo. Last year, trying to improve its search business and better compete with its archrival Google, Microsoft offered $46 billion to buy all of Yahoo. Analysts estimate that the new deal — involving what many people saw as Yahoo’s most important asset — is worth only around $4 billion to $5 billion.

“It’s rather like getting a Picasso and saying, ‘You know, the canvas costs $200, the paint cost $300, so we’ll sell it to you for $500,’ ” said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “I’ve never seen investors so angry.”

Microsoft’s chief, Steven A. Ballmer, has gone to unusual lengths to defend the deal on Yahoo’s behalf. Last week, he told a group of investors gathered at Microsoft’s headquarters that it was “sort of unbelievable” that Yahoo got to keep such a high percentage of the ad sales while spending nothing on the underlying infrastructure to run the search operation.

And Ms. Bartz argues that the more generous offers came during far different economic times. In addition, she said, analysts have underestimated the two and half years it will take to integrate the two companies’ search and advertising systems. The companies also face the daunting process of getting approval from regulatory agencies that are now closely scrutinizing deals on antitrust grounds.

Ms. Bartz said that she avoided Mr. Ballmer’s immediate advances after taking the helm of Yahoo. “He called my first day,” she said. “I told him: ‘Go away. I haven’t even found the bathroom.’ ”

When Ms. Bartz finally began negotiations, Mr. Ballmer presented two options: a large upfront payment or a higher percentage of revenue tied to ads sold on Yahoo Web sites. “He wasn’t going to pay twice,” Ms. Bartz said.

Ultimately, Mr. Ballmer, who was unavailable to comment, and Ms. Bartz ended up on the phone debating minute details, like how fast things like search results and ads would appear, at one point haggling over a margin of 100 milliseconds.

Ms. Bartz also fought to play down Microsoft’s Bing brand on the Yahoo search results page, with just a bit of text instead of a logo, and she pushed Mr. Ballmer hard to make sure that Yahoo retained the right to sell its own display ads to big advertisers like Procter & Gamble and Unilever.

“I had to get Steve through the, ‘we get to sell part,’ ” she said. Meanwhile, Ms. Bartz has plenty of other work to do at Yahoo. She has picked up on the dysfunction throughout the company during her eight months on the job.

For one, Yahoo has not poured enough money into creating a top-class technology infrastructure capable of delivering a variety of services to consumers. “We are actually behind in investing,” she said. “We should have invested more.”

Ms. Bartz also complained about a lack of balance among the different product groups. Motivated employees in the company’s sports section have turned it into a must-visit Web destination by breaking news stories and providing witty commentary. Other sections have languished.

This is often a result of what Ms. Bartz sees as insufficient communication and barriers among the company’s various American and international properties over sharing videos and other content. “We had a fight for 18 months here on what a video button should look like,” Ms. Bartz said.

Spending money to fix these problems made more sense to Ms. Bartz than hemorrhaging cash in a bid to keep pace with Google and Microsoft.

Microsoft has backed its new search engine, Bing, with billions of dollars in infrastructure and marketing investments. So far, the search engine has been well received. While encouraged by some of Bing’s innovations, Ms. Bartz figures that Google will most likely match them soon. “That is the arms race I don’t want to be in,” she said.

But some investors fear that Yahoo may be trading one of the most profitable businesses of the 21st century — search — for a deflating, hypercompetitive media business that appeared to peak in the 20th century.

“I don’t think the surviving pieces are very interesting,” said Michael Lippert, manager of the Baron iOpportunity fund, which acquired Yahoo shares earlier this year on the anticipation of a lucrative search partnership. Mr. Lippert was disappointed by the terms of the deal but did not make out too badly; his fund also owns Microsoft stock, which rose slightly last week.

“Ballmer got himself a fantastic deal,” he said.
53 2009-08-03 John F. Kennedy has not been president for more than 45 years, but one of his presidential speeches has become an integral part of a marketing campaign to sell wristwatches.

A current print and television advertising campaign for the watchmaker Omega commemorating the 40th anniversary of the NASA’s Apollo mission features President Kennedy giving his “We choose to go to the Moon,” speech at Rice University in 1962, a year before his assassination and seven years before the Moon landing.

The campaign highlights the Omega Speedmaster, the model approved by NASA in the 1960s as durable enough for space travel. It was supplied to astronauts, as “the first and only watch worn on the moon,” the text of the ads proclaim.

Rachel Day, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit group that runs the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and retains rights to many of Mr. Kennedy’s images, said the group had granted permission to use his likeness in the ads, but declined to discuss what, if anything, Omega paid.

Ms. Day was unaware of any prior sanctioned use of Mr. Kennedy’s image for commercial purposes. The Omega ads show the Web site of the library, which is currently holding an exhibit on the Moon landing.

Omega, a subsidiary of the Swatch Group based in Switzerland, did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The watchmaker’s association with Mr. Kennedy began serendipitously. In 1960, a friend and political donor, Grant Stockdale, gave the then-senator an Omega Ultra Thin model, with the optimistic inscription “President of the United States John F. Kennedy from his friend Grant.” The watch could be seen in a photograph of Mr. Kennedy’s inauguration published in Life magazine. In 2005, Omega bought the watch for $350,000 at auction, and it is now in the Omega Museum in Biel, Switzerland.
54 2009-08-03 An alleged confession by Mr. Abtahi was at the core of the accusations leveled by prosecutors on Saturday, in which they took aim at virtually every figure associated with reform in Iran, and many others abroad.

Mr. Abtahi was quoted as saying that the opposition’s claims of a stolen election were false, and that opposition leaders had conspired in advance to misrepresent the vote. Such confessions are almost always obtained under duress, according to human rights groups.

Although Mir Hussein Moussavi and other opposition leaders have not been arrested, the state news agency published statements with hard-line lawmakers Sunday hinting that this was the next step.

“Today’s confession has opened the way to dealing with the leaders of the unrest,” said one lawmaker, Hamid Resaee, according to IRNA, the state news agency. “There is no longer any reason to tolerate or compromise.”

Another hard-line figure, the cleric Elias Naderan, was quoted as saying: “Those within the inner circle who managed the unrest must be put on trial. We shouldn’t chase after weak, second-class figures with no influence.”

A separate trial began Sunday for 10 additional people arrested after the disputed presidential election, Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news service reported, citing a judiciary official.

The government’s newly combative stance seemed to set the stage for a test of wills with the opposition, which continues to muster street demonstrations.

On Sunday, opposition leaders denounced the mass trial as illegitimate, though they commented before Mr. Mortazavi warned about possible prosecutions.

Mohammad Khatami, the former president, called the trial an “unconstitutional” act that would do profound damage to public trust in Iran’s system of government. He also said he believed the trial had been carried out against the will of Iran’s judiciary chief, Iran’s state-run Press TV reported.

In recent days, Mr. Khatami and other officials have said the judiciary had not had access to the hundreds of people who remained in detention after being arrested in the unrest after the election.

Although Mr. Mortazavi is technically in charge of the court that is handling the mass trial, many Iranians believe the broader effort to tame Iran’s opposition movement is being run by the Revolutionary Guards.

Mr. Moussavi said those responsible for the trial “are disgracing the political establishment,” according to a statement on his Web site.

Members of the defendants’ families gathered Saturday at Mr. Abtahi’s home in Tehran and issued a statement denouncing his confession, the reformist newspaper Etemad Melli reported.

“Not only do we not accept the confession, we also know that Abtahi said these things due to a long period of imprisonment for the purpose of obtaining a confession,” the statement said.

Mr. Abtahi’s wife, Fahimeh Mousavinejad, dismissed her husband’s confession as false in a court hearing on Saturday, Etemad Melli reported.

“The things he was saying and the parts of it published in Fars news were not at all in Mr. Abtahi’s style,” she said, referring to the Fars news agency. “As his family, we know the way he expresses himself. Many people have read his blog. The sentences he was using were not his own.”
55 2009-08-03 BANGKOK — Soon after coming to power four months ago, Najib Razak, the Malaysian prime minister, vowed to temper the country’s repressive laws and respect civil liberties though they have often been ignored.

But Malaysia’s honeymoon of liberalism hit the rocks over the weekend, when the police broke up a large rally in Kuala Lumpur, arresting nearly 600 people and reaffirming the governing party’s longstanding policy of zero tolerance toward street protests.

Opposition parties, which organized the rally, were calling for the repeal of a law that allows the government to jail its critics indefinitely without charge. The opposition is also pressing the government to expand an inquiry into the recent death under mysterious circumstances of a political aide after a late-night interrogation by anticorruption officials.

News services estimated that the rally on Saturday, which was broken up by thousands of police officers using tear gas and water cannons, drew about 20,000 protesters, making it the largest demonstration in two years.

“We can provide them stadiums where they can shout themselves hoarse till dawn, but don’t cause disturbance in the streets,” Mr. Najib said Sunday, according to the Malaysian news media.
56 2009-08-03 YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) — Nissan, Japan’s third-largest automaker, took the wraps off its much-awaited electric car on Sunday, naming the hatchback the Leaf.

Nissan and its French partner, Renault, have been aggressive proponents of pure electric vehicles with no emissions, announcing plans to mass-market the clean but expensive cars globally in 2012.

Nissan will begin selling the first Leaf cars in the United States, Japan and Europe toward the end of 2010, adding two more models soon after. It expects initial annual production capacity of 50,000 units, which will rise to 200,000 units when the car is introduced globally in 2012.

Coordinating the car’s introduction with the inauguration of Nissan’s global headquarters in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, drove up to the stage in a sky-blue Leaf prototype. Nissan is returning to the port city of Yokohama, where it was founded in 1933, after being based in Tokyo’s high-end Ginza shopping district for 41 years.

Hurt by sliding vehicle sales worldwide since the financial crisis hit last year, Nissan has suspended its goals set under a midterm business plan, with the exception of its aggressive push into electric cars.

71 2009-08-04 You get it wrong in commending the Obama administration for taking a very hard line on Israeli settlements and rejecting reasonable compromises offered by Israel on the issue. So far only negative developments have resulted from the United States position.

The tension has led to the Israelis questioning whether the Obama administration is committed to the historic relationship between the United States and Israel, its principal ally in the Middle East.

The Palestinians believe that they need not negotiate directly with Israel, and the Arab countries are wondering why all the attention goes to settlements when their threatening neighbor Iran is getting closer to building a nuclear weapon.

An agreement on settlements in which Israel dismantles illegal outposts and ends expansion beyond the existing areas makes sense and would have benefits all around. It would put the focus for peace in the Middle East back where it belongs — on the failure of most of the Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to exist and end incitement.

This is a far more productive option than the one you support.
72 2009-08-04 Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last December but excluded the Cubs and Wrigley Field because they are profitable. Yet it is expected that after the creditors’ committees give their input (favoring one bid or saying, “We want more!”), Tribune will fold the team and the ballpark into the overall bankruptcy.

That would doubtlessly inspire headlines like, “Cubbies Go Broke!” and T-shirts with the claim, “101 Years Without a World Series and All We Got Was This Lousy Chapter 11 Filing.”

But it would be a procedural move designed to expedite the sale, not an expression of financial peril.

Peter S. Kaufman, the president and head of restructuring and distressed mergers and acquisitions at the Gordian Group, said companies delayed adding a subsidiary to a Chapter 11 filing “to give the buyer the cleanest title known to man.”

“You lose as many liabilities as the court will let you,” he said, “and no one can argue that you didn’t get enough.”

After the Cubs and Wrigley leave the on-deck circle for their expected turn in the bankruptcy estate, it will be up to the bankruptcy court judge to assess the creditors’ wishes (which can generally be translated as: we want the most cash and we want it now!); the judge could also reopen the bidding for a short time. Perhaps the slightly revived economy will prompt someone to offer $1 billion or more, but at some point, probably sooner than later, the judge will most likely tell Tribune which bidder is best. And Tribune will tell M.L.B.

“Every sale presents its unique challenges,” DuPuy said. “This has been a lengthy process complicated by Tribune’s bankruptcy.” It is possible that more than 800 days after the “For Sale” sign went up, owners could vote on the sale in November. A bidder needs approval from three-quarters of the owners.

Neither bidder has been speaking publicly.

The last time Ricketts, a Chicago bond underwriter whose family built the TD Ameritrade brokerage, was heard from was in a statement after he was chosen in January to negotiate exclusively with Tribune.

But because the Ricketts family’s deal was not completed by the end of his exclusive negotiating period, Tribune brought back Utay and his better-known investor/partner, Leo Hindery, the former president and chief executive of the YES Network who now runs InterMedia Partners, a media investment firm.

Utay is the managing partner of Clarion Capital Partners, a Manhattan investment firm.

“To me, the second bidder looked like a negotiating tactic,” said Rob Tilliss, a sports investment banker who is chief executive of Inner Circle Sports. “It was classic Mergers and Acquisitions 101: after exclusivity ends, you say, ‘Let’s try to open this up.’ In the bull market, you did it to get a higher price. In a recessionary market, it’s to maintain the first bidder’s price. Just to me, the tea leaves look like Ricketts is the preferred bidder.”

Last week, Sam Zell, the real estate mogul who engineered the Tribune takeover in 2007, then led the company into bankruptcy, agreed with Tilliss’s assessment — to a degree — during an interview on CNBC.

Zell, Tribune’s chairman, told the network’s Maria Bartiromo that it would be “safe to say” that “Mr. Ricketts is probably the leading player.” Probably? Was Zell, whose real estate investment philosophy has earned him the nickname the Grave Dancer, being cute? Or was he trying to make Ricketts nervous — and give Utay hope?

At least Zell expressed some hope in the interview that “in the very near future,” the team would be sold.

How near, he can’t say, since the bankruptcy shifted the decision-making power away from him.

But Cubs fans, whose team is tied for first place in the National League Central, are used to waiting. Nearly 37,000 days have passed since the Cubs won their last World Series.
73 2009-08-04 This should, by all rights, be the year that Congress passes a tough chemical plant safety bill, protecting the public from one of the most serious terrorism vulnerabilities. There are already signs, however, that the chemical industry and its Republican allies may succeed yet again in blocking effective safety rules. The White House, which has remained in the background, needs to speak out, and Democratic leaders in Congress should work to make sure a strong bill is enacted without further delay.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, experts have warned that an attack on a chemical plant could produce hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries. Public safety and environmental advocates have fought for strong safety rules, but the chemical industry used its clout in Congress in 2006 to ensure that only a weak law was enacted.

That law sunsets this fall, and the moment is right to move forward. For the first time in years, there is a real advocate for chemical plant security in the White House. As a senator, President Obama co-sponsored a strong bill, and he raised the issue repeatedly in last year’s campaign. Both chambers of Congress are controlled by Democrats who have been far more supportive than Republicans of tough safety rules.

A good bill is moving through the House. It would require the highest-risk chemical plants to switch to less dangerous chemicals only in limited circumstances, but Republicans have still been fighting it. In the House Homeland Security Committee, the Republicans recently succeeded in adding several weakening amendments, including one that could block implementation of safer-chemical rules if they cost jobs. Saving jobs is important, but not if it means putting large numbers of Americans at risk of a deadly attack.

The Obama administration needs to come out forcefully for a clean bill that contains strong safety rules without the Republican loopholes. Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, said last week that she considers chemical plants a major vulnerability and promised that the administration will be speaking out on the subject in the days ahead.

It is looking increasingly likely that Congress will extend the current inadequate law for another year to take more time to come up with an alternative. That would be regrettable. There is no excuse for continuing to expose the nation to attacks that could lead to mass casualties.
74 2009-08-04 But the quickening exodus of young villagers in search of jobs has challenged the traditional mind-set of residents of these communities. The young return on the weekends from nearby cities like Kashan and Qum, bringing back news of a changing world despite longstanding social codes prohibiting dating and requiring women to wear the head-to-toe chador.

In Qum, street vendors hawk revealing blouses, available in an array of bright colors, down the block from the city’s gold-domed holy shrine, the second most sacred in Shiite Islam. A few years ago, even selling T-shirts in this city was illegal.

Garmsar, a town that borders the tiny village where Mr. Ahmadinejad was born, has been turned into a resort for the crowd from relatively liberal north Tehran, who come here on the weekends to sample the famed rose water and camp in the mountainside parks. In the city of Kashan, a few households managed to hold onto their satellite dishes despite a ban and recent police raids, enabling them to keep tuning into the BBC’s Persian-language programs, a local television repairman said.

Indeed, the 45-year-old farmer has a nephew who lives in Kashan and gives him updates from Western media, a much-sought alternative to Iran’s state-run media, which have cast the postelection crisis as an uprising fueled by hooligans and foreign agents. “Yes, I heard about the demonstrations,” the farmer said. “It really disappointed me to learn how the government has treated our own people.”

Many members of the feared Basij militia, which patrolled Tehran after the election, come from these rural communities. In sharp contrast to the rancorous crowds on Enghelab Street in Tehran and those in Shiraz and Isfahan, no demonstrations have occurred in any of these towns.

“We’re powerless here,” said a 26-year-old recent university graduate living in Qum who said he had to resort to a sales job that amounted to selling shares in a pyramid scheme in order to make ends meet. “It would be foolish to protest. We can’t depend on politics now, only on ourselves.”

Security has been particularly tight in Qum, a traditional center of religious study dotted with seminaries. A student from Tehran returning to see his grandparents pointed out undercover Basij agents at the bus terminal. During a late-night visit to a police station, about two dozen plainclothes officers, many of them members of the Basij, were seen preparing to leave on patrol.

Although many local residents utter harsh words of dissent behind closed doors, the overwhelmingly conservative and religious surroundings here mean that only government supporters dare to speak in public. An informal survey at one mosque of a half-dozen worshipers — many of them students at the seminaries — found that they all had voted for Mr. Ahmadinejad.

One 60-year-old worshiper, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, said the “criminal rioters” in Tehran were threatening to destroy Iran. “My three brothers were martyred to protect this republic,” he said. “This country is now under attack.”
75 2009-08-04 The Palm Pre has a large touch screen, slide-out keyboard and fast Web browsing. Palm also likes to point out that another selling point is the smartphone’s ability to link to iTunes, Apple’s popular software for managing music and other media on a computer.

Trouble is, Apple wants to make sure the iPhone is the only cellphone that can do that. So it changed its software to block the Pre’s access to iTunes.

Now Palm is calling foul and is trying to rally the consumer electronics industry to its defense. Palm says that Apple, which allows only its own devices to connect directly with iTunes software, is misusing the standards put in place to foster interoperability between computers and devices using a U.S.B. connection.

Palm has filed a complaint with the U.S.B. Implementers Forum, an industry group established by technology companies that developed the technology that links computers to other electronic devices, claiming Apple is restraining trade. Predicting the outcome of this particular filing is tricky, said Mike Abramsky, an analyst with the investment firm RBC Capital Markets.

“There isn’t much precedent for this case,” he said. “It’s breaking new ground. In my mind, ultimately the users are the arbiters in the outcome of these situations.”

The forum declined to comment on when it would respond to Palm’s filing.

Currently, Palm, which once again has the Pre synching with iTunes, accomplishes the feat by duping the iTunes software into recognizing the phone as an Apple music player, allowing it to synchronize and transfer files between the phone and a personal computer. The tactic has raised some eyebrows among those who think that Palm’s approach itself is a breach of the standards set by the U.S.B. governing board.

But Palm says its strategy of masquerading as an iPod is acceptable because it is in response to Apple’s restriction. “We think we are consistent with our compliance,” said Douglas B. Luftman, an associate general counsel for Palm. “We’re not trying to appear to be anything we’re not  except for interoperability purposes with iTunes.”

Other devices not made by Apple work with iTunes, but generally require an additional download or intermediary step to work. Palm’s strategy, which allows an effortless connection between the smartphone and iTunes, is a first for the industry.

If anything, Palm’s sparring with Apple underscores “how critical the iTunes ecosystem has become for consumers,” said Michael Gartenberg, vice president for strategy and analysis at Interpret, a market research firm based in Los Angeles and New York. “ITunes is the center of gravity where consumers keep their content.”

Palm is not the only company clashing with Apple over its hardware and software policies. Google and Apple are tussling over Apple’s refusal to allow certain Google applications on the phone. On Friday, the Federal Communications Commission said it was looking into those actions.

For Palm and Apple, the iTunes battle is part of a bigger rivalry. The Palm Pre, introduced in June to glowing reviews, has been lauded as a worthy competitor to the iPhone. The competition is also set against Palm’s luring some of Apple’s senior executives. Jonathan J. Rubinstein, Palm’s chief executive, once oversaw iPod development at Apple, and Mike Bell, senior vice president for product development, is another Apple alumnus.

“It’s possible Apple is worried that customers might start buying Palm phones instead of iPhones or iPods,” said J. Gerry Purdy, the chief analyst of mobile and wireless at the research firm Frost & Sullivan.

Mr. Gartenberg, the analyst at Interpret, agreed. “Apple understands that seamless relationship between the iPod, the iPhone and iTunes,” he said. “It’s a big driver behind why consumers are buying their devices, and they’re going to try and protect that.”

Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, said, “As we’ve said before, newer versions of iTunes software may no longer provide synching functionality with unsupported digital media players.”

The stakes are especially high for Palm, which once dominated the smartphone market with its Treo handsets. The company, which has been steadily losing market share since 2007, is counting on the Pre to reverse its fortunes. Paul Coster, an analyst with J. P. Morgan who follows the company, estimated that Palm shipped close to 180,000 devices in its first two weeks and could reach as many as 2.5 million in the fiscal year ending in May 2010.

For Pre owners, accessing iTunes is important, said Katie Mitic, senior vice president for product marketing at Palm. “We appreciate that many, many of our consumers use iTunes as their music or photo management system,” she said. “We just want to make it as easy as possible for them to use it on the Pre.”

Of course, the Pre also has software restrictions on synching with the Zune, the portable media player that is Microsoft’s answer to the iPod, but since it has few users, Palm is not fighting for access there. “The Zune has a much smaller market share,” Mr. Gartenberg said. “There are fewer people using it to control their media, so there are very few other vendor devices who are saying they want to hook into the Zune software.”

Palm’s tiff with Apple also has some people wondering why Apple even bothers. Mr. Purdy, the analyst, described Apple’s decision to thwart Palm’s working with iTunes as “shooting themselves in the foot.”

“All this means is that Palm’s customers would be able to purchase music through iTunes,” Mr. Purdy said. “This would offer an opportunity for increased revenue for Apple.”

Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia who specializes in telecommunications law, copyright and international trade, said, “There’s something very unseemly about what Apple is doing.” He added, “It’s very counter to the ideals of openness, which is a concept Apple pioneered in computing.” In 2007, Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, issued a call to the music industry for openness, titled “Thoughts on Music.”

As for Palm, Mr. Wu said, “It sounds like an uphill battle, in terms of trying to stop Apple from doing this.”

But Palm may have a shot. “The history suggests that openness wins,” said Mr. Wu, citing examples like AT&T’s attempts to restrict the devices attached to its phone lines and Apple’s early attempts to sell printers that worked only with Macs.

It was not immediately clear how long Palm planned to battle future software patches from Apple that disable the smartphone’s compatibility with iTunes. The company did not say whether it would pursue lawsuits or enlist government aid on restraint of trade grounds.

“This is a classic technology cat-and-mouse game,” Mr. Gartenberg said. “It often comes down to which side tires first.”
76 2009-08-04 Senator John McCain of Arizona, President Obama’s Republican opponent in 2008, said he would vote against confirming Judge Sonia Sotomayor as a Supreme Court justice, despite what he called her high qualifications and inspiring life story. Mr. McCain said he had “great respect” for the judge but could not accept her “long public record of judicial activism,” as demonstrated in a 1996 law review article in which she wrote that “a given judge (or judges) may develop a novel approach to a specific set of facts or legal framework that pushes the law in a new direction.” Because Democrats control 60 votes in the Senate, the judge is expected to win confirmation easily.
77 2009-08-04 I can understand why there are so many calls for the heads of the 104 players on the so-called “list” that marks them as guilty for testing positive in the 2003 survey drug test. It seems that publishing this list once and for all would make us all feel better. We could put this chapter behind us, convince ourselves that everyone not on the list is clean as a whistle, and rest assured the game would never return to such disgrace.

But it would be a Pyrrhic victory, at best.

The 2003 drug test was a “survey” test. It was devised to establish the extent of the drug culture in baseball. Instead of just running with innuendo, rumor and guesswork, the Players Association decided that they needed to actually find out for sure.

So this test was put in place to get a true number. It also allowed players a safe place to be truthful (or sloppy). And it is safe to assume that the assurance that the results wouldn’t leave the premises persuaded some to not mask their samples to hide a potential positive result. Here was a chance to actually be forthright, and give the league a truer sense of the extent of a problem that needed to be addressed. Ironically, the players who may have found ways to beat the test seem to be better off today. Those players are quietly in the “clean” column and those who were either sloppy enough or open enough to provide a real sample, which helped move this testing policy forward, are about to get a Scarlet Letter.

The tests were contingent on some semblance of confidentiality. No player in the game would have ever agreed to a collectively bargained drug policy if they had been told beforehand that the results would end up in the public domain. Sure, if the government found a way to bypass that, then we would have had to comply, but instead we got this chronic leaking of confidential and anonymous information after five years, with only selective players being “outed.” Kind of shady. Well, if this is for such a good cause, then why the negative approach? Why pick and chose who gets the center square stockade? How about we start leaking the names of the other 1000 players that didn’t test positive? That would be nice change of pace, but whoever is leaking this information isn’t playing nice, at all.

I enjoyed the chapter in the book about how the true hazard of a situation often falls short of the outrage. We can be fuming about something, but it may not be the most pernicious problem. Of course I have no love for the drug culture in baseball — it was pervasive and, by raising the performance level in the league, probably contributed to shortening of my career — but systems have and will continue to be put in place to curb what will be an ongoing problem. No list of 104 guys being splashed up on your home page will change that.

Nevertheless, there is a lot of outrage being spewed, and I understand. Something dear has been lost. The culture of a game that had the rare ability to bridge generations of fans and players has been broken. Before the era, a home run was a home run and we could look at and admire and compare the achievements of Mantle, Aaron, Kaline, Ruth, Schmidt, and Mays and feel like we were speaking the same language. The steroid era wipes that out: the magic created on the field starts to seem artificial, patronizing us, appeasing us, making us doubt whether we are truly seeing what we are seeing.
78 2009-08-04 FOOD enthusiasts always say they like to travel because of all the different cuisines they can experience. Traveling and food are indeed part of my job. But not like you think.

I’m a former stock guy, a day trader. And we all know what happened to the market. One of the firms I was with folded, and I was struggling to get back on my feet financially.

I was looking for a fun day away from the grind. I saw an eating contest being held in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day right here in New York City, so I thought I’d give it a try. I had a great time, and all I had to do is eat a bunch of corned beef.

So I entered another contest, and the next thing I know, I hold seven world records involving, among other things, tamales, grits and cannoli. Actually, pounds and pounds of that kind of food. Don’t worry. I eat healthy most of the time and I work out five days a week. My cholesterol level is good.

When I’m traveling to a city the day before or the morning of a contest, I avoid food entirely so that I can eat more when it truly counts. And if I’m heading home to New York after competing, I’m probably avoiding food for a very different reason. I probably have eaten too much of something and I can still smell it, and that smell is making me sick.

I sometimes feel sorry for the travelers near me. It’s not that I’m a big guy. I’m not big, even when I’m fully inflated after a contest.

But I can affect the environment around me in a very unfortunate way. Without getting too specific, I think it’s enough to say that when you’ve eaten 53 hot dogs, you smell as if you’ve eaten 53 hot dogs, no matter how hard you try to get rid of the stench. I apologize, therefore, to anyone whose nose I have offended while flying home.

Perhaps because I like to eat, I also like to drink, and you can rarely find me anywhere in life without a beverage.

I prefer big bottles, the two-liter kind. Before carry-on liquids were restricted, I’d arrive at the airport with a two-liter in my hand and I’d take big swigs as I passed through the terminal and before and after takeoff. During the flight, I’d drink the free sodas served on the plane.

Because of regulations, I can’t do that anymore. So I must buy at least a couple of pints of bottled soda after passing through security so that I can have one with me at all times. It’s a complicated ritual and one that drains my wallet. Federal restrictions on liquids and gels have hit me harder than almost anyone I know.

It’s not like I make a lot of money doing this. In fact, I work at a restaurant job to keep my finances stable. But I have to admit the actual size of some of my paychecks from the contests is astounding.

It’s not uncommon for the sponsor of an event to present the winner with a giant cardboard check, like the kind you see in commercials for a popular mail-in sweepstakes.

I tried to take one home with me, but I was told it was too large for the overhead bin and that I’d have to check it instead.

I guess I could have done so, but when you’re as full as I was, all you want to do is recline at home in peace. The thought of waiting at a La Guardia baggage carousel was worse than the thought of eating a 54th hot dog.
79 2009-08-04 MIAMI — Agents with the F.B.I. and the Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program raided a bank and a wholesale mortgage lender in Florida on Monday after the collapse of a proposed partnership that could have brought them more than $500 million in federal bailout money.

Christopher Sharpley, deputy special inspector general for the Treasury program, would not comment on why the bank, the Colonial BancGroup, Florida’s sixth-largest bank, and the mortgage lender, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, based in Ocala, Fla., were being investigated.

Standing outside the offices of Colonial Bank in downtown Orlando — where witnesses said about 50 agents appeared around 9:30 a.m. — Mr. Sharpley said only that search warrants were being executed.

But the inquiry appears to reveal the largest case by far being investigated by the bailout inspector general, given that about $550 million in bailout money is involved. In previous cases made public by the inspector general’s office or its partners in investigating cases of malfeasance involving the bailout, the figures have been substantially lower. In one case earlier this year, a man in Tennessee, Gordon Grigg, pleaded guilty to embezzling $11 million in his clients’ investment funds.

Calls to Taylor, Bean & Whitaker were not returned. Merrie Tolbert, a spokeswoman for Colonial, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., but has more than a third of its assets in Florida, said the company had received a search warrant and was cooperating and staying open, with “business as usual.”
80 2009-08-04 Few people spend their honeymoon catching and drawing blood from village dogs up and down Africa. But Ryan and Corin Boyko, two anthropologists at the University of California, Davis, chose this way to collect valuable genetic data that is casting a new light on the domestication of dogs.

The opportunity to combine love with science arose when Ryan’s brother Adam Boyko, a biologist at Cornell University, was discussing dog genetics with his professor, Carlos Bustamante. Dr. Bustamante, just back from a visit to Venezuela, remarked on how small the street dogs there were.

The two researchers wondered if the dogs carried a recently discovered gene that downsizes dogs from wolves and is found in all small dog breeds. Dr. Bustamante said the idea could be explored by collecting street dogs from up and down South America. Dr. Boyko, knowing his brother was planning a honeymoon in Africa but lacked the money to go far, proposed that the survey be done in Africa instead. “I paid for half their honeymoon,” Dr. Bustamante said.

Ryan and Corin Boyko collected 223 samples of village dog blood from Egypt, Uganda and Namibia. The small gene question has not yet been assessed, but their samples, reported in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have called into question a finding on the origin of dog domestication from wolves.

The origin is thought to be East Asia, based on a 2002 survey of both village dogs and breed dogs. But most of the village dogs in that survey came from East Asia, which could have tilted the outcome. The African village dogs turn out to have much the same amount of genetic diversity as those of East Asia. This is puzzling because the origin of a species is usually also the source of greatest genetic diversity.

The Boykos and Dr. Bustamante do not think dogs were domesticated in Africa — there are no wolves in Africa now, apart from the Ethiopian wolf — but they say the origin may not be East Asia. The issue is better addressed by looking just at village dogs, they think, and by excluding European breeds, which are mostly of recent origin.
81 2009-08-04 To Mr. James there’s a clear connection between much that Mr. Harrison believed in and the work Ms. Brown does at the sanctuary.

“George was one of those people that always seemed to be a good inspiration for other humans, seemed like he was a very socially conscious person, a very responsible person,” Mr. James said. He didn’t know Mr. Harrison, he added, but described himself as an admirer of his music and character.

“George was always trying to put the good message out there,” Mr. James added. “And I think that’s what Jenny has been doing at the farm.”

Ms. Brown and her husband, Doug Abel, opened the sanctuary in 2004, leaving behind careers in film and television. (She was an associate producer of the ABC News special “Report from Ground Zero,” and he was an editor of the Oscar-winning documentary “Fog of War.”) Because they rely primarily on donations to keep the farm going, she said she couldn’t miss the opportunity to recruit Mr. James’s help.

While visiting her mother in Louisville she had bumped into him the day before at an outdoor cafe, and though she immediately recognized him, she left without saying a word.

That their paths would cross again the following night “must have been some kind of sign,” Ms. Brown said.

“Jim was leaving the restaurant and I could feel myself, like, ‘O.K., Jenny, you’ve got to do it,’ ” she recalled. “I told him I was sorry to bother him and that it was unusual how we sat next to each other two days in a row, and here’s what I do and, boy, wouldn’t it be a dream come true if he could lend his support to our mission.”

As it turned out, Mr. James and Ms. Brown found that they had more than just their hometown in common. She’s a vegan, and he’s a vegetarian, as Mr. Harrison was. And they both say they feel they are no better than, for example, a pig or a rooster — a belief that Mr. Harrison also shared, his widow, Olivia Harrison, said.

“He was the kind of guy who always put the bug outside,” Ms Harrison said in a telephone interview from England. “He never stomped on an ant or a spider.”

That a tribute to him will help support a home for abused farm animals is “an appropriate cause,” she continued.

The EP, which Mr. James is releasing under the moniker Yim Yames (“I just wanted to make my existing name funny sounding,” he said), was recorded at the Gallrein Farms in Shelbyville, in a plumbingless bathroom that is part of the same studio where My Morning Jacket recorded its first albums.

It includes four songs from Mr. Harrison’s critically acclaimed “All Things Must Pass,” which he released after the breakup of the Beatles, and two of the songs he wrote for the band, “Long, Long, Long” and “Love You To.” (Mr. James’s songs are also available for download purchase at yimyames.com.)

The Harrison recording is Mr. James’s first solo venture, but not his first charitable foray. He has donated time to the musicians’ outreach project Sweet Home New Orleans, helped raise money for the Center for Women and Families in Louisville and, in April, performed at Radio City Music Hall on a bill that included Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, among others, to benefit transcendental meditation, which Mr. Harrison helped popularize.

“I’m just lucky that I’m making a living with my music,” Mr. James said. “And if I can help.”
82 2009-08-04 The creators of “The Laramie Project,” the acclaimed play about the 1998 murder of a 21-year-old gay man, Matthew Shepard, are finishing work on an 80-minute epilogue to the original work that will be given its debut simultaneously at dozens of theaters across the United States on Oct. 12, the 11th anniversary of Mr. Shepard’s death.

Moisés Kaufman, the playwright and director who, with his Tectonic Theater Project company, wrote and produced the first “Laramie Project,” said the epilogue would explore the impact of the Shepard killing on the residents of Laramie, Wyo., where it occurred. The dialogue will be drawn from interviews with dozens of people there, some of whom were involved in the crime, including Aaron McKinney, who was convicted of murdering Mr. Shepard and who gave an interview to the Tectonic artists.

“We wanted to see what occurs in a small town in the long run when it’s been subject to such a devastating event,” Mr. Kaufman said in an interview. “What has been the long-lasting effect of this watershed moment? Is the fallout of these events positive, negative or perhaps a better question, is it measurable in those terms?”

In holding multiple premieres of the play on the same night, Mr. Kaufman said he was taking a page from the Federal Theater Project, the New Deal program that often opened plays in a multitude of cities on the same night.

Tectonic’s goal is to recruit 100 regional theaters, universities and other arts organizations to hold staged readings of the work, which is called “The Laramie Project  10 Years Later.” More than 40 theaters have committed to the readings, including Arena Stage in Washington, Seattle Repertory Theater, Berkeley Repertory Theater and the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles. The Tectonic company will hold its performance in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center.

“We’re also taking advantage of contemporary technology so that at the New York performance we’ll be connected to the other productions across the nation via the Internet,” Mr. Kaufman said. “We’re giving each production a video recorder so that they can document the event, and we’ll be answering questions live from across the country,” after the performances on Oct. 12, a Monday.

Mr. Kaufman and his epilogue co-writers  Stephen Belber, Leigh Fondakowski, Andy Paris and Greg Pierotti  returned to Laramie last fall to reinterview several townspeople who originally gave accounts to Tectonic in 1998 about Mr. Shepard, Mr. McKinney and the events preceding and following the murder. Those accounts were threaded together verbatim to create “The Laramie Project,” which has had several thousand productions since it opened Off Broadway in 2000.

In writing the new work Mr. Kaufman and his colleagues said they would reflect the range of views currently held by Laramie residents and others about whether Mr. Shepard’s murder was a hate crime by two homophobic men (Mr. McKinney and his accomplice, Russell Henderson) or the result of a botched attempt by the two men to rob Mr. Shepard.

Some Laramie residents, in defending their community during the interviews last fall, argued that they had come to see the motives and circumstances leading to the murder as more complicated than a hate crime. But others there insisted that Mr. McKinney and Mr. Henderson had been driven by their personal disgust toward Mr. Shepard, who was well known as an openly gay man in their town.

Mr. Kaufman declined to reveal details of the interview with Mr. McKinney, who, like Mr. Henderson, is now serving two consecutive life sentences. The two men lured Mr. Shepard from a Laramie bar on the night of Oct. 6, 1998; Mr. Shepard was ultimately tied to a fence, pistol-whipped and left to die.

“As always, what we found defied expectations,” Mr. Kaufman said. “It’s a fallacy to try to define Laramie the way one would describe an individual. There are 27,000 people in Laramie. There are at least 27,000 Laramies.”

“But one of the things that was very clear from the start is the question of how does one measure change,” he continued. “Is it in the number of public monuments that have been erected? Is it in the number of laws that have been passed? Is it in the number of people whose views have been changed?”

Natalie Bohnet, executive director of UApresents, which will stage the reading at a 2,500-seat theater at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, said the campus is expected to sponsor other events in conjunction with the performance in hopes of turning that Columbus Day weekend in October into “a major learning experience.”

“We’ll have some professors of constitutional law holding a forum, and students on campus are expected to hold their own events, so we can look more deeply at hate crimes in America and issues of justice,” she said.

It is unclear if the new work will be performed on that October night in Laramie, but it will be produced as close as Denver, about two hours away by car, at the Newman Center for the Performing Arts. Stephen Seifert, executive director of the Newman Center, at the University of Denver, said he chose to hold a reading in part because of the theater’s proximity to Laramie. (Mr. Shepard died at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., several days after the attack.)

“I was a history major in college, and my focus was the history of the American frontier,” Mr. Seifert said. “No matter what differences of opinions exist about Matthew Shepard, his murder is now a part of the West’s history, of American history.”
83 2009-08-04 As it has among Wall Street banks, a divide is forming in Europe between those banks that remained relatively unscathed during the financial crisis and can now grow and benefit from their investment banking services and those that accepted government funds and need to scale back riskier operations.

HSBC and Barclays could expand their investment banking operations while rivals like Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, which accepted government funds, struggled to cut costs and recover from huge losses. Rather than accept government assistance, HSBC conducted a rights offer and Barclays tapped foreign investors to raise capital.

Shares in HSBC gained about 5 percent in London on Monday, and shares in Barclays jumped 7 percent.

The share price of Barclays has more than doubled since the beginning of this year, while HSBC stock is down about 5 percent amid concern about rising loan-loss provisions and its struggling mortgage lending business in the United States.

Rising loan losses among European banks continue to spook investors. Deutsche Bank’s loan provisions of 1 billion euros, or $1.4 billion, for the second quarter sent the company’s shares lower even though the bank’s net income rose and revenue from sales and trading at its investment bank unit more than doubled.

Barclays is benefiting from an expansion into investment banking services; it bought Lehman Brothers’ American businesses and has been hiring senior bankers in Europe and Asia this year.

Robert E. Diamond Jr., president of Barclays, said Barclays Capital’s expansion was about two-thirds done, but there was more to do in Asia. He expects income from the cash equities and advisory business to continue to grow and said the pipeline for financing, fixed-income and risk management services was “very big.”

Barclays, which said it planned to resume paying dividends before the end of this year, struck a note of caution Monday, predicting that loan losses would continue to go hand-in-hand with unemployment rates.

As bad debts — especially at its ailing American operation — weigh on HSBC’s earnings, the bank stopped offering new loans in March and said that it would review its credit card operations in the United States. HSBC said on Monday that its credit card business was profitable in the first half.

Barclays said profit rose to £1.89 billion in the first half of this year, from £1.72 billion. Impairment charges increased 86 percent, to £4.6 billion, and pretax profit at its British retail business dropped 61 percent. At Barclays Capital, its investment banking unit, earnings rose to £1.05 billion, from £524 million.

HSBC’s personal financial services unit in the United States had a pretax loss of $2.9 billion in the first half, which led to a pretax loss of the global unit of $1.2 billion. But pretax profit at its commercial banking unit rose 49 percent, to $2.4 billion, and earnings at its global banking and markets division, which includes investment banking, rose to $6.3 billion from $126 million.

“We expect the remainder of 2009 to be challenging,” John S. Varley, the Barclays chief executive, said in a statement. “We expect credit market losses to be lower than in the first half but impairment trends to be consistent with those experienced over the first half.”

Stephen K. Green, HSBC’s chairman, was more optimistic when he said that “it may be that we have passed, or are about to pass, the bottom of the cycle in the financial markets.”
84 2009-08-04 Shares of Ford gained 4 percent, and American-traded shares of the foreign car companies Toyota, Nissan and Honda were all higher.

Analysts said the deluge of subsidized auto sales unmasked a sign of economic recovery: pent-up consumer demand. Although consumer spending fell at a rate of 1.2 percent during the spring, consumers are more confident than they were last winter and still willing to spend money when enticed by a bargain.

“The key here is, where’s the consumer mindset?” said Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Consumers, when they perceive the bottom, are willing to jump out and buy high-priced durable goods. The consumer’s getting hungry.”

Signs of improvement in the industrial sectors of China, Europe and Britain bolstered stock markets in Asia, London, Paris and Frankfurt. And more positive readings on manufacturing and the housing market in the United States propelled stock markets on Wall Street toward their highest levels of the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 114.95 points, or 1.25 percent, to end at 9,286.56, the best close since early November. The S.& P. 500 rose 15.15 points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 1,002.63. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.5 percent to cross above the 2,000-point threshold, a line it had not breached since early October. Leading the way were companies that sell oil and natural gas, and those that manufacture basic materials like steel, paper products or plastic. Investors rushed to buy their shares as the price of oil rose more than $2, to $71.58 a barrel, and the prices of gold and copper also surged.

But the stock market’s gains were the dollar’s losses — and the Treasury market’s.

The dollar index, which weighs the currency’s value against six major currencies, fell to its lowest levels since late September.

The price of 10-year Treasury notes fell 1 7/32, to 95 27/32, as investors anticipating an economic recovery sought out higher-yielding investments. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.63 percent, from 3.48 percent late Friday.

A surprising, though slender, 0.3 percent increase in construction spending in June also leavened the mood on Wall Street and offered optimistic forecasters another sign that the housing market was near bottom, if not already staging a recovery.

Builders spent more money in June to construct new homes, hotel projects, commercial centers and other projects, the Commerce Department reported on Monday. Part of the overall rise came from a 1 percent increase in government construction spending as stimulus projects began to get under way.

And the Institute for Supply Management reported that manufacturing activity contracted at its slowest pace since last August as businesses reported more orders and higher production than previous months and improvements in employment conditions. The group’s manufacturing index rose to 48.9 in July, from 44.8 a month earlier.

“This is good news, though we still can’t be sure if further sustained strength is possible in the face of continued consumer deleveraging,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. “This could just be a catch-up after the post-Lehman disaster.”

Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
85 2009-08-04 The news of the F.T.C. investigation in May drew attention to the growing overlap between Apple and Google in areas like mobile phone software, browsers and online video.

Last month, Google announced that it was developing an operating system for computers based on its Chrome browser, which would compete with Microsoft Windows and Apple’s operating system, Mac OS X.

And in recent weeks Apple rejected two of Google’s applications for the , including one for Google Voice, a service that allows people to make cheap international calls and send free . The software could have hurt the business of Apple’s partner in the , , which subsidizes the cost of the iPhone and recoups that money through monthly charges.

Last week, the began an inquiry into why Apple had rejected Google Voice, asking in letters to all three companies whether Apple consulted with AT&T in making its decision.

When the F.T.C. investigation became known in May, Mr. Schmidt first dismissed suggestions that his role on Apple’s board posed a conflict. Then, at a conference in July, he said he would have to talk to Apple and reassess his role on the board.

In a statement on Monday, Mr. Schmidt said he had enjoyed his time on the Apple board, but that the companies “agreed it makes sense for me to step down now.”

Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management, said of the two boards, “These are brilliant people who were smart enough to rationally see what the rest of the world saw a while ago, in terms of the obvious and growing conflicts of interest.”

The F.T.C. is specifically looking into whether Google and Apple violated Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, which says that companies with common board members must limit the sharing of information through those directors.

According to a person briefed on the investigation, Google is arguing that revenue from products like Chrome, which compete with Apple products, did not constitute more than 2 percent of its sales — one of the standards in the law. That argument is difficult to evaluate because Google gives away software like Chrome to drive more traffic to its money-making search engine.

One possible remedy is for Mr. Levinson to leave one of the two boards. The F.T.C. also might ask the companies to sign a consent decree saying that they will refrain from cooperating or sharing strategies in areas where they overlap.

Gary L. Reback, a lawyer at Carr & Ferrell, who in the 1990s helped persuade the Justice Department to pursue its case against Microsoft, said Mr. Schmidt’s departure from Apple’s board suggested Google was taking antitrust questions seriously.

“This is a company with enormous market power, and antitrust enforcers are going to look carefully at everything Google does,” Mr. Reback said. “Google’s first response, which was basically ‘Go fly a kite,’ is not going to work. They are going to have to comply.”

Mr. Schmidt joined Apple’s board in 2006, but his relationship with Apple goes back much further. During Apple’s darkest days in the 1990s, Mr. Schmidt, then chief technology officer of , was among the Valley’s most prominent Apple supporters. almost acquired Apple at one point.

More recently, Google has actively developed software for the Macintosh as Apple has come back from near extinction to capture nearly 10 percent of the market for personal computers.

Google programs for the Mac include its search toolbar, Google Earth and the Picasa photo-sharing software, while applications for Google Maps and are shipped with the iPhone.

When it comes to their common enemy, Microsoft, the companies may have less of a reason to coordinate their strategies nowadays. This year, Microsoft posted its first quarterly year-over-year drop in sales, and it has repeatedly fallen short in trying to extend its dominance of desktop computers to the Web and mobile phones.

Last week, in an effort to catch up to Google in search, Microsoft said it would acquire ’s search business.

Google and Apple “still have a common enemy, but what’s really more interesting is how the common enemy is doing everything it can to make itself irrelevant,” said Stewart Alsop, a longtime industry watcher.

107 2009-08-05 Kim Jong-il’s bright smiles were not returned by . It was strange to see the reclusive Kim so eager and the raffish Clinton so disciplined. Yet the grinning North Korean and stony-faced American were no doubt both savoring their moment of mutual relevance.

The price set by Kim for releasing the two captured American journalists, and , was a few hours basking in the presence of the ex-president who most wanted to visit . Bill Clinton was willing to bow but not scrape.

Hillary sparked an international spat when she said that, as a mother, she understood that the North Koreans were simply unpopular and unruly children misbehaving to get attention.

Now, less than two weeks later, those bad-seed children had managed to command the full attention of her husband.

Maybe it was some clever North Korean revenge plot, giving the limelight to Daddy to punish Mommy. Just as Hillary muscled her way back into the spotlight, moving past her broken elbow and grabbing the focus from her bevy of peacock envoys, she was blown off the radar screen again by an even more powerful envoy: the one she lives with.

It was a moment unique in the annals of diplomacy. Bill was being hailed as a dazzling statesman who might have changed the stormy weather between the U.S. and North Korea, just as Hillary was beginning an 11-day trip to designed to highlight the subjects she most cares about: do-gooder development and women’s issues.

The one in charge of world affairs disappeared from the news all day on Tuesday. The one out of office dominated the news. His plane is rolling down the runway in Pyongyang with the two pardoned women on board? Zowie!

Bill had the additional schadenfreude spritz of knowing that he had usurped three men he’d had fraught relationships with — , and (whose media company the women were working for) — by getting the high-profile assignment to rescue the damsels in distress.

Richardson, labeled by after he endorsed in the campaign, was reduced to the supporting role of CNN commentator, giving Bill props on protocol: “The fact that he saw Kim Jong-il is huge. He only sees big shots and heads of state.”

It’s fun to speculate whether Bill and Kim discussed the exchange of insults with Hillary. (North Korea issued a jibe back that Hillary was “a funny lady” and that “sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.”)

You can picture a charming Bill putting matters in perspective: “Pay no mind to that, Kimmie. She’s an amazin’ woman, but she just goes off sometimes. You should hear what she calls me when she gets riled up. An unruly teenager and then some.”

Conservatives were screeching, naturally, that the Clinton trip would provide propaganda cover to the North Koreans to continue their nuclear shell game.

“Despite decades of bipartisan U.S. rhetoric about not negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages,” John Bolton wrote for The ’s Web site, “it seems that the Obama administration not only chose to negotiate, but to send a former president to do so.”

But the former Bush bullies have no credibility on diplomacy. They spent eight years wrecking it, and the score for them on North Korea is 0-6; zero meetings with Kim and enough plutonium for six nuclear bombs.

Bill Clinton will bring back valuable information about Kim’s mental and physical health. If we’d had that sort of information about the snubbed Saddam, we would have known that he was in his own spiral of doom, trying to bluff his neighbors, with no need for our shock and awe.

Hillary and look bigger when they share the stage with other talented players. And Barack and Bill may have finally started to put behind them — without the need for a beer summit photo-op.
108 2009-08-05 Voting rights advocates have had little success challenging felon disenfranchisement laws in court. Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, became the latest federal court to uphold a ban on voting by convicted felons. Despite these setbacks, the cause is important. Voting rights advocates should keep fighting in the courts, state legislatures and Congress.

In 2000, Massachusetts changed its laws to prohibit felons in prison from voting. Until then, it was one of only three states that let felons vote from behind bars. Even with the change, Massachusetts remains one of just 13 jurisdictions that disenfranchise felons while they are incarcerated but not after they are freed.

A group of prisoners sued, arguing that their disenfranchisement violated the Voting Rights Act. The felons whose right to vote was taken away in Massachusetts are disproportionately black and Hispanic, the prisoners said, partly because of a bias in the justice system.

The appeals court, voting 2 to 1, threw out the suit at an early stage. When it passed the Voting Rights Act, the majority said, Congress did not intend to prohibit states from disenfranchising incarcerated felons.

In dissent, Judge Juan Torruella argued that the ban violated the Voting Rights Act’s plain language, which refers to adding voting qualifications in a manner that results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. He would have allowed the case to proceed further so the plaintiffs could try to prove their claim.

Judge Torruella was right. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, reached a similar conclusion in another case, ruling that the plaintiffs should be able to try to prove their case. In a New York suit, Judge Sonia Sotomayor — in a dissent that has gotten considerable attention — also argued that the Voting Rights Act applies to felon disenfranchisement laws.
109 2009-08-05 City officials are gearing up for a big bake-off in East Harlem.

In the latest attempt by the city to encourage entrepreneurs by providing low-cost space for start-up businesses, the Economic Development Corporation is seeking someone to operate a large, shared kitchen that would be available for rental by those with dreams of developing food businesses.

“New York City is not going to wait around for the recession to end,” Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We’re going to help ourselves.”

Using $1 million allocated by the City Council, the chosen operator would set up ovens, ranges and other cooking equipment in a 4,000-square-foot space in La Marqueta, the largely abandoned, city-owned food market under the commuter-train tracks along Park Avenue near East 116th Street.

The city hopes to install an operator that will offer below-market rates to help foster the development of profitable food businesses.

The preparation of food, especially baked goods and ethnic delicacies, has been one of the few bright spots in the city’s shrinking manufacturing sector, said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the development corporation.

The city is overflowing with aspiring chefs and bakers but “they don’t have the dough to build a kitchen,” Ms. Quinn said. She said food-making employed about 19,000 people in the city and supported more than 30,000 jobs.

“We want to be creating work opportunities for New Yorkers,” Ms. Quinn said at the news conference in the oven room of Amy’s Bread, a thriving baking company that was born in Hell’s Kitchen 17 years ago.

Amy Scherber, the owner of Amy’s Bread, said she started her company in a boarded-up fish market on Ninth Avenue without any help from City Hall. But Ms. Scherber applauded the city’s plan, saying she doubted she could find an affordable space to house a bakery in Manhattan today.

“It’s a little too hard of a dream to accomplish,” she said. “You need to get to a certain size to be successful.”

She added that several of her 150 employees had asked where they could start food businesses of their own, but that she was unable to provide answers. Her own kitchens, on Ninth Avenue and in Chelsea Market, are operating at full capacity, she said, as a crew of six men behind her formed dough into baguettes and fed them into glowing ovens.

Smaller bakers also welcomed the plan for a shared kitchen.

“Brilliant,” said Patricia Helding, the owner of the Fat Witch Bakery, which has a store and a kitchen in Chelsea Market and another production operation in Harlem, blocks from La Marqueta. “What a good way to put tax dollars into action,” she said.

Ms. Helding said she had been a trader on the floor of the American Stock Exchange before she quit to bake brownies in 1991. With no city-subsidized kitchen available, Ms. Helding knocked on doors of churches, asking if she could bake in their ovens when they were idle, she said.

She said she did not begrudge other entrepreneurs  or even other refugees from Wall Street  the benefit of the city’s help in getting started. “The more the better,” Ms. Helding said. “The city should be throwing lifelines, not roadblocks, at its small businesses.”

City officials said the users of the kitchen would be chosen based on the viability of their business plans. Most will be expected to move on to other quarters within a year, Ms. Quinn said. She said the city hoped that makers of ethnic foods that appealed to particular segments of the community would be among the tenants. But Sarah Brannen, a senior policy analyst overseeing the project, said there would be no limits on how many laid-off investment bankers could wind up baking cupcakes there, so long as they could provide feasible business plans.

Ms. Brannen said the critical question would be: “Is it a hobby or is this someone looking to start a business?”
110 2009-08-05 Mr. Whitacre, a 67-year-old Texan, repeated previous comments that the government would take a hands-off approach as a majority owner of G.M. But he left no doubt that he would be driving the auto company’s management team hard to reverse G.M.’s decades-long slide.

“I think one of the things that G.M. has not done very well is change quickly,” he said.

Mr. Whitacre and the board spent Monday and Tuesday learning about the new vehicles coming at G.M. and then driving several of them at the company’s test track in the town of Milford, west of Detroit.

A critical component of the government-led restructuring of G.M. included cutting four of its eight domestic brands — Saturn, Pontiac, Hummer and Saab.

By reducing brands, G.M. is also risking a significant loss in its United States market share, which once stood at 50 percent in the 1960s. The company’s share has slipped to just below 20 percent in the first seven months of this year. Analysts predict that once the brands have been closed or sold, that share could fall as low as 15 percent.

But the board is not willing to concede that outcome, Mr. Whitacre said.

“This board is very focused on changing some things,” he said. “Those things are the bottom line, the volumes and the market shares.”

A 15 percent share, he indicated, would not be acceptable.

Neither Mr. Whitacre nor G.M.’s chief executive, Fritz Henderson, have set any target dates for G.M. to return to profitability after losing more than $80 billion over the last five years.

But stabilizing market share is considered an essential part of the journey to profitability. It will not be easy.

“The board will have to look at, ‘How do we leapfrog our competition and how do we beat Toyota?’ “ said Robert M. Wiseman, a professor at the Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. “The company is in a weak position, so they’re going to have to take some risks.”

Among the cars that Mr. Whitacre drove Tuesday was the Chevrolet Volt, the much-anticipated plug-in hybrid car that runs primarily on battery power.

The vehicle is scheduled to go into production in late 2010 and could be the car that cements G.M.’s comeback.

But before then, G.M. needs to regain the confidence of consumers with more mundane products like the new Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle and Buick LaCrosse sedan.

“We have had a reputation problem and we have to fix that,” Mr. Whitacre said. “As a board we have to do well for the shareholders, and to do that we need to sell a lot of vehicles.”

He said G.M. must emphasize its improvements in vehicle quality and reliability. But he did not rule out a marketing message that asked Americans to at least try the cars built by the company that they own as taxpayers.

“It’s an American company, you have helped it out of a difficult situation, and we intend to pay you back,” he said. “Most everybody wants it to succeed.”

Mr. Whitacre said that the board would evaluate its management team daily. He said there was no schedule on deciding whether Mr. Henderson, who became chief executive in April, was the right person to lead G.M. over the long term.

G.M.’s old board was known for its seemingly endless patience with Rick Wagoner, Mr. Henderson’s predecessor. Mr. Whitacre said he would judge Mr. Henderson on results rather than his strategic vision.

“They have to have leadership,” he said of the management team. “They have to live and breathe this. They have to make things happen, and they have to change things.”

Mr. Whitacre said the board would meet monthly, adding that he expected G.M. to issue quarterly financial reports despite the fact that it was now a private company.

He also promised to visit G.M.’s plants, dealers and workers to gain a better understanding of the company.

“The board will have a big job just to get to know what’s going on,” said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s probably about as close to a clean start as a board ever gets.”

Mr. Whitacre was hardly sure he wanted the job. He was asked several times by Steven Rattner, the former head of the presidential auto task force, before agreeing. “I’d say no, and then they’d call the next day,” he said. “They kept saying, you could be of some help here.”
111 2009-08-05 The United Nations already considers eastern Congo the rape capital of the world, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to hear from survivors on her visit to the country next week. Hundreds of thousands of women have been sexually assaulted by the various warring militias haunting these hills, and right now this area is going through one of its bloodiest periods in years.

The joint military operations that began in January between Rwanda and Congo, David and Goliath neighbors who were recently bitter enemies, were supposed to end the murderous rebel problem along the border and usher in a new epoch of cooperation and peace. Hopes soared after the quick capture of a renegade general who had routed government troops and threatened to march across the country.

But aid organizations say that the military maneuvers have provoked horrific revenge attacks, with more than 500,000 people driven from their homes, dozens of villages burned and hundreds of villagers massacred, including toddlers thrown into open fires.

And it is not just the rebels being blamed. According to human rights groups, soldiers from the Congolese Army are executing civilians, raping women and conscripting villagers to lug their food, ammunition and gear into the jungle. It is often a death march through one of Africa’s lushest, most stunning tropical landscapes, which has also been the scene of a devastatingly complicated war for more than a decade.

“From a humanitarian and human rights perspective, the joint operations are disastrous,” said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a researcher for Human Rights Watch.

The male rape cases span several hundred miles and possibly include hundreds of victims. The American Bar Association, which runs a sexual violence legal clinic in Goma, said that more than 10 percent of its cases in June were men.

Brandi Walker, an aid worker at Panzi hospital in nearby Bukavu, said, “Everywhere we go, people say men are getting raped, too.”

But nobody knows the exact number. Men here, like anywhere, are reluctant to come forward. Several who did said they instantly became castaways in their villages, lonely, ridiculed figures, derisively referred to as “bush wives.”

Since being raped several weeks ago, Mr. Ziwa, 53, has not shown much interest in practicing animal medicine, his trade for years. He limps around (his left leg was crushed in the attack) in a soiled white lab coat with “veterinaire” printed on it in red pen, carrying a few biscuit-size pills for dogs and sheep.

“Just thinking about what happened to me makes me tired,” he said.

The same is true for Tupapo Mukuli, who said he was pinned down on his stomach and gang-raped in his cassava patch seven months ago. Mr. Mukuli is now the lone man in the rape ward at Panzi hospital, which is filled with hundreds of women recovering from rape-related injuries. Many knit clothes and weave baskets to make a little money while their bodies heal.

But Mr. Mukuli is left out.

“I don’t know how to make baskets,” he said. So he spends his days sitting on a bench, by himself.

The male rape cases are still just a fraction of those against women. But for the men involved, aid workers say, it is even harder to bounce back.

“Men’s identity is so connected to power and control,” Ms. Walker said.

And in a place where homosexuality is so taboo, the rapes carry an extra dose of shame.

“I’m laughed at,” Mr. Mukuli said. “The people in my village say: ‘You’re no longer a man. Those men in the bush made you their wife.’ ”

Aid workers here say the humiliation is often so severe that male rape victims come forward only if they have urgent health problems, like stomach swelling or continuous bleeding. Sometimes even that is not enough. Ms. Van Woudenberg said that two men whose penises were cinched with rope died a few days later because they were too embarrassed to seek help. Castrations also seem to be increasing, with more butchered men showing up at major hospitals.

Last year, Congo’s rape epidemic appeared to be easing a bit, with fewer cases reported and some rapists jailed. But today, it seems like that thin veneer of law and order has been stripped away. The way villagers describe it, it is open season on civilians.

Muhindo Mwamurabagiro, a tall, graceful woman with long, strong arms, explained how she was walking to the market with friends when they were suddenly surrounded by a group of naked men.

“They grabbed us by the throat and threw us down and raped us,” she said.

Worse, she said, one of the rapists was from her village.

“I yelled, ‘Father of Kondo, I know you, how can you do this?’ ”

One mother said a United Nations peacekeeper raped her 12-year-old boy. A United Nations spokesman said that he had not heard that specific case but that there were indeed a number of new sexual abuse allegations against peacekeepers in Congo and that a team was sent in late July to investigate.

Congolese health professionals are becoming exasperated. Many argue for a political solution, not a military one, and say Western powers should put more pressure on Rwanda, which is widely accused of preserving its own stability by keeping the violence on the other side of the border.

“I understand the world feels guilty about what happened in Rwanda in 1994,” said Denis Mukwege, the lead doctor at Panzi Hospital, referring to Rwanda’s genocide. “But shouldn’t the world feel guilty about what’s happening in Congo today?”
112 2009-08-05 Dr. Lefever told the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that the United States had no right or power “to promote human rights in other sovereign states,” a direct refutation of Carter policy. And he drew a sharp distinction between oppression by Communist and other brutal governments, speaking out much more strongly against Communism.

His confirmation hearings were far from smooth for him. When senators asked Dr. Lefever about a statement in 1979 to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that all human rights standards should be repealed, he replied that he had “goofed.” To the same committee, he excused the use of torture by the military junta in Chile as “a residual practice of the Iberian tradition.” And Dr. Lefever insisted he had not said that people opposed to his nomination were inspired by Communists. The committee chairman, Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, insisted that he had.

There were also questions about the financial relationship between Dr. Lefever’s research center and Nestlé S.A., a manufacturer of infant formula, which had given more than $25,000 in grants to the center. Critics said the center had helped promote the sale of infant formula, which was a controversial business in many developing nations because polluted water was sometimes all that was available to mix with the formula and because it discouraged breastfeeding.

In a letter to The New York Times on June 16, 1981, Dr. Lefever acknowledged that his center had reprinted an article on Nestlé by a Fortune magazine editor, but said the article was critical of Nestlé for aggressive promotion of baby formula in the underdeveloped nations. He said the center had never published or distributed a pro-Nestlé essay.

On June 5, 1981, five of the Senate committee’s nine Republicans joined eight Democrats to vote against his nomination. Dr. Lefever withdrew his name from consideration.

Reagan, who had campaigned vigorously for Dr. Lefever, suffered his first loss on a confirmation vote.

Afterward, Dr. Lefever said: “I’m tired and I’m sad. But I got a drubbing that few other public servants ever got at this low level and largely without justification.”

Ernest Warren Lefever was born in York, Pa., on Nov. 12, 1919, graduated from Elizabethtown College in 1942 and earned a Ph.D. in Christian ethics from Yale in 1945. For the next three years, he was field secretary of World’s Alliance of YMCA’s, supervising welfare work among German prisoners of war in Europe.

He then led two round-the-world tours for an organization that arranged youth travel before becoming a writer for a weekly radio show on religion in New Haven. His subsequent activities including teaching at several universities, advising Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota, on foreign policy, and working for various church and research groups.

He published his first book, “Ethics and United States Foreign Policy,” in 1957. He argued for stronger presidential powers and an “ethic of responsibility,” which, he wrote, “calls for a choice among available political alternatives, none of which is wholly pure or just.”

From 1981 to 1983, he was part-time consultant to the secretary of state on counterterrorism. He was president of Ethics and Public Policy Center until 1989, after which he was a senior fellow, working out of his home in Chevy Chase, Md.

Dr. Lefever is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Margaret Louise Briggs; his sons, David and Bryce; and four grandchildren.

Dr. Lefever often wrote provocative letters to the editor. In 1995 and 2000, he wrote to The Times to advocate holding convicted criminals up to public humiliation. In the second letter, which urged making prisoners wear stripes and other distinctive garb, he wrote, “a sense of shame is a prerequisite to repentance and rehabilitation.”

In 2006, he struck an entirely new course with “Liberating the Limerick,” a book of 230 “irresistible” limericks he had collected from 9,000 he read. He sanitized the more salacious ones.
113 2009-08-05 It is always interesting to spy on others in the kitchen: their tricks and obsessions are often worth learning. (A finicky rental owner once stipulated that we wash the outside and bottom of each pot each time we used it, not just the inside.) But adapting to others’ tastes in cooking — not to mention dividing up the prep work, the expenses and the recycling — can be distracting and unpretty. Drawing up a roster sounds tedious, but it is hugely helpful: go as micro as you can stand, down to supermarket and farm stand shopping, sweeping and garbage duty. And the rest of the time, stay away.

As a cook, choose the dishes and meals you care about most, and seize control.

The bold move is to grab the marquee meal with some kind of centerpiece meat, like a grilled butterflied leg of lamb or some choice rib-eyes. If you have your heart set on particular cuts, take them with you: supermarkets have come a long way, but finding a whole beef brisket or spatchcocked chickens in them can be impossible. Simple roasted or boiled local vegetables are beautiful complements to the meat, especially with a pat of herb butter, which takes about 10 seconds to mash together.

Cleaning up someone else’s mess is not pleasant, but it comes with the territory. On one family weekend with 14 mouths to feed, a cousin suggested that we needed a K.M.O. — a kitchen maintenance organizer — to scrutinize each pot and bowl dirtied, and apportion responsibility for cleaning it. This is tempting but impractical.

Sharing a kitchen should only be tried with companions whom you know to be conscientious and with deep reserves of good will. (In the absence of conscience, choose companions with funds enough to pay someone else to do daily chores.) Don’t share a house with people you can’t comfortably carve up a restaurant bill with.

The goal, of course, should be spending less time in the kitchen and more time in a deck chair.

The easiest summer dinner known to man, pasta con salsa crudo, is a one-bowl, infinitely variable riot of seasonal flavors. It can be made with fancy Italian tuna and local heirloom tomatoes for foodies, or with supermarket mozzarella and tomatoes for children, or with excellent olives and extra pine nuts for vegetarians. It puts you in the kitchen for about a half-hour at the tail end of lunchtime. After that, all there is to do is cook the pasta, and serve with or without crusty bread, boiled corn, sliced tomatoes, or of course, a nice, simple green salad — dressed just the way I like it.
114 2009-08-05 Even as India rushes toward a future as a technology and services powerhouse, there has been slow, halting progress in its agrarian economy, which still sustains more than half of its 1.1 billion people. Hobbled by small farm sizes, an intense reliance on fickle monsoon rains and extensive government control, Indian farmers are less productive and more vulnerable than their peers in other developing countries like Brazil and China.

Economists say India’s approach to regulating sugar is an example of how populist policies can hurt the very people they were meant to help: farmers and the rural poor.

India, of course, is far from alone. The United States restricts imports and uses subsidies to help producers maintain domestic prices at about twice the level of world prices. (Sugar retails for 56 cents a pound in the United States, up 5 percent from December.)

Europe also protects its sugar industry. In 2006 the European Commission began changing the way it controls the commodity and started paying high-cost manufacturers to stop making sugar.

Sugar policies in the West are typically intended to bolster the incomes of politically powerful farmers and factory owners, but here in India, policy makers try to walk the line between helping farmers and consumers. An estimated 28 percent of Indians still live below the poverty line.

Moreover, sugar is an Indian culinary and cultural touchstone. It is liberally mixed into everything from syrupy tea to dense sweets. (The country’s sweet tooth also has a dark side. Diabetes is growing faster here than almost anywhere else in the world.)

Even now with sugar prices up sharply, demand is growing, because India’s population is growing, said Sanjay Manyal, a sugar analyst at Icici Direct.com, a securities firm.

To meet that demand, India will probably import 20 to 30 percent of the sugar it uses this fiscal year. Less than two years ago, the country exported 20 percent of the sugar it made.

To understand India’s sugar problems, industry officials say it is important to consider what happened in 2006 when the government banned exports to bring down prices. Those efforts were almost too successful. Within a few months prices began falling as it became clear that farmers had planted too much cane.

Farmers said conditions were so bad in 2007 and 2008 that sugar mills, which usually arrange to have cane harvested, did not even bother to send out crews. Many farmers, including Mr. Gujar, burned their crop in the field.

“Government policy, well intentioned though it may have been, seems to have aggravated the cycle,” said Samir S. Somaiya, president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association and a mill owner.

The government then tried to help by subsidizing exports. At the same time, farmers began switching to other crops. The ground was being laid for the current shortage.

Industry officials and analysts say the recent rise in prices has lured some farmers back to sugar cane, but India will not produce enough to satisfy domestic demand until at least 2011.

Officials at India’s Agriculture Ministry, which regulates sugar, declined to answer questions.

In addition to controlling international trade, policy makers decide how much sugar each mill can sell every month, set the minimum price paid to farmers and require factories to sell 10 percent of their product at below-market prices for distribution to the poor. Recently, policy makers also banned futures trading in the commodity.

Some officials have recommended easing control over sugar, but politicians are reluctant to do anything that might be seen as driving up food prices.

Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer, offers an interesting contrast to India’s volatile industry. That country has steadily increased production and exports, and now stands to benefit from India’s shortage.

In recent years Brazil has used more than half of its harvests to produce ethanol, which, when blended with gasoline, has become a profitable fuel. Brazilian factories and farmers grow sugar cane on plantations of hundreds or thousands of acres, while Indian farmers have an average of two acres. The small scale makes it prohibitively expensive for most Indian farmers to invest in efficient irrigation systems or mechanized harvesters.

Some industry officials here say they are trying to do what Brazil has done on a smaller scale. Factories are installing distilleries to make ethanol from molasses, a byproduct of sugar production, to sell primarily to liquor companies and, to a lesser extent, for use as fuel. Demand for ethanol-blended fuels is low because the price of regular diesel and gasoline is subsidized by the government. Also, India does not require the use of blended fuels, as Brazil and the United States do.

Sugar factories are also investing in power plants that are fueled by the fiber, or bagasse, left over after juice is squeezed out of the cane. Electricity can fetch high prices because of India’s chronic energy shortage, said Rajiv S. Kadapatti, director of Jamkhandi Sugars, which owns a factory in the southern state of Karnataka.

“Two years ago sugar gave us no profit,” he said. “It was power generation that kept us afloat.”

Farmers are also diversifying, growing bananas, vegetables and other unregulated cash crops. Residents of Loni Kalbhor, a village about 14 miles from the city of Pune, are eyeing other opportunities.

Mr. Gujar, the banana grower, expects that he will be able to farm for another decade before his land is swallowed up by the urban sprawl around Pune, which is home to many growing manufacturing and technology companies. Many of his relatives have already quit farming and his teenage son and daughter have no interest in growing bananas or sugar cane.

“They won’t do this,” he said. “They will change.”
115 2009-08-05 Peace, love, understanding and nostalgia do not seem to be quite enough to resurrect a 40th-anniversary version of Woodstock. Michael Lang, one of the event’s original promoters, told Rolling Stone magazine that he had dropped plans to put together a third-anniversary concert — after ones in 1994 and 1999. Asked why, Mr. Lang told the magazine simply: “Money. No sponsors.” Mr. Lang, one of four partners who helped produce Woodstock in 1969 (right), earlier dropped plans to hold a free concert in Prospect Park in Brooklyn in mid-August because he could not find ways to cover the $8 million to $10 million it would have cost to mount. Then he began planning for an event to be held in late September. It would have coincided with Climate Week NYC, a joint effort of the United Nations, New York City and the Climate Group, an international awareness organization — scheduled for the week of Sept. 21, to coincide with the opening of the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly — to draw attention to global climate change. But Woodstock will still be very much in the air this summer. “Taking Woodstock,” a comedy directed by Ang Lee, will open in theaters on Aug. 28. This movie is based on a book by Elliot Tiber, who ran a motel with his parents in Bethel, N.Y., during the Woodstock festival. Mr. Lang is one of the movie’s characters, played by the actor Jonathan Groff.
116 2009-08-05 Regarding the price cut for digital books, Mr. Haber said: “We have to offer value. It’s clear e-books should be less expensive than regular books, with the savings on printing and logistics getting passed on to the consumer.”

Book publishers will still retain their traditional cut of every e-book sale — about half the hardcover retail list price. But they are concerned that as online retailers like Amazon and Sony gain market power, they will eventually tire of losing money on e-book sales and ask publishers for lower wholesale prices, a move that would cut into their profit margins.

“We all know that these companies are taking a loss and that’s not going to continue forever,” said Jonathan Karp, publisher and editor in chief at Twelve, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group. But he added that “$9.99 has now become the effective price for e-books in August of 2009. Let’s just take a breath and see how long this lasts.”

In response to the $9.99 list price, some publishers are thinking about postponing the release of the digital versions of their most popular books, lengthening the period in which only the higher-priced hardcover versions are available. This is similar to the approach taken by Hollywood studios, which allow DVD sales and rentals only after a film has left theaters.

“To the extent that best-seller and new-release prices have really converged at the under-$10 price point, it is really going to heighten the attention paid to this whole release window question,” said David Steinberger, chief executive of Perseus Books.

The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, the division of Random House that is publishing “The Lost Symbol,” Dan Brown’s follow-up to “The Da Vinci Code,” will release the novel in hardcover in September but has yet to decide when it will release the electronic version.

Similarly, Twelve, which is publishing Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s memoir, “True Compass,” in hardcover in October, has not announced a release date for that e-book.

Sony’s price cut on digital books and the new devices may not be enough to help it catch up to Amazon. One significant drawback to Sony’s new devices is that, unlike the Kindle, they cannot connect wirelessly to an e-book store. Owners of Sony Readers must plug their devices into a computer to buy and download books.

The new Readers also cannot access magazines or newspapers, and Sony has yet to develop a version of its reading software for other devices like the iPhone. Mr. Haber from Sony said that the company was working on developing all of these features.

Sarah Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said Sony had publicly indicated that the two new devices were part of a new suite of e-reading products it would introduce this year. She said it was a “reasonable assumption” that Sony would introduce another device in the fall that had wireless features.

Sony had planned to unveil the two new Readers later this month, but images of the devices were posted on gadget blogs this week after one retailer prematurely added them to its online store.
117 2009-08-05 The broader economy may be testing the bottom, but for American consumers, there appears to be no end yet in sight for falling wages and higher living expenses.

That was the picture painted Tuesday by the government’s monthly report on personal incomes and consumer spending. While consumers spent more in June, they did so because prices of food and energy were rising, and not because they were ready to spend freely again.

Personal incomes sagged as employers continued to cut wages and reduce working hours. And the personal saving rate, which had been rising, dropped sharply from a month earlier as one-time transfer payments from the government stopped arriving in people’s bank accounts.

“Consumers are not spending any more money,” Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, said. “They’re still consolidating.” Personal income fell back 1.3 percent in June, just a month after a one-time $250 payment to Social Security recipients lifted it by the same amount. And in a sign of continuing troubles for American workers, private wages and salaries fell for a fourth month, slipping a seasonally adjusted $28.6 billion after a $11.3 billion drop a month earlier.

Private wages and salaries have fallen for each of the last 10 months as businesses trimmed costs by freezing pay, imposing salary cuts and reducing the work week. Personal income has dropped by a seasonally adjusted $372 billion since September.

“Wage and hour cuts are big right now,” Adam York, an economist at Wells Fargo, said. “The economy remains fairly weak, and the labor market even weaker. We’ve lost 6 million jobs, and unemployment is rapidly heading toward 10 percent. There’s just not a lot of wage pressure out there right now.”
118 2009-08-05 Wall Street was torn in two directions on Tuesday.

An increase in the number of home sales under contract added to hopes that the housing market’s three-year decline had hit bottom and was beginning to reverse course.

But a separate report showed that Americans were earning less, and spending more only to keep up with rising food and energy prices, casting a pall over any notion of a consumer-driven recovery.

So one day after markets rose to their highest levels of the year — and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed above the 1,000-point level — Wall Street meandered for much of the day, swinging between positive and negative before all three market gauges ended the day slightly higher.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.63 points, or 0.36 percent, at 9,320.19, while the S.& P. 500 rose 3.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,005.65. The Nasdaq gained 2.7 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,011.31. Shares in Europe closed down slightly.

With stocks at their highest levels since autumn and more expensive on a price-to-earnings basis, some analysts are expecting a correction. But even bearish traders are reluctant to bet their money on such a move.

139 2009-08-06 WHEN do communities want prisoners in their backyards? When the census rolls around.

Counting inmates as residents — which is permitted under the Census Bureau’s “usual residence” rule — skews political power, clout and resources. Unless the Obama administration acts soon to change the residence rule, these imbalances will be built into the 2010 census.

The problem is simple: the usual residence rule creates political districts that would not otherwise exist. For example, the district of State Senator Elizabeth O’C. Little, a Republican in upstate New York, has 13 prisons, adding approximately 13,500 incarcerated “residents.” Without the inmate population, Ms. Little would face an uncertain future. Her district would probably have to be redrawn because it wouldn’t have enough residents to justify a Senate seat.

First, inmates in nearly all states aren’t allowed to vote, yet their presence affects electoral representation in places where they do not live permanently.

Second, a disproportionate number of state prison inmates are from urban areas. Most state prisons, however, are in rural areas. As a result, resources and electoral authority are transferred from inner cities to rural jurisdictions.

The effects are plain to see. Cities lose out on funds that could be used both for crime prevention and prisoner rehabilitation; rural areas do their best to thwart reform because they don’t want to lose the benefits that prisons confer on them.

What can be done?

The politics are complicated. Municipal leaders — including the mayor of New York City — support counting inmates in their last known address before incarceration. Rural officials support keeping the residence rule as it is. Criminal justice experts think it’s best to count inmates as residents of the communities where they are likely to return after their incarceration. (This, after all, is where the re-entry programs need to be.)

The Obama administration would do well to find a middle path. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Robert Groves, director of the Census Bureau, should propose an administrative change to the residence rule: Inmates returning to their home communities before the next census period — those serving a sentence of 10 years or less — should be counted in their home communities. Those serving more than 10 years should be counted where they are in custody. (The residence rules for other large transient groups, like college students, wouldn’t be affected by this change.)
140 2009-08-06 Re “Are We What We Search?” by Eduardo Porter (Editorial Notebook, July 31):

Lawrence Summers interprets the decrease in Google searches for the “Great Depression” as a return of consumer confidence in the economy, which seems to correlate with improvement in various parameters indicative of economic recovery.

It is true that the economy appears to be more stable now than during the free fall we experienced only a few months ago, but consumer confidence alone is not enough to correct the underlying faults within our investment markets as they currently exist.

Unless the regulatory scheme is changed to prevent companies that are “too big to fail” from taking inordinate risks with the expectation of government bail-outs, I don’t see any reason to believe that history won’t repeat itself.
141 2009-08-06 “Chemical Plants Could Be More Safe” (editorial, Aug. 4) appears to confuse the issues of safety and security. The word “safety” is continually used to describe security legislation under consideration in Congress, seeming to imply that United States-based chemical producers are not already subject to chemical safety regulations.

The reality is that our businesses, which significantly contribute to domestic manufacturing, are strictly regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies. In fact, we are proud to have one of the best safety records of any manufacturing sector.

The partisan legislation Congress is considering would provide a federal security agency the authority to dictate chemical engineering techniques to chemical engineers. Given that the Obama administration itself has extended the current, strong security regulations for another year, it clearly lacks confidence in this veiled environmental policy ploy. Security regulations should be based on science, not emotion.
142 2009-08-06 TORONTO — It was easy to look past Wednesday night’s game, with two nondescript starters and 20,000 empty seats at Rogers Centre. But that is not Joe Girardi’s job.

Girardi, the Yankees’ manager, is there to win every game, even if fans care more about the coming series against the Boston Red Sox. So Girardi used his best setup men to secure crucial outs in an 8-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Win now, the theory goes, and worry about a tired bullpen later.

“It’s business; you can’t get higher for one game than another,” Girardi said. “You have to win that night because you never know what’s going to happen the next day.”

Alfredo Aceves (7-1) earned the victory with two strong innings in relief of Sergio Mitre. Working his second game in a row, Phil Hughes collected three outs in the eighth. Girardi said he would probably not use Hughes on Thursday, and possibly not Aceves, either.

But they helped the Yankees increase their lead in the American League East over Boston to two and a half games, the same edge they had at the start of a three-city trip that finished with three wins in a row.
143 2009-08-06 AKRON, Ohio — The PGA Tour wasted no time finding a new sponsor and location to replace the former Buick Open. It announced Wednesday that the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., would host the Greenbrier Classic, with an increased purse of $6 million.

Just a day after Buick, a unit of General Motors, officially announced it was ending its sponsorship, Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, presided over a teleconference from this week’s W.G.C.-Bridgestone Invitational to announce the partnership with Greenbrier’s new owner, Jim Justice.

Justice, a coal company magnate, purchased Greenbrier out of bankruptcy in May from CSX Corp. The new event will be played on the Old White Course on the grounds of the 231-year-old resort, a national historic landmark. With essentially the same dates as the Buick Open for at least the first year of the six-year deal, from July 29 to Aug. 1 in 2010, it will precede the P.G.A. Championship by a week.

“We are delighted with the opportunity to return golf at the PGA Tour level to one of the truly great resorts and golf destinations in the world,” Finchem said. “Jim Justice has shown a real passion and commitment, not just to host a PGA Tour event, but to build it into a premier stop on the PGA Tour.”

Finchem said the tour would continue to talk to Buick, which also ended its relationship with the 2010 Buick Invitational in San Diego.

“We will be working for a solution for San Diego as well,” Finchem said.

TOUGH QUESTION Lee Westwood, last year’s runner-up here and the third-place finisher at this year’s British Open, was chuckling Wednesday about a remark a junior golfer made to him the day after the Open.

Westwood was handing out trophies at a junior competition at his home club when a young golfer asked what Westwood called an “unsubtle” question about a putt by Westwood that went 10 feet past the 72nd hole, leading to a three-putt bogey.
144 2009-08-06 Rarely has the view from inside a company been so at odds with the view outside it. Could Goldman Sachs have lived if all those other giant banks had failed? Could it alone survive financial Armageddon?

Goldman executives are dismissive, even defiant, when critics argue that the bank is playing a heads-we-win, tails-you-lose game with American taxpayers. And yet the questions keep coming. Last month the story of Goldman’s postcrisis success — and conspiracy theories surrounding it — leapt from the business pages to the cover of Rolling Stone.

The idea that nothing has changed for Goldman Sachs strikes many outsiders as absurd. In this era of mega-bailouts, Goldman is widely perceived, on Wall Street and in Washington, as too big and important to fail. If its bets pay off, Goldman profits and its employees get rich. If its bets go bad, ultimately taxpayers will have to pick up the bill.

“Many observers on the market believe that Goldman and others of its size now have a free insurance policy,” said Elizabeth Warren, the chairwoman of the Congressional oversight panel for the $700 billion bailout fund. “Whether they do or not is less important than the fact that many in the market believe they do. That means at some level Goldman is playing with the American taxpayers’ future.”

Is Goldman gambling at America’s expense? Of course not, Mr. Cohn said. Should it change its business strategy in the wake of the gravest financial crisis since the Depression? No. Is Goldman taking big risks to make big profits? Courting more outrage over Wall Street pay with its plans to pay lavish bonuses? Throwing its weight around in Washington?

No, no, no.

Goldman executives dispute suggestions that high-stakes market gambles are behind its big profits — $3.4 billion in the second quarter. And they are dumbfounded when people like Ms. Warren suggest companies like Goldman, which paid back its bailout money last month, now operate with an implicit taxpayer guarantee.

After so many wrenching changes on Wall Street and in the economy, it might come as a surprise that the post-bailout Goldman is virtually indistinguishable from the pre-bailout one.

The bank has strengthened its capital base and reduced its use of leverage — the borrowed money that turbo-charges profits on the way up and can prove devastating on the way down. But Goldman sees little reason to change the way it does business. In fact, its executives are surprised that anyone would suggest it should.

Even Goldman’s conversion to a traditional banking company at the height of the crisis — a step many predicted would clip Goldman’s gilded wings — has been deftly sidestepped.

It is, in other words, business as usual at Goldman — and what a business it is. Quarter after quarter, Wall Street executives scour Goldman’s results hoping to figure out how the bank makes so much money. Mr. Cohn and other executives, in recent interviews, sketched the broad outlines of an answer. Mr. Blankfein declined to be interviewed for this article.

During the second quarter, Goldman bet, correctly, that the financial markets would calm down. It wagered that market volatility would decline and that certain securities tied to the troubled home mortgage market would revive. Its securities underwriting business bounced back too.

A vast majority of profits came from trading on behalf of clients like big mutual funds, pension funds and endowments, rather than from staking Goldman’s own money in the markets, Mr. Cohn said. Proprietary trading now accounts for about 10 percent of profits, down from 20 percent in 2005. Goldman dominated institutional trades linked to changes in a closely watched stock market index, the Russell 2000, and is benefiting because old competitors like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are no longer around.

“We don’t have to outsmart the market today,” said Mr. Cohn. “We just have to do what our clients want us to do.”

But unlike some of its rivals, Goldman is not shy about taking risks. The bank stood to lose as much as $245 million on any given day during the second quarter, based on a common measure known as value at risk, or VAR. That was up from $184 million in mid-2008. But VAR captures only about a fifth of Goldman’s market risks and excludes investments that are difficult to value.

“Our risk appetite continues to grow year on year, quarter on quarter, as our balance sheet and liquidity continue to grow,” Mr. Cohn said. He and other executives say Goldman carefully manages its risks, which, for the most part, it has.

Goldman’s latest quarterly disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed on Wednesday, provide another glimpse into the bank’s activities. Aided by cheap credit, Goldman generated more than $100 million in daily revenue from trading on 46 separate days during the second quarter — a record.

Since late 2007, Goldman has reduced its exposure to illiquid investments, which can pose dangers because they are traded so infrequently, by 8 percent. Its total exposure to these so-called Level 3 assets still stood at $50.4 billion. While VAR is up, other risk measures were down, and the bank’s capital base has grown significantly. Lately, Goldman has been taking more risks in stocks, but fewer in fixed income, currency and commodities.

Some of Goldman’s recent practices are drawing scrutiny from government officials. In its filing Wednesday, Goldman said various government agencies had inquired about its compensation practices, as well as its role in the market for credit derivatives, which fueled the financial crisis.

But over all, the events of the past year have not changed the way Goldman views or manages the risks it takes, said David A. Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer.

“There are a few business units that are taking a little more risk. Most are taking less,” Mr. Viniar said.

Mr. Cohn, Goldman’s president, acknowledges his bank is systemically important, meaning that its failure would probably send financial shock waves around the world. But he said that the implications of this status were unclear and that Goldman had no government backing.

David A. Moss, a professor at Harvard Business School, disagrees. He says the painful lessons of the financial crisis show the federal government now stands behind all systemically important financial institutions.

“We’re in a situation where we’ve extended important guarantees, both explicit and implicit, to almost all major financial institutions, yet we don’t have the regulations in place to control the excessive risk-taking that could result,” said Mr. Moss, the author of “When All Else Fails: Government as the Ultimate Risk Manager.”

In any case, Goldman has certainly helped itself to government programs that were put in place to stabilize the financial industry. For instance, the bank has issued billions of dollars of bonds guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Since March it has sold $3.4 billion worth without government backing.

And Goldman’s conversion to a bank holding company, executed at the height of the crisis, gives the bank access to money from the Federal Reserve. In exchange, Goldman had to increase its capital, reduce its leverage and accept Fed oversight.

Many analysts predicted that switch would force Goldman to rein in riskier businesses like proprietary trading and parts of its commodities operation. But Goldman has largely carried on as usual. It has received standard exemptions that give it two years to comply with federal regulations governing bank holding companies.

“They are very happy to go back to a business model that year-in and year-out has made them untold wealth,” said John C. Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University.

Mr. Cohn concedes that Goldman, along with other banks, bears some responsibility for the financial crisis. “There’s no performance angel in this,” he said. But he bristles at all the fingers being pointed at Goldman.

“Every bank has to accept a degree of responsibility, but it sometimes feels like we’re being disproportionately blamed,” he said.
145 2009-08-06 “Activities undertaken in the orientation camps will not be deemed to be engaged in pursuant to the player’s N.H.L. standard player contract,” the deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in an e-mail message, explaining the league’s position.

Daly added that covering players during the camps was “not the N.H.L.’s problem, and it shouldn’t be the N.H.L. clubs who are required to bear the risk for something they are not even involved in or have oversight over.”

Players will be covered for the Games themselves under longstanding agreements between the league, the union and the International Ice Hockey Federation.

The final Olympic rosters are expected to be announced in late December, ahead of the Olympic tournament at Vancouver, which begins on Feb. 16, 2010. The orientation camps being held this month are intended mostly to inform players about drug testing and other procedural matters and to discuss strategy and tactics.

“The camp is not at all about a tryout; that wouldn’t be fair to the players,” Steve Yzerman, executive director of the Canadian team, said Wednesday. “It’s really about getting organized. The actual selection of the players is really based on their performance during the N.H.L. season.”

Last month the players union informed members who were invited to various preliminary Olympic camps in North America and Europe that some federations’ coverage was inadequate. Although stopping short of recommending that the players skip the on-ice part of the camps, the union did point out that those who did skate could be taking a serious risk.

“While our N.H.L.P.A. members look forward to the opportunity to represent their countries at the Olympics, it is unreasonable to request that players participate in on-ice summer orientation sessions without sufficient insurance against injuries,” the union’s executive director, Paul Kelly, said at the time.

Shortly afterward, all eight N.H.L. invitees stayed away from Germany’s orientation camp.

The players association said it was investigating whether Slovakia adequately covered participants at its orientation camp in Poprad. The camp began on Tuesday and runs through Saturday.

Several players at the camp are under contract to N.H.L. teams, including the new Rangers forward Marian Gaborik and Boston’s Zdeno Chara, who won the Norris Trophy last season as the league’s best defenseman.

The Sweden and Finland camps will not include on-ice elements. Russia will have an optional on-ice session that the union does not consider problematic.

One invitee to Canada’s camp, San Jose forward Joe Thornton, said last month that he would skate at the camp despite the union’s concerns. On Wednesday, his brother and agent, John Thornton, said that neither he nor Joe would make any further statement “until the league, the players association and Hockey Canada have figured everything out.”

Yzerman, also vice president of the Detroit Red Wings and a veteran of seven senior-level world tournaments for Canada as a player, said Wednesday that the issue over insurance was “not really a problem” in preparing to choose the Olympic team.

“We knew insurance would be an issue coming in, as it was when I was a player in ’02,” he said. “But I went ahead and skated anyway. Besides, we won’t be asking the players to come to Calgary and go 100 percent and try to kill each other. On the ice it will be controlled, more of a run-through for power plays and penalty-killing and the like.”

The 2010 Olympics will be the fourth consecutive Games in which the N.H.L. will participate fully, suspending its regular season.

The league has pointedly avoided agreeing thus far to participation in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The N.H.L. and the top Russian league, the K.H.L., have repeatedly clashed over disputed contracts, player poaching and transfer fees.
146 2009-08-06 The classical music and dance worlds continue to face difficulties mounting new work, or in some cases even paying their artists. The administrative offices of the Houston Symphony are closed this week as part of a furlough deal the company announced last week, The Houston Chronicle reported. The symphony’s 86 musicians will also take two unpaid weeks off in the coming months — up from one week in previous years — and its conductors will accept reduced salaries in a move that is expected to save nearly $900,000, part of an overall budget reduction of $1.5 million for the 2009-10 season. Matthew VanBesien, the symphony’s executive director said that the group’s performance schedule would not be affected by the cuts. Meanwhile the members of the Minnesota Orchestra have agreed to pay and pension cuts in a move that will save $4.2 million over three years, The Star-Tribune in Minneapolis reported. And just across the border Le Groupe Dance Lab, a contemporary troupe that’s been a fixture in Ottawa for 40 years, said it will cease operations in the fall, The Globe and Mail in Toronto reported. “Many factors, financial and otherwise, have led to this extremely difficult decision,” John Manwaring, the company’s chairman, said in a statement. The National Archives of Canada will collect the group’s artistic and administrative records.
147 2009-08-06 With the legal documentation to back up his intellectual property rights, Mr. Lubetzky sent the offending company a cease-and-desist letter, which achieved the desired result. “Too many entrepreneurs forget there is more to I.P. than just patents,” said Mr. Lubetzky, who happens to be a lawyer.

2. Once I get a trademark, my brand is safe.

It may be. But consider what happened to Tracey Deschaine, who runs a restaurant called Dixie Picnic in Ocean City, N.J.

When Ms. Deschaine opened her business in 2006, she secured trademarks on her business name and logo and on the name of her signature item, “upcakes,” which are upside-down frosted cupcakes. The problem, she says, was that even though she had obtained the trademarks, someone monitoring the activity on the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s Web site had spotted her application and secured upcakes.com as the Web address, or U.R.L., before she could.

“I had no idea that even though I have a trademark, someone else could just go register the U.R.L.,” she said. “I wish I had planned ahead and bought the site before I did that.”

3. Having a patent gives me the right to produce something.

This is a very fundamental misunderstanding. Actually, what a patent does is give you the right to prevent someone else from producing what your patent covers. “Having a strong I.P. position helps ensure that other people pay you for your innovation like they would a toll on a road,” Mr. Kocher said.

But even if you do have a patent, there’s no guarantee that someone won’t try to get around it. There’s also no guarantee that you will win if you fight that person. But if you have your I.P. ducks in a row and a commitment to do whatever you can to defend those rights, you do have a fighting chance — even in a fight against a much larger company.

Consider the example of Cryptography Research, a 20-employee technology firm in San Francisco that specializes in data security. Beginning in 2004, the company made the decision to pursue litigation against the credit card giant Visa, which Cryptography asserted was infringing on its patents covering smart cards. To pursue the case against Visa, however, Cryptography’s founder, Paul Kocher, knew he needed a serious war chest in addition to his patent portfolio.

That’s why he decided to sell off another piece of his business, patents covering technology that protects Blu-ray discs from piracy, to Macrovision, which is now known as Rovi, in 2007 for $45 million. “All of a sudden we became a formidable opponent for someone who thought we couldn’t fight,” Mr. Kocher said. In the end, the gamble paid off, as the two companies settled out of court, with Visa’s agreeing to license the technology from Cryptography.

4. If I have a patent or trademark in the United States, I don’t need to worry about the rest of the world.

It depends on your business model. Intellectual property rights, which also include country-specific U.R.L.’s, need to be obtained country by country, some of which protect them better than others. The cost can vary, too.

In Japan, for example, it is notoriously expensive to acquire patents. In addition, the annual fees required to maintain the patents there are often prohibitively expensive for small businesses, said Gary Johnson, chief executive of Blue Spark Technologies, a manufacturer based in West Lake, Ohio, that makes small, flexible batteries used in things like radio frequency identification tags.

“What we have done is to develop a strategy to go after I.P. protection in a limited number of countries that we think we are most likely to sell or manufacture in, like the U.S. and China,” he said. “A lot of the choice comes down to what your business plan tells you.” To decide what your international I.P. strategy should be, consult a lawyer and conduct some cost-benefit analysis to see if expanding your I.P. rights makes sense.

5. People who collect patents but don’t actually make anything are “patent trolls,” parasites who can make money only by filing lawsuits against real businesses.

The term “patent troll” was coined in the wake of the epic lawsuit fought between NTP, a small holding company, and Research in Motion, which makes the hugely popular BlackBerry. The focal point of the dispute was a patent for wireless e-mail delivery held by NTP — something that R.I.M. eventually would pay millions of dollars to license. But what most people remember about the story is the lawsuits and the notion that NTP was somehow in the wrong for trying to enforce its patent, mostly because it didn’t make any products itself.

But consider that many inventors never set out to build a company, only to partner with someone who would bring their products to life. Thomas Edison, for instance, received more than 1,000 patents — many of which he licensed to other companies. “He created what we might consider the first innovation factory,” says Mark Blaxill a co-founder of 3LP Advisors, an intellectual property consulting company based in Boston.

A more recent example is Trident Design, a company founded by an inventor, Chris Hawker, which patented and then licensed the design for the PowerSquid. Like Edison, Mr. Hawker’s company invents products, builds an intellectual-property wall around them and then licenses them to other companies.

The PowerSquid is now manufactured by a division of Phillips Electronics and sold by a spinoff of Trident called Flexity. “Our entire business model is leveraging our I.P.,” Mr. Hawker said.
148 2009-08-06 Ikea’s PS (or Post Scriptum) products were introduced in 1995 as a way of promoting affordable cutting-edge design, and a new collection comes out only every few years. The most recent arrived in stores this week and includes pieces that rival Droog in ingenuity and West Elm in price.

Virka, a funky, lacy textile by Kazuyo Nomura, is a case in point. The fabric, which can be used as a curtain, room divider or accent piece, is made of polyester thread embroidered on a cellulose base. The cellulose is washed away during production, giving each sheet a gauzy, handmade look. Sheets measure 43 inches wide by 118 long, and because the fibers are stiff, they can be cut into any shape without fraying.

Available in black or white, for about $30; information: ikea.com/us/en.
149 2009-08-06 As antiques dealers, we applaud the attitude of the sisters mentioned in the article who appreciate the older, finer things of life, compared to the sterile, cold trend of much modern design.

It is too bad, however, that they feel that using corpses of animals as decorative accents is acceptable. It is sickening to see animal heads and skins used in this way. It is disrespectful to the animals and demeans the humans who use the bodies of the animals for such frivolous reasons.
150 2009-08-06 BEIJING — China’s envoy to global negotiations on climate change expressed optimism on Wednesday that a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gases would be reached this year, and he said that his nation’s efforts to curb carbon pollution already had produced results that he called “second to none.”

But the envoy, Yu Qingtai, also underscored China’s opposition to placing a ceiling on its emissions of greenhouse gases, a step that some experts have called crucial to efforts to slow global warming.

China now emits more carbon dioxide than the United States, although it remains well behind when pollutants are measured on a per-person basis. Together, China and the United States account for about 40 percent of pollutants linked to climate change.

In a briefing at China’s Foreign Ministry, Mr. Yu presented a list of Chinese achievements in limiting carbon emissions, including claims that Beijing is the world’s foremost user of nonpolluting hydropower and solar power, and fourth in wind power. By 2020, he said, 15 percent of China’s energy will come from renewable sources.

Mr. Yu also said the nation had made impressive strides in energy efficiency, reducing the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product by a tenth since 2005. The government has said it will achieve a total reduction of 20 percent by 2020, a goal Mr. Yu called “a binding target.”
151 2009-08-06 Merck and Schering-Plough agreed Wednesday to pay $41.5 million to settle class-action lawsuits that accused them of withholding unfavorable results of a clinical trial of the cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia.

The companies came under intense scrutiny in January 2008 after they released a study — completed nearly two years earlier — that showed that the medicines, the work of a joint venture, were no more effective in unclogging arteries than a pre-existing and less expensive cholesterol treatment.

Sales of Vytorin slumped 23 percent in 2008 after the data was released. Its makers suffered further damage when a second study linked the drugs to potentially harmful side effects, including cancer.

The settlement resolves more than 140 claims filed by consumers and insurers who bought, used or paid money toward the purchase of Vytorin and Zetia. The consumer settlements require court approval.

In July, the companies agreed to a separate $5.4 million payment to the attorneys general of 35 states and the District of Columbia for costs incurred in investigating consumer-protection cases involving the drugs.

Merck and Schering-Plough continued to defend their drugs’ efficacy and safety and did not acknowledge any wrongdoing or liability as part of the settlement. Merck’s general counsel, Bruce N. Kuhlik, said the settlement allowed the companies to avoid mounting legal costs.
152 2009-08-06 It must be a full moon. Some of the most beleaguered financial stocks out there suddenly soared on Wednesday — and no one could quite explain why.

The numbers were astounding, especially on a day when the broad market drifted lower. American International Group, synonymous with the financial crisis, jumped 63 — yes, 63 — percent in one day. The troubled mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shot up 30 percent.

The CIT Group, the struggling commercial lender, climbed 38 percent. And Citigroup, which has received $45 billion in government aid, rose 10 percent in one of the busiest trading days for any individual stock in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, with some two billion shares changing hands, according to Bloomberg data.

So on an otherwise slow financial news day, what drove this move? Wall Street analysts were groping for explanations. Some said investors who had bet against these stocks were rushing to buy and cover their short positions. Others pointed to trading in the options market, or speculated that high-frequency computer trading could have played a part.

“There are more people declaring that the recession’s over, but why it should create an outsize impact today makes no sense to me,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. “It’s strange. When all else fails, what can you do but say these computer programs have taken over the markets?”
153 2009-08-06 “I, as the president of the Islamic republic of Iran, swear before the holy Koran and the Iranian nation and God to be the guardian of the official religion, the Islamic republic and the Constitution,” Mr. Ahmadinejad intoned as he took the oath of office. A brief film shown before the ceremony highlighted Iran’s scientific achievements, including the cloning of sheep and the launching of the Omid satellite.

In a brief inauguration speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad made clear that he viewed his re-election as a mandate to move aggressively on a variety of issues, including plans to rebuild Iran’s troubled economy and reform the subsidies system. He also spoke contemptuously about the Western countries that had refused to congratulate him on his election victory. “No one in Iran is waiting for your congratulations,” he said. “The people of Iran care neither for your grimaces nor for your congratulations and smiles.”

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, asked about the inauguration during a news conference in Kenya, where she began a seven-nation Africa tour, said, “Engagement is still on the table with the Iranians,” though that does not mean the United States is not considering other options. She added a word of admiration for Iran’s opposition movement, saying, “We appreciate and admire the continuing resistance.”

The opposition movement persists, but in recent days the authorities have stepped up efforts to intimidate and silence it. On Tuesday, Mir Hamid Hassanzadeh, the director of Mr. Moussavi’s Web site, was arrested, Iranian news agencies reported.

Meanwhile, a mass trial of more than 100 reformists is under way. As the trial opened last weekend, some senior opposition figures were shown on state television delivering humiliating “confessions” in which they said there had been no election fraud, and detailing foreign-led plots to bring down the Iranian government with a “velvet” revolution. Such confessions are familiar from earlier trials, and defendants and human rights groups say they are almost always obtained through torture.

Prosecutors have warned that anyone questioning the legitimacy of the trial — as many opposition figures have — could in turn be prosecuted. Some senior lawmakers have hinted in recent days that Mr. Moussavi and other opposition leaders could be arrested soon, though it is impossible to tell if that is only a scare tactic.

But the opposition does not seem to have been cowed. In recent weeks, as news emerged of protesters who died in prison after being arrested, Mr. Moussavi and others spoke out more forcefully than ever before, accusing the government of savage and criminal acts. The anger spread to some prominent conservatives, prompting a number of conciliatory efforts by the government, including the release of more than 140 prisoners and the closing — at the personal order of Iran’s supreme leader — of a detention center.

Such conciliatory gestures have alternated with renewed crackdowns on street protests, as ever-larger deployments of police officers in Tehran and other cities fill the streets to intimidate and beat back protesters. The protests have continued, and the demonstrators have even adapted: in recent days, they have begun using a tactic in which they form clusters and chant antigovernment slogans, only to disperse quietly into the surrounding crowds the moment the police approach.

The authorities clearly hope that Mr. Ahmadinejad’s inauguration will put to rest the opposition’s persistent demands for an annulment of the election or a referendum on its legitimacy. But it is clear that they are concerned about the continuation of the protests in the weeks and months to come.

The opposition aside, Mr. Ahmadinejad is likely to face an array of political challenges from his own conservative rivals. A bitter dispute broke out last month when he appointed a controversial figure as his top deputy, and he was forced to back down after Ayatollah Khamenei intervened. As the president begins naming his new cabinet in the coming days, his rivals are likely to seek more concessions, bringing persistent fissures in the conservative camp to light.

159 2009-08-07 As the Lower East Side is steadily swallowed by Midtown, are there really any ’60s-style radical bohemians still to be found there? So “The Pied Pipers of the Lower East Side” would have you believe. The play, written and directed by Derek Ahonen and rendered with brassy verve by the troupe the Amoralists, has been deservedly extended at Performance Space 122, and what a long, shaggy but exhilarating three-act (and nearly three-hour) ride it is.

It kicks off in a bravura frenzy: On a sweltering day, in a bric-a-brac-strewn apartment above a vegan restaurant, the hot-tempered Wyatt (Matthew Pilieci) and the loquacious Billy (James Kautz) are having a blazing argument over a missing lottery ticket. They are joined by their roommates, the former lawyer Dear (Sarah Lemp), copper-haired, grounded and direct, who works with Wyatt downstairs; and the flighty, teenage Dawn (Mandy Nicole Moore), who sings on the streets for money.

Billy — a boozy recovering drug addict who sporadically publishes a revolutionary periodical and talks of heading to Mexico to join an insurrection — soon has a visitor: his brother, Evan (Nick Lawson), an impudent college conservative from Iowa mortified at this tribe’s ambisexual practices, startlingly apparent in an effective nude sequence. (No one under 17 is being admitted to the production.) Evan receives lectures from everyone extolling the group-love ethos of this ramshackle collective — at times the streams of dialogue approach screwball velocity — with Dawn’s proving the most persuasive.

But this is no mere culture clash. The arrival of Donovan (Charles Meola), a crass millionaire with ties to the apartment and a proposition, reveals an underside to the group’s identity. Therein lies the play’s principal charm: the unwitting self-deceptions of the characters, for all their idealism. It is left to the vigorous cast members to sustain their appeal — and they do, despite the defects.

An Amoralist mission statement claims to forgo moral judgments, and yet, by the end, it’s disheartening to discover that the director-playwright has seen fit largely to betray these utopian dreamers to the Establishment.

175 2009-08-07 Donald Marshall Jr., a Mi’kmaq Indian whose wrongful conviction for murder became a cause célèbre in Canada, leading to a sweeping re-examination of Nova Scotia’s legal system and changes in Canada’s evidence disclosure rules, died Thursday in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

He was 55 and lived in Membertou, Nova Scotia.

His sister, Roseanne Sylvester, confirmed his death, telling The Canadian Press that he suffered from kidney failure, which she linked to antirejection drugs he had been taking since a double lung transplant six years ago.

Late on the night of May 28, 1971, Mr. Marshall and a friend, Sandy Seale, went walking in a Sydney park and had an encounter with an older man, Roy Ebsary, who drew a knife and killed Mr. Seale. Disregarding Mr. Ebsary as a suspect, the police decided that Mr. Marshall, known to them from previous run-ins, had killed his friend in an unexplained fit of rage. A jury agreed, and Mr. Marshall began serving a life sentence.

He was released from prison in 1982 after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reviewed his case, and a year later the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal declared him not guilty of the murder. In its ruling, however, the court stated that Mr. Marshall was “the author of his own misfortune” and that there had been no miscarriage of justice.

A royal commission of inquiry later criticized that finding as “a serious and fundamental error.” In a seven-volume report delivered in 1990, it said police incompetence and “systemic racism” infecting the police department, the court system, the government bureaucracy and even Mr. Marshall’s own lawyers were to blame for the conviction.
176 2009-08-07 Then the game began. That’s right. The game. The Yankees were playing their rivals, the Red Sox, on the first visit by David Ortiz since recent revelations that he was on a list of ball players who tested positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs in 2003.

Yankee fans have been saying, Nyah, nyah, I told you so, since the news was revealed in The New York Times. Many of them had been convinced Ortiz had to be doping because of the ridges on his head, or the home runs he was suddenly smiting.

But on this day of Sotomayor’s confirmation and Ali’s visit, Big Papi did not stir up much anger, or even make-believe anger. Big Papi made a pro-active strike, bellying up to the rail to sign autographs and pose for photographs with fans in Red Sox gear or striped Yankee jerseys.

Classic Big Papi, the man of the people. Hard to boo a fellow like that, or even stick out the tongue between the lips and make the razzing sound long associated with the Bronx.

To be sure, the Outdoor A Cappella Choir of the Right-Field Bleachers did come up with some vocal raspberries for the Red Sox and emit a flurry of boos when Papi was introduced in the starting lineup.

But the response was nothing like the yowling vengeance-is-ours tone of e-mail messages from Yankee fans in recent weeks, celebrating the news about Ortiz. Maybe people who pay these prices psychologically check their anger at the gate, along with their water bottles. Or maybe it’s hard to hate Big Papi in person, when he presses the flesh.

This is one savvy Papi. He put his arm around Brendan Bernstein, 15, from Westport, Conn., who was wearing his unmistakable Yankee jersey. Somebody snapped a photo of Papi and Brendan, who decided that Papi was a good guy.

There was another photo op with Danni Schifter of San Diego, visiting New York with her fiancé, a Red Sox fan. This was her first time in Yankee Stadium, new or old, and she said Yankee fans seemed pretty nice to her.

Big Papi did hear some boos at 7:17 p.m. when he batted with two men on and two outs, but it pretty much died out before he dug in his spikes. He then stepped out of the box, perhaps to upset young Joba Chamberlain, and a few fans booed his tactic, but then he lofted a foul fly that was caught down the right-field line.

It did not get any better for Papi. He hit into a double play in the third with two on, he flied out in the fifth with two on, and he popped up in the sixth with two on. There was only one runner on in the eighth when he was thrown out by Robinson Cano from the outfield grass.

Yankee fans took some delight in that, but mostly they enjoyed seeing their team finally beat the Red Sox, 13-6, after losing eight straight this season. By the end of this long game, Big Papi’s possible transgressions were old business, leftover cranky e-mailings at odd hours.

So maybe it’s not about drugs, after all. Maybe most fans don’t care what athletes put in their bodies as long as they dive head first against the walls to catch a pop-up. The grumps are pretty much perceived as grumps and the extroverts make it easy for themselves. Cheating is a separate issue, and apparently not one for a soft summer night.
177 2009-08-07 WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. missile strike in Pakistan’s tribal areas on Wednesday may have killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the country’s fearsome Taliban militia, American and Pakistani officials said Thursday.

Officials in Washington and Islamabad were scrambling to make sense of communications intercepts and other intelligence that seemed to indicate that Mr. Mehsud might have been killed in the strike. By Thursday evening, American officials said they were growing increasingly confident that the Taliban leader was dead.

Still, they cautioned that it may be weeks before they are certain, and they may never gain access to the remote location in South Waziristan to perform DNA tests.

“There is reason to believe that reports of his death may be true, but it can’t be confirmed at this time,” said an American official with access to classified intelligence reports.

Mr. Mehsud and his military network have been blamed for a wave of violence across Pakistan, including the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister.
178 2009-08-07 Some experts say propofol abuse is spreading because unlike many prescription drugs, it is not a federally controlled substance. A 2007 survey of the country’s 126 anesthesiology resident training programs found that 71 percent did not secure it in a pharmacy or track its dispensing.

Two years ago, a petition urged the to restrict it as a controlled substance. A spokesman for the agency said it was still evaluating whether potential abuse outweighs the benefits of easy accessibility for doctors.

Propofol’s benefits have made it one of the most widely used anesthetics. It wears off quickly, leaves no grogginess or nausea and is not believed to be physically addictive. A white liquid doctors refer to as “milk of ,” the drug is liked by abusers because it induces relaxation or sleep, can cause mild euphoria, sexual fantasies or sexual disinhibition upon waking and leaves the bloodstream so quickly it is difficult to detect.

But propofol can be extremely dangerous if not constantly monitored as it is in because it can slow breathing or lower to the point of death. Its effects become compounded by other drugs in a person’s system. Abusers who inject it often pass out instantly, sometimes getting injured; the Nebraska doctor said he fell once and “cut my chin open.” He also started “talking gibberish” and “didn’t remember doing certain things.”

At Talbott Recovery Campus in , an addiction treatment program, medical professionals who listed propofol among the drugs they were taking grew to 27 in 2008 from 8 in 2006, or 8 percent of those in the program, said Dr. Paul H. Earley, Talbott’s medical director.

“I think the number of deaths is well above what’s been reported,” said Dr. Robert R. Kirby, an emeritus professor of anesthesiology at the College of Medicine, and a co-author of a recent journal article on propofol abuse.

The 2007 survey found 18 percent of the training programs reported cases of propofol abuse among employees or trainees, including seven deaths. While the numbers were small compared with other prescription drugs, the results were significantly higher than 10 years earlier.

Using propofol as a home sleep aid — as it might have been administered to Mr. Jackson — would be “kind of like me using so I don’t have to shave my head,” said Dr. John F. Dombrowski, director of the Pain Center and a board member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.. “You’d never do that.”

, which makes branded propofol called Diprivan, says on its packaging that self-administration has rarely resulted in death and suggests restricted access.

Some cases of nonmedical abuse have been recorded, including one man who reportedly bought propofol on . And the Nebraska doctor saw people dripping it from an IV a decade ago at a rave party. Others use a syringe for quick bursts of relaxation or instant naps between long, stressful hospital shifts.

“Someone can go to a bathroom, inject a small amount and recover five minutes later,” Dr. Kirby said. One doctor-in-training at an East Coast hospital injected himself up to 100 times a day to relieve “his stress, his loneliness, boredom,” said Dr. Paul E. Wischmeyer, a professor of anesthesiology at the , , School of Medicine, who conducted the 2007 survey.

When he could not find it on hospital carts, he would reach into boxes of needles discarded during surgery with “remaining propofol in it and stick himself with those,” Dr. Wischmeyer said, adding that the man risked contamination with patients’ infections.

Dr. Earley said people drawn to propofol seem to have histories of “physical or sexual trauma,” which, he said, “makes sense because the drug really produces this dissociative state — you’re disconnected from yourself.” Dr. Omar S. Manejwala, associate medical director of the Farley Center, an addiction treatment program in where propofol cases are increasing, said addiction is possible and “more complex to treat because there are other co-occurring conditions like .”

Even in hospitals with controls, abuse can occur. Last year, a nurse in Gainesville, Fla., was convicted of killing a 24-year-old college student in 2005 with propofol injections.

Introduced about 20 years ago, propofol quickly “revolutionized” medicine, Dr. Dombrowski said, replacing sodium pentathol, whose side effects included nausea. Propofol is used for , surgery on hips and broken bones and , where Mr. Jackson might have been given it.

Dr. Ken Elmassian, an anesthesiologists’ society board member and a physician at Ingham Regional Medical Center in Lansing, Mich., said patients had begun paying attention to the anesthetic they were getting, saying, “ ‘Oh, you mean the drug that Michael Jackson got?’ ”

Ultimately, without proper training, it is virtually impossible to gauge the right amount to use.

“You can be a little floaty and high, followed by being asleep, followed by stopping breathing, and the window between those stages is a very small quantity of the drug, and it’s not predictable,” Dr. Earley said. “Using it by yourself is Russian roulette.”

After his car crash, the Nebraska anesthesiologist, a father of four, spent 90 days at the Talbott addiction center and was disciplined by his state medical board. He was allowed to return to administering propofol in the operating room two months ago. He is monitored by counselors and takes daily drug tests, although propofol, experts point out, leaves the system too quickly for detection.

“I have these big thoughts that pop up — ‘Oh, that would feel relaxing’ — but never a craving like I want to go home and use that,” he said.

Still, he sees its use among other doctors. Just a week after returning from rehab, he attended the funeral of a colleague “I never would have dreamed was using it,” the doctor said. “He had overdosed on propofol.”
179 2009-08-07 After the debut of the Asphalt Orchestra at Lincoln Center on Wednesday, one thing was clear: marching bands have come a long way since the days of “Seventy-Six Trombones.”

An iconoclastic 12-piece marching band, the Asphalt Orchestra was the brainchild of Bang on a Can, the collective of composers and performers devoted to boundary-blurring new music. Despite the threat of rain on a muggy night, the courtyard outside the renovated Alice Tully Hall was packed with people, including lots of families with small children, for the free event.

Part parade spectacle, part halftime show and part cutting-edge contemporary-music concert, the performance, presented by Lincoln Center Out of Doors, began in the sunken area before the entrance to Tully Hall. From there, the 12 top-notch brass and percussion players in the band, like a posse of pied pipers, led the throng across West 65th Street to the new grove of trees in front of the Lincoln Center Theater, then across Lincoln Center Plaza to the central fountain, which is under reconstruction, and finally to the area in front of the Metropolitan Opera.

The music was an exhilarating half-hour of five gritty, wailing or perky pieces, everything from Balkan brass music to an earthy work by the jazz giant Charles Mingus. The playing was coolly brilliant and infectious. And what a scene!

As crowds sat on the steps outside Tully Hall, the band marched in from around the corner playing “Carlton,” a commissioned work by Heidi Rodewald and Stew, who wrote the musical “Passing Strange” and perform in the rock band the Negro Problem. As the band marched, the players executed nimble moves choreographed by Susan Marshall, no less, a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.
180 2009-08-07 CHICAGO — Top officials at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated shadow admissions process for applicants who were supported by politicians, donors and other prominent sponsors, a state commission set up to investigate irregularities at the institution concluded Thursday.

In a scathing report, the commission informed Gov. Patrick J. Quinn that the state’s flagship university was in a “full-fledged crisis purely of its own making,” the result of a widespread culture of “cynicism and crass opportunism” that went back a decade or more, and that the overall scheme was “perhaps unparalleled among universities in its level of formality and structure.”

The former dean of the College of Law, the dean of the College of Business, and high-ranking officials at the undergraduate college like President B. Joseph White, Chancellor Richard Herman and Associate Provost Keith Marshall, are named in the report as participating in or encouraging the admission of privileged but sometimes unqualified applicants.

In an October 2006 e-mail message quoted in the report, for example, a college dean informed the admissions director of one student, saying: “Given his father’s donor status, I may be asking you to admit him. We are about to launch a huge campaign, and we can’t be alienating big donors by rejecting their kids.”

Mr. Quinn, a Democrat, set up the commission, an independent seven-member panel, in June to review admissions at the university after The Chicago Tribune reported that hundreds of applicants won acceptance at the intervention of well-placed family members or friends. The commission confirmed many of the newspaper’s accusations and shed new light on how deeply entrenched “a deal-making mindset, said to be reflective of the state’s political culture, seeped into parts of this university.”

The shadow admissions process was known among officials as Category I. According to testimony from hearings, internal documents and e-mail messages released to the panel, university officials fretted about the university’s decline in national rankings as a result of the poor student admissions even as they encouraged the special treatment.
181 2009-08-07 The strategy is pretty clear: almost every piece in the exhibition, whatever its form — and there is a great variety of formal approaches —pertains to a social issue. Race, ethnicity, identity, immigration, ancestry, disenfranchisement and globalization are among the themes represented, and if they are not immediately discernible in the works themselves, wall labels helpfully explain. Call it Postmodern Social Realism Lite.

The show’s diversity is mildly engaging. Organized by curators from four departments — arts of Africa, decorative arts, arts of Asia and American art — it includes paintings, sculpture, video, jewelry, ceramics, textiles and more. Except for Martin Puryear, represented by a powerful, intricately built wooden sculpture, and Bill Viola, by a portentous but nevertheless haunting two-part video of a man and a woman submerged in water, there are no famous artists, and none of the usual darlings of the international scene are included. No Nauman, no Koons, no Bourgeois. That may be to the curators’ credit. Or it may say something about budgetary constraints.

What is irksome is the relentless didacticism of the artworks and the curatorial commentary. In Willie Cole’s “Stowage,” a big woodcut print, the schematic image of an ironing board is surrounded by the imprints of iron soleplates. Reducing metaphor to illustration, the wall label explains that this alludes to the “domestic work of Cole’s slave ancestors” and to “diagrams once made of slave ships and their tightly packed human cargo.”

In a handsome ceramic bowl by Diego Romero, the humorous image of Mayans building a pyramid out of Big Macs is, says the wall label, “a nod to both the lost glory of the Mayan civilization and the modern-day influence of fast food on Native American health.” That is a good lesson in how to ruin a joke.

The issues raised by various works are compellingly urgent, and in some cases they are treated with a moving directness. A dress made by an unknown tailor for the Malian actress Fatoumata Coulibaly advertises her campaign against female circumcision with the words “My daughter will not be excised” in French and Bamana, integrated into the pattern of the fabric. Video portraits by Sue Williamson, in which men and women tell stories of difficulties they’ve undergone in South Africa, are heartbreaking.

But however convincing any given work may be, the general message is problematic because it takes the value of art to be in its sociopolitical content rather than in its visual and formal dimensions. “Sell Me Something Brown,” an array of brown objects by Franco Mondini-Ruiz resembling a sidewalk merchant’s display, is charmingly absurd. It includes pieces of fake food, ceramic knickknacks, baskets and other objects that he purchased while traveling. The wall label explains that it is about the “ ‘cultural’ peddler who exoticizes his own culture for profit,” which is reasonable but deflates the wacky poetry and obscures the play with serial sculpture and the Duchampian found object.

Most of the artists are more or less complicit in this conceptually flat-footed way of thinking. One side of Chunghie Lee’s “Pojagi,” a panel of fabric just over two feet square, is a beautiful, neatly stitched patchwork of colored swatches, a contemporary version of a kind of wrapping cloth traditionally made by Korean women. It is a pleasure to come upon something so purely visually gratifying.

Then you discover, on the reverse, ghostly silk-screened images of women in 19th-century Korean costumes: a disappointingly literal statement about ancestry and modernity. It’s enough to make you yearn for Damien Hirst’s shark in a tank.

So how well do an exhibition and a collection that favor social and cultural content over unpredictable forms, images and metaphors serve Newark? Maybe some visitors will be taken with the relevance of such works to their lived experience and will want to learn more about art. At best, they will be inspired to journey across the river to Manhattan to explore a more expansive landscape of museums and galleries and see how much more exciting, strange and consciousness-altering contemporary art can be.
182 2009-08-07 Early figures for 2009 appear to confirm the correlation with the recession. As more families were feeling the effects of layoffs and economic uncertainty, births decreased even faster.

In Arizona, births declined about 3 percent in 2008, the first annual decrease since an economic downturn in 1991. In the first six months of 2009, 7 percent fewer babies were born compared with the year before. The state’s population bubble burst and the jobless rate rose from 5.5 percent to 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending in June.

In the first three months of 2009, births also declined 7 percent in Florida, another state where the economy took a tumble.

“It may be that many couples saw it coming,” said Carl Haub, senior demographer for the Population Reference Bureau.

Stephanie Coontz, a professor at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and research director for the Council on Contemporary Families, a research and advocacy group, said, “We probably can’t prove it yet, but I agree.”

“That’s what happened in the Great Depression,” Professor Coontz said, “and although in some periods since then, we have sometimes seen women decide to have a baby if they get laid off, that decision is usually only made if the husband is working and his job seems secure.

“More than 80 percent of the job losses in this recession have been borne by men,” Professor Coontz added. “There are a lot of families where a maternity leave would mean that no income at all was coming in.”

Historically, birth rates have fluctuated with the economy. Record lows were recorded during two economic crises: the Depression in the 1930s and the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s.

By the 1970s, birth rates were also affected by the rise of feminism and easier access to contraceptives and to abortion. But would they have dropped as low as they did, Mr. Haub asked, without “the added impetus of inflation, not to mention long lines at the gas station?”

“While that question can never be definitively answered,” he said, “we do know that the economic setting hardly seems conducive to starting families or having additional children. Double-digit inflation during the 1970s made two-earner, two-career families a virtual necessity for many.”

Stephanie J. Ventura, chief of the reproductive statistics branch of the National Center for Health Statistics, said, “We’ve had these bumps and drops in the past, but 2009 will be critical.”

Mr. Haub agreed. “If the economic crisis can be given a start date of early 2008,” he said, “then evidence of a slump in the birth rate might become apparent as early as late 2008, but could not be really conclusive until well into 2009.”

“It is certainly too soon to tell if this economic crisis will result in a sharp drop in the birth rate,” he said, “but all the measures and indicators, along with the collapse of the mainstays of the economy, are much worse than in the 1970s.”

In 2006 and 2007, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recorded a birth rate of 14.3 per thousand people. That number declined to 13.9 in 2008 (most sharply near the end of the year).

The fertility rate among women 15-to-44 years old, which rose from 68.7 per 1,000 in 2006 to 69.2 in 2007, dipped to 68.4 in 2008.
183 2009-08-07 Re “A New School Leader in New York” (editorial, July 30):

David Steiner’s appointment as state education commissioner provides New York with a fresh opportunity to fulfill its moral and constitutional obligation of providing all students with a quality education.

Commissioner Steiner faces a number of challenges, including the threat of another round of state budget cuts. Since the Campaign for Fiscal Equity lawsuit was filed in 1993, parent and community organizations have demanded that the state provide full and fair financing plus enhanced accountability. In this fiscal crisis, the state has not met its financing commitments.

The bully pulpit of the commissioner has been important in articulating the need for full and equitable financing. The new commissioner’s leadership is also needed to provide greater transparency and require school districts to treat parents as important partners.

Fair financing combined with accountability is the formula for school improvement.

It’s heartening to learn that the Board of Regents has selected David Steiner to be the new state commissioner of education. In terms of in-school reform, nothing is more important than the training of new and current teachers, and Mr. Steiner has already put into practice a new model for doing so.
184 2009-08-07 Ernie Paragallo, a prominent New York thoroughbred breeder and owner who was already facing 22 counts of animal cruelty, was indicted Thursday on 35 counts in all by a Greene County grand jury that found he continued to neglect his horses.

Paragallo’s Center Brook Farm in Climax, N.Y., was raided in April, and he was charged with 22 counts of animal cruelty after the New York State Police and the Humane Society/Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Greene and Columbia Counties found that many of his more than 170 horses were malnourished.

Paragallo, 51, will be arraigned Aug. 18. He is free on $5,000 bail.

“Obviously we are disappointed,” Paragallo’s lawyer, Michael Howard, said by e-mail. “A trial will bring out more of the evidence, and the people will have a much more difficult time proving their case.”

The additional charges on which the grand jury indicted Paragallo were based in part on 11 horses that were intended for slaughter but were saved from the kill pen by two horse rescue groups in March. The other two new counts stemmed from two horses that were euthanized after the raid because Paragallo refused to properly feed or care for them even though he was ordered to do so, the authorities said.

Paragallo has denied that the remaining horses have been neglected and said that the S.P.C.A. and state authorities had no basis for the original charges.
185 2009-08-07 In addition to the blockbuster election-law case, the new term is frontloaded with important First Amendment, business, criminal and patent cases. Justice Sotomayor’s early votes and opinions, along with alliances she forges, will provide answers to at least some of the questions she avoided in confirmation hearings.

But Supreme Court specialists said they do not expect her to take a fundamentally different approach from Justice Souter, whom she is succeeding, in most kinds of cases. They also cautioned that a justice’s first few years are often a poor indicator of a long-term philosophy.

“Few justices write broadly or stake out new terrain in their first terms,” said Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at who served as a law clerk to Justice .

“The Supreme Court is an intimate group of equals who will live together for years,” Professor Pildes added. “Most newcomers tread gently as they come to terms with the dynamics of the group and a daunting array of new issues, including questions lower court judges never face, such as how bound to be by prior Supreme Court decisions. The cases are harder, the ramifications of decisions far more consequential.”

For Justice Sotomayor, the new job will start with hearing the election-law case Citizens United v. . It concerns whether the government may limit the showing of a negative documentary about under the campaign finance laws, and it attracted only limited attention when it was first argued in March.

In an unusual move in June, though, the court set the case down for re-argument on Sept. 9, asking the parties to address the question of whether it should overrule a foundational decision about the regulation of corporate speech and part of a decision upholding the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.

Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the , said Citizens United is “one of the most important First Amendment cases in years.”

“It has,” Mr. Chemerinsky added, “the potential for dramatically changing all federal, state and local elections if the court holds that corporations have a First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates.”

The docket is also studded with business cases, and the decisions in them will provide hints about how the court will treat disputes arising from economic legislation pushed through Congress by the Obama administration.

“The Supreme Court,” said Joseph A. Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford, “will likely issue important decisions defining the permissible level of punitive damages, the validity of business method patents, whether and when parallel conduct among competitors violates the antitrust laws, and statutes of limitations in securities fraud action. But who the heck knows how Justice Sotomayor will vote in any of these cases?”

A former prosecutor, district and appellate court judge, she has a more fully developed record on criminal issues. Her views are in some ways more conservative than those of Justice Souter, meaning that this is an area where her vote may make a difference.

“I would have expected her to have voted against subjecting scientific experts to cross-examination,” said Craig M. Bradley, a law professor at , referring to a 5-to-4 decision from the court in June. The decision, with Justice Souter in the majority, ruled that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination.

The court has agreed to hear a follow-up case, and the new justice will have to consider whether to narrow the scope of the decision from June, Melendez-Diaz v. .

A pair of cases concerning whether the Constitution allows juvenile offenders to be sentenced to life without parole for crimes in which no one was killed will also illuminate Justice Sotomayor’s views on harsh punishments. They may also answer a question not fully resolved at her confirmation hearings, that of whether she will look to the decision of foreign courts in considering the issue, as the court did in barring the execution of juvenile offenders in 2005.

The lower courts in the two new cases, both from , had no difficulty ruling against the inmates who brought them. The courts said they were bound by Supreme Court precedent. But the Supreme Court itself is free to alter or reinterpret its precedent.

Justice , who served for more than 30 years and who wielded his charm and intellect to forge sometimes unlikely liberal majorities, said there was no way to get ready for such a task.

“I say categorically that no prior experience, including prior judicial experience, prepares one for the work of the Supreme Court,” Justice Brennan wrote in 1973. “The initial confrontation on the with the astounding differences in function and character of role, and the necessity for learning entirely new criteria for decisions, can be a traumatic experience for the neophyte.”
186 2009-08-07 Comcast, the cable TV systems operator, posted a 53 percent increase in second-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher prices and increased customer spending on video and Internet services.

But the recession slowed subscriber growth significantly and local advertising remained depressed.

Comcast, based in Philadelphia, earned $967 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter that ended June 30, compared with $632 million, or 21 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Revenue rose by 4.5 percent, to $8.94 billion, from $8.55 billion, helped by more customer sign-ups and higher prices.

The performance exceeded the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who were expecting earnings of 26 cents a share and revenue of $8.86 billion, on average.

Comcast resumed its share buyback program in the quarter, spending $215 million to repurchase 15.5 million shares. Shares closed down a penny at $15.05.
187 2009-08-07 Months later, when it became clear that the mass was growing and not shrinking, her husband suggested she see a surgeon. “I thought I could take care of it,” she said to me, recalling the sequence of events, “but I guess not.”

Little could have prepared me for what I saw when Marla opened her gown. While the right side of her chest was unremarkable, her left breast was the size of a young child’s head. The skin was stretched thin, and I could see an outline of the tumor within. That tumor was so large and so heavy that it seemed to pull the rest of her body down. Marla hunched over oddly and cradled her left arm not out of habit but to support the weight of the cancer within her breast.

We admitted Marla immediately to the hospital and removed her cancer the next day. Fortunately, the tumor was not an aggressive one, but her operation was far more extensive and fraught with risks than it would have been two years earlier. And as much as I liked Marla personally and enjoyed our conversations, I was also frustrated that she hadn’t come forth sooner with some doctor about her cancer.

Marla was not the first patient I had seen who had waited until her cancer was advanced before seeing the doctor. But I have learned over the years that while my initial reaction is always to question if I or any other doctor missed the diagnosis, the situation is not always so cut and dry. While I need to understand and respect the beliefs of my patients, I still can’t escape feeling a certain level of responsibility as a doctor. I find myself wondering when it comes to patients like Marla or others whose diagnoses are delayed for various personal, social and economic reasons, how responsible am I as the physician and are they as the patients?

Diagnostic failures, or diagnoses that are delayed or in error, are an increasingly popular topic of research in patient safety. While some researchers have focused on the role of doctors — are there flaws in the way they think? are “gut reactions” reliable? — others have looked at the steps involved in care, or the process of care. What has emerged most recently from this latter group of studies is that diagnostic failures are often due to missed steps, so-called “process of care lapses,” that stem from both doctors and patients.

In the June issue of The Journal of General Internal Medicine, for example, investigators from Harvard Medical School studied the records of over 100 women with breast cancer diagnosed late or at advanced stages and found that roughly a quarter of patients had experienced process of care lapses. Examples of such lapses included inadequate physical exams, delayed physician involvement and incomplete diagnostic and laboratory tests. But while the investigators discovered that nearly 20 percent of the women were missing as many as two or more steps in their care, they also found that doctors and patients contributed equally to the resulting diagnostic failures.

“Clearly we found that about half of the process failures were due to something the patient did,” said Dr. Saul N. Weingart, lead author of the study and a practicing internist and vice-president of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “These patients missed their mammogram appointments or never went to see the specialists their primary care physicians had recommended.”

To address these lapses, experts in the field of patient safety like Dr. Weingart have proposed a variety of strategies to strengthen patient follow-up. One strategy that many physicians already use in one form or another is a “tickler system,” electronic or paper reminders to check that diagnostic testing or referrals are completed. Other ways include implementing a type of technology that allows physicians to check specific tests across their entire practice, or panel, on a monthly basis. With “the push of a button,” a doctor can see which patients have not yet followed through, for example, on their mammogram appointments.

And perhaps just as important as any technological change is one that involves transforming deep-rooted practice patterns. “It’s not part of practices now,” Dr. Weingart said, “but you can imagine creating an expectation among the medical community where if patients don’t go, the referring doctors or practices will notify you.”

But there are hidden obstacles in care as well. When Dr. Weingart and his co-investigators looked more closely at the group of individuals who had experienced lapses, they found that many were patients who were particularly vulnerable: they were minorities, possessed less education and came from challenging socioeconomic backgrounds, all of which contributed to practical obstacles or poor health literacy.

These findings “suggest that there are some intangible barriers,” Dr. Weingart remarked. “Perhaps these patients don’t know how to access care, need an interpreter, live farther away, or may be overwhelmed by family responsibilities. All of these factors are distractions for a patient and make getting care all that much harder.”

In order to address these intangible barriers, Dr. Weingart suggested that “we need to develop not only risk assessment tools but also services geared toward patient vulnerabilities.” But given that many physician practices, particularly those in the community, are already overstretched, organizing and maintaining such services may be close to or simply impossible. “Often when I talk to community practices about these findings,” Dr. Weingart added, “the doctors will tell me that they can only do so much. When a patient doesn’t show up, do I have to track him or her down? How many letters do I have to send the patient? What constitutes due diligence?”

How much responsibility, then, do doctors — and patients — bear in diagnostic failures?

“I don’t think it’s 50-50,” Dr. Weingart reflected, “and I also don’t think it’s 100-zero. I think there’s a shared responsibility. But given that the patients who fall through the cracks are usually the least resourceful and most vulnerable, there is at least a moral obligation for clinicians and health care systems to provide a robust safety net for these patients.

“I think we physicians need to support patient responsibility, but we also need to get our own house in order first. In terms of process failures, we need to make sure that the current system under health care providers is airtight. After we get that figured out, we then need to think about ways to help our patients do what they need to do.”

188 2009-08-07 The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that it would begin policing the petroleum industry with penalties for anyone trying to manipulate energy prices.

The rule, which will go into effect in November, is aimed at anyone dealing with crude oil, gasoline and petroleum distillates. It prohibits market distortions through false or misleading statements about stockpiles, prices or crude and fuel output.

“This new rule will allow us to crack down on fraud and manipulation that can drive up prices at the pump,” the agency chairman, Jon Leibowitz, said in a statement.

The F.T.C. will monitor inventory reports from petroleum refiners that can affect prices.

The rule does not aim at speculators, which also have been blamed for volatile energy prices. A different agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to decide whether to place trading limits on speculators later this year.

190 2009-08-08 Shareholders of both Merck and Schering-Plough were nearly unanimous in voting on Friday to support a merger of the two drug makers. By acquiring the smaller Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion, Merck, the world’s eighth-biggest drug maker in terms of prescription medicine sales, will jump to No. 2 worldwide, just behind Pfizer. The new Merck would have about $42.4 billion in annual sales. The companies already are partners on the blockbuster cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia. Schering-Plough’s sizable biotech unit will help Merck’s sagging drug development pipeline. The new company expects to slash costs — including roughly 15,000 jobs — to maintain profit as the industry deals with increasing competition from generics and the unknown impact of health care reform. The deal still needs approval from the regulators in the United States and elsewhere.
191 2009-08-08 Murphy, who started the season as an outfielder, has seen extended time at first base since Carlos Delgado was sidelined in May. He has shown improvement lately, both at the plate and in the field.

Murphy has batted .313 over the last 17 games, raising his average to .253, and has a seven-game hitting streak.

Murphy, who has worked with the coaches Sandy Alomar Sr. and Luis Alicea, said the biggest adjustment in the field has been finding the bag with his foot as the ball arrives.

“I feel like I’ve come a long way,” Murphy said. “But I have a long way to go.”

Murphy’s lack of power — he has seven home runs in 357 plate appearances — is not necessarily an impediment at a traditional power spot if the Mets, who have the fewest homers in baseball, can pick that up at other spots.

Though building a roster is a job for Minaya, who will leave here Sunday to begin touring the Mets’ minor league affiliates, the decision to look at players like Murphy and Parnell belongs to Manuel.

“It’s all my crazy ideas,” Manuel said.

Minaya said his role is no different than it has been.

“The general manager always wants to make sure the bigger picture plans are involved,” Minaya said.

Manuel acknowledged that he has a tricky balancing act. While giving certain players auditions, he still wants the Mets to play like a team.

“You can’t let that get out of hand where it becomes an individual mindset,” Manuel said. “At some point, too, you want them to blossom in that form and fashion to fit into winning baseball. It’s definitely a tough challenge. No question about it.”

Manuel said it helped to look at players before rosters are expanded because it allowed for a truer test.

“It’s dangerous to do that in September and spring training, which sometimes we have the tendency to do,” Manuel said. “I’m as guilty as anybody.”

Opportunities for the Mets to look toward the future are not as abundant as they might have thanks to injuries to the top outfield prospect Fernando Martinez and pitchers Fernando Nieve and Niese.

The Mets had planned on looking at Parnell, whose pitches have reached 100 miles per hour, as a starter during winter ball, but when Niese, who had replaced Nieve, tore his hamstring Wednesday against St. Louis, a spot opened in the rotation.

With the team far from contention, Manuel considered Parnell’s role as a setup man — he had allowed two runs in his last 16 1/3 innings — less meaningful than the experience of starting.

Manuel said Parnell’s future role, as either a closer or a starter, had yet to be determined.

“He has power and it appears he has a level of comfort here at the big leagues,” Manuel said. “We’re just trying to see what we have in him.”

Minaya said the team’s payroll, which is about $140 million this season, has not been discussed for next season. Despite the crippling effect of the economy, he anticipated having whatever money is necessary.

“Ever since I’ve been here, I’ve never been restrained,” Minaya said.

Gary Sheffield (hamstring) and Luis Castillo (ankle) were out of the starting lineup Friday night. Jerry Manuel said he hoped to have Castillo back on Sunday but was not sure about Sheffield, who tested his leg Thursday. ... The push for offense over defense played out in the lineup Friday — with Castillo out, Manuel opted to play Fernando Tatis, who is batting .325 with two homers over his last 11 games, at second base ahead of the newly acquired Anderson Hernandez, who is strong defensively. ... Mike Pelfrey, whose wife gave birth to their first child Thursday, will fly to Arizona on Sunday, a day ahead of his scheduled start against the Diamondbacks.
192 2009-08-08 Good news from the waters of Chesapeake Bay is a rarity, especially when it concerns oysters — the basis of a once-flourishing but now nearly defunct fishery. Over the years, the Chesapeake — a broad, shallow estuary — has become contaminated by agricultural and other polluted runoff from the dozens of rivers and creeks that feed it, wreaking havoc on water quality and aquatic life. This, plus overfishing, has virtually destroyed a species that helped filter and cleanse the bay’s water.

So it comes as a welcome surprise to learn that scientists working near the mouth of Virginia’s Great Wicomico River have established surprisingly healthy beds of native oysters. The experiment, which began in 2004, uses broad, tall beds of oyster shells as artificial reefs for new oyster seedlings. The height of the reefs — a foot or more — raises the new oysters above the sediment, which seems to improve their health. The reefs are big, some as much as 20 acres in size. Scientists believe that this, too, is important to reproduction.

These experimental oyster cities — 185 million oysters on about 80 acres total — are believed to contain the largest re-established population of native oyster species in the world. Scientists think they could be a model for experiments elsewhere.

One big question is whether these reefs help protect oysters from disease. But if they work as well as they seem to, the reefs offer enormous promise. They also present an enormous engineering problem — how to build them over tens of thousands of acres, re-creating a time when the Chesapeake was paved with oysters.
193 2009-08-08 We have become so accustomed to living in a society saturated with misogyny that the barbaric treatment of women and girls has come to be more or less expected.

We profess to being shocked at one or another of these outlandish crimes, but the shock wears off quickly in an environment in which the , murder and humiliation of females is not only a staple of the news, but an important cornerstone of the nation’s entertainment.

The mainstream culture is filled with the most gruesome forms of misogyny, and pornography is now a multibillion-dollar industry — much of it controlled by mainstream U.S. corporations.

One of the striking things about mass killings in the U.S. is how consistently we find that the killers were riddled with shame and sexual humiliation, which they inevitably blamed on women and girls. The answer to their feelings of inadequacy was to get their hands on a gun (or guns) and begin blowing people away.

What was unusual about Sodini was how explicit he was in his blog about his personal shame and his hatred of women. “Why do this?” he asked. “To young girls? Just read below.” In his gruesome, monthslong rant, he managed to say, among other things: “It seems many teenage girls have sex frequently. One 16 year old does it usually three times a day with her boyfriend. So, err, after a month of that, this little [expletive] has had more sex than ME in my LIFE, and I am 48. One more reason.”

I was reminded of the gunman, , who killed 32 people in a rampage at the university in 2007. While Cho shot males as well as females, he was reported to have previously stalked female classmates and to have leaned under tables to take inappropriate photos of women. A former roommate said Cho once claimed to have seen “promiscuity” when he looked into the eyes of a woman on campus.

Soon after the Virginia Tech slayings, I interviewed Dr. James Gilligan, who spent many years studying violence as a prison psychiatrist in and as a professor at Harvard and “What I’ve concluded from decades of working with murderers and rapists and every kind of violent criminal,” he said, “is that an underlying factor that is virtually always present to one degree or another is a feeling that one has to prove one’s manhood, and that the way to do that, to gain the respect that has been lost, is to commit a violent act.”

Life in the is mind-bogglingly violent. But we should take particular notice of the staggering amounts of violence brought down on the nation’s women and girls each and every day for no other reason than who they are. They are attacked because they are female.

A girl or woman somewhere in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every couple of minutes or so. The number of seriously battered wives and girlfriends is far beyond the ability of any agency to count.

There were so many sexual attacks against women in the armed forces that the Defense Department had to revise its entire approach to the problem.

We would become much more sane, much healthier, as a society if we could bring ourselves to acknowledge that misogyny is a serious and pervasive problem, and that the twisted way so many men feel about women, combined with the absurdly easy availability of guns, is a toxic mix of the most tragic proportions.
194 2009-08-08 A Tibetan university student who had written a book in support of the Tibetan uprising of 2008 and edited a banned literary magazine has disappeared, according to a Tibet advocacy group based in Washington. The student, Tashi Rabten, has not been seen since July 26, the advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet, said Thursday. The advocacy group said Tashi Rabten, who is from Sichuan Province, had been under surveillance and that copies of his book had been confiscated from the university he attends.
195 2009-08-08 Wall Street was so bullish on Friday that it could have passed for Pamplona.

Stock markets surged, hitting their highest levels since autumn as investors took in the news that the economy shed only 247,000 jobs in July, its smallest losses in nearly a year. And the American International Group, a black hole of losses and government bailouts, said Friday that it had turned a profit. Investors abandoned the safety of government bonds and rolled the dice with riskier junk bonds.

“The recession is dead,” Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital, declared in a research note. “Long live the recovery.”

With consumer stocks leading the way, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.81 points, or 1.2 percent, to 9,370.07, while the wider Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index hit its highest levels since early October and was up 1.34 percent, or 13.40 points, at 1,010.48. The Nasdaq was 1.37 percent, or 27.09 points higher at 2,000.25.

Shares of the Walt Disney Company finished 5.2 percent higher, Nordstrom closed up 8.2 percent and J. C. Penney 9.7 percent. Shares of hotel chains, office suppliers and banks all bounded higher on investor optimism.

And shares of A.I.G. continued to rise. The stock closed up 20.5 percent after rising 63 percent on Wednesday and 2.4 percent on Thursday. Shares, which started the week at $13.14, closed Friday at $27.14.

201 2009-08-09 In the two months since Alex Rodriguez’s pop-up popped out of his glove and onto the Yankee Stadium turf, Castillo has not so much shrunk as he has shined, becoming one of the Mets’ few bright lights.

Since then, Castillo was batting .321 (44 for 137) with a .415 on-base percentage entering Saturday’s game. In fact, his .468 on-base percentage since July 5 was the best in baseball. It was a return to the type of slap-hitting, slick-fielding player who once earned three Gold Gloves and made three All-Star Game appearances.

“You don’t wish that on anybody, but at the same time, it happens,” Mets third baseman David Wright said of Castillo’s drop. “The way he’s bounced back and taken his game to another level is more important than dropping the pop-up. He’s rebounded nicely.”

Castillo has shown an ability to rebound all season. Out of shape after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in late 2007, Castillo batted .245 last season and was replaced at times by Damion Easley.

Castillo, having played previously in Florida and Minnesota, where the fans are not as involved as they are in New York, struggled with the boos he received.

“We all knew this was part of his package,” Manager Jerry Manuel said of his performance this season. “Unfortunately, last year we didn’t see it. What he went through last year wasn’t acceptable — not only to him, but by the people he was representing, the fans. I think the experience he had last year was some serious growth for him.”

The Mets were so disappointed that they wanted to pursue the free agent Orlando Hudson, who eventually signed with the Dodgers. To sign Hudson, the Mets would have had to trade Castillo. And with $18 million still owed to him, the Mets could not find a suitor.

Meanwhile, Castillo returned to the Dominican Republic, lost 17 pounds and gained some resolve.

“I know when you play in a big city, when you have bad years, I heard everything — I was getting traded; Luis, you need to focus more,” Castillo said. “My first day of spring training, I want to impress Omar and Jerry and all the coaches. I know what I have to do. I’ll have a good spring training and let me show you what I can do.”

He did his best to do that, but that dropped pop-up brought back unpleasant memories.

“It stayed with me a couple days,” Castillo said. “I have to prove to the fans: if I get down when I drop this pop-up, maybe my career is over. When you go through what I did last year and if I put my head down, and have two bad years in a row, that’s hard.”

He added: “I had a lot of messages from friends, who call me who say: ‘Luis, forget about it. Keep going.’ That’s what I been thinking. The next day, when I play in Yankee Stadium, I’m ready. The next day, I had a good night. I had to play hard.”

Castillo did. Although the Mets struggled as their injuries mounted, Castillo flourished hitting in front of Wright. But he had another setback after he grounded out in the seventh inning Tuesday against St. Louis. Castillo bounded into the dugout, but his left ankle collapsed when he tried to avoid a glove that a teammate had left on the steps.

The Mets have seen more serious injuries, like the torn hamstring of Jon Niese, and more important ones, which have cost them Jose Reyes, Carlos Delgado and Carlos Beltran. But none of them symbolized the Mets’ season better than Castillo’s tumble.

“It’s unbelievable,” Castillo said. “When I got hurt, I said, What’s going on here? All these injuries. I hope next year it’s different.”

Reliever Billy Wagner, trying to return from elbow surgery, allowed one hit and struck out a batter in a 15-pitch outing for St. Lucie of the Florida State League.
202 2009-08-09 The United States has again produced a world champion, though not in regular chess, but in a variant named for Bobby Fischer.

Hikaru Nakamura, the United States champion, won the Chess960 world championship at the Mainz Chess Classic in Germany on July 30. Also called Fischer Random Chess (because Fischer was an ardent supporter), Chess960 has 960 starting positions, based on shuffling the pieces along the first and eighth ranks. (The white and black pieces face their counterparts, so if a white rook is on f1, a black rook is on f8.)

With so many possible starting positions, a knowledge of regular chess openings is not much use. Players who excel instead at tactics and maneuvering usually do well.

The Mainz Chess Classic is one of the most popular competitions of the year. It includes a rapid tournament (20 minutes per player per game, with five seconds added after each move), a rapid world championship among four players, a Chess960 tournament (played at the same rate as the rapid tournament) and the Chess960 world championship with four players.

Nakamura was part of the Chess960 championship because he won the 960 tournament last year. (Gata Kamsky, an American, almost won this year, but he lost in the last round, allowing Alexander Grischuk of Russia to overtake him. Kamsky tied for second.) After surviving the preliminary rounds, Nakamura faced Levon Aronian of Armenia, the defending champion, in the final.

Aronian, who is No. 4 in the world, is not considered an opening expert, but he is brilliant in the middle phase of the game, which is why he is so adept at 960.
203 2009-08-09 Such a system is tantamount to a carbon tax. The auction price of an emission right is effectively a tax on carbon. The revenue raised by the auction gives the government the resources to cut other taxes that distort behavior, like income or payroll taxes.

So far, so good. The problem occurred as this sensible idea made the trip from the campaign trail through the legislative process. Rather than auctioning the carbon allowances, the bill that recently passed the House would give most of them away to powerful special interests.

The numbers involved are not trivial. From Congressional Budget Office estimates, one can calculate that if all the allowances were auctioned, the government could raise $989 billion in proceeds over 10 years. But in the bill as written, the auction proceeds are only $276 billion.

Mr. Obama understood these risks. When asked about a carbon tax in an interview in July 2007, he said: “I believe that, depending on how it is designed, a carbon tax accomplishes much of the same thing that a cap-and-trade program accomplishes. The danger in a cap-and-trade system is that the permits to emit greenhouse gases are given away for free as opposed to priced at auction. One of the mistakes the Europeans made in setting up a cap-and-trade system was to give too many of those permits away.”

Congress is now in the process of sending President Obama a bill that makes exactly this mistake.

How much does it matter? For the purpose of efficiently allocating the carbon rights, it doesn’t. Even if these rights are handed out on political rather than economic grounds, the “trade” part of “cap and trade” will take care of the rest. Those companies with the most need to emit carbon will buy carbon allowances on newly formed exchanges. Those without such pressing needs will sell whatever allowances they are given and enjoy the profits that resulted from Congress’s largess.

The problem arises in how the climate policy interacts with the overall tax system. As the president pointed out, a cap-and-trade system is like a carbon tax. The price of carbon allowances will eventually be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for carbon-intensive products. But if most of those allowances are handed out rather than auctioned, the government won’t have the resources to cut other taxes and offset that price increase. The result is an increase in the effective tax rates facing most Americans, leading to lower real take-home wages, reduced work incentives and depressed economic activity.

The hard question is whether, on net, such a policy is good or bad. Here you can find policy wonks on both sides. To those who view climate change as an impending catastrophe and the distorting effects of the tax system as a mere annoyance, an imperfect bill is better than none at all. To those not fully convinced of the enormity of global warming but deeply worried about the adverse effects of high current and prospective tax rates, the bill is a step in the wrong direction.

What everyone should agree on is that the legislation making its way through Congress is a missed opportunity. President Obama knows what a good climate bill would look like. But despite his immense popularity and personal charisma, he appears unable to persuade Congress to go along.

As for me, I hope the president refuses to sign a bill that fails to auction most of the allowances. Some might say a veto would make the best the enemy of the good. But sometimes good is not good enough.
204 2009-08-09 And on that day, at that time, we would’ve followed that general anywhere. It was a very small thing, and he didn’t need to do it, but it impressed upon me that small gestures are hugely important.

Q. What’s the best career advice someone ever gave you?

A. I believed early in my career that if I just worked hard, put my head down and did my job, everyone would notice and good things would happen. And in fact, that’s not true, necessarily. You can do your job and you can toil along in anonymity without anybody noticing for a real long time.

I was among the last people in my class who came into Procter & Gamble to be promoted to brand manager, and I would attribute part of that to the fact that I just wasn’t very savvy politically. A mentor taught me that no one could micromanage my own career better than me. And so I won’t say that I became more demanding, but I certainly began to have more of a plan around things that I felt I needed to do to grow, and I was more overt stating what I wanted or what I needed.

I think it’s an implied contract. You know, when you work at a company, you owe them a good day’s work. The company owes you a fair salary and growth opportunities. I was giving my best effort but I didn’t think I was getting, in some cases, all the return. So I started asking for it, not in a rude way, but in a way that it implied a quid pro quo, so to speak.

A. There was a point in time in my career where I was told point blank that I wasn’t going to be promoted, that I didn’t have the skills to go on to the next level. And when you’re faced with a situation like that, there’s two ways you can respond to it: You can accept it and you can move on, which I think would’ve been the easy thing to do, or you could seek to find out why people had that belief and convince them that you can do the work. I chose the latter.

I think when you’re faced with that, everybody has to dig in to look at themselves and say, “Am I here to make something happen, or am I going to believe this to be the case?” There are some things that are within your control and that you’ve got to drive to make happen. And there are some things that are outside your control that you can’t.

When they said I wouldn’t be promoted, I basically said, “Tell me what I need to do.” And I focused like a laser beam on those things and I delivered those.

Q. What has surprised you most about the top job?

A. One is the breadth of topics or issues that you’re confronted with on a daily basis, and you have to be able to go from one thing to another to another, and sometimes it feels like they’re completely unrelated.

In some cases it’s a snap decision. It’s got to be, “This is how we’re going to proceed, move forward” versus taking time to really contemplate the question. So if you’re not comfortable with dealing in gray areas or you’re not comfortable with deciding with 75 or 80 percent of the data you would want to have, then this is not a job that people should aspire to.

I think the other piece is just the demands of the various constituents. You know, you have employee demands, I’ve got a board of directors that has demands. There are investors, there are analysts and shareholders and so on and so forth, and they all require time and attention. So marshaling enough time so that you don’t feel like you’re giving everybody short shrift is really tough to do.

The other piece is the fishbowl nature of the job. It’s relentless to some degree, in that respect.

Q. How do you make sure you’ve got the energy to do all that?

A. I think part of it’s just genes and disposition. I’ve always been an early-morning riser. I like to get up early. I like to get a workout in because that gets the blood pumping to face the day. So a couple times a week, I’m up at 4:45 or 5 at the latest.

Q. How do you hire?

A. When I’m hiring, particularly at the senior levels, I’m looking for a couple of things. One is demonstrated leadership — has somebody shown that they have mastered the work, that they can lead people and lead organizations? I look for intelligence — business intelligence — and I’m not talking book intelligence. I’m rarely swayed by people who were 4.0 students at the best colleges and universities. I’m just talking about basic smarts.

You do recruit for raw intelligence because if you don’t have it, you don’t have it. You either do or you don’t. But I’m also looking for some street savviness. I’m looking for the ability to work with other people.

Teamwork’s important to me. I grew up playing on teams. I’m not a fan of people who are “lone wolves” at the tops of organizations, because they don’t do a good job of working with me and with the organization in many cases.

So I ask them to tell me about a time when they were in, say, a leadership situation where something simply would not have happened had they not been there, and what they did to influence the action. Questions like that tend to be pretty open-ended.

Q. It’s hard to test for those intangibles up front.

A. Yes it is, which is why I want to spend time with people. At the levels I’m hiring for, I want to have a meal with you. I want to meet your spouse. They should want to do the same thing with me and with my spouse, because you get a sense for who people are when you get them out of the business environment.

I’ll tell you another quick story. There was a woman named Rosemary who long ago retired from Procter & Gamble. Rosemary was a cafeteria worker, and at the time at P. & G., we actually had a cart that would come around at 7, 7:30 in the morning. They would ring a bell and you’d go get a cup of coffee and a doughnut or a bagel or something to start off your day.

And Rosemary had an uncanny ability to discern who was going to make it and who wasn’t going to make it. And I remember, when I was probably almost a year into the organization, she told me I was going to be O.K. But she also told me some of my classmates who were with the company weren’t going to make it. And she was more accurate than the H.R. organization was.

When I talked to her, I said, “How’d you know?” She could tell just by the way they treated people. In her mind, everybody was going to drop the ball at some point, and then she said: “You know you’re going to drop the ball at some point, and I see that you’re good with people and people like you and you treat them right. They’re going to pick up the ball for you, and they’re going to run and they’re going to score a touchdown for you. But if they don’t like you, they’re going to let that ball lie there and you’re going to get in trouble.”

Again, I think it’s those intangible things. I had taken the time to get to know Rosemary and know that her husband’s name was Floyd and know the thing that they did in their off-time was bowling. So, it is all those little intangible things that you see, not when you’re sitting around a table in a conference room, but what you see in other ways.

A. When people ask me for time, they generally don’t need the time that they ask for. So my assistant asks people, “How much time do you need?” and, “What are the outcomes?” If they say an hour, we cut it in half. If they say 30 minutes, we cut it to 15, because it forces people to be clearer and more concise. By doing that, I’m able to cram a number of things into the day and move people in and out more effectively and more efficiently.

Sometimes there are things that people come in to discuss because they want face time, or because they’re unsure, or they want me to make a decision so they can say that I made the decision and hide behind that. And so those things don’t work very well.

A. I live by my BlackBerry, as most of us do. I do make it a point on Friday night to turn it off and I don’t turn it on again until Sunday morning. I do that for a couple of reasons. One is, you have to try to separate at some point during the week. Anybody who needs me, whether it’s a board member or one of my leaders, they know how to reach me if something comes up that’s a crisis.

The other reason I turn it off is because when things come in, if I respond, then I’ve got people in the organization who would see that I’ve responded on Saturday morning at 8 a.m. And the next thing I know, I have a response to my response at 8:15 and so it goes. And I want people to have a life.

Q. How do you find out now in your position what people throughout the company are thinking?

A. The more senior you get, the harder it is to really keep a pulse on things. I tell people that coming to my office is like going to the principal’s office. Nobody wants to make that walk if they can avoid it, for the most part.

I call people and say, “Hey, can you come talk to me?” They bring all their staff books and things, and I literally want to have a conversation. So I walk around and I ask questions. I think the best way to do it, to figure out what’s really going on, is to travel to the other company locations that are away from the corporate headquarters and have town hall-style meetings.

I send out on at least a quarterly basis, sometimes more frequently, e-mails to all employees. I help them understand what our results were, as an organization, what some of the issues are, what some of our priorities should be.

I’ve gotten responses back, sometimes from only 50 employees, sometimes from as many as 200 or 300. And I do my best over the course of a couple of days to respond to every one of those e-mails. So I’ve actually got people in the organization who I’ve established dialogues with over the course of the last couple of years, who will send me notes that will say, “You know, have you thought about this?” or, “You should know this is going on in our company or in our location.” And I treat every one of those pieces of information with a great deal of respect. I protect their anonymity, and it gives me a good picture of some things that are going on that I otherwise wouldn’t know.

Q. What do you think business schools should teach more of, or less of?

A. Having gone to business school — this is going to sound terrible but I’m going to say it anyway — I didn’t learn that much at business school. It was a great way for me to transition from the military to the private sector, and I learned basic things, like buy low and sell high. I learned that sometimes it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. And I made some lifelong friends, which was all good.

I think I’d ask them to be mindful of teaching about leadership. If I was going to teach a course, that’s what I would teach, about leadership, about playing nicely in the sandbox with others, about being more collaborative, and I would ask them to teach or to impress upon people that when they graduate, it does take a little while to get a job like mine.

I can’t tell you the number of young people who think that they’re going to end up with a job like mine after a year or five years. It just doesn’t work that way, and I think if people could come out of business schools with a more realistic sense of how things really operate in organizations, and that there is a bit of dues-paying that has to happen, we’d all be better off. So managing expectations is something that I’d ask those people to really think through.

A. I would tell people that the race ultimately doesn’t go to the fast. It goes to the strong. It goes to the resilient and it goes to the people who are well prepared. I have my own kids, and I tell them that when I walk into a room of more than five or seven people, I know that I am not the smartest guy in the room and I’m very, very comfortable with that fact. There are people who are off-the-charts smart, and that’s great. That’s good for them. I like to surround myself with really smart people, as I said before.

I will outwork, and have over the course of my career, about anybody. If you’re clear about what you want, if you’re strong, if you’re resilient, if you’re well prepared and you’re willing to work — I mean really work — then good things can happen. I’m a guy who never planned to be in an office like this, and that was not my goal coming out of business school, believe it or not. And so, it surprises me that I’m in this role and in this job. I think when you’re too focused on the top job, you can get derailed somewhere along the way.
205 2009-08-09 Emily Livingston Schreiner, a daughter of Janet Schreiner and Dr. Mark S. Schreiner of Wynnewood, Pa., was married in a Quaker-style self-uniting ceremony Saturday at her parents’ house, to Aaron McCulley Miller, the son of Loren H. Miller and Dr. Melvin E. Miller of Montpelier, Vt.

208 2009-08-09 His firm, Country Club Advisor, offered to help clubs increase membership, cut costs and recruit top management. Even then, with the economy going strong, many clubs were struggling against dwindling membership. A new generation of men, more involved in their children’s lives, didn’t have time for six hours of golf and drinks on a Saturday.

Mr. Shaw sent out his first mailing in fall 2004, vowing to be an impartial consultant between the two forces that control country clubs: the board — member-volunteers who oversee the clubs — and the general managers, the paid staff members that run the clubs. “We will not be intimidated, swayed or directed by either board members or managers,” he wrote. He also offered the “$25,000 challenge” — if he did not find $25,000 in savings that a club felt was legitimate, he would not charge for his services.

Almost immediately, he ran afoul of the powerful organization of country club general managers, the Metropolitan Club Managers Association. The local chapter includes 230 managers and assistant managers at 100 of the most prestigious country clubs in Westchester and Long Island, a tightknit group that represents over 90 percent of local club managers.

Association members complained he was going behind their backs to board members and making them look bad. According to one e-mail message that Mr. Shaw provided a reporter, Michael Galluzzo, general manager of Brae Burn Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., at the time, wrote: “I am outraged that David Shaw would send a mailing to my house chairman describing a $25,000 challenge. This challenge is for his company to come into my club and show them how they can save $25,000. How dare he!!” The message, which was addressed to the head of the managers’ association at the time, Barry Chandler, and forwarded to Mr. Shaw continued: “As president of our association, I am calling upon you to put a stop to this kind of behavior.” The message concluded: “If he wants to save clubs money, let him go to any of the other 49 states and see how they like it.”

Mr. Shaw contends this was the beginning of a unified effort by the club managers association to blackball him; that his newsletter mailings were destroyed by general managers before board members could see them; that the effort intensified after the economic collapse in the fall of 2008 and culminated with meetings in the spring of 2009, at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, N.Y., and the Salem Golf Club in North Salem, N.Y., where, he said, he was warned to stop with his cost-saving offers.

In June, Mr. Shaw filed a lawsuit against the association and its leaders, seeking financial damages.

Joseph Ortego, a lawyer for the association’s leadership, declined to comment on the e-mail message or any other aspect of Mr. Shaw’s suit. He referred a reporter to a July 17 letter sent by Todd Zorn, the association president, to its members: “Rest assured that both the chapter and the individuals named deny all the allegations within the lawsuit and look forward to presenting the facts as this unfolds through the legal system.”

Mr. Shaw said that when he walked into the office of his lawyer, Jeffrey K. Brown, he knew he was crossing a line that could cost him dearly. “I knew I might be giving up my career, signing my death warrant. The country club world is a tightknit, secretive community. The thing is, at this point, I’m dead if I don’t do anything, and I’m dead if I do.”

He said his business of four employees grossed half a million dollars in 2008, but the “boycott” had cost him work with several clubs, at a loss of as much as $120,000 a job.

Mr. Shaw had many satisfied customers. Dr. Robert Lewis, admissions chairman at North Shore Country Club in Glen Head, said the club used Mr. Shaw’s services for two years and was very pleased. “He improved membership, dining services, pool services — he raised the bar,” he said. Tony Vespa, president of Upper Montclair Country Club in New Jersey, said Mr. Shaw found them a new general manager and golf course superintendent. “He was highly professional, organized, knew his business,” Mr. Vespa said.

Mr. Shaw said in 5 years he’s placed about 20 general managers and assistant managers, but only half belonged to the association. “They didn’t like losing control,” Mr. Shaw said.

On Sept. 25, 2006, Randy Ruder, general manager of Beach Point Club in Mamaroneck and the association president at the time, sent a certified letter to Mr. Shaw criticizing him for “targeting mailings to club boards without the manager’s knowledge,” calling it a violation of the association’s ethics policy. The letter requested that Mr. Shaw “stop this practice immediately.”

“This is America,” Mr. Shaw said in an interview. “I can send mail to anyone I want.” He also noted that he’d offered to send his newsletters to managers in e-mail form so they would have them before their boards. “That wasn’t the real issue,” he said. “They were afraid of losing control.”

The final straw for Mr. Shaw came earlier this year, when he was about to hire Gene Westmoreland, the Metropolitan Golf Association’s longtime tournament director and a highly respected figure in the country club world.

In an interview, Mr. Westmoreland said he had known Mr. Shaw for years and was very impressed with him. He confirmed that he was considering joining Mr. Shaw’s firm until he spoke to “a couple of people” who told him “David’s relationship with the general managers was not as strong as it might be.” He declined to identify those people, adding, “No one said I should not do it.”

“For me to succeed in this work, a wonderful relationship with general mangers would be essential,” he said, “and since that was an issue, I decided to pull back.”

Mr. Shaw said when he complained about this at an April 3 meeting at Salem Golf Club, Mr. Zorn, the association president, told him to stop his mailings or “we’ll continue to stop you.”

Mr. Shaw said the economy plus the Madoff fraud has ratcheted up the pressure on country club managers. “It’s bloody,” he said. “More’s at stake now.” He said he’s learned a hard lesson that people who go into business for themselves come to understand: You try to anticipate everything, but you never do.

Mr. Shaw’s lawsuit against the Metropolitan Club Managers Association, alleging its leaders were blackballing him because he tried to cut costs at the clubs, has been dismissed by a New York State Supreme Court judge in Nassau County.

The judge, Stephen A. Bucaria, said in a March 10 ruling that Mr. Shaw had failed to provide sufficient evidence that the organization and its leaders had violated state antitrust laws or defamed Mr. Shaw.

James M. Andriola, a lawyer for the association, said that he was “extremely pleased” that all 11 claims had been dismissed.

Mr. Shaw said he intends to appeal.
209 2009-08-09 “I had high esteem for Jimmy. He was my man, you know? I looked up to him. So I said, I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt. I’m going to understand this.”

And so he did.

Outside jazz circles, Mr. Vazquez — voluble, rotund and given to belly laughs and salty language — is mostly unknown. Even in Westchester, his home turf, Mr. Vazquez said, he has yet to make a musical dent. But among aficionados, though, his reputation is as outsize as his personality. “They call me Mr. Bomba Jazz,” he said.

Bomba is a drum-heavy Puerto Rican rhythm. Mr. Vazquez, who moved to Bronxville with his wife, Edelina Figueroa de Vazquez, in 2000, began experimenting with it in a jazz context decades ago, after a childhood influenced by a bevy of music-loving Puerto Rican aunts and uncles and full immersion in the island’s native sounds.

Shuffling between Philadelphia, where he bought his first trombone at 13 (a friend’s brother sold it to him used for $5), and Puerto Rico, where he lived for years, Mr. Vazquez developed an ear for all kinds of music, including R&B and salsa.

By the time he was in his midteens, though, Latin jazz became a calling. At 17, he was playing “with the best bands in Philly,” he said.

In his 35-year career — much of it spent in Yonkers and the Bronx while the Vazquezes, who have been married 26 years, saved money for their move to Bronxville — Mr. Vazquez has played with Dizzy Gillespie, the Ray Charles Orchestra, Tito Puente, Wayne Shorter and other jazz greats.

In 1990, he performed on the soundtrack to Spike Lee’s film “Mo’ Better Blues.” He was a founding member in 2002 of Lincoln Center’s Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a now-disbanded all-star group. And his most recent album — “Marooned/Aislado” (Picaro Records), which he arranged and conducted — was nominated for a 2009 Grammy for best Latin jazz recording.

He will play with his band, Pirates Troubadours (Piratas Trovadores), at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center’s “Sounds of the City” festival in Newark on Aug. 27 and, three days later, at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival in Manhattan’s Tompkins Square Park.

“He’s extremely high-energy,” said Verushka Wray-Spirito, co-producer of “Sounds of the City,” who booked him for the show. “Papo is always really on fire. How he is as a person translates to his music. It’s very vibrant, very contagious.”

Though Mr. Vazquez continues to go all-out during performances, he no longer likes to be called Mr. Bomba Jazz. “People were pigeonholing me,” he said. Which is why, in the mid-1990s, he made a move to take his music in a more eclectic direction.

“I wanted something unidentifiable,” he said, “because that’s what jazz should be — it should be a free type of expressive art. You know, free to roam all kind of places.” Around the same time, he gave his ever-evolving band its current name.

“I told Mike Viñas, who’s the bass player for Rubén Blades, I said, ‘I want a new name for my band.’ He said, ‘You really ought to call them pirate troubadours.’ I said, ‘You’re right! I am a pirate troubadour.’ Then I needed to come up with a definition of what a pirate troubadour is,” Mr. Vazquez said.

“What it is is somebody who will steal your musical allegiance. And we basically do. We’re dangerous. After you see us, you’re not the same person anymore. Whatever you thought music was, it’s no longer that. Whatever you allowed yourself to like before, once you hear us, you’ll be like, ‘I don’t know no more,’ you know?”
210 2009-08-09 Those are the products overtly aimed at younger audiences. But the celebration of youth, in particular of male immaturity, extends to movies like “The Hangover,” Todd Phillips’s riotous and regressive crude-dude comedy with a superficial resemblance to the school-of-Apatow line, and J. J. Abrams’s “Star Trek,” which reimagines the beloved space-travel adventure as, essentially, a Harry Potter movie.

There are exceptions of course. “Angels & Demons” sent a cast of grownups chasing around the Vatican in search of clues to an ancient mystery. And the season’s successful romantic comedies, “The Proposal” and “The Ugly Truth,” while perfectly conventional, do their predictable business in a more or less adult setting. But everyone (at least in the United States) has already forgotten about “Angels & Demons,” and the Hollywood rom-com, in olden times a sparkling repository of wit and glamour, has been relegated to the status of commercial counterprogramming. Those are date movies, chick flicks, a condescending little something for the ladies. The real action is elsewhere, with the boys and their toys.

I know, I know. School’s out. People want an easy good time, free air-conditioning to go with their expensive snacks, a little escapism in a time of stress. These are the truisms of summer, invoked every time some pointy-headed grouch complains about the prevalence of sequels, or superhero movies, or big, dumb popcorn spectacles. We like big, dumb popcorn spectacles.

Or course we do — even the pointy-headed grouches among us. But those reliable axioms about the taste and expectations of the mass movie audience are not so much laws of nature as artifacts of corporate strategy. And the lessons derived from them conveniently serve to strengthen a status quo that increasingly marginalizes risk, originality and intelligence.

The big lesson of the summer of 2009 is that those qualities, while they may be desirable in some abstract, ideal way, don’t pay the bills. The studios, housed in large and beleaguered media conglomerates, have grown more cautious as the economy has faltered, releasing fewer movies and concentrating resources on dependable formulas. Nearly every big hit so far has been part of a franchise built on an established cultural brand.

In the case of the comedies, raunchy or romantic, the genre functions as the brand, and in the case of “Up,” the Pixar label, almost uniquely in today’s Hollywood, carries its own cachet and appeal. But otherwise (and to some extent in these cases as well) the last few months have been a festival of the known, the stuff you already bought and, from force of habit or loyalty or maybe even satisfaction, decided to upgrade.

Not every new product is a sure bet. “Terminator Salvation” didn’t do so well, but then again the original Terminator is having some trouble in his current job. From Wolverine and Mr. Spock in May through the Decepticons and wizards of July it has been a triumph of the tried and true, occasionally revitalized or decked out with novelty, but mostly just what we expected. No surprises.

What kind of person constantly demands something new and yet always wants the same thing? A child of course. From toddlerhood we are fluent in the pop-cultural consumerist idiom: Again! More! Another one! (That George Simmons giant-baby comedy is called “Redo.”) Children are ceaselessly demanding, it’s true; but they are also easily satisfied, and this combination of appetite and docility makes the child an ideal moviegoer. But since there are a finite number of literal children out there, with limited disposable income and short attention spans, Hollywood has to make or find new ones. And so the studios have, with increasing vigor and intensity, carried out a program of mass infantilization.

The mostly pedestrian, occasionally enchanting, highly lucrative movies of this summer offer testimony to the success of that program. And the seasonal roster of winners and losers, as defined by box office tea-leaf readers, suggests some additional dividends. Toys, comic books, and familiar fictional characters are a bigger, more reliable draw than movie stars or well-known directors, and are also easier to control.

Wolverine, Captain Kirk, Harry Potter, Hasbro — those trademarks and secondary merchandising opportunities will reliably get kids into the theaters. But the examples of “The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,” “Public Enemies” and, perhaps, “Funny People” are widely taken to mean that artists like Denzel Washington, John Travolta, Michael Mann, Johnny Depp and Judd Apatow may not have the same guaranteed pull. Never mind that “Public Enemies” has actually done pretty well after a slow start, and that the running time, subject matter and tone of “Funny People” make it hard to compare with “Knocked Up” or “Happy Gilmore.” Conventional wisdom is always happy to ignore such nuances.

This may be because any reduction in the clout of stars or the autonomy of directors redounds to the benefit of the companies that own the copyrights and distribute the goods. And a little anthology of cautionary economic tales from this summer will prove useful in the future, when ambitions need to be corralled and egos held in check. Middle-aged actors and critically lauded directors look like extravagances rather than sound investments. Forty is the new dead. Auteur is French for unemployed. “The Hurt Locker” — the kind of fierce and fiery action movie that might have been a blockbuster once upon a time — is treated like a delicate, exotic flower, released into art houses and sold on its prestige rather than on its visceral power.

The box office numbers don’t lie, but they don’t tell the whole story either. The weekend grosses, widely guessed at on Thursday night and breathlessly reported by the middle of Sunday afternoon, record the quantity of tickets purchased, but they cannot register the quality of the experience. The aggregate of receipts shows that a lot of people like going to the movies, but not necessarily that they like what they see.

Commercial success may represent the public’s embrace of a piece of creative work, or it may just represent the vindication of a marketing strategy. In bottom-line terms, this is a distinction without a difference. A movie that people will go and see, almost as if they had no choice, is a safer business proposition than one they may have to bother thinking about. In this respect “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” is exemplary. It brilliantly stymies reflection, thwarts argument, arrests intelligent response. The most interesting thing about the movie — apart from Megan Fox’s outfits, I suppose — is that it has made nearly $400 million domestically.

There is nothing else to say. Any further discussion — say about whether it’s a good movie or not — sounds quaint, old-fashioned, passé. Get a clue, grandpa.

Or go see “Up,” the only hugely successful movie of the summer that engages genuinely adult themes. It’s about loss, frustration, disappointment. And it offers one of the season’s most pointed and paradoxical lessons. If you want to make a mature film for mature audiences, make sure it’s a cartoon.
211 2009-08-09 3 mint sprigs, leaves only, plus one mint sprig for garnish

1. To make the syrup: In a heatproof container fitted with a lid, pour the boiling water over the Demerara sugar. Screw on the lid and shake until the sugar has dissolved. Cool completely. Excess can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for a week or so.

2. Prepare the drink: In the bottom of a cocktail shaker, crush the mint leaves with the pineapple, lime juice and Demerara syrup. Strain into the bottom of a tall glass. Add cachaça or, for the nonalcoholic version, pineapple juice. Fill the glass with finely cracked ice and stir well, preferably until the outside of the glass is frosty. Top off the glass with more cracked ice and, for the alcoholic version, the Chartreuse. The mint sprig garnishes both versions, which should be served with a straw.
212 2009-08-09 With the 40th anniversary of Woodstock looming — so soon? — the commemorative machinery is clanking into place, and the nostalgia is strong. There’s a Woodstock Festival museum now at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts and a recently built concert hall at what was the concert site, Max Yasgur’s farm (though the original Woodstock hillside has been left undeveloped).

A new, much expanded anthology of music recorded at the 1969 festival has been issued: the six-CD “Woodstock 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur’s Farm” (Rhino). Complete Woodstock performances by , Santana, and others have been released by Legacy. Cable and public television channels have their Woodstock specials scheduled, and there’s yet another batch of commemorative books, including “The Road to Woodstock” (Ecco) by the festival’s instigator, Michael Lang, which includes tidbits like how much the bands were paid. a comedy directed by , is due for release this month.

A summer package tour, Heroes of Woodstock, features musicians who appeared at Woodstock — including Jefferson Starship (playing songs), Levon Helm from the Band, Tom Constanten from the , Ten Years After, Canned Heat and Country Joe McDonald. It arrives at Bethel Woods precisely on Aug. 15.

Unlike previous anniversaries in 1994 and 1999, however, there’s no big festival this year bearing the Woodstock name — reflecting, perhaps, the dismal memories of Woodstock ’99 in Rome, N.Y., where a hot, pent-up audience, angry at high vendor prices, set fires and looted and vandalized the site.

While the original Woodstock showed how much discomfort an audience would put up with for the sake of sharing an event — something promoters were happy to learn — Woodstock ’99 breached the limit of fan exploitation.

Yet the original Woodstock still has a rosy glow. It was finite and all smiles — far different from the Vietnam War, the racial tensions and the much-discussed generation gap of the same era. Woodstock became free in both senses of the word: free as in liberated (from drug laws and dress codes) and free as in gratis, not collecting tickets and handing out, as Wavy Gravy said, “breakfast in bed for 400,000.”

A cynic might see the festival as a prime example of how coddled the baby boomers were in an economy of abundance. The Woodstock crowd, which arrived with more drugs than camping supplies, got itself a free concert, and when the people responsible could no longer handle the logistics, the government bailed them out. Some people took it upon themselves to help others; many just freeloaded.

Still, Woodstock gave virtually everyone involved — ticketholders, gate crashers, musicians, doctors, the police — a sense of shared humanity and cooperation. Trying to get through the weekend, people played nice with one another, which was only sensible. Musicians performed for the biggest audience of their lives. Townspeople and the National Guard pitched in to keep people fed and healthy. No one, The New York Times reported, called the cops “pigs.”

One lunatic with a gun could have changed everything. The Altamont Festival, marred all day by violence, took place only four months later. Miraculously, at Woodstock, there was none.

Seemingly within minutes after it ended Woodstock was the stuff of legend: a spirit, a nation, an ideal, amorphous but vivid, with an Oscar-winning documentary film, the 1970 to prove it wasn’t all a hallucination. (The film was also an early lesson in how profitable ancillary rights could be; the festival itself lost money, but the film recouped it many times over.)

Sheer size made Woodstock consequential. It was huge. had played to 55,000 people at ; the 1965 Folk Festival spread about 71,000 people over four days. Had Woodstock drawn the 100,000 to 150,000 people that its promoters planned for, it would simply have been one in a string of big rock festivals dating back to Monterey Pop in 1967, which had an estimated total of 200,000 people over three days.

After Woodstock gave up on collecting tickets — abandoning flimsy fences and declaring itself a free festival — it grew to what was variously estimated as 300,000 or 400,000 people, more than double the attendance of previous rock festivals. That number would have been considerably higher if traffic problems hadn’t turned some away; many people walked for miles to the site.

When the hippie subculture surfaced en masse at Woodstock, two years after the Summer of Love, it was still largely self-invented and isolated. There were pockets of freaks in cities and handfuls of them in smaller towns, nearly all feeling like outsiders. For many people at the festival, just seeing and joining that gigantic crowd was more of a revelation than anything that happened onstage. It proved that they were not some negligible minority but members of a larger culture — or, to use that sweetly dated term, a counterculture.

At Woodstock hippiedom simultaneously reached its public peak and opened itself to imitation and trivialization — one more glimmer of rebellion to be deflated into a style statement.

For true believers Woodstock was about cooperation and mutual aid, and about making love, not war. (At a time when had divided America into hawks and doves, that was a peace dove sitting on the guitar in the festival logo.) But Woodstock was also a whole lot of people getting stoned at a rock concert, which was much easier than working to change the world.

Politicos like Abbie Hoffman, who is widely credited with coining the phrase Woodstock Nation, wanted to claim Woodstock as a symbol of resistance to repression. But batted Hoffman off the stage with a guitar when Hoffman interrupted ’s set to protest the imprisonment, for drug possession, of a fellow activist, John Sinclair.

There was antiwar fervor in some songs, like Richie Havens’s “Handsome Johnny” and “I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag.” spoke about her husband, in jail for draft dodging, and sang There was also, in much of the music, that particular late-1960s aura of imminent doom or enlightenment, in songs like “Wooden Ships” (performed by both Jefferson Airplane and ) and the Who’s “Amazing Journey.” And there was ’s with its screams of feedback and its divebombing glissandos, brash and dire, angry and insistently American. But Woodstock was no earnest rally; it had love songs, blues and extended guitar jams.

After the buzz wore off, the utopian communal aura of a Woodstock Nation gave way, almost immediately, to the reality of a Woodstock Market: a demographic target group about to have its dreams stripped of radical purpose and turned into commodities. A wider audience realized it was possible to enjoy the music, drugs and fun without the ideological trappings. Soon enough everyone was a quasi-hippie; long hair on men no longer signaled anything about what they stood for. FM radio, which was the pipeline for underground rock, traded quirky, exploratory disc jockeys for consistent formats that advertisers could depend on. Now that it was clear how large an audience was at stake — that it wasn’t just a few freaks — professionals were back in charge.

Woodstock and other late-1960s festivals changed the scale of rock concerts. Bands eagerly moved up to arenas from theaters; a week before Woodstock, for example, two of its acts, the Jefferson Airplane and Joe Cocker, shared a bill at the Fillmore East, which had all of 2,700 seats. Music soon expanded, or bloated, to fill its newfound arenas. The early 1970s were the era of noodling jams and 10-minute drum solos that would have to be torpedoed, a few years later, by punk-rock.

Larger gatherings followed Woodstock. An estimated 600,000 people showed up at both the Festival in 1970 and at the one-day Summer Jam at Watkins Glen, N.Y., in 1973. But those were merely concerts, not cultural symbols. Appropriately or not, Woodstock is still invoked when describing latter-day festivals, although they are considerably smaller, better organized and more comfortable than Woodstock was. None of them tolerate gate crashers.

Since Woodstock I’ve been to more rock festivals than I can easily remember. Most, sooner or later, involve mud. Some have simply been like extremely long standing-room concerts; some have the comforting familiarity of ritual, like the annual Jazz and Heritage Festival (which dates back almost as far as Woodstock; it had its 40th edition this year).

A few, like and , run in stretches like a smart disc-jockey set, segueing neatly through various bands. And a handful have felt like generational statements: the first (in 1991) and Lilith Fair (in 1997) and, surprisingly, Woodstock ’94 (in Saugerties, N.Y.), which juxtaposed performers from the original Woodstock Festival with more contemporary bands, creating what was probably the only mosh pit ever to greet Crosby, Stills and Nash. But all of them have been consumer experiences: a planned entertainment package of scheduled music and convenient vendors.

Woodstock was different. It was, particularly for a sheltered teenager, an adventure: sloppy, chaotic, bewildering, drenched, uncertain, sometimes excruciating, sometimes ecstatic. Although I was drug free, I had the feeling that the crowd was more than just an audience at a show, that something major was at stake, that Woodstock would prove something to the world. What it proved — that for at least one weekend, hippies meant what they said about peace and love — was fleeting and all too innocent; it couldn’t stand up to everyday human nature or to the pragmatic workings of the market. But 40 years later the sensation lingers.

Your article explains perfectly why I’ve given up on country radio. Sadly, there is a ton of good country music, but it is not being played on radio stations.

232 2009-08-10 Vikki Porter, the director of the Knight Digital Media Center at the University of Southern California, called the project an excellent example of how a classic journalism model “can be mashed up with the 2.0 storytelling tools of the Web.”

Ms. Sizemore declined to say whether the Elkhart Project was a profitable enterprise, saying “our best news projects serve the consumers’ needs and interests first.”

According to Web measurement firms, MSNBC.com’s Web sites are among the most popular in the country, with about 40 million visitors a month. MSNBC.com would not say how many visitors the project has attracted, but put its audience in the millions.

The project’s genesis was in MSNBC.com’s desire to relate the economic recession to lives of ordinary Americans. “The adage that all news is local is absolutely true,” Ms. Sizemore said, adding that personal reporting humanizes a story.

The Web site had focused at length on a town before: in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, MSNBC.com employees tracked the recovery of two Mississippi towns in a series called “Rising From Ruin.”

Ms. Sizemore said that the hurricane was a local story with national interest, and the Elkhart Project is in many ways the inverse: “It is coverage of a national story through the lens of one location, and includes tools and data that are relevant no matter where you live.”

Elkhart was chosen after President Obama visited the town in February and, as Ms. Sizemore put it, “staked his administration’s credibility on the success or failure of the town’s recovery.” He had already visited twice as a candidate.

A deputy editor suggested that staff members visit Elkhart the next day on an exploratory trip, and MSNBC editors eventually decided that it would serve as the soul of the Web site’s coverage.

The project, at ElkhartProject.MSNBC.com, includes several strands of reporting, including the causes of the somber unemployment statistics, the impact of the federal stimulus funds and the views of young people about the economy.

At the outset in April, the Web site intended to report from Elkhart through the one-year anniversary of Mr. Obama’s February visit. Ms. Sizemore now says the site will stay to track whether stimulus funds show up, and whether they have the intended effect.

“It may be a story that we never really drop from our radar,” she said.

Seemingly every day, an Elkhart article appears on MSNBC.com’s home page, often illustrated by a photo of a local citizen. When Mr. Obama visited Elkhart last week, an NBC correspondent asked him questions submitted by local residents.

Residents seem to have warmed up to the project. In the spring, Jennifer Holderread worried in blog posts and on forums that the city was “in danger of becoming nothing more than a media plaything.”

But her outlook has changed. “I think the people who were initially sent here to cover the economy had the forethought that they were going to cover nothing but poverty and despair,” she said in an e-mail message. Now, though, they are covering events like the county fair and new businesses, showing a more nuanced view of the city.

Dan Gillmor, who runs a center for digital media entrepreneurship at Arizona State University, praised the project’s ambition, but suggested that MSNBC.com should encourage genuine collaboration with the people of Elkhart, perhaps by incorporating local blogs and videos more fully. “The people of the community could contribute a lot more if they weren’t being seen as sources for interviews or anecdotes, or, to put it less kindly, as journalistic lab rats,” he said.

To buttress its big-picture coverage, MSNBC.com shares reporting with The Elkhart Truth. Ms. Porter said she was most intrigued by the collaboration of the national news organization and the local one.

Rather than merely parachuting into a local story, she said, “this is a commitment model, integrating the local news resources with the national perspective over the long haul.”
233 2009-08-10 Although rights lawyers and grass-roots social organizations have always been tightly controlled here, the pressure has intensified in recent weeks. More than 20 lawyers known for taking on politically tinged cases were effectively disbarred, and the police raided a group that works to ease discrimination against people with B.

Last week, China’s justice minister gave a speech saying lawyers should above all obey the Communist Party and help foster a harmonious society. To improve discipline, the minister said, all law firms in China would be sent party liaisons to “guide their work.”

But given Mr. Xu’s international stature and reputation for working within the law, legal scholars both in China and abroad say his prosecution suggests a new level of repression.

“What makes his detention particularly disturbing is that he’s a special figure in so many ways,” said Paul Gewirtz, director of the China Law Center at Yale Law School, which helped Mr. Xu establish his legal center, known here by its Chinese name, Gongmeng. “He’s at the forefront of advancing the rule of law, which is something everyone agrees China needs for its ongoing development.”

After 30 years of reform, China’s legal system is at a critical juncture. Law schools continue to pump out thousands of graduates each year, and the courts, even if imperfect, have increasingly become a forum for resolving disputes. Late last month the Supreme People’s Court announced reforms intended to markedly reduce executions.

But as lawyers here discover, there are limits to China’s embrace of judicial reform.

The Constitution, which includes guarantees of free speech and human rights, is unenforceable in court. Judges routinely ignore evidence, making determinations based on political considerations. And when it comes to vaguely defined offenses like “subversion of state power” or the invoking of “state secrets” laws, even the best-trained lawyers are powerless to defend the accused.

He Weifang, a law professor and legal adviser to Gongmeng, said conservative forces in the Communist Party were increasingly wary of lawyers, who they suspect are ultimately seeking to challenge one-party rule. Their greatest fear, Mr. He said, is that advocacy lawyers and civil society organizations could one day lead a pro-democracy movement among the poor and disenfranchised citizens they represent.

“What the authorities don’t appreciate, though, is that lawyers are leading these people to the courts, where their complaints can be resolved by rule of law,” he said. “People like Xu Zhiyong can only help the government solve some of the problems it faces.”

According to Gongmeng, Mr. Xu is being held at the Beijing No. 1 Detention Center, although public security officials have not confirmed that he is in their custody. Peng , a lawyer who is advising Gongmeng, said the authorities had imposed a $208,000 penalty for nonpayment of taxes due on funds received from Yale for cooperative research projects.

A day after the raid on Gongmeng’s office, Mr. Xu held a news conference to say that the accusations were baseless. He described the attack on his research center as a battle between corrupt officials and society’s most vulnerable citizens. “We believe conscience will surely triumph over the evil forces,” he said.

A week later, police officers came to his door and led him away. Another employee of the research center, Zhuang Lu, was also taken away the same day.

Soon after graduating from Peking University law school, Mr. Xu became immersed in the case of a graphic artist who was beaten to death in 2003 in police custody in the southern city of . The artist, Sun Zhigang, 27, had been arrested under vagrancy laws that allowed the police to detain people for traveling outside their registered hometowns without a permit.

Mr. Xu led a campaign to end the practice, which gained widespread media attention. A few months later, the State Council abolished the system.

That same year Mr. Xu rose to the defense of a muckraking editor jailed in Guangzhou after his newspaper, Southern Metropolis, ran a series of articles about Mr. Sun’s death. The editor, Cheng Yizhong, said Mr. Xu helped rally lawyers and journalists, leading to his release five months later. “Only Xu had the courage to take on my case,” he said.

More recently, he was preparing a challenge to black jails, the illegal holding cells that some officials use to silence persistent critics. Last year, friends say, he was roughed up several times while gathering evidence from petitioners who had come to Beijing to press their grievances to the central government.

Although he was less outspoken than some other rights activists, Mr. Xu did not shy away from cases that were bound to upset China’s power elite. Last May Gongmeng published a study challenging the official verdict that blames the for the 2008 riots in . The report, disseminated online and sent to government leaders, said legitimate grievances born from failed government policies were largely responsible for the unrest.

Raised in a Christian home in Henan Province, Mr. Xu was fond of noting his birth in a county called Minquan, which translates as “civil rights.” In an interview last year with The Economic Observer, a Chinese weekly, he said this had a profound impact on his social consciousness.

“I strive to be a worthy Chinese citizen, a member of the group of people who promote the progress of the nation,” he said. “I want to make people believe in ideals and justice, and help them see the hope of change.”
234 2009-08-10 When Ian Schafer, the chief executive of the digital ad agency Deep Focus, won 10 Communicator Awards for the agency’s work on Web sites, including one for HBO’s “Flight of the Conchords,” he was delighted.

He was less thrilled when he received a note from the awards: If he wanted the actual trophies, he would have to spend $1,590.

“When you have to pay for the trophy,” he said, “that seems a little egregious.”

It also seems to be how the Communicators make money. This year, the awards group named almost 1,600 winners in categories like “Commercials — Hospital (over 200 beds),” “Corporate Identity — Letterhead & Envelope,” and “Brochure — Company Overview.”

The organization was generous with its accolades. Clients that won in “Marketing/Promotion Post Card,” for instance, included a Johns Hopkins laboratory, Coca-Cola, art galleries at Texas Christian University, BioSante Pharmaceuticals Valentine’s Day card, and a card about a Web seminar with the dog-training specialist Cesar Millan.

Called for comment, a receptionist at the awards’ phone line said, rather uncommunicatively, “We don’t do interviews.”

Later, Linda Day, the executive director of Recognition Media, which runs advertising industry awards like the Webbys (for online work) and the Tellys (for local and cable TV shows and ads), along with the Communicators, said, “We try to keep our entry fees very low so that people aren’t out a lot of money and they can take a chance.”
235 2009-08-10 The French advertising giant Publicis Groupe struck a deal Sunday to buy Razorfish, the interactive agency that Microsoft has owned since acquiring the agency’s parent company, aQuantive, in 2007.

Publicis, which owns interactive agencies like Digitas, agreed to pay about $530 million in cash and stock for Razorfish. The deal had been widely expected.

After the deal closes, probably in the fourth quarter, Razorfish will maintain its current management as an autonomous unit of the VivaKi division of Publicis.

Microsoft held an auction for Razorfish, attracting bids from some of the most dominant names in advertising, among them the world’s largest agency company, WPP, and the largest agency company in Japan, Dentsu. (Publicis ranks fourth worldwide, behind WPP, the Omnicom Group and the Interpublic Group of Companies.)

The deal is “another step forward in realizing our strategic vision of building a world leader in digital communications, a critically important space for our clients,” Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis in Paris, said in a statement.
236 2009-08-10 Crowded classes may not be as harmful in lecture courses, but in creative and performing studios, increasing class size is not always an option, he added. “You can’t teach painting to 40 students or give that many students voice lessons in opera or jazz.”

Several other college arts administrators around the country also said programs that serve the surrounding community as well as the students — like museums and performing arts centers — are especially vulnerable.

In California figuring out which programs and positions will survive will take a few more weeks. In the meantime the School of the Arts and Architecture, like other sections of U.C.L.A., has been told it should search for more ways to raise money itself. “We’re looking at more summer classes for high school seniors and bake sales,” Mr. Waterman said.

Elsewhere on the campus the Film & Television Archive is paring back its foreign-film program “because we cannot afford shipping any more of those prints from foreign countries,” said Jan-Christopher Horak, the archives director. A smaller staff in the film studies center could translate into less academic research, he added. As public universities watch state legislators slice away their funds, private colleges have seen their endowments shrink. Both are having to rely more on private donations at the same time that the has left individual contributors less able to give.

Figuring out what or who faces the budgetary guillotine has been a harrowing process no matter how it was done. Few go quietly.

Officials at Washington State University held a dozen public forums, testified before state lawmakers, appeared before the student council, the Faculty Senate and the Board of Regents; they responded to thousands of electronic messages and spoke with every single student, legislator, faculty and staff member, alumnus and community member who requested a meeting before deciding where $54 million and 360 jobs over the next two years would come from. One result: Sports management got a reprieve; that program and major will continue, while theater arts and dance will be phased out.

’s four campuses lost 500 jobs, closed 48 programs and imposed 10-to-15-day furloughs this spring. The schools of music, theater, film and design were all incorporated into the existing art and architecture center. Virgil Renzulli, the university’s media spokesman, said that officials focused on slashing administrative costs to maintain the same number of courses and tenured faculty.

In , Northern Arizona University spread the $21.3 million in cuts across departments. “The only program that we eliminated was a B.A. in theater education,” said Tom Bauer, assistant director of public affairs. “It only had 15 students, and they will be allowed to finish.” He added that the university is still waiting to hear from the governor’s office how much federal stimulus money might be directed its way.

Like California, has had a tough year, although the doomsday cuts that some administrators were forecasting have not come to pass. Laurence Kaptain, dean of the College of Music and Dramatic Arts at Louisiana State University, said, “We tried to save people and cut things in our operations.” The college, which took a 3 percent cut this year on top of a 10 percent reduction last year, is holding back on upgrading computers and production technology, spending less on costumes, scenery and special effects as well as travel and conferences. “It’s making us more dependent on private funds,” he said.

Over at Louisiana State’s College of Art & Design the dean, David Cronrath, said a 4 percent cut ate up the positions of three full-time tenure-track faculty members, eight adjunct faculty and two staff members. He hopes to offer the same number of courses by increasing the faculty members’ loads and by relying more on graduate-student teaching assistants and part-time faculty, he said. But he, like others around the country, expects more cuts despite federal stimulus money.

For some institutions many tough decisions are yet to come. , for example, recently approved long-term capital projects, including a $20 million extension to its art museum and a $55 million building for the College of Architecture, Art and Planning, said Simeon , a university spokesman. But the university is also undertaking a top-to-bottom evaluation in the face of a projected operating deficit of approximately $150 million within five years.

Although some arts advocates, faculty and students have complained that their subjects are saddled with a disproportionate share of the cuts, Sally E. McRorie, the dean of visual arts, theater and dance at Florida State University, said that did not happen in her case.

“Florida State has a long history of dedication and in the arts,” she said. “Our cuts have not been greater than anybody else’s.” She said the university made a decision to use federal stimulus money “to keep people employed” but noted that after next year, when “those funds are gone, I’m not sure if we’ll be able to maintain those positions.”
237 2009-08-10 Silverman turned to satellite images of the city, and one day, as he examined the layout of ’s busy, city-owned Dyker Beach Golf Course, he saw a boomerang-shaped swath of land next to the back nine.

“It was 14 acres of high grass — a vacant out-of-bounds area, used for nothing but collecting wayward golf shots for 80 years,” Silverman said.

Dyker Beach is not only a teeming and picturesque golf course with sweeping views of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, but it is also where 35 years ago, , then an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at nearby Fort Hamilton, learned to play golf.

So there was more than a little symmetry last June, when the City Parks Foundation opened its new Junior Golf Center on what had been abandoned land next to Dyker Beach’s fairways.

Those Tiger Woods-inspired phone calls of 1997 have bred a beautiful practice and learning center, including a clubhouse with a classroom where golf’s rudiments, rules and etiquette are taught, as well as a 12-stall hitting area enclosed in netting and a six-hole course. Use of the center and its training programs is free, and the only adults who can play the course are those accompanied by children.

The center, which cost $8 million, was backed by sponsorship from , Top-Flite and the United States Golf Association. With new Callaway junior golf clubs provided, equipment for the participants is free as well.

“People think golf is a suburban thing, but city kids can learn to love the game, too,” said Hannah Youssef, a -year-old from who was introduced to the game by the city programs when she was 5 and is now a regular at the complex. “Maybe nobody has ever heard of a Lebanese golfer from New York like me. And right now, I am the only one in my family playing golf, but my friends want me to teach them. I’m going to come back someday and teach kids here, too.”

Sarah Soo-Hoo, 15, takes the subway to Dyker Beach from her home in . She and Hannah are among about 2,000 children as young as 6 using the Dyker Beach complex this summer.

“My friends will see me walking with my clubs and say: ‘What are you going to play golf for? That’s a rich white person’s sport,’ ” Sarah said. “And I’ll tell them: ‘No, it’s not. Everybody plays golf. Come to Brooklyn with me. You’ll see.’ ”

The Dyker Beach complex is far from the only junior golf initiative in New York City, or the rest of the country. The First Tee, created by the World Golf Foundation in 1997 with several corporate and golf industry partners, has introduced the sport to 2.9 million children and teenagers nationwide. First Tee programs are in more than 2,800 elementary schools.

In New York, the First Tee of Metropolitan New York was created eight years ago as a joint venture between the Metropolitan Golf Association Foundation and the Metropolitan Section of the P.G.A. and has provided affordable and accessible facilities to young players at several sites. Its main chapter is in the , at Mosholu Golf Course.

What is most impressive about the First Tee is that it integrates a life-skills curriculum into the physical act of teaching golf. Beginners, for example, may learn putting technique and the golf grip. But the program will also train students in five steps how to meet someone new: face the other person; smile and look him or her in the eye; give a firm handshake; state your name clearly and loudly enough to be heard; if you need information, ask a question.

Beginning golfers are mixed in groups that change daily. Introductions, done the First Tee way, take place on the first tee every day.

Succeeding levels of students deal with advancing educational missions, like interpersonal skills, career guidance, goal setting and learning to appreciate diversity. All are taught with the golf.

Since 1994, the Metropolitan Golf Association Foundation has also conducted a student intern program called GolfWorks, which provides more than 220 high school-age students a year with paid summer internships in area golf clubs.

All these initiatives focus on a hidden growth sector for golf: the children of our cities. These programs prove that even in crowded places, where golf may not be embedded in the neighborhood culture, the game can flourish and golfers can be nurtured.

“I want to be a lawyer,” said Caitlin Lopes, a 16-year-old Bronx resident who was selected last week to attend a weeklong First Tee life skills and leadership academy in . “I came to the golf course originally to learn golf, but it has taught me so many techniques and tips on how to deal with people, on how to solve problems, how to compromise and how to persevere when you don’t get the result you hoped for the first time you try.

“These things have helped me with my school studies and in test taking. They’ve made me focus on the other things I want in life. The golf course gives me someplace to go and relax in the middle of the city. It gives me exercise. And I learned to think for myself. It’s like they say, ‘It’s so much more than a game.’ ”

259 2009-08-11 WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department’s $700 billion bailout program has stabilized the banking system, but it has done little to prod banks to fully deal with the troubled loans on their books, a Congressional oversight panel said in a report to be released Tuesday.

The Troubled Asset Relief Program was originally conceived as a program for the government to buy troubled and unsalable mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.

But the Treasury has never actually used the program to buy assets, in part because it was faster to invest money directly into the nation’s banks and in part because banks have not wanted to sell their problem loans and book the loss in their value.

“The nation’s banks continue to hold on their books billions of dollars in assets about whose proper valuation there is a dispute and that are very difficult to sell,” the panel said in its latest monthly report.

As a result, it warned, many banks could find themselves short of capital if the economy suffered another downturn and their losses on troubled loans soared.
260 2009-08-11 With the apparent killing of the leader by an American , seems to be having some success with his military policy for . He is having less luck in Washington.

Congress left town for its summer recess without passing a long-promised bill to triple American economic and development assistance to Pakistan — the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s plan to win the hearts and minds of the Pakistani people.

The drone strike came after months of improved cooperation between American and Pakistani intelligence officials. Mr. Mehsud and his network have orchestrated a bloody reign of terror across Pakistan and are blamed for the 2007 assassination of , the former prime minister, and last year’s bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which left more than 50 people dead. Permanently removing him from the picture would be an obvious victory.

However, force alone will not be enough to defeat the extremists. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama rightly criticized the Bush administration for overinvesting in Pakistan’s army while doing far too little to help build up its civil society — the schools, courts, and roads that are essential to stability. Mr. Obama pledged to support legislation — which was initially sponsored by then-Senator and Senator Richard Lugar — that would provide Pakistan with $7.5 billion in development assistance over five years.

The aid — and particularly its pledge of five years of uninterrupted help — is intended to demonstrate that this time Washington is in for the long haul. Many Pakistanis still accuse the Americans of using and then abandoning them after the Soviet defeat in . We fear that any more delay on the promised assistance would only reinforce that suspicion and bitterness.

The House and Senate did manage to pass bills authorizing the aid, but with significant differences.

Both versions contained sound conditions and benchmarks to try to measure the effectiveness of the help. But the House added a variety of other provisions, including earmarks for military projects that favored American contractors and bullying language on Pakistan’s nuclear program that would inevitably increase tensions with Islamabad and alienate the Pakistani public. We, too, are very concerned about Pakistan’s history of nuclear proliferation. But this aid bill is clearly not the vehicle.
261 2009-08-11 There is new evidence that breast-feeding is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer among a group of younger women who are at particularly high risk: those with breast cancer in the family.

Although several studies have found that lactation is protective against breast cancer, the new report found little effect for premenopausal women over all. But for women with an immediate relative, like a mother or a sister, who had breast cancer, those who breast-fed had a 59 percent lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer. That is closer in line with the risk for women who had no disease in the family, the study found.

“I was sort of stunned,” said Dr. Alison M. Stuebe, the first author of the study and an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “It’s an impressive reduction in risk. Other studies either hadn’t looked at this or didn’t include enough women with a family history to find a statistically significant difference.”

The new study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, used information from 60,075 participants in the second Harvard Nurses’ Health Study. More research is needed to replicate the findings and to show that the reduced risk is the result of breast-feeding, rather than some other factor common to women who breast-feed. But Dr. Stuebe suggested that breast-feeding may prove just as effective a strategy for high-risk women as the use of Tamoxifen, a drug that interferes with estrogen activity and is often used in high-risk women to reduce breast cancer risk.

Though breast-feeding is promoted primarily because it is linked to better health in babies, mothers seem to accrue long-term advantages. Studies have found that women who breast-fed are less likely to develop osteoporosis and ovarian cancer, as well as high blood pressure and heart disease decades later.
262 2009-08-11 Stories of stranded passengers — and there have been many thousands of such incidents in recent years — tend to be similar. Lack of information. Worsening cabin conditions, including bad air and toilets that are either filthy or even unworkable. Lack of food and drink. Mounting distress and claustrophobia. Some people getting sick, especially diabetics. A general sense of not having control over one’s fate. In some instances, passengers have sat on parked planes for more than 12 hours.

Like most regional jets, which account for more than half of the flights in the United States, the ERJ-145 has cramped quarters. There are 31 inches of seat space with 17-and-half inches of width. The aisle is narrow and there is a single toilet in the back.

What happened in Rochester to account for a planeload of passengers being subjected to another one of these events?

In a report on the incident in The Star-Tribune in Minneapolis, an ExpressJet spokeswoman, Kristy Nicholas, said that allowing passengers into the terminal “was not provided as an option” by the airport.

But the airport begs to differ. A diverted Delta aircraft landed after the Continental flight and went to a gate, where passengers were let off and sent by chartered bus to Minneapolis, Steven W. Leqve, the airport manager, said Monday.

“The bottom line is the airport was open and there was staff available to bring that airplane to the gate, park it and get those people into the terminal building. This was purely a decision by Continental and their dispatch people about how they wanted to handle that airplane,” he said.

Ms. Nicholas, the ExpressJet spokeswoman, said on Monday, “We are thoroughly reviewing the circumstances that prevented the passengers from getting off sooner.”

Julie King, a Continental spokeswoman, said of ExpressJet that “service provided to customers on this flight was completely unacceptable.” She said Continental was apologizing to customers and providing full refunds and travel vouchers.

As anyone who flies frequently knows, most flights are packed like cattle cars these days as airlines cut capacity. In their resistance to proposed passenger-rights legislation, airlines insist that the law — which would require airlines to let passengers off a plane that has been stranded for more than three hours — would introduce unintended consequences, like creating more flight cancellations.

Airlines have been less vocal about other provisions of proposed rights laws, like ones that require food, water, ventilation and working toilets for stranded passengers. Kate Hanni, executive director of FlyersRights.org, has helped preserve the passenger-rights legislation as part of the reauthorization spending bill for the Federal Aviation Administration.

When passengers from Flight 2816 finally got to Minneapolis around 9:15 a.m., they encountered a Continental agent who handed them “comment cards with an 800 number to call,” said Mr. Christin, who was still hopping mad about the ordeal on Monday.

He said, “I started thinking about how serious this was. Everybody has their own medical and emotional limitations; their own physical limitations. To put people at risk on all of those levels is unconscionable. How can they allow a situation like that to happen, when it could have been solved so easily, in so many ways?”
263 2009-08-11 The three groups also took a swipe at Mr. Cuomo’s office for effectively approving the trustees’ plan to pay out $136 million in grants last spring. Most of the money was donated to medical centers for humans, a specific cause the petition says Mrs. Helmsley had deleted from a “mission statement” that was supposed to lay the groundwork for distributing her wealth after her death in 2007.

Only $1 million of the $136 million went to organizations that have to do with animals, and of that, $900,000 was earmarked for nonprofit groups that handle seeing-eye dogs, according to officials of the three groups that filed the petition. The groups say that seeing-eye dogs serve people, and that serving people was not Mrs. Helmsley’s intention.

The remaining $100,000 went to one of the groups behind the petition, the A.S.P.C.A. “I guess the trustees view us as worthy of being a recipient of a grant,” said Edwin Sayres, its president and chief executive.

The groups that filed the petition take issue with what they called “the trustees’ disregard of Mrs. Helmsley’s express intent.” But they say in the court papers that they do not want to undo the grants the trustees made in the spring. Instead, they want the court to focus on future grants by the Helmsley trust.

“Who are these trustees to second-guess either Mrs. Helmsley’s wishes or the legitimacy of kindness and compassion for animals?” asked Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the Humane Society. A spokesman for Mrs. Helmsley’s estate and the Helmsley trust, Howard J. Rubenstein, referred a reporter to the trust’s Web site, where a 750-word statement is posted: “Did Leona Helmsley intend for this charitable trust to focus on the care and help of dogs, rather than people? Absolutely not,” the statement says”

The statement says the trustees issued no grants until Surrogate’s Court upheld their approach. The statement also says the attorney general’s office had reviewed that approach as the legal authority responsible for seeing that charities operate according to their intended purposes. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said, “The court, in a written decision, has agreed with our position.”

The petition says Mrs. Helmsley spelled out her wishes in 2003, when she filed the will and the mission statement, though she changed it a year later. The revised version dropped one of two purposes listed in the first one — “medical and health care services for indigent people, with emphasis on providing care for children.”

Harvey P. Dale, a professor of philanthropy and law at New York University, said this kind of lawsuit faces significant hurdles because beneficiaries, potential beneficiaries and donors generally do not have standing to intervene as the three charities are trying to do. In New York state, the attorney general typically does. Rick Avanzino, the president of Maddie’s Fund, acknowledged the difficulty of challenging the trustees when the three groups are not named in Mrs. Helmsley’s will or in the mission statement.

“There’s no question this is a huge hill to climb,” Mr. Avanzino said. “This phenomenal wealth is being redirected at the behest of male trustees who have chosen to ignore the direction and wishes of their benefactor.”

And Trouble? When last heard from, the dog was living quietly in Florida. Trouble made headlines, and received death threats, for the $12 million she left him. A judge knocked Trouble’s trust fund down to $2 million, enough to cover a $100,000-a-year security detail whose mission is to keep trouble away from Trouble.
264 2009-08-11 Q. If I eat a raw jalapeño pepper, my mouth is afire, my eyes water and my nose runs. How can some people eat pepper after pepper without pain? Have they destroyed the sensory receptors in their mouths and throats?

A. No receptors are destroyed, said Harry T. Lawless, a professor of food science at Cornell and an expert in the taste, smell and sensory evaluation of food. Instead, “people who eat a lot of the stuff tend to develop a tolerance that we call desensitization,” he said.

“There is nothing harmful in the capsaicin molecule, the active ingredient of hot peppers,” he said. “Capsaicin is kind of a harmless drug, and like any drug we develop a tolerance to it.”

One theory is that a neurotransmitter gets depleted so that people respond less vigorously to capsaicin the more they are exposed to it, he said.

The capsaicin molecule has both stimulating and anesthetic properties, Dr. Lawless said. In 1952, The Dublin Medical Press recommended it as a temporary cure for toothache, he said, and pharmacologists, particularly in Hungary, have studied this anesthetic property in related molecules.

“The antidote to the mouth burning and the eyes watering is to eat more,” Dr. Lawless said, “either right away or later.” Chronic desensitization seems to be a matter of long-term dietary change, he said, but there is also the short-term numbing effect.
265 2009-08-11 Best friends they may be, but are man and dog so entwined that they tend to take after one another in appearance?

It is one of those eternal, quirky questions, at least for dog owners. But only recently have scientists taken a close look in actual studies.

In 2004, researchers in San Diego found that subjects in a study were able to correctly match pictures of dog owners with their pets more often than not, but only when the dogs were purebreds. Simple traits like hair and size played a smaller role than things like facial expressions.

The same year, a psychologist at the University of South Carolina challenged the findings in a separate study, pointing out flaws in the study designs. When the San Diego researchers countered with a reanalysis that confirmed their initial findings, the debate seemed to be at a standstill.

Earlier this year, a scientist in England joined the fray with a study in which 70 subjects were asked to match pictures of 41 dog owners to one of several breeds. They were able to match successfully more than half the time, far better than chance.
266 2009-08-11 OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) — The McDonald’s Corporation said Monday that sales at stores open at least a year climbed 4.3 percent in July as the nation’s biggest hamburger chain benefited from budget-conscious consumers.

The company, based in Oak Brook, said that sales at American stores open at least a year climbed 2.6 percent because of new products, including McCafé espresso-based coffee.

European sales surged 7.2 percent, helped by growth in France and Britain. Sales for Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa rose 2.1 percent, as strength in Australia helped offset weakness in China. Longer operating hours also increased sales.

McDonald’s sales at restaurants open at a year, also called same-store sales, are a key indicator of performance because they measure growth at existing restaurants rather than newly opened ones.

Many companies that sell their products abroad convert sales from foreign currencies back to dollars when reporting financial results. When the dollar is stronger than those currencies, it results in fewer dollars in revenue.

McDonald’s results have benefited from consumers trading down to cheaper meal options in the recession, but its second-quarter profit declined 8 percent because of the stronger dollar and a year-ago gain. Results a year ago benefited from a better economy and stimulus checks, the company said.
267 2009-08-11 BEIJING — The toll from the already deadly Typhoon Morakot in the Pacific threatened to soar on Tuesday, as huge mudslides buried a rural village in south-central Taiwan and at least six apartment buildings in coastal China, leaving hundreds of people missing.

The Taiwan mudslide, triggered early Sunday by as much as eight feet of typhoon-spawned rain, was said by local residents to have buried as many as 600 people in the village of Hsiao-lin, but the figure could not be quickly verified.

In Pengxi, a mountain-ringed town in coastal China about 270 miles southwest of Shanghai, a landslide buried six four-story apartment buildings as residents slept at 10:30 p.m. Monday, local time. Rescuers pulled four survivors and two bodies from the debris, but were unable to say how many others were missing.

The slides threatened to sharply increase the death toll from a string of typhoons that have ravaged Pacific Asia in recent days. Typhoon Morakot is reported to have killed 8 people in China and at least 36 in Taiwan and the Philippines, with dozens more there reported missing.

Typhoon Etau, which struck Japan’s west coat on Monday, has killed 13 people and left 10 others missing, news agencies reported.
268 2009-08-11 Aesop was quite the fable-teller, but was he a student of bird behavior as well? A study in Current Biology suggests he might have been.

Christopher Bird of the University of Cambridge and Nathan J. Emery of Queen Mary University of London report that rooks, a relative of the crow, are able to use stones to raise the level of water in a container so they can reach a floating worm. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s similar to Aesop’s fable about the crow and the pitcher, in which a thirsty bird adds stones to raise the water level in a pitcher to drink from it.

Crows, rooks and other corvids are known for their tool use — using sticks as probes, for example, or fashioning hooks out of wire. Mr. Bird knew of a 1980s study in which a rook plugged a hole in its aviary to allow a pool of water to form. That led him to wonder if a corvid could do what is described in the fable.

They experimented with four captive rooks, presenting them with clear tubes partly filled with water with a bug floating on top, and piles of stones. Within a couple of trials the birds had figured out how many stones they needed to bring the bug within reach. “It was a remarkable combination of some understanding of the task with really rapid learning,” Mr. Bird said. The findings were published in Current Biology.

Rooks don’t use tools in the wild, because they don’t need to — they have easy access to food like carrion. But in captivity, they can be presented with a situation like this, where it pays to figure out how to perform a task. “This fits nicely with Aesop’s moral,” Mr. Bird said, “that necessity is the mother of invention.”

He suggested that Aesop (or whoever came up with the fable, since the tales are thought to have many origins) may have seen similar behavior in a crow — or perhaps a rook. “In folklore all members of the corvid family are just called crow,” he said. “So it might just as easily have been Aesop’s rook.”

296 2009-08-12 WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Pakistan’s nuclear facilities have come under attack from the Taliban and other groups, and there is a “genuine” risk that militants could seize weapons or bomb-making material, an article published in a West Point research group’s newsletter said.

The Combating Terrorism Center, which is housed at the United States Military Academy at West Point, published the article in the July edition of its Sentinel newsletter, copies of which were distributed widely on Tuesday.

The Pentagon, seeking to bolster Pakistan’s government in its fight against Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban forces, expressed satisfaction with security at the facilities.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are “comfortable with the security measures the Pakistani government, the Pakistani military have in place to ensure that their nuclear arsenal is safeguarded,” a Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, told reporters on Tuesday.

Written by Prof. Shaun Gregory, the director of the Pakistan Security Research Unit at the University of Bradford in Britain, the article described three attacks against Pakistan’s nuclear facilities and warned that sites in the country may be vulnerable to infiltration.
297 2009-08-12 Microsoft and Nokia, long adversaries in mobile phone technology, have agreed to a partnership to equip many Nokia cellphones with the Microsoft Office software, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement.

Microsoft’s lucrative Office line faces an emerging competitive threat from free Web-based word processing, spreadsheet and other software, especially from Google. And consumers are increasingly using their smartphones to do tasks that once could be done only on personal computers, Microsoft’s stronghold.

“This appears to be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” said Rob Enderle, an independent technology analyst.

The alliance, expected to be announced Wednesday, seems to be a pragmatic step by both companies, as each tries to cope with growing competitive threats.

Nokia, the world’s largest cellphone maker, is struggling in the smartphone market against rivals led by the iPhone from Apple and the BlackBerry by Research in Motion. The competition is increasing with the recent entry of phones using the Android software from Google.

Neither company would comment. The two companies said in an advisory that they would hold a conference call on Wednesday.

Nokia and Microsoft have been rivals for years in cellphone operating systems, with Nokia adopting Symbian software and shunning Windows Mobile. Despite few details, the Microsoft-Nokia alliance apparently extends only to Office.
298 2009-08-12 It hasn’t been a great time for the restaurateurs, but even so, Carol Baer, the owner of the Popover Café, has fared a little bit worse than most. It’s not just that her business is down like everyone else’s and that rising costs have been eating away at the possibility of profit. She and her husband also lost their life savings to a wheeler-dealer named Bernie Madoff, as did her 100-year-old mother.

Given how rough things have been for Ms. Baer, who has run the restaurant for 28 years, she could be forgiven if she was inclined occasionally to throw herself a little pity party.

Instead, the window of Ms. Baer’s restaurant, on the Upper West Side, invites passers-by to a very different kind of celebration, one that will take place on Aug. 19: “Neighborhood Gratitude Event,” a sign reads, promising attractions like a raffle and giveaways. “Come By and Say Hi to Carol.”

While Ms. Baer may have quietly worked on cultivating gratitude in the privacy of her own home (which she’s grateful to have), several other businesses in the neighborhood  an upscale clothing shop named Darryl’s Boutique, the Robert Stuart Salon  inspired her to sign up for Gratitude Day.

The event had already been initiated by Melissa Sones, a longtime resident of the Upper West Side. Ms. Sones, a consultant in public relations and marketing, works hard on being “in gratitude” on a regular basis; she often plays a meditation-on-gratitude CD while she brainstorms marketing ideas. She started cold-calling businesses she patronizes with the idea of a gratitude celebration about six weeks ago. So far, about 10 businesses have signed on, including Super Runners Shop and the gift shop Avventura.

Although gratitude is certainly Oprah-endorsed, it’s not exactly a buzzword one associates with this neighborhood, especially along Broadway, with its unforgiving rents and ever glossier chains. Ms. Sones, however, started her project on Amsterdam Avenue, where holdouts like Mr. Stuart (of the hair salon), Ms. Baer and Carrie Levin, owner of Good Enough to Eat, are still holding up the reputation of the old Upper West Side: home-grown, lefty, maybe even a little new-agey.

Ms. Levin, who believes in signs, and regrets only that the event isn’t on the 13th, swears that she had just browsed an inspirational reading about gratitude the morning Ms. Sones (a longtime customer) came in with the idea.

As for Mr. Stuart, he says that he is interested in thanking his clients for keeping him in business for 27 years, but that this event means more to him than that. “Even politically, where our country is at right now  it’s about how lucky we are to have a president who really cares. It kind of blends in with all this,” he said, “to be grateful for what we have and stand by that.”

At his hair salon on the day of the event  Mr. Stuart’s sign calls it a Gratitude Party  there will be balloons, free drinks and free consultations by Mr. Stuart all day long. There may be gratitude worksheet handouts for those who need a little help finding their own reasons to be grateful.

Ms. Baer, at the Popover Café, hasn’t yet determined the prize, but she’ll be collecting e-mail addresses for the raffle, which she plans to put to use for her own marketing purposes.

Yes, it’s a community feel-good event, a chance to snag free popovers with strawberry butter or advice on that tired shag cut, but it’s obviously also a marketing scheme  and frankly, a pretty clever one, especially compared with what’s going around. Some businesses are promising free wine to get shoppers in the door; others are going after customers with personal attention that borders on the desperate. When a friend received a note from the sales clerk at her favorite boutique  just to say hi and thanks so, so, so much for her business  she realized it was time she scaled back her shopping habit.

Of course, some of the businesses taking part in Gratitude Day are also offering free alcohol and saying thanks so, so, so much, but both approaches benefit from happening under the umbrella of the event. Being broke may never be chic, but counting one’s blessings is all the rage right now.

Ms. Baer for one, is grateful that her restaurant is still standing, whereas so many others have collapsed. Her husband still has his pension. Her mother, unlike another woman she learned of through her Madoff online support group, isn’t being forced to move from a nursing home for lack of funds. “And we have our health,” says Ms. Baer. “That comes at the front of the pack.”

300 2009-08-12 President Obama sent to Congress his proposal for reining in over-the-counter derivatives, including restrictions on municipalities and small investors seeking to trade in the $592 trillion industry.

The proposal includes a provision to better protect small municipalities and unsophisticated investors by limiting their eligibility to trade derivatives. The proposal mirrors earlier legislative outlines by asking Congress to impose higher capital and margin requirements, move most derivatives to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses, and impose supervision over all dealers.

Customized products that cannot be centrally cleared would have tighter restrictions.

The plan is part of a wider overhaul of financial industry rules meant to prevent a repeat of events last year, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers froze credit markets, worsened the recession and deepened losses for state and local governments.

The idea is to “encourage substantially greater use of standardized O.T.C. derivatives, and thereby to facilitate substantial migration of O.T.C. derivatives onto central clearinghouses and exchanges,” the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told House lawmakers at a hearing last month.

302 2009-08-12 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place fish skin-side down on a rimmed baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Smear lemon zest all over fillets and sprinkle with thyme. Dot top of fish with butter and sprinkle with almonds. Roast until fish is just opaque and almonds are starting to brown at edges, 6 to 9 minutes.

2. While fish cooks, sauté chard. Heat oil in a skillet and add garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Let cook for 30 seconds, then add chard. Sauté until chard is very tender, about 5 minutes. If pan starts to dry out before chard is cooked, mix in a tablespoon of water. Season with more salt, pepper and nutmeg. And serve with fish and lemon wedges.
303 2009-08-12 Brooklyn’s latest high-end hot dog can be found at Bark Hot Dogs, a rustic spot where high communal tables and stools are made of recycled wood. It opened on Aug. 11. The devisers of this little dream, Brandon Gillis, far left, and Joshua Sharkey, have pedigrees of their own, Mr. Sharkey in the kitchen at Café Gray and Mr. Gillis at Franny’s, a block away from Bark.

LOCAL, LOCAL, LOCAL The hot dogs are made with beef, or beef-and-pork by an Austrian sausage-meister upstate. Most of the condiments, including sauerkraut aged in chardonnay barrels, are homemade. Bark Hot Dogs serves its own ale, Bark Red from Sixpoint Craft Ales in Red Hook.

Bark Hot Dogs, 474 Bergen Street (Flatbush Avenue), Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-1939, opens at 7 a.m. and stays open until at least 10 p.m. Hot dogs start at $4.25.

Larry Bain, the chef and a partner of Let’s Be Frank, which has cafes and trucks in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles, has come up with a sweetly spicy, oniony concoction, Devil Sauce. Great on a sausage, and with a little sautéed ground pork and chopped fresh cilantro it’s dynamite on soba noodles.

Devil Sauce is sold at www.letsbefrankdogs.com, $9.50 for an 9-ounce jar.
304 2009-08-12 Many said they heard about the meeting from e-mail alerts sent by conservative and antitax groups like the Constitutional Organization of Liberty and the Berks County Tea Party, along with Mr. Specter’s own mailings. Some voiced sentiments that were heard recently on conservative radio shows, though those interviewed said they resented being characterized as mobs or puppets of lobbyists, emphasizing that they represented only themselves. “I demand my voice!” read one sign outside. “You work for me,” was a refrain yelled inside the auditorium.

At the same time, those who favor a health care overhaul, urged to attend by unions and liberal groups like the and Health Care for America Now, said they were motivated by concern that the government might not go far enough. Only the government, they say, can take on a problem as big as health care.

But in the end, their ability to ask a question at the meeting depended on how early they got in line. Many of the union members who showed up to support did not arrive early enough to get into the auditorium at the Harrisburg Area Community College, and thus were largely not represented among the 30 questioners called on by Mr. Specter. It was the angriest people who got in line first.

“All union members to the back, I got here early,” one man in the line told latecomers.

John Stahl, chairman of the Berks County Tea Party, a local branch of conservatives, was one of those who helped recruit opponents of change to the event. A former truck salesman, Mr. Stahl, 65, said he was laid off about 18 months ago. Since May, his group has organized four protests in the state opposing and the , but none have attracted the crowds like health care, he said.

“We believe there are several issues out there that leave the existence of the Republic at risk,” he added, “not the least of which is this Obamacare.”

The meeting came just over a week after Mr. Specter and Health and Human Services Secretary were booed and jeered at a meeting in on Aug. 3.

Hoping to avoid similar unrest, Mr. Specter tried to control the event by imposing a rigid format. Only the first 30 people who wanted to speak were given cards allowing them to ask questions. He allotted 90 minutes for the meeting and was careful to let people speak their piece. He gave succinct answers before moving on to the next question. Because of concerns about a potentially unruly crowd, the Capitol Police sent three extra officers from Washington.

In addition, Mr. Specter and his staff controlled the microphones. And he stood face to face with his questioners, a move, he said later in an interview, that he had hoped might make it harder for people to scream at him.

But for all his efforts, tempers boiled over 15 minutes into the meeting. Standing two feet from the senator, Craig Anthony Miller, 59, shouted, “You are trampling on our Constitution!” A half-dozen security people quickly swarmed but refrained from touching him as Mr. Specter, raising his voice, said sternly, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute!” He said the man had the right to leave.

Mr. Miller, shaking, stood his ground. He said he was furious that the senator’s staff had limited the questioning. “One day,” he said to loud applause, “God is going to stand before you, and he’s going to judge you!”

Mr. Specter shouted into his microphone that demonstrators disrupting the proceedings would be thrown out.

The meetings come at a vulnerable moment for Mr. Specter, who faces what could be a tight Democratic primary next spring. While those on the right excoriated him at the meeting for betrayal because he switched parties in April, he has also been attacked by his opponent in the primary, Representative , as being a Republican aligned with former President .

But most of those who spoke Tuesday seemed unlikely to vote in the Democratic primary. Many seemed concerned about issues that are either not in the health care legislation or are peripheral to the debate in Washington — , , coverage of immigrants, privacy.

“It says plainly right there they want to limit the type of care elderly can get,” said Laurel Tobias, an office manager from Lebanon, referring to a bill in the House. “They are talking about killing people.”

Standing by a bus that takes her from meeting to meeting, Amy Menefee, spokeswoman for Americans for Prosperity, said the real issue was the expansion of government favored by . Proponents of the overhaul voiced the opposite fear, also citing larger issues at stake.

“This isn’t just about health care,” said Carolyn Doric of Harrisburg, “it’s about political power and a means to regain political power.” Ms. Doric did not get into the meeting.
305 2009-08-12 The Knitting Factory, which ceased regular programming in TriBeCa at the end of last year after two decades in Manhattan, will reopen in a smaller space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Sept. 9, the club’s parent company, Knitting Factory Entertainment, announced. Located in the former space of the Luna Lounge — itself a Manhattan transplant — at 361 Metropolitan Avenue, the new club will present the Brooklyn band Les Savy Fav on its opening night, and future shows are to include Boss Hog, Rasputina, the No Neck Blues Band and Titus Andronicus, among others. The club’s lease on space on Leonard Street in TriBeCa expired in July.
306 2009-08-12 LOS ANGELES — An open invitation to a seminar for Muslim college students and recent graduates interested in Hollywood writing careers has placed the Writers Guild of America, West, at odds with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which was planning to hold the session on Tuesday.

In a news release dated July 29, the council’s Los Angeles-area chapter said it planned to join the guild in hosting a “Writing for Hollywood” seminar with “a leading Hollywood filmmaker and writer” at an undetermined location. The program was to include “an overview of resources and opportunities available at the guild” and a tour of the Writers Guild Foundation library, which is in the same building as the guild’s Los Angeles headquarters.

The planned seminar would have been unusual for the guild, said Daniel Petrie Jr., a former president who now serves on the governing board of its foundation. The writers’ union has conducted programs about employment discrimination for older or female members, he said, but appears not to have systematically reached out to specific religious groups.

“I got a call on Friday night from a member who was upset about it,” Mr. Petrie said. “It was the first I’d heard of it.”

The council has known its share of controversy. In 2007 federal prosecutors named it as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Texas terrorism trial involving the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, whose leaders were eventually convicted of supporting terrorism by channeling money to Hamas. The council strongly challenged the co-conspirator naming as being an unfair “demonization” of things Muslim.
307 2009-08-12 “Iglesias has done nothing,” it continued. “We are getting killed out there.”

Mr. Iglesias was ultimately let go in December 2006, along with seven other federal prosecutors in an unusual dismissal of top presidential appointees. Mr. Iglesias had received positive evaluations from the Justice Department in Washington for his performance and his “exemplary leadership.” It is unclear who made the final decision to have him dismissed.

“The amount of backstabbing and treachery involved is just breathtaking,” Mr. Iglesias said of the White House e-mail, in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s astounding that without reviewing the evidence or talking to the or anything, the White House would assume that these were provable cases and that I needed to file them for the political benefit of the party. That’s not what U.S. attorneys do.”

Robert Luskin, a lawyer for Mr. Rove, said the material released Tuesday demonstrated that there was “absolutely no evidence” the White House had used inappropriate political motivations to punish federal prosecutors. Mr. Luskin said Mr. Rove and other White House aides were legitimately concerned about voter fraud and were debating “completely reasonable and legitimate policy questions.”

Bush administration officials have publicly suggested that Mr. Iglesias was dismissed because of a subpar performance and absences from the office — he was a reservist.

Those issues do not surface in the newly released e-mail. Rather, the dissatisfaction of New Mexico Republicans over the investigations was the focus in 2005 and 2006. Nonetheless, one message shows that the White House was told that the Justice Department planned to say the New Mexico investigations played no role in the dismissal.

In that exchange, in February 2007, William K. Kelly, of the White House Counsel’s Office, wrote an e-mail message to several senior officials, including Fred Fielding, the White House counsel, and , the press secretary. Referring to the Justice Department, Mr. Kelly wrote, “They are planning to deny that the investigation in question played any role in DOJ’s decision, and to deny that any Member contacted main Justice to complain about the conduct (or not) of any particular investigation.”

In fact, Senator , Republican of New Mexico, had called Attorney General to complain about Mr. Iglesias and his failure to bring voting fraud cases. The messages also show that Mr. Domenici had contacted , the White House chief of staff, about removing the United States attorney. And the senator’s staff had contacted the White House to complain about Mr. Iglesias’s failure to pursue a corruption case against local Democratic officials in New Mexico.

In closed testimony last month before Congressional investigators, , a White House counsel under Mr. Bush, recalled getting a telephone call from a “very agitated” Mr. Rove in the fall of 2006, making clear to her that he wanted action taken against Mr. Iglesias.

“It was clear to me that he felt like he has a serious problem and that he wanted something done about it,” Ms. Miers said, recalling the call from Mr. Rove. “He was just upset. I remember his being upset.”

In a recent interview, Mr. Rove said he viewed himself as only passing the complaints about Mr. Iglesias on to Ms. Miers.

Ms. Miers said she could not explicitly recall being asked to have Mr. Iglesias fired. But she called the deputy attorney general, Paul McNulty, to ask him to follow up on the matter.

“He is getting lots of complaints,” Ms. Miers recalled telling Mr. McNulty, referring to Mr. Rove. “And it was a problem.” Ms. Miers did not reply to a message for comment on Tuesday.

The Senate Ethics Committee last year admonished Mr. Domenici for his efforts to have Mr. Iglesias removed.

The documents also provide new evidence about Mr. Rove’s push to have an aide and protégé, Timothy Griffin, tapped as United States attorney in to replace Bud Cummins, who was told to resign. “It was no secret I was for him,” Mr. Rove acknowledged to the Congressional investigators.

Even so, the Justice Department in February 2007 told members of Congress in a letter as the controversy was unfolding that it was “not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the decision to appoint Mr. Griffin.” Both Mr. Rove and Ms. Miers distanced themselves from the letter in their Congressional testimony, saying the Justice Department’s statements were incomplete and in some cases inaccurate.

A federal prosecutor, , is continuing to investigate the firings, including whether officials gave false or misleading statements to Congress. The testimony of Mr. Gonzales, the former attorney general who resigned amid the controversy over the firings, appears to have received particular scrutiny, according to lawyers with knowledge of the case.

A separate review released last year by the Justice Department inspector general faulted Mr. Gonzales’s misstatements to Congress about the firings and his “extraordinary lack of recollection about the entire removal process.”
308 2009-08-12 The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, created in the 1950s to break the mob’s grip on the docks, became its own bastion of lawlessness, employing some of the same corrupt, self-serving methods as the gangsters it was supposed to pursue, investigators said Tuesday in a scathing report.

Top officials at the $11-million-a-year bistate agency divided spoils, helped cronies evade the law and thwarted security provisions meant to safeguard the port against terrorism, according to the report by the New York State inspector general, which capped a nearly two-year investigation in 2007 and 2008 that the commission had sought to block in court.

As a result of the findings, virtually the entire executive staff has been ousted  with the New Jersey commissioner, Michael J. Madonna, a former police officer and union representative, dismissed last week, the commission revealed. The former New York commissioner, Michael C. Axelrod, who was also faulted for abuses, was not reappointed after his term ended last year.

New leadership was put in place starting last year.

“It was an utter disaster when we stepped in,” the inspector general, Joseph Fisch, said in an interview, calling the state of affairs then “a remnant and continuation of the old waterfront.”

Largely unscrutinized for more than half a century, the commission is a throwback to days when the gun and the knife ruled the nation’s shipping lifeline and a screenwriter named Budd Schulberg, who died last week, captured the violence and heroics for a film that became a classic, “On the Waterfront.”

With 100 employees and offices in Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Port Newark, the commission, created in 1953, licenses the 52 companies now operating on the waterfront and maintains a registry of nearly 6,500 longshoremen and other workers.

The 61-page report, deploring a “complete breakdown of the commission’s audit and enforcement functions,” found that the commission’s general counsel, Jon Deutsch, later fired, masterminded a scheme to conceal a convicted felon’s ownership of a company so he could continue to operate on the waterfront. It also found that federal antiterrorism grants were misused or could not be accounted for, calling for further investigation by the Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. Deutsch, reached at home, said he had not yet read the report. Later, his lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg of Newark, called the inquiry “a witch hunt,” saying Mr. Deutsch had “persuasively rebutted every single one of the allegations” and had been denied a look at the draft. But Mr. Lustberg declined to cite any specifics.

The reported failings ranged from the critical to the comical. The report said the commission  often stalemated by differences between the two $43,500-a-year commissioners  abandoned background checks on the longshoremen who unload ships and the stevedoring companies that employ them, creating a critical breach in the nation’s security web. Instead, the report said, commission detectives spent their mornings parked in the commissioners’ designated parking spots in Lower Manhattan, guarding them from interlopers.

It portrayed the agency as a patronage-laden favor bank where staff members took cars for personal use, a boat that was bought with federal money to fend off a “waterborne attack” was used primarily to ferry V.I.P.’s during Fleet Week, and friends got friends jobs with high salaries and little work.

One detective failed his entry exam twice, for example  until Commissioner Madonna himself slipped him the test, the report said, and he ended up turning in the highest score in the history of the commission.

The detective later lied under oath about the matter and tried to get colleagues to falsely back him up, the report said. adding that the matter had been referred to the Manhattan district attorney for further investigation. Mr. Fisch said new leadership under the current New York State commissioner, Ronald Goldstock, a director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force from 1981 to 1994, and a new executive director, Walter M. Arsenault, a former Manhattan homicide prosecutor, had implemented changes. “The commission investigated by the inspector general clearly no longer exists,” Mr. Arsenault said.

No one answered the phone at Mr. Madonna’s home in New Jersey. The inspector general wrote that Mr. Madonna “acknowledged that many problems existed in the agency, but refused to accept any responsibility,” placing the blame on commission staff members. Mr. Axelrod did not respond to a message left at his Long Island law office.

The waterfront was long notorious. The longshoremen’s union was once known as the “pistol local” because of frequent gunfire and murders, wrote Thomas A. Reppetto in his book “American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power” (Henry Holt, 2004); on rumors that one or another informer was about to squeal, high New York politicians suddenly dropped re-election plans.

In 1953, with Washington calling the port “a national disgrace,” President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed enabling legislation for a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor “to investigate, deter, combat and remedy criminal influence in the Port of New York and New Jersey.”

But who, over the next half a century and more, was watching the Waterfront Commission?

No one, the inspector general reported. Only once in its more than 55 years was the agency examined  in 2005, when the New York State comptroller audited its hiring practices. But little came of it

The investigation, generated by an employee complaint, was referred to the inspector general’s office in May 2007 by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. His successor, David A. Paterson, who appointed Mr. Fisch, authorized expansion of the inquiry in cooperation with the office of the New Jersey governor, Jon S. Corzine.

Commissioner Madonna fought the investigators’ subpoena, until a federal court forced compliance, the report said.

“The most egregious instances of misconduct” were committed by the general counsel and former licensing director, Mr. Deutsch, who was “plagued with conflicts of interest” before being dismissed last October, the report said. It said he covered up the drug-related arrest of a former state senator’s son who was hired for a stevedoring job and intervened on behalf of a friend’s father, Albert Cernades Sr., a longshoremen’s union official later indicted in a federal inquiry.

And, it said, Mr. Deutsch “fashioned a scheme” to allow a felon, Frank Cardaci, who had been convicted of federal charges of illegal domestic sales of goods intended for foreign shipment, to hide his ownership of a waterfront warehouse by placing it in his wife’s name.

It also found that none of the 53 stevedoring companies supervised by the commission had been granted permanent five-year licenses, as required, and that payroll audits of them were as much as 14 years behind.
309 2009-08-12 The productivity of American workers grew in the second quarter at the fastest rate in almost six years as employers slashed payrolls to bolster profits.

Productivity, a measure of how much an employee produces for each hour worked, rose at an annual rate of 6.4 percent, more than forecast, after a 0.3 percent gain in the prior three months, the Labor Department said. Labor costs fell by the most in eight years.

Lower expenses mean companies may need to lay off fewer workers as sales stabilize, the first step toward ending the worst employment slump in the post-World War II era. Efficiency gains also help curb inflation, giving Federal Reserve policy makers, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, extra time to remove stimulus.

“This is good for the cost structure of companies,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “The Fed will be encouraged on the inflation story. They have taken a lot of heat on the exit strategy. Certainly there is no rush to exit.”

A report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed inventories at wholesalers fell in June almost twice as much as forecast, as growing sales helped distributors cut excess supply.

The 1.7 percent decrease in stockpiles followed a revised 1.2 percent decline in May. Wholesale inventories have had the longest series of declines since records began in 1987. Purchases climbed 0.4 percent in June for a second month.
310 2009-08-12 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — An American missile hit the Mehsud tribal region of South Waziristan on Tuesday, killing at least 10 people in the same area where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban was apparently killed in a drone attack last week, Pakistani security officials said.

The missile struck near the town of Kani Gurram, one of the largest in the area, which is home to the Pakistani Taliban movement. American and Pakistani security officials say they believe the leader of the movement, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a drone strike by the C.I.A. last Wednesday.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

Details of the strike on Tuesday were unclear. Reuters reported that the missile had apparently hit a house that was being used by the Taliban, but it was not clear if the attack killed any Taliban commanders. Many of them have reportedly gathered in the area in order to choose Mr. Mehsud’s successor.

More deaths could be extremely damaging for the Taliban, whose ranks — according to Pakistani security officials — are in disarray after the death of Mr. Mehsud. Pakistan’s military says it wants to exploit that weakness but is waiting for the right moment.

“Now it’s a fluid situation,” a Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said in an interview. “One would like the dust to settle first.”

321 2009-08-13 Parents may want to lock the medicine cabinet as well as the cabinet under the sink. A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that more than twice as many children are accidentally poisoned with prescription or over-the-counter medicines as with household consumer products.

The researchers estimate that more than 70,000 children under 18 visit emergency rooms yearly suffering from unintentional medication overdoses, compared with about 30,000 for poisonings with other products. Most of the affected children have ingested medicines without their parents’ knowledge, but 8 percent of emergency room visits and 14 percent of hospitalizations were the result of parents accidentally overdosing their offspring. More than 75 percent of the medication overdoses were in children under 5.

Dr. Daniel S. Budnitz, the senior author and an epidemiologist with the C.D.C., said that the study did not count visits to private physicians’ offices or other health care facilities, so the numbers are probably an underestimate.

The study, published in the August issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, found that the drug most commonly implicated in poisoning was acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands), with opioid painkillers and benzodiazepine antianxiety drugs close behind.

Dr. Budnitz said that parents should of course keep medications out of the reach of children, but that packaging improvements are also important. “Child safety caps came out in the 1970s and haven’t changed much,” he said. “There are packaging improvements that can be made, and we’re working with manufacturers and other federal agencies to encourage this.

333 2009-08-13 As a mortgage banker and broker for 28 years, I agree with Mr. Conley’s contention that there are ways to increase access to home purchases for low-income families. But instead of an expensive mortgage insurance program for “low-wealth” home buyers, it would be far easier to set up better risk disclosures.

Anyone applying for an adjustable rate mortgage in the 1980s, for example, had to read and acknowledge that he or she understood a worst-case scenario. This meant explaining what the monthly payment could be at the maximum interest rate.

I saw those requirements slowly edited out of the application packages in the 1990s, as the real estate boom picked up steam. And by this decade, when subprime loans became common, there were few requirements, if any, to disclose those risks. It was up to conscientious lenders and brokers to fill the knowledge gap.

Now we know why. The lenders, and perhaps their investors, didn’t want to know about those risks either.

335 2009-08-13 An analysis by Jonathan Gruber, a respected health economist at the , concluded that those small businesses that are not exempt would see little impact on employment or profits, although employers would reduce wages to compensate for providing added benefits. The nonpartisan , the chief arbiter of the impact of legislation, has come to similar conclusions.

What’s been most lost in the furor is how much most small businesses would benefit from provisions that should make insurance more affordable — for businesses that already provide coverage and for those that have been deterred from providing coverage by cost.

Small businesses that currently offer coverage often pay significantly more per worker than larger employers do for the same coverage. Under all of the current bills, the smallest employers would gain quick access to new insurance exchanges — where plans would compete for their business with rates comparable to those enjoyed by large employers. (In subsequent years, slightly bigger firms and possibly even medium-size firms would likely gain access to the exchanges as well.)

And many small businesses with low-wage workers would be eligible for substantial credits to subsidize their coverage.

Still, not all small firms would benefit. One government estimate suggests that 39,000 firms (out of a total of six million small and large employers in the country) would have to start providing benefits or pay a penalty, and another 240,000 that do provide benefits would have to increase their subsidy levels. The penalties for not offering coverage could be relatively small ($750 per worker after exempting the first 25 workers under the Senate bill) or quite substantial (reaching an estimated $2,800 per worker for some firms under the House bill).

There is no question that the cost of coverage — which currently averages about $5,000 per individual or $13,000 per family — or paying fines could take a substantial bite out of the profits of some firms, forcing them to accept lower earnings, reduce wages, shed some jobs or raise prices.

Trade groups say the main reason small firms don’t provide coverage is that they can’t afford to, and they complain that there is little in the reform bills that would reduce medical costs any time soon. But in making that argument, they conflate two issues. It is true that deep-seated reform of the health care delivery system will take years to reduce medical costs. But the cost of for small businesses could drop quickly once the exchanges are open.

While some small percentage of companies will suffer, there are good reasons for requiring as many companies as possible to “play” — by offering coverage — or “pay” by paying a penalty. The most important is that the penalties would help deter employers from dropping their own coverage. The number of companies offering health insurance to their workers has been declining steadily, mostly among small firms, and it is important not to accelerate that erosion.

The play-or-pay provisions could also raise significant money to help cover the uninsured. The penalties alone could raise $52 billion over a decade under the Senate health committee bill and probably much more under the House bill. We see no easy way to ease the pain of the minority of firms that will face very substantial new costs. We’d be inclined to suggest hardship exemptions were it not for the likelihood that creative accountants might make every firm look like a hardship case.

A bipartisan group within the Senate Finance Committee is considering dropping the employer mandate and substituting a requirement that employers pay only for those workers who end up with government-subsidized coverage. That seems a poor approach because it could deter employers from hiring low-income workers that could saddle them with high subsidy costs.

It makes good sense to us to require small businesses to contribute to solving a problem that mostly affects their own workers. There also seems little doubt that the small business community would be one of the biggest winners from health care reform.
336 2009-08-13 Among the options the committee has to consider is whether to retire the space shuttle in 2010 as planned, or extend its life to 2011 or beyond, whether to dump the International Space Station in the ocean in 2016 (for which there is no money in the budget), whether to continue developing the Ares 1 and Ares 5 rockets to replace the shuttle, or to build something else — and, of course, where to go in these shiny new rockets.

Many committee members agreed that political considerations made it likely that the space station would survive and that the space shuttle would probably fly at least until 2011, and that some options should show that, but they argued about what other options should be in “the Chinese menu,” in the words of Jeff Greason, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace.

Unable to fit anything into the official budget, Dr. Ride and her colleagues tried to see how various programs would fit into an “unconstrained budget,” which would be allowed to overshoot it by up to $3 billion a year, then grow with inflation.

The best fit in that case was something called “Deep Space,” which would involve flybys of asteroids, the Moon or Mars and other interesting places in deep space, but not necessarily landing on the Moon or Mars. Under that plan, Dr. Ride reported, there could be missions every other year in the 2020s past asteroids and Mars and even a landing on the Moon by 2029 or 2030.

As the afternoon wore on, the participants wrestled with whether to retain the goal of a direct flight to Mars.

Mr. Greason said that he had dreamed of going to Mars his whole life, but that making a “dash” for Mars would be destructive of the dream, leading to its abandonment the way Americans abandoned the Moon. “I want to go to Mars, but not this way,” he said. “I want to go the right way.”

But Bohdan Bejmuk, a former Boeing manager and aerospace consultant who helped develop the space shuttle, said, “By God, I think we should go to Mars.”

Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut, also argued for keeping Mars as an option. “Let the decision makers know what it would it cost,” he said.

In the end, the committee agreed to treat Mars not as an option, but as the end goal of all options.
337 2009-08-13 Earlier studies had shown that people who took aspirin regularly were less likely to develop tumors of the colon, but the new study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to have found that patients who had colorectal cancer and took aspirin survived longer.

One colon cancer expert who commented on the recent study called it “remarkable” and “revolutionary.” But then his patients started seeking advice, and he was more circumspect.

“It’s one thing to talk philosophically,” said the expert, Dr. Alfred I. Neugut, an oncologist from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University who wrote an enthusiastic editorial on the study in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association. “But this is only one study. To know that it’s true, it needs to be repeated. Every experiment needs to be repeated once.”

The new study was not a controlled clinical trial, where patients are randomly assigned to receive either a particular treatment or a placebo. That kind of study is considered the gold standard for determining clinical recommendations in medicine, but it is also far more expensive and cumbersome. Observational studies, like this new one, can be weaker or misleading.

One clinical trial is under way in Asia, where the National Cancer Center of Singapore is enrolling 2,660 patients with nonmetastatic disease in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Singapore, who will continue their treatment and be randomly assigned to either get aspirin or a placebo daily for up to three years, according to the National Cancer Institute Web site.

Most colorectal cancer tumors are positive for cyclooxygenase-2, or COX-2, an enzyme that is not expressed in a healthy colon but flares up under certain circumstances. The enzyme appears to be involved in fueling abnormal cell growth and contributing both to the development and spread of the cancer, said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, the author of the new study.

Aspirin’s anti-cancer property is believed to be linked to its action as a COX-2 inhibitor.

A clinical trial of another COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, which has the brand name Celebrex, is in the planning stages and will be enrolling patients early next year, Dr. Chan said. Although more is known about aspirin’s effects on preventing colorectal polyps and tumors than other cancers, some studies have also hinted that aspirin could reduce the risk of developing breast, lung and prostate cancers, which are also associated with inflammation, Dr. Brawley said.

“It seems like — and we’re still talking in theory in some instances here — there is a relationship between inflammation and cancer in certain tumors,” Dr. Brawley said. “And these drugs appear to be beneficial because they are anti-inflammatory, and they inhibit inflammation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.”

The new colorectal cancer study found not only that patients who took aspirin regularly after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer had a better chance of survival than those who did not, but also that those who had tumors that overexpressed the COX-2 enzyme were particularly responsive to the aspirin.

Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School, warned about the risks of using even small doses of aspirin on a daily basis, saying that in a large women’s health study, half doses of baby aspirin were associated with a 40 percent increase in serious gastrointestinal bleeds that required transfusions.

But, she acknowledged, patients who already have colorectal cancer may feel they do not have the luxury of waiting for additional results.

“I don’t think everyone should be running out and taking aspirin,” she said, “But there may be some patients who would benefit from it at this point; and if they talk with their doctors they may learn they’re reasonable candidates, and some of them may not be in a position to wait.”
338 2009-08-13 The opposition leader and Nobel Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi called this week’s verdict that returned her to house arrest for 18 months “totally unfair” on Wednesday, but she remains cheerful and alert, one of her lawyers said. The sentence ensures that she will remain in detention, with limited communications, through a parliamentary election that is scheduled for next year. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s lawyers were allowed to visit her at her lakeside home for an hour to discuss an appeal of her conviction Tuesday on charges of violating the terms of her previous house arrest. A Myanmar court found her guilty of sheltering an uninvited American visitor.
339 2009-08-13 When Arthur J. Samberg abruptly announced the closing of his $3 billion hedge fund in May, Wall Street buzzed that regulators were coming after him for improper trading.

Those rumors were confirmed this week when Mr. Samberg told his clients that federal regulators intended to bring a civil action against him and his firm, Pequot Capital Management.

Mr. Samberg, renowned as a money manager, withstood an investigation in 2006, only to have it reopened late last year. In a letter to clients on Monday, he reiterated his longstanding position: Pequot had done nothing wrong.

But the Securities and Exchange Commission is pressing its case. Mr. Samberg, 68, and Pequot received so-called Wells notices about six weeks ago, signaling that the commission plans to bring enforcement action, said a person close to the investigation, who had signed confidentiality agreements. A spokesman for the S.E.C., citing policy in such matters, declined to comment.

It was unclear whether Pequot was trying to reach a settlement with the S.E.C., but Mr. Samberg, in his letter to Pequot clients, said that the allegations were “without merit” and that Pequot would defend itself vigorously. A spokesman for Pequot declined to comment.

“We do not believe this development impacts the process of liquidating the remaining securities in the Pequot funds,” Pequot said in its letter.
340 2009-08-13 But Defense Department officials from nearby Bern, the capital, argued that it would be too dangerous to remove them and too costly, if a method were used that involved blowing the accumulated sediment off the munitions, then freezing them in blocks of ice and lifting them.

In 2006, Parliament rejected Ms. Haller’s motion and has since pursued a policy of wait and watch. Even Ms. Haller now prefers to avoid the topic. “This is a beautiful region,” she said. “It would be a shame to damage its image.”

Switzerland is not the only European country with underwater ordnance. Neutral Sweden similarly stockpiled munitions during the war, and until it stopped in 1969 it had dumped more than 6,500 shells into one of its largest lakes, where they remain. The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union dumped more than 300,000 tons of munitions, including stocks of poisonous mustard gas they had confiscated in Germany, into the Baltic Sea, where the weapons also remain.

But for the orderly Swiss, the munitions in Lake Thun, for all the denial of problems, are a kind of unsightly lump under the national carpet.

There has never been an explosion, and experts agree the lake’s waters are about the cleanest in Switzerland. Yet the munitions have stayed in the public eye around Lake Thun for another reason. About a decade ago, commercial fishermen began to notice a deformation of the reproductive organs of the whitefish, which for generations were their bread-and-butter catch.

Some speculated that chemicals leaching from the dumped munitions were the cause of the undersize organs; others blamed chemicals used for blasting a nearby tunnel through the Alps, which then seeped into the lake.

Christoph Kung, an expert at the government Fisheries Inspectorate, said most recent studies have shown that the lake’s plankton, on which the whitefish feed, are causing the deformities, though studies have not shown what is affecting the plankton. “We did a separate project on munitions,” he added, “but no negative effect could be proven.”

Ask local fishermen about the submerged bombs and they will immediately change the subject and talk of the sewage treatment plants that handle waste from the dozen or so villages and towns that dot the shores of Lake Thun.

“Our haul is only 10 percent of what it was in the late 1970s,” before the treatment plants were built, said Mr. Klopfenstein, 61, who fishes the lake with his wife, Edith. “Before the treatment plants, when the restaurants cleaned up, all the sauces with their flour base went into the lake,” he said. “Fish love that!”

Despite his encounter with the hand grenade, he prefers that the munitions be left undisturbed. “For sure, they’re not a danger,” he said. “They lie on the bottom and each year more sediment covers them.”

But like many hereabouts, he also sees them as a symptom of the growing complication of life on the lake, with its expanding population and spreading habitation, as new homes, some contemporary, most copies of traditional chalets, climb the hills from the shoreline.

“The entire modernization of the Alps is perhaps contributing,” said Markus A. Jegerlehner, a photo shop owner whose family has had a lakeside home for generations, when asked about the lake, its fish and its munitions.

A few miles up the shore from Faulensee, Hans Sieber, 48, agreed with Mr. Klopfenstein. “In the old days, every village butcher gathered the blood and animal parts and poured them into the village stream, which poured into the lake.” Such waste, no longer available, was welcome food for the fish, he said. Once, as many as 40 fishermen worked the lake; today, he is one of 6.

Mr. Sieber, who gave up a career as a chef 30 years ago to take up the family fishing business, does not want the treatment plants shut down any more than he wants the munitions dug up. Far more people live around the lake now than before sewage was treated, he said, and far more chemicals — detergents, cleansers, creams — enrich the village waste now than they did then.

Still, in addition to catching fish, he also breeds them, about eight million fry a year to help nature replenish the supply, and the mystery surrounding the deformed fish troubles him. “The only thing clear is that the whitefish has become the most thoroughly studied species of fish anywhere,” he said. “We’ve even done genetic studies.”

Yet for the moment, the supply of fish is sufficient, and the deformed whitefish can be safely eaten. “You don’t eat the innards,” Mr. Sieber said.
341 2009-08-13 He figures maybe it is.

“There was the concert and everything that came after, and then we went through a long 20-year period of what? Mediocrity? Malaise? I don’t know,” he said. “We just kind of slept for a while, but now it’s coming back to life. There’s really a resurgence here.”

Woodstock is a little like the Middle East, one of those places where everyone has his own view of reality. (And for those unable to actually set foot here, there’s the WoodstockUniverse.com social network.) But the anniversary of the concert, which ended up about 50 miles away at Max Yasgur’s farm in Bethel, is prompting renewed appreciation for the way the town’s history and spirit produced the concert.

After all, long before the concert, hatched and originally planned to be held here, there were Woodstock’s two original attempts to get back to the garden. First was the Byrdcliffe art colony, founded in 1903 as a utopian, anti-industrial community of artists and artisans. Then, beginning in 1905 and peaking in the 1920s, came the Maverick community and festival in which hundreds of free spirits gathered each summer for music, art, theater and drunken orgies in the woods.

Before Woodstock, from 1967 to 1969 there were small-scale, noncommercial musical festivals in the woods called Sound Outs that helped the promoter Michael Lang come up with the idea of the Woodstock Festival. (The main observances of the anniversary are in Bethel, but Woodstock’s version of Woodstock at 40 is a concert on Saturday billed as a celebration of the Sound Outs. Performers will even include Mr. Esposito and the reunited Blues Magoos.)

The concert, of course, made Woodstock famous. And complaining about it at this point would be like complaining about gravity. But a recurring theme in town is that the concert that came to define Woodstock was only the latest and most gargantuan iteration of the town’s creative core — that Woodstock is much more than Woodstock.

“This town has been a spiritual center, a mystical zone that people have been coming to for 100 years,” said David McDonald, who produced “Woodstock Revisited” a film on the town and the concert’s antecedents. “That’s re-emerging. It’s going to stop being ‘Come to Woodstock and get high,’ and become ‘Come to Woodstock and get creative.’ ”

One sign of that is Alchemy of Woodstock, billed as a combination coffeehouse, bookstore, music venue, art gallery and gathering space, and remarkably, one of the only places to hear live music in a town full of famous musicians. And, some say, one positive byproduct of the recession has been to drive down housing costs, keeping the town affordable to artsy types and pulling the plug on much of the boutique Hamptons North dynamic.

But others say, creative or not, Woodstock remains doggedly stuck in time. There’s virtually no construction in the main part of town that wasn’t there in 1969, the Woodstock T-shirt/nostalgia industry is an economic staple and the economy is now dominated by the second-home owners.

“For young people the only career paths are law enforcement or lawn care,” said Peter Cantine, an owner of the Bear Cafe, a popular restaurant.

Still, you don’t get the feeling anyone’s too bummed by it. Even the young people hanging out downtown with skateboards and iPods and rap pouring out of car windows seem to think whatever Woodstock is, it’s just fine.

“It’s all New Age hippies now,” said Nicole Krieger, 20, who sells hemp jewelry in town. “It’s still really cool.”

343 2009-08-13 Q. I’m getting some sort of warning symbol with an icon of a remote control on my television screen when I play shows off my AppleTV. What does this mean?

A. The appearance of the remote icon on the screen means the battery in the little white remote control for the Apple TV needs to be replaced. (Apple also uses these same small plastic remotes for some of its laptops, desktop computers and iPod docks.)

You need to get a new 3-volt CR2032 battery for the remote. These coin-shaped power cells are available for around $5 at RadioShack and other stores that sell batteries for electronic gadgets.

Once you get the fresh battery, get a paper clip and unfold one end of the wire. Stick the end into the small round indentation on the bottom edge of the remote until the battery tray pops out a bit.

Slide the tray out of the remote control and swap out the dying battery for the new one. Push the tray back into the bottom of the remote until it clicks into place.
344 2009-08-13 The government’s emergency loans for small businesses may sound simple, but applying, it turns out, can be quite complex. The proceeds must be used to pay down debt, and applicants must show that the debt was incurred for a “sound business use,” as defined by the Small Business Administration.

Even vendor credit requires a written contract, which can take a month to arrange if you do not have one in place, according to Lori Chillingworth, a senior vice president of Zions Bank of Salt Lake City (and the first lender to complete a loan through the new program, America’s Recovery Capital). The easiest debts to document, she said, are mortgages and working capital.

To make the process go smoothly, applicants should have paperwork ready before going to the bank. And they shouldn’t be afraid to inundate their bankers. “As much documentation as borrowers can give us would be great,” said Tom Burke of Wells Fargo. Here is the minimum needed to get started:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The business must supply annual financial statements for the last three years (or since inception if the business is less than three years old), as well as an interim statement if the latest annual is more than 90 days old. Besides showing that your business is viable, the financials in most cases should confirm that the company faces an immediate financial hardship. Incidentally, the bank must verify these figures with the Internal Revenue Service. (Many banks will also examine tax returns for the same period.)

CASH-FLOW PROJECTIONS These must be quarterly (or sometimes monthly) and based on reasonable assumptions. Some banks will help borrowers work these out, but it is a useful exercise for the business owner, Mr. Burke said: “It really makes them do their homework and figure out if they’re going to be around to pay this loan back. You want them to really think that through.”

EVIDENCE OF A LEGITIMATE DEBT For most debts in the business’s name, you will have to provide the loan contract or note. (Some banks will also ask to see a recent coupon or activity statement.) For home equity loans and credit cards — that is, for debts that are not wholly or explicitly business-related — you will need to provide a recent monthly statement, as well as invoices and receipts for any particular charges you hope to pay down with the federal loan.

If you do apply for the loan, please tell us how it goes here.
345 2009-08-13 Small-business owners hoping for some assistance of the sort given to the nation’s biggest banks applauded when the Small Business Administration unveiled a lending program in May.

Washington officials and some lenders predicted that the program, providing emergency bridge loans as part of the economic stimulus package, would save jobs and provide a lifeline for vulnerable businesses. Many in the banking industry expected it to be fully subscribed in months.

But the program is off to a slow start, and many banks, including some of the largest, appear reluctant to take part.

With $255 million, the program is prepared to make about 10,000 loans of up to $35,000 each. As of Monday, the agency reported that only 1,127 loans, totaling $36.8 million, had been extended.

While the agency maintains that the program is on track, some in the banking industry say the banks are moving slowly because they have little incentive. “There’s not a lot of profit motive in a $35,000 loan stretched over six years,” said Paul Merski, chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association.

Bob Seiwert, of the Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking at the American Bankers Association, says “stringent underwriting standards” will require as much work as larger loans, making these even less economical.

Alex Cooper, a counselor at the Pima Community College Small Business Development Center in Tucson, says he has helped nearly 30 clients apply for the loans. None has received one.

“It’s a disappointment,” said Mr. Cooper. “I thought the banks would be more interested in the community and try to help small businesses.”

Under the program, known as America’s Recovery Capital, a business owner applies to a bank for a loan and, if approved, can use the proceeds to retire existing debt. The borrower pays no interest on the new loan.

Instead, the Small Business Administration pays the bank two percentage points over the prime rate. After a one-year deferral, the borrower repays the loan over five years. The agency will repay the lender in case of default.

At the current rate, the program could have loans available through September 2010, when it is set to expire. “We like the fact, actually, that they will be spread out over time,” said Karen G. Mills, head of the Small Business Administration. “We have no doubt that we will make 10,000 loans.”

Not surprisingly, small-business owners are less pleased with the slow pace. Among the frustrated applicants is Mark Rusin, a client of Mr. Cooper’s whose restaurant business has fallen precipitously in the last year.

Mr. Rusin bought a franchise location of Uno Chicago Grill north of Tucson in April 2007 for $3.2 million. He dropped the franchise agreement because of fees and restyled the restaurant as the Loop Taste of Chicago.

Then came the recession. As the snowbirds left for points north this spring, sales tumbled. June revenue was $72,000, down 28 percent from a year earlier. “I’m bleeding out to the tune of 10 grand a month right now,” Mr. Rusin said. One of the new loans, he said, would see him through the next couple of months.

Part of the problem for borrowers like Mr. Rusin may be that Congress restricted loan eligibility to companies that are simultaneously struggling yet viable. That means the business must face an “immediate financial hardship,” meaning a 20 percent reduction in a critical operating number, such as revenue.

But the company, which has to have been in business at least two years, also has to have shown positive cash flow, if not an actual profit, in one of the last two years. It also must do a two-year cash-flow projection to show it can repay all its obligations.

The effort required to verify all of this probably explains why those banks that are participating in the program are lending primarily to existing clients. “From a financial perspective, it really is a loan that makes sense for an existing customer,” Mr. Merski said. “You’re not going to have to put out a lot of resources to do a very costly underwriting. You know the business.”

Mr. Rusin was fortunate in that the lender holding a first position on his commercial mortgage, M & I Bank of Milwaukee, is participating in the program. He hoped to use the loan to pay his vendors. But soon after he submitted his application, Mr. Rusin said, the bank told him he could use the loan only to pay down the earlier debt owed to the bank.
346 2009-08-13 In a career marked by documentaries that have won Oscars (“Harlan County U.S.A.,” “American Dream”) or deserved to (“Wild Man Blues,” “Shut Up & Sing”) Barbara Kopple has pursued a lesser-known sideline: Woodstock films. “Woodstock ’94” and “My Generation” covered the concerts that marked the 25th and 30th anniversaries of the world’s most famous rock festival. Now, for the 40th, Ms. Kopple has gone back upstate to complete a trilogy of sorts with “Woodstock: Now & Then,” a history of the original event that will be shown Friday night on VH1.

How this intelligent, straightforward film ended up on the network of “Megan Wants a Millionaire” and “Daisy of Love” is a mystery, but we should just be grateful to VH1 for broadcasting it. (It will also be shown Monday night on the History Channel.)

Anyone making a movie about Woodstock faces the challenge of “Woodstock,” the momentous 1970 documentary that defined the festival for all who weren’t there, locking in how we see and think about it and defining the musical high points. Ms. Kopple doesn’t mount any arguments against the earlier film; instead she co-opts it, not only making liberal use of its images but also giving its director, Michael Wadleigh, and one of its editors, Thelma Schoonmaker, prominent voices in her retelling. “Now & Then” is an unabashed celebration of Woodstock and of the peace-love spirit that Mr. Wadleigh exalted 40 years ago, and it was made by a filmmaker who wasn’t there but could have, should have been: Ms. Kopple, who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., was 23 in August 1969.

In one way her film is probably truer to the actual experience of the average Woodstock attendee than Mr. Wadleigh’s was. She focuses less on the music, which for some portion of the half-million people in attendance was merely a rumor.

She spends time on the genesis of the festival and the chaotic preparations, which, after a change in location, meant the stage and the light and sound towers were still under construction the night before the crowds started arriving. (Michael Lang, a co-producer of the festival and its driving force, is an executive producer of the film.)

She focuses on the logistics of food and medical care, and the role of the Hog Farm commune in providing both; Wavy Gravy and his wife, Jahanara Romney, provide first-hand accounts. Ms. Kopple also delves into the financial morass the festival left in its wake: about 80 lawsuits and a million-dollar deficit that the young producers settled by selling their interest in the film, a concession that was eventually worth many millions.
347 2009-08-13 “Special Ops Mission,” a new series beginning Thursday night on the Military Channel, sits on the spectrum of living-room heroics somewhere between “24” and a first-person-shooter video game. The premise is that actual special operators — former Army Rangers, members of the Navy Seals, Force Recon Marines — play out situations like terrorist-camp infiltrations or pirate takedowns as authentically as possible. Everything is real, we’re led to believe, except the bullets. Oh, and the presence of the camera crews.

The press notes refer to “simulated” and “dramatic” scenarios; the show itself, on the other hand, begins with an on-screen declaration, “This is an unscripted war game.” In the pilot episode the degree to which the action — the rescue of hostages from a large, empty, warrenlike building — has been choreographed (as opposed to “scripted,” an entirely different thing) is never addressed.

Perhaps younger viewers no longer care about, or even register, the extent to which what they’re watching has been prompted and staged for the camera. I’ve learned not to care with a whole range of programs, from “The Real World” to the real housewives. But when I’m watching men playing what purports to be an elaborate game of hide and seek with automatic weapons, that coyness about methods — the lie we’ve all agreed to participate in so that reality television can exist — bugs me more than usual and saps much of the interest from the show in question.

And “Special Ops Mission” doesn’t have a surplus to begin with. The star of the show is Wil Willis, an Army Ranger and Air Force pararescueman (we’re told), who will take on each week’s impossible mission with the help of his “commander,” identified as Master Sgt. Thomas Minder (as in hinder), who monitors Mr. Willis’s progress by video and gives him radio updates. Sergeant Minder appears to be the more charismatic of the two, and you begin to wish that he wasn’t stuck in the “remote command center.”

In fairness to Mr. Willis, he’s handicapped by his combat gear, which includes goggles and a helmet, and he has to spend nearly the entire hour whispering. Still, we spend much of the show focused on him — a camera mounted on his gun gives us frequent close-ups of his face — and his panting, nervous, downbeat affect quickly becomes off-putting. His opponents in the episode, four men with backgrounds in the Army, Navy and Marines, get to dress in the black sweaters that designate action villains, and their faces are uncovered. As a result they end up being more sympathetic than Mr. Willis, our hero.

The operation itself is basically a big game of paintball: the guns are loaded with Simunition, realistic-looking cartridges that are, well, paintballs designed to work in M4’s and M16’s. Helpful graphics show us where the players are at different moments, and a digital clock ticks away. By the time Mr. Willis concludes his first mission, six hours have passed; on “24” Kiefer Sutherland would be a quarter of the way toward saving the world from nuclear annihilation.
348 2009-08-13 WASHINGTON  Almost exactly two years after it embarked on what was the biggest financial rescue in American history, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the recession is ending and that it would take a step back toward normal policy.

Though the central bank stopped well short of declaring victory, policy makers issued their most upbeat assessment in more than a year by saying that the downturn appears to have hit bottom and that consumer spending, financial markets and inventory-building by corporations all continued to stabilize.

“Economic activity is leveling out,” the Fed’s policy-making committee said Wednesday after a two-day meeting, adding that inflation would remain “subdued for some time.”

The central bank cautioned that the recovery would be slow and that unemployment was likely to remain high for the next year. It reiterated that it would keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at virtually zero for an extended period.

But it also announced that it would wrap up its program to buy $300 billion worth of Treasury bonds by the end of October. The program was one of several tools invoked to drive down long-term interest rates and indirectly reduce the cost of home mortgages and corporate borrowing.

The move signaled that policy makers were confident enough to remove one of their emergency props for the financial markets.

“In a way, it’s more of a thumbs-up than if they had said they were continuing the Treasury-buying,” said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs. “They’re saying that things are going according to plan, and that the policy is O.K.”

Stock prices, which were already up from Tuesday, ticked up again after the Fed announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 120.16 points, or 1.30 percent, at 9,361.61.

Fed officials made it clear they were still more worried about unemployment than a resurgence of inflation. As they have said for months, they will use “all available tools” to support the economy and will keep the benchmark federal funds rate at “exceptionally low levels” for the foreseeable future. Many analysts predict that the Fed will not raise the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate at which banks lend reserves to each other, until late next year.

The central bank is not yet throttling back its biggest emergency credit programs. The Fed is barely halfway through its plan to buy $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, a program that directly affects home mortgage rates and has had a much more noticeable effect than the Treasury bond program.

Analysts said the Federal Reserve had entered a wait-and-see period, continuing to supply the economy with cheap money but not expanding or extending the emergency programs beyond what policy makers have already announced.

The government’s preliminary estimates show that the economy’s downturn slowed markedly in recent months, shrinking only 1 percent in the second quarter compared with 6.4 percent in the first. The rate of job losses has slowed sharply as well, though the nation still lost 247,000 jobs in July.

The most recent forecasts by Fed policy makers say that the economy will begin an unusually slow recovery in the second half of this year and pick up speed only gradually in 2010. Even if all goes according to plan, the Fed envisions that unemployment will climb from its already high level of 9.4 percent and average as much as 9.8 percent through the end of 2010.

“The balance of risks is still tilted toward weakness in growth and employment, and not toward higher inflation,” said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a speech on July 29. Mr. Dudley said it was “premature to talk about ‘when’ we are going to exit from this period of unusual policy accommodation.”

Rising productivity rates in the United States are giving the Fed more maneuvering room to keep borrowing costs low without aggravating inflation. The productivity of workers, the amount produced per hour of work, shot up at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the second quarter and has been climbing throughout the recession.

That is unusual for an economic downturn, but it means that wages have more room to climb before employers start to raise prices for their goods and services.

The Fed’s decision to end its program of buying Treasury bonds appears to have reflected both practical and philosophical concerns among some policy makers.

According to minutes of the Fed’s previous policy meeting in June, some policy makers worried that the central bank’s heavy purchases of new Treasury debt would be seen by investors as simply financing the federal government’s huge deficits. That, they feared, would erode the Fed’s credibility and heighten inflation expectations.

“Some of those who are less disposed to additional Treasury purchases worry about the perception in the markets that they are motivated by a desire to help the Treasury finance a mountain of debt,” wrote Laurence H. Meyer, chief economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, and a former Fed governor, in a note to clients last week.

By contrast, Mr. Meyer said, most policy makers seem to agree that the mortgage-security program strikes at the heart of the economy’s biggest problem  the housing market.

On a practical level, analysts said, the Treasury-buying program never packed as much punch in the markets.

At $300 billion, the Treasury purchases are only one-quarter as big as the mortgage program, and they have equaled only about one-third of the new issuance of Treasury securities, according to Ira Jersey, an interest-rate analyst at Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. By contrast, the Fed purchases of government-guaranteed mortgage securities equaled more than 100 percent of new issuance in that market.

Though mortgage rates have edged up in recent weeks, along with other long-term interest rates, the spread between mortgage rates and risk-free Treasury rates has narrowed by almost half since last November.

“The program to buy Treasuries wasn’t as effective as some of the other programs, like the mortgage-security program, so ending it made sense,” Mr. Jersey said.
349 2009-08-13 BEIJING — A prominent Chinese artist and frequent critic of the Communist Party said he was hit by police officers and put under detention in his hotel room in western China on Wednesday when he tried to go testify at the trial of a civil rights advocate.

The artist, Ai Weiwei, best known for helping to design the Bird’s Nest Olympic Stadium in Beijing, said dozens of police officers barged into his hotel room early Wednesday and the rooms of others who had traveled to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to testify on behalf of Tan Zuoren, the rights advocate.

The opening session of Mr. Tan’s trial began Wednesday morning and ended hours later without a verdict. The courtroom was closed to the public. Mr. Tan, a well-known writer, has been charged with subversion. He is believed to be on trial because of his role in pushing for an official investigation into widespread school collapses during the Sichuan earthquake last year, and for trying to organize a group event in June to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the massacre of civilians by government forces during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

Earlier this month, another rights advocate, Huang Qi, went on trial on a charge of possessing state secrets. Like Mr. Tan, he pushed for the government to investigate the school collapses.

During the earthquake last year, thousands of students were killed when school buildings in Sichuan and other provinces crumbled, even as surrounding buildings remained standing. Grieving parents said shoddy construction and corruption were responsible, and demanded that officials investigate. Local governments went to great efforts to silence the parents, ordering the police to detain them, or handing out cash payments in exchange for the parents’ dropping their complaints.

370 2009-08-14 “My mind-set was really good,” she said. “I feel really good after this match.”

For the Williams sisters, it was the first time since May at Madrid that neither of them reached a quarterfinal. Serena lost in the first round of that tournament, Venus in the second round.

Third-seeded Venus made some of her worst shots at the biggest moments Thursday. She hit a couple of forehands long during the first-set tiebreaker, and ended the match by sending a forehand well beyond the baseline.

Second-seeded Serena was determined not to make it an 0-2 day for the Williams family.

“We don’t lose too much in the same day, so usually I’m so pumped,” Serena said. “And I was pumped today. I just couldn’t get it together.”

COULD IT COME DOWN TO TOP 8? The third round of the Rogers Cup and men’s tennis history unfolded simultaneously Thursday in Montreal.

The ATP World Tour started ranking players in 1973, and over 36 years and thousands of tournaments, the top eight ranked players in the world had never advanced to the quarterfinals of the same championship. The top eight seeds had done so, but never the top eight players.

These results served to highlight the depth at the top of the men’s game, where the bulk of attention is typically focused on Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Even a player like Andy Roddick, who called this year one of his most consistent, sits at No. 5.

“Certainly the top six have been putting up results pretty much very, very consistently this year,” Roddick said. “There’s a precedent being set by the top guys right now.”

By midafternoon, Roddick said the historic implications of this tournament were spreading through the locker room. Novak Djokovic (4) and Juan Martín del Potro (6) had won in the morning, while Nadal (2) and Nikolay Davydenko (8) added victories in the afternoon.

They were joined by a pair of Andys, third-ranked Murray and fifth-ranked Roddick, which set the stage for a dramatic evening at Stade Uniprix.

Roddick played the most compelling of the third-round matches, needing a third set tie breaker to finish off 10th-ranked Fernando Verdasco, a streaky player who Roddick said afterward had been “swinging out of his shoes.”

The most crushing defeat of Roddick’s career had come against Federer in Wimbledon final. The miserable feeling, the despair from playing so well and losing in five epic sets, had stuck with Roddick.

Larry Stefanki, Roddick’s coach, said Roddick had long had trouble letting go of disappointments. So when Roddick fell behind, 2-0, in the final tie breaker and tossed his racket over his shoulder in frustration, Stefanki grew worried.

Roddick rallied to win the tie breaker, 7-5, advancing to the quarterfinals this year for the 11th time in 12 tournaments.

Nadal, meanwhile, won his first full-length singles match since the third round of the French Open. His first match here ended when his opponent retired after seven games.

Nadal lost at Roland Garros on May 31, then spent 10 weeks testing and rehabilitating two knees pained by tendinitis. On Sunday, Nadal listed his goals for the Rogers Cup, which he entered as the defending champion. He wanted to improve his fitness, test his knees and build toward a peak performance at the United States Open.

After his victory over Philipp Petzschner, Nadal said his knees felt fine.

“I am not the favorite for the match tomorrow,” he added.

Federer has won 21 consecutive singles matches. Djokovic has more singles victories (49) this year than anyone on tour. Roddick nearly pulled off the Wimbledon upset. GREG BISHOP
371 2009-08-14 Mr. Freedman predicted that the level of dissatisfaction would increase. “Judges are likely to have less and less patience for being hogtied by legalistic mumbo-jumbo,” he said, “which prevents them from reaching fair results.”

The law that generates much of the judges’ ire is the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since its passage, the act has been cited in a half-dozen to two dozen dissents a year, often in language forceful enough to rival Judge Fletcher’s. The law, championed by legislators who believed prisoners were abusing the federal appeals process, restricts federal court review of state court decisions in death penalty cases and puts strong limits on the ability of condemned prisoners to file habeas corpus petitions to get their cases reconsidered.

In April, Judge Rosemary Barkett of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, complained of the law’s “thicket of procedural brambles.” Dissenting from a decision by her colleagues, Judge Barkett noted that seven of the nine witnesses in the murder trial of Troy Davis, a death row inmate in Georgia, had recanted their testimony. To execute Mr. Davis without fully considering that evidence would be “unconscionable and unconstitutional,” wrote Judge Barkett, who has voted in more than 200 other cases to uphold the death penalty.

Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit, a critic of capital punishment, took on the constitutionality of the 1996 death penalty act itself in a dissent in the case of Andrew C. Crater, who had been convicted of taking part in a robbery and shooting spree that killed a Sacramento musician, James Pantages. Judge Reinhardt, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, wrote in 2007 that the act made “a mockery of the careful boundaries between Congress and the courts that our Constitution’s framers believed so essential to the prevention of tyranny.”

The dissents rarely have any practical effect in changing the outcome of the cases they address. But Howard J. Bashman, an appellate lawyer in Philadelphia, said such dissents were often directed toward audiences to come: the next appeals court, lawmakers and academics.

“You have to think that these judges do have some valid reason for putting all this effort into the exercise than just feeling better about it after they’re done,” Mr. Bashman said.

Judge Barkett, whom President Bill Clinton appointed, declined to discuss individual cases but agreed that a dissent tried to persuade many audiences — the first, in her case, being the other judges of her court, who circulate dissents among themselves as they are coming to a decision.

Judge Barkett said she did not see her opinions as “emotive,” adding that dissents were about policy, not feelings. But the feeling that motivates her to write them, she said, is “mostly frustration that I cannot make people see what I see.”

Judge Fletcher’s frustration was on display in the case of Mr. Cooper, who he concluded was “probably innocent” of the 1983 murders of Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica and an 11-year-old houseguest, Christopher Hughes, who were hacked to death in the Ryens’ home.

Judge Fletcher argued that the evidence had been tainted by bumbling and misconduct and suggested that blood linking Mr. Cooper to the crime had been planted by overzealous investigators. And while the Ninth Circuit in 2004 ordered new DNA tests, Judge Fletcher wrote that the lower court had set conditions rendering the results useless. “There is no way to say this politely,” he wrote. “The district court failed to provide Cooper a fair hearing and flouted our direction to perform the two tests.”

Judge Fletcher, who declined to be interviewed, was appointed by Mr. Clinton.

Jesse H. Choper, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the judge was hardly a fierce opponent of capital punishment. “I don’t see him as someone who is unexceptionally opposed,” Mr. Choper said.

In the Cooper case, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, was among 11 of the circuit’s 27 judges who joined dissents.

Elisabeth A. Semel, director of the Death Penalty Clinic at Berkeley, which trains lawyers to defend people facing the death penalty, said many jurists had been shaken by the rise of exonerations due to DNA evidence. “I think it’s been shattering to judges who had a fair amount of confidence in the system,” she said.

The next step in the Cooper case is a long-shot appeal to the Supreme Court, which Mr. Cooper’s lead lawyer, Norman C. Hile, said was likely to be filed this year.

Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group in Sacramento that favors the death penalty, said substantial claims of innocence in such appeals remained rare.

In Mr. Cooper’s case, Mr. Scheidegger said, the defendant has been given ample opportunity to exonerate himself. “It is high time to bring this case to a close,” Mr. Scheidegger said.

Judge Fletcher argued otherwise. “If he is innocent, the real killers have escaped,” he wrote. “They may kill again. They may already have done so.

“We owe it to the victims of this horrible crime, to Kevin Cooper, and to ourselves, to get this one right.”
372 2009-08-14 China’s leaders, he said, “are just beginning to learn how to handle that.”

Consider the following: Since late May, Beijing’s Industry and Information Technology Ministry had more or less insisted that so-called anti-pornography software, called Green Dam-Youth Escort, would eventually be packaged with every newly purchased computer.

On Thursday, the ministry backed down, calling the requirement a “misunderstanding” spawned by badly written rules. Officials offered no other explanation, but the retreat followed weeks of protests by outsiders — from foreign computer makers to foreign governments to foreign corporate branch offices — that said the software stifled free speech, compromised corporate security and threatened computers’ stability.

Computers are not the only example.

This week, the World Trade Organization told Beijing that it could no longer force providers of American books, and films to distribute their goods through a local partner. Foreign companies saw that rule as an impediment to reaching a broad Chinese audience with their products. The Chinese market is flooded with pirated CDs and DVDs whose contents’ creators receive no money.

The Chinese legally may appeal the decision, but the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, indicated in a speech that simply ignoring it was not an option. China worked for years to join the global trading system and is bound, as much as other nations are, by its rules.

“China will never seek to advance its interests at the expense of others,” Mr. Yang said, according to Reuters.

Similarly, Chinese prosecutors appeared this week to retreat from earlier statements that they would prosecute employees of Rio Tinto as spies for stealing state secrets.

While the espionage allegations were not spelled out, they were apparently related to delicate commercial negotiations over the price of China’s imports of iron ore for its steel mills.

Rio Tinto executives have strongly denied the accusations, and both the and said China’s actions could have both business and diplomatic repercussions.

While the Rio Tinto employees still face lesser charges of bribery and theft of trade secrets, the espionage threats stirred broad unease among foreign companies operating in China, which feared that they could face persecution and closed-door trials for engaging in what much of the world would regard as bare-knuckle business tactics.

Yet whether such instances represent trends or exceptions — or neither — remains a matter of some debate.

Increasingly, many experts say, Chinese officials appear to be aware that their actions have far broader ramifications than they might have had even a few years ago.

“Fifteen years ago, the mantra in China was, ‘We’re the victims of a system that’s stacked against us,’ ” said James V. Feinerman, an expert on Chinese law and policy at in .

China’s entry into the world trading system, he said, is slowly helping to change the nation’s view of itself from that of an outsider to an insider with a stake in the global system’s success.

Other experts note, however, that what outsiders see as carefully calculated policy changes may in fact be nothing of the sort.

The government’s decision to install censorship software on computers — and its subsequent reversal — is but one example, they say; the original proposal was probably pushed by a government clique that found itself outflanked once Internet users and foreign corporations began objecting to the plan.

“Is China susceptible to international pressure? Of course it is,” said Charles Freeman, a leading China scholar at the in Washington.

“China does have international interests, and they are impacted by what it does domestically,” he said. “There’s a constant battle between agencies over how much political capital to expend on international issues against domestic interests.”

In any case, few experts are willing to stake their reputations on a prediction that Beijing’s recent softening of some positions signifies a strong trend.

To the contrary, Mr. Feinerman said, China had undergone “a real pushback” in the last five years on some fronts, reasserting political dogma in some areas where commercial norms and the rule of law had begun to have more sway.

And Jonathan Hecht, an expert on Chinese law at ’s China Law Center, said that developments in China should be viewed against a history of great leaps forward on such matters, followed by equally great retreats.

“I’ve given up predicting long-term trends,” he said.
373 2009-08-14 The scientists were searching the samples for variations in several genes thought to be related to the sleep cycle. In what amounts to finding a needle in a haystack, they spotted two DNA samples with abnormal copies of a gene called DEC2, which is known to affect circadian rhythms. They then worked back to find out who provided the samples and found a mother and daughter who were naturally short sleepers. The women routinely function on about 6 hours of sleep a night; the average person needs 8 to 8.5 hours of sleep.

When scientists bred mice with the same mutation, the animals slept less and recovered quicker from periods of sleep deprivation compared with regular mice.

“We know sleep is necessary for life, but we know so little about sleep,” says Ying-Hui Fu, study co-author and professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. “As we understand the sleep mechanism more and more and all the pathways, we’ll be able to understand more about what causes sleep problems.”

What distinguishes the two women in the study and other naturally short sleepers is that they go to bed at a normal time and wake up early without an alarm. The two women, one in her 70s and the other in her 40s, go to bed around 10 or 10:30 at night and wake up alert and energized around 4 or 4:30 in the morning, Dr. Fu said.

“When they wake up in morning, they feel they have slept enough,” Dr. Fu said. “They want to get up and do things. They arrange all their major tasks in their morning.”

Dr. Fu said that while many people might sleep only six or fewer hours a night, most were not naturally short sleepers. For instance, they use stimulants and alarm clocks to maintain a shortened sleep schedule.

“Many people get only six hours of sleep a night, but we drink coffee and tea to make ourselves stay up,” she said. “That’s a very different thing. Our body needs 8 to 8.5 hours.”

The genetic mutation appears to be rare. Out of 70 families with known sleep problems studied at the university, only one family carried the mutation. Dr. Fu said fewer than 5 percent of people appeared to be naturally short sleepers.

The real benefit of the research will come if and when the mutation is identified in other individuals. That could lead to new discoveries about sleep timing and duration, and possibly new treatments for sleep disorders.

Dr. Fu said her “fantasy” was that the finding might eventually lead to a safe treatment for people who wanted or needed more awake hours and were looking for a way to get by on less sleep without harming their health.
374 2009-08-14 In our updated National Security Strategy, published in June, we set out how climate change will act as a threat multiplier in years to come, worsening problems like poverty, mass migration and regional instability around the world.

The environmental and economic arguments for all countries to reduce their emissions are relatively well known; the security implications are becoming more apparent and are increasingly being considered by countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and our partners around the world.

At the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen in December, our governments have the opportunity through an ambitious global agreement to prevent dangerous climate change from happening. National security is not the only motivation for us to reduce global emissions, but it is certainly a compelling one.

As our prime minister, Gordon Brown, said in June, “Not just our well-being, but the security of our planet and our humanity is at stake.”

I appreciate The New York Times’s addressing the national security impacts of global warming. As your article notes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will help lessen these threats.

But as vital as that is, it is not enough. We must also take strong and effective action now to lessen the effect of climate change on already fragile natural systems and on the people who depend on those natural systems for food, water, shelter and their very survival.

As a retired brigadier general who served for 32 years in the Army before joining the Nature Conservancy, I hope our elected officials will pay heed to our military leaders. They understand that taking action now to address the conditions that lead to conflict is far better and far cheaper in every sense of the word than letting those threats emerge unaddressed.

The security threat forced by global climate change is certainly a worrisome issue. But if the root cause of climate change is not addressed, all attempts to ameliorate this threat will fail. That underlying cause is the rampant growth of the human population.

The strain we place on our planet’s natural resources is independent of increasing temperatures and rising sea levels. They will simply make the impending crisis happen earlier and with greater force.

In just the last 40 years, we have added 3 billion people to the planet, going from a population of 3.7 billion to 6.7 billion. It is estimated that at least 9 billion humans will be searching for food, clean water and energy in another 40 years.

The Earth’s great gift of oil may be completely gone. Imagine a world with no oil and 9 billion people, with more on the way.

It is not just our carbon footprint we need to reduce; it is our human footprint.

The writer is an astronomer.

It’s nice to know that the national security establishment of which I was a part has belatedly awoken to climate change and its impending impact on the planet.

National security officials are usually very pragmatic, and this would (and should) have happened years ago but for an artificial coma induced by the Bush administration.

That said, the scurrying around now as to “how to deal with this” worries me as all too typical of the imperial overstretch to which the United States is prone.

We are not going to surmount or solve climate change. It’s too late for that. We along with the rest of the planet are going to suffer it, and the sooner that mind-set is absorbed in Washington — and we adopt a bit of modesty in accepting disasters and some chaos abroad without intervening — the better for our military, our society and the American taxpayer.

Your article about climate change was very timely given the recent havoc in the Pacific because of stronger hurricanes, typhoons and so forth. And there have been so many “natural” disasters in the last few years that it is becoming apparent to me that it is not natural.

People fighting to stay alive through these events surely won’t recognize borders. Our national security as well as our health systems and our economy could all fall apart.

While a bill to curb global warming has already passed the House, it sets up a complex system that could take time to put into effect. Representative John B. Larson and Representative Bob Inglis both have carbon tax bills that would be simple to enforce and could, if passed, be acted on right away.

If someone were firing a missile at us, we would act immediately to protect ourselves. We need to treat this national security threat with the same urgency.
375 2009-08-14 Even tiny markets are a draw, like the one in Hillsdale in Columbia County. There are fewer than a dozen stands, and it is only open every other weekend between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Yul and Arthur Kaseman, who have a weekend home nearby, go as often as they can. Ms. Kaseman, 34, a hedge-fund client-services specialist in Manhattan, said she likes to understand the source of the food she buys. Hillsdale’s intimate size means that she can connect easily with local growers and learn about their practices. “When I get the additional information I’m seeking from a farmer who is my neighbor — not just a commercial seller — it makes the food I buy that much more special,” she said.

Talea and Doug Fincke, both 50, agree. “Small farming is our passion, and we think small is big,” Ms. Fincke said. For 23 years they have been growing fruit — and recently some vegetables — on 40 acres at the 18th-century Montgomery Place estate in Annandale-on-Hudson, owned by the nonprofit preservation group Historic Hudson Valley. The couple run the Montgomery Place Orchards Farm Stand nearby, a showcase for their produce and homemade jams as well as local products like Awesome Farm’s pasture-raised whole chickens and Nettle Meadow’s herb-infused fromage blanc.

“We’re seasonal purists,” Ms. Fincke said, pushing red raspberries through a sieve at her jam-making table on a recent Sunday afternoon. The Finckes’ just-picked black raspberries, white peaches, antique apples and heirloom tomatoes are a magnet for second-home owners, nearby Bard College faculty members and students, and famous visitors, like the actress Uma Thurman and the singer Natalie Merchant.

For Nancy Ploeger, who owns a weekend home in Claverack, in Columbia County, the pleasure of eating food “just plucked out of the dirt or off a tree” is compounded by her appreciation for how hard farmers like Ruth and Vic Ambrose work. The Ambroses, both in their 80s, remain hands-on at their Scarecrow Farm in Hollowville, growing produce and raising sheep for wool and free-range hens for what Ms. Ploeger, 59, described as “the best tasting eggs, bar none.” Ms. Ambrose also jars honey, pickles vegetables, bakes cookies and runs their crafts shop.

As president of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Ploeger understands the struggles of small businesses. As much as she can, she said, she buys directly from the Ambroses and the Hudson Farmers’ Market, where she patronizes different stands, including Scarecrow Farm’s, every Saturday.

For Elizabeth Mayhew, a decorating expert and contributor to NBC’s “Today” program, buying local is more important than buying organic all the time, which can be expensive, she said. On Saturday mornings Ms. Mayhew, 40, her daughter, Madeleine, 12, and son, Charlie, 9, typically make the rounds at the small but lively market in Millbrook, where they have a second home. Saying that “grocery stores are where vegetables go to die,” she added that she valued Sol Flower Farm produce, Herondale Farm grass-fed beef and pasture-raised pork, and Millbrook Farmhouse cheeses. “I’ve come to rely on finding — and supporting — certain products there that my family loves,” she said.

Through farmers’ markets some longtime growers have developed a prolific business. “We make 75 to 80 percent of our sales at farmers’ markets,” said Ken Migliorelli, a Tivoli grower who sells to 40 markets a week throughout the New York metropolitan area as well as the Hudson Valley. Mr. Migliorelli and his father, Rocco, were among the original vendors at the Union Square green market in 1982 — a move that saved the family’s farm from bankruptcy. “Our upstate operations are now a bigger part of our business,” Mr. Migliorelli said. Because he grows 150 varieties of fruits and vegetables, Migliorelli Farm produce is frequently sought for new farmers’ markets throughout the Hudson Valley.

Of course the quality of the produce is paramount. “It’s easier to support a community institution when it’s good,” said Eric Wallach, 62, an Upper East Side lawyer who views the Sunday farmers’ market in Rhinebeck, where he and his wife Miriam, 60, weekend, as a great asset. Whether they buy from the bread stand, fruit grower or newly installed fishmonger, “the quality of the food is very high,” Ms. Wallach said. The couple, who frequently shop open-air markets in Provence, France, give their local market high marks. “On a much smaller scale, Rhinebeck holds its own,” Ms. Wallach said.

377 2009-08-15 The division that runs the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty is in better financial shape than Wall Street analysts originally thought, despite high payrolls, legal costs and other expenses.

MSG Sports, a division of Madison Square Garden Inc., lost $32 million in the first half of this year, 64 percent more than in the same period in 2008, according to a regulatory filing last week by Cablevision, which owns the teams.

But MSG, which Cablevision plans to spin off before the end of the year, is expected to have no debt when it becomes a stand-alone company. It will also generate more than $100 million in profits before interest payments, taxes and other deductions. And MSG will receive a one-time payment of $190 million from Cablevision next year.

In addition to its sports division, MSG includes a media group that runs a regional sports network and an entertainment group that operates sites including Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theater, as well as the Christmas Spectacular show.

Financial analysts did not have a complete picture of MSG’s finances while it was a division of Cablevision. The figures released last week provided a better picture of MSG’s ability to generate revenue.
378 2009-08-15 Re “Farewell to Poverty, With Jitters” (Week in Review, Aug. 9):

Akash Kapur’s essay hit a responsive nerve. After an almost 50-year career — as a Peace Corps volunteer, international development professional and global environmental advocate — I share a similar sense of ambiguity about the meaning of progress.

I am no longer comfortable with the formulas put forward by economists, political scientists and politicians, anthropologists, ecologists, geographers and sociologists. There is no right answer — no obvious path. Rather, there is only a cascading set of different causes and different effects leading to different results in different situations in different places for different people.

Perhaps the best we can hope for are systems of human invention that promote a fair sense of equity and justice and offer a reasonable hope for sustaining humankind and the natural environment that supports it.

379 2009-08-15 A Maltese-flagged freighter with a Russian crew that vanished last month in the Atlantic may have been found Friday near Cape Verde, off the coast of West Africa, French officials said. The ship, the Arctic Sea, carrying timber and 15 Russian sailors, disappeared after passing through the English Channel on July 28.

A French Defense Ministry spokesman, Capt. Jerome Baroe, said the Cape Verde Coast Guard had found the ship in international waters about 520 miles north of Cape Verde. Russia’s ambassador to Cape Verde, Alexander Karpushin, did not confirm that the ship had been found, but said that Russian naval ships had been ordered to pursue the ship spotted by the coast guard.
380 2009-08-15 Frontier Airlines could emerge from bankruptcy as early as next month, its chief executive said on Friday.

Republic Airways Holdings won a bankruptcy court auction on Thursday for Frontier, with a bid of nearly $109 million that had been raised to offer creditors other than Republic about 18 cents on the dollar. The executive, Sean Menke, said Friday that the Southwest Airlines Company withdrew its bid of more than $170 million after it became clear that pilot unions for both airlines would not be able to agree on how their ranks would be integrated. Mr. Menke said Frontier could emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as early as Sept. 17.
381 2009-08-15 The management at the Beatrice Inn would not comment, but one of the owners, Paul Sevigny, plans to open a new club and restaurant in SoHo, away from residential areas, said people involved in the discussions. In the meantime, “Free the Beatrice” T-shirts are being distributed at parties, and people who have attended meetings on the club’s future say there are still plans to make the necessary amendments and reopen on 12th Street.

“I’m going to miss it,” said Michael Herman, 31, a regular patron who was outside the bar on the night that inspectors turned the lights up and the music off. “You couldn’t buy your way in, so it was kind of the last place that creative people could get together.”

Noise is hardly a new problem in a city where thousands of people — lovers of partying and lovers of peace and quiet alike — are packed into every square mile. But complaints have spiked in recent years, especially as the real estate boom has brought “an inward migration of older, wealthier people to the cities, especially to interesting cultural centers,” said Ken Patton, the head of the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate. “Manhattan is the mother of those,” he added.

Leonard Steinberg, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, a real estate company, said some newcomers fell in love with their apartments or neighborhoods “and didn’t think about the environment, the bars and clubs.” Later, Mr. Steinberg said, many have called him to say they wanted to move.

Noise has come to dominate complaints to 311 since 2007, according to statistics on the NYC.gov Web site. “Last year 311 fielded over 300,000 noise complaints — the top complaint,” said John Feinblatt, the mayor’s criminal justice coordinator, when asked about relations between nightclubs and residents.

Many club and bar owners say the city favors those, like the West 12th Street residents, who seek a quiet night. And, they say, their cultural and economic contribution to the city is ignored: over $700 million in taxes and 95,500 jobs, according to a 2004 study by Audience Research and Analysis for the New York Nightlife Association — the most recent figures available.

“Nightclubs are now seen as nuisances,” said Steve Lewis, a nightclub designer and a founder of the Nightlife Preservation Community, a group started this year. “The attitude is that if clubs just went away, everybody could have a quiet life.”

One club owner, in the East Village, said 7 percent of his gross yearly revenue now went to fines, legal fees and lost revenue from raids. Another, in Chelsea, said that he expected to spend over $100,000 on such matters this year, and that one more raid would mean bankruptcy. A third, in the West Village, said he had been the victim of spurious 311 calls that had led to actions from the city.

For their part, police officials say they are trying to decrease the acrimony. Robert F. Messner, an assistant commissioner in the Police Department’s civil enforcement unit, said tensions had eased under a new system in which a dedicated senior officer in each of the eight patrol boroughs deals with club owners’ issues. Robert Bookman, a partner at Pesetsky & Bookman, a law firm that specializes in representing licensed establishments, said the improved communication had helped reduce the number of raids and shutdowns this year.

Marilyn Dorato, the director of the Greenwich Village Block Associations, who helped residents near the Beatrice Inn with their campaign, had a suggestion for compromise that helped on her own block: “We used to have a lot of noise problems with the Waverly Inn, and that is why my neighbor bought it.”

The neighbor, the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, enclosed the restaurant’s garden, and it now closes at 12:45 a.m. at the latest, said Ms. Dorato, a 37-year resident of the area.

“If there’s a Graydon Carter living near the Beatrice Inn who wants to buy it, that would be a great solution,” she said. “I recommend it.”
382 2009-08-15 The Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras reported Friday that second-quarter net profit fell 20 percent compared with the year earlier on lower global oil prices and higher finance costs. Petroleo Brasileiro said net earnings were 7.73 billion reais ($4.16 billion), compared with 9.72 billion reais in the second quarter of 2008. A lower price for crude oil, which fell 53 percent in the period, had a strong influence on the result, the company said. Production of oil and liquids rose 6 percent compared with the year-earlier quarter as new oil projects, including the Frade field under development with the Chevron Corporation, came online.

Investments totaled $32 billion for the first semester. The finance director, Almir Barbassa, said at a news conference that the 2009 investment target of $60 billion could be increased. Petrobras intends to invest $174 billion through 2013 in a plan to develop areas in the Santos Basin, where the immense Tupi field lies.
383 2009-08-15 The Food and Drug Administration is warning diabetes patients that certain blood sugar tests can give inaccurate results in patients taking other medications. Public health regulators told consumers not to use certain glucose testing strips from Roche, Abbott Laboratories and other companies in combination with dialysis and other biologic drugs. According to the agency, those formulations can elevate blood sugar level results falsely, raising the risk of insulin overdose.
384 2009-08-15 When I was actually at Woodstock, it never occurred to me anybody was going to want to discuss it 40 years down the road. In fact, the only time I envisioned the concert having any impact on my future was on the way home when I decided all of us were going to die in a massive traffic jam.

It was already dark when a girl walked up to my car — which was easy to approach, since we hadn’t moved for several hours — and said something like: “All the people ahead are going to sleep, so you might as well just settle down for the night.”

Then she gave me a flower and walked away. This was a sweet gesture, but I was so overwhelmed by the wish that the flower was, say, a saltine cracker, that I didn’t really respond.

As the hours slowly ticked by, I decided that the cars were never going to move again — and that months later rescuers would find our desiccated bodies, some collapsed behind the wheel, others slumped over the glove compartment where they expired while searching for a stray drop.

I fantasized that this mass tragedy would cause all the people over 30 to regret the terrible way that they had ignored the wise advice that the younger generation had been offering on how to run the world. Then the much-discussed revolution would finally occur, the world would achieve peace and harmony and we would be remembered as the Woodstock Martyrs who made it all happen.

Or, you know, we might just decide to get out of the cars and walk.

The Woodstock-mania must drive young people crazy since it is yet another reminder that the baby-boom generation is never going to stop talking about the stuff it did, and that when they are old themselves there will probably still be some 108-year-old telling them how everybody slept in the mud but that it was worth it because sounded so awesome and the people were all mellow.

Current younger generation, I know you would be equally good-natured if you found yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere, cut off from the world with 400,000 other people and a bunch of bands. But it will never happen because although you will have many, many fine adventures of your own, you will never be cut off.

My sister-in-law Laura just got back from the concert in , which was the exact opposite of Woodstock in the sense that it was an extremely pleasant way for a middle-aged person to spend a weekend.

The thing that struck her most — besides the misting tents, the corndogs and the truffled popcorn — was that “at any point you could look around and 50 percent of the people were texting or reading a text. Which is fine for keeping in touch, but I wonder how truly involved you can get with the music.”

As the person who went to Woodstock and didn’t see the concert, I can’t really comment on that last point. But 40 years ago, I knew eight people who would have killed for that lobster corndog.
385 2009-08-15 LOS ANGELES  When her assistant came into her office one day announcing that Michael D. Eisner, the former chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, was on the phone, Cyma Zarghami, the president of Nickelodeon Television, thought she knew why.

“I thought to myself, ‘Great  another zillionaire who is too cheap to pony up for a suite at the Nickelodeon hotel,’ ” Ms. Zarghami said at a recent meeting of the Television Critics Association.

It turns out he was not looking for a discount on lodging. Instead he was pitching a television show that he believed would fit in perfectly with Ms. Zarghami’s efforts to spruce up her network’s Nick at Nite franchise.

The result of their collaboration, “Glenn Martin, DDS,” a stop-motion animated comedy, will begin its run at 8 p.m. Monday, becoming one of only a few original series ever to grace the Nick at Nite lineup. After running nightly episodes through Thursday it will move to its regular weekly time period, on Mondays at 8 p.m., beginning Aug. 24.

The series is Nickelodeon’s attempt to extend the success of its Nick at Nite lineup, which has recently been transformed by the replacement of long-ago sitcoms, like “I Love Lucy,” with more contemporary favorites, like “The George Lopez Show,” “Malcolm in the Middle” and, beginning in September, “Everybody Hates Chris.” The first quarter of this year was the most-watched ever for Nick at Nite, which averaged 1.5 million viewers.

“Glenn Martin, DDS” focuses on a family whose father, Glenn, believes the members have lost touch with one another. His solution is to embark on a trip across the country in an RV with his wife, Jackie; his angst-ridden son, Conor; his budding-executive daughter, Courtney, who has her own personal assistant, Wendy; and an unusual family dog (more about him later). The title character is voiced by Kevin Nealon, the former “Saturday Night Live” comic who currently stars in “Weeds” on Showtime.

Ms. Zarghami said Nickelodeon’s research has indicated that the nighttime lineup is drawing considerable numbers of families who watch the network’s shows together  something, she said, that families said they have an increasingly difficult time doing with the broadcast networks’ menu of largely blow-’em-up, sex-’em-up fare.

Having read a newspaper article about her desire to bring original programming to Nick at Nite, Mr. Eisner recognized an opportunity.

“I wanted to go where I thought I had the greatest shot of having the show become successful,” he said in an interview. “I didn’t want to accept six episodes from a broadcast network and have it go into the abyss of their overall schedule.”

He added: “Cyma said, ‘If I give you 20 episodes will you do it with us?’ And I said yes, because I knew if there were 20 episodes on and we did it well I would then have an asset that could be forever.”

The show is the first television production from Mr. Eisner’s Tornante Company, which he founded in 2005 to invest in media and entertainment ventures. The company has already produced two Web series, “Back on Topps” and “Prom Queen,” which received critical accolades and drew millions of viewers, placing Tornante among the few successes at producing original Web programming.

Although Mr. Eisner is best known for his long and sometimes stormy tenure at Disney, “Glenn Martin” returns him to a medium in which he achieved some of his earliest success. The story of how Mr. Eisner, while snowbound at the Newark airport one winter, conceived and drafted a proposal for a show that became “Happy Days” is show-business legend. Today, he explained, his working methods vary little.

“When I have an idea, I’ve got to get it out on a piece of paper,” he said. “It’s stuck in my head on a to-do list, and until it’s all done I can’t relax. The way I ran all the companies I was at, whether it’s ABC or Paramount or Disney, was totally from an idea point of view: let’s put in this ride, let’s do this Broadway show, let’s do this television show, let’s do this movie, let’s do this acquisition.”

Part of the inspiration for “Glenn Martin,” it turns out, was something Mr. Eisner could not get out of his head for years. It shows up in the form of the Martins’ dog, Canine, who accompanies them on the RV trip.

“This idea actually began with a dog that was owned by Tom Staggs, who is the C.F.O. of Disney,” he recalled. “Occasionally on summer vacations we’d be together with our families, and he had this dog that was a Swiss Army dog. It was about the size of a table. It had a tail that went straight up in the air”  and, he added, a rear end that was “beyond disgusting.”

“But nobody ever said anything about it,” he said, “because what do you say? So when the dog was in the room, you just couldn’t even look at the dog because you would be obsessed with this part of the anatomy. And when the dog turned around and walked away from you  it was like, please. So I just wanted this dog in a television show.”

Nickelodeon commemorated that inspiration by handing out novelty plastic dogs that dispense chocolate-flavored brown jelly beans. That the network is willing to brave the expected jokes centered on what the dogs might imply about the quality of its lineup proves, if nothing else, its confidence in this new series.
386 2009-08-15 HONG KONG — Hong Kong climbed out of recession in the second quarter, joining a rising number of economies in Asia and some in Europe reporting surprisingly buoyant growth as the global downturn moderates.

Heavily reliant on trade and banking, the Hong Kong economy lurched into a recession when the financial world convulsed and Western demand for exports plummeted after the Lehman Brothers collapse 11 months ago.

But Hong Kong’s economy grew by a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter, more than analysts had expected, adding to evidence that the recovery was solidifying in much of Asia, according to data published Friday.

China, Singapore and South Korea have reported rebounds during the April-to-June period. On Thursday, Germany and France said their economies had grown slightly during the quarter, defying analysts’ expectations for a small decline. In the United States, the Federal Reserve made some of its most upbeat comments in months during this past week, saying the economy was leveling out as consumer spending and financial markets stabilized.

The stabilization also appears to be extending to Japan. Economists polled by Reuters expect statistics due Monday to show that the Japanese economy grew 1 percent in the April-to-June quarter, after contractions of 3.8 percent and 3.6 percent in the previous two quarters.
387 2009-08-15 A spokeswoman, Lori Gunter, said Friday that Boeing had created a patch to fix the wrinkling problem on the mid-fuselage section. She said the company had not disclosed the problem in June because it was not expected to affect the plane’s overall cost or production schedule.

But stock analysts said the problem would undoubtedly add to the nervousness about whether other flaws would surface with the plane, which is considered crucial to Boeing’s future.

The jetliner is supposed to be lighter and more fuel-efficient than other airliners, and Boeing has 850 advance orders. Even though the company says it has identified a fix for the structural problem involving the wings, it has not announced a new date for the first flight test. The plane is already two years behind its original schedule.

The problems with the wrinkling on the fuselage skin were first disclosed on Thursday by the FlightBlogger Web site. It quoted the stop-work order that Boeing issued to Alenia on June 23 as saying that the problems could “lead to significant degradation of the structure.”

Ms. Gunter, the Boeing spokeswoman, said the problem would be fixed with external patches, which would have to be applied to the first 23 planes.

She also said that while Alenia had not started any new mid-fuselage sections, it was continuing other work under its contract.

Boeing has outsourced much more of the production work on the 787 than on previous planes, to both American and foreign suppliers.

“So there’s an awful lot that we still don’t know about where things stand,” Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, said.

Shares of Boeing fell $1.75, or 3.8 percent, to close at $44.87 on Friday.
388 2009-08-15 Consumer prices in the United States were steady last month, easing concerns for now that the record deficit and huge new government spending would spur inflation.

“It could be a very large long-run problem,” said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. “But in the near term, it’s not a problem at all.”

The drift in prices suggests that enormous slack remains in the American economy, even as the recession bottoms out and some industries restart production. Retail sales are sluggish, 14.5 million people are unemployed and many factories and other businesses are still running below capacity.

The Labor Department reported Friday that its Consumer Price Index was unchanged from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, and that prices this summer were 2.1 percent lower than last July, when soaring oil costs drove gasoline to $4 a gallon and lifted the cost of food and other products.

The drop in the last year has been the largest in almost 60 years, occurring as the global economic crisis reduced demand for many goods and services.

“The inflation story was nonsense in an environment where you have such wild excess capacity globally,” said Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG, an investment advisory business. “I think inflation is below 2 percent for the next two years.”
389 2009-08-16 There’s nothing the style set loves more than a secret, and while the Rome-based jeweler Luigi Scialanga is something of an insider (he’s the partner of Giambattista Valli), his sculptural, one-of-a-kind designs have remained mostly under the radar. Which suits his clientele — fashion and social types like Alba Clemente, Mirella Petteni, Princess Alessandra Borghese and Sasha Pivovarova — just fine. An exhibition of his work, scheduled for next month at David Gill Galleries in London, might garner him a few more fans, but commerce isn’t his endgame. “I only make jewels when a material inspires me,” he says. The fashion historian Bronwyn Cosgrave, who curated the exhibit, is intrigued by the surreal quality of many of Scialanga’s designs. “Luigi’s jewels are similar in attitude to the ones Jean Cocteau produced for Schiaparelli,” she says. “The craftsmanship is impeccable, but there’s a free-form spirit that makes his work highly original and highly covetable.” [?][?][?] SANDRA BALLENTINE

393 2009-08-16 1988 The rule “excluded women from noncombat units or missions if the risks of exposure to direct combat, hostile fire or capture were equal to or greater than the risk in the units they supported.”

394 2009-08-16 “A Century-Old Principle: Keep Corporate Money Out of Politics,” by Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, Aug. 11), minimizes the significant First Amendment issues at stake in a case now before the Supreme Court.

A conservative group called Citizens United, the appellant in the case, produced a harshly critical movie about Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Under current federal law, the showing of the movie on television could have exposed the group to criminal penalties because Citizens United is partly financed by corporate grants and because the movie was shown close to Democratic primaries.

It should not be necessary to say more to indicate how serious the First Amendment issues are in the case and how dangerous the notion is that government may limit speech simply because it is even partly financed by corporations or unions. Federal law today threatens free expression of conservatives and liberals alike.

Mr. Cohen should recall the words of three of the Supreme Court’s liberal lions of an earlier generation. Writing in dissent in 1957, Justice William O. Douglas, Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Hugo Black put it this way: “Some may think that one group or another should not express its views in an election because it is too powerful [or] because it advocates unpopular ideas. ...But these are not justifications for withholding First Amendment rights from any group — labor or corporate.”

The writer, a prominent First Amendment lawyer, submitted an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Senator Mitch McConnell to the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case.
395 2009-08-16 Drogba’s winning goal came on a cross from a sharp angle that floated over Hull’s goalkeeper and inside the far post.

Manchester City, which spent heavily over the summer in an attempt to win its first trophy since 1976, beat Blackburn, 2-0, on goals by Emmanuel Adebayor and Stephen Ireland. Manchester City has spent almost $166 million on new players, including Adebayor, since the end of last season.

E.P.L. ON ESPN ESPN will carry 48 live matches from the English Premier League on Saturdays and Mondays in the United States, the cable network announced Friday night, hours before the start of the 2009-10 Premier League season. The network began its coverage with the Chelsea-Hull City match Saturday morning.

Chelsea played its first game under its new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, and American viewers had hoped to see the debut of Jozy Altidore, who has just joined Hull City on a season-long loan from Villarreal in Spain. But late Friday, in a posting on Twitter, Altidore said that work still needed to be done on his British work visa and that he was still in the United States.

Altidore said in his post: “Bad news guys. Still in the States trying to sort things out with my work permit. There is a lil more work that has to be done.” Hull Chairman Paul Duffen said Saturday that he hoped to complete the signing of Altidore by Tuesday. JACK BELL

RED BULLS LOSE AGAIN Maykel Galindo scored off a feed from Chukwudi Chijindu in the 15th minute, and Eduardo Lillingston added a goal late in added time in Chivas USA’s 2-0 victory over the reeling Red Bulls at the Meadowlands. Chivas USA (9-7-3) ended a five-game losing streak and moved into a tie with Colorado for third place in the Western Conference. The beleaguered Red Bulls, an M.L.S.-worst 2-16-4, are winless in 14 consecutive league games and in 16 straight over all since beating San Jose on May 8. (AP)

SKY BLUE ADVANCES IN PLAYOFFS Two second-half substitutes — Natasha Kai and Francielle — scored Saturday for Sky Blue F.C. in a 2-1 victory over the Washington Freedom and put the team one victory from playing in the championship game of Women’s Professional Soccer. Kai entered the match in the 54th minute and scored a minute later. Francielle, a 29-year-old striker from Brazil, entered the match in the 61st minute and scored the winner in the 84th. The victory sent Sky Blue to what the league is calling a Super Semifinal, against St. Louis Athletica on Wednesday in Fenton, Mo. The winner of that game will advance to next Saturday’s title match against the Los Angeles Sol. The Sol won the right to host the championship game as the league’s top team with 41 points during the 20-game regular season. JACK BELL

396 2009-08-16 That the early ’60s of “Mad Men” seems more contemporary than the late ’60s of Woodstock has little to do with the earlier period’s style or culture in any case (however superior the clothes). The rock giants of Woodstock remain exponentially more popular than Vic Damone and Perry Como, the forgotten crooners heard in “Mad Men.” The repressive racial and sexual order of Sterling Cooper, the show’s fictional ad agency, is also a relic, in part because of the revolutions that accelerated in the Woodstock era. The misogyny, racism and homophobia practiced in the executive suites of “Mad Men” are hardly extinct — and neither are the that most of the characters chain-smoke — but they are in various stages of remission.

What makes the show powerful is not nostalgia for an America that few want to bring back — where women were most valued as sex objects or subservient housewives, where blacks were, at best, second-class citizens, and where the hedonistic guzzling of gas and gin went unquestioned. Rather, it’s our identification with an America that, for all its serious differences with our own, shares our growing anxiety about the prospect of cataclysmic change. “Mad Men” is about the dawn of a new era, and we, too, are at such a dawn. And we are uncertain and worried about what comes next.

In his new book “1959: The Year Everything Changed,” Fred Kaplan writes about the forces that were roiling America in the year before “Mad Men” begins. It was in 1959 that Berry Gordy founded Motown, that G. D. applied to the F.D.A. for approval of the birth-control pill, and that announced the advent of the microchip. The year began with a Soviet technological triumph, the launching of the spacecraft Lunik I, and ended with an embarrassing capitalist fiasco, ’s yanking of the ignominious Edsel. Along the way the first two American soldiers were killed in South . “By the end of 1959,” Kaplan writes, “all the elements were in place for the upheavals of the subsequent decades.”

The first season of “Mad Men” was set in 1960. This season — and there will be no spoilers here — opens in 1963. That’s the year of Beatlemania’s first sightings, of the Rev. Dr. ’s march on Washington and, of course, of gunfire in . Bruce Handy sums it up in the current Vanity Fair: “As in Hitchcock, the characters are unaware of shocks that the audience knows all too well lie ahead, whether they be the Kennedy assassination and women’s lib or long sideburns and the lasting influence of Doyle Dane Bernbach’s witty, self-deprecating ‘lemon’ ad for .”

What we don’t know is how the characters will be rocked by these changes. But we’re reasonably certain it won’t be pretty. That’s where the drama is, and it’s tense.

In the world of television, “Mad Men” is notorious for drawing great press and modest audiences. This could be the season when the viewers catch up, in part because the show is catching up to the level of we feel in 2009. In the first two seasons, the series was promoted with the slogan This year, it’s “The World’s Gone Mad.” The ad hyping the season premiere depicts the impeccably dressed Don Draper, the agency executive played by , sitting in his office calmly a Lucky Strike as floodwater rises to his waist.

To be underwater — well, many Americans know what that’s like right now. But we are also at that 1963-like pivot point of our history, with a new young president unlike any we’ve seen before, and with the promise of a new frontier whose boundaries are a mystery. Something is happening here, as framed this mood the last time around, but you don’t know what it is. We feel Don Draper’s as his once rock-solid ’50s America starts to be swept away. We recognize his fear that the world could go mad.

It’s through this prism we might re-examine the raucous town hall eruptions this month. Even if they are inflated by activist organizations and cable-TV overexposure, they still cannot be dismissed entirely as made-for-media phenomena made-to-measure to fill the August news vacuum. Nor are they necessarily about health care. The twisted distortions about “death panels” and federal conspiracies “to pull the plug on grandma” are just too unhinged from the reality of any actual legislation. These bogus fears are psychological proxies for bigger traumas.

“It’s the economy, the facts that millions of people have lost their jobs and millions of others are afraid of losing theirs,” theorizes one heckled senator, . That’s surely part of it. So is fear of more home foreclosures and credit card bankruptcies. So is fear of , whose economic ascension stands in stark contrast to the collapse of traditional American industries from automobiles to newspapers. So is fear of , whose political ascension dramatizes the coming demographic order that will relegate whites to the American minority. In our uncharted new frontier, even the most reliable fixture for a half-century of American public life, the Kennedy family, is crumbling.

These anxieties coalesce in various permutations right, left and center. In most cases they don’t surface in the explosions we’re seeing at these town hall meetings but in the kind of quiet desperation that afflicts Don Draper and his cohort in “Mad Men.” But this summer’s explosions are also in keeping with 1963.

The political rage at the young, liberal Kennedy administration in some quarters that year was rabid and ominous. When Adlai Stevenson, then ambassador to the , spoke in Dallas that October, jeering zealots spat on him and struck him with a picketer’s placard. Stevenson advised Kennedy against traveling there. Dallas rushed to draft a new city ordinance restricting protesters’ movements at lawful assemblies and passed it on Nov. 18. We need not watch “Mad Men” to learn how that turned out.

Oh, to be back in the idyllic summer of 1969, when the biggest sin committed by the rebellious mobs at Woodstock was getting stoned. Something else is happening here in our anxious summer of 2009, when instead of flower-power and free love there are reports of death threats and fanatics packing guns.
397 2009-08-16 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — The son of a civil rights leader said that he planned to seek pardons on behalf of his father, who was arrested many times while helping organize the Montgomery bus boycott and protests against segregation in Birmingham, Ala.

Ralph David Abernathy III of Atlanta said Friday that he would apply for the pardons for his father, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who died in 1990, under a 2006 Alabama law that provided a mechanism for granting them to people arrested in civil rights protests.

Mayor Larry Langford of Birmingham said he would use the law to pardon thousands, including Mr. Abernathy, who was arrested during protests in Birmingham. Mr. Langford acknowledged that some might not want the pardons because they considered their arrests a badge of honor, but the younger Mr. Abernathy said that was not a concern for him.

“Anytime a city or government agency is seeking to pardon and apologize and forgive in a spirit of good will and righteousness,” he said, “I think the right thing to do is to accept it.”

His father was pastor of Montgomery’s historic First Baptist Church on Ripley Street in the 1950s and was a close friend and associate of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Many have called Mr. Abernathy Dr. King’s “right-hand man.”

Mr. Abernathy was with Dr. King when he was assassinated in 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where the two had been sharing a room.

The bill to pardon civil rights protesters passed the Legislature in 2006 and was named the Rosa Parks Act after the civil rights figure who was arrested in Montgomery for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. Until Mr. Langford’s announcement, no pardons had been issued.
398 2009-08-16 The human rights group Survival International reported last week that the disease had reached Amazonian Indians, as seven members of the Matsigenka tribe in Peru were infected.

The United States and Mexico have not reported alarming disease rates in Indian areas, although one resident of the Gila River Indian reservation in Arizona died of swine flu in May, and there have been mild outbreaks on other reservations. But the flu in both countries began late in the spring and concentrated first in urban areas like Mexico City and New York; patterns could change in the fall.

“We’ve seen rural and indigenous populations affected in northern Canada, in rural Australia and in the western U.S.,” said Joshua A. Mott, an epidemiologist in the flu division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. “We’re focusing on what puts them at risk.”

Experts say the danger is more likely related to malnutrition, chronic disease and geographic isolation than to genetic differences. Australian Aborigines, for example, are not closely related to Amazonian Indians, but they share the ills of rural poverty.

“Different aboriginal people around the world are very different genetically,” Dr. Mott said, “so there might be other underlying conditions and problems with access to care. We haven’t come to any conclusions.”

Australia is in the middle of its winter flu season, and Aborigines have much higher rates of the diseases that cause flu complications every year.

They have two to seven times the rates of heart disease, asthma and diabetes of other Australians, said the government’s Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and their life span, on average, is 18 years shorter.

Health officials say they are stepping up measures to stop the flu here, but some Aboriginal leaders and health activists say it is not enough.

In the outbreak’s first weeks, the government imposed severe measures, like sending even healthy schoolchildren home for a week if they had visited a country with cases, and quarantining an entire cruise ship. It also used radio and television messages to urge people to wash their hands, cover their mouths when coughing and stay home when sick.

Indigenous leaders say these messages have rarely reached their remote towns, where health facilities are scarce, illiteracy rates are high and English is often a second or third language.

“There are a lot of barriers in terms of culture and particularly cultural awareness for people who are working in Aboriginal communities,” said Alf Lacey, the mayor of Palm Island, a large Aboriginal community in tropical northern Queensland. “Putting up a generic poster isn’t going to do much good if you’re dealing with people who can’t read.”

More than a dozen people fell ill when swine flu swept Palm Island in July, including a 19-year-old woman who was airlifted out in critical condition. Schools and day care centers were closed, and many people panicked.

As a result, the Queensland government opened a flu clinic on the island, created health messages aimed at Aborigines and sent extra supplies of drugs and equipment.

But Mr. Lacey and some health experts are skeptical that such a top-down approach will work.

Although health officials realize that they must recruit local leaders to have a chance of success, aboriginal communities vary greatly in culture, language and tradition, forcing national officials to devote more time and effort than they want to spare, said Dr. Michael Gracey, who has been working with Aboriginal communities for 40 years.

“One has to work through the local people, through the elders, through the community leaders and through the community councils,” said Dr. Gracey, who recently published a review of indigenous health in The Lancet, a British medical journal. “A lot of health professionals think they’re too busy, or they’re too impatient.”

Health experts predict that more than a quarter of Australia’s 21 million people will eventually catch swine flu, and Nicola Roxon, the national health minister, warned last month that as many as 6,000 could die this year. The typical seasonal flu kills about 2,800 Australians, most of them frail and elderly.

Human trials of a vaccine began in Australia in July, even earlier than they did in the United States, which is just beginning them. The government has contracts to purchase 21 million doses, though it is not clear yet whether each person will need one or two shots.

“Everyone is clamoring for it,” said Russell Basser, the director of clinical development for CSL Biotherapies, the Australian biotech company making the vaccine. Unfortunately, he said, it cannot be used until the trials are finished, by which time the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season will be largely over.

If all goes well, the government will begin vaccinations in October, giving priority to Aborigines, as well as to health care workers and to others at high risk.

Until then, many indigenous people remain nervous.

Sitting on a wall outside the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, where visitors are ordered to wear face masks and avoid patients with flulike symptoms, one Aboriginal mother said she feared for her children.

“Yeah, I’m scared to send her to school because it’s been going around,” said the mother, Kelly McGrady, pointing to her young daughter. “I’m worried she’s going to catch it.”
399 2009-08-16 MOSCOW (AP) — A ransom demand has been received for the return of a Russian-operated freighter that disappeared last month in the Atlantic, Finnish investigators said Saturday.

Markku Ranta-Aho, of Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation, told national YLE radio that the ransom demand was for “a largish amount of money.” He said the demand was addressed to the Finland-based company that owns the ship, the Arctic Sea, but he would not give details for fear of endangering the crew.

It was not immediately clear if the ransom demand was legitimate, and the whereabouts of the Arctic Sea, its 15 crew members and its cargo of timber remain a mystery.

Crew members had said the ship was attacked in Swedish waters four days before it disappeared July 28, but there has been no confirmation that the ship was actually seized. The French Navy said Saturday that the ship was probably near Cape Verde, the island nation off West Africa.

The Arctic Sea set out from Finland on July 23 and was due in an Algerian port on Aug. 4. It vanished after passing through the English Channel.

Crew members had reported the ship was attacked on July 24 in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish island of Oland. They said a dozen masked men boarded the ship, tied them up, beat them, questioned them about drug trafficking and searched the freighter before leaving.
400 2009-08-16 Officials acknowledge that the government routinely fails when trying to speak to the Muslim world and battle the propaganda of extremism — most often because the efforts to describe American policy and showcase American values are themselves viewed as propaganda.

The new campaign is especially focused on providing cellphone service, and thus some independent communications for people in remote areas where the Taliban thrive. It is a booming industry now: Afghanistan had no cellular coverage in 2001 but today has about 9.5 million subscribers.

That work is closely coordinated with American and allied forces in Afghanistan, where Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, NATO’s director of communication in Kabul, said the challenge was in protecting the population and the official communications network from insurgents — a new strategic priority.

“If we can insulate the people, separate the population from insurgents, they become less vulnerable and less susceptible to the coercion and intimidation designed to steer them away from the government of Afghanistan,” Admiral Smith said.

“The ability to communicate empowers a population,” he said. “That is a very important principle of counterinsurgency and counterpropaganda.”

In southern Afghanistan, now the center of American military offensives under the troop increase ordered by President Obama, insurgents threaten commercial cellphone providers with attack if they do not switch off service early each night.

That prevents villagers from calling security forces if they see militants on the move or planting roadside bombs; the lack of cellphone service at night also hobbles the police and nongovernmental development agencies.

Proposals to counter insurgent threats include establishing security for cellphone towers by offering local communities money, electricity or free service to guard the towers — or even erecting cellphone towers, which cost about $200,000 each, on allied military bases.

Expanding and securing cellphone service has the additional benefit of assisting economic development, officials said, as it could provide wireless access to banking systems for those who now must travel long distances for financial services.

Officials involved in the new unit say they are seeking to amplify the voices of Afghans speaking to Afghans, and Pakistanis speaking to Pakistanis, rather than have “Made in the U.S.A.” stamped on the programming.

And officials said the counterpropaganda unit would seek ways to “denigrate the enemy,” portraying militant attacks on markets, schools and public buildings as a religious violation.

“Given the archaic values of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, we must devise policies that expose the true nature of the militants,” said Ashley Bommer, an adviser to Mr. Holbrooke. “And we must shift the paradigm so that the debate is not between the United States and the militants, but between the people and the militants.”

Officials said the unit would work to counter the primary routes of extremist communications, in particular low-power radio stations and the distribution of videos, CDs and “night letters” — chilling militant notes that threaten violence if local residents cooperate with the government, America or its allies.

Vikram Singh, on loan from the Pentagon as Mr. Holbrooke’s senior defense adviser for the project, said the United States would begin by “building the capabilities of the private sectors and the governments in both of these countries to effectively communicate and engage with their own populations.”

This is particularly important, he said, in the border areas of Pakistan and across large parts of Afghanistan that for decades had only primitive communications.

In the tribal areas of Pakistan, for example, there are only four legal FM radio stations, compared with more than 150 illegal low-watt stations run by militants, according to officials involved in the counterpropaganda effort. Some of the insurgent radio stations are mobile, broadcasting from vehicles or even donkey carts to avoid detection and extend their reach.
401 2009-08-16 Re “Imperfect Politics of Pay” (Fair Game, Aug. 9), about the executive pay bill passed by the House of Representatives:

My career was spent consulting in executive compensation, predominantly on Wall Street and as it related to I.P.O.’s, acquisitions, buyouts, etc. The thorniness of the issues involved in designing robust plans — or in redesigning ill-conceived ones — demanded much hard work of financially trained, analytics-oriented teams. They tried to figure out how plans might be “gamed” and to plug those holes beforehand, on behalf of shareholders.

From time to time in my experience, we went back to management or a board to say a plan’s design was impossible because the underlying business model was flawed or the degree of risk untenable.

Today, the work is exponentially more complicated with increasingly complex financial instruments, the intransigence of the bonus culture and the egregious amounts of money at stake.

Now, it seems, government is going to write a bigger bunch of regulations and then send out a bunch of fresh-faced, well-meaning “enforcement” bureaucrats — a taxpayer-funded solution that is expensive and futile.
402 2009-08-16 Emily Christine Kehm and Austin Taylor Smith were married Saturday at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Des Moines. The Rev. Parker Jameson, an Episcopal priest and the bridegroom’s godfather, performed the ceremony.

Mrs. Kehm Smith, 25, is to begin teaching English to fifth- through eighth-grade students at St. Thomas Choir School in New York in September. She graduated magna cum laude from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn. In September, she is also to start her second and final year of a master’s in the teaching of English at Teachers College at Columbia University.

She is a daughter of Diane Christine Kehm and David Kehm of Des Moines. Her mother is the vice principal of Merrill Middle School there. Her father is a certified public accountant for the Des Moines Public Schools.

Mr. Smith, also 25, is a senior software developer at economist.com, the Web site for The Economist magazine. He works in New York.

He is a son of Debra Morris Smith and the Rt. Rev. George Wayne Smith of St. Louis. His mother is an educational coordinator at the Parkway Area Adult Education and Literacy/English as a Second Language Program, a nonprofit organization in St. Louis. His father is the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri.
403 2009-08-16 Morgan Rissel and Bill Upton Tarr were married Saturday in Ojai, Calif. Saral Burdette, a Universal Life minister, officiated at the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa.

Until last week, Mrs. Tarr, 33, was a financial adviser and partner in Fort Point Capital Partners, an investment management firm in San Francisco that she helped found. She is also a board member of the Bay Institute, which operates the Aquarium of the Bay in San Francisco; she is also a vice president of the board of its nonprofit supporting foundation. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford.

She is a daughter of Katie Van Horne of Ojai, and Dr. Richard C. Rissel of Lafayette Calif. The bride’s father, a semiretired pediatric dentist, has a practice in Concord, Calif. Her mother is a portrait and landscape artist whose work is represented by OjaiStyle, a gallery in Ojai. The bride is a stepdaughter of Kathleen Rissel.

Mr. Tarr, 34, is the principal partner in and a founder of Aquillian Investments, a firm in San Francisco that invests in companies specializing in renewable energy and other clean technologies. He graduated from Dartmouth.

He is a son of Molly Upton Tarr and Robert J. Tarr Jr. of Kiawah Island, S.C. The bridegroom’s mother retired as a special-education teacher at Arlington High School in Arlington Mass. His father, also retired, was the chief executive and chief operating officer of Harcourt General of Chestnut Hill, Mass., which was a bookseller and publishing company.
404 2009-08-16 “The seats behind home plate, no one wants to be seen there,” said John Lieberman, the former chairman of the entertainment and sports committee of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. “There’s a perception that you’re throwing your money away. Politically, it’s like car company executives taking private jets from Michigan to Washington.”

Baseball was the first major sport to begin a full season in this more spartan environment. Yet with new seasons approaching, basketball and hockey teams are trying to find takers for suites that were not renewed by financial firms. Many corporate hospitality tents sat unused at the United States Open at Bethpage this June, one reason annual revenue at the United States Golf Association is expected to be about 20 percent below the projections made before the economic collapse.

“The bankers we did business with in the past have eliminated purchases or scaled back to minimal amounts,” said Jason Berger, the managing partner of AllShows.com, one of the largest ticket brokers in New York. “A few years ago, they were focused on the best, best seats. Now they’re under a tremendous amount of scrutiny, especially under TARP, so we’re seeing almost no spending.”

The belt-tightening on Wall Street could have severe consequences for the Mets and the Yankees, which opened their stadiums this season and, more than most teams, expected free-spending bankers, brokers and fund managers to fill top seats. The teams initially priced some tickets so high — as much as $2,500 each — that the sight of empty box seats became a symbol of excess and hubris. The teams have since discounted some of their seats by as much as 50 percent.

The financial industry’s troubles could prompt teams across the country to re-evaluate their reliance on corporate dollars.

“There’s been a level of greed that runs the risk of destroying what makes the business a business,” said Paul Swangard, the managing director at the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon School of Business. “Believing that people always will pay more may need to be corrected.”

Some season-ticket holders who have found it hard to use their seats to entertain clients, and who have had trouble reselling their tickets online, are considering canceling their plans next year.

“People turned us down before, but it has gotten much worse as the face value of the tickets keeps rising,” said one executive with a financial search firm who has four $225 box seats at Citi Field. “This year, it’s completely dried up.”

Like others interviewed for this article, the executive declined to be identified for fear of bringing attention to his company or risking the appearance of seeming too extravagant. The executive and others said companies had recently fired employees for violating entertainment policies.

Representatives of the Mets and the Yankees declined to speak specifically about their season-ticket holders or about whether the teams were being affected by stricter corporate policies.

Asset managers like Vanguard and General Electric Asset Management have prohibited some or all of their employees from accepting sports tickets. So far this year, the compliance department at Vanguard has turned down two requests from employees who wanted to accept tickets.

At Oppenheimer Funds, employees invited to attend with a client can cover the cost of any ticket with a face value exceeding $100.

“It’s really the personal decision of the employee whether they want to spend the extra money,” said Jeaneen Pisarra, a spokeswoman for Oppenheimer.

But given the escalating price of tickets, many bankers simply say no.

“A lot of people have gotten hurt by this stuff, so it’s easier to just not do it,” said one director at a firm that manages pension funds. “More than the price, it’s just the nature of the environment out there, so it’s not worth the risk.”

In its newly updated code of conduct, American Express, which took $3.4 billion in government funds, said employees could not accept or offer entertainment considered “excessive in value,” “not business-related” or “in an inappropriate setting.”

At Bank of America, managers are encouraged to skip the expensive sporting events and “leverage their existing routines,” according to Kelly Sapp, a spokeswoman. But when they do accept an invitation, she said, the entertainment cannot be “lavish, frequent or contrary to Bank of America guidelines.”

At JPMorgan Chase, employees are permitted to accept tickets on a case-by-case basis, according to a spokeswoman. But legitimate business has to take place, which means the host has to be present, the event has to be held at a “reputable venue” and the ticket value must be “reasonable.”

The bank’s compliance department, she said, would probably deny requests to accept Super Bowl or World Series tickets because they “would be deemed as lavish and unreasonable.”

The bank’s policies language echoes the Treasury Department’s standards for compensation and corporate governance for TARP recipients.

In an internal memo sent in July, JPMorgan Asset Management told employees in its Institutional Americas division that “in light of the current regulatory environment,” they would not be allowed to entertain clients at the United States Open tennis tournament this month.

The United States Tennis Association said it might sell 700,000 tickets to the event, just under last year’s record attendance. But this year, companies are being allowed to rent suites for less than the entire two-week tournament.

“Going into 2009, we recognized the new economic environment in the country and its impact on events like ours,” said Chris Widmaier, a spokesman for the U.S.T.A. “This will not be business as usual.”
405 2009-08-16 WASHINGTON — As White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel was the one to bring the hammer down on Sidney Blumenthal .

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wanted to hire Mr. Blumenthal, a loyal confidant who had helped her promote the idea of a “vast right-wing conspiracy” more than a decade ago. But President Obama’s campaign veterans still blamed him for spreading harsh attacks against their candidate in the primary showdown with Mrs. Clinton last year.

So Mr. Emanuel talked with Mrs. Clinton, said Democrats informed about the situation, and explained that bringing Mr. Blumenthal on board was a no-go. The bad blood among his colleagues was too deep, and the last thing the administration needed, he concluded, was dissension and drama in the ranks. In short, Mr. Blumenthal was out.

Perhaps nothing illustrates how far Mr. Emanuel has come than that conversation last month. Sixteen years ago, it was Mrs. Clinton, then first lady, who helped have Mr. Emanuel demoted as a senior official in Bill Clinton’s White House after he ruffled feathers with his aggressive style. Now all these years later, it is Mr. Emanuel telling Mrs. Clinton what she cannot do as a member of the cabinet.

Seven months after moving into his office in the West Wing, Mr. Emanuel is emerging as perhaps the most influential White House chief of staff in a generation. But with his prominence in almost everything important going on in Washington comes a high degree of risk.

As the principal author of Mr. Obama’s do-everything-at-once strategy, he stands to become a figure of consequence in his own right if the administration stabilizes the economy and financial markets, overhauls the health care system and winds down one war while successfully prosecuting another.

If things do not go well — and right now Mr. Obama’s political popularity is declining, his health care legislation is under conservative assault, the budget deficit is at an eye-popping level and Afghanistan remains volatile — it is Mr. Emanuel whose job will be on the line before Mr. Obama’s.

“He’s about to be tested; he’s spinning a lot of plates over there and he breaks a lot of china,” said Joel Johnson, a close friend and fellow veteran official of the Clinton White House. “They’ve had some good success early on, but they’ve got a number of major pieces of the agenda in the queue, and it’s going to be really difficult.”

The caricature of Mr. Emanuel as a profanity-spewing operative has given way to a more nuanced view: as a profanity-spewing operative with a keen understanding of how to employ power on behalf of a new president with relatively little experience in Washington.

Although relentlessly deferential to the president, Mr. Emanuel is clearly more chief than staff. While some predecessors husbanded their authority, lest it be diluted, friends said he believed the more someone used power, the more power that person had.

He knows how to pull all the levers of influence in Washington — raising money, mobilizing interest groups and harvesting the latest policy ideas from research groups. At the same time, his relentless campaign-style approach sometimes leaves some colleagues worried they spend too much time reacting to events.

At times, it seems as if Mr. Emanuel is White House chief of staff, political director, legislative director and communications director all rolled into one. He has fingers in almost every decision, like who gets invited to social events at the White House and how to shape economic and foreign policy.

He carries a notecard in his pocket with a list of things to accomplish and marks them off obsessively. He requires cabinet secretaries and all West Wing departments to submit written reports each week and returns them with terse notes in the margins.

As negotiations intensified on health care recently, he was a constant presence on Capitol Hill — one day alone, he was there 8.5 hours before returning to the White House to tend to other duties.

“He can juggle 20 or 25 things in one day, in part by delegating and in part by picking only the things that matter,” said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a Republican congressman recruited by Mr. Emanuel to serve in the cabinet.

Where Mr. Obama is known for cool detachment, Mr. Emanuel presses until the breaking point, then presses some more. “The president has a zenlike quality,” said Mr. Obama’s senior adviser, David Axelrod. “Rahm is a pile driver.”

Attention has focused on Mr. Emanuel’s larger-than-life personality, but it is his operating style that matters more to Mr. Obama at this crucial juncture. What comes through in interviews with roughly 60 people in the White House, on Capitol Hill and around Washington is an intense engagement built on a series of testosterone-driven aphorisms:

“A man never stands as tall as when he is on all fours kissing” rear ends.

In other words, take what victories you can, stay on the offensive and do not be afraid to stroke big egos to advance the president’s agenda.
406 2009-08-16 WHEN the jazz singer Vanessa Rubin takes the stage for the second half of “Yesterdays  An Evening With Billie Holiday,” she’s still wearing Billie’s floor-length white satin evening dress, the flashing earrings, the silver shoes we saw in Act I. The only difference is a small raspberry-colored dot on one of her long white fingerless gloves.

The audience at Hartford Stage has used the intermission to visit the bar or the rest room; in Reenie Upchurch’s concert-drama, Billie has used it to get a fix. It’s not just the little red stain that gives her away  Act II of the show, directed by Woodie King Jr., has Billie rambling incoherently, staggering around, even nodding out in midsong.

In her program note, Ms. Upchurch describes seeing just such a performance, near the end of the descent that took Ms. Holiday from jazz stardom in the 1930s and ’40s to addiction and notoriety in the ’50s. “It was the saddest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Ms. Upchurch writes, and in “Yesterdays,” she seems to be trying to redeem that evening, to allow Billie the incomparable singer to make amends for Billie the human wreck.

The show is a fictional rendering of Ms. Holiday’s final appearance in New York, where she died in 1959. Onstage at a small nightclub, Billie banters with her exasperated musicians, struggles to get through her set and reminisces  sometimes bitterly, sometimes jovially  about her past. She recalls the Bessie Smith records that helped get her through a traumatized childhood, the men who managed to extend her misery into adulthood, the racism she faced as one of the first black vocalists to tour with a white band.

Ably supported by Levi Barcourt on piano, Bernard Davis on drums and David Jackson on bass, Ms. Rubin darkens her normally bright voice to achieve a sound closer to Ms. Holiday’s late-career smokiness. And she laces more than a dozen Holiday standards  “God Bless the Child,” “Don’t Explain” and “Fine and Mellow” among them  with the bluesy phrasing and emotional heft that made Ms. Holiday’s performances legendary.

The contrast between Ms. Holiday’s transcendent singing and her sorry life is inherently theatrical. (In fact, it’s been exploited in another, similar play, Lanie Robertson’s “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill.”) Still, Ms. Upchurch feels the need to add a clunky dramatic device. Her Billie tells the audience that there are narcotics detectives in the house, and she knows they will arrest her the moment she leaves the stage. On the one hand, it seems an unnecessary distraction. On the other, Ms. Holiday herself had a keen appreciation for a good yarn, and she took every opportunity to embroider the details of her history for effect.

“Yesterdays” is not much interested in separating fact from myth. It settles for getting at the truths laid bare in Ms. Holiday’s music. They are more than enough for an evening.
407 2009-08-16 From a distance, they’re just two well-groomed, neatly dressed middle-age women getting together for a leisurely cup of coffee. But draw closer. In “Women Who Steal,” now zipping and darting across the Penguin Repertory Theater stage, you’ll hear Woman No. 1 demanding the details of Woman No. 2’s recent affair. With No. 1’s husband.

At first, Karen (Stephanie Dorian), a k a No. 2, is babbling away  with the pointed words of Carter W. Lewis, the playwright  about cheery subjects like hope as “the universal deception,” something “invented by smart people for the maintenance of stupid people.”

But what Peggy (Liz Zazzi) really wants to hear about is whether her husband, Jack, has slept with Karen and, if so, how often, where and when. For some reason, the answers (just once, at a hotel, on Christmas Eve) lead the women to bond, get into a car and drive to the Barking Hammer bar for what look like martinis and cosmos. One minute, these ladies seem like strangers (Karen keeps addressing Peggy as Patty). The next minute, they’re practically Thelma and Louise, complete with firearms.

Penguin Rep’s production, directed by SuzAnne Barabas, is essentially the New Jersey Repertory Theater production that Ms. Barabas did in Long Branch last year: same actresses and most of the same backstage team. The one cast change is the appearance of Mark Shanahan, a Penguin Rep veteran, deftly playing all the male characters. The men include a phony waiter, Peggy’s husband and a geeky co-worker of Karen’s. That last characterization requires Mr. Shanahan to disguise his usual sexy charm, and he does it disconcertingly well. (“I have a mother who depends on me,” he pleads at one point in an Arnold Stang-like voice. “I have a cat.”)

Karen has problems of her own. This is the eve of her 40th birthday, and there’s no man in her life. She thinks Stanley, the co-worker, may be attracted to her, but she’s not sure. So why not go to his house and barge in on him in his bedroom in the middle of the night, carrying a rifle?

If “Women Who Steal” has a problem, it’s that the women’s strange behavior doesn’t always seem justified by the dialogue and actions that have gone before  although the characters’ considerable alcohol consumption could account for some of it. The disjointedness may be a flaw in Mr. Lewis’s script or Ms. Barabas’s generally lively direction or the actresses’ otherwise fine performances. Or maybe it’s a little of all three. Absurdism is always a tricky proposition.

Speaking of tricky propositions: Mr. Lewis has written this play from a feminine and feminist viewpoint. According to the program biography, he lives in St. Louis with his dog, Bucket, so it would appear that he does not have a live-in consultant on that point of view.

But maybe that doesn’t matter, because his is a theoretical, outsider-interpreted feminism. At last Sunday’s matinee, when Peggy did her long rant about men not understanding horrors like estrogen-induced mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, fibroids, vaginitis and the pain of dermabrasion, the men in the audience seemed to be laughing more than the women. Especially when Peggy announced that she was sick and tired of hearing about men’s prostate problems.

Descriptions of “Women Who Steal” suggest that Karen is younger and far more attractive than Peggy. In this production, Ms. Dorian and Ms. Zazzi seem equally matched in terms of age and beauty. So the casting may detract from the playwright’s message. Maybe something could have been done with hair, makeup and costume to emphasize the characters’ differences. Patricia E. Doherty, the costume designer, has put both women in undistinguished fashions.

The real beauty is the unlikely joy in Mr. Lewis’s worldview, which can be summarized as: Life is absolutely the worst, but let’s do our best, hard as it is, to have a good time anyway. At two minutes after midnight, when Karen realizes her milestone birthday has arrived, Peggy tells her: “You’re 40 now. There’s absolutely no reason ever to be sober again.”
408 2009-08-16 Having just returned from last night’s Crosby, Stills & Nash concert, where the requisite ID for admission was my AARP card, I read Mr. Pareles’s article with interest.

Although he decries “the realities of capitalism” that govern the musical landscape, part of the reason that “the sensation lingers” is that the film and musical recordings, newly refurbished in their current digital incarnation, have continued to preserve the legacy not just for those of us who were of age then, but for our children as well, who get to chuckle at old photos of Daddy’s long hair and hear some enjoyable stories and great music.
409 2009-08-16 Mr. Steel reached an agreement with the orchestra union, which made significant concessions. “I can’t say enough how great it was to work with the committee from the orchestra,” Mr. Steel said. “The orchestra showed great leadership.”

The City Opera season is scheduled to start on Nov. 5 with “American Voices,” a gala program of songs and choruses from American operas and musicals. Two days later comes a revival of Hugo Weisgall’s formidable opera “Esther,” a San Francisco Opera commission that received its premiere in 1993 at City Opera in a limited but enthusiastically received run. This production, the first of only five for the season, should truly reveal the artistic state of the City Opera.

Walking around the auditorium on Monday, dodging sparks from welders and ducking under hanging cables, I had to wonder whether construction would be finished in time for the company to move in on Oct. 20, as scheduled. The renovation of the building will eventually cost about $200 million. Some $85 million of that is being spent on this first phase. But the changes are already striking.

An expanded orchestra pit should be able to accommodate up to 90 players. (The old pit typically held 65, with a potential of up to 75.) A new elevator allows the pit to be adjusted: raised for a Baroque opera with a modest instrumental ensemble; lowered for a work like “Esther,” with its heavy scoring. The pit’s floor, which used to be plywood on concrete, will now have air space underneath to enhance the resonance of the sound. There will be sleek, comfortable new seats throughout the house, covered in a fabric that absorbs less sound. And the orchestra level will have center aisles: two of them.

The specifics of Phase 2 are still being discussed. Straightening the curved walls on the sides of the theater to improve the acoustics is one proposal. I have been a persistent critic of the decision to install an electronic sound-enhancement system in the theater in 1999. Without commenting officially, Mr. Steel hinted that I and others who shared my opinion should be satisfied before long.

On Mr. Steel’s urging all the carpeting in the auditorium, which, inexplicably, covered almost everything — the floors, the walls, even the handrails — has been removed. This has already enlivened the sound in the house, Mr. Steel said, and demonstrated by clapping his hands and hooting. The sounds he made reverberated throughout the space.

The construction work is actually ahead of schedule, he said, so much so that additional projects were added to Phase 1, including new public restrooms and new dressing rooms for artists.

In his office after the tour Mr. Steel held forth about the coming season and his artistic plans. If New York is to sustain two opera companies, it means that more than ever City Opera will have to distinguish itself from the Metropolitan Opera by honing its mission and affirming its identity.

For the near future, Mr. Steel said, his chief job is to “find the right size for the company, the correct equilibrium.” In its most ambitious seasons the City Opera presented 16 or 17 productions, an impossible number today.

“We want to make sure we present a work we believe in every night,” he said. How many would be ideal in a season? Maybe 10, he said, though at this point he could not say for sure.

Nothing better conveys Mr. Steel’s vision than the decision to present “Esther” as his first staged production. During his tenure as executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, Mr. Steel was an innovative presenter of contemporary music. He was attracted to City Opera partly because of its historic commitment to new work. With the “Esther” revival he continues that tradition. Who should champion this work if not the company that gave it its premiere?

Weisgall, who died in 1997 at 84, was an unapologetic modernist during a period of backlash against complex, atonal compositional idioms. Though his language was gritty and demanding, he had an innate feeling for drama. His tough musical voice exudes theatrical vitality. Based on the biblical story of the Persian queen Esther, who thwarts a plan by the evil prime minister Haman to exterminate the Jews, “Esther” was the last of Weisgall’s 12 operas, and arguably his masterpiece.

The basic elements of the 1993 City Opera production, a simple yet effective staging, are usable. The costumes have been remade, and there will be computer-generated video images to replace the earlier projections. The original director, Christopher Mattaliano, is returning, along with the original star, the soprano Lauren Flanigan, who triumphed in the title role.

Even in this limited season Mr. Steel wanted to present a standard in a new production with a strong point of view. He approached the director Christopher Alden, “whose work I love,” Mr. Steel said, and “it took about three minutes for us to settle on ‘Don Giovanni.’ ”

Singing the title role will be the bass-baritone Daniel Okulitch, who starred last year in the Los Angeles Opera’s American premiere production of “The Fly,” by the composer Howard Shore, best known for his work in film. Mr. Shore’s opera received fairly dismal reviews, but Mr. Okulitch’s courageous portrayal of the obsessed scientist Seth Brundle was warmly praised. His voice, if not large, was elegant and wistful.

Mr. Steel is a huge fan of Emmanuel Chabrier, whose theater works are grossly neglected, he said. So he is reviving a Mark Lamos production of Chabrier’s 1877 comic opera “L’Étoile,” one of the best-kept secrets of the 19th century, a harmonically rich and refined score revered by Debussy and Stravinsky.

Mr. Lamos’s beautifully austere production of Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly,” which won an Emmy Award for the City Opera when it was broadcast on public television last year, is also returning. Finally there will be a revival of Handel’s “Partenope,” a Francisco Negrin production. Over the last 20 years the City Opera has become a go-to place for Handel. Mr. Steel, as passionate about early music as he is about contemporary, intends to maintain this strand of the company’s mission.

Like President Obama, another newcomer to a tough job in a time of crisis, Mr. Steel has been trying to look forward and not dwell on the mistakes of his predecessors. But to concerned admirers of the City Opera, Susan L. Baker, the company’s embattled chairwoman, has much to answer for.

I still maintain that recruiting Gerard Mortier to run City Opera was an intriguing, if risky, idea. Mr. Mortier’s vision of transforming the company into an institution rooted in 20th-century repertory had merit. He wanted a yearly budget of $60 million to carry out that vision. Even though City Opera had never raised much more than $40 million per season, Ms. Baker promised to meet his demands. Once the economy failed, Mr. Mortier hastily withdrew, leaving the company reeling.

That Mr. Steel, an adventurer by nature, has been forced to restart the City Opera modestly may be a saving grace, assuming that the reopening goes as planned. Right now that looks like a pretty good assumption.
410 2009-08-16 I spent countless rapt hours taping my favorite songs off the radio when I was a kid. There were so many tunes, and I had so little money. (And if a motorcycle or a semi went blasting past the house as I taped, then a ballad like “Crimson and Clover” would get some gritty meat on its ethereal bones.)

But even back then, the record companies considered someone like me a sneak thief, a young blackguard. By taping, I was taking money out of their pockets, bread off the table and cocaine from the noses of their artists and executives.

That battle between customer and music company has only intensified since. The listener screams, “Love!” The music executive screams, “Theft!” And the musician — same as it ever was — screams, “Pay me!” Now Greg Kot, a music critic and co-host of a rock ’n’ roll radio talk show, tells us what happened in “Ripped: How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music,” his well-reported book about music in the Internet Age.

“Ripped” ranges from the days when the record companies gnashed their teeth over the growth of home taping, to music publishers’ blunt attacks on sampling in hip-hop, to the life, death and canonization of Napster, to the iPod and beyond. It also examines the constant consolidation — in the music companies, in radio, in concert promotion — that helped lead to the industry’s implosion.

Then there are the abject listeners, dissatisfied with the nonfat vanilla being dispensed on the radio and in the record stores — Backstreet Boys, anyone? But once they discover peer-to-peer file sharing and CD burners, there’s no holding them back. The record companies try their strong-arm tactics and lose. They can’t cope with the guerrilla savvy of kids who have computers and a bottomless thirst for music.
411 2009-08-16 In the two-page prologue to Justin Cartwright’s new novel, “To Heaven by Water,” two brothers, “no longer young,” are sitting by a campfire in the Kalahari Desert. The elder is smoking dope and reciting Gerard Manley Hopkins’s tongue-twisting, syntax-bending sonnet “The Windhover”: “I caught this morning morning’s minion, kingdom of daylight’s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon. . . .” (This can’t be very good weed he’s smoking, since he makes it through all 14 lines without losing his way.) In response, the younger “feels a rushing, unstoppable love” for him, which he expresses by mouthing the conclusion of the Divine Comedy: L’amor che muove il sole e l’altre stelle. (Cartwright goes on to translate for us, though such a familiar line needs Englishing far less than Hopkins does.) The scene ends with Cartwright’s own image of the stars, “implausibly bright, scattered carelessly like lustrous seed across the southern sky.”

If this foretaste of Cartwright’s sensibility sounds like your idea of a good time, don’t let me discourage you. Maybe there are still readers who can be stirred by such stale fancies as that seedlike scatteration of stars — does anybody except a writer in search of a metaphor really see stars that way? — or who feel reverence rather than annoyance when characters begin to intone the classics, or who get the existential willies at hints that a blind and careless life-force might be moving the universe. In fact, there must be such readers, at least in England: the South African-born Cartwright won a Whitbread Award in 1999 for “Leading the Cheers”; other novels — he has written more than a dozen — have been finalists for both the Whitbread and the Booker prizes. But “To Heaven by Water” is a wearisome performance that jerks the reader around with pointless misdirection. Despite its allusiveness — epigraphs from Joyce and the Venerable Bede, quotations from Johnson, Marlowe and Donne as well as Hopkins and Dante — it seems oddly lacking in sophistication, presenting trite dilemmas and shopworn insights as if we’d never encountered them before. Its target audience seems to be the kind of people who don’t get out much.

The central character — the younger brother in the prologue — is a retired television anchor named David Cross, whose wife of many years has died and who has now turned into a gym rat. He has come to realize that TV news is — mehercule! — superficial: “You kept the viewers hooked by announcing the exciting, unmissable story coming next, so that nothing tedious, serious or original should permit the idiot viewer to switch channel before the shark attack, soccer transfer or the celebrity scandal.” Lest we fail to see that David, who once had deeper aspirations, has sold himself out, Cartwright equips him with a convenient back story: he was a hanger-on during the making of Richard Burton’s 1967 film, “Doctor Faustus.” Even more conveniently, Burton — whose name gets dropped with an irksome frequency — “once spoke to him about the Gnostic heresy: we are all potentially divine, but trapped in a material world. Burton seemed to subscribe to this view, and David quickly realized that he did, too.” Hence, to make an overlong story short, David’s pilgrimage to the Kalahari to hang with his Hopkins-quoting brother, who “sees that at the core of everything lies spirituality.”

David’s son, Ed, is also feeling Faust-y: he’s a lawyer who has come to realize that the law is “a shabby business.” His wife, a failed dancer, is having trouble becoming pregnant, and he’s undergoing both an affair and his own crisis of authenticity. “He wonders about the deal he has made with life. Is he a lawyer in his essences? Is he a family man whose only wish is to produce children and . . . make sure they go to good schools . . . and get into Oxford?”

David’s daughter, Lucy, who works for an auction house, has come to realize that her ex-boyfriend is “a creep,” but since she’s still attracted to the guy, she “wonders if she has a self.” Her conversation with David on this subject is a textbook demonstration of the art of sinking in dialogue:

“ ‘Dad, do you think we have a self? . . .’

“He turns to her and looks at her silently for a few moments. When he was on television he was known for his listening, or his appearance of listening.

“ ‘I don’t know,’ he says finally. ‘In my job I had a kind of cultivated self which wasn’t me, really. Why?’

431 2009-08-17 WASHINGTON (AP) — Janel McCarville scored 19 points Sunday, including the victory-clinching 3-point play with 9.1 seconds remaining, in the Liberty’s 60-59 victory against the Washington Mystics.

Shameka Christon scored 14 points for the Liberty (9-15), which lost its two previous meetings with the Mystics this season.

“We threw punches back and forth all game,” said McCarville, who scored the Liberty’s final 7 points. “First quarter was relatively even. We took the second, they took the third. We held their runs. I really felt in the last couple of minutes that we were going to be able to pull it off, and we did.”

Alana Beard scored 11 of her 18 points in the fourth quarter, including a layup with 23.3 seconds left to put the Mystics (12-12) ahead by 59-57.

But on the next possession, the Liberty worked the ball around to McCarville, who tossed in a floater from the lane that bounced around before falling in. She was fouled by Crystal Langhorne and then made the free throw to give the Liberty a 60-59 lead.

“I tried to attack her, get her off her feet or stumble a little bit,” McCarville said. “I was able to draw the contact and hit the ugly shot.”

Beard sent a pass to Lindsey Harding on the left wing, but Harding’s long jumper at the buzzer missed everything.
432 2009-08-17 Eric Zencey is both insightful and correct in all the shortcomings he points out in our calculation of gross domestic product. This is, however, at least one further difficulty inherent in this measure: it also includes economic activity of a purely financial nature.

When loans are made to construct factories, buy equipment or even to build or buy homes, this is a productive transaction. But when these loans are “commoditized” and resold again and again, it is impossible to believe that any notion of “productivity” can be attached to all these subsequent transactions. Yet they are included in the G.D.P.

It is also hard to believe that these transactions don’t add to the cost of the original, productive element of the loan — without increasing the value of the real product. If downstream participants in this seemingly endless dance of avarice all take huge profits from their participation, the money comes from somewhere. Most likely it is subtracted from capital that would otherwise be available for truly productive purposes.
433 2009-08-17 The systematic use of and reliance on the criminal justice system to deal with mental health problems of our youth have been misguided. Not only is this a waste of taxpayer money, but it is also tragic for the youth, families and communities in which they reside. The juveniles who are imprisoned because of mental illness are often without adequate treatment and without hope of recovery. They will be doomed to a life of crime and their victims will suffer. The economic crisis has worsened the situation, as it has resulted in a reduction of support for treatment of mental illness.

Congress should address the policies and revisit laws that result in an extraordinary number of youth with mental health disorders landing in prison. Instead, when possible, home-, family- and community-based care that addresses the underlying disorders should be used.

Greater collaboration is also needed among everyone involved in the lives of youth. Earlier detection of mental health and substance abuse disorders of juveniles in the justice system; increased training for juvenile court, corrections and law enforcement personnel; and expanded services and programs that have been proved to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for juvenile offenders are needed in order to improve the likelihood that juveniles with mental health disorders will get the help they need to become productive members of the community.

As Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. told the American Bar Association during its annual meeting this month in Chicago, while we need to be tough, we also need to be smart on crime.

Your article accurately portrays the devastating consequences of cutting state and community mental health programs. Cutting publicly financed programs does a disservice to the mentally ill, costs more in the long run and worsens human suffering.

A 2004 study showed states with intensive community treatment programs had fewer arrests, jail days and hospitalizations of people with mental illnesses. One state saw an 83 percent reduction in jail days. States and communities that effectively carry out community mental health programs will reduce costs and, more important, help the mentally ill get effective treatment and keep them out of prisons.

Research demonstrates that delinquent youth with mental health issues can be far more effectively helped by home-based and community-based treatment than in correctional institutions. That is why in 2007 the Bloomberg administration began the Juvenile Justice Initiative, which provides treatment at home as an alternative to incarceration for juvenile delinquents.

Treatment for these youth, many of whom have been diagnosed with mental illness, is provided by trained clinicians with small caseloads who help families with obtaining appropriate psychiatric services. This reduces recidivism by 30 to 70 percent (far better than the 90 percent re-arrest rate for youth placed in juvenile prisons), and provides treatment for a fraction of the cost, while more successfully addressing antisocial behavior and teaching caregivers for these youth how to manage the symptoms of their children’s mental illness.

By wrapping services around the youths and their families in the community, therapeutic gains can be sustained after treatment ends.

While thorough in describing the plight of mentally ill youth, your article does not describe emerging innovations.

For example, juvenile mental health courts and legal services lawyers in California have joined together to divert mentally ill youth from detention. These nonadversarial courts offer intensive case management and link youth to community-based mental health services so they can safely return home. The legal services lawyers expand access to critical resources like Medicaid, special education and disability benefits by enforcing existing legal rights to adequate mental health treatment and supports. Providing intensive treatment in the home is cheaper, more effective and more humane than detention.

Juvenile mental health courts are an important innovation to reduce detention of youth with mental illness, but they are not a solution. Only by providing adequate mental health services to every child in America will we end the practice of using juvenile jails to warehouse mentally ill youth.

The writers are, respectively, the deputy director and a legal fellow at the National Center for Youth Law.

The crisis in our juvenile corrections system will only worsen unless we reverse course and aggressively put in place early identification, prevention and effective treatment programs for mental health conditions.

We have a strong research base that shows that these programs can reduce antisocial behaviors and help young people succeed. Yet we fail to invest in these proven approaches. The plight of children in these facilities demands that we change course.

The health reform plans now being debated improve access to prevention programs that can avert the current downward spiral. Effective implementation of the 2008 insurance parity act contained in economic bailout legislation will help assure equitable access to mental health services.

We must change policies that permit mental health services to be the first cut. Continuing on our current path is expensive, ineffective and inhumane.
434 2009-08-17 Intel has decided to appeal the $1.45 billion fine leveled against it by the European Union for engaging in anticompetitive behavior, and it is claiming that the proceedings have violated its human right to due process. Several European companies are also testing the tactic to fend off Europe’s aggressive antitrust regulator.

They argue that in antitrust cases, the European Commission unfairly plays the role of prosecutor, judge and jury — hindering their ability to mount an effective defense. They argue that they should instead be entitled to the due process rights that European human rights law grants in criminal cases to ensure that the accused — usually powerless individuals — are not steamrollered by the overwhelming power of the state.

This concept of powerlessness does not fit Intel, which has annual sales of $38 billion. It especially does not fit considering what the company was found guilty of: giving hidden rebates to computer makers that bought all or virtually all of their chips from Intel, and even paying some to delay or hinder the introduction of products that had microprocessors from its rival, Advanced Micro Devices.

Intel has already hired a squadron of lawyers and is appealing the commission’s decision before the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, Europe’s lower court. If it does not like what that court says, it can appeal its case to the European Court of Justice.

The legal process is all quite similar to what happens when the Federal Trade Commission in this country rules against a company for violating antitrust law. F.T.C. cases are tried before an administrative law judge — an F.T.C. employee. Any appeal must then go to the F.T.C.’s five commissioners. Only after that can a company appeal to the federal Court of Appeals.

American regulators have been far less vigilant than Europe’s. So far they have treated Intel with kid gloves. The F.T.C. opened a formal investigation into Intel’s business only last year, after rulings against the company by Japan and South Korea, and a preliminary decision by the European Union that Intel was abusing its dominant position.
435 2009-08-17 For example, any project that would displace land used for growing food was tossed out for philosophical reasons: the Southern Utes’ belief that energy and food should not compete in a world where people still starve. That eliminated discussion of corn-based ethanol.

And whatever was chosen had to be at least technically feasible, if not immediately profitable.

The 1,400-member tribe also has a long history of herbal medicine use that made growing algae for fuel appealing, Mr. Box said. “It reminded people of herbs that are helpful here, like bear root, which is harvested in the mountains,” he said.

The Colorado State professor, Bryan Willson, who teaches mechanical engineering and is a co-founder of the three-year-old company Solix Biofuels, said working with the Southern Utes on their land afforded his company advantages that would have been impossible in mainstream corporate America. The tribe contributed almost one-third of the $20 million in capital raised by Solix, free use of land and more than $1 million in equipment.

“If you’re going with strict venture capital, they’re looking for a blistering return on capital in three to five years,” Dr. Willson said. “The Utes have a very long economic view. They’re making decisions now for future generations as opposed to the next quarter, and that is just fundamentally different.”

But the tale of any start-up is written between the margins of inspiration and hard-edged reality.

More than 200 other companies are also trying to find a cost-effective, scalable way to achieve the same end — turning algae into vegetable oil fuel, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research center in Golden, Colo. Just last month, Exxon said it planned to throw $600 million into its own algae project, dwarfing Solix’s financial base about fiftyfold. Like most oil-to-fuel efforts, the Solix project focuses on making biodiesel, which can be used in a regular diesel engine.

“This is still a very young industry, with a lot of claims out there that are sometimes difficult to believe,” said Al Darzins, a group manager at the lab’s National Bioenergy Center.

Mr. Darzins said Solix’s model was different from most: the algae is grown in closed bags, lined up vertically in the water tanks, with the intent of increasing yield. But for every hopeful, he said, the crux will be controlling costs.

“Solix has an interesting idea; whether it will work, I don’t know,” Mr. Darzins said. “It’s all going to come down to the economics.”

Solix’s facility project is next to the natural gas processing plant for access to the carbon dioxide waste stream, which will be used to nourish the algae — a kind of biological recycling of carbon dioxide before its discharge into the atmosphere as the vegetable fuel is burned.

The plant also produces waste heat, which could be used to warm the algae beds in winter. In addition, the high desert plateau of southwest Colorado is one of the sunniest spots in the nation, providing solar radiation that accelerates algae growth.

Central to Solix’s business model, Dr. Willson said, is the hope that power plants and other factories now venting carbon dioxide will allow the company to build an algae farm next to their carbon dioxide vent pipes. A plant could sell the oil or biodiesel, and Solix would earn its return by being a part owner-operator, or by licensing the technology.

If Solix can expand its operations to a commercial scale, the Southern Utes will have certain first ownership and operating rights in Solix plants throughout much of the Western United States.

Karl Jacob, the director of public finance in state and local government ratings at the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s, tracks Native American economics and has assigned the Southern Utes’ debt a AAA rating, the agency’s highest. Mr. Jacob said the tribe had proved a canny investor by doing its homework and not moving too fast.

It operates businesses in 14 states, owns office towers and land from Denver to Oceanside, Calif., and controls a company that processes about 1 percent of the nation’s natural gas. But it has only about $69 million in debt according to S.&P. Compared with most companies, that is a tiny debt-to-asset ratio.

“They have always been very prudent,” Mr. Jacob said, “looking out into the next generation.”
436 2009-08-17 HONG KONG — North Korea said Monday that it would open its highly militarized border with South Korea to allow periodic family reunions and group visits by tourists from the South.

The conciliatory move, coming just after the high-profile releases of two American journalists and a South Korean worker detained by the North, seemed likely to ease the growing anxiety on the Korean peninsula.

Tensions had escalated since spring, beginning with the imprisonment of the Americans, the North’s second nuclear test in May, a series of missile tests and North Korea’s refusal to re-engage in six-nation talks over its nuclear weapons.

But the North, in the announcement Monday by its official news agency, also warned the United States and South Korea about their joint military exercises, which the North said were “obviously maneuvers for a war of aggression.” It said an “annihilating” retaliation could be one consequence. Still, that kind of bellicose language is almost standard from the North and was eclipsed by its outreach about the border and tourism.

Analysts have said North Korea is eager to re-establish contacts with Washington and Seoul in hopes of undermining the United Nations’ sanctions over its nuclear program.
437 2009-08-17 The second route to universal coverage leaves the actual delivery of health care in private hands, but the government pays most of the bills. That’s how and, in a more complex fashion, do it. It’s also a system familiar to most Americans, since even those of us not yet on have parents and relatives who are.

Again, you hear a lot of horror stories about such systems, most of them false. French health care is excellent. Canadians with chronic conditions are more satisfied with their system than their U.S. counterparts. And Medicare is highly popular, as evidenced by the tendency of town-hall protesters to demand that the government keep its hands off the program.

Finally, the third route to universal coverage relies on private companies, using a combination of regulation and subsidies to ensure that everyone is covered. Switzerland offers the clearest example: everyone is required to buy insurance, insurers can’t discriminate based on medical history or pre-existing conditions, and lower-income citizens get government help in paying for their policies.

In this country, the Massachusetts health reform more or less follows the Swiss model; costs are running higher than expected, but the reform has greatly reduced the number of uninsured. And the most common form of in America, employment-based coverage, actually has some “Swiss” aspects: to avoid making benefits taxable, employers have to follow rules that effectively rule out discrimination based on medical history and subsidize care for lower-wage workers.

So where does Obamacare fit into all this? Basically, it’s a plan to Swissify America, using regulation and subsidies to ensure universal coverage.

If we were starting from scratch we probably wouldn’t have chosen this route. True “socialized medicine” would undoubtedly cost less, and a straightforward extension of Medicare-type coverage to all Americans would probably be cheaper than a Swiss-style system. That’s why I and others believe that a true public option competing with private insurers is extremely important: otherwise, rising costs could all too easily undermine the whole effort.

But a Swiss-style system of universal coverage would be a vast improvement on what we have now. And we already know that such systems work.

So we can do this. At this point, all that stands in the way of universal health care in America are the greed of the medical-industrial complex, the lies of the right-wing propaganda machine, and the gullibility of voters who believe those lies.

Correction: In Friday’s column I mistakenly asserted that Senator was responsible for a provision in a House bill that would allow Medicare to pay for end-of-life counseling. In fact, he is responsible for a provision in a Senate bill that would allow a different, newly created government program to pay for such counseling.
438 2009-08-17 When buying products whose selling point is richness or weight, consumers like to see the product image at the bottom or the right of the packaging, according to a study to be published in December in The Journal of Marketing.

By contrast, products that are supposed to be healthy or light — like low-calorie cookies or hand-held video cameras — do better with images at the top of the packaging, or on the left.

These rules, which apparently spring from the way the human eye approaches an image, are not part of the conventional wisdom of marketing.

“When we scoured the trade literature, we didn’t find any evidence of it,” said Barbara Kahn, one of the study’s two authors, who is the dean of the business school at the University of Miami.

Nonetheless, as the researchers examined 279 cracker and cookie packages, they found that marketers seemed to be observing the rules unconsciously, especially when packaging cookies. Cookies branded as being healthy were almost four times as likely as other cookies to have the product image in a “light” location.

“They obviously have managerial intuition, and they obviously product test, so these things kept coming out in testing as the preferred product,” Professor Kahn said. ALEX MINDLIN
439 2009-08-17 Television analysts and some competitors said Mr. Imus, who reportedly reaches millions of radio listeners, would act as a one-man sampling strategy for Fox Business, motivating new viewers to turn on the sometimes hard-to-find network for the first time. In an interview last week about ratings, the executive vice president for the network, Kevin Magee, suggested that was exactly what it needed.

“We have to teach people we exist, and then convince them to find us,” Mr. Magee said. “And then once they do those two things, they have to watch us.”

Fox Business has been closely watched in the media world because when it made its debut in October 2007 it took aim squarely at CNBC, the dominant business news network and part of NBC Universal.

So far the upstart’s audience is measly. Nielsen Media Research estimates that in June, Fox Business was watched by an average of 21,000 people from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., the hours Fox deems its “business day.” That month, CNBC had an average audience about 11 times that size. The country’s other business channel, Bloomberg, is not rated by Nielsen.

News Corporation executives have always cautioned that, as Mr. Magee put it last week, “it’s going to take time” to establish its financial offering as a competitor. Fox Business is not yet a full-service ratings client.

Distribution is one of the key hurdles. Fox Business is viewable in almost 50 million households, a far cry from CNBC’s 97 million. In most of those households, Fox Business is on the digital tier, high on the dial. “People who are desperate to find us have trouble finding us,” Mr. Magee said.

For instance, the network is on Channel 106 in Washington, Channel 144 in St. Louis and Channel 223 in Los Angeles. New York City, the country’s most important financial market, is the only exception, as Fox Business has a prime spot, Channel 43, on the analog portion of Time Warner Cable.

According to people close to the Fox talks, who requested anonymity because the deal is incomplete and could fall apart, “Imus in the Morning” could be shown from 6 to 9 a.m. on Fox Business. Mr. Imus would displace the network’s current morning show, “Money for Breakfast,” which is hosted by Alexis Glick, who is also a vice president at the channel.

Fox doesn’t have to worry much about irritating its current viewers with a change: its audience from 6 to 9 a.m. is too small to be reported, Nielsen said. Nielsen defines the minimum threshold as being one-tenth of one percent of United States households with TV sets. Fox said that other parts of the day have surpassed the minimum threshold on multiple occasions this summer.

The talks with Mr. Imus would have been inconceivable little more than two years ago, when he was fired from CBS Radio after he was widely criticized for joking about the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed hos” on the air. MSNBC, which like CNBC is a unit of NBC Universal, also canceled its simulcast of the show, saying that Mr. Imus “went so far over the line that it was time.”

About six months later, he was hired by Citadel Broadcasting to resume his radio talk show.

Mr. Imus would add a jolt of star power to Fox Business, but it is hard to tell how much. His simulcast by RFD-TV, short for Rural Free Delivery, has reached a daily average of 49,000 viewers year-to-date, according to Nielsen. RFD is available in about 40 million homes.

But RFD clearly lacks the promotional abilities of Fox. It may also lack the ability to fully compensate him. The New York Daily News said last week that RFD owes Mr. Imus “multiple millions of dollars in back pay.” Patrick Gottsch, the founder of RFD, did not respond to interview requests, and his lawyer said he had declined to comment.

Mr. Imus also declined to comment. His spokesman said “there are no financial issues” between Mr. Imus and RFD.

When reports of the talks with Mr. Imus surfaced this month, some people inside and outside Fox questioned whether the network would be ceding financial news turf during critical morning hours. The network would have to proceed with caution because its contracts with cable operators specify that it is a business-oriented channel.

But people close to the talks said that radio’s format lent itself to flexibility, as it includes local breaks for news and commercials that could be filled by business news updates. Fox would also presumably include business graphics on the screen.

Mr. Imus has had several Fox Business hosts as guests on his radio show in recent weeks, including Ms. Glick and Neil Cavuto. In between comments about his ongoing cancer treatments and his ranch for children, the radio host has talked repeatedly about the greed of “Wall Street crooks.”

Mr. Imus and Roger Ailes, the Fox News chief, have known each other for decades.

“This is a characteristically genius move for Roger Ailes,” said Bob Sherman, a friend of Mr. Imus’s and one of his former bosses. “He can now bank the network’s marketing dollars.”

466 2009-08-18 The Census Bureau said that Mormon missionaries from Utah — however visible they are all over the world in their white shirts and ties — would be left out of the 2010 census. In 2000, more than 11,000 foreign missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were not counted, when the state fell 857 people short of qualifying for a fourth seat in the House of Representatives. The census counts military personal and federal employees living abroad, but no other citizens. Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat, recently sponsored an amendment to a State Department budget bill that would require the Census Bureau to study whether passport records could be used to count Americans living abroad.
467 2009-08-18 “Why did the turtle cross the road?” the report asked. “To get to the other side of a stimulus project.”

But local advocates have sought the passage there for years, monitoring the steady stream of turtle deaths, building the temporary fence that protects turtles there now and mounting a large grass-roots campaign that eventually won state support for a more permanent “eco-passage.”

Of course, none of these projects are likely to stimulate much in the way of new, long-term economic activity, a goal of the federal stimulus plan, once the construction crews decamp. But neither will many of the street repaving jobs that are getting the bulk of the highway money in the stimulus bill, however badly they may be needed.

One of the main purposes of the stimulus is to use government spending to prop up the economy in the short term by offsetting the decline in private-sector spending. But in doing so, the Obama administration has given rise to a debate that goes back many decades.

“The divide hasn’t really changed since the Depression,” said Nick Taylor, an author who chronicled the fierce debates of the New Deal era over boondoggles in “American-Made: The Enduring Legacy of the W.P.A.” (Bantam, 2008). Mr. Taylor said many of the projects that were mocked back then as boondoggles went on to have long and productive lives. But he added that there were some truly wasteful projects back then as well, like a lake dug at a spot in that turned out not to have a water source.

Before it became a bad word, “boondoggle” was an innocent, humble craft. It was the who claimed for coining the word, to refer to the plaited leather lanyards that they made and wore around their necks.

That all changed on April 3, 1935, at a hearing in on how New Deal relief money was being spent. A crafts teacher reluctantly testified that he was paid to show the jobless how to make “boon doggles.” The outcry was swift. “$3,187,000 Relief is Spent to Teach Jobless to Play,” trumpeted a front-page headline the next day in . “ ‘Boon Doggles’ Made.”

A new, more sinister meaning was born, and the word came to signify government make-work, later referring to wasteful government projects in general. Critics used it to criticize scores of projects, but President took a longer view. “If we can boondoggle ourselves out of this Depression,” Roosevelt said, “that word is going to be enshrined in the hearts of the American people for years to come.”

The Depression ended, but the word has not exactly been enshrined in the hearts of the people. Now, as a new administration in a new century tries to pump $787 billion into the economy with a combination of spending and cuts, questions about the usefulness of projects are raging as loudly as ever, even as some economists begin to credit the stimulus with averting an even worse downturn.

Boondoggle- was a guiding principle in the writing of the bill. After a water park in Florida was mocked for seeking stimulus money while the bill was being drafted, a provision was added barring states and local governments from using their money to build swimming pools. (Swimming pools may sound frivolous, but they are also popular: the government built hundreds of them during the New Deal, including 11 of New York City’s biggest, grandest pools, many of which are still in use.)

Another provision barred state and local governments from spending their stimulus money on zoos, which were another big recipient of New Deal money. (The National Zoological in Washington, which is part of the , is apparently exempt: it is getting $11.4 million from the stimulus for repairs and safety projects.)

Robert D. Leighninger Jr., a sociologist who wrote “Long-Range Public Investment: The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal” ( University Press, 2007), recounted the story of a official in who went off in search of boondoggles, and discovered that the towns he visited seemed to like their own projects but questioned those of their neighbors.

“I’ve been hunting all over the state for one, but everywhere I go I’m told it’s in the next county,” the official was quoted as saying in a 1936 newspaper article. “So far I haven’t been able to catch up with a real, live one.”
468 2009-08-18 The mayor of Anchorage on Monday vetoed a ban against discrimination based on sexual orientation, saying it was unclear that such discrimination existed.

The mayor, Dan Sullivan, a Republican who took office on July 1, added that “the vast majority of those who communicated their position on the ordinance are in opposition.”

The ordinance, which would have prohibited such discrimination in employment, housing, education and other areas, was approved by the Anchorage Assembly last week on a 7-to-4 vote. Eight votes are necessary to override a mayoral veto.

The Assembly’s approval of the ordinance, a topic of impassioned public debate at its meetings for much of the summer, followed decades of efforts to pass similar measures. Mr. Sullivan’s father, George Sullivan, who also served as mayor, vetoed an initial proposal in 1976. Then, as now, the ordinance met with vocal opposition among Christian conservatives.

“This ordinance was going to force small-business owners particularly to accommodate people who choose a certain lifestyle,” said the Rev. Jerry Prevo, pastor of the Anchorage Baptist Temple and a leader of the measure’s opponents.

“Once you give special rights to homosexuals,” Mr. Prevo said, “then the next step is you legalize homosexual marriage and so forth.”
469 2009-08-18 As Wall Street returns to profitability, it is eagerly returning to business as usual. Most notably it is preparing to pay enormous bonuses, like those that encouraged the sort of risk taking that set off the financial crisis.

That point was underscored in an article in The Times on Sunday by Gretchen Morgenson, which described a new study by James F. Reda & Associates, an independent compensation consultant in New York.

The study used proxy filings to analyze the pay plans at 191 of the nation’s largest companies in the first half of 2009. Instead of seeing a greater reliance on long-term incentive programs, the report found that most companies have actually made short-term incentive pay a bigger part of the compensation package.

The report covered 21 financial firms. Three, including Goldman Sachs, had reported no changes to their pay policies. JPMorgan Chase, in contrast, had put more conditions on pay, generally allowing the bank to attach more performance benchmarks and to impose a longer wait before pay is awarded.

Ideally, banks would be free to compensate employees as they saw fit. But that must be accompanied by reforms that ensure that banks can no longer profit from primarily speculative activities or other excessively risky transactions — including regulating the opaque derivatives markets and imposing limits on the use of borrowed money to increase profits.

The Obama administration unveiled a broad reform plan in June. But Congress has yet to tackle the most far-reaching issues. Meanwhile, despite the recent evidence to the contrary, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told The Wall Street Journal last week that he did not think the financial system was reverting to past practice, adding, “and we won’t let that happen.”
470 2009-08-18 Rex Ryan has injected a badly needed dose of energy and humor into the Jets, but his players are not giving him much help getting his defense off the ground. On Monday, the N.F.L. announced that defensive end Shaun Ellis would be suspended for the season opener and fined $100,000 because of his arrest last November for marijuana possession, speeding and driving without insurance.

For a team that hopes to play Ravens-style football — low-scoring games with a great defense and a tough running game limiting the need for a rookie quarterback to win the game with his arm (assuming Mark Sanchez gets the starting job) — the suspension was not good news. Especially because linebacker Calvin Pace will miss the first four games for violating the league’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.

Ellis’s suspension was not a surprise because Ellis was not disciplined last year, although Ryan said recently that he believed Ellis would play until informed otherwise. So much for that. The Jets will face the Houston Texans in their opener. If there is a sliver of good news, it is that Ellis will be back in time to chase Tom Brady around in Week 2 when the Jets play New England.

“It hurts,” Ellis said. “It’s a situation that happened last year. For it to carry on into this year, it’s kind of tough. I just wish I would have been able to have dealt with it last year. This year is just going into things fresh with that behind me. Yes, I’m going to miss being out there, but I have confidence in the New York Jets that they will get the job done.”

TROUBLE WITH THE RAIDERS? Oakland Coach Tom Cable declined to comment about reports he punched the defensive assistant Randy Hanson in the jaw and caused injuries that required treatment at a hospital earlier this month.

According to AOL Fanhouse, Cable hit Hanson on Aug. 5 for unknown reasons. A report filed with the Napa Police Department describes an unnamed 41-year-old assistant coach being treated at the Queen of the Valley Hospital for a jaw injury, which the victim said was caused by an unidentified member of the Raiders coaching staff.
471 2009-08-18 A former broker at the Credit Suisse Group, Eric Butler, was convicted on Monday of fraudulently selling millions of dollars in subprime securities to corporate clients.

Mr. Butler was found guilty on federal charges on all three counts after two hours of jury deliberations.

A co-defendant, Julian Tzolov, 36, had been a fugitive for three months on a $3 million bond, but was captured by authorities in Spain and returned to New York. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud on July 22. He testified as a prosecution witness during the three-week trial.

Mr. Butler, 37, and Mr. Tzolov were indicted last year, charged with conducting what prosecutors said was an illegal scheme in which they had falsely told clients their products were backed by federally guaranteed student loans and were a safe alternative to bank deposits. The products were actually linked to auction-rate securities.

John Nowak, an assistant United States attorney, told jurors in closing arguments that the two ran a high-stakes bait and switch, promising clients one product and delivering another to get higher commissions. Mr. Butler faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.
472 2009-08-18 More than one in 10 deaths in immigration detention in the last six years have been overlooked and were omitted from an official list of detainee fatalities issued to Congress in March, the Obama administration said Monday.

The administration added 10 previously unreported deaths to the official roster and disclosed an 11th, which occurred Friday: that of Huluf Guangule Negusse, a 24-year-old Ethiopian. Mr. Negusse died from the effects of an Aug. 3 suicide attempt in the Wakulla County correctional facility near Tallahassee, Fla.

What Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials call “the death roster” stands at 104 since October 2003, up from the 90 that were on the list the agency gave to Congress this spring.

The latest search for records began late last month, officials said, when Freedom of Information litigation by the American Civil Liberties Union uncovered one of the 10 deaths that had gone unreported  that of Felix Franklin Rodriguez-Torres, 36, an Ecuadorean who settled in New York and died of testicular cancer on Jan. 18, 2007, after being detained two months at an immigration jail run for profit by the Corrections Corporation of America in Eloy, Ariz.

On Saturday, after inquiries about that case by The New York Times, the new chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, issued a directive for field offices to make sure that other deaths had not been overlooked, a spokesman said.

David Shapiro, staff lawyer with the A.C.L.U. National Prison Project, said: “Today’s announcement is a tragic confirmation of our worst fears. Our nation’s immigration detention system has been plagued by a total lack of transparency and accountability, and even with today’s announcement there is no way we can be fully confident that there are not still more deaths that somehow have gone unaccounted for.”

Few details of the newly disclosed deaths were provided, but other than Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Negusse and a Mexican national, all who died were Cuban nationals whose deaths occurred from 2004 to 2006. Mr. Negusse died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, officials said, after he was removed from life support on the recommendation of a medical proxy.

The existence of undisclosed detention fatalities first came to light this spring, when The Times reported the case of Tanveer Ahmad, 43, a Pakistani New Yorker who had been held in a New Jersey immigration jail where a fellow detainee said that Mr. Ahmad’s symptoms of a heart attack had gone untreated until too late.

The difficulty of confirming Mr. Ahmad’s very existence showed that deaths could fall between the cracks in immigration detention, the hundreds of county jails, for-profit prisons and federal detention centers where about 400,000 people a year are held while the government tries to deport them. Mr. Ahmad turned out to be a longtime New York cabby who had overstayed a visa.

In April, an agency spokeswoman, Kelly Nantel, acknowledged that Mr. Ahmad’s death had been overlooked, but added, “We believe we have accounted for every single detainee death.”

Yet in records turned over to the A.C.L.U. in late July, lawyers for the group said they were surprised to find yet another death that was not on the list obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act and published last year on its Web site.

Previously, the only public documentation of such deaths had been pieced together by relatives of the dead and their advocates; as recently as 2007, they were aware of about 20 cases. Eventually the immigration enforcement agency revealed that there had been 62 detention deaths since 2004 but declined to provide names, dates, locations or causes until compelled to do so under the Freedom of Information Act.

This month, the Obama administration announced a plan to revamp the detention system.
473 2009-08-18 A prisoners’ rights group said Monday that it had begun legal action to force the British government to reveal the identities of two men detained by British troops in Iraq and transferred to American custody in Afghanistan. The group, Reprieve, said it wanted the Ministry of Defense to disclose information about the men, who were detained in 2004 and are held today at Bagram Air Base near Kabul. Britain, which has acknowledged handing the men over, says the United States has identified them as members of the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Reprieve hopes to pursue lawsuits on their behalf.
474 2009-08-18 A week after Westchester County entered into a settlement that will require creating 750 moderately priced homes in overwhelmingly white suburbs and marketing them aggressively to black and Hispanic families, the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, made a rare and emotional appearance before the County Legislature to plead that it ratify the agreement.

“Do not make us the symbol of racism,” he told the Board of Legislators’ budget committee on Monday morning.

The settlement appeared headed for approval after the committee endorsed it without a dissenting vote. Michael B. Kaplowitz, vice chairman of the 17-person board, said the members had misgivings about a settlement that would cost more than $50 million, but believed they had no choice because penalties for not approving it would amount to $180 million.

Mr. Spano pointed out that the county had already voluntarily built 1,700 units of so-called affordable housing and had plans to build a total of 7,684 units. Much of that new housing has been assigned in a system that gave preference to volunteer firefighters, teachers and other municipal workers, who often mirror the racial makeup of their communities.

“Never has there been a decrease in property values in what we have built,” Mr. Spano said, addressing criticism that affordable housing ruins neighborhoods.
475 2009-08-18 Swedbank, one of the largest Nordic lenders, announced Monday that it was issuing preferred stock to raise about 15 billion kronor ($2.1 billion) as loan losses continue in the eastern Baltic.

“The aim is to strengthen our competitive position in our four home markets; that is, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,” Michael Wolf, chief executive of the bank, said in a conference call.

Mr. Wolf said that the bank would be better able to support its main clients with the infusion and that the funds would help Swedbank return to independence. It currently depends upon a guarantee from the Swedish government to borrow money from other banks.

Almost half of the offering was taken up by existing shareholders, with the rest guaranteed by its underwriters, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and the Credit Suisse Group.

The capital increase, Mr. Wolf said, “means we have full control over our own fate, and can put capital where the need is greatest and where it can generate the most profit.”
476 2009-08-18 BEIJING (AP) — China will appeal a World Trade Organization ruling that ordered it to ease restrictions on imports of movies, music and books in a case brought by the United States, a commerce ministry spokesman said Monday.

“We are actively preparing the documents to appeal,” the spokesman, Yao Jian, said at a news conference. He gave no details of the grounds for appeal, but the government last week denied that had it obstructed imports.

The appeal will be filed within two months in line with W.T.O. rules, Mr. Yao said.

A world trade panel concluded last week that Beijing was violating its free-trade commitments by forcing imported media products to be routed through Chinese state-owned companies. It said Beijing should allow foreign companies to import and distribute master copies of books, magazines and newspapers and to receive the same conditions and charges as Chinese companies for distributing reading materials.

“Chinese cultural products have a big deficit in global trade, and their competitiveness is low,” Mr. Yao said. “So we took measures that fit the Chinese economy and historical cultural tradition.”

The Communist government in China views its control over content of movies, music, books and other media as a tool to protect its political power. The government is trying to build up China’s state-owned film studios and other media to promote the party’s views at home and abroad.

The dispute is one of a series between the United States and China over access to each other’s markets for goods ranging from tires to poultry. The United States is the world’s biggest exporter of movies, pop music and other cultural goods and sees increased sales as a way to narrow its multibillion-dollar trade deficit with China.
477 2009-08-18 Romania, which has been lauded as a poor country that successfully tackled its AIDS epidemic, is facing shortages of antiretroviral drugs because of the global recession, according to local media reports and people working there.

AIDS patients have appealed to President Traian Basescu to restore their medications, the newspaper Romania Libera reported.

The AIDS epidemic in Romania is unusual. Only about 12,000 people have the virus, of whom about 9,000 are on treatment — many of them teenagers and young adults infected by blood transfusions and dirty needles when they were babies in the late 1980s.

Orphanage populations had swelled as President Nicolae Ceausescu, trying to drive up birth rates, outlawed birth control and abortion. With little money for food, vitamins or supplies, squalid state orphanages gave “micro-transfusions” of adult blood from paid donors as a nutritional supplement, and nurses reused vaccination needles.

Mr. Ceacescu was overthrown and executed in 1989, and the orphanages began emptying, but hundreds of children died in the next few years. In 2001, drug prices fell sharply, and by 2004, with help from foreign donors, the government declared that it had virtually every AIDS patient on treatment, with subsidies for food and transportation. Now many patients are down to only a few days’ worth of pills, local news media reports say.

“Our wonderful doctors have worked so hard to keep these kids alive for so long, it would be tragic if they’re endangered by a shortage of antiretrovirals,” said Mary Veal, an American who has worked for years with AIDS patients in Romanian hospitals.
478 2009-08-18 WOODRIDGE, Ill. — The orientation camp for the United States men’s Olympic team opened on a joyless note Monday in this Chicago suburb, with the Blackhawks star Patrick Kane making his first public comments since his Aug. 9 arrest in Buffalo after what the police said was an altercation with a cab driver. Kane apologized for putting himself, and his team, in a tough situation, but said he could not discuss the incident in detail.

“I’ve been very lucky to achieve every kid’s dream of playing in the National Hockey League, let alone for a great organization like the Chicago Blackhawks,” a grim-faced Kane said. “Now I also have a chance to play for my country, a dream come true for myself and also my family.”

Kane was flanked by Brian Burke, the Olympic team’s general manager, and Stan Bowman, the Blackhawks’ general manager, as he addressed a room full of reporters. He said he could not discuss details of the incident because of his legal proceedings.

“Because I put myself in the wrong place at the wrong time, I’ve caused a lot of pain for my family, my hometown of Buffalo, the city of Chicago, the Chicago Blackhawks and obviously the great fans we have here in Chicago,” Kane said. “And for that part I sincerely apologize. Now it’s time for me to move forward. I’m excited to get back to the ice and represent the Chicago Blackhawks and the United States Olympic hockey team.”

Kane spoke at the start of the orientation camp, the first step in selecting the 23-player Olympic team. The team’s core will come from the 34 players invited here, although Burke said another 40 players would be put on the World Anti-Doping Agency drug-testing regimen and could be selected when the roster is announced, probably in late December.
479 2009-08-18 ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. — Over two decades, the Bard Music Festival has managed more than its fair share of ambitious feats in its immersive annual examinations of classical music’s major composers. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of this invaluable series, Leon Botstein, the conductor and Bard College president, chose to tackle Wagner — a riskier proposition than it might first appear.

On the simplest level, Wagner worked almost exclusively in opera, yet the festival includes no complete operas, by him or anyone else. (Meyerbeer’s “Huguenots,” staged at Bard earlier this month, was meant to be a prelude to the festival proper.)

A more substantial challenge arises from the fact that 126 years after his death, Wagner remains a polarizing figure because of his radical nationalism and anti-Semitism. That serious issue, to be addressed in a panel discussion on Sunday morning, served as just one strand among many examined during an opening weekend that pondered a different conundrum: What were the early steps and formative influences that led to Wagner becoming so universally influential?

In a preconcert lecture on Friday night, Mr. Botstein asserted that Wagner’s inspiration reached beyond music to film, literature and even architecture because of his notions of structure and pacing. The concert, presented by the American Symphony Orchestra in Bard’s elegant 826-seat Sosnoff Theater, showed that nothing among Wagner’s early works indicated that he was a likely candidate for changing the world.

The overture to “Rienzi” was part of a capable adoption of Meyerbeer’s grand-opera style. An aria from “Die Feen” recalled Beethoven’s “Fidelio,” especially in the soprano Christine Goerke’s impassioned account. For “Das Liebesverbot,” Wagner mimicked the bel-canto style of Bellini, a debt clearly discernible in an aria sung by the charismatic bass-baritone Daniel Mobbs.

The concert’s second half was the aesthetic equivalent of whiplash: Wagner’s Symphony in C, a youthful work that aimlessly frittered with Beethovenian motifs, was followed by the Prelude and Liebestod from “Tristan und Isolde,” with ravishing singing from Ms. Goerke.
480 2009-08-18 In 2005, the Hastings Center, a research organization in Garrison, N.Y., that deals with ethical issues in health and medicine, produced a report called “Improving End of Life Care: Why Has It Been So Difficult?”

“Despite 30 years of litigation, laws and efforts by a range of groups to improve treatment for those near death,” the report’s summary says, “too many Americans still receive poor care at life’s end and are dying ‘bad’ deaths without adequate palliative care or dignity.”

Dr. Joanne Lynn, a geriatrician in the Community Health Administration of the Department of Health in Washington, D.C., noted in the report that the health care system in the United States had made it possible “to live for years ‘in the valley of the shadow of death.’ ” Unfortunately, she added, there are no strong industry interests to advocate for good care at the end of life.

As a hospitalist, Dr. Gordon has had many opportunities to observe the agonies of a bad death — one in which patients failed to leave adequate instructions for how they should be treated when therapy for their disease is no longer helping.

The questions are critical, even if some people find them difficult to contemplate. Should a feeding tube be installed when the patient can no longer be nourished by mouth? Should a ventilator be attached when breathing independently becomes difficult? If the patient has severe dementia, should antibiotics be used if pneumonia develops? Should cardiopulmonary resuscitation be attempted if the heart stops beating?

Or should the patient receive just comfort care — treatment for pain, nausea, anxiety, depression and other debilitating symptoms — and be allowed to die a natural death?

Only about one-third of Americans have completed any kind of advance directive to guide their families and physicians when they cannot speak for themselves. Of the advance directives that have been executed, many, if not most, are too vague to be truly useful.

Lacking guidance from patients and families, physicians who know better too often end up providing costly life support for the terminally ill even though there is no hope for an improved quality of life.

Furthermore, Dr. Gordon noted in an interview, most people, who are schooled primarily by TV dramas, vastly overestimate the chances of survival after resuscitation. While on television more than 60 percent survive after CPR, in real life only 5 to 10 percent of patients over 70 survive resuscitation in a hospital.

Even doctors commonly overestimate the success of CPR, Dr. Gordon said. Only a third know accurate survival rates.

Physicians also still commonly ignore the requests of patients or designated patient representatives to avoid high-tech life support. A friend was recently intimidated by a doctor who wanted to insert a feeding tube into her terminally ill father, who had suffered a stroke.

“I don’t believe in starving my patients,” the doctor said when she told him her father would not want such intervention. And so the feeding tube was inserted, and the patient, who requires 24-hour care, continues to make frequent trips to the hospital with infections and other complications.

As the Hasting Center report stated, “Physicians unwilling to give up and indifferent to patient desires are still with us.”

The system is not saving lives, Dr. Gordon says. “We’re torturing patients by prolonging their deaths. And the cost to society is astronomical.”

He cited a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1993. It found that about 30 percent of Medicare dollars are spent during the last year of life, and half of that is spent during the last 60 days. In 2009 dollars, Dr. Gordon calculated, that amounts to $70 billion a year, much of it spent on futile care that prolongs suffering.

This “incredibly expensive end-of-life care” detracts from the health care system’s ability to finance preventive care, Dr. Charles A. Bush, the medical director of Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital at the Ohio State University, told me.

In addition to their high cost, common life-prolonging interventions can result in a host of debilitating or costly complications, like repeated infections, mental deterioration, serious drug reactions and persistent pain and discomfort. That doesn’t even include the distress experienced by family members tending to loved ones hooked up to myriad tubes and devices.

Sometimes, out of guilt or misunderstanding, family members insist that “everything that can be done should be done” to keep their dying relatives alive as long as possible. But as the main character in Dr. Gordon’s book puts it, “I wish more people knew the misery of ‘everything.’ ”

Too many families equate the failure to provide life support with “killing” the patient, Dr. Gordon has found, But, he insists, doctors who eliminate high-tech interventions are not killing patients. Nor does he advocate physician-assisted suicide.

Rather, he wrote: “We keep people comfortable and let nature take its course. Given the opportunity, most people would not choose a prolonged, painful death. Instead, they would choose a natural, dignified death.”

To help people make sound health care decisions and get the care they would want for themselves or their family members as life draws to a close, the National Institute on Aging has produced a comprehensive 68-page booklet, “End-of-Life: Helping With Comfort and Care.” Individual free copies can be obtained through the institute’s Web site, www.nia.nih.gov, or by calling 800-222-2225.
481 2009-08-18 Childhood cancer survivors are at much greater risk of developing diabetes than their siblings, especially if their treatment involved radiation of the abdomen or total body, a new study reports.

At highest risk were adults who survived acute myeloid leukemia after total body irradiation, done in conjunction with a bone marrow transplant, the study found. Those survivors were almost 24 times as likely as their siblings to develop Type 2 diabetes as adults. Children with this form of leukemia who did not undergo total body irradiation were three times as likely as their siblings to develop diabetes.

Cancer survivors who had been treated with radiation to the abdomen were also at higher risk for diabetes, with neuroblastoma survivors at 9.2 times greater risk, and survivors of both Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Wilms’ tumor, a type of kidney cancer, at 2.7 times greater risk.

Many of the survivors are not obese, but radiation might have altered the way they deposit fat and contribute to their risk, said Dr. Kevin C. Oeffinger, director the Program for Adult Survivors of Pediatric Cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and senior author of the study. The findings appeared in The Archives of Internal Medicine.

Dr. Oeffinger suggested cancer survivors watch their diets and get plenty of physical activity.
482 2009-08-18 Mr. Abdullah, the candidate for the largest opposition bloc, the National Front, and Mr. Ghani, a former finance minister, say the first step must be a grass-roots approach through community and tribal councils to address the grievances of people who have taken up arms against the government. “If you lose the people, you lose the war,” Mr. Abdullah said in an interview.

Mr. Ghani advocates a cease-fire as the next step, with political negotiations only later. “It’s not going to be easy,” he told journalists at a briefing. “It is going to be quite complex and quite tough, but we need to create the conditions of confidence.”

Among those urging a wide-reaching political solution is the head of the mission in Afghanistan, Kai Eide. A peace process, or reconciliation as he prefers to call it, has to be a top priority of any new government, as does improving relations with , which has long backed the Taliban, he said.

The groundwork for that process needs to be laid through the winter, he says, in order to forestall another season of fighting next spring. He also says that the effort has to be broader than the reconciliation and reintegration of local commanders envisaged by the military.

“You have different views — those who believe you can do it locally, from province to province, district to district,” he said. “I don’t think that is the case, I think you have to have a wider process.”

But the United States and want to negotiate from a position of strength, diplomats and military officials said. “Reconciliation is important, but not now,” said one Western diplomat in Kabul, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not going to happen until the insurgency is weaker and the government is stronger.”

Thomas Ruttig, co-director of Afghanistan Analysts Network, an independent policy research group, proposed in a recent report multilayered contacts or talks with different elements of the insurgency. He also advocated a long-term reconciliation process across the country to address the alienation from the government of many groups who are tempted to join the Taliban, and to heal the wounds of 30 years of war.

The Obama administration has done little publicly to push the issue forward, offering to talk to moderate members of the Taliban but drawing the line at those linked to .

“We and our Afghan allies stand ready to welcome anyone supporting the Taliban who renounces Al Qaeda, lays down their arms, and is willing to participate in the free and open society that is enshrined in the Afghan Constitution,” Secretary of State said in a speech last month.

Yet critics say that essentially demanding that the Taliban surrender will not produce results.

The few senior members of the Taliban who have come over to the government warn that there is so much distrust of the government and foreign forces that it is deterring even low-level members of the Taliban. They have watched the poor treatment of tribal leaders and elders by the government and foreign forces.

Abdul Wahid Baghrani, an important tribal leader from Helmand Province who went over to the government in 2005 under its reconciliation program, negotiated the surrender of the Taliban in 2001 with Mr. Karzai. Now he lives in a house in western Kabul but is largely ignored by the government, despite the enormous influence he could exercise.

Three months ago his eldest son, Zia ul-Haq, 32, was killed, along with his wife and driver, when British helicopters swooped in on their car as they were traveling in Helmand. Two Western officials confirmed the shooting but said it was a mistake. The forces were trying to apprehend a high-level Taliban target, they said.

“My son was not an armed Talib, he was a religious Talib,” he said. The word Talib means religious student. “From any legal standpoint it is not permitted to fire on a civilian car.

“This is not just about my son,” he said. “Every day we are losing hundreds of people, and I care about them as much as I care for my son.”

Despite the deaths, he has remained in Kabul and still advocates peace negotiations.

He said it was wrong to consider the Taliban leadership, or the leader Mullah , as irreconcilable. “It is not the opinion of people who know him and work with him,” he said.

“Of course it is possible to make peace with the Taliban — they are Afghans,” he said. “The reason they are fighting is because they are not getting the opportunity to make peace.”
483 2009-08-18 Older people who exercise seem to be at lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease, as are those who eat a Mediterranean-style diet. Now, a new study has found that the effects of the two lifestyle behaviors are independent of one another  and together, they add up.

The Columbia University study followed a diverse group of 1,880 septuagenarian New Yorkers, assessing their diets and levels of physical activity, and screening them periodically for Alzheimer’s disease. After an average of five years, 282 cases of Alzheimer’s were diagnosed.

Those who followed the healthiest diets were 40 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than those with the worst diets, and those who got the most exercise were 37 percent less likely to develop the disease than those who got none. The greatest benefits occurred in those who both ate healthfully and remained active. Participants who scored in the top third for both diet and exercise were 59 percent less likely to receive an Alzheimer’s diagnosis than those in the lowest third.

“It’s a bigger effect, because each of the behaviors is independent and each is contributing something unique,” said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center and the first author of the paper, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.

497 2009-08-19 A former Army surgeon accused of falsifying a study on a bone growth product used on severely injured Iraq war veterans has resigned his teaching position at Washington University in St. Louis, a spokeswoman said Tuesday night.

The surgeon, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, 48, was placed on leave earlier this year while the university investigated charges against him. Medtronic, a maker of the bone growth product Infuse, also suspended his consulting contract. The company paid him nearly $800,000 the last few years.

“Dr. Kuklo has agreed to voluntarily resign from the university, effective September 30, 2009,” Joni Westerhouse, a spokeswoman for the medical school, said in an e-mail message Tuesday. “Dr. Kuklo will have no clinical, research, or educational duties for the University between now and that date.”

Dr. Kuklo tendered his resignation on July 30, according to Don Clayton, associate vice chancellor and director for medical public affairs. University officials declined to comment further.

An investigation last year by Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where Dr. Kuklo worked before joining the university, concluded that he had falsified parts of a study that claimed greater benefits than other Army surgeons reported for the Medtronic bone growth product.
498 2009-08-19 Adrian W. DeWind, an adviser to presidents and governors on tax law and an influential advocate in the human rights and nuclear nonproliferation movements, died on Aug. 7 at his home in Manhattan. He was 95.

His death was confirmed by his daughter Penny DeWind.

For more than 35 years, starting in 1948, Mr. DeWind was a partner and head of the tax law department at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a New York law firm. But it was his federal government service that first brought him distinction in the field of tax law.

In 1951 and 1952, Mr. DeWind was chief counsel to a House Ways and Means subcommittee that found corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, now the Internal Revenue Service. The investigation, which was headline news for months, led to the resignation or dismissal of high-level officials and to a major overhaul of the bureau.

Mr. DeWind went into government service in 1942 at the behest of Randolph E. Paul, then the general counsel to the Treasury Department, and helped draft legislation for the financing of the war effort. In 1948, Mr. DeWind followed his mentor to what was then known as Paul, Weiss, Wharton & Garrison. (He was counsel to the House subcommittee while a partner at the firm.)

Over the next 40 years, Mr. DeWind served on tax policy commissions set up by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and Govs. Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo of New York. In 1976, while Mr. DeWind was president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, he headed a task force on taxation for the Municipal Assistance Corporation, set up to steer New York City out of the financial crisis of the 1970s. The task force created a stir when it issued a report saying that the city’s tax structure was “counterproductive, fostering an exodus of business, industry and individuals.”

But Mr. DeWind’s interests extended far beyond tax codes to an extensive list of civic activities. He was chairman of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit group that focuses on environmental issues and arms control, from 1980 to 1992. As chairman of the council, Mr. DeWind signed an agreement in 1986 with the Soviet Academy of Sciences under which American and Soviet scientists established on-site monitoring of nuclear underground testing in both countries.
499 2009-08-19 Nevertheless, an accompanying editorial questioned whether any level of risk is acceptable when inoculating a healthy population against a disease that can be prevented through screening.

“There are not a huge number of side effects here, that’s fairly certain,” said the editorial writer, Dr. Charlotte Haug, an infectious disease expert from Norway, about the vaccine. “But you are giving this to perfectly healthy young girls, so even a rare thing may be too much of a risk.

“I wouldn’t accept much risk of side effects at all in an 11-year-old girl, because if she gets screened when she’s older, she’ll never get cervical cancer,” Dr. Haug said in an interview. “You don’t have to die from cervical cancer if you have access to health care.”

The vaccine was approved for girls and young women ages 9 to 26 and is recommended for routine vaccination of girls 11 and 12.

Merck officials said they were pleased with the findings of the new report.

“This confirms the very favorable safety profile we’ve seen in our extensive clinical trials,” said Dr. Richard M. Haupt, executive director of clinical research for Merck Research Laboratories, adding that while screening is important, the vaccine can reduce the number of abnormal results and procedures, because it prevents infection with four strains of HPV, including two implicated in most cases of cervical cancer today.

“Pap screening alone is not the answer,” Dr. Haupt said.

Another paper in JAMA described how Merck, whose sales of Gardasil totaled $1.4 billion last year, provided professional medical societies with grant money the organizations used to develop educational programs promoting the product. The lectures glossed over questions about the vaccine’s effectiveness and whether booster shots would be needed, said Sheila M. Rothman, the paper’s author.

“The message they were giving was really the drug company message,” said Dr. Rothman, professor of sociomedical sciences at Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia. The marketing strategy overstated the risks of cervical cancer for American women, she said. “It was being marketed as if every girl were at equal risk for this disease and needed this vaccine, even though cervical cancer is not a disease of all women in the U.S. — it particularly affects girls who don’t have access to health care and Pap tests,” Dr. Rothman said.

The study on adverse events analyzed 12,424 reports of adverse events that occurred after immunization with the HPV vaccine from June 1, 2006, to Dec. 31, 2008, when more than 23 million doses of vaccine were distributed, enough to vaccinate more than seven million girls with all three required doses.

That was calculated as a rate of 53.9 adverse event reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for every 100,000 doses of vaccine distributed. Syncope, or fainting, occurred most frequently, with a rate of 8.2 reports per 100,000 vaccine doses, followed by 7.5 per 100,000 for local site reactions and 6.8 per 100,000 for dizziness.

Report rates were then compared with those of other vaccines given in similar populations of girls the same age, Dr. Slade explained.

Of the total number of reports, 6.2 percent, or 772 reports, were considered serious events, including 32 reports of death. Only 20 of the deaths could be verified; the others included four that were provided by the manufacturer without further information, and eight secondhand reports that could not be verified.

Of the 20, 14 of the deceased had only received the HPV vaccine, while others had received multiple vaccines. The average age of the girls who died was 18, and causes of death varied widely — including two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, one case related to prescription drug abuse, one case of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig’s disease, one case of meningoencephalitis, three pulmonary embolisms or blood clots to the lung, six cardiac-related deaths, one case of sepsis related to influenza B and two because of seizure disorders. Four deaths were unexplained.

Dr. Slade said the disparate causes of death made it difficult to determine an underlying cause, or to determine if the vaccine played a causal role.

“We didn’t see any patterns in the causes of death, any pattern in the time between vaccination and death, or the age of the people who died — there just didn’t seem to be any real pattern that would cause us to have heightened concern,” Dr. Slade said, adding that the number of deaths was “actually very similar to what we see after other vaccines in similar age groups.” She said the A.L.S. cases were being investigated further.
500 2009-08-19 But the manpower costs of this focus are steep, and the benefits not always clear. Of the 5,500 leads that the squad has pursued since it was formed five years ago, only 5 percent have been found credible enough to be sent to permanent F.B.I. squads for longer-term investigations, said Supervisory Special Agent Kristen von KleinSmid, head of the squad. Only a handful of those cases have resulted in criminal prosecutions or other law enforcement action, and none have foiled a specific terrorist plot, the authorities acknowledge.

As part of the larger debate about the transformation of the F.B.I., some counterterrorism specialists question the value of threat squads — which are also in , New York and a few other cities.

“Just chasing leads burns through resources,” said Amy Zegart, a professor at the , Los Angeles, who writes extensively on intelligence matters. “You’re really going to get bang for the buck when you chase leads based on a deeper assessment of who threatens us, their capabilities and indicators of impending attack. Right now, there’s more chasing than assessing.”

The F.B.I. director, , has acknowledged the toll of the shift of agents to counterterrorism and intelligence duties. It comes at the cost of resources to combat corporate and financial fraud, and the deadly in . About 40 percent of the bureau’s agents are devoted to fighting terrorism.

The threat squad here is just one part of the F.B.I.’s sprawling Los Angeles field office. About 30 percent of the office’s 750 agents work on terrorism cases, including , , terrorism financing and animal rights extremists.

Federal agents say a major lesson of the Sept. 11 attacks is that all credible reports of possible terrorist activity must be checked. And they say it is more efficient for one squad with specially trained investigators to assess these tips, allowing other agents to stay focused on longer-term terrorist inquiries.

The squad’s work here has yielded important results, officials say. In March 2008, Seyed Maghloubi, an Iranian-born American citizen, was sentenced to 41 months in prison for plotting to illegally export 100,000 Uzi submachine guns to , via .

His arrest stemmed from a tip from a police informant whom Mr. Maghloubi contacted about buying the weapons. The threat squad picked up the tip and developed information that led to a federal sting operation against Mr. Maghloubi.

Responsible for overseeing seven counties and 19 million people in , the threat squad was created in May 2004 after threats to shopping malls on the West Side of Los Angeles diverted about 100 agents from other counterterrorism inquiries.

Working out of a drab office building here 15 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, the investigators sift through tips and threats called in by the public or passed on by a regional intelligence center. The agents check databases and conduct field interviews before deciding whether to act on a case immediately, farm it out to another F.B.I. squad or refer it to another law enforcement agency.

“Someone has to go out and knock on the doors,” said Frank Leal, a 29-year detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department assigned to the threat squad along with investigators from 10 other local, state and federal agencies. “You don’t want any one of those leads to go boom.”

The squad now gets about 80 leads a month, down from a peak of about 140 a month a few years ago, a decline Agent von KleinSmid attributed in part to greater screening of tips by other intelligence analysts.

Recent reported threats range from the mundane to the bizarre.

On Aug. 1, a man called in a bomb threat to a Marriott-chain hotel in Hollywood. The authorities found nothing in a sweep of the hotel. A few hours later, the same man called to ask if the hotel had by any chance lowered its rates recently, and if it would do so if a bomb threat came in.

Security guards have questioned people taking pictures of oil refineries in the Los Angeles area. Many turned out to be college students fulfilling assignment for class projects.

Another recent reported threat sounded like a Hollywood thriller. In June, a college student told her University of California, Riverside, professor that her father, a Pakistani microbiologist, was secretly testing toxins on animals in their basement on the outskirts of Los Angeles. F.B.I. agents, backed by police and hazardous-material experts, moved in on the house only to find nothing. The student had been trying to impress her professor in a weird way, investigators said.

Nicholas M. Legaspi, the lead F.B.I. special agent on the bogus biolaboratory case, said he had no regrets about the effort devoted to the false alarm, which he said had served as an excellent training exercise.

Agent Legaspi said his initial frustration about working on the threat squad was tempered by overseas assignments in which he investigated the attacks in , ; worked alongside American Special Forces in ; and interrogated Qaeda detainees at the American prison at , .

“For the first several years, it was very disappointing always chasing ghosts,” said Agent Legaspi, a former officer in the Army and the California Highway Patrol. “But looking at what goes on overseas keeps me sharp. I realized the terrorists are deadly serious. It makes me hungry to do this job.”
501 2009-08-19 Mentions of the legislation, which narrowly passed the House in June, drew boos, but most of the rally was festive. A high school marching band played, hot dogs and hamburgers were served, a video featuring the country star Trace Adkins was shown, and hundreds of people wore yellow T-shirts with slogans like “Create American Jobs Don’t Export Them” and “I’ll Pass on $4 Gas.”

The buoyant atmosphere belied the billions of dollars at stake for the petroleum industry. Since the House passed the bill, oil executives have repeatedly complained that their industry would incur sharply higher costs, while federal subsidies would flow to coal-fired utilities and renewable energy programs.

“It’s just a sense of outrage and disappointment with the bill passed by the House,” said James T. Hackett, chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum, who attended the rally. He defended, as an environmental measure, the use of buses financed by oil companies and Energy Citizens to carry employees to the rally. “If we all drove in cars, it wouldn’t look good,” he said.

While polls show that a majority of Americans support efforts to tackle climate change, opposition to the climate bill from energy-intensive industries has become more vigorous in recent weeks. The Senate is expected to consider its own version of the bill at the end of September.

A public relations firm hired by a pro-coal industry group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, recently sent at least 58 letters opposing new climate laws to members of Congress. An investigation by the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming found that a total of 13 letters sent by the firm, Bonner & Associates, were forgeries. The committee is currently investigating another 45 letters to determine whether they are fakes. The letters purported to be from groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Hispanic organizations.

Bonner & Associates has acknowledged the forgeries, blaming them on a temporary employee who was subsequently fired. The coal coalition has apologized for the fake letters and said it was cooperating with an investigation of the matter by a Congressional committee.

For its part, the oil industry plans to raise the pressure in coming weeks through its public rallies so that it can negotiate more favorable terms in the Senate than it got in the House. The strategy was outlined by the American Petroleum Institute in a memorandum sent to its members, which include Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The memorandum, not meant for the public, was obtained by the environmental group Greenpeace last week.

“It’s a clear political hit campaign,” said Kert Davies, the research director at Greenpeace.

In the memorandum, the president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack N. Gerard, said that the aim of the rallies was to send a “loud message” to the Senate. He said the rallies should focus on higher energy costs and jobs. “It’s important that our views be heard,” Mr. Gerard wrote.

Cathy Landry, a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute, confirmed the contents of the memorandum, but said that the rally was not strictly an institute event and that Energy Citizens included other organizations representing farm and other business interests.

The House bill seeks to reduce greenhouse gases in the United States by 83 percent by 2050 through a mechanism known as cap and trade, which would create carbon permits that could be bought and sold. President Obama initially wanted these permits to be entirely auctioned off, so that all industries would be on the same footing, but the sponsors of the bill agreed to hand out 85 percent of the permits free to ensure passage of the legislation.

The power sector, which accounts for about a third of the nation’s emissions, got 35.5 percent of the free allowances. Petroleum refiners, meanwhile, got 2.25 percent of these allowances, although the transportation sector accounts for about 40 percent of emissions. That means oil companies would have to buy many of their permits on the open market, and they contend that they would have to raise gasoline prices to do so.

But Daniel J. Weiss, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a research and advocacy organization, said that refiners would be allowed to keep the value of the free allowances they received, while public utilities would be required to return the value of their permits to customers.

“There is a myth out there that this is a giveaway to utilities,” Mr. Weiss said. “It’s not true. The oil industry’s goal is to block or weaken efforts to tackle global warming.”

The rallies have opened a rift within the industry. Royal Dutch Shell, an initial supporter of climate legislation, said that it had told the institute that it would not participate in the rallies, although its employees would be free to attend if they wanted to. ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, has opposed the bill since its passage and, in a note on its Web site, encouraged employees to attend the rallies.

Since Mr. Obama’s election, the oil industry has lost some clout in Washington. The rally on Tuesday gave voice to the feeling among employees of oil companies that their industry was being battered.

“I experienced Carter’s war against the industry, and I’m tired of being pushed around,” said David H. Leland, a geological map maker for NFR Energy. “We provide a product for a reasonable price, and we’re going to be punished for doing a damn good job.”
502 2009-08-19 After months of speculation, Sony announced Tuesday that it was dropping the price of its PlayStation 3 game consoles by $100 in hopes of increasing sales ahead of the important holiday season.

Sony cut the price of the 80-gigabyte PlayStation 3 to $299, effective immediately. It also cut the price of its 160-gigabyte PlayStation 3 by $100, to $399.

And the company said that next month it would release a slimmer, lighter model with a 120-gigabyte hard drive, also priced at $299.

Sales of the PlayStation 3, which was introduced in 2006 and cost as much as $600 at the time, have fallen behind other game consoles.

Last week, the NPD Group, a market research company, reported that American stores sold about 122,000 PlayStation 3 consoles in July, compared with nearly 203,000 Xbox 360 players from Microsoft and more than 252,000 Wii consoles from Nintendo.

The Wii has been priced at $250 since its release in 2006, while Xbox 360 prices now range from $200 for a simple version with no hard drive to $400 for the most expensive version that comes bundled with games. The basic PS3 model remains more expensive than the least-expensive versions of its counterparts.
503 2009-08-19 Some economists prefer to throw out the detailed workings of inputs and outputs in favor of relying on what happened in similar situations in the past. But no one knows which, if any, past episodes are relevant.

There have been many recessions and many debt crises in many countries. But this time really could be different considering the near-zero interest rates, near-record peacetime government deficits and unprecedented government support for the financial system.

Of course, the future will come regardless of whether it is accurately predicted. But investors and experts have good reasons to keep changing their minds. There could be some more big market reversals before the trends are clear.

It looks as if everybody will win something in the UBS tax case. Compromises seem poised to afford the Swiss, the United States and UBS, one of the world’s largest wealth management companies, the opportunity to claim victory as the long-running saga reaches its denouement.

Accusations that UBS encouraged clients to avoid paying taxes had become a matter not only for the courts but also for diplomacy between the United States and Switzerland. The two countries signed a deal last week that could be announced as soon as Wednesday. But pertinent details are already trickling out.

UBS, led by Oswald J. Grübel, is not expected to face more fines, beyond the $780 million assessed in the related criminal prosecution. The United States government will no longer block its business aspirations.

And with the tax case settled, the Swiss government is expected to offload its stake in the largest bank in the country. Still, the cost to the company is huge: a badly damaged franchise in private banking while local politicians seek fraud charges against its former chairmen.

Washington’s doggedness should bear bountiful fruit. It is expected to get the details of some 5,000 of the 52,000 UBS account holders suspected of dodging taxes. Early estimates suggest the disclosed customers will pay fines totaling nearly $4 billion.

Hundreds more clients frightened of being unmasked have already come forward, and many more are expected to follow suit under a new offer of modest leniency.

Tax officials are reported to be collecting 40 percent of an account’s value from those who confess and they are said to be seeking more than double that amount from those whom they catch themselves.

The Swiss government emerges victorious, too, because it is not being required to change the law. Technically, the company is turning over the names of those suspected of an already illegal tax fraud, rather than tax evasion, which isn’t a crime in Switzerland.

Even some tax cheats will find comfort in cracks created by the pursuit of middle ground. The names of 90 percent of UBS clients from the United States won’t be turned over, and the ones that will be disclosed will have the right to challenge this action in Swiss courts.

The clients who do evade fines can find their own small victory here, too, but they will be the only ones not to crow about it.
504 2009-08-19 Engels seemed to lead a kind of double existence almost from the start. Born in 1820, the son of a wealthy German textile manufacturer, he led a life of privilege and was expected to go into the family business. He was more interested, however, in poetry and later in journalism. He felt his way toward his leftist politics through a passionate interest in Hegel’s dialectical philosophical method. When Engels was in his early 20s, his father sent him to work in the family business in Manchester, England. In the horrors he saw there (child labor, the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished laborers) he spied the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age. His time in Manchester led him to write “The Condition of the Working Class in England” (1845), a book Mr. Hunt correctly calls “a tour de force of urban industrial horror.”

Engels’s writing caught the attention of Marx, and the two bonded in Paris during what Mr. Hunt describes as “10 beer-soaked days.” They would remain friends for the next four decades, as they together wrote “The Communist Manifesto,” witnessed the failed Continental revolutions of 1848 and fanned the flames of international communism. Engels would return to Manchester to work for 19 more years in his family business, at a job he loathed, in order to support Marx while he wrote “Das Kapital.”

There is a good deal of gentle comedy in “Marx’s General.” Marx loved to tweak Engels for the ease with which he mingled with upper-middle-class Victorian society in Manchester: the fox hunting, the clubs, the meals. “So now you’re a member of the Exchange, and altogether respectable,” Marx wrote him. “My congratulations. Some time I should like to hear you howling amidst that pack of wolves.”

Marx cashed the checks Engels sent, however, and loved how Engels doted on Marx’s daughters. To spare Marx embarrassment, Engels even accepted the paternity of Marx’s illegitimate son. Engels had no children of his own. He rejected marriage as an institution, and lived with his great love, Mary Burns, an uneducated Irish girl, like husband and wife. When Mary died in 1863, Engels lived with her sister Lizzy, and married her on her deathbed. In 1870, his time in Manchester over, Engels and Lizzy Burns moved to London, where they lived a short walk from the Marx household. After Marx died in 1883, Engels edited the second and third volumes of “Das Kapital,” and his newspaper-filled house became a mecca for socialists from around the world.

In later books like “Socialism: Utopian and Scientific,” Engels delivered comprehensible guides to Marxism, although critics accused him of both simplifying and deviating from Marx’s ideas. Engels died of throat cancer in 1895 at 74.

As artfully as Mr. Hunt flushes out Engels’s human side, he can’t — and to be fair, doesn’t try to — hide the brutal ideologue that also existed inside his cranium. Engels was an advocate, on at least one occasion, of ethnic cleansing; his writing about science helped lead to the abominations of Soviet-style scientific inquiry, which dismissed results that might be seen as bourgeois. He was a master tactician whose purging of rivals in political organizations foreshadowed later purges.

Ultimately, however, Mr. Hunt largely exonerates him. “In no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later,” he writes, “even if the policies were offered up in their honor.” Engels was skeptical of top-down revolutions, Mr. Hunt notes, and later in life advocated a peaceful, democratic road to socialism. He connects Engels the man to Engels the thinker. “This great lover of the good life, passionate advocate of individuality, and enthusiastic believer in literature, culture, art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the Soviet Communism of the 20th century, all the Stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding,” he writes. Engels almost certainly was, in other words, the kind of man Stalin would have had shot.

At the end of this vivid and thoughtful biography, you are quite persuaded that Friedrich Engels would have been a fine man to drink a Margaux with. And it is surely true, as Mr. Hunt puts it, that Engels’s larger critique of capitalism — and his hope for a more dignified kind of humanity — “resonates down the ages.” But what exactly was it about Engels’s thinking and writing, as well as Marx’s, of course, that made it so toxic in the hands of almost everyone else? A more penetrating examination of that question might have made “Marx’s General” an excellent book instead of merely a good one.
505 2009-08-19 Mrs. Merkel has in the past been cautious about Russian investors taking stakes in strategically important companies, like European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS, the parent company of Airbus.

But with German federal elections coming in six weeks, saving jobs matters to Mrs. Merkel, who is poised to win a second term. This explains why she made a big effort last week to promote German economic interests with Mr. Medvedev.

Those interests included the future of the troubled auto manufacturer Opel, and the Wadan Yards in the northern German Baltic ports of Warnemünde and Wismar, which last month filed for bankruptcy protection.

Russian investors are already in the thick of negotiations to take a stake in Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors — a move Mrs. Merkel supported during her news conference with Mr. Medvedev. The deal, which is still being discussed with the German government and General Motors, would give Magna International, a Canadian company, and Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned bank, control of Opel.

The Russians already closed a deal this week to buy the Wadan shipyards. On Monday, the economics ministry in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the yards are based, announced that a board of creditors had agreed to sell the shipyards to Igor Yusufov, a Russian businessman and former energy minister.

Mr. Yusufov, who is also a board member of the giant state-owned energy company Gazprom, agreed to invest up to 40 million euros in the Wadan shipyards, a deal that won strong backing last week from Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Medvedev.

“The contracts are signed and sealed,” Gerd Lange, a spokesman for the economics ministry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said Tuesday. Mr. Lange added that the deal could not have been made without last week’s meeting in Sochi. “That meeting between the chancellor and the Russian president was very important,” Mr. Lange said. “It shows that the Kremlin is supporting the investment in Wadan.”

Mr. Yusufov, who has agreed to save 1,600 of the 2,400 jobs at the Wadan shipyards, intends to use the yards to build icebreakers and gas tankers, and to modernize Russia’s aging fleet. Asked whether Mr. Yusufov had paid too low a price for the shipyards, Mr. Lange replied: “No. Look at the state of the shipbuilding sector worldwide. It is not in good shape. Mr. Yusufov has paid a fair price.”

The previous owner, Andrey Burlakov, a Russian, failed to turn around the yards because he had insufficient political support back home to win orders and he paid too much for the yards, according to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommen government.

The deal struck at Sochi is good news for Mrs. Merkel, whose political constituency is in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a comparatively poor, flat region that has relied on shipbuilding, and more recently tourism, to keep unemployment down.

But the talks at Sochi also showed how much Mrs. Merkel’s relationship with Mr. Medvedev had improved over the last few months, compared with a year ago, when, just days after fighting erupted between Russia and Georgia, Mrs. Merkel flew to Sochi and held a tense meeting with Mr. Medvedev, according to German diplomats.

What has changed in the intervening months is the tone and style of both leaders. Mr. Medvedev has not intimidated Mrs. Merkel — something his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, seemed to be aiming for by having his black Labrador, Koni, sit in on some of the meetings in both Moscow and Sochi. Mrs. Merkel is afraid of dogs.

And when Mrs. Merkel has raised human rights issues with Mr. Medvedev, but not in a lecturing style, he has not dismissed the issues, which Mr. Putin regularly did. Above all, Mr. Medvedev welcomed the cameras and media to Sochi last week, in contrast to Mr. Putin, who tolerated them or kept them at a distance from the official summer residence.

And there were even smiles and jokes, which were rare when Mrs. Merkel met Mr. Putin. The two leaders bantered in their mother tongues with the help of a translator, or else switched to English or Russian, according to a German government aide, who was not authorized to be quoted by name.
506 2009-08-19 “This is not Montana or New Jersey or Florida or any other state where the governor can appoint someone,” he added.

Ms. Sullivan responded that while it might be ideal to have an election for a new lieutenant governor, state law does not provide for it. “We love elections, of course, you’re right,” she said. “But that doesn’t help us when we can’t have an election when we have a vacancy.”

Justice Dickerson quickly cut her off. “This is a special office, a special office,” he said. “There is to be no one who is appointed to take this office.”

Though the questions the four-judge panel was asked to resolve on Tuesday are relatively straightforward — whether a lower court’s order that barred Mr. Ravitch from exercising the powers of the office should be vacated, and whether the case brought by Republicans seeking to remove Mr. Ravitch should be dismissed — the underlying constitutional issues have far-reaching implications.

The case, Skelos v. Paterson, is expected to reach the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. On Tuesday, one of the justices, Steven W. Fisher, raised the possibility that his panel might accelerate its consideration of the case, bypassing the lower court that has already heard arguments and speeding the case to the Court of Appeals.

Justice Fisher said he expected his panel, the Second Department of the Appellate Division in Brooklyn, to rule “as soon as we possibly can.”

The case is expected to clarify whether a governor can name a lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy and, in effect, select his own potential successor and presiding officer of the State Senate.

Indeed, the justices seemed particularly concerned with the possibility that if Mr. Paterson were to leave office or die, an unelected successor of his choosing would become governor.

“The governor might resign, take another position, and then the state would be left with a governor never elected to anything,” Justice Fisher said. “This would be something that the governor could do at his own discretion.”

Ms. Sullivan responded that while the outcome might not be palatable to Justice Fisher, it was an outcome that the Constitution allows. “You may decide it’s not a Constitution you like, but it is the Constitution we have,” she said.

A central argument by Mr. Paterson’s lawyers is that the state’s public officers law, which governs the powers, duties and qualifications for government officials in New York, allows governors to fill vacant offices when state law does not specify how the vacancy should be filled.

But lawyers for Senate Republicans, who brought the case on behalf of Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader, have argued that Mr. Paterson used a political crisis to seize a power that the Constitution does not give him.

“This is really quite simple,” David Lewis, Mr. Skelos’s lawyer, said during oral arguments. “We have never done this.”

He also likened the appointment of Mr. Ravitch to the Roman emperor Caligula’s naming of his horse to public office.

“It’s all well and good to say we now need it,” Mr. Lewis said. “But what we do when we need something, when we step aside from the Constitution because we need something, destroys the very document.”

Mr. Paterson has claimed that the combination of a political crisis in Albany and an economic crisis made his actions necessary. When Mr. Paterson named Mr. Ravitch lieutenant governor on July 8, the Senate was deadlocked, 31 to 31, as Democrats and Republicans fought over the majority leader post.

While the governor has marshaled support in briefs from the New York Civil Liberties Union and watchdog groups like the Citizens Union and Common Cause, some key players in New York politics have disputed his claims.

Stan Lundine, who was lieutenant governor from 1987 to 1994 under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, signed a brief supporting Mr. Skelos that reads in part, “To the extent that there is such a crisis, this does not allow a governor to ignore the State Constitution.” It concludes, “While such a course/conduct may be acceptable in totalitarian regimes, it is a truism that it is not acceptable in New York.”

But former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, in a rare public appearance, attended the arguments on Tuesday in a show of support for Mr. Paterson. “As far as I’m concerned, this review shouldn’t take place,” he told reporters.

In closing, Ms. Sullivan urged the court not to reject the naming of a lieutenant governor simply because no other governor had tried to do it. “Just because the power hasn’t been exercised, of course, does not mean the power does not exist,” she said.
507 2009-08-19 New figures showing a decline in wholesale prices and a drop in new-home construction highlighted how weak the economy remains, even as some optimists declare the recession to be over.

Producer prices fell more than expected in July as the costs of food and energy slipped, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The 0.9 percent monthly decline came after three months of increases, and suggested that demand was weak up and down the ladder of production, from consumer goods to intermediate goods like chemicals and rubber to raw materials.

Producer prices declined a record 6.8 percent from last July, when crude oil prices soared above $145 a barrel and pushed the costs of fuels, food and other products sharply higher. The decline in the last 12 months is the largest drop in 60 years, since the government starting keeping such records.

So-called core prices excluding food and energy costs fell 0.1 percent, their second monthly decline of the year.

The figures offered more evidence that inflation remained a distant concern for the American economy, even as some investors speculate that higher oil prices, rising interest rates and a weaker dollar are in the pipeline, a result of the government’s enormous recovery programs.

510 2009-08-20 The world may be going “Mad Men,” but Doug Pray’s documentary “Art & Copy,” which is being released just five days after the season premiere of that acclaimed television series, presents a very different picture of the advertising industry.

Rather than the cigarette-smoking, tie-wearing swells of the early 1960s, Mr. Pray celebrates a later generation of mavericks who changed the business in the ’70s. His heroes are titans like Lee Clow, Dan Wieden, Hal Riney and George Lois, highly successful businessmen who affect a well-heeled bohemianism  their style would eventually be watered down into casual Fridays  and who don’t always work in New York. Surfing is a recurring theme.

The film consists mostly of these men (and a few women, including the formidable Mary Wells) talking about how they work, which is nearly always interesting, albeit in a minor way that might not justify the price of a theater ticket if you don’t already have an interest in the topic. Mr. Pray, whose previous documentaries include “Scratch,” about hip-hop D.J.’s, and “Surfwise,” tries to whip up some intellectual meringue with an extended metaphor involving ancient stone carvings and communications satellites that’s best ignored. We don’t need him to prove that advertising matters and that its best examples can be taken seriously as art.

It would be nice, though, if he pushed his subjects a little harder when they say  as several do  that they had to fight to convince their clients and peers that the best advertising is based on big, simple ideas and powerful emotions. Are they alarmed that their approach has permeated the culture, from art to journalism to politics? No one seems to be. In their hands, after all, those techniques were stunningly successful, from Mr. Clow’s “1984” Super Bowl spot for Apple to Mr. Riney’s “morning in America” re-election ads for Ronald Reagan.

The foulmouthed Mr. Lois (Tommy Hilfiger, “I Want My MTV”) is the film’s funniest and most endearing character. But the single biggest surprise, for those of us who haven’t heard the story before, is Mr. Wieden’s acknowledgment of the inspiration for his “Just Do It” Nike slogan: “Let’s do it,” Gary Gilmore’s last words before he was executed by a firing squad. Think about that the next time you drop $100 on a pair of retro Air Jordans.

Directed by Doug Pray; original concept by Gregory Beauchamp and Kirk Souder; director of photography, Peter Nelson; edited by Philip Owens; music by Jeff Martin; produced by Jimmy Greenway and Michael Nadeau; released by Seventh Art Releasing. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. This film is not rated.

518 2009-08-20 I know Neat Receipts is years old, and I probably should have covered it long ago. But people, I'm willing to come right out and say it: this thing has changed my life...
519 2009-08-20 Recently, my summer intern David Pierce suggested that I get a Neat Receipts scanner. I'd been vaguely aware of this for years, but I'd never really looked at one.

It was $200. It's a tiny little thing, a white, shiny, plastic thing with roughly the dimensions of a paper-towel core. It connects to your Mac or PC by USB. Basically you feed the receipts into its slot (up to 8.5 by 11, but of course most receipts are much smaller and more irritating). The software on your computer doesn't just display a larger, clearer version of the receipt; it actually attempts to recognize what's on it. It types, into the appropriate boxes on the screen, the vendor, date, amount, category--whatever it can figure out.

Now, it doesn't always get everything right, which is understandable, considering the cruddy dot-matrix printers used to produce lots of these receipts. But it gets most of it right, which is a lot of tedious typing saved. And you can drag numbers right off the picture of the receipt into the correct boxes (Amount, Date, and so on).

David set the thing up, read the manual and gave me a demo. "My dream, though," I told him, "is to be able to churn these things out as a PDF document so I can just sent 'em by e-mail to the clients for reimbursement, instead of all that stamp-and-envelope-and-waiting business." (I'll bet the clients would rather have a tidy PDF, too.)

So it turns out you can drag a bunch of receipts (for a particular trip) into a folder on the screen--the amounts within are tallied automatically--and, yes, print them as PDFs with one click on Export.

"But can they all be multiple tiny pages in a SINGLE PDF?" I asked him. "I don't want to be e-mailing these clients 13 little PDFs." It took him two seconds to find the checkbox called "Combine all items into single PDF."

You can also send receipts by e-mail right from within the program, or spit out a spreadsheet version. The Windows version has even more accounting features, including tax tracking. Both versions can also scan business cards--into Outlook (Windows) or Address Book (Mac)--or regular scannable documents. A new version of the software is due in October, which the company says will bring the features of the Mac and Windows versions into closer parity.

I know Neat Receipts is years old, and I probably should have covered it long ago. But people, I'm willing to come right out and say it: this thing has changed my life. It's actually kind of fun to feed these little scraps of paper into the scanner's mouth and watch them appear on the screen. And now, of course, I don't ever have to worry about making copies of the receipts--they're already copied. In fact, I now find myself with a different problem: what to do with the originals after they've been scanned.

Anyway, I couldn't help telling you about my find. This entire receipts nightmare has vanished from my existence.

533 2009-08-20 “It appears that all those splashy press conferences and impassioned speeches on diversity from Nascar officials were just empty platitudes,” wrote Allen Gregory, the racing columnist for The Bristol Herald Courier in Virginia.

Nascar’s mission statement says: “Nascar is committed to making the sport — on and off the racetrack — look like America. No other issue is more important to Nascar’s success and growth.”

Brian France, chairman of the multibillion-dollar enterprise, has pledged to make “all Americans feel welcome to participate in our sport.”

Nascar has spent millions recruiting diverse drivers, employees, vendors and college interns. It awards Wendell Scott Scholarships and hired his son, Wendell Jr., as a mentor.

But racial incidents have clouded the sport. A crew chief slurred a black driver this spring; a black crewman was confronted by a coworker wearing a pillowcase on his head in 1999; slurs were scrawled in toilets at a track in 2001; a fired Nascar inspector filed a race and sex bias suit in 2008; and critics have objected to Confederate flags waved by some fans.

Nascar says it has zero tolerance for bias and has responded by suspending, barring or firing people in various incidents and by privately settling the bias suit.

The dearth of minority and female racers in the top ranks reflects the prolonged years it takes to develop drivers, who often start training in childhood, said Nascar’s diversity director, Marcus D. Jadotte. He predicted more progress as “we expand into every demographic area and group.”

The history of Scott’s roadblocks remains largely ignored by Nascar. Barred from some races and sometimes cheated in scoring, Scott never landed corporate sponsors, which could have afforded him a first-rate vehicle and a professional crew.

Still, he managed to rank among the top 10 drivers in 147 national races; finish in the top 10 annual standings in four seasons; and win dozens of minor league races, a Virginia state championship and a national race.

The 1977 film “Greased Lightning,” starring Richard Pryor, was loosely based on Scott’s life. Scott, of Danville, Va., died in 1990 at 69.

The debate comes amid revived interest in Scott’s career, chronicled in the biography “Hard Driving” (Steerforth Press, 2008) by Brian Donovan, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist. A Los Angeles Times review praised its “carefully documented” new evidence of Nascar’s “history of racism.”

Supporters will stage a Wendell Scott Recognition Day tribute on Sept. 12 at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville, with speakers and a petition for his induction.

“It’s a lost page of history,” said the organizer, Alexir Hairston, a family friend and artist who painted Scott.

Like many white drivers in the Southern-rooted sport, Scott honed his skills outracing law enforcement to haul moonshine. After starting to race legitimately in 1952, he competed in hundreds of sanctioned contests until injuries in a 21-car pileup forced him to retire in 1973.

Though he has been called the Jackie Robinson of racing, Scott’s initiation was different. While the Brooklyn Dodgers recruited Robinson to integrate baseball, Donovan’s book documented that Nascar’s establishment thwarted Scott.

For years Scott was barred from Darlington Raceway in South Carolina and barred from some races elsewhere. Officials denied him the Rookie of the Year award he had earned and hassled him over trivia like chipped paint and his sons’ beards, the book reports. The most egregious humiliation came in a major 1963 race in Jacksonville, Fla. Scott won by two laps, even beating Richard Petty.

But officials apparently blanched at the prospect of the winner’s customary kiss for the local — white — beauty queen. So the scoreboard went blank, the checkered flag was withheld and the runner-up was crowned victor.

“Everybody in the place knew I won the race,” Scott recalled. Later, officials conceded a “scoring error” and privately gave him a crude wooden trophy with no inscription.

Nascar’s salute to Scott on its Web site cites his Jacksonville victory — but omits the troubles.

Though Scott never complained publicly during his driving years, he endured grandstand jeers and slashed tires and said some drivers intentionally bumped him into crashes.

But he won crossover popularity as a gritty underdog and earned the friendship of many drivers.

Nascar helped some promising white drivers find sponsors, but not Scott.

“If he’d had the equipment or financial backing that I and others had, he would have won more races,” said Ned M. Jarrett, a Hall of Fame nominee who said he once urged Lee Iacocca, then a Ford executive, to aid Scott.

Serving as his own mechanic, Scott made do with inferior cars and amateur crews and sometimes ran on recapped tires. “They wasn’t going to help a black man,” he told Donovan. “That’s all there was to it.”

The financing problem persists. Harry L. Davis, whose son Marc, 19, was mentored by Wendell Scott Jr., said, “Until sponsorship is attached to diversity drivers, nobody is going to make it.”

Charlotte Motor Speedway’s former president, H. A. Wheeler, said Scott “was obviously a much better race driver than the record shows.”

Jadotte, Nascar’s diversity director, said, “Nascar embraces and celebrates Wendell Scott’s contribution to the sport.”

While Scott’s travails haunt the debate at Nascar, his achievements have won honors elsewhere, including the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega, Ala., and the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame in Darlington, S.C.

A 50-member panel will choose Nascar’s five inaugural inductees this fall, followed by new selections annually.

Whether Scott is eventually inducted, “there will definitely be recognition of his career in the exhibit on diversity,” said the Hall’s director, Winston B. Kelley.

Like Scott’s sanitized salute on Nascar’s Web site, however, the exhibit is not expected to delve into issues like the Jacksonville dispute, Kelley said.
534 2009-08-20 For the second straight day on Wednesday, the Mets showcased their top-draft pick, Steven Matz, a left-handed pitcher from Long Island whom they picked in the second round and whom they hope will be the gem of their 2009 draft class. In a year marked by disappointment at almost every turn, the Mets were busy promoting Matz as aggressively as they could.

But Matz was only part of the 2009 draft story for the Mets, and other elements were not as positive. The team failed to sign its fifth-round pick, Damien Magnifico of Mesquite, Tex., and its sixth-round pick, David Buchanan of Florida, each a right-handed pitcher. In fact, the Mets were only one of three major league teams — Texas and Tampa Bay were the two others — that signed only seven players from the first 10 rounds of the draft.

In addition, the Mets, who did not have a first-round pick, were one of only four teams that ended up with more than one top-10 pick unsigned. Even lowly Pittsburgh signed all 11 of its picks in the first 10 rounds, spending over $8 million to do so. Other teams like San Diego (10 for 10), Arizona (15 for 15), and Colorado (12 for 12) also signed all of their picks in the first 10 rounds, and each team spent at least $7 million.

The Mets, meanwhile, spent $1,864,300 in the first 10 rounds of the draft, less money than any of the other 29 major league teams. Their decision to do so, amid a poor season on the major league level and continuing criticism that their minor league system is weak, inevitably raises questions about the Mets’ overall strategy.

Still, in an interview on Wednesday, Rudy Terrasas, the Mets’ director of amateur scouting and the person in charge of the draft, said that the club had been aggressive in trying to sign the players it selected this year.

536 2009-08-20 While the private sector has shed 6.9 million jobs since the beginning of the recession, state and local governments have expanded their payrolls and added 110,000 jobs, according to a report issued Thursday by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government.

The report, based on an analysis of federal jobs data, found that state and local governments steadily added jobs for eight months after the recession began in December 2007, with their employment peaking last August. State and local governments have since lost 55,000 jobs, but from the beginning of the recession through last month they gained a net of 110,000 jobs, the report found, in part because of the federal stimulus program.

Government jobs are always more stable than private sector jobs during downturns, but their ability to weather the current deep recession startled Donald J. Boyd, the senior fellow at the institute who wrote the report.

“I am a little surprised at the fact that state and local government has remained as stable as it has in the nation as a whole, given the depth of the current recession,” Mr. Boyd said in an interview.

The report offered several possible explanations for the disparity between the private and public sectors. It noted that there can be a short lag between an economic downturn and the time it hits states in the form of lower tax collections, and an even longer delay before the problems hit local governments in the form of reduced state aid and lower property tax collections.

It pointed to the slow pace of decision-making in many states, and the power yielded by politically influential unions. But it also noted that the demand for many government services rises in a recession, and said that billions of dollars of federal stimulus money sent to states helped them avert layoffs.

The expansion, coming as many states and localities are raising taxes, troubled Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington. “That is disturbing,” Mr. DeHaven said. “Basically what you have is your producers in society losing their jobs and looking for work, and their tax burden isn’t necessarily going down  and as a matter of fact they are likely to face tax increases going forward  and government growing.”

States are likely to cut more jobs this year. Many have already imposed furloughs on their workers, reducing their pay, and with states facing record declines in tax collections, several are planning to cut their work forces. The report noted that some hard-hit states had already made deep cuts, led by Arizona, which cut its state government employment by 8.6 percent from the spring of 2008 to this spring.

The disparity between the public and private sector job market is striking in places like Boise, Idaho. Since the recession began, the area’s unemployment rate has more than doubled, to over 10.1 percent in June, as big employers, especially in the technology sector, shed workers. The Boise area lost 20,000 jobs in the year ending in June, the Idaho Labor Department said, and saw real gains only in government, which had an increase of 1,400 jobs, mostly in the public schools.

Jon Hanian, a spokesman for Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican in his first term, said jobs in state government outside of education were declining. The new state budget, which took effect last month, cuts agencies across the board by 5 percent, Mr. Hanian said, but lets agencies decide whether to impose furloughs, cut wages or eliminate positions.

Kerry Korpi, the director of the research and collective bargaining department at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union representing government employees, said the public sector often lagged behind the economy in both downturns and recoveries. Ms. Korpi said that a growing number of government jobs were being eliminated now, and that many government workers had been forced to take pay cuts and pay more for benefits. And she noted that government workers were providing services that are needed in a downturn.

“At a time like this,” she said, “it’s really hard to lay people off at your unemployment office or your food stamp office, where they’re having trouble keeping up with what they’ve got.”

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, recently reported that 30 states had raised taxes since January, and that at least 40 states were furloughing workers or eliminating jobs through attrition or layoffs. Many are cutting vital services, the center said.

“Crunch time is still to come for the states,” said Jon Shure, the deputy director of the center’s state fiscal project.
537 2009-08-20 Mr. Ward stayed at the hospital, Lifebridge Health, for three more years and in 2007 moved to his current post at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Md., as director of corporate strategy. Still a big sports fan, he produces Ravens football games for WBAL radio on weekends.

The Hopkins school, which also offers a three-year master’s of public health degree, is the largest of dozens of accredited graduate and undergraduate programs in hospital management. Many managers with experience in fields like human resources, finance and marketing find a welcome in health care, with a little studying up. Online courses, books, journals and professional magazines provide material.

The American College of Healthcare Executives, based in Chicago, offers several online pages of career tips, including a two-year-old salary summary at www.ache.org. The Association of University Programs in Health Administration also lists contact information for many schools at www.aupha.org.

“We just recently recruited a vice president for human resources from the supermarket industry,” said Mike A. Helm, a senior executive at Sutter Health, a hospital chain with 45,000 employees in Northern California. Sutter hires 20 to 30 executives a year.

Health care does, of course, have its own jargon and a host of complex challenges. Managers have to know how to deal with doctors, nurses and professional groups, as well as with regulators.

“There are tons and tons of regulations, and the burden is growing,” said Dr. Steven A. Wartman, president of the Association of Academic Health Centers, a nonprofit group whose members are both research and health sciences universities that include hospitals.

The Obama administration’s $19 billion 10-year campaign to promote electronic medical records opens another huge opportunity, said Dr. Blackford Middleton, a technology research expert at Partners Healthcare in Boston. An estimated 40,000 to 160,000 additional health information professionals could be needed, he said.

Dr. Middleton is helping to develop an executive education course at the nonprofit American Medical Informatics Association and a certificate course at the Harvard School of Public Health. online, and the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health sponsors some informatics fellowships.

The industry trade association, known as Himss for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, offers an array of online courses that can help technology workers move into health care. Last month, Himss established its eLearning Academy, which, it says, “offers round-the-clock, on-demand access,” allowing students to work at their own pace on subjects like clinician-focused use of information technology, I.T. customer service to the health care user, and health care I.T. strategic planning.

James Platts, 30, chose a more formal academic setting for his training in health care management and completed the joint master’s program in business and public health at the University of California, Berkeley. He now works on health-related projects in the San Francisco office of the Boston Consulting Group.

He came to Berkeley in 2006 from the White House, where he was a junior-level staff member at the National Economic Council for two years. A Harvard graduate in economics, he also put in two years at Nasdaq, studying financial and economic data.

“I thought it would be fun and interesting from a health care perspective to live in California for a few years,” Mr. Platts said, referring to California’s large-scale health care issues and solutions.

Graduates of the Berkeley program are hired at an “average salary somewhat over $100,000,” said Kristi Raube, director of the joint health management program there. Tuition has tripled since 2007, to $35,893 for California residents and $45,093 for out-of-state students pursuing the joint master’s degree.

“Of course, nobody knows what will happen with health reform,” Dr. Wartman noted. One possibility could be pressure to cut costs by freezing hiring and squeezing out management jobs at hospitals and health insurers.

But, he said, “there is a very strong push to cover more people, with a lot of implications for growth in the health care work force.” Other drivers of growth, Dr. Wartman said, include “the continued march of science and technology, as well as uninvited developments such as new diseases.”
538 2009-08-20 Among the hot areas now are positions related to minimizing risk, as firms try to mitigate the chances of another financial crisis. Risk in general is a relatively new focus, and the openings range from business, credit and operational risk to product and technology risk. “Risk is everywhere,” said Jeanne E. Branthover, head of the global financial services practice at Boyden Global Executive Search.

Recruiters say obtaining financial risk manager or professional risk manager certifications is an option for those looking for broad risk management knowledge, while the credit risk certification is an option for professionals with backgrounds in credit and lending. Business schools are also adding to their risk-related continuing education offerings, which can make obtaining the certifications easier and can provide extensive networking opportunities.

This year, the Stern School of Business at New York University started offering an executive master’s in risk management in partnership with the Amsterdam Institute of Finance. During the program, which lasts a year and costs 42,000 euros, or about $60,000, students meet 10 times for multi-day sessions and study subjects including risk metrics, credit risk and liquidity risk. The course covers about 75 percent of what one is required to know for the professional risk manager certification, said Ingo Walter, a professor of finance at Stern.

Stern also offers a less technical three-day executive education session on integrated risk management. Columbia Business School and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University are among other institutions that offer similar programs, which range in cost from $3,750 to $10,000.

Another area becoming more important as financial firms prepare for more government regulation is compliance, and recruiters expect compensation for such positions to increase. “Any role within compliance is in hot demand right now,” said Timothy Holt, a managing partner at Heidrick & Struggles International, an executive search firm.

Risk certifications provide some compliance training, and law degrees are always a great entry into compliance roles. But some specific compliance designations and courses can help, too. These include the American Bankers Association’s certified regulatory compliance manager designation and the certified regulatory and compliance professional designation, from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Institute at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Both organizations also offer shorter training courses that don’t lead to certification but can enhance a résumé.

Financial companies are hiring for their wealth management departments and training programs and are looking for employees who know how to generate revenue and already have clients, said Danny Sarch, the founder of and a recruiter for Leitner Sarch Consultants, an executive search company. Those with the certified financial planner or certified investment management analyst credentials are good candidates for those opportunities, he said.

Positions related to cash and balance sheet management — such as controller, accountant and treasurer — are also available, recruiters say, and candidates would benefit from a certified public accountant or certified treasury professional certification.

In many cases, just passing the C.P.A. exam can be enough, even without the work experience required for licensing. “It shows that you took the initiative and that you are qualified because you passed,” said Steve Shapiro, a recruiter for the executive search firm JSB Partners in New York.
539 2009-08-20 Q. My Twitter feed is often dominated by a particular individual. Is there a way to filter out these tweets on a temporary basis without “unfollowing” the person?

A. At least one site, TwitterSnooze, lets you temporarily turn off — or snooze — the posts from someone who excitedly fills your screen with an avalanche of tweets from the academic conference, the Star Trek convention or the road trip you are not a part of. To snooze someone, just log into twittersnooze.com, enter your Twitter name and password, and the Twitter name of the person you want to forget for a while — and the length of time you would like to take a break.

TwitterSnooze then “unfollows” the selected user for the specified time before returning the person to the list of people you follow. Because Twitter sends a message announcing that you are following that person again, TwitterSnooze is not the most subtle way to turn off the tweets for a few days.

Programs like TweetDeck (tweetdeck.com) that let you organize the people you follow into small groups provide another way to focus on the people you really want to hear from.
540 2009-08-20 “We’ve had about 23 recoveries that we’ve been told about,” Mr. Mullen said. “More often than not, it’s from people who’ve just lost their devices.”

A more advanced method of recovery is for the gadget to tell its owner where it is.

This isn’t as James Bondian as it may sound: most smartphones have GPS technology, so location services are already built in. And every time a laptop connects to the Internet, it is assigned an IP (Internet Protocol) address by the Internet service provider. If the embedded recovery software records and transmits the IP address to its owner, the owner can usually get the service provider to determine the actual address with that data. (Be advised that this may require a warrant.)

Some software can go a bit further. Technology from GadgetTrak ($25 a year for most devices) can use the laptop’s Wi-Fi circuitry to collect the names and the signal strength of all Wi-Fi base stations in range. This can often locate a device.

All of this information about a device’s location makes its way back to the owner through various paths. IHound, for instance, stores the data in its servers and may record thousands of reports. A user can log into the iHound servers and check the latest reports and, if necessary, print out a list of recent locations to give to the police.

GadgetTrak takes a different approach. It collects nothing at its servers, but its software sends an e-mail message with the location directly to the user. GadgetTrak can also snap photos with any built-in camera and upload them to the owner’s Flickr account.

Apple’s MobileMe service ($99 a year) lets iPhone owners track and control their phone remotely. Users can determine an iPhone’s location and, with a command, wipe all the data off the phone by visiting the MobileMe Web site (if you have wiped the phone clean and later find or recover it, you can restore the data from your computer).

When the user reports a theft, recovery companies respond in different ways. Many just pass along all of the information about the location directly to the owner. While this may be efficient if the device has simply been misplaced, it may be dangerous if it has fallen into the hands of criminals.

“We will purposefully never reveal a location to a consumer customer,” said John Livingston, chief executive of Absolute Software. The company’s Computrace package ($14 to $53 a year) is marketed as “Lojack for Laptops,” and is available as a preinstalled option on computers from Lenovo, Dell, HP and other manufacturers. “We won’t do it. Once you declare that it’s lost or stolen, we take control over the location at that point. We purposely keep some safe distance between the end user and the thief.”

Absolute employs a team of 40 investigators with experience in law enforcement. They track the location, remotely install extra software for capturing keystrokes and build a dossier of evidence that they pass on to local authorities.

There are some more basic online systems that don’t depend upon adding extra software or asking the gadget to phone home. The Web site Juststolen.net lets you store the serial number of your devices in its database, which the police can then search, and flag any that they have recovered.

Tom Shea, a police officer in a town outside of Boston, started Juststolen in his spare time after he grew frustrated with manufacturers that did little to help him track down owners.

He points out that companies often record serial numbers to market to customers, but they often will not open this information to the police looking to solve a crime or reunite a device with an owner.

“These companies that can definitely identify this property won’t cooperate with us. Even if we recover your radio today, they’re not going to tell us it’s yours,” he said.

If all of the other techniques fail, the Undercover program from Orbicule ($49 for Macs; $4.99 for iPhones) has a “Plan B” for laptops that makes the computer’s screen dimmer and more erratic. This makes it less valuable and may even encourage the thief to take the device to a repair shop, which might detect that it had been stolen.

Absolute Software is working with Intel to create a mechanism that will not just delete the data, but permanently disable the computer.

“It’s another arrow in the quiver,” Mr. Livingston said. “If we can’t get a computer back, we can at least turn it into a brick.”
541 2009-08-20 MOSCOW — The Israeli president, Shimon Peres, said Wednesday that his Russian counterpart, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had promised to reconsider Russia’s plans to provide advanced surface-to-air missiles to Iran, a deal that Washington has also sought to halt.

The missiles would offer Iran considerable confidence that it could prevent airstrikes on its nuclear sites.

But a Russian official close to the talks, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of their delicacy, said the contract between Russia and Iran was not discussed. Mr. Peres did raise the issue of the missiles, known as S-300s, the official said, but Mr. Peres emphasized that Israel did not plan any military strikes on Iranian territory.

“Accordingly, there was no discussion on the presidential level of any contractual obligations of Russian organizations regarding the provision of military equipment to Iran,” the official said.

Russia signed a contract with Iran to deliver S-300 missiles, which have a much longer range and higher accuracy than Iran’s present air defense systems. But amid the objections of Israel and the United States, Moscow has never delivered the missiles.
542 2009-08-20 It is not clear how UBS will decide which clients to unmask, though American officials have said that they are interested only in the biggest accounts — some containing hundreds of millions of dollars — and accounts that made use of offshore entities and sham corporations.

The agreement is another victory for the I.R.S. and the Justice Department in the long-running case against UBS, which in February paid $780 million and admitted to criminal wrongdoing in selling services that enabled tax evasion. Larger Swiss banks like UBS and have curtailed banking services for wealthy Americans in response to the increased scrutiny.

Some smaller, centuries-old private Swiss banks, however, are stepping up their efforts to attract American money, given the importance of foreign clients to the nation’s financial institutions.

Executives at smaller Swiss banks and trade groups say they are increasingly working with Swiss financial and legal companies to set up offshore entities as a way to shield assets from prying regulatory eyes. They have also been reassuring clients that their accounts will remain confidential.

Sebastian Dovey, a managing partner at Scorpio Partnership, a wealth consulting firm in , said that “we have not seen huge amounts of movement” of American money out of Swiss banks.

The current penalty for this type of failure to disclose assets is up to 50 percent of the highest annual balance of each account for each of the last three years — an amount that can quickly wipe out an investor and still leave him owing taxes and interest.

Investors who come forward before Sept. 23 face a reduced penalty, of 5 percent to 20 percent, depending in part on whether the wealth was inherited. They will also be hit with the penalty just once, on the highest balance in the accounts during the last six years.

The Justice Department has opened criminal investigations of 150 UBS clients, and is likely to bring more indictments on top of the four it brought in recent months. Only clients who are prosecuted are likely to have their names become public.

The landmark settlement is expected to provide a road map for the I.R.S. as it tries to clamp down on tax evasion by Americans who use offshore accounts.

Smaller Swiss banks are still helping clients hide billions of dollars through complex structures in offshore havens in the , , , and Guernsey in the English Channel. The crackdown is casting a spotlight on the network of lawyers, accountants and advisers who help underpin the Swiss private banking industry by steering clients to such banks.

An American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said this week that the Justice Department was preparing criminal cases against some of the Swiss agents and intermediaries who set up offshore entities for clients and funnel their money to private banks. They take a referral fee in the process — sometimes up to 50 percent, according to a former UBS private banker.

A little-known I.R.S. program, the Offshore Identification Unit, is helping to build a map of this world. It recently began tracking all disclosures of wealthy Americans who, unnerved by the UBS situation, have come forward to declare their assets and account details, often naming the private banks and intermediaries they used.

Glimpses of the network were revealed last month when one UBS client, Jeffrey P. Chernick, of , N.Y., pleaded guilty to criminal charges of evading taxes on $8 million he put into UBS accounts in the and . Mr. Chernick worked with and received advice from a Swiss lawyer and a bank executive at a small private bank in Zurich, neither of them UBS employees, according to court records.

Many intermediaries still extol the advantages of Swiss accounts, including Swiss political and economic stability, its European base and its high level of client service — and the fact that Switzerland has not traditionally considered tax evasion to be a crime.

Micheloud & Cie, which has offices in and other Swiss cities, offers to help clients set up accounts at the biggest private banks in Switzerland. Its Web site describes such accounts as “the ultimate symbol of wealth, personal achievement and privacy,” and advises clients on how to set up numbered accounts with code names like and

The firm says it will not accept clients who are citizens of various countries that it considers undesirable, including , , — and now the . But it also assures prospective clients that “Swiss bank secrecy is not lifted for tax evasion, even upon the request of a foreign government.”

Other countries have also pressured Switzerland in recent months for names of suspected tax cheats, including and . The attention has left Swiss bankers perturbed about demands that they ensure that their clients pay their taxes.

“The American authorities are trying to use the banks as guardians of the clients’ conscience, which is not really what we’re here for,” said Michel Y. Dérobert, secretary general of the Swiss Private Bankers Association in , a trade group of traditional private banks. “Priests are better for that.”
543 2009-08-20 The Afghan government announced Wednesday that it had managed to secure enough districts to allow voting to go ahead in roughly 6,600 polling centers — more than in the previous election in 2004.

But the extent of the areas affected by insecurity, especially in southern Afghanistan, had become clearer as the election drew near. The election commission said it still had to deliver election materials to four districts around the country and would have to use helicopters because the roads were too unsafe.

Unlike the last election, in 2004, Afghans will do most poll monitoring themselves on Thursday. Election monitors said they would be able to cover more than 60 percent of districts.

Yet Ahmad Nader Nadery, head of the largest independent Afghan monitor mission, the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, acknowledged concerns that there would be no monitors in some of the most insecure districts where intimidation and fraud were most likely to occur. Instead, candidates’ representatives will be the only check on fraud in those areas.

Mr. Karzai had appeared on state television and called on people to vote despite Taliban threats, saying the security forces would ensure their safety. The announcement drew criticism from the election commission for breaking a campaign blackout during the last 48 hours before the vote, but it was an indication of how concerned the government is about low turnout.

Mr. Karzai made another appeal Thursday as he showed up to vote, The Associated Press reported. “I request from the Afghan people to come out and vote so through their vote Afghanistan will be more secure, more peaceful,” he said.

Two months ago, Mr. Karzai seemed to dominate the field as the only apparent choice for Afghans, even though his popularity slipped with criticism of deteriorating security, corruption and a lack of jobs.

But Mr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister and eye doctor who is running for the main opposition movement, the United Front, has since managed to tap a widespread hunger for change, especially in the north.

Live televised debates, which also included a former finance minister, Ashraf Ghani, and a former minister of planning, Ramazan Bashardost, were heard and watched by millions, engaging Afghans in the election process even as the Taliban escalated threats and attacks.

In a late development, local Taliban leaders agreed to allow people in Wardak Province, just south of Kabul, to vote unmolested, a government minister said. He asked not to be named because of the political nature of the information. The minister said he believed that the Taliban would allow the vote to go ahead in the south, despite their threats.

Yet he also expressed concern that one devastating suicide bombing could deter voters across the country.

At three polling stations in west Kabul early Thursday, turnout was lower than in the 2004 presidential election.

At one, Mitra Hemat, 24, an election worker, said the turnout was significantly down. “There are very few people. People are afraid, I can tell.”

It is unclear whether the numbers were as low across the city, or whether voters were waiting to judge the streets were safe before coming out later in the day.

Allies of Mr. Karzai said they thought he could still win in the first round, with over 50 percent of ballots.

Despite gains by his opponents, Mr. Karzai fought back hard in the last two weeks, making selective campaign stops and securing the return of a former Uzbek warlord, Abdul Rashid Dostum, from exile. The Uzbek leader has been widely criticized for past human rights abuses, and opponents and Western diplomats have condemned the president’s association with him as an example of the unsavory alliances Mr. Karzai has made to try to secure his re-election.

Mr. Dostum may prove critical, however, in plugging a hole in Mr. Karzai’s support by bringing the ethnic Uzbek vote in the north to his side. Even Mr. Abdullah’s supporters conceded that Mr. Dostum’s return was a blow, one insider said.

On Wednesday three Taliban gunmen seized control of a bank in Kabul and engaged the police in a two-hour gun battle. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack after the three gunmen had been killed by the police.

Election officials reported that six election workers had been killed Tuesday in roadside bombings.

“We have mixed feelings,” said Mr. Nadery, director of the Afghan election monitoring organization.

“On the one hand, there is this excitement and the feeling that we are moving on. The 2004 presidential election was an event and now we are turning it into a process. It is not full democracy but it is bringing us to a different way of politics that is not through violence,” he said.

“But of course we have the increased level of intimidation,” he added. “This transition is costly and that worries us.”

559 2009-08-21 The A.C.L.U. is working with the defense lawyers’ association in a joint effort to provide civilian lawyers and research assistance to the military defense lawyers. The lawyers are representing clients who have been charged with terrorism crimes related to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, before a military commission.

As part of that effort, called the John Adams Project, researchers have been trying to identify which C.I.A. officials participated in harsh interrogations of the detainees under the Bush administration’s program of secret C.I.A. prisons. President George W. Bush ordered the Qaeda suspects transferred to the prison at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2006.

Defense lawyers contend their clients were illegally tortured and are considering calling the C.I.A. officers to the witness stand if the military commission trials — which President Obama halted shortly after he took office, but has since proposed reviving in a modified form — are resumed. Several of the detainees could be executed if convicted.

Joshua Dratel, a lawyer with the John Adams Project and a former board member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, also confirmed that the group had learned about two weeks ago that the F.B.I. had questioned three military defense lawyers about photographs allegedly obtained by John Adams Project researchers and provided to the lawyers.

It was not clear what law investigators may think had been broken. Both Mr. Romero and Mr. Dratel disputed that there could have been anything illegal about showing photos taken in public to the detainees. “If you get information in the public record, it doesn’t become classified just because the government feels it is embarrassing or that they would prefer you not to show it to anyone,” Mr. Dratel said. “There is no prohibition on gathering public-source information and showing it to your client.”

Mr. Romero said researching what had happened to their clients in the hands of government agents was “a normal part of criminal defense work.”

“Identifying who tortured our clients and what they did to them and when is an essential part of defending their interests in these sham proceedings,” he said.
560 2009-08-21 Experts said that the Iranian president and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, might have calculated that resolving the nuclear standoff could satisfy two needs. It could help the troubled economy by heading off new sanctions — and possibly assist in lifting existing sanctions — while giving the two leaders much-needed credibility for having achieved a positive policy objective.

Experts were quick to caution that this outline might well prove to be wishful thinking. Trying to discern events in Iran today is something like the Kremlin-watching that went on during the cold war. Repression, arrests and censorship have made independent reporting impossible in Iran. Indeed, there is a competing view that Iran will never make any concessions on its nuclear program, figuring that conflict with Washington may restore some degree of national unity.

Moreover, some experts said that Iran’s severe political crisis had caused such unprecedented paralysis and infighting that Mr. Ahmadinejad might not have the power to carry out any cohesive policy in a bitterly divided government.

Nevertheless, the appointment of Mr. Salehi to head the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran — even though it is the supreme leader who decides nuclear policy — was seen as significant enough to warrant at least a flicker of optimism.

Mr. Salehi served as Iran’s representative to the I.A.E.A. when the reform leader Mohammad Khatami was president. It was during that time, in 2003, that the agency became aware of Iran’s 18 years of lying about its secret nuclear program. For Mr. Ahmadinejad, Mr. Salehi’s appointment also serves a political purpose: he succeeds Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the agency’s longtime director, who is seen as an ally of Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leader of the political opposition.

One Western diplomat who spent years working in Iran and has grown increasingly pessimistic about its political future, said there was at least one hopeful sign.

“One signal deserves to be explored,” he said. “It seems that in the past few days the Iranians have been surprisingly cooperative with the I.A.E.A.”

Iran allowed the agency’s inspectors to visit the nearly finished Arak heavy water reactor last week after a yearlong ban, diplomats told The Associated Press. Last week, they added, Tehran acceded to the agency’s requests to expand its monitoring of the Natanz uranium enrichment site, which produces nuclear materials that could be further enriched to weapons grade.

But the chances of making progress on the nuclear issue may hinge on developments in the Iranian government. While the turmoil that gripped the capital, Tehran, after the June presidential election has eased, many experts say, the fight now seems to have moved inside the institutions of power, possibly limiting Mr. Ahmadinejad’s room to maneuver.

“Ahmadinejad will have great difficulty governing,” said Muhammad Sahimi, an Iranian expatriate and professor at chemical engineering at the University of Southern California who remains in close contact with a network of friends and relatives around Iran. “He is being opposed on all sides. Khamenei’s authority has been greatly damaged. Cracks in the conservative camp have become too glaring, and every day there are new revelations.”

Still, most experts on Iran’s nuclear policy say they are heartened by what they have seen of late, though they are not expecting any breakthroughs.

Iran’s representative to the I.A.E.A., Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said this week that Tehran would agree to “talks without preconditions.” He is close to Mr. Salehi, the new head of the Iranian atomic agency, and even though Mr. Soltanieh retracted the statement a day later, the incident was seen by some as another possible signal.

“I think Iran plays a little cat and mouse now at the I.A.E.A. level,” said one commentator with expertise on the nuclear issue. “He did not make the original statement without Tehran’s authorization.”
561 2009-08-21 The State Department issued a permit for the construction of a new pipeline to bring crude oil from Western Canada to the United States. The pipeline, to be built by Enbridge Energy Partners, will run from tar sands in Northern Alberta to Wisconsin. Extraction of oil from the sands is done through open pit mining and has stirred controversy because it is energy and water intensive. Sarah Burt, a lawyer for Earthjustice, said that environmental groups had hoped the Obama administration would block the pipeline . “This basically commits us to 50 more years of one of the most greenhouse gas intensive fuels around,” Ms. Burt said. She said that Earthjustice would seek an injunction to block the pipeline. But Denise Hamsher, a spokesperson for Embridge, said that construction would begin right away along portions of the pipeline. LESLIE KAUFMAN
562 2009-08-21 Ms. Mathers said the price decline this year “provides important relief,” adding that “it won’t bring the old plants back but it will save the remaining U.S. production.”

Gas executives saw a silver lining, arguing that the low prices would help them make a case in the Senate when it takes up energy and climate change legislation later this year. The gas companies want federal incentives to sway utilities to switch to gas from coal, and they want more government entities and businesses to convert their diesel bus and truck fleets to compressed natural gas.

The House version of the legislation, passed in June, disappointed industry leaders who contended that coal interests got a better deal than they did, even though gas is a cleaner fuel.

The weekly Energy Department natural gas stockpile report showed that underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 52 billion cubic feet, to about 3.2 trillion cubic feet, for the week that ended last Friday. That is a storage level 21 percent above the level a year earlier and 19 percent above the average for the last five years at this time of year.

It is normal for stockpiles to grow during the summer, but the current level is usually reached in late September or October.

Natural gas is produced from wells at a fairly steady rate, but use of the fuel is highly seasonal, so summertime production is stored in large reservoirs for use during the winter. The country has about four trillion cubic feet of gas storage capacity, almost entirely in tapped-out wells, salt caverns and aquifers.

Gas demand is so weak and supply so abundant that some experts think the country could run out of storage capacity before the winter heating season begins, requiring gas companies to reduce flow from their wells or even shut down production.

Gas executives, who have already cut back severely on drilling new wells this year, say they are loath to cut production on wells already completed, but they may have no other choice if the storage system and pipeline network get backed up.

“We have never been here before in terms of what to expect when storage gets this high,” said Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, another major gas producer. “It’s like a balloon; there comes a point where you can’t blow any more air into it.”

Mr. McClendon said he hoped that low gas prices could stimulate more replacement of coal with gas by utilities, something that is beginning to happen in some places, and he was also hopeful a cold winter would spur demand.

“It doesn’t set the stage for $10 gas, but it does set the stage for $6 to $8 gas, which is in our view a fair price for consumers and producers,” Mr. McClendon added.

Kenneth B. Medlock III, an energy economist at Rice University, said there had not been such a drastic storage buildup since 2002, the last time gas prices swooned during a recession. But he said the situation could be temporary and prices could quickly rebound, noting, “If the economy starts to recover, and recover quickly, we will eat through those inventories very quickly.”

The price decline is rooted in supply and demand. Energy experts note that factories and power plants have slowed production because of the weak economy. The Energy Department reported that consumption of natural gas was down about 5 percent in May from May 2008.

On the supply side, a boom in domestic production has followed improvements in recent years in drilling technology, opening immense shale gas fields across Appalachia, the Great Plains and northern Texas and Louisiana.

Trying to head off the developing glut, the industry shut down gas rigs at a rapid pace over the first half of the year. According to the Baker Hughes oil service company, the number of gas rigs operating around the United States has been reduced to 688, from 1,586, since last August.

But because many of the shale wells are new and just beginning to flow, production has remained high. In fact, natural gas output this year has been slightly higher than last year despite the sharply declining rig count.

Industry executives say they are concerned that if the economy and prices do not recover, it will cripple smaller independent companies. Many suggest larger companies may soon buy independents at bargain prices.

“You are cutting into muscle now,” said Rodney L. Waller, a senior vice president at Range Resources. “Companies’ viability is being questioned. If you have sustained price reductions, you will see consolidation and layoffs.”

The price of gas plunged by more than 5 percent Thursday morning after the storage report was released, and trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled at $2.945 per thousand cubic feet. That is a 78 percent drop from the peak that gas hit on July 3, 2008, of $13.58.
563 2009-08-21 Dollar General, the discount retailer owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, filed for an initial public offering with regulators on Thursday, in what many analysts expect to be a swell of companies owned by private equity firms regaining stock listings.

Dollar General said in its filing that it was seeking to raise $750 million, which would make it one of the bigger initial offerings this year. Kohlberg Kravis will help underwrite the sale.

As the stock markets have posted gains this year, private equity firms — which typically hold onto companies for several years — have indicated that they will seek to cash out by taking their acquisitions public.

Dollar General said in its filing that it would pay a special $200 million dividend to its existing investors. Kohlberg Kravis acquired the retailer for $7.2 billion in 2007.

The retailer, known for its low-priced wares, has performed well in the recession. It reported an $83 million profit for the quarter ended May 1, up sharply from the $5.9 million it earned in the period a year ago.

A Kohlberg Kravis European affiliate reported earlier this week that its investment in Dollar General had increased in value by $116.2 million for the quarter, with its valuation nearly double the affiliate’s cost.
564 2009-08-21 A state court judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit against SAC Capital Advisors, the hedge fund run by Steven A. Cohen, that accused the firm and others of conspiring to drive down shares of the Canadian drug company Biovail.

Judge Donald S. Goldman of the Superior Court of New Jersey dismissed the suit, filed by Biovail in 2006, saying that the court lacked jurisdiction. He also ruled that Biovail had failed to prove that it was entitled to any damages even if the claims had been true. In a 52-page opinion, Judge Goldman said he had not evaluated the merit of Biovail’s claims against SAC and the research firm Gradient Analytics.

Biovail’s lawsuit, initially filed under civil racketeering laws but later changed to a trade libel suit, accused SAC of colluding with independent firms and analysts at big banks to produce purposely misleading research intended to drive down Biovail’s share price. SAC and other hedge funds had bet against the company’s shares and profited when the stock price dropped.

The dismissal follows a similar decision in February by Judge Stanley R. Chesler of the Federal District Court in New Jersey, which threw out a similar lawsuit against SAC filed by several Biovail shareholders. In that decision, Judge Chesler wrote that Biovail had violated numerous ethics rules including by ghostwriting the shareholder lawsuit in order to obtain documents and other materials that could be used in the racketeering case.

The factual allegations of the suit had “a tainted origin” and were incompatible with admissions by Biovail that it was involved in a kickback scheme and made false statements that inflated its stock price, Judge Chesler wrote.

Dismissal of the two lawsuits is a vindication for SAC and Mr. Cohen, who were publicly accused of manipulating stocks for their own benefit. This year, Biovail paid $128 million in damages to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of making material misrepresentations and omissions in its financial and public statements.
565 2009-08-21 Last fall the main Philadelphia lodge finished redoing its turreted roof, granite exterior, murals of woodlands and an early 1800s flag. The public now enters via the forbidding 17-foot-tall front doorway, formerly accessible to Freemasons only.

In Washington, Masons are overhauling a pyramidal building based on a Greek mausoleum while planning new galleries for videos and displays of “magnificent regalia,” said Arturo de Hoyos, the group’s archivist. He added, “We want to create a coherent presentation on the origins, development and meaning of Freemasonry.”

As curators bring dusty Masonic objects out of storage and acquire new ones, docents are explaining the symbolism to noninitiates, men and women. (Many lodges now have Web sites announcing tour times and some even offer 360-degree views of the interiors.)

At 71 West 23rd Street in Manhattan, officially called the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, guides now point out the library’s modern copy of a 1308 transcript from papal heresy interrogations of Knights Templar and to a meeting hall’s portrait of a black man in a fur anorak; he’s Matthew Henson, a Freemason, who accompanied Robert Peary on Arctic expeditions.

The Massachusetts Masons own so many artifacts — about 12,000 at last count — that in the last few years they have lent them to the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Mass. Through Oct. 25 highlights of the lodge treasury are on view at the museum, including a gold urn and silver ladle by Paul Revere. (In the 1790s, he was the group’s most worshipful grand master.) A show opening Sept. 26 will survey anti-Masonic screeds from the last three centuries that accuse members of plotting against royalty or propping up Communism.

“There will always be people who are suspicious” of Freemasons, Mr. de Hoyos said. “But even if we’re mentioned negatively, that gets people asking questions and coming here. It opens doors.”

Ninety feet of cornfield murals, which Grant Wood painted at an Iowa hotel ballroom in 1927, are being reassembled. Torn out and scattered in 1970, the canvas vistas of bundled cornstalks, wooden fences and farm buildings have been found in attics and offices all over the state.

“This is like putting Humpty Dumpty back together again,” said Laural Ronk, the executive director of the Bluffs Arts Council in Council Bluffs, where the former Hotel Chieftain, now converted into apartments for the elderly, contained the pastoral ballroom. The arts council has located 29 mural segments so far; the nine that it has acquired are being sent for treatment to the Gerald R. Ford Conservation Center, a division of the Nebraska State Historical Society in Omaha. Reattaching loose paint and preparing the canvases for storage, among other repairs, will cost about $120,000.

A few mural sections are temporarily stored at Ms. Ronk’s home and her office. “One is folded and shrink-wrapped, and we’re afraid to even open it,” she said. “I’ve been collecting any flakes that fall off.”

The arts council has been contacting government officials about potential display spaces for the restored landscape. “This could be an icon for our community, and a tourism draw,” she said. “We’d like to be added to the Grant Wood trail.”

Few parts of the White House interior actually date back to its early 19th century origins. Harry S. Truman’s chief architect for renovations, Lorenzo S. Winslow, gutted the place, reinforced it with concrete and then installed new crown moldings, fluted columns and carved eagles, stars and shields. The house turned into an “eerie modernized avatar” of its former self, Ulysses Grant Dietz and Sam Watters write in a history due next month, “Dream House: The White House as an American Home” (Acanthus Press).

Evidence of Winslow’s heavy-handed approach will be for sale on Thursday at James D. Julia Auctioneers in Fairfield, Me. One lot, estimated to bring $12,000 to $16,000, contains 23 drawings from Winslow’s office for new reception rooms, staircases, corridors and family gathering spaces. Owned by an unidentified consignor in Maine, the pages are three or four feet long, and their ripped edges and handwritten measurement notations suggest they were used at the construction site.

William G. Allman, the White House curator, said workmen in the 1950s probably took home many such drawings as souvenirs. “I don’t think,” he said, “there was an official policy, the kind there would be from the Secret Service today, that something like this could not leave the premises.”
566 2009-08-21 “The Baader Meinhof Complex,” a taut, unnerving, forcefully unromantic fictional film about a West German terrorist group whose founders ran bloodily amok in the 1970s, opens with a bright, sparkling image of children playing on a beach. It’s 1967, and two of the children are the twin daughters of Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck), a respected journalist who one day jumped out of a window while helping a prisoner, Andreas Baader (Moritz Bleibtreu), escape. The moment she jumped, Meinhof left her world behind for a life of revolutionary zealotry and nihilistic violence. She traded her typewriter for a gun, her children too.

What spurred Meinhof to leap into the void? That question haunts “The Baader Meinhof Complex,” which Bernd Eichinger adapted from Stefan Aust’s book of the same title. For the most part, relying heavily on the historical record, Mr. Eichinger lets the group do its own talking, as does the film’s director, Uli Edel, who gives it the pulse and music of a thriller. (The propulsive score echoes those of the “Bourne” movies.) This probably accounts for why some have accused the film of glamorizing terrorism, which misses the point that all terrorism is performative. What it does show, from the inside out, is how a group of people graduated from theoretical debates to guns, from hanging up a photo of Che to embracing revolutionary martyrdom.

Written in information-packed bursts, Mr. Aust’s book owes much of its power to its exacting detail and to his familiarity with the group, which self-importantly labeled itself the Red Army Faction. A journalist, he wrote for the leftist newspaper co-founded by Meinhof’s husband, for which she was a columnist and had extolled the “progressive” virtues of arson. Mr. Aust, who shows up at the edges of the film, played by Volker Bruch, helped rescue her children, whom she had handed off to minders while she was on the run. Ceding to pressure from the group, she had agreed that the girls could be taken to a Palestinian orphanage in Jordan where, Mr. Aust writes, they were to be raised as guerrillas.

The members of the faction might have been lousy parents but they were committed to not repeating the sins of their own fathers and mothers. “I really see no difference left,” Meinhof wrote before the faction formed, “between the police terrorist methods we have already seen in Berlin, and that threaten us now, and the terrorism of the SA” — the Nazi Sturmabteilung or storm troopers — “in the 1930s.” For the Red Army Faction the enemies included American imperialism and what it saw as an emerging West German police state: in May 1972 it bombed a police station, a newspaper and several United States Army sites. It also set off a bomb inside a Volkswagen owned by a judge. That morning, however, it was his wife who turned the ignition key. She lived.

The filmmakers lay out the historical and political context in which the faction took root — in an early scene the police beat unarmed demonstrators protesting a visit by the shah of Iran and his wife — but they don’t try to dig deeply into the heads of the group’s individual members. Instead of trying to put the faction on the couch, as an American might, they suggest how the political converged with the personal against a global backdrop of social protest movements, political assassinations and increasingly repressive state reactions. They also offer plenty of proof that some in the group, particularly Baader, got off on the thrill of it all. Having sex and shooting, he once said without evident irony, are the same.

Meinhof, played by Ms. Gedeck as something of a mouse itching to roar, doesn’t come off as an obvious guerrilla. In one scene, though, you see the woman she was and her tremors of discontent. It’s early still, before her great leap, and she’s in her backyard with friends, dancing and laughing and mingling. Her husband quiets the crowd and asks Meinhof to read her latest column, which has been reprinted on a flier. Casting shy smiles at the partyers, she reads a passionate open letter of protest to the shah’s wife, ticking off various outrages, including the torture of Iranian dissidents. As she finishes reading, the film cuts to a long shot that frames Meinhof against the large, stately middle-class house she will soon abandon.
567 2009-08-21 Still, Mr. West nails the big decisions, starting with the casting of the lead roles. As Kate Montgomery, the woman at the center of the love triangle, Cristen Paige delivers songs like “Walk Away” and “Big Trouble” with precision and power, and Mr. Hanlon turns a goofy tune about salesmanship, “Gawk, Tousle and Shucks,” into a delight. These winning actors display something that in the context of contemporary musical theater seems almost quaint: real personality.

The Fringe is famously full of land mines for theatergoers, but with a little guidance you can avoid them. To generalize about the festival can be dangerous, since there is usually an exception to every sweeping claim. Yet the menu of productions could be boiled down to three categories: musicals, solo shows and everything else.

The musicals generally have performers with the most impressive credits and blatant commercial ambitions. “Vote,” an attack of gee-whiz glee wrapped around a story about a high school election, is typical: full of verve, a few well-trained voices and a heavy touch. The modesty of “Dow Jones” is the exception.

The solo, however, is the most consistently enjoyable form, in part because you don’t need to be a superior actor to tell a gripping story about your life; being rough around the edges can even be an asset. Michael Schlitt, for instance, is no natural performer, but his intense stage persona in “Jesus Ride” suits his purposes.

I could be wrong, but it seems as if he’s really playing himself. Wearing sneakers and a casual shirt, he is a certain type of Jewish neurotic that anyone who has spent time in Hollywood will recognize, more Albert Brooks than Woody Allen. In short bursts of grumpy narrative he describes being a secular Jew working for a Hollywood studio on a new movie about Jesus, “The Revolutionary,” which opened at a Christian theme park in Tennessee.

Besides the divine absurdity of this culture-clashing soap opera, the pleasures of “Jesus Ride” include a lively filmic history of movies about the Gospels. Mr. Schlitt has a surprising soft spot for Mel Gibson’s “Passion of the Christ” and a convincing argument for its success: essentially, it’s the “Dirty Harry” of Jesus movies.

We also see clips from “The Revolutionary,” which looks so ludicrously awful that with the right marketing (this show is a good start) it could become a cult hit that joins “Plan 9 from Outer Space” and “Battlefield Earth” as a contender for the worst movie of all time. My favorite detail: There are only 11 apostles, since one was fired and no one bothered to replace him.

“The Event” is the work of someone who knows the conventions of the Fringe solo play so well that he doesn’t have to follow them. Its playwright, John Clancy, helped found the festival, so he has seen his share of indulgent memoir plays. This isn’t one of them.

It begins with an actor (played with easy grace by Matt Oberg) describing components of the theater in a clinical way that makes the ordinary seem strange. He outlines his job (memorizing lines, repeating them), describes how actors maintain friendships with other actors by seeing their shows and lying to one another about them and emphasizes the oddness of doing a job that requires you to follow the same script every night.

It’s a funny if familiar exercise in meta that once again dismantles the artifice of theater. Then Mr. Clancy makes his move, pivoting from a meditation about theater to larger questions of autonomy in a world where the possibility of choice can be an illusion. Stuck with the barest control over his fate, the poor actor, the playwright implies, is not so different from the rest of us.

Leading the Everything Else category is “Powerhouse,” a fascinating bio-play with puppets about the obsessive vision of the musical innovator Raymond Scott (who dreamed up many of the sounds used in Looney Tunes cartoons). It breathes fresh life into the old idea that what makes someone a great artist can be the same thing that makes him a less-than-great person.

The gleeful portrait lacks the brooding darkness of the haunting new work by Mac Rogers, “Viral,” about three lost souls sexually aroused by the idea of filming someone’s death. When they find a willing star, the play becomes about the eerie banality of staging and distributing the gruesome film.

The drama, which seems better upon reflection, first seems stilted, and audience members guffawed at moments that, to me, seemed deeply melancholy. But their response may in part be because the play generates unease and anxiety without providing any release for it. It’s like a horror movie without the shocks. At some point you almost have to laugh.

For all the Fringe’s reputation as a motley collection of offbeat shows, you are more likely to see a conventional well-made play there than a wildly experimental drama. “Notes on the Land of Earthquake & Fire,” a clunkily titled new work by Jason Schafer (“Trick”), is one of the more satisfying examples, a sharp and cynical exploration of the intersection of power and sex in the movie business, told from the perspective of Chad (Ian Scott McGregor), a long-suffering gay assistant to a studio executive. His fortunes appear to change when, while he is baby-sitting for his boss’s daughter, a flirtatious producer named Shane enters the scene, promising a new life.

Mr. Schafer, who also directs, gave the role of Shane to Chad Lindsey, most famous for rescuing a man who fell onto the Penn Station subway tracks in March, earning deservedly fawning press coverage. That he is handsome and young didn’t hurt. In the play his self-involved character repeatedly tells Chad he wants to save him and also commits a dangerous act of self-sacrifice.

As gimmick casting, this is very savvy, but that’s not all it is. Mr. Lindsey, who would probably get flattering reviews no matter what, proves himself to be a pretty nimble, charismatic actor — and that he takes off his clothes, following unofficial Fringe protocol, won’t keep audiences away.
568 2009-08-21 At midmorning it felt like fall when we reached Dana Lake, a barren pond at the bottom of a rocky glacial valley. We hiked to the edge of Dana Glacier, one of about 100 glaciers remaining in the Sierra. They were most likely formed during the Little Ice Age, from about 1450 to 1850. Photographic records show that Dana Glacier has shrunk to one-third the size it was in 1883 and is continuing to recede with climate change.

Connie Millar, a research scientist with the United States Forest Service, said ice climbing at Dana Couloir, above the glacier, could disappear within a couple of decades if temperatures continued their warming trend.

The glacier at the base of the couloir was cut with crevasses, so we put on crampons and harnesses and roped up for safety. The going seemed easy for Mr. Wedberg, who has twice summited Mt. Everest, but I stumbled. Mr. Wedberg had me short-roped, and he quickly stopped my fall with a tug of the rope and only his body weight.

As we scrambled across the bergschrund, the rocky gap between glacier and mountain, Mr. Wedberg set up the first of six climbing anchors by threading three hollow steel ice screws into the ice at the base of the couloir and connecting them with rope, creating a secure anchor. I tied into the anchor and watched as Mr. Wedberg kicked and picked his way up the couloir, two 200-foot-long ropes snaking behind him.

Ms. Berghoff belayed him with one of the ropes passed through a device on her harness, ready to arrest a fall. When he had nearly reached the end of the rope, he stopped climbing and set up a second anchor. It was my turn to follow on one of the ropes.

Breathing hard in the thin air, I alternated hammering one of the tools into the ice and then kicking in the points of a crampon. It was like a sunny winter’s day. I followed a darker ribbon of ice gleaming in the snow, protected against a fall by the rope as Mr. Wedberg belayed me from above.

Then it was Ms. Berghoff’s turn to climb on the second rope after disassembling the first anchor. When she reached us, she passed the ice screws back to Mr. Wedberg for the next anchor. As the sun rose higher rocks the size of grapefruit, loosened by the melting snow and ice, whizzed down the left side of the couloir.

The couloir, nearly as high as the top floor of the Empire State Building, hadn’t seemed so imposing at the base. Now it stretched out far below us. It wasn’t hard to imagine slipping and tumbling forever like a rag doll, and I was glad for the rope’s protection. We could see the deep, almost tropical, blues and greens of Dana Lake far below us.

The last hour of climbing was a boulder-hopping exercise along the bare, brown shoulder of the mountain. When we finally reached the summit, a jumble of fractured gray rocks, we had a 360-degree view that included much of Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada and Mono Lake and the Wassuk Range in Nevada to the east.

Summer had returned on the sunny southern side of the mountain as we soon started down a hikers’ trail. Our long descent zigzagged down across talus fields of brown rock, then through meadows, finally ending near the eastern entrance station to Yosemite National Park. The early evening alpenglow lighted the mountains above us as we walked along the roadway back to our cars. I was bone tired but happy to have experienced a year of seasons in one summer’s day.
569 2009-08-21 BEIJING — China’s military launched a long-promised strategic assault Thursday on its skeptics and detractors, a globe-spanning offensive powered not by arms, but entirely by charm.

The weapon was the Defense Ministry’s new Web site, its sharp home page topped by a photograph of a winding Great Wall and studded below with links to military news, video and photographs. The lead item on Thursday dealt not with missiles or troops, but with President Hu Jintao’s expressions of sympathy to Taiwan, which is believed to have lost more than 500 lives this month to a typhoon.

The site, which has Chinese and English versions, is another step by China’s famously secretive armed forces to give outsiders a peek at their operations, or at least the view they want to offer. The ministry named a press spokesman only last year; last month the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., bused journalists to a base near Beijing for an afternoon of watching soldiers fire mortars and conduct mock counterterrorism operations.

A notice about the Web site said it was intended to give outsiders a better understanding of China’s defense policies, improve cooperation with foreigners and “display before the world the fine image of the P.L.A. as a mighty, civilized and peaceful force.”

The contents range from ordinary news (“Chinese Navy fights pirates”) to background material (“Thirty years of reform and development”) to carefully phrased opinion (“Sino-foreign military exchange and co-op boosts regional stability”).
570 2009-08-21 Wall Street rose on Thursday, even as signs of continuing weakness in the job market sapped some of the momentum from big gains in overseas trading.

Financial shares led the way higher on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 70.89 points, or 0.76 percent, to close at 9,350.05, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 10.91 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,007.37. The Nasdaq was 1 percent higher, at 1,989.22.

Investors snapped up shares of major banks like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, betting that the financial sector would continue to heal as the economy bottomed out. And shares of the struggling insurance giant American International Group rose 21 percent, to $32.30, on news reports that the company believed it could repay its bailout money.

The coffee chain Starbucks edged up 0.5 percent after it announced higher prices for some premium drinks. Shares of fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, also rose.

Futures trading had pointed to bigger gains before a report from the Labor Department showed that weekly unemployment claims rose by 15,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted total of 576,000 new claims. The increase reflected layoffs at manufacturing, finance and trade companies.

574 2009-08-22 The state attorney general, J. B. Van Hollen, said he would not defend a new law that grants same-sex couples spousal benefits like hospital visits and inheritance, saying lawmakers went against voters’ decision not to extend such privileges. Mr. Van Hollen, a Republican, said the state’s Constitution prohibited same-sex couples from holding a legal status that is “substantially similar” to marriage, and said he had concluded that the new domestic partner registry did that. His decision will force the state to hire an outside counsel to defend the law. Gov. James E. Doyle, a Democrat, said: “The attorney general’s job is to represent the state and defend state law when there is a good-faith defense to be made. His representation should not be based on whether he likes the state law.”
575 2009-08-22 Among the biggest attractions for visitors? The morbid curiosity of a financial train wreck.

“This is about the market crashing,” said Lizzie McNeely, 26, a high school teacher from Toronto, as she wandered around the museum one recent afternoon. “I am interested in how they are going to represent that.”

For the $8 price of admission (or free Tuesday to Saturday from 10 to 11 a.m. through October), visitors who have seen enough van Goghs at the Met and Pollocks at the Museum of Modern Art can get a detailed look at the events that brought the global economy to its knees.

The most popular sections of the exhibit, Mr. Kjelleren said, describe so-called toxic assets and how these were exported from America around the world — “As if the rest of the world didn’t already love America enough!” — as well as the dubious role of the ratings agencies in concealing the riskiness of subprime mortgages and the securities based on their values.

A film about the crisis includes a still photograph of Richard S. Fuld Jr., the vilified former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, being harangued by an angry crowd, including a person holding a sign with the word “Crook” scrawled across it.

In curating the installation, Mr. Kjelleren said one of the things he wanted to capture was how “dumb” the banks had been about investment vehicles like credit-default swaps. “It was dumb, it was more than dumb, and it was occasionally reckless and irresponsible,” he said.

He pointed significantly to a section of the exhibit that discussed the so-called Lehman weekend last September, and the government’s decision to allow Lehman Brothers to fail, which Mr. Kjelleren characterized as a big mistake.

But he reminded visitors that the museum was all about learning from past mistakes.

One group striding by — five bankers from Goldman Sachs — seemed more focused on avoiding the educational experience of the exhibit devoted to the credit crisis.

John Cirincion, 60, one of the museum’s volunteer guides, beckoned to them to take a closer look, but the bankers shook their heads.

“We lived it!” one said, as the group headed instead for an exhibit titled “Women in Finance.”

The museum presents the global financial crisis employing a video and a dense timeline that catalogues what Mr. Kjelleren breathlessly describes as what may have been “the most challenging man-made calamity in modern experience,” excluding wars.

The color-coded timeline depicts crucial events from February 2007 through March 2009 in presenting an overview of the crisis, and provides definitions for important financial terms like subprime mortgage.

Mr. Kjelleren, a former banker for JPMorgan, said, “The idea was to create an awareness of the nature of the driving forces that affected everybody’s lives.”

One of the best measures of the scale of the crisis is not on display, but can be found in museum literature detailing its corporate sponsorships.

Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo generously opened their wallets here a year ago, long before they became part of Exhibit A in a display on the financial crisis.

And Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch are effectively gone, and American International Group is a shadow of its former self. The government owns nearly 80 percent of that company.

Alina Sichevaya, an 11-year-old whose father works for Credit Suisse, had just completed a weeklong finance camp for children at a Camp Millionaire program in her hometown of Cary, N.C. She strode into the gilded halls of the museum and made a beeline for the credit exhibit, staring intently at the giant panels of color-coded cards.

Though she had just learned at camp about complicated concepts like taxes and depreciating assets, Ms. Sichevaya said she found the exhibit “kind of confusing.”

“It’s a lot of information,” she added, as she and her mother, Olga, headed off to catch a sightseeing tour of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Even in the best of times, it was never going to be easy to curate an homage to high finance.
576 2009-08-22 Nick Pucciarelli knocked in four runs with a home run and a two-run triple, Angelo Navetta struck out nine in five-plus innings, and Staten Island defeated Mercer Island, Wash., 10-2, on Friday in the opening game of the Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pa.

James Morisano broke a scoreless tie in the third with a run-scoring single, and Pucciarelli followed with a homer to right field for a 3-0 lead.

Staten Island (1-0) added four runs in the fourth, helped by Pucciarelli’s triple.

Navetta took a shutout into the fifth before Washington (0-1) scored on a double by Michael Bantle. Navetta left with one out in the sixth when he reached his 85-pitch limit.

The former Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina, who is a member of the Little League board of directors, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg attended the game.

“I don’t know how to break this for you, but they did not ask my advice on whether the shortstop should play a little bit over, or to bring in the right fielder,” Bloomberg said, drawing chuckles. “I’m going to let them do it on their own.”

TAIWAN ROUTS GERMANY Yu Chieh Kao and Wen Hua Sung each hit three-run homers, four pitchers combined for a no-hitter, and Taoyuan, Taiwan, beat Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, 16-0. Chin Ou added three hits and three runs batted in for Taiwan in a game shortened to four innings because of the mercy rule.
577 2009-08-22 Mr. Ahmadinejad and his allies have failed to silence the critics or even to present a veneer of political unity since the election, and each week seems to bring a new chapter in the worst political crisis to confront Iran since its revolution in 1979. On Friday, the head of Iran’s powerful Guardian Council called for the arrest of the leaders of the protests that swept the nation after the election.

In a fiery and combative speech at a Friday Prayer ceremony in Tehran, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati argued that justice demanded the arrest of the leaders, not only the rank and file. He never explicitly named Mir Hussein Moussavi or Mehdi Karroubi, the two presidential candidates who have led the protests. But it was clear whom he meant.

“Implementing justice is not easy when you have to grab the throats of the bigwigs, and they should be confronted first,” Ayatollah Jannati said from the stage in a stadium-size prayer hall at Tehran University. “Otherwise, it is easy to confront petty thieves and nobodies.”

It was not the first time that a high-ranking official had called for the arrest of the two men, who have refused to back down from the charges that Mr. Ahmadinejad and his allies stole the election through fraud and vote rigging. But by not naming names, it was unclear if Ayatollah Jannati was trying to prepare public opinion for the eventual arrests, or if he was holding back to avoid pushing the country deeper into crisis.

“What is true is the unprecedented degree of internal divisions,” said a Western diplomat who worked in Iran for years but asked not to be identified, in accordance with diplomatic protocol. “Yet, because the regime itself has taken stock of the danger, all the different players are refraining from pushing things toward a real crisis.”

In his speech, Ayatollah Jannati, a close ally of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, asked judicial officials why so many people had been arrested but not those who led them. Since the election, thousands of protesters and opposition figures have been taken into custody. While most have been released, the state has begun three mass trials in which former high-ranking officials, journalists and intellectuals have been paraded into courtrooms in pajamas and accused of helping to promote the overthrow of the government through a velvet revolution.

“The recent riots and disturbances were an injustice against Islam and the revolution and the nation and people’s regime was targeted,” Ayatollah Jannati said. “Some were arrested in these events, but those who were behind this calamity and had led it were not arrested.”

In the days since the contested election and the ensuing government crackdown, Mr. Moussavi has kept a relatively low profile, communicating mostly through his Web site and surrogates. Mr. Karroubi, a cleric who was an early supporter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic republic, has emerged as the most aggressive critic of the system. He made public charges that men and women arrested during the protests were being raped in prisons — charges the state has noy yet fully addressed or silenced.

At the same time, the leadership, including the political and clerical elite, finds itself increasingly divided into competing camps. Parliament is scheduled to consider the cabinet nominations on Sunday. But that matter may prove to be more easily handled than the charges of prison rape.

Addressing the Islamic Society of Engineers this week, Ali Larijani, the speaker of Parliament, eased off his initial insistence that the rape charges were unfounded.

“I announced that they submit evidence if any relevant documents are available,” Mr. Larijani told the engineers society. “If Mr. Karroubi is willing, we will listen to him.”
578 2009-08-22 The News Corporation is in talks to sell its Dow Jones stock market index business, potentially separating the famous Dow Jones industrial average from The Wall Street Journal, the newspaper that has long controlled it, according to people briefed on the matter.

A leading contender to buy the business is MSCI Incorporated, a former Morgan Stanley unit that also builds indexes, one of these people said. It was not clear when a deal would be struck, and the talks may not lead to a transaction.

Dow Jones retained Goldman Sachs to run the sales process, said these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Representatives for Dow Jones, Goldman Sachs and MSCI declined to comment.

The managing editor of The Journal has traditionally chosen which 30 stocks are included in the Dow Jones industrial average. It is not clear whether that relationship, or the name of the index, wound continue under new ownership.

Dow Jones Indexes publishes thousands of indexes, including broad samplings of national and continental stock markets, and gauges of smaller national stock markets, specific industries’ stocks, hedge funds, bonds and even specific commodities in specific parts of the world.

Financial professionals pay for the information, and it is a lucrative business, though News Corporation has not released figures.
579 2009-08-22 Apple said that it had not discussed the Google Voice application with AT&T and that in most cases its contract with the wireless carrier gave it the sole authority to decide whether to accept applications. Apple did say that it had agreed not to allow any applications that sent voice calls over the Internet, bypassing AT&T’s network, without the phone company’s permission. As a result, applications for voice calling services, like eBay’s Skype, can be used only on Wi-Fi connections, not on AT&T’s network. The Google Voice application does not send calls over the Internet. Rather, Google’s servers connect to both parties in the call over the telephone network.

AT&T filed its own letter, asserting that it was not consulted by Apple on the Google voice application. It defended the restriction on voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP, service as important to preserving the revenue it needed to offset the subsidized price of the iPhone. Apple and AT&T, it said, “required assurances that the revenues from the AT&T voice plans available to iPhone customers would not be reduced by enabling VoIP calling functionality on the iPhone.”

Other wireless carriers, including Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, do not have restrictions on applications that make calls over the Internet using their smartphones. And in its letter to the commission, AT&T said it would now reconsider this policy.

The commission is examining Internet calling in response to a complaint by Skype that wireless companies are blocking its service from some handsets.

The question of Internet calling and more broadly, whether wireless carriers and handset makers should exercise control over the applications that run on phones, may well play a part in a broad F.C.C. inquiry that is expected to be approved at its Aug. 27 meeting. This is seen as a move by the new commission chairman, Julius Genachowski, to look at the power of AT&T and Verizon, which together control 60 percent of the wireless business in the United States.

In Google’s letter to the commission, it said it did not screen applications for its Android cellphone operating system, but that it did reject apps that contained pornography or other objectionable material.
580 2009-08-22 Even laced with caveats, his remarks helped to inflate an already buoyant mood on Wall Street, where stocks rose at the opening and pushed higher through the day.

The Dow Jones average rose 155.91 points, or 1.67 percent, to 9,505.96, its highest close since Nov. 4, and the S.& P. 500 was up 18.76 points, or 1.86 percent, at 1,026.13, reaching its highest level since early October.

Shares were higher in Europe but sharply lower in Asia. In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 1.4 percent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 0.64 percent. The FTSE 100 in London rose 2 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt gained 2.9 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 3.2 percent.

Prices of oil, copper and gold all rose, with crude oil rising 92 cents, to $73.83 a barrel, in New York, the highest closing price of the year. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips closed higher.

Interest rates were higher. The price of the Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 1 4/32, to 100 16/32, and the yield rose to 3.56 percent, from 3.43 percent late Thursday.

Shares of industrial companies, energy producers and manufacturers of chemicals, plastics and other basic materials led the markets as traders bet that a global rebound would revive the construction industry and get factories back to full production.

The heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar gained nearly 4 percent, the most among the Dow’s 30 blue-chip stocks.

Shares of major home builders surged after the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes rose 7.2 percent in July.

While forecasters had been expecting home sales to grow for the month, the size of the increase surprised investors and economists. It was the largest monthly gain since the group began tracking existing home sales in 1999.

“I’m a little bit flabbergasted,” said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “These are really good numbers.”

Moreover, home sales last month were 5 percent higher than in July 2008. Homes were selling at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.2 million in July, up from a rate of 5 million a year earlier.

It was the first year-over-year increase in home sales since November 2005.

Potential buyers who abandoned the housing market last year as credit was choked off and prices tumbled are beginning to return, enticed by lower prices in some markets and tax incentives for first-time home buyers.

But some housing analysts warned that sales could ebb as more distressed homes flood onto the market, and when the government’s $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers expires at the end of the year. If unemployment keeps rising, some potential buyers will be unable to enter the market.

“The data today was really good, and it’s wonderful, but how sustainable is it?” said David M. Klaskin, chief investment officer at Oak Ridge Investments. “The real big risk is that you don’t get a sustainable recovery, that the recovery doesn’t get legs under it.”

Over all, economists said, Friday’s numbers offered another signal that the housing market was climbing out of the basement, even as foreclosures and delinquencies crept higher amid rising job losses.

Sales of existing homes — which make up the bulk of home sales — have risen over the last four months.

The median sale price of homes nationwide fell to $178,400, and more homes poured onto the market as foreclosures increased and sellers detected a hint of enthusiasm among buyers.

“The housing market has decisively turned for the better,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors’ association, said in a statement.

588 2009-08-23 BRIDGEVILLE, Pa. (AP) — Members in workout gear holding water bottles and towels quietly returned on Saturday to a health club where a gunman killed three women on Aug. 4.

Workers inside the club, LA Fitness, took down white plastic sheeting behind the glass front doors before unlocking them, opening the club for the first time since the shooting.

“This is a happy, nice place,” said Dorrine Green of Upper St. Clair, “and I think it’s important that we come back because things like that can’t control our lives.” Ms. Green was one of about 15 people waiting at the club when it opened at 8 a.m.

Many were looking forward to getting back to their normal routine, which was interrupted the night the gunman, George Sodini, entered the club.

Mr. Sodini, a 48-year-old computer analyst, killed three women and injured nine others in a Latin dance class before killing himself.

In the days after the shooting, the police tape that had cordoned off the club was replaced by a small makeshift memorial of flowers and notes.

Before the doors opened Saturday, a club worker removed two teddy bears, a bouquet and a note left at the front door and placed them in a grassy area next to the club filled with signs and cards.
589 2009-08-23 As Jan Brady might say, Woodstock, Woodstock, Woodstock! That singular countercultural moment, like a big sister Marcia, is hoarding all the attention here in late August 2009. And with the new Ang Lee movie on the subject out this week, yet more light from the lava lamp is bound to spill on it.

But whiny Jan would have a point. It’s time to share. Other events can cast our minds back 40 years and stake some claim to our younger hearts. There was, after all, a culture as well as a counterculture. Jan herself, whose pre-teenage character was born in late summer 1969 with the television debut of “The Brady Bunch,” might be more inclined to obsess over the astonishing public musings of Mark Lester on NBC’s “Today” on Friday than the latest anniversary of Woodstock. Mr. Lester, we were jolted into reminiscing, played the world’s most famous orphan in “Oliver!,” the movie musical that won the Oscar for best picture in 1969. He has now introduced the notion that he might, conceivably, be the sperm-donator dad of the orphaned daughter of his friend Michael Jackson, who as part of the Jackson Five signed with Motown in 1969.

Then, too, the underappreciated Jan might truly be absorbed by the debut last week of the Archie Comics issue in which Archie has forsworn Nice Girl Betty and proposed to Mean Girl Veronica. The Archies’ “Sugar, Sugar” was the top-selling single of 1969; not a thrashing guitar could be heard.

There. It’s not so hard to conjure other cultural touchstones from 1969. But what these mostly unremarked ones have in common is that they draw from an entirely different well of bottomless boomer nostalgia.

Jan Brady, you see, is among the nearly 45 million Americans ages 45 to 54 who form a tag-along cohort to their big brothers and sisters. They are the babiest of the boomers, carrying all of the baggage but none of the bragging rights of their generation. No draft numbers or Hendrix for them. Marches and moon walks were past their bedtime. Jan was not burning her training bra. And yet they are lumped together with the 78 million or so citizens born between 1946 and 1964 who as a giant oxygen-sucking mass are supposedly going to bankrupt Social Security and otherwise leave the world (taking their sweet time) a place of vastly diminished resources, expectations and dreams.

So where does this accident of demographics put the boomer laggards, who with their standard-bearer Barack Obama see the cultural touchstones of the generation as shared history but not shared experience? Secretly treasuring their own touchstones, possibly. These are quite modest, for the most part, and yet they have the distinct advantage of being theirs.
590 2009-08-23 From the essay “Learning From the Beatles” in the book “The Performing Self.”

One of the Beatles’ most appealing qualities is, again, their tendency more to self-parody than to parody of others. The two are of course very close for performers who empathize with all the characters in their songs and whose most conspicuous moments of self-parody occur when they’re emulating someone whose musical style they’d like to master. At such moments their boyishness really does shine forth as a musical virtue: giving themselves almost wholly to an imitation of some performer they admire, their necessary exaggeration of his style makes fun of no one so much as themselves.

From the essay “In Cold Ink” in the collection “Trying It Out in America.”

At the end of “Music for Chameleons,” a collection of journalistic articles that appeared in 1980, he gingerly admitted that though not yet a saint, “I’m an alcoholic. I’m a drug addict. I’m a homosexual. I’m a genius.” This is intolerably cute. Being a drug addict or an alcoholic or a homosexual is his business. When he combines these admissions with a claim to genius, however, it becomes everybody’s business. To put such items in combination makes it legitimate to ask, especially in an age that has recognized the real genius of Jean Genet, why a reputed genius like Capote, so bent in this instance on self-confession, has not had something more to say about a political culture that, by its pietistic hypocritical obsessions with private conduct, manages to direct attention time and again away from the glaringly visible disasters of social and political life. After his heroic confrontation with cold blood in Kansas, Capote retreated to a tree house in Manhattan, there to play literary games for ever smaller and overpublicized stakes. He was more than amply rewarded for his games in his lifetime. But there is no need to pretend any longer that he has earned anything but a minor place in American letters.
591 2009-08-23 To help make ends meet, Mrs. Grillos also does textile design and photography projects, and it helps that her husband has a full-time job.

Others among the unemployed are taking the entrepreneurial route. The most recent Index of Entrepreneurial Activity by the Kauffman Foundation showed a slight uptick of new businesses in 2008 — a full recessionary year — over 2007. An average of 320 Americans out of 100,000 formed a business each month, Kauffman said. What’s more, it found, the patterns “provide some early evidence that ‘necessity’ entrepreneurship is increasing and ‘opportunity’ entrepreneurship is decreasing.”

Accidental or by design, entrepreneurship is on the rise again this year. LegalZoom.com, the online legal document service, says the number of new businesses it helped to form was up 10 percent in the first half of the year, compared with the period a year earlier.

“We were surprised,” says Brian Liu, co-founder and chairman of LegalZoom. “We expected there to be a drastic downtick.”

LegalZoom’s top five areas of incorporation, he says, are real estate, consulting, Internet (including electronic commerce), retail, and construction and contractors.

To be sure, a vast majority of corporate workers who have been laid off since December 2007 have sought another corporate job. After all, starting a business in the worst downturn in decades seems especially risky. Only two-thirds of new small businesses survive at least two years, according to the Small Business Administration. That survival rate falls to 44 percent at four years, and to 31 percent at seven.

The silver lining may be that the survival rate is about the same in expansions and recessions, says Dane Stangler, senior analyst at Kauffman.

WHILE the Internet has made the formation process quick and inexpensive — papers can be filed with LegalZoom, for example, for $149 in addition to state filing fees — the costs of owning a business add up quickly. There are state and local taxes and fees, insurance, salaries and contract pay, overhead, inventory and the like. And these days, lenders are none too generous when it comes to forking over money to new businesses.

These factors, combined with the lack of a steady paycheck, often-inadequate health insurance and the sheer emotional stress of being unemployed, may prevent many people from setting out on their own.

But research on what is known as post-traumatic growth has found that some people become more resilient when faced with adversity, says Shawn Achor, a Harvard researcher. Creativity surges, he says, as they adapt to a new situation.

“Their brain is actually learning at a faster pace than when they are not challenged,” Mr. Achor says. “As a result of this, some individuals, the accidental entrepreneurs, they are the ones who in the midst of crisis actually respond with growth.”

In a report this summer on innovation, Ernst & Young wrote, “Experience shows that entrepreneurs should not give up on start-ups in a down economy.”

Many companies with billion-dollar market capitalizations were started during a recession, the report said, including Starbucks, Intuit and PetSmart.

Research from Kauffman in June found that more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list in 2009 and nearly half of the companies on the Inc. magazine 2008 list were founded during a recession or bear market.

Lynn Zuckerman Gray, 60, hopes to be one of the success stories of this recession. She lost her job at Lehman Brothers almost a year ago, when the firm collapsed. A former chief administrative officer of its global real estate group, she found herself competing with a rising number of job seekers for a dwindling pool of jobs.

Ms. Gray ended up participating in a New York City program, offered in conjunction with the Kauffman Foundation, called FastTrac NewVenture. The program, for employees displaced by the financial crisis, sent Ms. Gray in a direction she never thought she would go: starting an on-campus recruiting company called Campus Scout.

“I guess I had an entrepreneur simmering inside me because I’ve always been very creative,” she says.

The cost has been hundreds of dollars here and there, she says. Still, the reality of her financial situation is daunting. Her severance pay from Lehman ended this month, and she is now eating into her savings. So far, her new venture, Campus Scout, is in start-up mode and does not have any clients.

She says she is going to try to get part-time work, teach university classes and do some freelance writing to generate cash flow so she can keep her business going for at least two years.

IT’S not just ex-corporate workers who have started businesses out of necessity. In February, Jackie Burke, 68, a retired schoolteacher, and her daughter, Jackie McAlister, 38, a schoolteacher on maternity leave, formed the Cup and Saucer Cookie Company in Ocean City, N.J.

“I never in my lifetime thought of owning a business,” Ms. McAlister said, “the economy has forced us to be creative.” And fast-acting. Stocks nosedived in the fall, and so did her mother’s retirement account.

“Mom was crying, and she said, ‘Maybe I can go to Borders to see if they are hiring.’ I said, I’m not going to watch my retired 68-year-old mom, with two knee replacements, go work at Borders. This is not going to happen.”

Instead, Ms. McAlister and her mother brainstormed about starting an Internet business. A claim to fame they both had was making cookies, she said. She did research in January, filed incorporation papers on LegalZoom in February, started a Web site using GoDaddy.com, and by March sold their first cookies.

“It sounds like a crazy idea, but it was out of total necessity,” Ms. McAlister said. “We had to do something.”

Their Internet business is slow, helped mainly through her Facebook friends and local news coverage, she said. They sell about $200 worth on the Internet each month and about $100 at a local cafe each month. They are near to breaking even, Ms. McAlister said.

Even when she returns to school in the fall, she said, they will keep it going. “The experience has been totally worth it,” she said, and has had the added benefit of distracting them from things out of their control, like the stock market.

Entrepreneurs like the McAlisters, Ms. Gray and Mrs. Grillos have been helped by a growing number of companies that cater to the needs of new businesses.

Recently, Mrs. Grillos attended a networking event in San Francisco organized by Outright.com, which offers bookkeeping software, and Network Solutions, a company that helps small businesses start and market on the Web. The companies had specialists on hand to talk about accounting, tax, legal and other issues facing new business owners.

Kevin Reeth, chief executive of Outright, says, “We realized these people, who have had careers and worked for other people most of their professional life, are not at all prepared to go out and become a business owner.”

The companies jointly started a Web site, unintentionalentrepreneur.com, as a resource and embarked on a five-city tour in partnership with local chambers of commerce and Score, the national group of volunteer mentors. Last week, the tour ended in Manhattan, but the hope is that the networking will continue, Mr. Reeth says.

ANOTHER company that is tailoring its services to very small and new businesses is InfoStreet, a maker of Web-based small-business management software. Michael Hart, 53, of Nashville, says InfoStreet recently had the backbone of NewTerraLiving.com, his new online marketplace for eco-friendly goods, up and running very quickly, and at a very affordable cost.

Mr. Hart started his business after he left an electronic publishing company a year ago. He has been living off his savings and now has booked sales on his site. “The significantly lower costs associated with building the technology infrastructure as well as the phenomenon of social network marketing allowed me to jump in,” he says.

So, will all of these new ventures become viable entities, or are they simply résumé builders and time fillers for people temporarily out of work? For Mr. Hart, it is definitely not a path to a cubicle. “If successful, I don’t see myself returning to corporate America,” he says. “If I’m not successful, I would definitely start another company — if my wife doesn’t kill me.”

Mrs. Grillos acknowledges that she is still job-hunting. “It would be great if this became my full-time job and grew that big,” she says of Hambone Designs. “Even if I found one, I would still have this on the side.”

Martha E. Mangelsdorf, author of “Strategies for Successful Career Change,” says job seekers should be careful about spreading their energy too thinly. “Starting an ambitious business is such a consuming endeavor, I think it would be hard to do that and look for a job at the same time,” Ms. Mangelsdorf says.

“You should try to be clear if you’re starting a business that that’s really what you want to do, as opposed to you’re only doing it because you can’t find work elsewhere,” she says.

No matter what, those who become accidental entrepreneurs have a leg up on the competition, according to Mr. Reeth of Outright. “The process of going into business is going to make anybody who tried it better, smarter and more capable,” he says.

“Whether it ultimately ends a successful journey in terms of staying in business and this is what you do or you go back and get another job,” he adds, “the skills they will have to develop are going to serve them very well.”
592 2009-08-23 Emily Lauren Orfinger, a daughter of Marilyn S. Orfinger and Mark P. Orfinger of Ardsley, N.Y., was married Saturday to Steven Joseph Auletta, a son of Gail L. Auletta and Thomas J. Auletta of Ballston Lake, N.Y. Walter Schwartz, the Ardsley village justice, officiated at the Glen Island Harbour Club, an event space in New Rochelle, N.Y.

Mrs. Auletta, 28, and Mr. Auletta, 27, are lawyers working for the City of New York. She is an assistant Manhattan district attorney; he is an assistant corporation counsel. The couple met at Brooklyn Law School, from which they both received law degrees, she cum laude.

The bride graduated from Cornell. Her father is the principal of Mamaroneck High School in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Her mother teaches first grade at the Concord Road Elementary School in Ardsley.

The bridegroom graduated from Siena College in Loudenville, N.Y. His father retired as a science teacher at John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, N.Y.; he and the bridegroom’s mother own Azusa Collectibles in Round Lake, N.Y., a store specializing in stamps and comic books.
593 2009-08-23 Tesmerelna Sunkel Atsbeha and Andrew Philip Mambo are to be married Sunday at Parsons Garden Park in Seattle. The Rev. Sharon Ramey, a minister of the United Centers for Spiritual Living, is to officiate.

The couple both work for the United Nations in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the bride for the United Nations Development Program and the bridegroom for the World Food Program.

Ms. Atsbeha, 31, works with the Tanzanian government in managing H.I.V. and AIDS programs. She is also involved in a second program that encourages the government to ensure that men and women benefit equally from its policies.

She graduated from Brown and received a master’s degree in public health from the University of London. She is the daughter of Donna Sunkel and Negash Atsbeha, both of Seattle.

Mr. Mambo, 32, coordinates the Food for Education program in Tanzania, which provides lunches and snacks in rural schools.

He graduated from Concordia University in Montreal and received a master’s degree in international studies and diplomacy, also from the University of London. He is the son of Sheila Thompson and Philip L. Mambo of Montreal.
594 2009-08-23 Alternatively, Mr. Bloom suggested looking into a relatively new breed of bedbug monitor that uses carbon dioxide, among other come-hithers, to mimic a living, breathing human body and lure the insects to feed. The newest of these, NightWatch, was released in May. The device retails for $649 and must be left in place for two weeks to produce a result that the company says is 99 percent conclusive.

“Put it in the bedroom you plan to sleep in — the bugs can sense it from 90 feet away,” said John Furman of Boot a Pest in West Hempstead, N.Y., an extermination company that does most of its business in New York City.

The device is working so well for clients that he plans to set up a separate leasing program this fall, with units renting for around $200 for a two-week testing period.

Gut renovations are an excellent time to incorporate some bedbug prophylactics.

“When the walls are torn down, try to have an exterminator place a dessicant dust in the walls,” said Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann of the New York State Integrated Pest Management program. “It lasts forever and can provide a sort of barrier.”

For bedbugs, traversing dessicant dust — also known as diatomaceous earth — is equivalent to “crawling across razor wire,” Mr. Bloom explained. The powder cuts open the bugs’ undersides, exposing them to infection and dehydration. Dessicant dust can be ordered online or through a pest management company; Mr. Bloom cautions consumers to order “pesticide grade” rather than “pool grade,” which poses an inhalation danger.

Dessicant dust can be placed in the spaces behind outlets, for example. In addition, floors can be sealed with a thick coat of polyurethane, and sealant caulk can be applied to moldings. Some pest control companies have started marketing these as “exclusion services.”

Once you’ve moved in, you may want to keep to yourself for a while.

“We’ve had several cases where bedbugs spread by social activity between neighbors,” Mr. Bloom said. “So it also matters who you pick as your friends in the building.”
595 2009-08-23 An article last Sunday about George Steel, the general manager and artistic director of the New York City Opera, misidentified the company that commissioned “Esther,” which City Opera is performing this fall. It was the San Francisco Opera, not City Opera. (After the San Francisco Opera dropped the project, City Opera resuscitated it and gave “Esther” its world premiere in 1993.)
596 2009-08-23 LAST month, inside a sprawling new tourist resort on the Montego Bay coast, Tarrus Riley did the near impossible: He and his seven-piece band, anchored by the Jamaican saxophone virtuoso Dean Fraser, transformed an antiseptic, fluorescent-lighted, air-conditioned hotel ballroom into a sweaty reggae dance party. Mr. Riley, a 30-year-old Rastafarian singer-songwriter, was celebrating the imminent release of his third album, “Contagious” (VP Records), a diverse collection of songs that reveal the complexity and richness of a genre often dismissed as monotonous.

“ ‘Contagious’  much better than the swine flu,” said the bearded, spectacle-wearing Mr. Riley with a grin, his green T-shirt darkened with perspiration. “Let us infect you with some of this virus.”

Peter Tosh sang of “Reggae Mylitis” in 1981, diagnosing a pandemic of indigenous Jamaican music spreading around the world. But in the 28 years since the death of Tosh’s band mate Bob Marley, reggae has sought a new standard-bearer. Mr. Riley is hardly the first to throw his hat in the ring, but his name is already being mentioned in the same breath as esteemed vocalists like Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs and Beres Hammond.

Like those singers he possesses an expressive, instantly recognizable voice, as well as a knack for lyrics and melodies that capture the ups and downs of love and life  a new baby whose parents can’t sleep, a husband whose wife’s kisses have gone cold  in a way that is both familiar to his island audience and accessible to the world. He’s also an irrepressibly cheerful personality, constantly cracking jokes in patois, though he could hardly take his work more seriously. His mission, he said in a recent telephone interview from a tour stop in Orlando, Fla., is to “preserve our culture,” by which he means reggae music and the attendant black-empowerment philosophies of Marcus Garvey.

After a long season dominated by a musical war between Vybz Kartel and Mavado that has divided those artists’ young fans, and a radio ban brought on by a slew of songs about daggering, the latest dirty-dancing trend, the dancehall sound that has dominated Jamaican music for the past two decades has become increasingly unintelligible to the rest of the world. Without bashing dancehall Mr. Riley is leading a resurgence of traditional roots reggae, fortified by a rare blend of wisdom, maturity and street cred. His music has become a fixture on the Jamaican reggae charts alongside coarser fare and now seems poised to break into the big time.

”It’s very important that the legacy of the kind of music that Bob Marley started continues,” said Bobby Clarke, the chief executive of Irie Jam Media, a New York reggae radio and concert production company. “Tarrus’s job is to bring original reggae back to the mainstream. And I think he can do it and he will do it because he has great people behind him  and his music is perfect.”

The night after his release party Mr. Riley commanded a much bigger stage at Reggae Sumfest, the annual three-day festival that has made Montego Bay a mandatory stop for the biggest stars in R&B and hip-hop as well as the cream of local talent. This year’s lineup included Ne-Yo, whose recent hit single “Miss Independent” provided the backing track for Vybz Kartel and Spice’s X-rated dancehall smash “Rampin’ Shop,” and a twin bill of Marley’s youngest son, Damian (Jr. Gong) Marley, and the American rap star Nas, who are currently collaborating on an album called “Distant Relatives.”

This largely unheralded cross-cultural conversation between American and Jamaican musicians has been going on for half a century, resulting in, among other things, the creation of ska (by modifying American bebop) and the birth of hip-hop (by transplanting Jamaican sound-system dances to the Bronx). But as these free-flowing stylistic innovations calcified into marketable categories, reggae lost out on the American airwaves. Hip-hop stations might spice up their mix shows with a few dancehall cuts and occasionally add a Sean Paul or Serani hit into rotation, but R&B program directors have been largely content with the reggae dabblings of major-label acts like Estelle and John Legend.

“We don’t like categories,” Mr. Riley said. “ ’Cause then you get the separation and then you get the prejudice. Can’t take all of these boundaries, you know? I just like to make free music. Let me express a song because of what I feel, and make it for everyone.”

Born in the Bronx and raised between Florida and Jamaica, Mr. Riley is the son of the reggae singer Jimmy Riley, a member of seminal 1960s harmony groups like the Techniques and the Uniques. The elder Mr. Riley achieved solo success with the reggae ballad “Love and Devotion,” produced by Sly and Robbie, which hit the British pop charts in 1982.

“Tarrus always gravitated toward music,” Jimmy Riley said backstage at the 2008 edition of Sumfest after sharing the stage with his son. “He learned to play the piano and grew up right there in the midst of things. Most of the veteran singers were friends of mine, so he knew them all.”

But the younger Mr. Riley was a fan of the pop music he heard on the radio as well as reggae. “Everything influence me,” he said. “Rock, R&B  music influences music. I’m a lover of all melody, whatever the melody is.” He grew up admiring dancehall stars like Shabba Ranks and Buju Banton and started his career D.J.-ing (dancehall parlance for rapping), recording his debut single, “Nowadays,” at 15.
597 2009-08-23 DESPITE the Champagne flutes and oversize hats at the Pebble Beach classic-car celebrations last weekend, it was clear that the economy was weighing on collectors.

Five auctions took place in the Monterey area starting on Aug. 13. And while these provide a gauge of the current market, the mixed results make it hard to reach simple conclusions.

As expected, total dollar volume declined — to about $117 million this year from $138 million in 2008. Gooding & Company was again the overall leader with just over $50 million of sales.

But the total amounts that changed hands don’t tell the whole story: overall results were puffed up by sales of high-price cars like a 1965 Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe that brought $7.25 million including buyer’s premium (the weekend’s high sale) at the Mecum Auctions sale; a Ferrari California Spider sold by Gooding for $5.1 million; and a Jaguar C-Type that brought $2.8 million at the RM auction.

A collection of 50 American woodys was also well received, selling for a total of nearly $7.5 million at an RM auction.
598 2009-08-23 David Horowitz, the conservative firebrand, is among those who have seized on the feminist-hawk position. Horowitz may not be an obvious feminist, but as someone who has dedicated his life to political media (producing or contributing to magazines, books, political ads, cable news, talk radio, blogs, video podcasts, even a pamphlet), he’s adroit at adapting ideologies for media platforms. Right now, this one is working for him.

Like many conservatives, Horowitz appears to have come to feminist-hawkism after 9/11. But in his hands, the ideology has fast became a tenacious memebrid — as Tim Hwang, a sociologist and the director of the Web Ecology Project, calls memes that unite two or more cultural phenomena.

“The neat marriage of hawkish tendencies and feminist framing of issues does this quite effectively,” Hwang explained to me in an e-mail message. Borrowing left-wing shibboleths is one way that “conservative ideas can make it big in a generally more liberal online social sphere,” he wrote. Furthermore, to depict Islamic regimes less as terrorists than as repressors of civil liberties may appeal even to traditional isolationists, as it “plays off of the strong communities of libertarians that dominate some prominent spaces.”

Hawkish sites that have taken up feminism include Little Green Footballs, Jihad Watch and Horowitz’s FrontPage Magazine. On a recent day, the home page of the last featured reports of female prisoners being raped in ; prepubescent girls getting married in Gaza; and a possible honor killing by an immigrant in New York. This material is expected to help seal Horowitz’s general case for the war on terror, though he has not yet changed the name of his cause to, say, the war on misogyny.

Would the architects of the original anti-Taliban e-mail petition recognize Horowitz’s crusade as their own? Probably not. Where the original message aimed to engage the United Nations, Horowitz considers the United Nations to be “one-world kleptocrats.” And where at least one version of the chain message reproves Americans for cultural relativism, Horowitz considers his position staunchly American.

As a fan of intensely specific forms of communication — blogs, memoirs, reality TV — I don’t believe that any idea exists apart from its mode of dissemination. But I also know that ideas that seem especially big and irresistible are usually so elegantly integrated with particular communication technologies that it’s hard to conceive of them separately. Could ’s patriotic anti-elitism have coalesced anywhere but on AM radio? Could “family values” have emerged without Christian TV?

And could the feminist-hawk position have emerged without the weird confluences of the Web? Like any wily and surviving creature, this new ideology has faced evolutionary pressures and adapted to its ecological niche.

WEB SLEUTHS “Researching the Internet so you don’t have to,” the Web Ecology Project parses panda-sneeze vids for cultural significance. And don’t miss the other projects of Tim Hwang, including the Internet culture-celebrity conference: .

WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? David Horowitz has spent his life making ideological media. Lots of it. His memoir of how he got to be this way, “Radical Son,” is a riveting read. The site for the David Horowitz Freedom Center shows the range of his projects and the nonrange of his rhetoric (it’s all pitch).

WOMEN OF THE WORLD For feminist hawks, feminist doves and even nonavian feminists, is a one-stop site for the group determined to “end violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world.”

618 2009-08-24 As the 30-year-old son of a man who attended Woodstock in 1969, who has seen his father in the background in documentary videos, I say, please, Boomers, let it go (“ ‘Mad Men’ Crashes Woodstock’s Birthday,” by Frank Rich, column, Aug. 16)!

I don’t commemorate Pearl Jam’s “Ten,” or the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, or any of the peaceful three-day concert festivals I’ve been to over the course of my teenage years and 20s, and neither should you.

Woodstock was a concert, nothing more. It was peaceful. It was fun. The peak of the hippie movement was two years earlier, in San Francisco.

All of the great artists at Woodstock did not need the concert to make them great, and neither did the boomers who attended. Jonathan Carey
619 2009-08-24 Although Wagner’s addition would not affect Papelbon’s role as Boston’s closer, Papelbon still expressed reservations about Wagner on Saturday on the Web site of the Boston sports radio station WEEI. Papelbon was more complimentary toward Wagner on Sunday. But Papelbon ricocheted between saying Wagner would improve the Red Sox and saying he could damage the bullpen’s “dynamic.”

Eventually, Papelbon shifted from behaving like a general manager and stressed how Theo Epstein, Boston’s actual G.M., would ultimately do what was best for the Red Sox.

“That’s a G.M.’s job, to make this team better,” he said. “By acquiring him, it would make our team better.”

Wagner, who has had four operations, including reconstructive elbow surgery last September, returned to the Mets in 11 months. An angry Wagner, who like Papelbon can be talkative, dismissed Papelbon’s questioning of his value.

“I don’t have any thoughts on somebody like him,” said Wagner, who has 385 career saves. “I mean, when he walks in my shoes, then I’ll say something. Let him be 38 and have Tommy John and come back.”

Even before Papelbon and Wagner may become teammates, they have whipped verbal darts at each other. This back-and-forth could make for awkward moments by Tuesday.

Two years ago, the Red Sox had the best record in the majors when they acquired Eric Gagne, another closer, in late July. It was a fiasco. Gagne had a 6.75 earned run average in 20 games and was a bust on a championship team. Papelbon invoked that deal while discussing Wagner.

Regardless of what Papelbon has said, the Red Sox are focused on adding Wagner. Allard Baird, Boston’s assistant general manager, was at Citi Field on Sunday to scout Wagner, who did not pitch in the Philadelphia Phillies’ 9-7 win over the Mets. Baird will probably stay in New York to see if Wagner pitches Monday.

After Sunday’s loss, Boston’s relievers are second in the American League with a 3.66 E.R.A. But the Red Sox bullpen also has a 5.95 E.R.A. in the last 20 games. While Papelbon spoke about the bullpen’s cohesiveness and how they “work well together,” the Red Sox were searching for help because the bullpen has faltered.

The Red Sox have used several relievers as a bridge to Papelbon, mixing and matching with Manny Delcarmen, Daniel Bard, Ramon Ramirez and Okajima. Wagner, whose fastball hit 96 miles per hour when he threw a scoreless inning Thursday, could be another weapon for Francona and protection from an injury to one of Boston’s core relievers.

“It’s a tough decision because, do you disrupt what we have now or do you make it better?” Papelbon said. “It’s a tough decision. I’m glad I don’t have to make it.”

Wagner initially said that he wanted to remain with the Mets for the rest of the season, but he seems excited about relocating to Boston. He attended his first game in Boston, played in the Cape Cod League and said, “I love Boston.”

But will Boston love him? More specifically, will Papelbon welcome Wagner? Papelbon said he would. By Tuesday, there is a strong possibility Papelbon and Wagner will be sitting together in the right-field bullpen at Fenway Park.

“And if that’s what has to happen,” Papelbon said, “then that’s what has to happen.”
620 2009-08-24 The first nominees met Sunday with parliamentary committees, laying out their programs and qualifications, news accounts from Iran said. Those reviews are scheduled to last several days. The full Parliament is scheduled to begin debating and voting on those nominees next Sunday. Leaders in Parliament have indicated that they are likely to reject five or six nominees for lack of proper qualifications.

“He thinks that in order to be a strong president and to prove himself, he needs a cabinet which he can control, and a cabinet which understands his thinking on the ideological level,” said Mustafa Alani, director of security and defense studies at the Gulf Research Center in the United Arab Emirates. “So we’re talking about political loyalty, not quality of ministers.”

In what was widely seen in Iran as a bid to outmaneuver critics, Mr. Ahmadinejad nominated three women to ministry posts, a first since the 1979 revolution. In televised remarks he tried to present his nominations as a sign of change, and challenged the Parliament to elevate women into positions of authority. But his political gambit backfired, angering many constituencies. Clerical leaders and conservatives said that women should not serve as ministers, while even moderates have criticized as unqualified two of the nominees: Fatemeh Ajorloo for welfare and Susan Keshavarz for education.

Mohammad Taghi-Rahbar, head of the largest faction of clerics in Parliament and a member of the conservative majority, told Farda News that senior clerics “have doubts” on grounds of religious jurisprudence about what he called Mr. Ahmadinejad’s “new idea” to appoint female ministers. “I hope that this does not create another crisis between the government and the top clerics,” he was quoted as saying.

Initially hoping to head off parliamentary objections, Mr. Ahmadinejad made a special television address on Thursday in which he said, in effect, that members of Parliament had no place to interfere with the president’s choice of cabinet ministers and that they should not be afraid to appoint women.

Rather than intimidating lawmakers, though, it appears he incited Parliament to assert its authority. On Sunday, the speaker, Ali Larijani, gave what amounted to a rallying call to the legislature to fulfill its constitutional duty as the “center of the Republic.”

“The truth is, you have no doubts about the role” of the Parliament, Mr. Larijani told legislators.

One of the president’s choices may have helped him at home. Argentine officials and Jewish groups have expressed anger over the nomination of Ahmad Vahidi for defense minister; he is wanted by Interpol in connection with the 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires. Eighty-five people were killed and more than 300 wounded.

Iran has denied involvement in the bombing, and Mr. Ahmadinejad’s office said efforts to derail Mr. Vahidi’s nomination were part of a “Zionist plot” to undermine the new administration. Political analysts in Tehran said there were signals that Parliament might now close ranks around Mr. Vahidi.
621 2009-08-24 Democrats, seeing a chance to turn a referendum on an unpopular incumbent into a referendum on a challenger with some holes in his armor, want to talk about nothing else.

“There’s a lot more optimism around Jon Corzine’s candidacy now,” said David Plouffe, President Obama’s campaign manager, who cut his political teeth in New Jersey. “When the real economic questions are put in front of voters, and now you’ve got questions about Christie’s character and ethics, there’s a pathway that’s a little wider. It’s still a tough fight and a little uphill, but there’s a pathway.”

New Jersey is enjoying outsize attention the year after a presidential election because it is one of only two statewide contests in the nation; the other is in Virginia. And New Jersey is still considered far more friendly to Democrats than Virginia is; the party holds a 650,000-vote registration edge, and a Republican has not won statewide in 12 years.

Still, what were once considered Mr. Corzine’s political assets now look a lot like baggage. He is a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs precisely at the high-water mark of revulsion against Wall Street. He is a proponent of expensive health care and prekindergarten programs at a time of growing nervousness about soaring deficits and ambitious spending plans.

Those who have lived through past New Jersey campaigns believe the contest will ultimately be decided on pocketbook issues. Mr. Christie, who spent seven years as a United States attorney, has compiled a withering indictment of the governor: higher taxes, unemployment higher than in New York or Pennsylvania, a business climate rated among the nation’s worst, an exodus of college students and corporations. Mr. Corzine said things would have gotten far worse had he not been in charge. But that is harder to prove, polls show that most voters do not buy it, and Republicans believe many people have run out of patience with the governor.

“There is such Democrat fatigue in this state,” said Kevin O’Toole, the Republican chairman in Essex County, which includes Newark. “Obama’s right, it’s time for a change.”

Worse still, for Democrats, Mr. Corzine has struggled mightily to excite the party’s base. Blacks and Hispanics have openly flirted with Mr. Christie over issues like school vouchers. Environmental advocates have already deserted Mr. Corzine. The Corzine campaign is aggressively lobbying gay men and lesbians to stick with the governor.

Mr. Corzine’s aides had been saying for months that they only needed to fight Mr. Christie to a draw on the subject of corruption, because they believe if the campaign is about the issues, they will win, given the Democrats’ registration advantage. But despite the campaign’s costly barrage of television commercials accusing Mr. Christie of cronyism, his disapproval rating is still only about half the governor’s.

That is why they began to grow excited this month, with the news that Karl Rove had spoken with Mr. Christie, as early as 2006 or 2007, about Mr. Christie’s interest in the New Jersey governor’s office. The Hatch Act bars federal prosecutors from even testing the waters for a candidacy, and by Saturday, Mr. Corzine, speaking to liberal bloggers in Pittsburgh, was calling Mr. Christie a “lawbreaker.”

Some Democrats felt it was a stretch. But then, last Tuesday, another break: Mr. Christie came forward to acknowledge he had given a top aide in the prosecutor’s office a second mortgage to help her out of a financial jam, but failed to report it on his ethics filings and tax returns.

Full of outrage when announcing indictments, Mr. Christie was subdued but frank in owning and apologizing for his mistake. But he had to contend with questions about why his lapse — he had failed to report $420 in interest income on his taxes — would not have been worth prosecuting.

From Washington to Trenton to the governor’s adopted hometown, Hoboken, Mr. Corzine’s allies grabbed hold of the story as if it were a defibrillator.

Aides to Senator Robert Menendez put calls in to reporters pressing the attack. Representative Frank Pallone Jr. accused the United States attorney’s office — where the woman who received the loan from Mr. Christie is now second in command — of playing politics. The Corzine campaign filed a lawsuit seeking records of Mr. Christie’s communications with his old office.

Mr. Christie’s allies watched, agape. Mr. Corzine had once lent more than 10 times as much money to a companion who headed a state workers’ union he later negotiated with. “Corzine could not be more hypocritical than he’s being right now,” said Jennifer Beck, a Republican state senator from Monmouth County.

While some Republicans expressed concern about what they called the sloppiness of Mr. Christie’s mistake, his campaign was confident the matter would blow over. “This is a distraction for this week,” said Russ Schriefer, his media consultant.

“It’s just evidence of how weak their case is, because it’s a nonstory,” said Jay Webber, Mr. Christie’s appointee as state Republican chairman. “All the Democrats have done is played a game of gotcha, and Chris said, ‘Oh, you pointed out a mistake, and I’ve corrected it and moved on.’ That’s what leaders do.”

Mr. Corzine’s aides are hoping otherwise. “The problem for Christie is the New Jersey electorate knows a hypocrite when they see one,” said Maggie Moran, the Corzine campaign manager. “What bona fides does he have to run on now?”

On Friday morning, a select group of county Democratic chairmen gathered in Mr. Corzine’s Hoboken high-rise apartment for breakfast. A week ago, Ms. Moran said, she expected to have to put out fires of discontent. Instead, it was all smiles.

“There’s been a sea change,” said Rich McClellan, the Mercer County chairman, a few hours after the gathering, adding, “There’s a sense that we’re just looking at the start of the unraveling of the Christie mystique.”
622 2009-08-24 Just about everyone, from the general public to news executives, has an opinion about the future of journalism. Now, the Federal Trade Commission is stepping into the debate.

The commission is planning two days of workshops in December — titled “From Town Criers to Bloggers: How Will Journalism Survive the Internet Age?” — to examine the state of the news industry.

More often, the F.T.C. tends to organize workshops related to consumer protection issues like mortgage fraud. But Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, says the agency has taken a look at other industries, through workshops on hospital competition, food marketing and the patent system. Journalism’s future falls in the agency’s purview, he said.

“Competition among news organizations involves more than just price,” Mr. Leibowitz said in an interview.

Disclosure: Mr. Leibowitz is married to Ruth Marcus, an editorial writer at The Washington Post. But he said the commissioners, who are a mix of Democrats and Republicans, are supportive of the workshops.

Though some may be uncomfortable with government oversight of any aspect of journalism, the F.T.C. seems to be “attempting to play a facilitating and public educational role in gathering together various disciplines and perspectives to talk about the crisis in mainstream journalism,” said Neil Henry, a professor and dean at the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. “The government’s willingness to raise the profile of this issue, and to help explain why it is important for a national conversation, I think in general is welcome.”
623 2009-08-24 But Dr. Peter Kilmarx, chief of epidemiology for the division of H.I.V./AIDS prevention at the C.D.C., said that any step that could thwart the spread of H.I.V. must be given serious consideration.

“We have a significant H.I.V. epidemic in this country, and we really need to look carefully at any potential intervention that could be another tool in the toolbox we use to address the epidemic,” Dr. Kilmarx said. “What we’ve heard from our consultants is that there would be a benefit for infants from infant circumcision, and that the benefits outweigh the risks.”

He and other experts acknowledged that although the clinical trials of circumcision in Africa had dramatic results, the effects of circumcision in the United States were likely to be more muted because the disease is less prevalent here, because it spreads through different routes and because the health systems are so disparate as to be incomparable.

Clinical trials in , and found that heterosexual men who were circumcised were up to 60 percent less likely to become infected with H.I.V. over the course of the trials than those who were not circumcised.

There is little to no evidence that circumcision protects men who have sex with men from infection.

Another reason circumcision would have less of an impact in the United States is that some 79 percent of adult American men are already circumcised, public health officials say.

But newborn circumcision rates have dropped in recent decades, to about 65 percent of newborns in 1999 from a high of about 80 percent after World War II, according to C.D.C. figures. And blacks and Hispanics, who have been affected disproportionately by AIDS, are less likely than whites to circumcise their baby boys, according to the agency.

Circumcision rates have fallen in part because the , which sets the guidelines for infant care, does not endorse routine circumcision. Its policy says that circumcision is “not essential to the child’s current well-being,” and as a result, many state programs do not cover the operation.

The academy is revising its guidelines, however, and is likely to do away with the neutral tone in favor of a more encouraging policy stating that circumcision has health benefits even beyond H.I.V. prevention, like reducing urinary tract infections for baby boys, said Dr. Michael Brady, a consultant to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

He said the academy would probably stop short of recommending routine surgery, however. “We do have evidence to suggest there are health benefits, and families should be given an opportunity to know what they are,” he said. But, he said, the value of circumcision for H.I.V. protection in the United States is difficult to assess, adding, “Our biggest struggle is trying to figure out how to understand the true value for Americans.”

Circumcision will be discussed this week at the C.D.C.’s National H.I.V. Prevention Conference in , which will be attended by thousands of health professionals and H.I.V. service providers.

Among the speakers is a physician from Operation Abraham, an organization based in and named after the biblical figure who was circumcised at an advanced age, according to the book of Genesis. The group trains doctors in Africa to perform circumcisions on adult men to reduce the spread of H.I.V.

Members of Intact America, a group that opposes newborn circumcision, have rented mobile billboards that will drive around Atlanta carrying their message that “circumcising babies doesn’t prevent H.I.V.,” said Georganne Chapin, who leads the organization.

Although the group’s members oppose circumcision on broad philosophical and medical grounds, Ms. Chapin argued that the studies in Africa found only that circumcision reduces H.I.V. infection risk, not that it prevents infection. “Men still need to use ,” Ms. Chapin said.

In fact, while the clinical trials in Africa found that circumcision reduced the risk of a man’s acquiring H.I.V., it was not clear whether it would reduce the risk to women from an infected man, several experts said.

“There’s mixed data on that,” Dr. Kilmarx said. But, he said, “If we have a partially successful intervention for men, it will ultimately lower the prevalence of H.I.V. in the population, and ultimately lower the risk to women.”

Circumcision is believed to protect men from infection with H.I.V. because the mucosal tissue of the foreskin is more susceptible to H.I.V. and can be an entry portal for the virus. Observational studies have found that uncircumcised men have higher rates of other like herpes and , and a recent study in found that heterosexual men were less likely to have become infected with H.I.V. from infected partners if they were circumcised.

639 2009-08-25 SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) — Michael Rapaglia struck out seven over four-plus innings and Vincent Quinn hit a three-run homer Monday night for Staten Island, which earned a spot in the United States semifinals at the Little League World Series with an 8-3 victory over Urbandale, Iowa.

Staten Island will play California or Texas on Wednesday.

Rapaglia held the Iowa hitters at bay until the fourth, when he loaded the bases. But he got pinch-hitter Robert Vanderlinden to strike out to escape the jam.

Staten Island scored four runs in the sixth to take an 8-0 lead, with Quinn homering to straightaway center.

Iowa’s Spencer Sturges had a two-run single before reliever James Morisano held on for the final two outs.

In Monday’s other United States division game, the team from Warner Robins, Ga., scored the tying and go-ahead runs on a passed ball and a wild pitch to stay unbeaten with a 3-2 victory over Mercer Island, Wash. Georgia had already qualified for the United States semifinals.

In International division games, teams from Curaçao and Mexico clinched berths in the semifinals. Willemstad, Curaçao, rallied for a 5-3 victory over Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Junters Dossett’s two-run homer in the fifth inning broke a 3-3 tie, and Jardel Martina struck out 11 in five innings.

Reynosa, Mexico, took advantage of seven errors by Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, in a 13-0 victory that ended after four innings because of the 10-run rule.
640 2009-08-25 “F.B.I. Agents’ Role Is Transformed by Terror Fight” (front page, Aug. 19) is a welcome portrayal of life as an F.B.I. agent in the post-9/11 world. The need to put into place a different type of organizational structure to assess and act upon the thousands of threats to ensure the country’s safety in a world where Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda are still on the run should come as little surprise to anyone closely following the fight against terrorists.

But the notion that “just chasing leads burns through resources,” as one university professor put it, is unconvincing. Before 9/11 the F.B.I. did not have at its disposal many of the resources available today in the fight against terror. Still, countless domestic and international terrorism cases ended in indictments and convictions of those responsible for committing cowardly acts of terror against Americans at home and abroad.

During a 29-year career with the F.B.I., I was privileged to lead the federal task force that pursued the Unabomber, Theodore J. Kaczynski, as well as the fugitive task force that hunted for the Olympic bomber Eric Robert Rudolph.

Then, as now, all the technology, computers and theories in the world were no substitute for “chasing leads” and developing relationships and strategies that might offer information of evidentiary value. In fact, critical information developed from leads during the course of these investigations made its way into the indictments and search warrants that led to guilty pleas before trial.

Those of us who have worked in the trenches of the terror war realize that thousands of leads may need to be pursued to find the single piece of information that brings a case to a conclusion. Those of us who have gone to sleep at night knowing that we are accountable for preventing the next terrorist act against America will gladly “chase” 10,000 leads to make sure it doesn’t happen.

The writer is a retired deputy assistant director of the counterterrorism division of the F.B.I.
641 2009-08-25 Nike is ready to depart the soccer business. Not the seemingly recession-proof and lucrative global market for jerseys, shoes and other gear. Instead, Nike has put up for sale its 100 percent ownership of United Soccer Leagues.

U.S.L., the conglomeration of six leagues (with teams in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico), was founded in 1986 and was owned by Umbro, the British sporting goods company, until Nike bought Umbro in 2007 for $582 million. In addition to inheriting Umbro’s role as the uniform supplier for national teams like England and Sweden, and a handful of clubs in the English Premier League, Nike also became the sole owner of U.S.L.

But Nike has decided that being the owner of the league does not fit with its core business.

It just needs to find a buyer. U.S.L. has had a love-hate relationship with Major League Soccer, dating to the formation of M.L.S. in 1996. And although U.S.L. 1 (the league’s first division) was once seen as a perfect fit for M.L.S., whether as a reserve league or as part of a promotion/relegation setup like the ones used in leagues around the world, M.L.S. officials said the league was no longer interested.

“We recently evaluated the opportunity to purchase the U.S.L., but elected to not submit a bid for the league,” Dan Courtemanche, a senior vice president for marketing and communications at M.L.S., said in an e-mail message.

The decision by M.L.S. not to bid for U.S.L. was the result of several factors, including: M.L.S. has a long-term deal with Adidas; acquiring the league could raise potential antitrust issues; any agreement to absorb U.S.L. 1 may rekindle FIFA’s desire for promotion/relegation in M.L.S.; and M.L.S. has already poached U.S.L. teams from attractive markets in Toronto, Vancouver, Portland and Seattle.
642 2009-08-25 With Mr. Paterson, a pattern has developed. He doesn’t call his critics racists in so many words. Rather, he tiptoes around that powerful accusation, and leaves it to others to draw unavoidable (and sinister) conclusions.

He did this last year when he asked in a speech how it was that he — supposedly alone — was referred to as an “accidental governor” because of the unusual circumstances that led to his ascension. He didn’t explicitly say the reason was that he was black. But you’d have to be pretty dense not to have figured out his meaning. If he felt he was being picked on because of his stubbly beard, he might have saved his venting for a gathering of stubbly beard growers. He chose a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

To keep this discussion rooted in reality, many leading figures in American politics have been referred to as accidental this or accidental that. A short list of presidents includes Theodore Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald R. Ford. Governors include Richard J. Codey of New Jersey and M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut. All are white. Yet Mr. Paterson insisted — and according to some reports, continues to insist — that he alone is somehow singled out, and you know why.

HE flipped the race card again the other day, suggesting in a radio interview that he was the victim of an “orchestrated” campaign by some news gatherers to make him look bad. “We’re not in the postracial period” was how he cast his troubles this time.

Of course, Mr. Paterson is entitled to believe whatever he wants. But anyone who has the slightest familiarity with reporters knows that most are incapable of organizing a lunch order, let alone orchestrating an effort to bring down a governor. Judging from comments on various blogs, Mr. Paterson’s latest race-based ruminations have landed with a thud, including among African-Americans.

Mr. Bloomberg, too, distinguished himself on the radio. In defending pharmaceutical companies in the debate over health care, he observed that “their executives don’t make a lot of money.”

To keep this discussion reality-based as well, many chief executives of these companies command eight-figure pay packages. Perhaps that doesn’t impress someone whose worth runs to 11 figures. Fortunately, the pharmaceutical honchos seem to be stiff-upper-lip types; most scrape by on their $10 million a year or more without whining. President Obama is also holding up well. His $400,000-a-year salary was dismissed by Mr. Bloomberg as peanuts. The president, he said in June, “doesn’t get paid that much.”

At least on the matter of the pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Bloomberg (or an aide) recognized the blunder. He’s trying, after all, to convince ordinary New Yorkers that he understands their lives. Minutes later, he said on the air that he had looked up the executives’ pay. “Some of them are making a decent amount of — more than a decent amount of — money,” he said. Indeed they are.

As for Mr. Espada, he who has clung steadfastly to an ever-changing set of loyalties, his son managed miraculously to win a brand-new $120,000-a-year job on the State Senate Democratic staff. This was soon after Mr. Espada had rejoined those same Democrats and become their majority leader. When news of the appointment broke, the son resigned. Throughout, the elder Mr. Espada insisted that nothing untoward had occurred: Nepotism? What nepotism?

As we said, vacationers, you did not miss a lot. In New York politics, some things don’t change.
643 2009-08-25 “I think we’ve all known for two months now that he wasn’t feeling that great,” Francoeur said. “He doesn’t go up there and give up 10 hits, usually he doesn’t go out there and he can’t get it over 90 miles per hour. The Santana we all know, that I’ve faced so many times, is out there pumping 93, 94.”

The Mets’ injuries have reached the point at which fans can reasonably wonder if the franchise has been cursed. Was it the clumsy firing of Willie Randolph last season? Was it building an opulent stadium in the midst of an economic meltdown? Has it been a poor medical staff and training regimen?

Or has it been simply bad luck?

Francoeur, who joined the Mets from Atlanta last month, put his twist on the spate of injuries.

“That’s part of the game,” he said. “Sometimes, you just have a bad run, and this has been one.

“My only guess is that next year is going to be unbelievably good. That’s the way I look at it. The thing that is going to be nice is from a lot of guys who have been hurt, you’ve got to imagine that they’ll come to spring training next year chomping at the bit to get out on the field and get playing. If the whole team comes down with that mentality, it can be a special year next year. You’ve got to believe that something good’s going to come out of this.”

News of Santana’s injury spread quickly to the Phillies’ clubhouse. Pedro Martinez, who spent four seasons with the Mets, said he thought something was wrong last season. Jimmy Rollins, the Phillies’ fiery shortstop, seemed caught off guard. “Johan? Really. That’s surprising,” he said.

Rollins has found particular joy in torturing the Mets. Two seasons ago, he brazenly predicted that his Phillies — not the Mets, who nearly reached the 2006 World Series — were “the team to beat.”

“The Mets had a chance to win the World Series last year,” he said before the 2007 season. “Last year is over. I think we are the team to beat in the N.L. East, finally.” Sure enough, the injury-ravaged Phillies overcame a seven-game deficit and won the National League East.

Last year, Rollins’s Phillies made up three and a half games on the Mets in the season’s final 17 days. Even after the Phillies won the World Series, Rollins couldn’t resist zinging the Mets.

“They brought in that great pitcher, Johan Santana, but they forgot that it takes more than one player to bring home a championship,” he said.

On Monday, Rollins said he didn’t really want to talk about the Mets anymore — “I’m concerned with what goes on in this clubhouse” — but he couldn’t resist.

Rollins was in the Phillies’ lineup Sunday when Bruntlett, the second baseman, turned the game-ending triple play. He said his first thought when he saw the play unfolding was: “That was so stupid.” His second thought was: “Thank you.”

Another gift from the Mets.

But the news of Santana’s injury seemed to soften Rollins’s attitude — a bit. The 2007 and 2008 seasons were demoralizing for the Mets, but this season has been devastating and could take the sting out of an intense rivalry.

“I want them to be good,” Rollins said. “You love to play good teams. Probably because of where we’ve both been the last couple years, the rivalry is still there, smoldering just underneath. Even if we’re both bad, we want to at least be able to say we’re better than them. But you want them to be good.”

And so with a month left to play, the Mets’ nightmare continues.

One caution to Mets fans: don’t ask what else can go wrong.
644 2009-08-25 Mrs. Matthews said the police told the family that her husband was no longer a suspect, but the police have not declared that publicly. Indeed, they refuse to say whether he was ever a suspect.

So Mr. Matthews — who works nights as a driver for the city’s Administration for Children’s Services, which the family says would surely have fired him if he were suspected of murder — spends his free time as a private investigator of sorts. He drives around the neighborhood to interview people he thinks may know something about his daughter’s death.

Meanwhile, the police are conducting “scores of interviews” of their own, said the chief police spokesman, Paul J. Browne.

“This is a heavy-duty case,” Mr. Browne said. “By no means is it cold.”

He said that though DNA tests were done on Sabrina’s parents and sisters, that did not necessarily mean any of them were suspects. Investigators often test the DNA of family members to determine if there is any other DNA at a crime scene that may be from an intruder.

Still, the relationship between the family and the police is strained. Mrs. Matthews believes that the early focus on her husband distracted the police from other leads. And because the officers tell her little, she suspects they are idle. “If this was a white neighborhood, something would be done,” she said.

The police say sharing information would jeopardize the investigation. Mrs. Matthews said they chided the family over its freelance detective work, saying it could muddy the waters.

As the parallel investigations unfold, grief is a constant. Mrs. Matthews sits after work on the wide front porch of their yellow stucco house, then locks it up at night and sleeps at a friend’s house. Her own is haunted with bad memories and fear that the killer could return.

Mrs. Matthews, 50, said she used to walk freely at night. Now, she said, “Every guy I see, I think this is the killer, and I hate them, God forgive me.”

The murder mystery has unfolded against a backdrop common in the neighborhood: Two immigrant parents working different shifts, sleeping at different times, trying to keep tabs on the sometimes-mysterious life of a teenager.

On Saturday, Nov. 8, Mrs. Matthews said, she went to sleep around 10:45 p.m. She heard her husband leave for work around 11, she said. Sabrina went to her mother’s room later to get Vaseline for her lips.

“That was the last time I saw her, my sweet baby,” Mrs. Matthews said with a sob.

She said she awoke around 5:30 and saw what she thought was a muddy footprint on the basement floor, not realizing it was her daughter’s darkened blood. (The police have not said why there was blood in the basement.) She wrote a note asking Sabrina to clean the floor, she said, and left in time to get to work at 7 a.m.

Her husband came home around 10 a.m., she said. Shortly before 1:30 p.m., he went to wake Sabrina and found her dead, naked from the waist down, Mrs. Matthews said. There was no sign of a break-in, and the police have not said whether she was raped.

Mrs. Matthews said that her husband had never been violent toward her or her daughters and that LaToya had previously called the police when she was fighting with him over her studies. Asked if violence was involved, LaToya said, “No comment; it’s irrelevant.”

Mrs. Matthews and her daughters said Sabrina was an obedient, studious girl whom they never saw with boys. (Mr. Matthews did not want to be interviewed for this article, they said, because he felt wronged by the news media.)

But they had worried recently about her friends, especially after a teacher said that Sabrina had potential but warned that she should stay away from one girl, a childhood friend who was sexually active. Mrs. Matthews was worried enough that she tried in vain to have Sabrina transferred from Martin Van Buren High School.

Mrs. Matthews said the girl later told Mr. Matthews that she and Sabrina had been meeting boys at night; she now wonders if Sabrina let in a boyfriend, who killed her. “She was too trusting,” she said.

A reward for information reported to 1-800-577-TIPS has been raised to $22,000.
645 2009-08-25 It is what many people say they fear most from an overhaul of the health care system — the prospect of the federal government’s limiting the medical care they can receive.

Even some people who now have private health insurance through their employers have expressed this concern in opinion polls and public forums. They say they worry that the enormous price tag for providing care to tens of millions of additional Americans will eventually force everyone else to make do with less.

Policy experts say people are rightly concerned about the nation’s health care costs. But they also say there is nothing in the current proposals in Washington to suggest that the country is likely to embark on a system of medical rationing anytime soon.

Those fears, the experts say, seem to stem from talk of a government-run health plan or proposals for government-sponsored research to determine which medical treatments are most effective. But few health policy experts see the likelihood of lawmakers’ adopting some sort of new system in which government bureaucrats decide whether someone’s grandfather can get his hip replaced or a wife can have her cancer treatment paid for.

“I don’t think all of this fast-forwards to something called a national rationing program,” said Paul H. Keckley, the executive director for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions in Washington, a unit of the Deloitte consulting firm. “Our culture is not going to allow that.”
646 2009-08-25 Mr. Giuliani declined to be interviewed, but several people who have spoken to him said he sees parallels between the current conditions in Albany and those in the city before his election as mayor. Voters were willing to take a chance on him then, he has said, in part because they were fed up with the dysfunction.

“Several times, he said to me that he sees state government similar to where was in 1993: out of control,” said Mr. King, who met with Mr. Giuliani late last month at the Capitol Hill Club. “So many people are saying the state can’t be governed, which is what everyone was saying about the city then. In Rudy’s mind, this is a challenge.”

Mr. Giuliani suggested as much at a breakfast address sponsored by Crain’s New York in this month.

“If I thought that I could make a real difference in the state, really change things and it really needed me, then I probably would do it,” he said then. If the state continues to deteriorate, he added, “maybe I’ll decide to run. We’ll see.”

Mr. Giuliani is unpredictable at times, and even his closest advisers cannot say for sure what he will do. One adviser said an announcement was likely to come after the Nov. 3 city election.

Running would probably mean the former mayor, 65, would have to give up his lucrative speaking engagements — each brings him tens of thousands of dollars, associates say — and once again step back from his two businesses, the large -based law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, and the consulting firm Giuliani Partners, which he started with several of his former aides from the mayor’s office.

The consulting firm has suffered more noticeably from his electoral distractions; recent defections have included Mr. Giuliani’s former chief of staff, Anthony V. Carbonetti, who largely severed ties with the firm this year but was among the aides making calls in the wake of Mr. Mondello’s departure Monday.

And there are other calculations. His aides and other Republicans believe he could handily beat Gov. ; they cite any number of polls that have included hypothetical match-ups, as well as Mr. Paterson’s dismal approval numbers. Taking on Attorney General , who many Democrats hope will be the party’s candidate for governor in 2010, would be a more difficult test, the aides say.

In fact, rumblings about a Giuliani candidacy are already improving Mr. Cuomo’s stature among Democratic strategists, who believe he would be a far better candidate than Mr. Paterson to face Mr. Giuliani in the general election. Mr. Giuliani’s aides insist that his decision will not be influenced by Mr. Cuomo, who is not expected to decide about running for governor until next year.

“Rudy never did worry who his opponent is,” said , the former borough president. “If he decides to run, it won’t matter if Cuomo is the Democratic candidate.”

Mr. Molinari said that Mr. Giuliani visited him at his law office two weeks ago and that they discussed a potential governor’s run at some length.

“Watching him closely, when he hears me talking about how the people need him, that seems to be when his ears perk up,” he added. “I get the sense that if he felt that he’d be the one that could take on that task and turn things around up in Albany, he might consider running.”

In Buffalo last week, Mr. Giuliani met with a number of Republican officials after delivering a motivational speech at a local hockey arena.

“I got the impression that he is really seriously considering this,” said Assemblyman Bill Reilich, chairman of the Republican Party in Monroe County, adding, “If he had made up his mind, I don’t think the intensity of his questions would have been what they were and he would have continued the conversation as long as he did.”

Many Republicans are desperate for Mr. Giuliani to run. The only declared Republican candidate, former Representative , has a thin political résumé and is best known for his failed run for the against .

The first step for Mr. Giuliani is getting the party’s house in order. Mr. Mondello’s hold on the chairmanship has been tenuous since November, when the party lost the state Senate. He has recently been facing an aggressive challenge from Edward F. Cox, a lawyer and son-in-law of President who was chairman of Senator ’s presidential campaign in New York.

Mr. Giuliani would prefer to have Mr. Wojtaszek, an early supporter of his presidential campaign, as the state chairman.

“It’s not an anti-Ed Cox thing,” said a person close to the Giuliani camp. “It’s very much that Henry’s our friend.”

Mr. King suggested Mr. Giuliani would not bother to plunge into the state party fracas unless he was serious about running.

“That’s the worst part of politics,” Mr. King said. “No rational person wants to get involved in one of those fights unless you really have a motive to do it.”
647 2009-08-25 The story of Caster Semenya, an 18-year-old from South African who won the women’s 800 meters at the world track and field championships last week, generated an international debate about sex verification and classification in sports. An essay by Alice Dreger, a professor of clinical medical humanities and bioethics, that was published in Saturday’s editions of The New York Times brought an outpouring of e-mail and online comments from readers.

Most of us are born into either of two groups, male or female, with clearly identifiable sexual organs and gender-specific traits, but for a small third group it is more ambiguous. Society does not generally cater to the androgynous. I’m sure it must be difficult for Semenya to go through these tests and have people question her athletic validity. Good luck to her and her tests. I hope the tests allow her continue female competition.

However, retaining a level playing field is the basic premise in all competitive sports. If we all agree that men should not compete against women because their genetics alter the playing field, then we should apply the same standard to people in the gender-ambiguous category — albeit if they are in fact more genetically and physiologically similar to the sex outside their competitive category. If she is more male than female, shouldn’t she be competing against men instead of women? Just because she considers herself a woman doesn’t mean she qualifies for female-specific athletic competition. That is why we need a panel of experts to decide. It is invasive but necessary to maintain athletic integrity.

I just wanted to say that your piece was one of the most interesting and edifying articles I’ve come across in a long time. Very thought-provoking, nicely complexifying, well written, and with a welcome tone of humanism/compassion running through it.

The question here seems to be whether Semenya should be allowed to run as a woman if the testosterone is natural and not injected; or if she is a hermaphrodite. The binary classifications of sports might have a difficult time accommodating the continuum of human sexuality.
648 2009-08-25 The bowhead whale has a tough task when it comes to diving and feeding. Opening its huge mouth to expose its baleen plates, so it can filter plankton and other organisms from seawater, creates a lot of extra drag. But the bowhead has only a limited supply of oxygen for each dive.

What’s the whale to do? It could filter-feed only occasionally, or it could feed continuously but slow down. Either way reduces drag, and thus the energy expended.

Malene Simon of Aarhus University in Denmark and colleagues studied bowheads feeding off West Greenland by attaching small acoustic tags (developed by two of the study’s authors, Mark Johnson and Peter Tyack) that also contain pressure sensors to record depth and accelerometers and magnetometers to record the whale’s orientation.

As the researchers report in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, at the bottom of their dives the whales moved at very slow speeds, less than three feet per second, continuously using their tails, or flukes, to propel them. That suggests they kept their mouths open for filter-feeding throughout the bottom part of the dives.

Despite the slow speed, the researchers calculate that the whales can filter about 100 cubic feet of water per second, or more than 2,000 tons of water and prey during a typical dive.
649 2009-08-25 I saw a wonderful raccoon at the Delacorte Theater the other night. It appeared, as serene and silent as a rising moon, at the far edge of the open-air stage in Central Park where the Public Theater presents its summer productions. Its face a shining-eyed mask, this creature froze for just a second to scrutinize the audience from the spotlight before being followed in unhurried procession into the darkness by two other raccoons.

These reminders of the mysterious and often forgotten coexistence of the natural and urban worlds in New York City offered an appetite-whetting prologue to a play about the animal in humanity. I suppose I shouldn’t admit that I kept thinking about those raccoons all through the 90 minutes of JoAnne Akalaitis’s interpretation of “The Bacchae,” which opened last night in a production starring Jonathan Groff and Anthony Mackie, with music by Philip Glass. But, you see, those animals had everything that this show lacks: mystery, grace, charisma and (though they didn’t bare them) teeth.

It’s not easy to create a toothless “Bacchae,” Euripides’ abidingly provocative study of the feral impulses that writhe beneath the surface of civilization. Written in the fifth century B.C., “The Bacchae” is the most disturbing and perplexing work from the author of “Electra,” “Medea” and “The Trojan Women,” and possibly the most upsetting play in Greek tragedy. Scholars have argued about it for centuries, variously reading it as a clash of Asian and Hellenic cultures, a battle of ego and id, and a study in the tenacious hold of the primitive in the face of an imposed modernity.

What is inescapably evident, even from a quick reading of this tale of a puritanical young king who pits his authority against that of an immortal and amoral god, is the warm, thick darkness that courses through it like blood in a frightened animal. I’ve seen “The Bacchae” performed as a cold formal dance, with ceremonial masks and stilted diction, and it still gave me nightmares.

I left Ms. Akalaitis’s version, which runs through Sunday, with no premonition of bad dreams. An enduring figure in experimental theater and a founder of the deeply influential Mabou Mines troupe, Ms. Akalaitis would seem to be a natural for “The Bacchae.” She has never been afraid of discomfiting or alienating audiences, and she has never shied from the obscure. On the contrary, she is famous for adding layers of ambiguity to texts that seemed perfectly clear.

Her “Bacchae,” though, has fewer shadows than a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. This is not a capricious comparison. The tone of this production, which uses a new (and appealingly accessible) translation by Nicholas Rudall and a score by Mr. Glass that brings to mind stripped-down Tchaikovsky ballet music, is bizarrely that of light opera in a minor key. Even when a character gleefully hefts a severed head (which happens to be her son’s) in the air, the show exudes the frolicsome blandness of a Ruritanian romance set to music.
650 2009-08-25 But given the rash of injuries that have tormented the Mets this year, there is little reason for optimism.

Santana has been one of the most dominating pitchers in baseball since 2003, but he has not been himself lately. Santana is 1-1 with an uncharacteristically high 3.94 earned run average over his last four starts; his E.R.A for the season is 3.12.

More alarming, the velocity on Santana’s fastball has been lower this year. In the past he has often thrown in the mid-90-mile-per-hour range, but lately he has been in the high 80s.

Manager Jerry Manuel, who revealed the news about Santana’s injury almost as an aside at the end of his news conference after the game, said that Santana had not been throwing in the bullpen between starts, as he normally does, since at least before the All-Star break in mid-July. Presumably, that was to allow the elbow to heal and preserve whatever pitches he had for games.

Manuel said he was “terribly concerned” about the situation, and “I know now that it concerns him.”

Santana, who was not available to reporters after the game, has demonstrated a willingness to pitch on short rest or through injuries, especially during a pennant race. He showed that last year when he ignored an aching knee and threw a shutout in his final start. He later had surgery on his left knee.

The Mets were 13 games out of the wild-card race heading into Monday night, but Manuel conceded that the discomfort in Santana’s elbow was serious enough that he would not have made this scheduled start even if the Mets were in contention.

“I think it’s smart,” said reliever Billy Wagner, who had ligament-replacement surgery last Sept. 10. “He’s got a career to worry about. I know that he’s a gamer and he’s a competitor and he wants to be out there with his teammates and fight through all the adversity that this team has had to go through. But if he tries to push it and possibly injures himself worse, I mean, he’s talking about his career. He’s not talking about just one season, 14 or 15 games out.”

The news about Santana followed another dispiriting loss in which Lee easily handled the Mets over seven innings to win his eighth consecutive start. With the latest victory, Lee, who was acquired from the Cleveland Indians on July 29, became the first pitcher since Santana in 2004 to win eight straight starts in which he threw at least seven innings and allowed no more than two runs. And both runs Lee allowed Monday were unearned.

Since joining the Phillies, Lee is 5-0 with an E.R.A. of 0.68 He was helped by Ryan Howard, who hit two home runs and drove in five runs. Howard hit a three-run homer in the first inning and a two-run shot in the third, his 34th of the season.

For the second consecutive day, Angel Pagan led off the game for the Mets by rounding the bases on a ball that did not go over the fence. On Sunday he hit an inside-the-park home run. On Monday he circled the bases on a pop fly to shallow right field that second baseman Chase Utley dropped. Utley then threw the ball into foul territory behind third base trying to gun down the fleet Pagan at second base. Pagan, who had slid into second, got up and scored easily. ... Right fielder Jeff Francoeur’s left thumb, which he injured Sunday while diving for a ball, swelled considerably overnight, so he had an M.R.I. that revealed a torn ligament. Francoeur is listed as day-to-day but said he hoped to be able to play when the swelling goes down in a couple of days.
651 2009-08-25 The Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, less than three weeks after it closed its mortgage lending business and was suspended by a federal agency.

The company, which was the nation’s 12th-largest mortgage lender from January to June, filed for protection in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Fla.

Taylor Bean has more than $1 billion of both assets and liabilities, and 1,000 to 5,000 creditors, according to the bankruptcy petition.

This month, the Federal Housing Administration suspended Taylor Bean, citing its failure to submit a required annual financial report, its having “misrepresented” that it had no unresolved issues with its auditor and “irregular transactions that raised concerns of fraud.”

The suspension came after Taylor Bean’s failed effort to invest $300 million in Colonial BancGroup to help keep the troubled lender, based in Montgomery, Ala., afloat.

Regulators seized Colonial’s banking operations on Aug. 14 and sold its assets to the BB&T Corporation, the regional bank in Winston-Salem, N.C.

Taylor Bean, based in Ocala, Fla., made $17 billion of mortgage loans from January to June, for a 1.7 percent market share nationwide, according to the newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.
652 2009-08-25 On the issue of Mr. Middelhoff’s expenses, the bankruptcy trustee has up to three years to sue former executives on behalf of creditors. Bankruptcy lawyers say that the number of civil lawsuits brought by trustees has multiplied because insolvent companies, particularly those in the services sector, like Arcandor, tend to have fewer assets that can be sold to pay creditors. Also, trustees are liable under German law if they ignore evidence that could form the basis of a civil case.

The real estate dealings were first disclosed by Mr. Middelhoff five years ago when he joined Arcandor. But prosecutors took notice in June after the German justice minister, Brigitte Zypries, requested an investigation that was eventually referred to a Bochum prosecutors’ unit that specializes in economic crime.

Mr. Middelhoff, now 56, rose to prominence from 1998 to 2002 as chief executive of Bertelsmann, which owns Random House and many other media businesses.

With the undisclosed bonus he secured for selling Bertelsmann’s share in AOL Europe for $6.75 billion and other compensation, he left Bertelsmann a wealthy man.

One relationship Mr. Middelhoff established over the years was with Josef Esch, who runs a group of investment funds from the Cologne suburb Troisdorf.

The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel has invested significant resources in looking into the link between Mr. Esch and Mr. Middelhoff, and provided what it said was evidence of a deep relationship on a business and personal level. It has documented that Mr. Esch bought a car for Mr. Middelhoff’s daughter.

Together with his wife, Cornelie, Mr. Middelhoff invested money in 2000 and 2001 with Mr. Esch in funds that were formed to buy five properties from KarstadtQuelle, as Arcandor was then known, and leased back to the department store chain before Mr. Middelhoff joined the company, according to Mr. Middelhoff’s spokesman. He became chairman of Arcandor in 2004 and switched to chief executive in 2005. (He left in March, shortly before Arcandor declared bankruptcy.)

The company’s business had been in decline for years, and Mr. Middelhoff’s appointment was viewed as a last bid to rescue it. But it created a conflict of interest, which Mr. Middelhoff disclosed before joining the board. Arcandor would naturally want the lowest possible rents for Karstadt, but an investor in Mr. Esch’s funds would want to wring more out of tenants.

Mr. Middelhoff promised to work only in Arcandor’s interest, and prosecutors are expected to examine to what extent he kept this promise.

Ulf D. Posé, who heads the Association for German Business Ethics, an industry group, criticized Mr. Middelhoff’s notion that transparency was enough in such a case. “It’s like being married and then telling your wife you have something on the side,” he said.

Shareholder advocates were not satisfied with Mr. Middelhoff’s stance and questioned him repeatedly at annual meetings — the last in May 2008 — as to whether he had renegotiated Karstadt rents with Mr. Esch’s funds. “We only got vague answers,” said Marc Tüngler, a managing director at DSW, a German shareholder protection group.

Since then, Der Spiegel has reported that Mr. Middelhoff and his wife together held an interest of more than 20 percent of one of the funds that invested in Arcandor property. Sven Thomas, Mr. Middelhoff’s lawyer, said that the investment in the Esch funds was “on average, roughly or below 10 percent.” Through a spokesman, Hannes Bahrmann, Mr. Middelhoff also said that the rents “had been negotiated for the long term” before he arrived as chief executive and “could not be negotiated anew.”

The bankruptcy trustee, Klaus Hubert Görg, said last week that he was turning his attention toward Mr. Middelhoff’s expenditures as Arcandor chief executive.

In particular, Mr. Görg has said he was surprised by Mr. Middelhoff’s use of Challenge Air, a luxury charter airline. It is co-owned by Mr. Esch. Der Spiegel reported that Mr. Middelhoff had spent 811,000 euros, or $1.2 million at current exchange rates, on Challenge Air flights in 2006, when Arcandor was fighting to stay afloat.

“The administrative costs for the top executives were very high,” Mr. Görg said, “in any case, very high for a company in the financial shape of Arcandor.”

Mr. Thomas said that any use of the planes had been approved by the board, and he denied that the trustee would have the basis for a claim.
653 2009-08-25 Physicians are allowed to use drugs in ways that are not specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a practice called off-label prescribing. There is usually less scientific evidence to support nonapproved uses, and a new survey of physicians has found that many might not even know when they are prescribing off label.

The average physician in the survey identified the F.D.A. approval status correctly for only about half the drugs on a list provided by the researchers, according to a study in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety.

Confusion was greatest with psychiatric drugs, the survey of some 600 doctors found. Nearly one in five who prescribed Seroquel (quetiapine) in the previous year thought it was approved for patients with dementia and agitation, even though it was never approved for this use and even carried a “black box” warning that it was dangerous for elderly patients with dementia. And one in three doctors who used lorazepam (often marketed as Ativan) to treat chronic anxiety thought it had been approved for this use; in fact, the F.D.A. warning advises against using it for this purpose.

The study’s senior author, Dr. G. Caleb Alexander, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, said a concern was that off-label uses often did not have the same level of scientific scrutiny as F.D.A.-approved uses.
654 2009-08-25 The weekend gave us plenty of math to ponder. Baseball provided a triple play, which required about three square feet of space, yet appeared to contain the sum of two entire seasons (Phillies=good; Mets=dreadful). Some of track’s world records required major subtraction skills. And then there is the new N.F.L. math: how to spend $1.2 billion on a stadium, $40 million on a video scoreboard the size of Kazakhstan and zero dollars on someone with a brain large enough to figure out that N.F.L. punts are going to ricochet off it like popcorn.

Because Jerry Jones, the owner of the Cowboys, doesn’t seem to understand why his new toy should be altered for the silly football games being played inside it — even after Titans punters plunked it repeatedly — the N.F.L. is now considering stepping in, and Peter King details the league’s options on SI.com.

Of course, the Cowboys do get points for not signing a player whose math skills are taxed trying to figure out how broke he is. This is now on the Eagles’ slide rule instead: after recently finishing his sentence, Michael Vick will reportedly spend the morning before his first exhibition game in bankruptcy court. Perhaps because the Eagles used to have a temporary courtroom in their stadium, this feels like karma, of sorts.

In Denver, they have much more important things to think about, including the wardrobe of the new Broncos coach Josh McDaniels, who was doing his most unfortunate Bill Belichick impression in the latest exhibition game, with Belichick weighing in as well. In Baltimore, a Ravens player was arrested after an incident sparked by a suspicious-looking cellphone.

Fortunately, baseball is still offering on-the-field news not influenced by giant scoreboards, led by Philadelphia’s Eric Bruntlett completing the 15th unassisted triple play in major league history. That it happened against the ridiculously sliding Mets seemed to encapsulate perfectly both teams’ seasons, writes Lisa Olson on Fanhouse.com. And it also gave Phillies pitcher Pedro Martinez a chance to get a bit of revenge, writes Filip Bondy of The Daily News.
655 2009-08-25 After struggling to gain a toehold in the pharmaceutical business, Procter & Gamble has finally decided to give up. The company announced on Monday that it would sell its global pharmaceutical business to the Irish drug maker Warner Chilcott for $3.1 billion, ending two decades of setbacks and missteps.

The sale came as no surprise. P.& G said last December it was looking to shed its prescription drug business and halt all pharmaceutical research and development. The move was meant to steer the company back toward its more familiar business of selling over-the-counter health care products directly to consumers.

For P.& G., the deal is the first significant decision by Robert A. McDonald, who took over as chief executive last month. For Warner Chilcott, the acquisition is expected to triple the company’s revenue and drastically expand its product line. The P.& G drug portfolio, which generated $2.3 billion in annual sales, included Actonel, a leading treatment for weakened bones in older people, and 40 other drugs including well-known medications for colitis and overactive bladders.

“The acquisition of the P.& G. pharmaceutical brand and employee talent is a transformational, strategic move for us,” said Roger Boissonneault, president and chief executive of Warner Chilcott, whose shares rose $4.35, or 27 percent, on Monday, to $20.41. The company, which had revenue of $938 million in 2008, specializes in oral contraceptives and dermatology products. Its United States headquarters are in Rockaway, N.J.

“This move enables us to focus singularly on winning in consumer health care — personal health care, oral care and feminine care,” Mr. McDonald said in a statement. P& G.’s leading consumer health products include Vicks cold remedies, Crest toothpaste, Prilosec, which treats heartburn, and Always feminine hygiene products.
656 2009-08-25 PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — The Reader’s Digest Association filed for prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday as it faced falling print circulation in the Internet age and looming debt payments.

Known for its heartwarming stories about American life as other publications printed edgier fare, the company’s flagship, Reader’s Digest magazine, has lost circulation in the United States. That circulation fell to just over eight million last year, from a peak of more than 17 million in the 1970s.

Reader’s Digest said the prearranged bankruptcy filing, which affects only United States operations, would give lenders a 92.5 percent ownership stake in exchange for lowering its indebtedness to $550 million, from $2.2 billion. The company has obtained the approval of more than 80 percent of its senior secured lenders, critical for a quicker departure from bankruptcy protection.

“We look forward to emerging with a restructured balance sheet and as a financially stronger organization that is positioned to pursue growth and transformational initiatives,” the chief executive, Mary G. Berner, said in a statement.

Ms. Berner cited problems with two underperforming properties the company agreed to sell last year: Books Are Fun Ltd., which sells books at book fairs and other events, and QSP, which helps schools and youth groups raise money.

676 2009-08-26 Colonial BancGroup filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, 11 days after regulators seized its banking operations and sold most of those assets to BB&T.

The company filed for protection from creditors with the federal bankruptcy court in Montgomery, Ala., where it is based. The filing was expected, and covers the holding company, which was not part of the asset sale to BB&T, a southeast regional bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C.

The company collapsed after an aggressive foray into Florida left it exposed to many losses from construction loans and foreclosures.

A planned $300 million outside investment from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corporation that could have shored up its capital base fell through last month. Taylor Bean itself filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which arranged the sale of most of Colonial’s banking assets to BB&T, agreed to split the losses with BB&T on a $15 billion pool that is largely made up of commercial real estate and construction loans. BB&T will be responsible for losses on the remaining $7 billion worth of assets, which it will own outright.
677 2009-08-26 Two state legislators pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy in Federal District Court in St. Louis and resigned from their offices in the aftermath of a case involving the cover-up of election fraud. Senator Jeff Smith, Democrat of St. Louis, entered two guilty pleas to conspiracy to obstruct justice, and Representative Steve Brown, Democrat of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Mr. Smith admitted to illegally coordinating with an independent political committee during his 2004 campaign for Congress, and to dispatching his friend, Mr. Brown, to raise money for the group. Both admitted to hampering an investigation of the incident by the Federal Elections Commission. Each count of conspiracy carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10.
678 2009-08-26 UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) — The head of the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Sudan’s Darfur region, who some diplomats say has been ineffective, is stepping down, United Nations officials said Tuesday.

Officials from the United Nations are working closely with the African Union to find a replacement for the head of the peacekeeping mission, Rodolphe Adada, who is a former foreign minister of Congo, said Marie Okabe, a United Nations spokeswoman.

The peacekeeping force in Darfur, known as Unamid, said in a statement that Mr. Adada’s resignation would take effect on Monday. Diplomats said he was expected to return to politics in Congo.

Gen. Henry Anyidoho of Ghana, deputy chief of the peacekeeping force, will be in charge until a permanent replacement for Mr. Adada is named, United Nations officials said.

The conflict in Darfur in western Sudan has been going on for more than six years. The United Nations says that as many as 300,000 people have died, while Sudan’s government has placed the official toll at 10,000. About 4.7 million people in Darfur rely on international aid to survive, according to the United Nations.
679 2009-08-26 The United States will stop issuing most visas at its embassy in Tegucigalpa, the capital, a measure intended to increase pressure on the de facto government of Honduras to accept an agreement to restore the country’s ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, to office. Seven Latin American officials ended a mission to Honduras on Tuesday that failed to win any concessions. Washington suspended about $18 million in military aid after the June 28 coup, but activists have urged the United States to take stronger measures.
680 2009-08-26 Prices for beef, milk, eggs and some other grocery items have been dropping for several months, providing relief for consumers who suffered through the steep increases of a year ago. But prices are likely to start edging upward again as the economy recovers, according to a new federal report and economic analysts.

“The impact from lower energy prices on grocery store prices has largely been played out, and so we’re now looking at grocery store prices to rise modestly through the end of the year,” said Mark Vitner, a managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo.

The government report, by the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture, said that grocery prices decreased 0.5 percent in July, compared with June. Compared with July 2008, when overall food costs were surging, grocery prices in July were down 0.9 percent.

In several food categories, prices dropped sharply. Beef fell 2.3 percent in July, compared with June, the eighth decrease in the last nine months, according to the report. Egg prices were down 2.7 percent from June to July and were 21.3 percent below their level in July a year ago. Milk prices declined 0.4 percent in the month, the 10th decline in the last 11 months, and were 18.4 percent below July 2008.

The national average price for a gallon of fresh whole milk in July was $2.99, compared with $3.96 in the same month a year earlier, a 25 percent drop, according to federal data.
681 2009-08-26 The British government said on Tuesday that it might require Internet service providers to fight illegal copying of music and movies by suspending the accounts of online pirates.

The new approach, similar to proposals in France, follows complaints from the music and movie industries that the British authorities are not doing enough to curb illegal file-sharing. In June, the government proposed softer antipiracy measures, including slowing down broadband service of consumers found to be pirating material, but stopped short of calls to block access.

“Some stakeholders have argued strongly that none of those technical measures is powerful enough to have a significant deterrent effect on infringing behavior,” the revised proposal says.

The proposal was made in a revision to the June recommendations, published as part of the government’s strategy for the digital economy, and will be open to public comment until the end of September before any legislation is introduced.

But suspending service is a highly controversial subject. Business and personal communications are increasingly shifting to the Internet, and governments have outlined plans to make broadband a universal service, like electricity or running water.

Fiercely opposed by advocates of an unfettered Internet, the French plan has faced legislative and judicial hurdles. It has yet to be adopted nearly two years after it was proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy.
682 2009-08-26 A food market a stone’s throw from the Brooklyn Navy Yard and in the shadow of the B.Q.E. may hardly seem a shopper’s paradise. But Andrew Goldin, near right, and his brother, David, have lined the shelves, bins and display cases of Fresh Fanatic, the 7,000-square-foot boutique supermarket they own with Joshua Niamehr, with live lobsters, artisanal cheeses, whole fish to be filleted to order and meats that are marinated and ready to cook. There are exotics like ostrich, and also sushi, cold and hot prepared foods and breads and pastas made in-house.

FAMILY ENDEAVOR Andrew Goldin, 22, studied hospitality management; David, 30, is the developer. Their family owns the building, which has loft apartments above. A Web site and delivery are coming, as are cooking classes by their chef, Manny Marin.

Some items are good buys, like prosciutto di Parma for $15.95 a pound and a dozen large organic eggs for $2.50. Other prices, including Parmigiano-Reggiano for $12.95 a pound, a 6-ounce container of raspberries for $3.32 and sockeye salmon for $14.50 a pound, are quite reasonable. Fresh Fanatic is at 275 Park Avenue (Washington Avenue), Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (888) 373-7404.
683 2009-08-26 For at least the last 40 years, likely longer, borderland vendors, in Tucson and elsewhere, have been refashioning the hot dog with a cloak of bacon, a clump of beans and a chop of tomatoes and onions, followed by squirts of mayonnaise, mustard and salsa verde. (Ketchup and other condiments show up, too. More recently, some vendors have begun offering a topping of crumbled potato chips.)

In a dozen or more cities across the United States, these Mexican takes on the American hot dog are ascendant — from Chicago to Denver to Los Angeles, where illegal street vendors selling so-called danger dogs to late-night crowds play hide-and-seek with the local health department.

Only in Tucson, however, do locals like Ms. Murillo cede hot dog provenance to Mexico. In Tucson, bacon-wrapped, Mexican-dressed hot dogs are not ascendant. They’re dominant.

A Mexican-American take on the hot dog aesthetic was relatively late to arrive. In 1940s Arizona, tamales were known, at least among speakers of colloquial English, as Mexican hot dogs. By the 1950s, true tamales were gaining mainstream status stateside, and American hot dogs had, more than likely, jumped the gate into Sonora and Baja and elsewhere.

The date at which bacon-wrapped hot dogs became known as Mexican hot dogs is unclear. The mystery deepens when you factor in that Sonora, one of the states most often cited as ground zero for bacon-wrapped hot dogs, is a locus for cattle ranching, not pig farming.

From the southern side of the border, numerous Mexico City origin tales emanate, some tied to feeding crowds at wrestling matches in the 1950s, others to feeding skyscraper construction workers during the same decade. (Daniel Contreras, owner of El Güero Canelo, cites a similar time frame, and tells just as plausible a story, but sets the action in his home state of Sonora, where a man he knew as Don Pancho worked the streets.)

As is the case with most folk dishes, its true crucible may never be pinpointed, but folkloric suppositions aside, the answer may be a simple matter of salesmanship:

By 1953, Oscar Mayer was running print ads, selling American consumers on the virtues of bacon-wrapped hot dogs. Perhaps Mexican consumers, inspired to emulate American dietary habits, took Oscar Mayer at its word, wrapping American-made hot dogs in American-made bacon, and claiming the resulting construction as their own.

One recent afternoon, at one of the two Oop’s hot dog stands he operates on Tucson’s south side, Martin Lizarraga sat beneath a tent-draped ramada anchored on one end by a flattop-equipped hot dog cart, and on the other end by a minivan painted with a hip hop-inspired, anthropomorphic hot dog character.

As a tripod-mounted speaker blared norteño music into the street, and toritos — mozzarella-stuffed, bacon-wrapped güerito chiles — browned and then blistered on the flattop, Mr. Lizarraga talked of the days when he worked as a liquor salesman in the Sonoran capital city of Hermosillo, frequenting the “table dancing club” for which he named his two hot dog stands.

With his 14-year-old daughter, Abigail Lizarraga, by his side, he spoke, with great enthusiasm, of Hermosillo, where “every corner has a hot dog stand” and “the health department is not so strict,” and vendors have the freedom to garnish a dog with everything from cucumbers in sour cream to crumbled chorizo.

Pressed to define the Sonoran hot dog, as served in Tucson, Mr. Lizarraga talked of the importance of the roll into which the dog is stuffed. (He buys his from Alejandro’s, where they bake a roll that is both soft and pleasantly pliant.) And he talked of the squeeze bottles of guacamole purée, with which he stocks both carts.

But Mr. Lizarraga did not mention the wrap of bacon, for that, in the world of the hotdoguero, is understood.
684 2009-08-26 A lawsuit filed against the design company of the architect Frank Gehry, below, involving a dispute over the right to use his illustrations on jewelry was dismissed on Monday in Los Angeles. Circa Publishing Enterprises, based in Culver City, Calif., filed suit against Gehry Design in 2007 after Mr. Gehry struck a deal with Tiffany & Company allowing Tiffany to create jewelry based on his fish shapes and other designs. In its suit, Circa Publishing said it already had an exclusive deal with Mr. Gehry to create and sell jewelry and gift items featuring his trademarks. But lawyers for Mr. Gehry said the agreement with Circa Publishing had been terminated when Mr. Gehry entered into his deal with Tiffany. Judge Jane Johnson of Los Angeles County Superior Court granted a motion to dismiss the case on Monday after both sides gave testimony but before closing arguments had been made.
685 2009-08-26 Mrs. Merkel’s decision to throw her political weight behind the bid from Magna International and Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned savings bank, comes with national elections just a month away. Saving jobs and Germany’s manufacturing base are major issues as she campaigns for a second term.

But with its new lease on life, G.M. is feeling emboldened enough to try to renegotiate the terms of the sale of its struggling European unit. Last week, G.M.’s board declined to pick a winning bid, stunning both Berlin and Opel’s labor unions, which had supported the Magna offer as a way to save the most jobs.

G.M. fears that if Opel is controlled by Russians, it could lose control over its patents and intellectual property rights, even though G.M. would retain a minority stake, people close to the company said, also on condition of anonymity, because the talks were continuing.

At the same time, G.M. does not want to offend officials in Russia, where it has stakes in three assembly plants building Cadillac, Hummer and Chevrolet models. Chevrolet is Russia’s No. 2 selling brand, behind the homegrown Lada.

A senior American official based in Washington who has been privy to the negotiations said G.M. feared that a Magna-controlled Opel would receive preferential treatment, like easier customs clearances, over other G.M. brands.

“Frankly, there are a lot of unanswered questions out there because doing business with the Russians has been very, very difficult,” the official said.

Meanwhile, 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in bridge financing provided by Germany in the spring is expected to run out in November, making Opel workers increasingly nervous.

At home, Mrs. Merkel is facing criticism for coming out so strongly for the Magna-Sberbank deal and discounting other options, including an offer from Fiat of Italy, because they offered less security for Germany.

Bild, the large German daily newspaper that has been supportive of Mrs. Merkel, said Tuesday that she was jeopardizing American-German relations.

Two other newspapers, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt, have questioned Mrs. Merkel for committing 4.5 billion euros of taxpayer support to the Magna bid, and for adopting an uncompromising attitude toward the negotiations.

For Mrs. Merkel, the Opel decision has become about more than saving jobs or winning elections. It also reflects strains between Germany and the United States over issues like Afghanistan and economic stimulus plans.

In public, Mrs. Merkel has called on the White House to pressure G.M. But officials in Washington said Tuesday that President Obama did not want to be dragged into the negotiations despite the government’s majority ownership of G.M.

Germany’s ties to Russia, which Mrs. Merkel has cultivated, are also at stake. Germany is Russia’s largest trading partner and Berlin is Moscow’s closest advocate in the European Union.

Germany’s opposition to private equity investors like RHJ International, based in Belgium, have also colored the talks.

If no deal is reached, G.M. could choose to retain ownership of Opel and try to raise new capital, according to the people with knowledge of its plans.

But Fred Irwin, chairman of the German government-backed trust created in the spring to facilitate a sale, said G.M could not afford to retain control of the division because it needed to concentrate on the United States market.

“They just have to get their house in order and I think they definitely know this,” Mr. Irwin, who is also president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, told Bloomberg News.

Another person close to the talks said attempts were being made to address G.M.’s concerns over patents and technology transfers in a revised contract.

But on Tuesday, the person put Magna’s chances versus the RHJ International bid at 50-50. “G.M. is out to get the best possible deal,” the person said.

G.M. still relies on Opel for vehicles that it sells worldwide, and its engineers have worked on platforms for vehicles in G.M.’s lineup. When it reorganized its operations this summer, G.M. said it would put more focus on operations in Asia and elsewhere in the world.

Under the current arrangement, initially reached in May, Magna International and Sberbank would buy 55 percent of Opel, each holding a half interest. G.M. would retain a 35 percent stake and Opel employees would acquire 10 percent.

The consortium has agreed to invest 500 million euros while the federal government and four German states where Opel plants are based have agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees.

More than 10,000 G.M. jobs, of 50,000 in Europe, would be eliminated, including 3,000 in Germany. The four plants in Germany would remain open.

The deal would benefit Russia as well. Sberbank is allied with the Russian automaker Gaz, which is owned by Oleg V. Deripaska, whose business empire has suffered in the global financial crisis. The Magna deal could revive Mr. Deripaska’s own struggling automaker. And for the Kremlin, it could be an ideal way to modernize Russia’s car industry.

Analysts say a major weakness of the deal, besides the murky Kremlin connection, is that Magna has never made cars.

RHJ, an industrial holding company, has offered 275 million euros for a 50.1 percent stake, with G.M retaining 39.9 percent and 10 percent put aside for the employees. RHJ is seeking about 3.8 billion euros in state aid and says it will return the company to profitability in 2011.

Arnaud Denis, a spokesman for RHJ, said that it was “still in the race” despite Mrs. Merkel’s support for Magna.
686 2009-08-26 The government index is based on price information from mortgages acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government’s housing finance arms, which means it has fewer high-priced houses than Case-Shiller.

As recently as six months ago, there was widespread expectation that housing prices, which were already down nearly a third from their peaks, would tumble another 10 percent. That decline would most likely have prompted another round of foreclosures, perhaps helping to delay a recovery in the broader economy.

Now, said Mr. Case, it is likely such a grim event will be averted. “Banks will stabilize their balance sheets more quickly. The toxic paper will get written off more quickly,” he said. “That’s a big, big deal.”

The news comes on the heels of the National Association of Realtors’ report on July sales volume, which showed a 5 percent rise above the pace in July 2008. It was the first year-over-year gain since the market peaked in November 2005.

The improving real estate market is a combination of many factors: federal and local government assistance for first-time buyers, receding fears that an economic depression is at hand, low interest rates and, above all, cheaper prices than have been seen in many cities for a long time.

Jessi Havel, a library technician, and Ben Meyer, a university faculty assistant, love San Francisco but thought they were condemned to rent forever. Then friends pointed out that their $2,000 in rent would cover quite a bit of mortgage in a city where prices were back to where they were in mid-2000.

“It seemed like this was our one and only chance to buy here,” said Ms. Havel, 30. So in June they did, paying $456,000 for a cottage in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Mission Terrace.

Ms. Havel and Mr. Meyer benefited from a city loan program for first-time buyers. Ilse Cordoni, president of the San Francisco Association of Realtors, said such assistance, whether city, state or federal, was providing crucial support.

Loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, originally designed for the working poor, used to be practically unknown in San Francisco, Ms. Cordoni said. Now they are popular, since they require only a 3 percent down payment.

“Government help is really helping,” she said.

For all the improvement reflected in the new Case-Shiller report, housing prices are still down sharply in comparison to last year’s figures. The increases reported on Tuesday show up when June’s transaction prices are compared with those of the month before. But when this June is compared with June of 2008, the 20-city composite index is still down 15.4 percent — an improvement from the 19.1 price decline of last winter. Average home prices are now at the level they were in early 2003.

The Case-Shiller index, the most closely watched home price index, is usually reported without any seasonal adjustments. Since home-buying traditionally is strongest in the spring, that prompted criticism with last month’s report that the long-awaited improvements were less hopeful than they seemed.

But even on a seasonally adjusted basis, the index was up 0.7 percent in June. It was the first such increase since May 2006. Instead of 18 cities increasing in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis only 15 did. The two best-performing cities, Cleveland and San Francisco, were up 3.3 percent and 3.1 percent respectively after adjusting.

“The interaction between falling home prices with high household debt loads was the trigger point for the 2007-8 financial crisis, resulting in both the longest and deepest recession in postwar history,” he wrote in a research note. “Now, though, it would appear that the tide is turning.”

S.& P. also released on Tuesday the national Case-Shiller index, which covers a sample of homes across the country, including rural areas and smaller cities. That index increased 2.9 percent in the second quarter, indicating that the recovery extended beyond the urban centers. It was the first quarter-over-quarter increase in three years.

In the 20-city index, the New York metro area ranked far back in the pack, increasing only 0.4 percent in June. The two cities that declined were Detroit and Las Vegas, among the most economically troubled places in the country. Las Vegas prices are now down 54.3 percent from their peak. Detroit has fallen 45.3 percent.

After the back-to-back increases in the 20-city composite for May and June, there is little doubt that the market has picked up. The debate is now shifting to whether the upturn can be sustained.

Analysts note that some sales are probably due to a rush to buy in advance of the December expiration of an $8,000 first-time buyers’ tax credit. The National Association of Realtors is lobbying to have the credit extended or broadened, but neither is a sure thing.

“The tax credit may be shifting sales forward,” said Patrick Newport, United States economist for IHS Global Insight. “There are also unintended effects that could hurt the market. It’s stimulating construction, but we have too many homes already.”

Foreclosures are another big unknown. Prices were pushed down last year by an abundance of bank-owned properties hitting the market. This spring, fewer foreclosures have prompted bidding wars. But with unemployment nearing 10 percent, there are probably more foreclosures to come.
687 2009-08-26 OF all the grilling gurus in my life, from my fire-happy mother (who thinks nothing of grilling lamb chops in January) to the big-time grilling maven Waldy Malouf (with whom I wrote a cookbook), the grill master who made the deepest impression was my childhood pediatrician, Dr. Arthur Ruby.

Dr. Ruby was a close family friend and partner in gustatory delights. In winter he brought over pots of gelatinous p’tcha (stewed calves’ feet) that we ate with challah to sop up the shimmering, garlicky broth. Summertime meant weekends at the Rubys’ second home in Cold Spring, N.Y., where Dr. Ruby had a stone grill built into the patio.

Our Saturday-night dinner menu never varied. After nibbling on baked brie strewn with canned fried onions, there were always clams, grilled until their pink bellies were steaming hot and slightly smoky, but still raw, with a crisp bite and soft center.

Then, Dr. Ruby artfully grilled a two-inch-thick porterhouse until it was salt-crunchy and charred on the outside but still bloody within. Fresh corn, tomato salad with basil, and hot bread and butter rounded out the offerings.

Naturally, the star of the meal was that steak. But the flavor I most associate with those hot, hammock-swinging days is that of briny, smoky clams.

Dr. Ruby had a particular way of preparing them. He would scrub them well and shuck each one. Then he would carefully lay the clams directly on the grill, taking care not to spill precious drops of clam juice into the fiery grate. Exactly one minute later, the clams were ready. We slurped them down, burning our fingers on the hot shells.

705 2009-08-27 As the recession took hold, most Americans cut back on volunteer work and other civic activities, according to a survey conducted for the National Conference on Citizenship.

That finding undercuts anecdotal reports of volunteers’ flooding nonprofit groups as unemployment has increased and suggests the challenges faced by the Obama administration, Congress and foundations working to encourage greater volunteer service and civic participation.

“They’re not saying they’ve stopped volunteering, but they are cutting back on the time spent on volunteering and civic engagement,” said David Smith, executive director of the National Conference on Citizenship, which conducted the survey as part of a study titled America’s Civic Health Index,

The conference has produced the index for the last four years, though it has compiled similar data going back to 1975. Mr. Smith noted that the survey of 3,889 people was done in May, a low point in the economic slide.

“That was really when we started to see how badly people are hurting,” he said.

Still, Mr. Smith said the results came as a surprise because in previous downturns, the survey had shown an increase in civic engagement. He said the only other time its index had fallen was during the recession in the early 1980s.
706 2009-08-27 DETROIT — Chrysler and Nissan said on Wednesday that they were dropping plans to build vehicles that would fill holes in each other’s model lineups now that Chrysler has access to small cars made by its Italian partner, Fiat.

The decision could lead Nissan to withdraw from the highly competitive and profitable large-pickup segment, one analyst said, though Nissan said it was committed to that market.

Chrysler had planned to build a replacement for the Nissan Titan starting in 2011. The Titan is by far the worst-selling full-size truck, accounting for just 1.7 percent of the segment.

“Nissan’s kind of left hanging in the pickup truck segment,” said Erich Merkle, president of Autoconomy.com in Grand Rapids, Mich. “I don’t know that they’ll be able to remain there. The Titan’s pretty tired right now.”

Nissan had planned to supply Chrysler with a compact sedan based on the Nissan Versa for the South American market this year and a small car — the Dodge Hornet — for North America and Europe starting next year. The deals were reached in early 2008.
707 2009-08-27 So many polysilicon and wind turbine factories are already well along in construction across China that the new rules limiting new entrants to the industry still may not prevent further sharp increases in capacity over the coming year — with further downward pressure on prices.

Dr. Shi, who speaks fluent English and conducts interviews in that language, said on Wednesday that Suntech’s operations in the United States had been losing money since they started in 2005, but he attributed losses to operating expenses at the 54-employee American subsidiary.

He said the price that Suntech charged for each solar panel more than covered the production costs and therefore was above the marginal cost. But the administrative costs of running the subsidiary are fairly high on a per-module basis because the company is still building sales. The marginal cost of selling manufactured goods is the cost of producing one additional unit — typically the incremental cost of materials, assembly and shipping — excluding virtually all administrative costs.

Asked twice in a recent interview in Wuxi, China, whether Suntech was selling below “marginal cost” in the United States, Dr. Shi replied that the company was doing so to build market share. Those comments were reported in The New York Times on Tuesday and prompted Dr. Shi’s call, in which he said, “I misunderstood your question.”

Dr. Shi predicted that Suntech’s American operations might become profitable in 2010 if sales increased fast enough to spread the administrative costs across more modules.

His revised remarks underlined the attentiveness of Chinese solar panel makers to complaints from Western manufacturers about China’s lower prices and rising market share.

German solar panel makers have been outspoken in the last week in criticizing the low prices of Chinese imports and questioning whether imported panels should be eligible for subsidies.

Suntech had a gross profit margin on worldwide sales — sales minus the cost of goods sold — of 18.6 percent in the second quarter, he added.

Selling below marginal cost can be a sign of dumping, or selling goods in a foreign market for less than the cost of production. But it is not the only indicator, and it is hard to prove a case unless imports are rising rapidly and domestic companies are losing money. Chinese shipments of solar panels to the United States are rising, but American companies are also benefiting from renewed interest in their products.

A leading international trade lawyer in Washington, Alan Wm. Wolff of Dewey & LeBoeuf, wrote in an e-mail message that winning an antidumping case on solar panels would be a challenge.

“Antidumping cases against products from China have to date largely covered traditional, basic products such as chemicals and steel,” Mr. Wolff wrote. “A case against solar panels from China would be a landmark case.”

Dr. Shi said that Suntech had not engaged in dumping, adding that he believed other Chinese companies in various industries had been wrongly accused of dumping in Europe. He also said that Suntech had bought more than 500 million euros ($712 million) worth of manufacturing equipment from Germany in the last five or six years and had more than 150 employees there.
708 2009-08-27 On walls and window sills, and tucked into neat stacks, are pieces that deal with “the physics of liquid formation,” as he calls some of his earlier work. The pieces were influenced by his long association with leading graffiti artists at Fashion Moda.

He realized that the spots left by quick spray bursts looked lifelike. One resembles a group of tiny, fluorescent pink horseshoe crabs. In another piece, he let green paint flow into white, resulting in a latticework resembling moss.

“The physics of liquid formation are the physics of biology,” he said. “This is a liquid formation. But it is also moss. Same thing. That is why I became an artist, to investigate and find new bounds of knowledge.”

He goes to the narrow hallway and hauls out a slab of plywood onto which he had let brown paint flow.

“This is the ‘Monkey Donkey’ thing,” he said. “It’s monkey rides donkey. Totally random. That in itself is totally amazing. I did this and this happened. This is miraculous to me.”

Mr. Eins’s work has been exhibited at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens, in Vienna and in Kyrgyzstan, where he has curated two shows and plans another this year. Writing in Art in America in 2000, David Ebony described Mr. Eins’s spray paint splatters as “spare and lyrical” and “poignant.”

In the last few years, he has been working closer to home. In August 2006 he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital for a facelift. When he awoke the next morning, he looked out the window and saw — his face. The early-morning sun was casting a shadow that actually resembled his angular profile. He returned there on a recent Saturday to document the shadow with a photograph. In one shot, a weathered copper cornice looks like a crown.

“I immediately identified with it,” he said. “It looked like me. It also had this crown thing. This king thing. Not that I want to be a king, because kings oppress other people. Whatever.”

His other recent project can be found right in his neighborhood, along the streets near Marcus Garvey Park. That was where he found “Slavery,” a green paint spot that looks like either a person collapsed on the ground, or a torso raising a clenched fist.

A cognitive psychologist would say his mind is only seeking patterns he is predisposed to find. Mr. Eins says that may be true, but adds that the patterns may not have been accidental. Maybe he is operating on another dimension beyond the usual limits of time and space, he suggested.

“Naturally, you have the artist’s vision,” he said. “You just can’t go out and find these everywhere.”

Not that many people stop to look. Juan Urena and his son, Juan Jr., were standing on the green spot one morning when they were told that it was actually art.

“What’s it look like to you, Papi?” he asked his son.

“It looks like a hand, to me,” the father said. “More or less.”

But another passer-by kept right on going, concerned about a whole different kind of order among chaos.

“Come here!” she said, walking right past the spot as she chased after a wandering toddler. “Come. Here.”

“I got to watch him,” she said, as she walked away. “I got to watch him.”
709 2009-08-27 Mr. Potter loved his office, his executive salary, his bonus, his stock options. “How can I walk away from a job that pays me so well?” he wondered. But at the age of 56, he announced his and left Cigna last year.

This year, he went public with his concerns, testifying before a Senate committee investigating the insurance industry.

“I knew that once I did that my life would be different,” he said. “I wouldn’t be getting any more calls from recruiters for the health industry. It was the scariest thing I have done in my life. But it was the right thing to do.”

Mr. Potter says he liked his colleagues and bosses in the insurance industry, and respected them. They are not evil. But he adds that they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, as he was, and are obsessed with sustaining the company’s stock price — which means paying fewer medical bills.

One way to do that is to deny requests for expensive procedures. A second is “rescission” — seizing upon a technicality to cancel the policy of someone who has been paying premiums and finally gets or some other expensive disease. A Congressional investigation into rescission found that three insurers, including Blue Cross of California, used this technique to cancel more than 20,000 policies over five years, saving the companies $300 million in claims.

As The Los Angeles Times has reported, insurers encourage this approach through performance evaluations. One Blue Cross employee earned a perfect evaluation score after dropping thousands of policyholders who faced nearly $10 million in medical expenses.

Mr. Potter notes that a third tactic is for insurers to raise premiums for a small business astronomically after an employee is found to have an illness that will be very expensive to treat. That forces the business to drop coverage for all its employees or go elsewhere.

All this is monstrous, and it negates the entire point of insurance, which is to spread risk.

The insurers are open to one kind of reform — universal coverage through mandates and subsidies, so as to give them more customers and more profits. But they don’t want the reforms that will most help patients, such as a public insurance option, enforced competition and tighter regulation.

Mr. Potter argues that much tougher regulation is essential. He also believes that a robust public option is an essential part of any health reform, to compete with for-profit insurers and keep them honest.

As a nation, we’re at a turning point. Universal health coverage has been proposed for nearly a century in the . It was in an early draft of .

Yet each time, it has been defeated in part by fear-mongering industry lobbyists. That may happen this time as well — unless the Obama administration and Congress defeat these manipulative special interests. What’s un-American isn’t a greater government role in health care but an existing system in which Americans without insurance get health care, if at all, in livestock pens.
710 2009-08-27 “It’s certain that there are increased rates of cancer at low levels of radiation, and as you increase the levels of radiation, you increase cancer,” said Dr. Redberg, who was not connected with the new study.

The radioactive tests are given for hundreds of purposes. In the last two decades, they have become especially common in cardiology, where physicians use them to check for the buildup of plaque in the arteries and the heart’s ability to pump blood.

Some cardiologists now encourage their patients to have routine heart scans even if they do not have clinical symptoms of heart disease, like chest pain or shortness of breath. The study did not examine what percentage of the tests were medically necessary.

The use of the tests has risen sharply in the last two decades, as more and more physicians have bought CT and PET scanners and installed them in or near their offices. In 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that the number of CT scans given to Medicare patients had almost quadrupled from 1995 to 2005, while the number of PET scans had risen even faster.

The new study’s lead author, Dr. Reza Fazel, a cardiologist at Emory University, said the use of scans appeared to have increased even from 2005 to 2007, the period covered by the paper.

“These procedures have a cost, not just in terms of dollars, but in terms of radiation risk,” Dr. Fazel said.

The researchers calculated the amount of radiation received by the patients by looking at insurance codes for various kinds of imaging tests. Exposure is measured in millisieverts; the average American receives about three millisieverts a year from all sources.

The paper found that in at least one of the three years, 1.9 percent of the UnitedHealthcare patients received at least 20 millisieverts of radiation, or nearly seven times the average. Of that group, about 10 percent, or 0.2 percent of all patients, received at least 50 millisieverts, more than the annual maximum that nuclear regulators allow.

Those figures suggest that about four million Americans receive cumulative doses exceeding 20 millisieverts a year.

Federal rules allow physicians to profit from the use of machines they own or lease. But Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale and an author of the paper, said financial incentives were only part of the reason the number of tests had risen so fast.

“I think the central driver is more about culture than anything else,” Dr. Krumholz said. “People use imaging instead of examining the patient; they use imaging instead of talking to the patient.

“Patients should be asking the question: ‘Do I really need this test? Is the information in this test going to help in the decision-making process?’ ”

In many cases, there is little evidence that the routine use of scans helps physicians make better decisions, especially in cases where the treatments that follow are also of questionable efficacy.

In an editorial accompanying the paper, Dr. Michael S. Lauer, director of prevention and epidemiology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, called for large clinical trials that would assess whether the scans improve care and lead to better outcomes for patients.

“Were we to insist that all, or nearly all, procedures be studied in well-designed trials, we could answer many critical clinical questions,” Dr. Lauer wrote.

Until then, patients and physicians should discuss the risk of the tests and keep close track of the overall radiation dose that patients are receiving, he wrote, adding, “We have to think and talk explicitly about the elements of danger in exposing our patients to radiation.”
711 2009-08-27 Human rights advocates and Chinese lawyers say that the office assistant of a prominent rights lawyer probably was not freed by the government over the weekend, as some of the advocates had originally said. They said it was unclear whether the assistant was in detention or had been released but remained under some sort of restriction. The assistant, Zhuang Lu, 27, worked at the Gongmeng legal center, which has tried to represent downtrodden Chinese citizens in cases that often involve official corruption. Ms. Zhuang and a founder of Gongmeng, Xu Zhiyong, were taken from their homes by security forces on July 29. Mr. Xu was released on Sunday.

Several rights advocates said Mr. Xu had been told by officials that Ms. Zhuang had also been released. But Teng Biao, another founder of Gongmeng, said Wednesday night that Ms. Zhuang’s mother had just received a brief, cryptic call from her daughter, who said she was awaiting trial and was not allowed to leave Beijing.
712 2009-08-27 Moscow is concerned that future North Korean missile tests could go awry, sending debris into Russian territory, and it is considering using surface-to-air missiles to protect against such “failed test launches,” Gen. Nikolai Makarov, the chief of Russia’s general staff, said during a visit to Mongolia on Wednesday. Moscow has stepped up its criticism of North Korea since May, when the North carried out an underground nuclear test, though Russian officials stopped short of endorsing the toughest sanctions favored by Washington. General Makarov told the Interfax news service that a battalion equipped with an antimissile system was already deployed near Russia’s short border with North Korea. “We are concerned by the fact that the site in North Korea, where it carries out its nuclear tests, is located quite close to the Russian border,” he said.

Dogfighting is still a problem in Philadelphia, where authorities broke up another ring Sunday after finding two dead pit bulls and several others injured during a house raid.

CUTLER CHANGES TUNE Now that they have been separated for five months, Bears quarterback Jay Cutler has high praise for the Broncos’ rookie coach, Josh McDaniels, whom he will see in a preseason game at Invesco Field on Sunday.

In the brief time he spent with McDaniels, Cutler said, he could tell that he was an offensive mastermind. Cutler said the Broncos were in good hands with McDaniels and quarterback Kyle Orton.

“He’s going to be a good coach,” Cutler told Denver reporters in a conference call. “I think their offense is going to be fine. I think Kyle’s going to be fine.”

The Broncos traded Cutler to Chicago for Orton and three draft picks in April because of Cutler’s rift with McDaniels.

BOLDIN OUT Arizona wide receiver Anquan Boldin sat out practice with a sore right hamstring and will probably miss the Cardinals’ game against Green Bay on Friday night. Coach Ken Whisenhunt said Boldin felt a problem with the hamstring late in practice Tuesday; a magnetic resonance imaging exam showed no serious injury.

The Cardinals may also be without wide receiver Steve Breaston, who has been sidelined with a bruised knee. If both miss the game, Jerheme Urban will move up to No. 2 receiver behind Larry Fitzgerald.

Arizona is expected to have the rookie running back Beanie Wells, who missed the first two preseason games with a sprained ankle.

NINERS’ HILL TAKES A BREAK Shaun Hill left the San Francisco 49ers’ practice after throwing one pass Wednesday morning but said he was fine and would be ready to play against the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday. Hill has earned the nod as the starting quarterback, beating out Alex Smith.

Hill strained his lower back during practice Tuesday and received treatment.

BILLS BREATHE EASIER Bills running back Fred Jackson was feeling better Wednesday. His sprained left wrist should not cause him to miss the start of the season. Although his wrist and thumb were too sore to allow him to practice, Jackson said tests showed no serious injury a day after he took a hit on his left hand during a running play.

CABLE TO BE QUESTIONED ESPN reported that the Napa, Calif., police department planned to question Oakland Raiders Coach Tom Cable about his possible role in a fight that injured the Raiders assistant Randy Hanson. A police department representative said Cable would be interviewed as part of the investigation, according to ESPN.

714 2009-08-27 HOPING to reach children at school and shoppers at the store, a growing number of national brands are turning to an old medium: milk cartons.

The ads on the smallest cartons, the half-pints that are distributed through school lunch programs, are aimed at children. Larger containers, like gallon jugs, are intended to reach the adults who do the shopping for their households — the people who decide whether to pick up a box of brownie mix or try a new cereal.

Milk cartons have long been used as billboards, though the messages have evolved. In the early 1980s, cartons showed pictures of missing children, but those campaigns have moved to the Internet. Dairies promote milk on packaging and have done campaigns for local brands and sports teams. With myriad ads showing up in stores this summer — for Stouffer’s frozen dinners, a new “Pinocchio” DVD and Cheerios — milk is increasingly a platform for national brands, said Chris Barkley, president of the advertising company BoxTop Media.

BoxTop focuses on products with “an affiliation with milk,” namely, Mr. Barkley said, “all the big cereal players and the cookie players.” General Mills promoted Cheerios with stickers on gallon jugs, and Kraft nudged shoppers toward the snack aisle with ads for Honey Maid graham crackers. In stores in New York and other major American markets this summer, stickers appeared promoting Duncan Hines with a photo of brownies and the text: “Cold Milk, Warm Brownies, mmmmmmmm.”

Audiences may have scattered to cable, Facebook, Google News and Hulu, but the milk jug is one mass medium that still reaches the masses. For each person in the United States, more than 20 gallons of milk is produced each year, according to the most recent data from the Agriculture Department. Gary A. Hemphill of the Beverage Marketing Corporation, an industry group, says milk is unique in that it is a bottled drink and also an ingredient for baking and cereal. “It finds its way into most refrigerators in the homes of Americans,” he said.

Appeals to this vast audience can also home in on specific demographics. Stickers on low-fat milk would be more likely to reach consumers with above-average incomes and educations, according to Beverage Marketing, and whole-milk drinkers tend to be younger. This helps to explain the BoxTop Media ads that don’t have clear ties to milk, like the stickers featuring USA Today and children’s series like “Sid the Science Kid.” A gallon of milk is the place to be, Mr. Barkley said, “if you want to reach moms with large households.”
715 2009-08-27 That’s all changed. SABMiller and Molson Coors kicked off a joint venture last year that combines the market powers of the second- and third-largest players. InBev, meantime, has no stomach for a price war after its $52 billion debt-financed splurge on Anheuser.

The Obama administration is taking a tougher line on monopolistic behavior. Christine Varney, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, has even signaled a willingness to re-examine deals that were approved under the Bush administration.

Taking on Big Beer might be politically popular. Moreover, there’s precedent for doing so. Years ago, the Justice Department sued to prevent the merger of Pabst, then the 10th-largest brewer, with the 18th biggest, Blatz. The case went to the Supreme Court, which in 1966 ruled the deal was anticompetitive and forced Pabst to divest Blatz.

That’s not an outcome shareholders of SABMiller, Molson Coors or Anheuser-Busch InBev would toast with pleasure.

What good is it to be right if you’re all alone? President Nicolas Sarkozy of France wants his country to lead the world by example in restricting bankers’ bonuses. As usual, Mr. Sarkozy is deploying populism in his latest campaign to “moralize capitalism.”

He’s basically right on substance. He has forced French banks to agree to a code of conduct, threatening to pull government business if they don’t respect it. But Mr. Sarkozy will be fighting a losing battle unless he persuades his partners in the Group of 20 leading industrialized nations to follow suit.

The new code is in line with the general principles agreed at the G-20 meeting last April. French banks will spread bonus payments over three years, with part paid out in shares. There will be a clause empowering banks to claw back payments if the business that originally generated the bonuses turns sour. Furthermore, the banks promise more transparency on how much is paid in bonuses and how they are calculated.

Like many voters and some politicians, the president is appalled by what he calls “the return of bad habits” in banking. He wants to put an end to the era of profits for a few and risks for all which left taxpayers footing the bill for bankers’ excesses.

But there are two risks to Mr. Sarkozy’s stand on bonuses. The first is that it opens up a Pandora’s box of hypocrisies, where banks and their lawyers will rush to find ways to circumvent the new rules. The second is that other countries, primarily the United States and Britain, remain cool to the French approach. Actual implementation of the G-20 agreement has been slow, as most governments refrain from legislating on bonuses.

Mr. Sarkozy is trying the regulation-in-one-country route at a time when he also says he wants to raise Paris’s profile as a financial center. At some point, he may come to realize he can’t do both.
716 2009-08-27 A West Virginia chemical plant where two workers were killed in an explosion last year said Thursday that it would substantially cut production of a toxic chemical there.

A federal official said the move would “lessen the risk to the public and the work force.”

The chemical, methyl isocyanate, or MIC, was the poison released at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, killing thousands.

The owner of the West Virginia plant, Bayer Cropscience, had rejected calls to eliminate or reduce the production of MIC, saying it had never been involved in an accident there. But Bill Buckner, the company’s president and chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday that an 80 percent cut in MIC production was being made because “we have taken seriously the concerns of public officials and the site’s neighbors.”

The change is part of a $25 million safety upgrade at the plant that includes eliminating all above-ground storage of MIC within a year. Last year’s explosion at the plant, in Institute, W. Va., near Charleston, sent some projectiles toward an above-ground MIC tank, where 40,000 pounds of the chemical can be stored. The plant also has an underground tank that can store up to 200,000 pounds of MIC. Estimates from Bhopal were that 50,000 to 90,000 pounds of MIC were released in that accident.

The proximity of the Bayer explosion to the above-ground tank concerned investigators from the federal Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, who have spent most of the past year looking into the accident.

“Any measures by Bayer to reduce the inventory of MIC at the facility are a positive development,” John Bresland, the chemical board chairman whose agency expects to release its final report on the accident sometime next year, said in a statement. “If implemented in a careful and conscientious manner, the steps Bayer has outlined will lessen the risk to the public and the work force from an uncontrolled release of MIC.”
717 2009-08-27 When Greg Hare looked into putting solar panels on his ranch-style home in Magnolia, Tex., last year, he decided he could not afford it. “I had no idea solar was so expensive,” he recalled.

But the cost of solar panels has plunged lately, changing the economics for many homeowners. Mr. Hare ended up paying $77,000 for a large solar setup that he figures might have cost him $100,000 a year ago.

“I just thought, ‘Wow, this is an opportunity to do the most for the least,’ ” Mr. Hare said.

For solar shoppers these days, the price is right. Panel prices have fallen about 40 percent since the middle of last year, driven down partly by an increase in the supply of a crucial ingredient for panels, according to analysts at the investment bank Piper Jaffray.

The price drops  coupled with recently expanded federal incentives  could shrink the time it takes solar panels to pay for themselves to 16 years, from 22 years, in places with high electricity costs, according to Glenn Harris, chief executive of SunCentric, a solar consulting group. That calculation does not include state rebates, which can sometimes improve the economics considerably.

American consumers have the rest of the world to thank for the big solar price break.

Until recently, panel makers had been constrained by limited production of polysilicon, which goes into most types of panels. But more factories making the material have opened, as have more plants churning out the panels themselves  especially in China.

“A ton of production, mostly Chinese, has come online,” said Chris Whitman, the president of U.S. Solar Finance, which helps arrange bank financing for solar projects.

At the same time, once-roaring global demand for solar panels has slowed, particularly in Europe, the largest solar market, where photovoltaic installations are forecast to fall by 26 percent this year compared with 2008, according to Emerging Energy Research, a consulting firm. Much of that drop can be attributed to a sharp slowdown in Spain. Faced with high unemployment and an economic crisis, Spain slashed its generous subsidy for the panels last year because it was costing too much.

Many experts expect panel prices to fall further, though not by another 40 percent.

Manufacturers are already reeling from the price slump. For example, Evergreen Solar, which is based in Massachusetts, recently reported a second-quarter loss that was more than double its loss from a year earlier.

But some manufacturers say that cheaper panels could be a good thing in the long term, spurring enthusiasm among customers and expanding the market.

“It’s important that these costs and prices do come down,” said Mike Ahearn, the chief executive of First Solar, a panel maker based in Tempe, Ariz.

First Solar recently announced a deal to build two large solar arrays in Southern California to supply that region’s dominant utility. But across the United States, the installation of large solar systems  the type found on commercial or government buildings  has been hurt by financing problems, and is on track to be about the same this year as in 2008, according to Emerging Energy Research.

The smaller residential sector continues to grow: In California, by far the largest market in the country, residential installations in July were up by more than 50 percent compared with a year earlier. With prices dropping, that momentum looks poised to continue.

John Berger, chief executive of Standard Renewable Energy, the company in Houston that put panels on Mr. Hare’s home, said that his second-quarter sales rose by more than 225 percent from the first quarter.

“Was that as a product of declining panel prices? Almost certainly yes,” Mr. Berger said.

Expanded federal incentives have also helped spur the market. Until this year, homeowners could get a 30 percent tax credit for solar electric installations, but it was capped at $2,000. That cap was lifted on Jan. 1.

Mr. Hare in Texas cited the larger tax credit, which sliced about $23,000 from his $77,000 bill, as a major factor in his decision to go solar, in addition to the falling panel prices. Sensing a good deal, he even got a larger system than he had originally planned  going from 42 panels to 64. The electric bill on his 7,000-square-foot house and garage has typically run $600 to $700 a month, but he expects a reduction of 40 to 80 percent.

Mr. Berger predicts that with panel prices falling and the generous federal credit in place, utilities will start lowering rebates they offer to homeowners who put panels on their roofs.

One that has already done so is the Salt River Project, the main utility in Phoenix, which cut its homeowners’ rebate by 10 percent in June. Lori Singleton, the utility’s sustainability manager, said the utility had recently spent more than it budgeted for solar power, a result of a surge in demand as more solar installers moved into Arizona and government incentives kicked in.

California has been steadily bringing down its rebates. An impending 29 percent cut in rebates offered within the service area of Pacific Gas and Electric, the dominant utility in Northern California, means that “with the module price drop over the last few months, it is pretty much a wash,” Bill Stewart, president of SolarCraft, an installer in Novato, Calif., said in an e-mail message.

Even if falling rebates cancel out some of the solar panel price slump, more innovative financing strategies are also helping to make solar affordable for homeowners. This year about a dozen states  following moves by California and Colorado last year  have enacted laws enabling solar panels to be paid off gradually, through increased property taxes, after a municipality first shoulders the upfront costs.

Some installers have adopted similar approaches. Danita Hardy, a homeowner in Phoenix, had been put off by the prospect of spending $20,000 for solar panels  until she spotted a news item about a company called SunRun that takes on the upfront expense and recovers its costs gradually, in a lease deal, essentially through the savings in a homeowner’s electric bill.

“I thought well, heck, this might be doable,” said Ms. Hardy, who wound up having to lay out only $800 to get 15 solar panels for her home.
718 2009-08-27 BERLIN — Four weeks before national elections, Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to be trying to hold on to her lead in the public opinion polls by keeping the campaign as lackluster as possible. But that has not prevented the political opposition from seizing on any sniff of scandal to try to enliven the campaign.

Mrs. Merkel, a sober public presence, has been untouched by any hint of corruption since taking office in late 2005. Even so, her opponents are trying to score points by pouncing on a dinner party she hosted 16 months ago that included the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, and 30 other guests, contending that she used taxpayers’ money to celebrate Mr. Ackermann’s 60th birthday.

After the issue bubbled up in a closed-door session of the budget committee in Parliament, Mrs. Merkel went on the offensive Wednesday with an unusual appearance on the commercial television channel N24/Sat.1. She insisted that the dinner “was not a birthday party,” but a dinner of schnitzel and cold asparagus for people prominent in business, culture, science and education, including Mr. Ackermann.

Aware that voters contending with unemployment and the worst recession in decades are critical of high wages for business leaders, particularly bankers, Mrs. Merkel said she was very “sensitive” about keeping politics and business separate.

But the Social Democrats — who are currently Mrs. Merkel’s coalition partners but rivals in the election scheduled for Sept. 27 — and opposition parties questioned the financing of the event from the Chancellery’s entertainment budget, suggesting it should have been treated as a private affair in the first place.
719 2009-08-27 “It’s kind of exciting to play,” said Coin, who is from France and graduated from Clemson University with a degree in mathematics. “That’s what you want to do, you want to go on the WTA Tour to play tennis. You don’t want to keep playing challengers every year. You get to make more money.”

Throughout her match against Ivanovic, Coin said, she kept waiting for Ivanovic to make a charge. But Ivanovic, who was battling a thumb injury, never mounted one. Suddenly, Coin was serving for the match. She double-faulted.

Coin won on her third match point.

“I never realized that I beat a No. 1,” Coin said. “She was No. 1 in the world, but if I had beaten some of my idols from when I was younger, maybe it would have been different because I kind of started at the same time as her. She started on the tour at the same time that I did. It was different.”

Coin lost in the third round to Amélie Mauresmo, also from France, but left the Open with $45,262 in prize money — nearly half her career earnings.

“When I went back to my city, it was crazy,” Coin said about returning to Amiens, 70 miles north of Paris. “Everywhere I was going, people would see me and say, ‘Oh! We saw you on TV.’ So that was exciting. But that went down really fast.”

With first-round victories this year in two majors — the Australian and the French Opens — Coin will have another chance next week to catch her hometown’s attention. Unlike last year, when she had to qualify for the United States Open, her ranking this year was high enough to assure her a spot in the field. The draw will be announced Thursday.

For now, she is warming up at the Bronx Open with other United States Open qualifiers. She defeated Galina Voskoboeva of Kazakhstan, 6-3, 6-3, in the second round Wednesday.

“For sure, I’m a little bit more confident,” Coin said. “We can see that every day, not only with me but all of the girls, anybody can beat anybody.”
720 2009-08-27 Microsoft’s, called Windows 7, comes out in October. Apple’s, called Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, arrives on Friday, a month earlier than announced. (Apple to Microsoft: )

Apple’s release strategy is highly unorthodox: “Leopard, a k a Mac OS X 10.5, was already a great OS-virus-free, nag-free and not copy-protected. So instead of adding features for their own sake, let’s just make what we’ve got smaller, faster and more refined.”

What? No new features? That’s not how the industry works! Doesn’t Apple know anything?

And then there’s the price of Snow Leopard: $30.

Have they lost their minds? Operating-system upgrades always cost a hundred-something dollars! ($30 is the price if you already have Leopard. If not, the price is $170 for a Mac Box Set that also includes two suites of Apple software: iLife (iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb and the GarageBand studio), and iWork (the Numbers spreadsheet, Pages word processor and Keynote presentation software).

In any case, Snow Leopard truly is an optimized version of Leopard. It starts up faster (72 seconds on a MacBook Air, versus 100 seconds in Leopard). It opens programs faster (Web browser, 3 seconds; calendar, 5 seconds; iTunes, 7 seconds), and the second time you open the same program, the time is halved.

“Optimized” doesn’t just mean faster; it also means smaller. Incredibly, Snow Leopard is only half the size of its predecessor; following the speedy installation (15 minutes), you wind up with 7 gigabytes more free space on your hard drive. That, ladies and gents, is a first.

Unfortunately, Snow Leopard runs only on Macs with chips — that is, Macs sold since 2006. If you have an older Mac, you’re stuck with Leopard forever.

As it turns out, Apple programmers could not leave well enough alone. They disobeyed the original “no new features” mantra. As they pored through all the bits of Mac OS X, they kept stopping and fixing little things that had always bugged them, or coming up with neat little ways to make things better. So:

The Mac now adjusts its own clock when you travel, just like a cellphone. The menu bar can now show the date, not just the day of the week. The menu of nearby wireless hot spots now shows the signal strength for each. When you’re running Windows on your Mac, you can now open the files on the Macintosh “side” without having to restart. Icons can now be 512 pixels (several inches) square, turning any desktop window into a light table for photos.

There’s now a Put Back command in the Trash, just as in Windows’ Recycle Bin. You can page through a PDF document or watch a movie right on a file’s icon. When you click a folder icon on the Dock, you can scroll through the pop-up window of its contents, turning a worthless feature into a useful one.

Buggy plug-ins (Flash and so on) no longer crash the Safari Web browser; you just get an empty rectangle where they would have appeared.

There’s an impressive trove of tools for blind Mac users, including one that turns a Mac laptop’s trackpad into a touchable map of the screen; the Mac speaks each onscreen element as you touch it.

There are some bigger-ticket items, too. Movies open up into a gorgeous, frameless playback window with built-in trim handles and a “Send to ” command built right in. You can now record your screen activity as a movie — fantastic for tutorials. The old Services feature has been reborn as powerful commands that appear only when relevant — and you can modify, make up or assign keystrokes to them.

Once a system administrator provides setup details, your company’s Microsoft Exchange address book, e-mail and calendar can show up in the Mac’s own address book, e-mail and calendar programs, right alongside your own personal information. That’s irony for you: the Mac now has Exchange compatibility built in, but Windows itself does not.

There are hundreds more little tweaks. In all, Apple says that more than 90 percent of Leopard’s 1,000 software chunks were revised or polished. Many are listed on Apple's site, but I kept finding more undocumented surprises until the deadline for this column. Just little stuff. Like: When you rename an icon on an alphabetically sorted desktop, it visibly slides into its new alphabetic position so you can see where it went.

Despite all of this, the haters online deride Snow Leopard as a “service pack” — nothing more than a bug-fix/security-patch update like the ones Microsoft periodically releases for Windows.

That’s a pretty uninformed wisecrack. Especially because the biggest changes in Snow Leopard are under the hood, completely invisible, but responsible for some big speed and stability advances.

A big one: Mac OS X and most of its included programs (the desktop, Web browser, calendar and so on) are 64-bit software, a geeky term that, for now, pretty much means “faster.” Other new underlying technologies, called OpenCL and Grand Central Dispatch, are features that software companies can exploit for even greater speed in their new or rewritten programs.

That Snow Leopard’s looks haven’t changed at all, in other words, betrays the enormous changes under its pretty skin. Unfortunately, that fact also explains the number of non-Apple programs that “break” after the installation.

I experienced frustrating glitches in various programs, including Microsoft Word, Flip4Mac, Photoshop CS3, CyberDuck and TextExpander, an abbreviation expander. (Interestingly, Snow Leopard offers its own typing-expander feature, but it works primarily in Apple programs, like TextEdit, Mail, Safari and iChat.) The compatibility list at lists other programs that may have trouble.

Most of these will go away when software companies update their wares (although says, “Just upgrade to Photoshop CS4”). Let’s hope that Apple hurries up with its inevitable 10.6.0.1 update, too, to address the occasional Safari crash and cosmetic glitch I experienced, too.

Otherwise, if you’re already running Leopard, paying the $30 for Snow Leopard is a no-brainer. You’ll feel the leap forward in speed polish, and you’ll keep experiencing those “oh, that’s nice” moments for weeks to come.

If you’re running something earlier, the decision isn’t as clear cut; you’ll have to pay $170 and get Snow Leopard with Apple’s creative-software suites — whether you want them or not.

Either way, the big story here isn’t really Snow Leopard. It’s the radical concept of a software update that’s smaller, faster and better — instead of bigger, slower and more bloated. May the rest of the industry take the hint.
721 2009-08-27 Clearing the way for the Fox Business Network to simulcast his radio show, Don Imus, below, said Wednesday that he was leaving RFD-TV, the rural television network that has shown “Imus in the Morning” for almost two years. RFD-TV will carry his radio show for the final time on Friday. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Imus said the parties had mutually agreed to end their contract three years before it was set to expire. The shift will not affect Mr. Imus’s radio broadcasts, which are produced by WABC Radio and syndicated by Citadel Broadcasting. Mr. Imus moved to WABC and RFD after being fired by CBS Radio and MSNBC in 2007 for making derogatory racial comments about the Rutgers women’s basketball team. Mr. Imus has been in talks about moving his television simulcast to Fox Business for several weeks. A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday.
722 2009-08-27 Q. The text comes over fine, but some of my Outlook contact pictures won’t copy over to my BlackBerry when I synchronize it with my PC. Any ideas as to why some photos sync up and some don’t?

A. The Outlook contact photos that refuse to synchronize with the BlackBerry might be too large (more than 32 kilobytes) for the smartphone to handle — or in an unsupported file format. If this seems to be the case, try resaving the problem photos as JPEG files at a resolution of 96 dots per inch, with a screen size of 90 pixels by 90 pixels.

Before you resize and resave a bunch of files at once, try this procedure on just one contact photo first to see if it fixes the problem. Import the new photo back into the Outlook contact and synchronize the BlackBerry with the PC to make sure the image shows up on the phone before you do the rest.

Q. This Windows computer I inherited is agonizingly slow. It sounds like an air-conditioner running constantly (as though a program is running which uses all the power), and can take several minutes to go from page to page. How can I speed it up?

A. If the computer has outdated security software — or none at all — try installing some and running it to remove any malicious software that could be hogging the computer’s resources. Plenty of commercial suites are available, but you can also find free basic protection with programs like AVG Free Antivirus (free.avg.com), Avast Antivirus Home Edition (avast.com), Spybot Search & Destroy (safer-networking.org) and Microsoft’s own free Windows Defender (microsoft.com/defender).
724 2009-08-27 In an alliance that signals potential new directions in consumer electronics marketing, Sony and Best Buy have unveiled a range of audio products — including iPod speaker docks and a Blu-ray theater system — that are the result of two years’ collaboration.

With the new line, called Altus, “we’re breaking new ground in the consumer electronics industry,” said Mike Fasulo, Sony’s chief marketing officer, in a statement.

The gear will be sold through Sony’s online store, at Best Buy locations and elsewhere..

So are the products groundbreaking as well? Not really, it appears. A $700 iPod dock with “S-Air” wireless speakers for multiroom use is called the ALT-SA31iR, while a contained speaker dock with an FM tuner costs $400.

And since streaming wireless PC audio is a hot topic these days, Sony is offering two systems: the ALT-SA32PC system connects to a PC via U.S.B. and then wirelessly transmits audio to a pair of speakers. STEPHEN WILLIAMS
725 2009-08-27 The jolts in Linda Oh’s songs arrive early and continue all the way through. A young Chinese-Malaysian bassist raised in Australia, Ms. Oh has been studying and playing around New York for a year and a bit. Unless you’re involved in jazz education, there’s little reason you’d know of her before now, but suddenly you should.

“Entry,” her first album — coming out in early October, through her own label — is music for trio: bass, trumpet and drums. Its pieces rely on vamps, interactive energy and strong melody. They are dry and lean and insistent music, with no hiding places; they borrow some structural and rhythmic notions from Dave Holland’s music of the last few decades and a phrase or two from old bebop, but as it barrels ahead, the music’s fearless energy seems self-generated. It’s not airlessly virtuosic; it’s smart and informed and hard working, full of real improvisation, the committed, hard-won, lumpy, nonmechanical, go-for-broke kind.

Her show at Le Poisson Rouge on Tuesday night — her 25th birthday — was her first performance playing this music. Onstage with her were two of the better young musicians in New York: the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, who is on the album, and the drummer Tommy Crane, who is not. (The drummer on the album is Obed Calvaire, who will join her for a New York gig the week of the album’s release, as well as on a subsequent tour through Australia.)

Ms. Oh doesn’t waste time: the hard, gritty vamp in “Morning Sunset,” built of simple and ominous phrases and chords, made its case right away. The song “201” started with a fast curlicued bebop line, skidded into two bars of halting three-beat rhythm and quickly shifted into a loose, open, melodic bass solo, in which she seemed to be thinking like a horn player. And the long ballad melody of “Patterns,” played with passion by Mr. Akinmusire and harmonized by Ms. Oh, likewise found its almost liquid mood in a hurry.

Usually Mr. Crane played color and funk and details in and around the lines: combined, the bass-drum rhythm in these songs created thoughtful discrepancies, a choreography of feints and sliding suggestions. It all worked because they were both locked into the same groove; they just weren’t necessarily lining out its shape for you.

Midset she picked up her electric bass. Would this be where the showing off began? It was not. She played an instrumental dedicated to her sister, then a cover of Djavan’s folklike “Lambada de Serpente,” singing in Portuguese, with improvising inside vamps. (Ms. Oh has an unremarkable voice and a shaky hold on Portuguese, but she just went and did it, forthrightly.) Neither was jazz, particularly; they sounded like private sketches, investigations of melody. And even though she closed the set with a transforming version of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song — the midtempo “Soul to Squeeze”— this was not jazz trying to be rock. But, often, it rocked. There’s a difference.
726 2009-08-27 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.23 points, or 0.04 percent, to 9,543.52. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index increased 0.12 point, or 0.01 percent, to 1,028.12, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 0.20 point, or 0.01 percent, to 2,024.43.

Declining stocks narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a light 1.05 billion shares, down from 1.14 billion shares at the close of trading on Tuesday.

With trading volume and news flow tapering down amid Wall Street’s annual summer slowdown, analysts say there are few near-term catalysts that could spur the market higher.

For most of the day, stocks seesawed without a clear direction despite a Commerce Department report that said new-home sales rose 9.6 percent in July for the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Sales rose to 433,000, the strongest pace since September and well above the 390,000 figure economists expected.

The Commerce Department said in a separate report that durable goods orders showed the biggest jump since July 2007, as orders for factory goods expected to last at least three years increased 4.9 percent. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting a 3 percent increase.

The major indexes got a lift on Tuesday after data on home prices added to beliefs the battered sector is stabilizing and recovering. The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 1.4 percent in the second quarter, the first quarterly increase in three years. It was the second consecutive month that the price index rose.

Shares of home builders surged for a second day after the housing data showed the supply of new homes on the market fell to the lowest level since April 2007. If supply is decreasing, builders may need to ramp up production.

Hovnanian Enterprises rose 43 cents, or 9.4 percent, to $5. Lennar jumped 61 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $15.58.

Retail stocks were mostly higher after a handful of upbeat earnings reports.

Shares of Dollar Tree rose $2.23, or 4.7 percent, to $50.13, after the company posted a 51 percent jump in its second-quarter profit as its deeply discounted goods attracted consumers.

Sharp declines in industrial and material stocks weighed on the market as commodities prices wavered. A long rally in commodities prices that started earlier this year has been sputtering in recent weeks.

Oil prices fell further Wednesday after the government reported an increase in crude supplies. The price of crude oil settled down 62 cents, to $71.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Government bond prices were little changed despite favorable demand at an auction of $39 billion in five-year notes.

Strong demand at recent auctions suggests investors have little near-term concern about inflation. Analysts, however, say it is a problem that could eventually create trouble for the bond market.

The price on benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 101 19/32. Its yield remained at 3.43 percent.

Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of five-year notes:

749 2009-08-28 The officials interviewed for this article spoke anonymously so that they could discuss debates over classified matters.

On the day the decision was announced, Mr. Panetta phoned Mr. Holder, according to people familiar with the call. In the conversation, which lasted less than a minute, the C.I.A. director told the attorney general that the agency would cooperate but expressed his displeasure and swore mildly, if only once.

Mr. Holder and Mr. Panetta are each confronting difficult balancing acts. Mr. Holder inherited a dispirited department accused of carrying out the political wishes of the Bush White House, and he now must show independence while continuing to work with the rest of the administration.

For his part, Mr. Panetta, who is also new to his job and lacks a background in intelligence, must carry out White House orders to make a clean break with some of the Bush administration’s intelligence policies, including ending the C.I.A.’s harsh interrogations. At the same time he must soothe frayed nerves at the C.I.A.

, the White House chief of staff, said that reports of shouting matches were overblown and that the protagonists were simply advocating for their agencies’ viewpoints in robust discussions, as they should. “Leon’s representing his institutional building,” Mr. Emanuel said. “Eric’s representing his institutional responsibilities.”

While top C.I.A. officials are angry at the Justice Department, Mr. Panetta has also quarreled over turf with , the director of national intelligence, to whom he reports. The White House has occasionally been frustrated with both Mr. Panetta and Mr. Holder. And some in the administration have taken aim at , the White House counsel, blaming him for some of the troubles in handling the detainee issue.

The behind-the-scenes fighting began in April when, in response to an A.C.L.U. lawsuit, the Justice Department prepared to release legal opinions written by its lawyers during the Bush administration authorizing the C.I.A. to use brutal interrogation techniques.

Mr. Obama disavowed the harsh methods, like and wall-slamming, but the legal opinions were filled with embarrassing details about the C.I.A.’s aggressive approach. Mr. Panetta sought to heavily edit the memos before releasing them but was overruled when Mr. Obama sided with Mr. Holder, who wanted more detailed disclosures, the officials said.

Though he lost on the memos, Mr. Panetta’s camp came away thinking that at least they had won a tacit understanding, said some administration officials; the embarrassing details would be aired, but Justice would back off from any new investigation.

In April, C.I.A. officers felt reassured by Mr. Emanuel’s comments on ABC News, in which he said that Mr. Obama “believes that people in good faith were operating with the guidance they were provided; they shouldn’t be prosecuted.” But White House and Justice officials said that there was no such bargain and that all Mr. Emanuel meant was that C.I.A. officers who followed interrogation guidelines were safe from prosecution.

For his part, Mr. Holder had arrived in office in January thinking he might open an inquiry, and his resolve hardened after reading graphic classified reports of detainee abuse, including several deaths of prisoners in C.I.A. custody in and .

Still, it came as a shock to the C.I.A. when reported in July that Mr. Holder was leaning toward an investigation. Given that the information was contained in an exclusive profile of Mr. Holder, the agency took it as a signal that an inquiry was coming. Mr. Panetta felt blindsided and had several conversations with White House officials about the long-term damage he believed such an inquiry could do to the C.I.A. He said the C.I.A. had already taken disciplinary action against the officers who had committed the most egregious acts.

At the time, Mr. Panetta felt besieged on several fronts. Mr. Blair, the intelligence director, was pushing to appoint the senior intelligence officials in each country overseas, a traditional prerogative of the C.I.A.

And other administration officials complained when the C.I.A. sent documents about the detention program to the Senate Intelligence Committee without giving the White House time to consider whether there were any executive privilege issues.

The interagency debate grew heated enough that Mr. Emanuel summoned Mr. Panetta, Mr. Blair and other officials to the White House to set down rules for what should be provided to Congress. Mr. Panetta complained that he was being chastised for excessive openness after being criticized for excessive secrecy when he pushed to withhold details from the interrogation memos.

The various issues raised by the Bush-era interrogation and detention policies have caused other tensions within the Obama team. Mr. Emanuel and others have concluded that the White House mishandled the planning for the closing of the detention center at , .

Some in the administration blamed Mr. Craig, the White House counsel, for not anticipating and managing the political reaction to the decisions on Guantánamo and other issues. After The suggested that Mr. Craig was on the way out, a White House official said Mr. Emanuel reassured Mr. Craig that it was nonsense, and Mr. Craig’s defenders said he had been handed a thankless task.

Throughout the summer, Mr. Holder indicated that he was still weighing whether to appoint a prosecutor. The C.I.A. dismissed that as empty posturing. To the agency, it was clear that Mr. Holder had already made up his mind and was planning to announce the investigation, as he did Monday even as the inspector general report was released.

Few cabinet officers are closer to Mr. Obama than Mr. Holder, and the issue has been awkward for the two. Aides said that they could not rule out that the two discussed the matter but said that there was never a formal White House meeting about it.

Sensitive to the problems other administrations have had regarding politicizing the Justice Department, Mr. Obama left the decision to Mr. Holder, aides said.
750 2009-08-28 He was frustrated at times that he could not achieve more, aides and analysts said. But he also believed that legislation could always be improved over the years, and he often went back to laws he had shaped, seeking changes to make them more to his liking.

“There are a lot of senators who are content to put their name on something, get it passed and move on to something else,” said Bruce Oppenheimer, professor of political science at . “But Kennedy understood that legislation is incremental and that conditions or context change. If you’re a good senator, you incubate legislation until it’s time for it to emerge.”

Health care is the most obvious case where Mr. Kennedy can claim enormous strides. He supported medical research and had a hand in building hundreds of community health centers, in providing access to health care for workers who lose their jobs, in protecting the privacy of medical records, and in providing services for those with and AIDS. He helped begin a program for pregnant women and new mothers that has grown from 88,000 recipients in the early 1970s to 8.7 million. He was a co-author of the , which now covers more than 7 million children and is expected to include 4 million more in coming years.

And yet his goal of universal coverage seems as distant as it was in 1969, when he first advocated it. He has expressed some regret that he did not work more closely then with allies to press the Nixon administration for a national program when President seemed open to the idea.

“I think he felt if he had it to do over again, he would have approached it differently,” said James Sterling Young, director of the Edward M. Kennedy oral history project at the , who conducted more than 90 hours of tape-recorded interviews with the senator.

Mr. Kennedy, with a long record of support for education, worked closely with President to enact , which aimed to improve school performance by enforcing national minimum standards for achievement. He was excoriated by some Democrats and teacher groups for making common cause with a Republican president on a measure they strongly opposed. Former President last year called the legislation a “train wreck” and placed a big share of the blame on Mr. Kennedy.

Mr. Kennedy himself acknowledged flaws in the law and complained that the bill had been badly underfinanced and that the program as designed by Bush administration officials encouraged teachers to design their classes solely around standardized tests. He also said the bill fell short of its goals of reducing class size and improving teacher training. Aides said that, had he lived, Mr. Kennedy would have worked to improve the law and see that it was fully financed.

A strong supporter of liberalization measures, Mr. Kennedy played a major role in bills in 1965, 1986 and 1990 that lifted quotas on some nationalities, provided legal status for some undocumented workers and opened the borders to thousands fleeing oppression.

But he failed in his most ambitious effort to remake the nation’s immigration system and provide legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the today. In 2006, he co-sponsored a measure with Senator , the Republican, that would have strengthened border security while establishing a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal migrants.

The bill died in the House and the debate polarized an already divided Congress and nation. The climate for illegal immigrants in the United States has worsened since then, with an increase in hate crimes, activity by anti-immigrant groups and ranting on cable television and the Internet, according to Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the liberal Center for American Progress.

But Ms. Kelley said she was hopeful that would take up Mr. Kennedy’s cause and begin to speak out forcefully for immigrants. While Mr. Kennedy believed that compromise and bipartisanship were critical to achieving broad policy goals, he was largely inflexible on Supreme Court nominees. He played a large role in changing the nature and tone of debate on Supreme Court nominees with his opposition to Mr. Bork’s nomination in 1987. He delivered a forceful attack on Mr. Bork on the Senate floor and led the fight to defeat his nomination.

Charles Fried, who was President ’s solicitor general at the time and is now a professor at Law School, said that Mr. Kennedy had been “vicious” to Mr. Bork and unfair to subsequent Republican nominees.

“He was very effective on judicial nomination, but he was not at his best,” Mr. Fried said. “This was not the most admirable aspect of his political personality.”
751 2009-08-28 Toll Brothers, the largest American builder of luxury homes, reported a wider loss for its third quarter as the recession weighed on sales. The company said Thursday that it had begun to raise prices as the market showed signs of recovery.

The net loss for the three months ended July 31 swelled to $472.3 million, or $2.93 a share, from $29.3 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. The loss, which included tax charges and write-downs of $554 million, was greater than analysts’ estimates.

A recovery may be getting under way in the housing market after a slump that started in 2006. Prices rose in 18 of 20 American cities in June, according to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index. The cancellation rate for Toll’s homes in the quarter fell to the lowest level since the beginning of the economic contraction.

“We are fairly well convinced that the bottom has been turned and therefore we are not increasing incentives or lowering prices anywhere,” Robert I. Toll, chief executive of the company, said in a conference call with investors and analysts. The company has raised prices in about 40 percent of its developments and the rest are seeing “price stability,” Mr. Toll said.

The builder was expected to report a loss of $1.28 a share, according to the average estimate of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue fell 42 percent, to $461.4 million, from $796.7 million in the period a year earlier.

Home builders like Toll Brothers have struggled to weather the biggest collapse of demand for new homes on record. Sales of new homes probably will fall to 353,000 this year, the lowest in data going back to 1963, according to a forecast on the National Association of Realtors Web site.
752 2009-08-28 Roger Federer was calm and cheerful before the United States Open draw Thursday afternoon, and he was still calm and cheerful afterward. The 10-minute unveiling of this year’s bracket clearly did not worry him, even if the path to his 16th major title could take him through Andy Roddick or Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, and Andy Murray or Rafael Nadal in the final.

Federer arrived in New York after a momentous summer in which he finally won the French Open, surpassed Pete Sampras’s record for most men’s major titles and became a father to twin girls. With his charge to victory in suburban Cincinnati last week, it seems that changing diapers has not hurt his form.

“It was an amazing summer,” said Federer, who will open the tournament against Devin Britton, an American wild card. “I’m still playing well. I played great in Cincinnati, and I hope to do well at the Open.”

For Federer’s chief rival, the third-seeded Nadal, the tournament could be tricky from the outset. Until this week, Federer and Nadal had been the top two seeds at every major tournament since the 2005 Open. But Murray, who lost in the final last year, earned this year’s No. 2 seed behind Federer at Nadal’s expense. Nadal will face Richard Gasquet, who returned to the ATP World Tour last month after failing a drug test earlier in the year. And it will not get easier for Nadal if he advances, with potential matchups against the Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Murray and Juan Martín del Potro.

For the top five men’s seeds, the draw seemed most generous to Djokovic and Roddick. They probably have little to worry about until the second week. Roddick, seeded fifth, will start his run against Bjorn Phau of Germany and hope to build on his run at Wimbledon, where he fell to Federer in the fifth set of an epic final.

“He has improved as a player again in the last year or two,” Federer said of Roddick on the ESPN News broadcast. “He’s moving better. His serve has always been great. For him, it was more about making the right play from the baseline, and it seems he’s doing all the right things. So I also see him going deep into the tournament again.”
753 2009-08-28 “Every time that Boeing has announced it’s confident it has a fix and it has a new schedule, they turn around and disappoint again,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm. “This is now the show-me program. Boeing has to get the airplane in the air.”

In June, Boeing again pushed back its test-flight schedule after tests found additional stress in small areas where the wings meet the plane’s body. On Thursday, Boeing executives said they were working to reinforce the planes with new fittings, and would repeat the tests that originally revealed the problem before they undertook a test flight.

“We have a high degree of confidence in the fix and the time it’ll take,” Mr. McNerney said.

This month, Boeing acknowledged it had ordered an Italian company to halt production on sections of the jet’s fuselage after discovering small wrinkles in their carbon composite covering.

The setbacks have come at a painful moment for airlines and aircraft manufacturers. Business and leisure travel is down and freight shipments have dwindled, probably pushing airline losses to $9 billion worldwide this year, according to the International Air Transport Association.

In June, the Australian airline Qantas announced it was canceling 15 orders for the Dreamliner and delaying 15 more orders for four years, a move that the airline said would save $3 billion.

On Thursday, Boeing also said it would take a charge of $2.5 billion, or $2.21 a share, because the company could not find commercial buyers for the first three test planes. It said it still hoped to find buyers for its fourth, fifth and sixth test airplanes.

Boeing said it would count the $2.5 billion write-off as a cost of research and development, and would have no effect on the company’s cash position. Some Wall Street analysts have estimated that Boeing has spent some $10 billion in research and development of the 787, which could bring in more than $100 billion in sales.

While some analysts were skeptical about whether Boeing could stick to its timetables as it runs the planes through a battery of tests, investors were heartened by the promise of a takeoff.

Shares of Boeing rose $4, or 8.4 percent, to $51.82.

Analysts said that Boeing could begin to restore any lost confidence and ease worries about costs of the program by meeting its latest deadlines.

“The adage that time is money is never better seen than here,” said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. “The delay has cost them orders. It has cost them a marketing advantage. But is it fatal to the program? Highly unlikely.”
754 2009-08-28 Microsoft is cutting the price of the high-end Xbox 360 console by $100, matching Sony’s price cut for the PlayStation 3 last week.

Now, both the Xbox 360 Elite and the PS3 will cost $299. The price cuts in both cases are worldwide, though the exact amounts vary by region depending on currencies.

Microsoft, which has had three versions of its Xbox 360 available at three different prices, also was expected to announce on Thursday that it would phase out the midrange Pro version of the console. It will be available for $249, down from $299, while supplies last.

The cheapest Xbox, the Arcade, which comes without a hard drive, will still cost $199.

The price cuts are effective Friday, a spokesman for Microsoft, David Dennis, said.

Video game companies hope the price cuts will reignite sales in time for the holiday season. For most of this year, the industry has suffered from weak sales — hurt by the recession and lackluster game release schedules, which have kept consumers waiting to spend money on new games.

The announcement from Microsoft leaves only Nintendo without a price cut for the fall. The Wii has cost $250 since it was released nearly three years ago.

I am not surprised that an underfinanced Environmental Protection Agency working within an outmoded chemical policy framework is incapable of protecting Americans from the dangers of atrazine in their water. In the United States, we have it backward, assuming that chemicals are innocent until proved guilty of harming human health and the environment.

Last year, California created the Green Chemistry Initiative, intended to phase out chemicals known to cause harm, to restrict the use of those for which data do not exist and to push businesses to use safer alternatives.

Right now, regulations are being written, and we hope they will enable the “worst of the worst” chemicals to be phased out quickly and efficiently. If states like California and Maine can create robust and comprehensive “green chemical” policy, we can circumvent the failed federal regulatory system.

The dismissals were a victory for gay rights activists in Fort Worth, who had campaigned for the officers to be held to account after the violent incident, on June 28 at the Rainbow Lounge. “People wanted to make sure that it wasn’t swept under the rug,” said Todd Camp, the director of a gay film festival who was at the club that night. “I hope this gives folk a little hope.” A separate investigation into the actions of six Fort Worth police officers during the raid has not yet concluded, a police spokesman said.

760 2009-08-29 The Missouri reserve quarterback Blaine Dalton has been kicked off the team after a campus arrest on suspicion of drunken driving, Coach Gary Pinkel said. The campus police said Dalton, a highly regarded freshman, was arrested at 1:16 a.m. Friday on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, failing to drive in a single lane and operating an unlicensed motor vehicle. He posted $500 bond and was released.

Dalton had been competing with Jimmy Costello for the No. 2 quarterback job behind Blaine Gabbert. The arrest was Dalton’s second in Columbia. After a traffic stop in April, he pleaded guilty in June to two traffic offenses and being a minor in possession of alcohol. ¶The Iowa senior running back Jayme Murphy will miss the 2009 season after having surgery for a back injury.

761 2009-08-29 “I’ve had a couple of weeks this year where I played well but didn’t hit it good, just putted good,” he said. “You start to see the more putts you make under 10 feet, you kind of creep up the leader board more so than you would if you just hit it really good.”

Simpson crept past plenty of people Friday, a difficult day for golf that had some of the pretournament favorites struggle in the heavy air and wet rough. Tiger Woods shot a one-over-par 72 and is tied for 17th at one over for the tournament. Woods, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, was neither hot nor cold in a round that frustrated him enough that he declined, for the second day in a row, to discuss the details of his play.

Woods has holed 107 feet of putts in two rounds, which puts him in a tie for No. 1 in that metric — with Simpson. But Woods missed at least three makeable birdie putts Friday, including one from five feet, for which there is no stat other than three fewer birdies on the scorecard and one fuming Tiger Woods.

The top four spots on the leader board belong to players who started their rounds in the afternoon, after most of the nearly two inches of blowing rain had already fallen on the course. Among the four, Slocum is the longest shot, ranked 124th. Just to get into the field of 100 players next week at the Deutsche Bank Championship, he will need to finish at least 53rd in this event.

Among the golfers whose FedEx Cup chances were washed away by the rain was Mark Calcavecchia, whose opening 69 put him in good position but whose second-round 79 put him outside the cut line of six-over-par 148. Also gone is the rookie Matt Bettencourt, who played his way into the Cup at 97th largely on the basis of a surge that began with a tie for fifth at the Memorial Tournament and a top-10 at the United States Open.

He opened with a 77, and his 71 in the second round put him one stroke over the line. Aaron Baddeley, who came in at 103rd, shot a 78 and missed by three strokes. Last year’s Cup winner, Vijay Singh, 59th coming in, also missed the cut, but he is in next week with room to spare.

And Simpson, who was 85th when he arrived in New York and had not threatened to win a tournament all year, will, if he wins this one, move all the way to second place in the FedEx Cup standings.

A golfer who majored in religion at Wake Forest, Simpson will draw on it as he ponders where he might finish Sunday.

“You know,” he said, “I’m a big believer in prayer, and so I’ll go to bed saying a few prayers tonight and come out tomorrow just like I did today.”

It is not a precise parallel, but the lady in New York Harbor has come to symbolize the hopes and dreams of so many people through the years, so why not a golfer? It seems fitting that a rendering of the Statue of Liberty’s image is the logo on the golf caps of her neighbor, Liberty National, whose 18th hole is a little more than 1,000 yards west.

Simpson is neither homeless nor the wretched refuse of a teeming shore, but he can see clearly the lamp that is lifted by the golden door, and he has turned the key halfway in the lock.
762 2009-08-29 Dmitry O. Rogozin, Russia’s ambassador to NATO, said Moscow anticipated news from Mr. Obama in September. “I hope that Medvedev will take some good result from this bilateral discussion in New York, and maybe in October we will live in a new world in Russian-American relations,” he said.

Administration spokesmen said it was premature to discuss what the review would conclude or when it would be finished. “Our review of our missile defense strategy is ongoing and has not reached completion yet,” said Philip J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman.

The proposed system inherited by Mr. Obama envisioned stationing 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a sophisticated radar facility in the Czech Republic to defend against potential ballistic missile threats from Iran or other hostile nations. But Russia has long objected to what it sees as a threat in its own backyard and has insisted that the Obama administration abandon the plan as a sign that it is serious about improving relations.

Shifting an anti-missile system out of territory once dominated by Moscow might mollify Russian concerns without jettisoning the missile shield altogether. At the same time, it could set off criticism both at home and in Eastern Europe that Mr. Obama was caving in to Russian pressure.

Polish fears that the United States was having second thoughts were heightened after diplomats learned of a meeting last week in Huntsville, Ala., that included generals who oversee missile defense, including Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, head of the United States Strategic Command.

“What was revealing about such a high-level gathering was that the speakers did not discuss how and when the missile shield would be deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic,” said Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a Washington-based lobbying group, who attended the meeting.

But administration officials rejected the assertion that a reformulated missile defense system would forsake Eastern European security. “We definitely are not abandoning our commitment to defend our European allies from a missile threat from Iran,” said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the review was not complete. “We are exploring options that will enhance the defense of our European allies.”

The cost of building the complexes in Poland and the Czech Republic could increase to more than $1 billion from $837 million, according to the Government Accountability Office, which published a report this month on preparations to deploy the system.

The cost estimates do not include support at the sites or the development, testing and procurement costs. The overall cost of establishing a modest ballistic missile system in Europe would exceed $4 billion through 2015, according to the G.A.O. report. Even at that, it said, “Congress does not have accurate information on the full investment required for ballistic missile defenses in Europe.”

The Bush administration strongly advocated a missile shield. Mr. Obama has been more skeptical, saying he will proceed only if it is financially and technically feasible. He has also told the Russians that the system would not be needed if they used their leverage to persuade Iran to drop its suspected nuclear weapons programs.

The discussions in Huntsville caused a stir among diplomats in Poland. Eastern European leaders worry that the Obama administration is playing down their security needs even though, they contend, Russia’s war with Georgia last year and increasing tension between Russia and Ukraine show the need for a strong American presence in the region.

“You can see that compared to the former Bush administration, the Obama administration is more interested in Russia, China and of course Afghanistan than Eastern Europe,” said Slawomir Debski, director of the Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw.

In Huntsville, General Cartwright made clear that the administration was focusing on the relevance, adaptability and affordability of any new programs, including missile defense, according to people who were at the meeting.

He also said that the United States had to take into account Russian sensitivities toward the missile shield for Eastern Europe.
763 2009-08-29 In recent weeks, spending has risen slightly because of exuberant car buying, fueled by the cash-for-clunkers program. On Friday, the Commerce Department said spending rose 0.2 percent in July from the previous month. But most economists see this activity as short-lived, pointing out that incomes did not rise. Some suggest the recession has endured so long and spread pain so broadly that it has seeped into the culture, downgrading expectations, clouding assumptions about the future and eroding the impulse to buy.

imbued American life with an enduring spirit of thrift. The current recession has perhaps proven wrenching enough to alter consumer tastes, putting value in vogue.

“It’s simply less fun pulling up to the stoplight in a Hummer than it used to be,” said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG. “It’s a change in norms.”

Here in Austin, a laid-back city on the of the Colorado River, change is palpable.

A decade ago, Heather Nelson gained a lucrative job in telecommunications and celebrated by buying a new sport utility vehicle with leather seats and an expensive stereo system. Today, Ms. Nelson, 38, again has designs on a new vehicle, but this time she plans to buy a , the hybrid.

In December, Ms. Nelson was laid off from her six-figure job as a patent attorney at a local software firm. Self-assured, she exudes confidence she will land another high-paying position.

But even if her spending power is restored, Ms. Nelson says her inclination to buy has been permanently diminished. Through nine months of joblessness, she has learned to forgo the impulse buys that used to provide momentary pleasure — $4 lattes at , lip gloss, mints. She has found she can survive without the pedicures and chocolate martinis that once filled regular evenings at the . Before punishing heat and drought turned much of central brown, she subsisted primarily on vegetables harvested from her plot at a community , where only one oasis of flowers remains.

Once intent on buying a home, Ms. Nelson now feels security in remaining a renter, steering clear of the shark-infested waters of the industry.

“I’m having to shift my dreams to accommodate the new realities,” she said. “Now, I have more of a bunker mentality. If you get hit hard enough, it lasts. This impact is going to last.”

For years, Americans have tapped stock portfolios and borrowed against homes to fill wardrobes with clothes, garages with cars and living rooms with furniture and electronics. But stock markets have proven volatile. Home values are sharply lower. Banks remain reluctant to lend in the aftermath of a global financial crisis.

Households must increasingly depend upon paychecks to finance spending, a reality that seems likely to curb consumption: Unemployment stands at 9.4 percent and is expected to climb higher. Working hours have been slashed even for those with jobs.

Economists subscribe to a so-called wealth effect: as households amass wealth, they tend to expand their spending over the following year, typically by 3 to 5 percent of the increase.

Between 2003 and 2007 — prime years of the housing boom — the net worth of an American household expanded to about $540,000, from about $400,000, according to an analysis of federal data by Moody’s .

Now, the wealth effect is working in reverse: by the first three months of this year, household net worth had dropped to $421,000.

“Not only have people lost money, but they don’t expect as much appreciation in the money they have, and that should affect consumption,” said Andrew Tilton, an economist at . “This is a cultural shift going on. People will save more.”

As recently as the middle of 2007, Americans saved less than 2 percent of their income, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In recent months, the rate has exceeded 4 percent.

Austin has fared better than most cities during the recession. Increased government payrolls enabled by the state’s energy wealth have largely compensated for layoffs in construction and technology. Local unemployment reached 7.1 percent in June — well below the national average. Housing prices have mostly held. Yet even people with high incomes appear reluctant to spend.

“The only time you do a lot of business is when you throw a sale,” said Pat Bennett, a salesman at a in north Austin. “You see very little impulse buying. They come in saying, ‘I need a pair of underwear,’ and they get it and leave. You don’t really see them saying, ‘Oh, I love the way that shirt looks, and I’m just going to get it.’ ”

Mr. Bennett attributes frugality to a general uneasiness about the future.

“Our parents had the Depression,” Mr. Bennett said. “This is like a mini-shock for the baby boomers after the go-go years.”

At a mall devoted to home furnishings, many storefronts were vacant, and survivors were draped in the banners of desperation: “Inventory Clearance,” “50% Off,” “It’s All On Sale.”

But at the Natural Gardener — a lush assemblage of demonstration plots that sells seeds, plants and tools for organic gardening — business has never been better.

Sales of vegetable plants swelled fivefold in March over past years. The company added a public address system and bleachers to accommodate hordes showing up for vegetable-growing classes.

Part of the embrace of gardening stems from concerns about the environment and , says the company’s president, John Dromgoole. Momentum also reflects desire to save on food costs.

“People are very interested in shoring up against losing their jobs,” he said.
764 2009-08-29 HONG KONG (AP) — Apple has reached a deal with a Chinese wireless carrier, China Unicom, to sell the iPhone in China, the world’s biggest cellphone market.

Under a multiyear deal announced Friday, the iPhone is expected to go on sale in the fourth quarter, China Unicom executives said in Hong Kong. They declined to give financial details or reveal how much the iPhone would cost, saying only that the price would be “competitive.”

Unicom, one of three major state-owned carriers, would be the first Chinese phone company to formally support the iPhone, though unlocked iPhones brought in from other markets are in wide use in China.

The mobile market in China trails the United States, Japan and some others in financial size but it has 650 million mobile phone accounts and is seen as a major prize for foreign companies. However, Edward Yu, chief executive at Analysys International, a technology research firm in Beijing, said it remained to be seen whether the iPhone would appeal to “the mainstream China population.”

The chief executive of Unicom, Chang Xiaobin, said the companies would not share revenue, with Unicom instead buying the phones in batches from Apple and offering them with subsidies.

Many Chinese already own iPhones bought on the country’s thriving gray market. There are well over 1.5 million of the devices in China, according to estimates by BDA China Ltd., a technology research firm in Beijing.

Analysts said that could work in favor of Apple and China Unicom by providing a ready pool of users who might be willing to upgrade to an authorized iPhone that offers a warranty, fewer glitches, more applications and faster speeds.
765 2009-08-29 The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, is proposing new rules for money market funds: stricter limits on the kinds of securities they can hold, for instance, and new liquidity requirements. There is even talk of a “liquidity facility” to help the industry though another crisis.

Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told me recently that he believed that money market funds should be regulated like bank deposits since, as he pointed out, “when push came to shove, they got government support.” He added, “If they are going to maintain banklike characteristics, they ought to be insured” — and regulated.

What very few people are talking about, however, is a more radical solution to the moral hazard question raised by money market funds. Maybe the right approach now is to acknowledge the truth. Money market funds are not, in fact, turbocharged bank accounts. They are investment vehicles. However “safe” the securities they invest in, they contain an element of risk. Indeed, the very reason they yield more than savings accounts is that they are riskier. That’s how investing works.

So maybe, in this post-Reserve Fund world, it’s time for the industry — and investors — to stop pretending that money funds are risk-free. As it turns out, there is a pretty simple way to do this. As it also turns out, the money market fund industry is dead-set against it.

The key to the long-held perception that money market funds are akin to savings accounts is that stable $1 “net asset value,” or N.A.V. But it wasn’t always that way. When money market funds were first created in the early 1970s, they had a “floating” N.A.V., just like any other kind of mutual fund.

On the day a fund opened, it would be set at $10 a share. Investors would get the numbers of shares that equaled their investment. The fund manager tried to maintain that price, but it would often fluctuate between, say, $9.97 and $10.03. “Most days, though, it stayed at $10,” recalled Matthew P. Fink, the former president of the Investment Company Institute, and the author of “The Rise of Mutual Funds.” But even when it didn’t, the world didn’t come to an end.

By the time money funds became truly popular, however, they did have that fixed $1 share price. This was during the early 1980s, when interest rates had skyrocketed and money funds — unlike regulated savings accounts — offered market rates of interest. In the late 1970s, the industry had persuaded the S.E.C. to allow it to move to a stable N.A.V., which it pushed for precisely because it wanted money funds to resemble a bank account, with which they were competing. (Money funds even came with checks attached.) To accomplish this, a series of new regulations were required, one of which exempted money funds from mark-to-market accounting, while others imposed limits on the kinds of short-term securities they could hold.

I’ve always believed that the invention of money market funds was the secret key to the rise of the mutual fund industry. People flocked to them in the early 1980s because they were the only tool available to prevent middle-class savings from being eroded by inflation. Then, when the bull market began in 1982, Americans gradually moved that money into mutual funds.

But money market funds didn’t fade away, even after bank savings accounts were deregulated. Throughout their history, they offered higher yields than people could get at the bank, and even though they lacked government insurance, people used them the same way they used a bank account: as a place to park cash. The industry became so committed to the idea that money funds should serve as alternatives to bank accounts that on the rare occasions when a money fund threatened to break the buck — that is, lose a penny or two — the company that owned the fund invariably put up the cash to prevent any losses.

When the Reserve Fund broke the buck last year, it was only the second time that had ever happened. (The first time involved a much smaller fund, and had much less impact.) The industry, having built the business on the foundation of the $1 share price, reacted in horror.

But when you think about it, the Reserve Fund didn’t really “collapse.” Rather, one of its securities defaulted and it lost a few pennies for its investors. It happens. The problem is that the fund industry has spent so many years training people to believe this could never happen, that they inevitably panicked when it did. And that panic, in turn, is what caused the government to rush to the rescue with its guarantees.

So yes, one way to try to solve the problem now is to make money funds “safer” than ever, largely through regulation. That is the route the S.E.C. is taking, and that the industry is encouraging. That route will continue to allow investors to believe that money funds are, essentially, higher-yielding bank accounts. It will also ensure that the moral hazard issue will never go away.

Here’s the other way we could go: we could return to the floating N.A.V. There would still be rules about what kinds of securities a money market fund could hold, but it would also be a market-driven acknowledgment that money market funds were riskier than bank accounts. The proof would be the fact that the N.A.V. would occasionally fluctuate.

People who wanted absolute safety would move their money to the bank. But as the rest of us became psychologically accustomed to those fluctuations, panic would not ensue on the rare occasions when a money fund lost a penny or two. Moral hazard would be diminished.

Perhaps the most vocal proponent of this approach is Joel H. Goldberg, a former director of the S.E.C.’s division of investment management. He pointed out that one of the consequences of the new rules the S.E.C. was proposing — rules intended to protect the $1 fixed price — was that they would inevitably diminish money fund yields, making them a less attractive alternative to bank accounts. By moving to a floating N.A.V., money funds would still be largely safe. But with somewhat fewer restrictions, they could still reap higher yields. The floating N.A.V. would be a way of saying, “With these rewards come some risks,” however small.

As it happens, another person who has broached this idea is Andrew J. Donohue, known as Buddy, who has Mr. Goldberg’s old job at the S.E.C. In several speeches last year, he suggested the possibility of moving to a floating N.A.V. In its recent proposals, the agency also asked for comments on the idea.

Those comments have been uniformly negative. “Over its history, a third of a quadrillion dollars — $330 trillion — has moved through money market funds with no losses,” said Paul S. Stevens, the president of the Investment Company Institute. Consumers, he said, want the stable price, and depend on it. “They don’t just value the extra yield,” he said. “They value the convenience. And they value the safety.”

What the industry really fears, of course, is that if the illusion of complete safety is shattered — an illusion it has spent so much effort in creating — the money fund industry will evaporate, as people race back to the bank. But Mr. Goldberg says he believes that most people will adjust quickly to the idea that their money fund fluctuates in price a wee bit.

I think they would too. More important, a year after Lehman weekend, it’s time to begin limiting the need for the government to always ride to the rescue. It’s time to reduce moral hazard wherever possible.
766 2009-08-29 More investigation could have made a difference, Mr. Kroll asserts. For example, “Fitch did not know that 15 percent of the people that were the bases of the mortgages never even made their mortgage payments,” he noted. “We are going to do our own research.”

Mr. Kroll’s own record has been challenged in the last year after it was disclosed that the Kroll security company for many years staunchly defended the Stanford Financial Group, which authorities now say is at the center of a multibillion-dollar fraud.

Mr. Kroll, 68, founded his security company in 1972 after working as a lawyer and trying his hand as a corporate detective. His client list came to include the United States government, which hired him to find hidden assets of the Marcos regime in the Philippines. Five years ago, he sold the firm to Marsh & McLennan for $1.9 billion and pocketed about $100 million. He remained chairman until last year, and his agreement not to compete with the company expired last month.

A well-known workaholic and entrepreneur in spirit, Mr. Kroll is planning the credit ratings company and a separate venture called K2 Global Partners, which will perform intelligence work for corporations and other clients. He is also working on a book about his career.

When asked about the Stanford problems, Mr. Kroll said that his former company averaged 15,000 investigations a year. “To me, the issue over a 37-year period is what do you think of the integrity of the firm,” he said.

Mr. Kroll’s company did work for Stanford for more than a decade, according to an article in the July issue of Vanity Fair. Earlier this year, R. Allen Stanford was charged with bilking investors out of $7 billion. He is awaiting trial. Stanford’s chief financial officer, James M. Davis, pleaded guilty this week and provided more details of the reported fraud, including a blood pact with a regulator, in his agreement with prosecutors.

Two Stanford investors, the National Electrical Contractors Association, a trade group, and its foundation, Electri International, have sued Kroll Inc., asserting that the firm had a conflict of interest. The two groups hired Kroll to perform due diligence on Stanford. They say they were not told that Kroll was also representing the company.

The lawsuits also say that the research prepared by Kroll on Stanford was inadequate. A spokeswoman for Kroll declined to comment on the lawsuits.

More problematic for Mr. Kroll than his Stanford connection may be the entrenched nature of the major credit agencies.

“I think it would take a consciousness shift among everyone” for business to move elsewhere, said Jerome Fons, former managing director of credit policy at Moody’s, “and it has to start with our government.”

“Right now,” he said, “the officially recognized agencies are very deeply embedded in financial regulation, investment contracts and rules.”

Mr. Kroll said he planned to start by having investors pay a subscription fee for data and analysis. That business, he acknowledged, has far lower margins than working with issuers who want a rating on their securities.

Sylvain Raines, a former Moody’s analyst and co-founder of R&R Consulting, which helps investors gauge debt risk, conceded that there was a vacuum that many might try to fill. But he dismissed Mr. Kroll’s plans, saying that structured finance and capital markets required very deep knowledge.
767 2009-08-29 The Intel Corporation raised its third-quarter revenue forecast above Wall Street’s expectations on Friday, citing strong demand for its chips and giving another signal that business is improving for one of the world’s biggest technology companies.

The company, the leading maker of computer microprocessors, said it expected sales of $8.8 billion to $9.2 billion, up from $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion it forecast on July 14.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $8.55 billion in revenue before Friday.

Intel also said it expected the quarter’s gross profit margin to be in the upper half of the range it previously forecast.

Intel signaled in July that its business was on the mend after a difficult downturn and the personal computer industry’s worst stretch since 2001. The company’s second-quarter sales were well above Wall Street’s expectations, and its guidance for the current quarter was better than analysts were predicting at the time.

“Intel was clearly being more conservative than they needed to be,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at Broadpoint AmTech, of the company’s earlier outlook.
768 2009-08-29 Shares were mixed on Friday after a weak consumer sentiment report offset positive news from bellwether technology companies like Dell and Intel.

Support from the companies, however, let the Nasdaq composite index eke out a tiny gain.

All three major indexes still posted their second weekly advance, although the gains were relatively modest.

With shares on Wall Street up about 50 percent from multiyear lows in March, investors are concerned that the rally may have run its course, and that with many market players taking last-minute vacations, there are not enough buyers to push stocks up further.

Consumer sentiment in August slid to a four-month low on worries about high unemployment and personal finances, a Reuters and University of Michigan survey showed, also curbing the market’s appetite for risk.

“Expectations are higher and any kind of data that doesn’t exceed forecasts with rosy numbers can’t move the market,” said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.

Wakefield to Miss Another Start for Boston

The knuckleballer Tim Wakefield’s balky back is acting up again, forcing the Boston Red Sox to scratch him from his next scheduled start, Tuesday at Tampa Bay. Wakefield, who spent five and a half weeks on the disabled list because of back problems after the All-Star break, pitched seven innings Wednesday, allowing one run and six hits in a win over the Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox said Jon Lester, originally scheduled to start Sunday, would instead pitch Tuesday at Tampa Bay.

The Minnesota Twins signed the left-hander Ron Mahay, who could provide more help for their struggling bullpen. Mahay had a 4.79 E.R.A. in 41 games for Kansas City, which released him last week. In the past month, the Twins have acquired the right-handed reliever Jon Rauch, starter Carl Pavano and shortstop Orlando Cabrera.

Los Angeles Dodgers starter Hiroki Kuroda, who was hit on the head by a line drive two weeks ago, threw 35 pitches in a simulated game without any trouble and could begin a minor league rehabilitation assignment this week. Kuroda is 5-5 with a 4.08 E.R.A. in 15 starts.
775 2009-08-30 “The crazy thing is that we left offense out there,” Keenum said. “We left games out there. We left a lot of yards out there and touchdown passes.”

While Houston was second in the Football Bowl Subdivision in passing yards and total offense per game last season, the second-year coach Kevin Sumlin and Keenum said that they believed that the Cougars’ offense could be even better this season.

That is why Sumlin, who keeps Ware’s Heisman Trophy in his office, is promoting Keenum as a dark horse for the award and does not shy from talk about him potentially throwing for 6,000 yards.

“There’s a lot of things that people thought they’d never see,” Sumlin said. “I wouldn’t rule it out.”

With little fanfare last season, Keenum had an F.B.S. sophomore record of 5,241 total offensive yards, which was more than Bradford, who won the Heisman. He also had more passing yards and touchdown passes (44) than McCoy, the Heisman runner-up. He topped Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, the 2007 Heisman winner, in passing yards, touchdown passes and completion percentage.

Although Keenum’s numbers came in Conference USA, they are pretty good for an undersized quarterback listed at 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds, who accepted the only scholarship he was offered coming out of high school.

“In a room full of quarterbacks, you wouldn’t pick him first,” Klingler said in a telephone interview. “He doesn’t stand out because of his size or because of his arm strength or quickness or athletic ability, but he’s as poised a kid as I’ve ever seen.”

Keenum learned to throw because of his father, Steve Keenum, a former coach. When he was the coach at McMurry University in Abilene, Tex., a 7-year-old Case begged him to be a ball boy.

But the elder Keenum would not let Case do it until he could throw a football from the sideline to the officials at the hash marks.

“It didn’t take him long,” Steve Keenum said in a telephone interview. “He was pretty determined on stuff like that. He got to where he could throw spirals.”

In high school, Keenum led Wylie High School to a Class 3A state championship his junior season.

A three-year starter at quarterback, Keenum also lettered in baseball, basketball, golf and track. He was all-state in basketball as a senior, a year in which he was second team in football.

Still, Keenum was overshadowed by many other high school quarterbacks in Texas, including Matthew Stafford, the top pick in April’s N.F.L. draft; Mississippi’s Jevan Snead; and Texas Tech’s Taylor Potts.

McCoy, who played high school football 19 miles south of Abilene, said he was impressed by him. The two often attended the same football camps in high school.

“I’ve always known that he was really good,” McCoy said in a telephone interview.

But that did not translate to many scholarship offers for Keenum. Art Briles, who was then Houston’s coach, gave Keenum his lone scholarship offer before his senior year. Keenum accepted on the condition that Briles would remain at Houston.

“He fit what I was looking for in a quarterback prototype,” Briles said in a telephone interview. “I want a guy that’s smart, has confidence, who’s poised and that can make quick decisions.”

After redshirting in 2006, Keenum started seven games the next season and was named Conference USA’s freshman of the year after throwing for 2,259 yards and 14 touchdowns. When Briles left for Baylor after that season, Keenum briefly considered following him.

The hiring of Sumlin, a former co-offensive coordinator at Oklahoma, eased the transition, especially when Sumlin brought in Dana Holgorsen, who had spent the previous eight seasons coaching the high-scoring offense at Texas Tech.

“It was the best of both worlds with the combination of O.U. and Tech,” Keenum said. “Those are the best two offenses in the nation.”

With last year’s success and an experienced offense that returns nearly all its skill players, the 6,000-yard plateau may be within reach for Keenum. The N.C.A.A. single-season record for passing yards is 5,833, set by the former Texas Tech quarterback B. J. Symons in 13 games in 2003.

If Houston reaches the Conference USA title game and goes to a bowl game this season, it would play 14 games. In that case, Keenum would need to average 428.58 passing yards a game to reach 6,000.

“It’s very, very doable,” said Klingler, who threw for 5,140 yards and 54 touchdowns in 11 games in 1990.

And although Keenum’s first priority is winning more games, he also says that 6,000 yards is feasible And he does not stop there.

“I don’t know if you can put a number on what our offense is capable of,” Keenum said.

That sounds eerily similar to the attitude during a bygone era in Houston.
776 2009-08-30 Although Harvard was voted No. 1 in the Ivy League’s preseason news media poll for the third time in four years, the Crimson’s title defense will not be simple. Like most of the league, Harvard entered camp without a clear idea of who would start at quarterback.

But Penn, voted No. 2, knows that its quarterback will be Keiffer Garton and will surround him with an experienced core of players. The Quakers’ trip to Cambridge, Mass., for the penultimate game of the season could go a long way to determining this year’s Ivy champion.

Brown should also be near the top of the standings after winning a share of the league title last year — the Bears’ third in a decade. They, too, are looking for an answer under center, but two talented senior receivers, Buddy Farnham and Bobby Sewall, will make the job easier for whoever wins the quarterback job.

Beyond those three, the rest of the league is remarkably even. Columbia, picked to finish sixth, could create a few surprises with its running quarterback M.A. Olawale, and Yale is virtually unknown ahead of its first season under Coach Tom Williams. Princeton and Cornell are trying to bounce back from mediocre campaigns while searching, sometimes among their underclassmen, for quarterbacks.

With so much uncertainty, many coaches are tempering their expectations for the season. But at Dartmouth, it will take very little to view this year as a step forward. The Big Green was 0-10 in 2008.
777 2009-08-30 Imagine being among the world’s top 10 or 12 tennis players, yet the odds strongly dictate you will not win or reach the finals and only half the final four is available and that, as McEnroe, now an ESPN analyst, said, depends on not running into Federer or Nadal earlier in the draw.

“The other players are realistic,” said James Martin, the editor of Tennis.com and Tennis magazine. “If Federer is motivated, then he’s going to keep winning.”

The ESPN analyst Cliff Drysdale said such dominance got into the heads of some players. But leading challengers like Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick and perhaps Juan Martín del Potro “don’t look at Federer and Nadal as an automatic,” Drysdale said.

Connors, now a Tennis Channel analyst, added: “If guys are giving the two spots away, they should go find another job. You say, ‘I’m here to win, and it’s the only reason I’m here.’ ”

In fact, McEnroe predicted that Murray (who loves hardcourts) or Roddick (so brilliant at Wimbledon in nearly toppling Federer) would win the Open, and that Federer was sated by his recent titles and the birth of twin daughters.

That is not a common perception, but Martin agreed that the Open was the “most open of the Slams” — despite Federer’s five straight wins — because the fast surface works against Nadal’s game. Last year was Nadal’s first semifinal appearance in the Open, and he is still recovering from his injuries. Though Nadal reached the semifinals in his most recent tournament, Martin was struck by his tentativeness and downbeat comments.

“He always played every point like it’s a war and players think, I’m not going to beat this guy,” Martin said. “But if he’s thinking about his knees, that’ll give them more confidence.”

Patrick McEnroe, who will be an ESPN announcer alongside his brother John, said that Nadal’s knees would be “the $64,000 question.”

Patrick McEnroe added, “We won’t know until after the first few rounds if we can pencil him in.”

With or without Nadal involved, Murray, Djokovic, Roddick and del Potro are consensus contestants for the non-Federer spots, and the dark horse Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and the former contender Nikolay Davydenko seem squeezed out. But John McEnroe said Djokovic “is not where he was” when he reached six semifinals in 2007 and 2008 and even grabbed the Australian title in 2008.

Although Martin said del Potro “wants it bad,” Patrick McEnroe said del Potro looked weary in his most recent best-of-three matches and that the best-of-five format of the Grand Slam events “put fitness at a premium.”

That leaves Roddick and Murray, perhaps unsurprisingly, as the leading lights.

Roddick is fitter than ever, and his big serve booms on Flushing’s hardcourts. But Martin and Drysdale said Roddick might be this generation’s Guillermo Vilas or Vitas Gerulaitis — elite players whose bid for superstardom fell short because they were contemporaries of Connors, Borg and John McEnroe. If Roddick had been a tweener like Lleyton Hewitt, who was ranked No. 1 between Pete Sampras and Federer, he might have fared better, Drysdale said, adding that Murray “is by far the next best.”

Drysdale added, “Two years from now we’ll be talking about him being in almost every semifinal.”

Martina Navratilova, now a Tennis Channel analyst, agreed, saying: “He’s got the game. It’s just a matter of when. Two years from now, it might be Nadal-Murray or Federer-Murray all the time.”

When asked if Murray could reach that level, Connors said: “Murray has got to win first. McEnroe stepped up and won. The word great is used too loosely sometimes.”

The Federer-Nadal rivalry has drawn in casual fans, Martin said.

Drysdale added, “It’s better to have stars.”

But, as Connors said, “the fans want to see some of these other guys step up and throw their weight around, too.”
778 2009-08-30 At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test on April 23 — a test never announced by the Pakistanis — that appeared to give the country a new offensive weapon.

American military and intelligence officials say they suspect that Pakistan has modified the Harpoon antiship missiles that the United States sold the country in the 1980s, a move that would be a violation of the Arms Control Export Act. Pakistan has denied the charge, saying it developed the missile itself. The United States has also accused Pakistan of modifying American-made P-3C aircraft for land-attack missions, another violation of United States law that the Obama administration has protested.

Whatever their origin, the missiles would be a significant new entry into Pakistan’s arsenal against India. They would enable Pakistan’s small navy to strike targets on land, complementing the sizable land-based missile arsenal that Pakistan has developed. That, in turn, would be likely to spur another round of an arms race with India that the United States has been trying, unsuccessfully, to halt. “The focus of our concern is that this is a potential unauthorized modification of a maritime antiship defensive capability to an offensive land-attack missile,” said another senior administration official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter involves classified information.

“The potential for proliferation and end-use violations are things we watch very closely,” the official added. “When we have concerns, we act aggressively.”

A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because the interchanges with Washington have been both delicate and highly classified, said the American accusation was “incorrect.” The official said that the missile tested was developed by Pakistan, just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of land-based missiles that could strike India. He said that Pakistan had taken the unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect the country’s Harpoon inventory to prove that it had not violated the law, a step that administration officials praised.

Some experts are also skeptical of the American claims. Robert Hewson, editor of Jane’s Air-Launched Weapons, a yearbook and Web-based data service, said the Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land-attack missile, which would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new missile. Moreover, he said, Pakistan already has more modern land-attack missiles that it developed itself or acquired from .

“They’re beyond the need to reverse-engineer old U.S. kit,” Mr. Hewson said in a telephone interview. “They’re more sophisticated than that.” Mr. Hewson said the ship-to-shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted effort to develop an array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air, land or sea to address India’s much more formidable conventional missile arsenal.

The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the United States and a Pakistani military that American officials like to portray as an increasingly reliable partner in the effort to root out the forces of the Taliban and on Pakistani territory. A central element of the American effort has been to get the military refocused on the internal threat facing the country, rather than on threat the country believes it still faces from India.

Pakistani officials have insisted that they are making that shift. But the evidence continues to point to heavy in both nuclear and conventional weapons that experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents.

Over the years, the United States has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to Pakistan, including 37 of the older-model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to 1988, said Charles Taylor, a spokesman for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.

The country’s nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nation’s. In May, Pakistan conducted a test firing of its Babur medium-range missile, a weapon that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear warhead. The test was conducted on May 6, during a visit to Washington by President , but was not made public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had ended to avoid upsetting the talks. While it may be technically possible to arm the Harpoons with small nuclear weapons, outside experts say it would probably not be necessary.

Before lawmakers departed for their summer recess, administration officials briefed Congress on the protest to Pakistan. The dispute has the potential to delay or possibly even derail the legislation to provide Pakistan with $7.5 billion in civilian aid over five years; lawmakers are expected to vote on the aid package when they return from their recess next month.

The legislation is sponsored by Senators of and of , the top Democrat and Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, as well as Representative , a Democrat who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressional aides are now reconciling House and Senate versions of the legislation.

Frederick Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, declined to comment on the details of the dispute citing its classified nature but suggested that the pending multifaceted aid bill would clear Congress “in a few weeks” and would help cooperation between the two countries.

“There have been irritants in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the past and there will be in the future,” Mr. Jones said in a statement, noting that the pending legislation would provide “with new tools to address troubling behavior.”
779 2009-08-30 Mr. Kandefer’s collection of the unusual includes Asian lemon grass; Roman mint, which looks like oregano and has a hint of lemon; bay trees for fresh versions of the leaves that most people have only had dried; brown Indian cucumbers called poona kheera and Sikkim; and, among his many peppers, a super-hot variety with black seeds called manzano and a white and green variegated one, the size of a jalapeño, called a fish hot, which some say is the secret ingredient in Old Bay seasoning.

But his pièce de résistance is figs. Mr. Kandefer has about 15 fig trees in two varieties — Italian honey and Turkish brown. “An old Italian guy gave me two trees,” he said. “He said he was too old to take care of them anymore, do I want them? I said, ‘Sure.’ Didn’t know the slightest thing about figs.”

He learned. After being dragged in and out of the greenhouse for a few years, the trees rooted indoors one winter, and that’s where they’ve stayed. Grapefruit is something of a novelty, but the figs are serious business.

“People go crazy,” Mr. Kandefer said. “Most weeks I don’t have enough to go around, between the restaurants and the pre-orders.”

For many producers of unusual foods, there is a similar mix of serious business and novelty. At Creamery Brook Bison in Brooklyn, bison (buffalo) meat is the only business. At Holbrook Farm in Bethel, John Holbrook counts the unusual Brazilian crops he grows as an important part of his income. At The Bridge in Middletown, tofu made from organic soybeans grown in upstate New York, seitan and amasake are the only products and have kept the company in business for more than 30 years. At Kandew Acres in Roxbury, the specialties are pheasant, partridge and duck.

Allyn Brown, the owner of Maple Lane Farms in Preston, produces black currant juice from the fruit that he grows on 120 acres, believed to be the largest black currant operation in North America. Mr. Brown hopes to capitalize on their high anti-oxidant content.

“It’s the challenge,” he said. “It’s just a little more interesting than growing your basic tomato every day. It’s also a year-round business for us rather than just a seasonal business.”

At Lyman Orchards in Middlefield, John Lyman was just looking for something a little different when he settled on jostaberries — a tart, cranberry-like cross between black currants and gooseberries. Most of his two-acre crop goes into preserves.

“It’s got some real curiosity to it,” he said. “I’m finding some people who have gotten to know it and are pretty loyal customers.” Mr. Lyman also grows several varieties of Asian pears, uncommon in the state, though Connecticut is the largest pear producer in New England.

Many foods that seem exotic for New England are turning up in small amounts at more and more farms: kohlrabi, hakurei turnips, okra, edamame, Jerusalem artichokes, ground cherries and quince. Grass-fed beef (some from Scottish highland cattle), Tamworth pigs, rabbits and all manner of heritage poultry, including ducks and roosters, are reasonably easy to find.

At WalkingWood in Woodbridge, Elizabeth Wikfors raises rabbits and has 30 heritage chicken varieties that produce a rainbow of eggs. Most unusual: the eggs produced by her two emus, each equivalent to 10 very dense chicken eggs, so they take a bit of getting used to, she said.

The same goes for Julia Cronin’s duck and goose eggs at Cedar Meadow Farm in Ledyard. Ms. Cronin said that her goose eggs were “an omelet in the shell” and that the duck eggs “cannot be beat for baking.

“The protein levels,” she continued, “are a little higher, which gives you a lighter, fluffier baked product.”

She has heard from customers with egg allergies who can eat duck eggs. “Every time I hear a little story like that,” she said, “I go ‘O.K., cool, that’s why I’m doing it, even though it doesn’t pay the bills.’ ”

Gregg Wershoven’s financial hopes for his bright blue, pink and yellow oyster mushrooms are a little higher. “I had an inclination from some reading that there’s a market for gourmet mushrooms,” he said.

His Mountain Top Mushrooms, which he began growing and selling a few months ago, fetch $12 a pound wholesale and $20 a pound retail. Mr. Wershoven said his colorful mushrooms may look cartoonish, but they are part of a serious business, with 12,500 square feet of growing space in the basement of an old mill in Waterbury.

At White Gate Farm in East Lyme, Pauline Lord is constantly balancing fun and profit. She enjoys growing out-of-the-ordinary vegetables and herbs. But greens like Claytonia and mâche also are cold-hardy and will keep business going into the off season, as will her new mini-broccoli varieties.

The up side, she said, is that “it’s interesting for the farmer, it’s interesting for your palate, customers like trying new things, chefs like trying new things. The downside: you can find things that just don’t make it for one reason or another.”

780 2009-08-30 Set up like clinicians in a financial-disaster triage tent, 10 lawyers assessed the bleeding and dispensed one-on-one advice about loan modifications, short sales and refinancing.

They referred some participants to one of five counselors from the county’s Office of Housing and Homeless Services or Nassau/Suffolk Law Services, which works with lower-income homeowners, as well as the district attorney’s office or the attorney general in cases where predatory lending was suspected.

“Business is brisk,” said Martha Krisel, chief deputy county attorney for special projects and chairwoman of the bar’s Mortgage Foreclosure Task Force, which has already held six clinics this year. “We are turning people away.”

The next clinic, by reservation only, is scheduled for Sept. 14 at the Bar Association.

Last month, Nassau County ranked first in foreclosure-related filings in the state.

Default notices — notices scheduling a public auction or a trustee’s sale — were received by 790 households. That number represented a jump of about 65 percent from July 2008, according to RealtyTrac, an online marketplace, which keeps a tally of foreclosed properties. A year ago, Nassau was ranked 10th in the state, Suffolk fifth.

Yvette Pacheco, deputy director of the county housing department, said her office was receiving 50 phone calls a day. Loans in distress are no longer limited to people in lower income brackets waylaid by subprime loans.

“We are seeing more people with higher incomes,” Ms. Pacheco said.

Mr. Randazzo is clearly in that category. The downward spiral is “very humbling,” he acknowledged. “I blew through my savings, I blew through my IRAs, I blew through my kids’ college funds, to try to keep this house going.”

His Porsche was repossessed — he now drives a 1991 “clunker” — and he sold his wife’s Range Rover. Still, he couldn’t downsize fast enough. Earlier this month, Mr. Randazzo, 47, learned that his house, on which he hasn’t been able to pay his $10,000 monthly mortgage for almost a year, is in foreclosure.

Another participant in the clinic, Patricia Ryan, 52, is a retired police officer from North Bellmore. She found herself with big bills from a divorce lawyer and stopped paying the mortgage on the $420,000 expanded Cape she shares with her children, 10 and 11, and her mother, 87. In May, when Ms. Ryan fell three months behind, the bank demanded the outstanding balance in a lump sum.

At the same time, her soon-to-be-ex-husband stopped paying the utility bills.

Ms. Ryan, who is on disability, said that she didn’t qualify for a loan modification or for a refinancing. “I can’t file with my husband — I am trying to get away from him — and I can’t file individually because I don’t have income by myself,” she said.

At the clinic, Kenneth S. Pelsinger, an East Meadow-based lawyer, advised Ms. Ryan to have her husband sign the house over to her and do a short sale — defined as selling for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.

Ms. Pacheco said counselors had helped more than 500 homeowners pinpoint hardships and scour budgets, made referrals to credit counselors and negotiated with lenders.

Counselors are also trying to keep homelessness at bay. “Some people are at risk of being displaced,” Ms. Pacheco said. “We are starting to see that a lot.”

Albert and Cynthia Landau have lived for 45 years in a four-bedroom Spanish colonial in Long Beach that once belonged to Mr. Landau’s parents and grandparents.

“We are, thank God, not in foreclosure,” said Ms. Landau, 69. But the two are searching for “some guidance on which way to go to avoid disaster.”

Their home, listed at $499,000, has been on the market for two years, nary a buyer in sight.

Ten years ago the Landaus — he is now 79 — took out a mortgage and home-equity loan for home improvements. By last winter, with the economy in a nose dive, they cut back on heating oil, resorted to using the fireplace for heat, bundled up in sweatsuits and shaved food bills to meet their $2,000 monthly expenses. Retired, both are looking for work. Counselors advised them to look into refinancing and to consult an estate-planning lawyer.

“We may be crawling along the bottom of the ocean,” Mrs. Landau said. “But we are not at the end of the road.”

As for Mr. Randazzo, his house is on the market for $1.749 million, but he is considering a short sale, for about $1.55 million. Seidia Roach Bernard, a counselor who works as a lawyer in Lynbrook, encouraged him to sell. “It will take you out of the hole,” she said.
781 2009-08-30 EVEN as a boy the filmmaker and animator Mike Judge had a hard time suspending disbelief when it came to the economic lives of fictional characters. “I remember just being annoyed when it seemed that everyone had endless cash and never had to work, while I always had lots of jobs,” he recalled in a telephone interview. His sister’s Nancy Drew books, in which the teenage heroine was forever jetting off to far-flung locations, were a particular source of irritation. “I’d say, ‘Where did she get the money for the plane ticket?’ ”

When Mr. Judge, 46, became a professional storyteller, this pet peeve developed from a literal-minded fixation into a sociological curiosity about the ways in which work runs our lives and shapes our identities.

“There are a lot of movies that show what people do for a living, but they’re detectives or assassins or high-end drug lords,” he said. “Maybe people are afraid the other stuff is boring. But I feel it’s always interesting to find out about a character through their job.”

Mr. Judge’s animated series “King of the Hill,” set to conclude its 13-season run on Fox next month, frequently delves into the work environments of its characters (including the no-nonsense hero, Hank Hill, a Texas propane salesman, and his wife, Peggy, a substitute Spanish teacher). And so did “Beavis and Butt-head,” the MTV cartoon that put Mr. Judge on the map, in which the two cretinous teenage antiheroes are unaccountably employed by the fast-food chain Burger World.

The daily grind was the subject  and the de facto villain  of Mr. Judge’s first live-action film, “Office Space” (1999), a workplace comedy that riffs on what Marx called the alienation of labor. Its cubicle-drone protagonist (Ron Livingston) is a latter-day Bartleby the Scrivener who redefines the slacker as revolutionary; confronted with the dehumanizing tedium of his software job, he decides to live out his “dream of doing nothing.”

With “Extract,” his latest live-action feature, opening on Friday, Mr. Judge returns to the dynamics of the workplace, but this time the boss is the object of sympathy. Played by Jason Bateman (in quintessential everyguy mode), Joel Reynold is the beleaguered owner of a flavor-extract factory, contending with difficult employees, a looming lawsuit over an assembly-line mishap, a distant wife (Kristen Wiig) and his own adulterous urges.

“Extract,” which Mr. Judge started writing shortly after the release of “Office Space,” was “a conscious decision to tell it from the other side,” he said.

“Here the employees are the bad  well, not really the bad guys but the annoying guys,” he continued.

For “Office Space,” an expansion of the “Milton” animated shorts that appeared on “Saturday Night Live” in the early 1990s, Mr. Judge drew on the many day jobs he had held in his 20s, when he wasn’t playing bass in blues-rock bands or teaching himself animation. One temp position he had while a student at the University of California, San Diego, required him to alphabetize purchase orders, the same mind-numbing task he assigned to the Milton character in the movie.

After graduating with a degree in physics, Mr. Judge worked in a series of engineering jobs  testing flight software, developing interfaces for early high-resolution screens  that schooled him in the crushing monotony of cubicle life and the passive-aggressive cadences of corporate speak.

“Extract” comes from a later period in Mr. Judge’s life, when “Beavis and Butt-Head” had become a cultural phenomenon. (It spawned a feature film in 1996.) “I’d never had anyone work for me before,” he said. “And then I had anywhere from 30 to 90 people working for me at any given time. I started to sympathize with my old bosses.”

Despite the shift from a labor to a management perspective Mr. Judge displays his common man’s touch in “Extract.” Joel is a hardworking self-made entrepreneur, and the movie offers a rare glimpse  rare for a contemporary American movie at any rate  into the rhythms of an industrial workplace. Mr. Judge’s ability to inhabit opposing perspectives with empathy and humor is a hallmark of his observational approach; his latest series, “The Goode Family,” gently lampoons do-gooding liberals much as “King of the Hill” fondly ribs compassionate conservatives. (ABC recently announced that it would not be renewing “The Goode Family,” but the show’s producers said they expect it to find a new home soon.)

Like so much else in Mr. Judge’s work, the setting of “Extract” reflects the director’s varied pre-showbiz résumé, which includes a few stints at manufacturing plants, working for a company that made guitar amplifiers and another that packaged snack trays for offices.

“I was always interested in food flavoring,” he said matter-of-factly. (He pointed out that Austin, Tex., where he has lived since the early ’90s, is home to the Adams Extract Company.) “I like watching the Food Network and seeing how they make Twinkies. There’s something about mass-producing food we take for granted.”
782 2009-08-30 Before he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature last October, J. M. G. Le Clézio had only the faintest of presences in America. Readers may or may not have remembered him as the handsome young Franco-Mauritian who in the early days of le nouveau roman had won the Prix Renaudot for his first novel, an aimless, intriguing experiment called “The Interrogation” (“Le Procès-Verbal”). By the late 1970s, Le Clézio, who has known many countries, had turned to his habit of travel for inspiration and was exploring distant landscapes and primitive cultures in books like “Desert” (“Désert”), which won another prestigious prize in France. “Desert,” however, was never published in English. Before the Nobel, Le Clézio’s early experimental novels had fallen out of print, and his latest works, drawn from his childhood and his concerns about the environment, had received passing notice. Le Clézio himself is said to be reclusive and keeps a low profile. His sudden eminence is understandably something of a wonder.

The American publication of “Desert” is therefore an event, bringing into closer range one of the leading writers in France. “Desert” is a rich, sprawling, searching, poetic, provocative, broadly historic and demanding novel, which in all those ways displays the essence of Le Clézio. As a reflection on colonization and its legacy, it is painfully relevant after 30 years. Weaving together two stories that span the 20th century, Le Clézio tells of the last days of the Tuareg, the desert warriors known as the blue men, who are being driven from their ancestral lands in North Africa by the French colonial army and “the new order,” and in counterpoint, the travails of a later generation trapped in the projects and shantytowns of Tangier and Marseille. His central characters are the stalwart young boy Nour, who in 1909 is migrating north across the Western Sahara in a caravan of nomadic Berber tribes, and a dreamy, copper-skinned young orphan named Lalla, descended from the blue men, whose parentage helps her survive immigrant life in the 1970s. There are secondary characters, historical figures like the legendary sheik Ma al-Ainine, revered by his people and demonized as a fanatic by the French, and such fablelike creations as Lalla’s two kindred spirits (the Hartani, a mute shepherd who can communicate with animals, and Naman, the old fisherman who tells her wise ­stories) or the pretty Gypsy boy Radicz, who is being trained as a thief on the streets of Marseille. In an important way, however, the presiding force of “Desert” is the land itself. As the omission of the definite article in the title seems to suggest, the desert, the jagged rocks and blistering heat, the maze of dunes, the waves of open space, “timeless,” “deep in their bodies,” is not only a setting, but also a kingdom, a resource and a state of mind.

“Desert” moves slowly, its pace set in the beginning by the tortuous trek across the Sahara and by Le Clézio’s way with language — the minutely detailed descriptions of the suffering, the recurring images of the sky, birds, the wind and light, the long waves of insistent prose designed to saturate and surround, like music. Repetitions are deliberate, rhythmic, metaphors are meant to enlighten and reflect. “Men go out into the desert, and they are like ships at sea; no one knows when they will return.” Le Clézio is writing about people who are close to the earth and sea, whose stories come from there, and at the same time about the vast epic of nature and its sustaining force. The connection between the land and all its creatures, humans, plants, animals, insects, has been a passionate theme in Le Clézio’s later work, and it is the lesson of Nour and more directly Lalla, who, to escape the harsh realities of her life, inhabits the mystical world of her ancestors, fed by visions of whirling winds and glistening sand and her communion with al-Ser, the spirit of the blue man warrior, “a dream that has come from afar.” He has the light of the desert in his eyes, as Lalla does too, which helps account for her success as the international fashion model Hawa — a career she abandons to return to her old neighborhood in Tangier and give birth.

Le Clézio is an unusual storyteller, often called difficult or unclassifiable, which he says is only appropriate to a novelist and the brew of ideas called the novel. His work, more than 40 books of both fiction and nonfiction, has been shaped by his mixed roots and his own wanderings — born in France of a family who had lived for generations on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, he grew up thinking that there was a somewhere else that embodied his homeland — and he writes from experience, bearing witness but, as he says, without giving a message in the manner that Camus and Sartre did. Camus, a Nobel laureate a half-century ago, who grew up in French Algeria, comes to mind in reading “Desert,” for his own lyric descriptions of the desert and sea and the invisibility of the poor, and for his own feelings about colonialism and the indigenous culture of Algeria. Camus, like Le Clézio, wrote directly about experience and also about what Le Clézio calls the contradiction of experience, referring in particular to Camus’s dilemma during the Algerian war when he was unable to choose between the independence and his love of his native land. The tragedy of the Algerian war, like his memories of African chain gangs building a swimming pool in Nigeria or, later, his four years living with the Emberas Indians in the forests of Panama, lie behind Le Clézio’s compassionate attitude toward the third world and his empathy for the blue men and other native cultures. He is the sum of images from every­where, he has said in interviews. “My books are what resemble me most.”

There is an element of the missionary in Le Clézio, just as there is still something of the rebel in him, in search of the new novel, trying to break loose from the traditional bonds of fiction and language to mirror a wider world — as the Nobel citation described, to explore “a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.” Beneath his pantheism and ethnology, there is also a serious critic of contemporary Western civilization and its rationalism, pointing out the conflict between nature and cities, the disconnect between man and mythology. In “Desert,” a powerful anger erupts in his portrayal of the underbelly of Marseille and the lost people that poverty has brought to France, people who “don’t exist because they leave no trace of their passage.” Le Clézio, who has dual passports from France and Mauritius and now spends part of the year in New Mexico, thinks of himself as an exile too, who finds his home in the French language.
783 2009-08-30 I’m aware of one — one — reader who doesn’t care for Lorrie Moore, and even that one seems a little apologetic about it. “Too . . . punny,” my friend explains, resorting to a pun as though hypnotized by the very tendency that sets off his resistance. For others, Moore may be, exactly, the most irresistible contemporary Ameri­can writer: brainy, humane, unpretentious and warm; seemingly effortlessly lyrical; Lily-Tomlin-funny. Most of all, Moore is capable of enlisting not just our sympathies but our sorrows. Her last book, the 1998 story collection “Birds of America,” included the unforgettable baby-with-­cancer story “People Like That Are the Only People Here,” a breathtakingly dark overture to a decade’s silence — as if the Beatles had exited on “A Day in the Life.” For many readers, the fact that Moore has now relieved an 11-year publishing hiatus is reason enough to start Google-mapping a route to the nearest surviving bookstore.

If American fiction writers largely find themselves sorted tediously into the category of “natural” at either the short or the long form, regardless of the extent of their commitment to both, then Moore — justly celebrated for her three story collections — has surely been counted as a miniaturist. This book should spell the end of that. “A Gate at the Stairs” is more expansive than either of her two previous novels, the slender, Nabokovian “Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?” and the structurally dizzy novel-as-set-of-­variations “Anagrams.” It’s also a novel that brandishes some “big” material: racism, war, etc. — albeit in Moore’s resolutely insouciant key.

The novel’s protagonist and narrator, Tassie Keltjin, is a student at a Midwestern college mecca, daughter of a boutique potato cultivator, who finds work as the nanny-in-waiting for a brainy couple awkwardly on the verge of adoption. This ambiguous assignment takes the foreground in a tale ranging over Tassie’s home life and love life — the nest she’s just departed and the nest she’s hoping to flutter into. Moore’s class diagnostics are so exact she can make us feel the uneasiness not only between town and country in a single landlocked state, but between different types of farmers on neighboring plots. The book is also set in the autumn of 2001, a fact Moore has the patience to barely deploy for 200 pages, and then only with a deft sleight of hand that will make readers reflect on the ways so many other treatments of this (unfinished) passage in American life have resembled heart surgery performed with a croquet mallet.

In a 2005 interview, Moore made an allusion to this “post-9/11” aspect of the work that grew into this novel: “I’m . . . interested in the way that the workings of governments and elected officials intrude upon the lives and minds of people who feel generally safe from the immediate effects of such workings.” The delicacy of this remark fails to disguise its clarity of purpose, and, as it happens, distant inter­national affairs are by no means the only source of “intrusion” in “A Gate at the Stairs.” Moore’s continuing interest in how power imbalances make themselves felt in human encounters fastens here on the Kafka-worthy bureaucracy of adoption agencies and foster homes. Combined with her immaculately tender portrayals of young children, so real you want to pass around their snapshots, this aspect of her novel will do such things to your heart that you may find yourself wishing for the surgeon with the croquet mallet, just for mercy.

Moore’s cast is sneaky-large (she’s like an athlete you keep wanting to call sneaky-fast, or sneaky-tough). Any of Tassie’s relationships — like that with her adoption-seeking employer Sarah Brink, or her vivid goof of a younger brother, or her exotic first love interest, Reynaldo (whom she meets in “Intro to Sufism”) — may seem this book’s essential one, at least while it assumes center stage. But the novel’s real essence is its sinuous roving spotlight, in which each character and element is embraced in Tassie’s wondering and exact sensibility, as when with her brother she revisits a childhood haunt:

“When the gnats weren’t bad I had sometimes accompanied him, sat in the waist-high widgeon grass beside him, the place pink with coneflowers, telling him the plot of, say, a Sam Peckinpah movie I’d never seen but had read about once in a syndicated article in The Dellacrosse Sunday Star. Crickets the size of your thumb would sing their sweet monotony from the brush. Sometimes there was a butterfly so perfect and beautiful, it was like a party barrette you wanted to clip in your hair. Above and around us green leaves would flash wet with sunsetting light. In this verdant cove I recounted the entire plot of ‘Straw Dogs.’ . . . Now we stood at the cold stream’s edge, tossing a stone in and listening for its plonk and plummet. I wanted to say, ‘Remember the time . . .’ But too often when we compared stories from our childhood, they didn’t match. I would speak of a trip or a meal or a visit from a cousin and of something that had happened during it, and Robert would look at me as if I were speaking of the adventures of some Albanian rock band. So I stayed quiet with him. It is something that people who have been children together can effortlessly do. It is sometimes preferable to the talk, which is also effortless. We found more stones and tossed them. ‘A stone can’t drown,’ said my brother finally. ‘It’s already drowned.’ ‘You been reading poetry?’ I smiled at him.”

As for the puns, they seem to me less an eagerness to entertain than a true writerly obsession. Moore is an equal-opportunity japester: heroes and villains both crack wise with Chandleresque vivacity, so you can’t use cleverness as a moral index. The wrinkly recursiveness of her language seems lodged at the layer of consciousness itself, where Moore demands readers’ attention to the innate thingliness of words. This includes not only their plastic capacity as puns, and the oddnesses residing in the names for food, foliage and products — for instance, the fact that probably no bachelor ever wore the flowers called “bachelor buttons,” or that a fabric’s neutral hue can be awarded names as various as pigeon, parmesan, platinum or pebble — but also their potential use as deliberate uncommunication: “ ‘Sounds good,’ I sang out into the dark of the car. Sounds good, that same Midwestern girl’s slightly frightened reply. It appeared to clinch a deal, and was meant to sound the same as the more soldierly Good to go, except it was promiseless — mere affirmative description.”

Finally, this book plumbs deep because it is anchored deep, in a system of natural imagery as tightly organized as that in a cycle of poems like Ted Hughes’s “Crow.” The motif is birth, gestation and burial, a seed or fetus uncovering its nature in secrecy, a coffin being offered to the earth. The motif declares itself upfront in Tassie’s father’s potatoes, which like sleeper cells grow clustered in darkness and then, unearthed, assume names: Klamath pearls, yellow fingerlings, purple Peruvians and Rose Finns. In “A Gate at the Stairs” it is not just potatoes that adapt for the world behind assumed names, but babies and grown-ups too.

Great writers usually present us with mysteries, but the mystery Lorrie Moore presents consists of appearing genial, joshing and earnest at once — unmysterious, in other words, yet still great. She’s a discomfiting, sometimes even rageful writer, lurking in the disguise of an endearing one. On finishing “A Gate at the Stairs” I turned to the reader nearest to me and made her swear to read it immediately (well, the dog was between us, but she doesn’t read much, and none of what I recommend). I might even urge it on my dissenting friend.
784 2009-08-30 Barracks went up, a kitchen, a mess hall. Those assigned to the camp — perhaps 3,000 during the corps’ life span — worked throughout the national forest, opening roads and creating recreation facilities.

The camp buildings vanished years ago. Only small signs disclose the layout: barracks here, recreation hall there. But I like to imagine that amid the summery buzz of insects, I hear boisterous laughter as I walk pathways lined with stones the boys laid down.

Ten miles away, atop the Blue Ridge, Shenandoah National Park flaunts its conservation corps legacy. Beside the visitor center at Big Meadows on Skyline Drive stands a bronze statue of the archetypal C.C.C. boy. Shirtless, ax at his side, he represents the swarms of workers — some 10,000 or more — that the corps provided to help develop the park in the 1930s.

The visitor center looks out on a broad, grassy sweep — the meadows — where one of Shenandoah’s 10 C.C.C. camps stood. “Around where the barracks were, you can still find lilac bushes that the boys brought from home,” Julena Campbell, supervisory park ranger, told me recently. “Imagine those rough-tough guys bringing lilacs up here.” Those rough-tough guys also planted more than 200,000 trees and shrubs to beautify and restore eroded areas.

Wavley Groves of Chesapeake, Va., now 91, spent part of his two corps years taking Shenandoah’s trees down. “There was a ghost forest when I got there,” he recalled. “My first job was cutting those trees with a crosscut saw.” The ghostly trees were chestnuts killed by blight, but still standing and spooky when sheathed in ice or frost.

The logs were a bonanza; chestnut was a versatile, rot-resistant wood. In a corps sawmill the logs became planks, beams and shingles. Some of that lumber went into Big Meadows Lodge, imparting a mellow warmth to the walls and vaulted ceilings of its spacious public rooms.

Lunching there on a visit this summer, my wife, Jennifer, and I marveled at the Bunyanesque layering of the featured sandwich, the C.C.C. Club, presumably a testimonial to members’ appetites. In truth, lunch sandwiches for the actual C.C.C. boys were bologna or peanut butter and jelly.

We stayed at the park’s other large hostelry, Skyland Resort. Its cabins, many with a vintage patina, are scattered over a campus that also includes a commodious dining room. Both Skyland and Big Meadows offer the perfect setting for turning off the world. Simply request one of the many accommodations without TV. None has a telephone, and cellphone reception can be just about nil. Come morning, the silence impels you to look outside, and there on the dewy grass a half-dozen robins are jauntily cavorting.

Along Skyline Drive, the sinuous 105-mile thread that runs the length of the park, climbing up to 3,500 feet, corps crews provided 60 scenic overlooks, picnic areas, guardrails, campgrounds and dozens of miles of trails.

At its southern terminus, the drive joins the much longer Blue Ridge Parkway, which continues 469 miles to Cherokee, N.C. Four thousand C.C.C. boys worked along the parkway, according to Harley Jolley of Mars Hill, N.C., a historian and a corps alumnus. “Landscaping was the primary job,” he said, “but they also did hiking trails, campgrounds and shelters. It was a fabulous contribution.”

“Fabulous,” I submit, isn’t too potent a word to describe the corps’ work in a Virginia state park called Douthat, a 45-minute drive west of the parkway, near the town of Clifton Forge. Virginia had no state parks until the conservation corps came along and built six, aided by National Park Service expertise. The inventory in Douthat includes trails, a 50-acre lake, stone bridges, a lodge, a dining hall, a bathhouse and picnic pavilions. In a blacksmith’s shop, preserved with its authentic grime, young smiths forged hinges, locks and other hardware.

That ironwork embellishes Douthat’s most intriguing feature, 25 log cabins. “Douthat was a guinea-pig park,” Charles Conner, the park manager, said. “They used a lot of different floor plans, trying them out.” No two are identical. Three cabins were constructed with logs set vertically, a highly unusual style. Douthat officials scrupulously maintain the original exteriors. Some of the tested plans were replicated in other parks; besides its contributions in Virginia, the corps built cabins in numerous other states.

Jennifer and I stayed in No. 6, a one-room cabin. With its two rocking chairs, the front porch was a joy. As night fell, frogs down by the lake serenaded in basso profundo. On such an evening, it is easy to conclude that not everything about the Great Depression was bad.

808 2009-08-31 “The brand wouldn’t be where it is today without the N.F.L.,” said Michael Barkley, vice president for ready-to-serve soup at Campbell in Camden, N.J.

But the football-centric campaigns that featured players like Donovan McNabb, LaDainian Tomlinson and Kurt Warner — and, in some years, mothers of players — are being benched. The spotlight is turning to blue-collar men who work in shipyards or quarries and on farms and who come home to children they play with and help care for.

Instead of slogans replete with football references like “Meals that fill you up right,” and comparisons of playing pro football to “a day working the line,” the new campaign is more straightforward, offering observations like this: “A man’s got to eat. He just wants to eat better.”

It is “a decision that isn’t taken lightly,” Mr. Barkley said, particularly since the football campaigns helped Chunky — the second-largest Campbell brand, behind only the mainstay red-and-white soups — double its sales from 1997 to 2o02.

But research showed that the Chunky brand had recently “lost some relevance” with its core consumers, he added, men ages 35 and older.

And sales have declined for the last three of Campbell’s fiscal years, according to data from Information Resources Inc., with the slump accelerating: down 6.4 percent in fiscal 2007, 12.4 percent in fiscal 2008 and 14.7 percent in fiscal 2009. (The Campbell fiscal year typically runs from early August through late July.)

To reverse that trend, Mr. Barkley said, Chunky ads, previously aimed more at men than women, will also try to speak to the wives and mothers who typically buy the food for their families.

“To get to the guy,” he added, “we have to get the stamp of approval from the female head of household.” So ads will run on Web sites like foodnetwork.com and ivillage.com as well as menshealth.com and nfl.com, and in magazines like Cosmopolitan and male titles like Men’s Health.

The media agency for Chunky is Mediaedge:cia in New York, part of the GroupM unit of WPP.

The differences from the previous campaigns are also meant to signal that there is “news about the product,” Mr. Barkley said, in the form of recipe changes like adding more vegetables and lean meat.

To make the campaign more realistic, the commercials were cast and filmed in Seattle, he said, using “regular blue-collar workers with day jobs” instead of actors.

Each commercial shows a man working hard at a hard job as these words appear on screen: “Why we made Campbell’s Chunky soup.” As they arrive home, greeting their children, these words appear: “Why we’re making it better.”

And like a regular guy who puts his money where his mouth is, Campbell will increase the marketing budget for Chunky in fiscal 2010 by 50 percent, to more than $30 million.

The Chunky changes are being made as some see a trend toward romancing the blue-collar trades, which coincides with the recession’s doubts about white-collar pursuits like investment banking, mortgage brokering and whatever it is that hedge fund managers do.

Although that is not the reason for the overhaul, “as a brand we need to be the everyday guy’s advocate and celebrate him,” said James Caporimo, executive vice president and group creative director at the Y&R New York office.

That contrasts with situation comedies and ads in which “this guy is always the butt of the joke,” he added, mocked or portrayed as an obtuse dolt despite how “he breaks his pick all day long” for his family.

As valuable as football players have been to Chunky, Mr. Caporimo said, they are celebrities rather than workaday men.

So a decision was made to focus on “that blue-collar guy doing his job, not hating it, doing it with a lot of gusto,” he said.

Gusto? That invokes another venerable beer campaign, for Schlitz, which advised men to “grab for all the gusto you can get.”
809 2009-08-31 But as VMware’s technology becomes more powerful and it adds more features to its products, it can start to supplant the operating system from below — just as the browser can from above.

VMware’s leadership adds an edge to its bottom-up challenge to Microsoft. A year ago, Paul Maritz, a former senior executive at Microsoft, took over as chief executive. In the late 1990s, he was regarded as the company’s third-ranked executive, the person with the most responsibility and authority after Bill Gates and Steven A. Ballmer.

Mr. Maritz walked away from Microsoft a wealthy man in 2000, and he focused mainly on philanthropic work like microfinance, conservation and rural development projects, especially in Africa (he was born and raised in Zimbabwe). In 2003, he founded a small Web start-up company, but his business interests were a far cry from the mainstream of corporate combat.

The lure at VMware, Mr. Maritz explained, was the chance to lead a company riding a wave of game-changing technology. “It’s a rare opportunity to be part of a paradigm shift,” he said. “That’s what attracted me.”

In January, Mr. Maritz was joined by Tod Nielsen, another former Microsoft executive, who became VMware’s chief operating officer.

As 11,000 business partners, developers and customers gather in San Francisco for the start of the company’s VMworld conference on Monday, the strategy under Mr. Maritz is clearly taking shape. In August, the company announced that it planned to pay $420 million to acquire SpringSource, a maker of open-source software development tools, some of which analyze and tweak the performance of applications. Adding such features could allow VMware’s technology to essentially sidestep an operating system like Windows.

“It makes us far less dependent on the operating system to manage the applications,” Mr. Nielsen said.

So far, virtualization technology has been used mainly to cut costs in data centers, where it lets companies handle computing chores with fewer machines, using less energy and floor space. Now, companies are starting to use it to manage software that is delivered to their workers on desktop PCs across the corporate network.

VMware plans to make a big push into the desktop and notebook market, introducing technology next year to better handle high-end graphics and allow users to do work even when they are not hooked into a network.

In data centers, VMware wants to demonstrate that beyond the hardware savings, the next frontier is the reduced operating costs that result from increasing the number of servers that are “virtualized.”

Today, VMware says companies typically have one human administrator for every 50 server computers, while data centers with more than half of their machines virtualized can fairly quickly increase that to one to 200 or higher.

“We have to go beyond capital costs to speak to doing more for our customers by using virtualization to reduce operating costs and operational complexity,” Mr. Maritz said. “We are entering a significant turn in this market.”

And, he observed, “we do have the footsteps of Microsoft behind us.”

Indeed, Microsoft is coming. Its game plan is a rerun of the strategy it used in the Web browser market — bundle free virtual machine software into its operating system. In July 2009, Microsoft introduced its HyperV virtual machine in Windows Server 2008. New features to help it catch up to VMware will be introduced in October.

“Our strategy is to integrate virtualization into our product line in Windows, with our management software and the familiar Microsoft developer tools,” said Mike Neil, a general manager in the Windows server division.

Microsoft has a long way to go. At the end of last year, more than 80 percent of virtualized computing workloads ran on VMware, analysts estimate, with the remainder shared by Microsoft, Citrix Systems’ Xen, Virtual Iron and others. But only 15 percent of servers have been virtualized, and with that percentage likely to at least double over the next five years, there is still plenty of opportunity in the market.

There is considerable interest in Microsoft’s offering, analysts say. A recent report by Gartner projected that Microsoft’s share of installed virtual machine software would increase to 29 percent by the end of 2012, from 8 percent at the end of last year.

“Microsoft is going to be very formidable in this space,” said Stephen F. Shuckenbrock, president of the large enterprise division at Dell, which is a partner of both VMware and Microsoft. “Many customers, at the very least, are intrigued by the free virtualization software bundled by Microsoft.”

VMware, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is a formidable company today, solidly profitable with $1.9 billion in revenue last year. (It is majority owned by EMC but reports financial results separately and has its own stock listing.) The company Mr. Maritz inherited last year, when the founders, Diane Greene, the chief executive, and her husband, Mendel Rosenblum, a Stanford computer scientist, departed, had a “great foundation with wonderful people and wonderful technology,” Mr. Maritz said.

Still, Mr. Maritz added, VMware needed to move up the technology ladder and “master some new tricks” to stay ahead of Microsoft. Whether it can do that in the long run is the big question surrounding the company.

“It has fantastic technology, but will it be a fantastic business?” asked A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “The browser was fantastic technology, but it turned out not to be good business.”

Both Mr. Maritz and Mr. Nielsen are veterans of the browser wars of the 1990s, from the Microsoft side. They are optimistic that VMware can stay ahead. “This is going to be a battle for sure,” Mr. Nielsen said. “But we are going to stay focused and continue to outrun them.”
810 2009-08-31 Nixon also embraced tighter regulation of insurers, calling on states to “approve specific plans, oversee rates, ensure adequate disclosure, require an annual audit and take other appropriate measures.” No illusions there about how the magic of the marketplace solves all problems.

So what happened to the days when a Republican president could sound so nonideological, and offer such a reasonable proposal?

Part of the answer is that the right-wing fringe, which has always been around — as an article by the historian Rick Perlstein puts it, “crazy is a pre-existing condition” — has now, in effect, taken over one of our two major parties. Moderate Republicans, the sort of people with whom one might have been able to negotiate a health care deal, have either been driven out of the party or intimidated into silence. Whom are Democrats supposed to reach out to, when Senator of , who was supposed to be the linchpin of any deal, helped feed the “death panel” lies?

But there’s another reason health care reform is much harder now than it would have been under Nixon: the vast expansion of corporate influence.

We tend to think of the way things are now, with a huge army of lobbyists permanently camped in the corridors of power, with corporations prepared to unleash misleading ads and organize fake grass-roots protests against any legislation that threatens their bottom line, as the way it always was. But our corporate-cash-dominated system is a relatively recent creation, dating mainly from the late 1970s.

And now that this system exists, reform of any kind has become extremely difficult. That’s especially true for health care, where growing spending has made the vested interests far more powerful than they were in Nixon’s day. The health insurance industry, in particular, saw its premiums go from 1.5 percent of in 1970 to 5.5 percent in 2007, so that a once minor player has become a political behemoth, one that is currently spending $1.4 million a day lobbying Congress.

That spending fuels debates that otherwise seem incomprehensible. Why are “centrist” Democrats like Senator of so opposed to letting a public plan, in which Americans can buy their insurance directly from the government, compete with private insurers? Never mind their often incoherent arguments; what it comes down to is the money.

Given the combination of extremism and corporate power, it’s now doubtful whether health reform, even if we get it — which is by no means certain — will be anywhere near as good as Nixon’s proposal, even though Democrats control the White House and have a large Congressional majority.

And what about other challenges? Every desperately needed reform I can think of, from controlling greenhouse gases to restoring fiscal balance, will have to run the same gantlet of lobbying and lies.

I’m not saying that reformers should give up. They do, however, have to realize what they’re up against. There was a lot of talk last year about how would be a “transformational” president — but true transformation, it turns out, requires a lot more than electing one telegenic leader. Actually turning this country around is going to take years of siege warfare against deeply entrenched interests, defending a deeply dysfunctional political system.
811 2009-08-31 “The taxpayers want their money back and they want the government out of our banking system,” Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican and a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel examining the relief program, said in an interview.

Profits were hardly high on the list of government priorities last October, when a financial panic was in full swing and the Treasury Department started spending roughly $240 billion to buy preferred shares from hundreds of banks that were facing huge potential losses from troubled mortgages. Bank began teetering after collapsed and the government rescued A.I.G., and fear gripped the financial industry around the world.

American taxpayers were told they would eventually make a modest return from these , including a 5 percent quarterly dividend on the banks’ preferred shares and warrants to buy stock in the banks at a set price over 10 years.

But critics at the time warned that taxpayers might not see any profits, and that it could take years for the banks to repay the .

As Congress debated the bailout bill last September that would authorize the Treasury Department to spend up to $700 billion to stem the , Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas, said: “Seven hundred billion dollars of taxpayer money should not be used as a hopeful experiment.”

So far, that experiment is more than paying off. The government has taken profits of about $1.4 billion on its investment in , $1.3 billion on and $414 million on . The five other banks that repaid the government — , , State Street, and — each brought in $100 million to $334 million in profit.

The figure does not include the roughly $35 million the government has earned from 14 smaller banks that have paid back their loans. The government bought shares in these and many other financial companies last fall, when sinking confidence among investors pushed down many bank stocks to just a few dollars a share. As the banks strengthened and became profitable, the government authorized them to pay back the preferred stock, which had been paying quarterly dividends since October.

But the real profit came as banks were permitted to buy back the so-called warrants, whose low fixed price provided a windfall for the government as the shares of the companies soared.

Despite the early proceeds from the bailout program, a debate remains over whether the government could have done even better with its bank investments.

If private investors had taken a stake in the banks last October on par with the government’s, they would have had profits three times as large — about $12 billion, or 44 percent if tallied on an annual basis, according to Linus Wilson, a finance professor at the University of at , who analyzed the data for The Times.

Why the discrepancy? Finance experts say the government overpaid for the bank assets it bought, because its chief priority was to stabilize the teetering financial system, not to maximize profit.

“Had these banks tried to raise money any other way, they probably would have had to pay quite a bit more than the government received,” said Espen Robak, head of Pluris Valuation Advisors, which analyzes the value of large financial institutions.

A Congressional oversight panel concluded in February that the Treasury paid an average of 34 percent more than the estimated fair value of the assets it received.

Of course, many finance experts suggest that the comparison is academic at best, because there is no way to know what might have become of the banks or the financial system as a whole had the government not acted.

“Taxpayers should heave a sigh of relief that the investment in the banks protected them from even more catastrophic losses from more bank failures,” said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business at .

A more direct comparison of profits can be made with the investment performance of other governments that poured money into ailing banks last fall.

The Swiss government, for example, said last week that it had pulled in a handsome profit for taxpayers on a $5.6 billion bailout it gave to , the troubled Swiss bank, at the height of the financial crisis in October. The government netted $1 billion on its investment, a gain equal to a 32 percent annual return.

“They are substantially in the money,” Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Henderson New Star in , said after the announcement.

American taxpayers could still collect additional profits on their investments in two other big banks that have repaid their preferred stock but not their warrants: and . They are expected to yield over $3.1 billion in gains for the Treasury in the next month or so, although the full tally will depend on how much they will pay to buy back their warrants.

And the government is owed about $6.2 billion in interest payments from banks that have not yet repaid their federal money.

But all the profits taxpayers have won could still be wiped out by two deeply troubled institutions. Both and are still holding mortgages and other loans that were once worth billions of dollars but whose revised values are uncertain. If they prove “toxic” because they cannot attract buyers, they could leave large holes in the banks’ balance sheets.

Neither bank is ready to repay its bailout money anytime soon, even though the banks’ stock prices have surged in the last month, leaving the government sitting on paper profits of about $18 billion between them.
812 2009-08-31 Freedom Communications, owner of The Orange County Register and 30 other daily newspapers, is expected to file for bankruptcy this week under a plan that will hand its publications to its lenders, people briefed on the matter said on Sunday.

A filing by Freedom, which could be made as soon as Tuesday, would be the latest by a newspaper publisher, as the industry struggles to cope with declining advertising revenue and heavy debt loads.

Several big publishers have already declared bankruptcy in the last 12 months, including the Tribune Company and the owner of Philadelphia’s two major papers.

According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, The Orange County Register had an average weekday circulation of 230,877 and Sunday circulation of about 300,000 for the six months ended on March 31. The company also owns several broadcast stations nationwide.

Freedom’s bankruptcy will most likely wipe out the 45 percent equity stake held by two big private equity firms, the Blackstone Group and Providence Equity Partners.
813 2009-08-31 At a time when most newspapers are hungry for any ads they can sell, Newsday has turned away a steady, lucrative customer that is also a direct competitor of the paper’s parent company, Cablevision.

Verizon Communications bought full-page ads in Newsday several times a month for its FiOS Internet and television service until a few months ago, when the paper said it would no longer take them, according to a Verizon executive and ad buyers who work with the company.

“They made it clear we didn’t need to keep calling,” said Eric Rabe, a senior vice president of Verizon. He and others involved said that Newsday had offered no explanation and had not objected to the content of the ads.

But FiOS is a leading competitor on Long Island to Cablevision, the dominant provider of pay television and high-speed Internet in that market. Since last year, Cablevision has also owned Newsday, the region’s dominant newspaper. It also owns News 12, a Long Island local news station, giving it a hold on information delivery that is unmatched by a single company in any other large market in the country.

This month, Newsday rejected an ad from the Tennis Channel that had criticized Cablevision for not carrying the channel and had invited consumers to find it on competing pay television services like FiOS, DirecTV or the Dish Network.
814 2009-08-31 In a lengthy interview last week at Microsoft’s headquarters, Mr. Lu said he was not underestimating the challenge. But over time, he said, Microsoft has a chance to offer a service that is different and compelling enough to compete effectively.

For Microsoft, succeeding in search is vital to the company’s long-term health. For Mr. Lu, it is a mission he felt obligated to take on.

“I do think that this is answering a call to duty,” he said. Wearing a Bing T-shirt tucked into jeans held up by a black leather belt and wearing brown sandals and white socks, the wiry Mr. Lu looked more like an engineer than a senior executive.

And with an engineer’s logic, he laid out his reasons for returning to the fray. Search determines where users go online, and search advertising is the most powerful economic force on the Internet. The business is too important to be controlled by a single company, he says.

Having grown up poor in China, Mr. Lu said, he feels duty-bound not to squander the rare opportunity he was given. He was raised by his grandparents in a rural village with no electricity or running water.

His intelligence got him into Fudan University in Shanghai. After finishing his master’s degree in computer science, he attended a talk given by Edmund M. Clarke, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon. Impressed by Mr. Lu’s questions and research, Professor Clarke invited him to apply to a doctorate program.

Mr. Lu, who earned about $10 a month teaching at the university, could not afford even the application fee, so the professor arranged for the fee to be waived and Mr. Lu was admitted.

Mr. Lu says the challenges he faced growing up turned out to be a blessing: “You can say it’s harsh, but it teaches you so many things.”

After earning his Ph.D. in 1996, he went to work at one of I.B.M.’s prestigious research labs.

He was lured to Yahoo in 1998. A few years later, as Google and Yahoo squared off, he headed the development of Yahoo’s search and search advertising technologies.

By all accounts, Mr. Lu poured his heart and soul into the mission. Hired as an engineer, he rose through the ranks not by personal ambition but rather through sheer intellectual ability and his willingness to take on ever larger roles. Eventually, he ran a team of about 3,000 engineers.

“He shunned the limelight, but he was considered one of the stars of Yahoo,” said Tim Cadogan, the chief executive of Open X, an advertising technology company, who worked closely with Mr. Lu at Yahoo.

Mr. Lu’s colleagues at Yahoo and Microsoft say his intellect is matched only by his work habits. He sleeps three to four hours a night. One most weekdays, he wakes up around 4 a.m., goes through his e-mail and runs four miles on a treadmill while listening to classical music or watching the news.

He prefers to be in his office between 5 and 6 a.m. to have uninterrupted time to prepare for his day. He is often sending e-mail to his staff until midnight or later. (Mr. Lu, who is married and has two daughters, reserves much of the weekend to spend with his family.)

When he first met Mr. Lu, Jeff Weiner, a former senior executive at Yahoo who worked closely with him for years, thought his punishing schedule was not sustainable. But Mr. Lu’s manager brushed aside Mr. Weiner’s concerns, saying “That’s just Qi,” (pronounced Chee).

“I look back on that because of the number of people who came to me since to express concerns, and I said ‘that’s just Qi,’ ” said Mr. Weiner, who is now chief executive of LinkedIn, a social networking site. “He is not wired like everyone else. Anyone else doing that would be burnt to a crisp, but Qi was one of the most productive people I’ve ever worked with.”

His work ethic and intellectual ability have earned him praise from rivals. “I have the highest respect for him,” said Udi Manber, a vice president of engineering for search at Google, who worked with Mr. Lu at I.B.M. and Yahoo. “He is probably the best competition I can have.”

Mr. Lu’s discipline also expresses itself as loyalty. On his last day at Yahoo, for example, a problem came up with a database, and he worked side by side with his engineers trying to fix it. He left only when, at midnight, his e-mail and network access were automatically cut off.

Furthermore, Mr. Lu declined to talk with Mr. Ballmer, who had become interested in meeting him, until after his long-planned departure from Yahoo because he thought it would be improper.

Mr. Lu was contemplating opportunities in venture capital and even thought of returning to China. But he changed those plans after Mr. Ballmer flew to Silicon Valley with two Microsoft engineering executives to meet Mr. Lu to informally discuss the search business.

“He walked out of the room and I’m talking to the other two guys and I say, ‘God, I think we ought to talk to that guy about coming to Microsoft,’ ” Mr. Ballmer said in an interview. They immediately called Mr. Lu on his cellphone, Mr. Ballmer said. “He came on back, and we started the dialogue about him joining the company, which eventually bore fruit.”

Mr. Lu knows it will take much longer for his own mission to bear fruit. “There is lots and lots and lots of work ahead of us,” he said.
