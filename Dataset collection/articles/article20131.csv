"'171','2013-01-18','A lithium-ion battery works like most other chemical batteries. A particle with an electric charge (in this case, a lithium ion) moves to one terminal when energy is applied, and the other terminal when energy is drawn off.

Lithium-ion batteries are actually a family of batteries because the chemistry of the terminal and other parts varies. They have a higher energy density, which means they can store more kilowatt-hours of work per unit of weight and volume than other chemistries.

But they have drawbacks. One is that while all batteries get warm, which makes some of their parts expand, the chemical soup in which the ions in a lithium-ion battery swim, the electrolyte, expands more than the electrolytes of other chemistries, experts say. Because a lithium-ion battery is always sealed, it has to withstand the pressure of the expansion. Otherwise, it will break open or break internally.

The electrolyte in a lithium-ion battery includes hydrocarbons. So it will burn or at least undergo a chemical reaction somewhere short of fire that generates heat and smoke. If the electrolyte in a lead-acid battery escapes, it will cause problems but it will not burn.

All batteries generate heat on charging and discharging. No rechargeable chemical batteries are 100 percent efficient. In other words, they never give back quite as much energy as was put into them. The energy that does not make the round trip ends up as heat.

If the lithium-ion battery is small, then it has a big surface area compared with the volume of its ingredients, and it can radiate heat well. If it is large, or if it is a pack of many cells, a cooling system has to be installed or a path set up for air to flow through.'"
