"'111','2015-01-22','American Express said on Wednesday that it planned to cut more than 4,000 jobs this year, about 6 percent of its total work force. The New York-based company said the cuts were part of a companywide efficiency drive. The announcement came as it reported an 11 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit. The company will take a $313 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, partly as a result of the cuts. The chief financial officer, Jeffrey C. Campbell, said some of the job cuts would be offset by hiring in other divisions. It last made mass job cuts in 2013, when it cut 5,400 jobs. American Express said it earned $1.45 billion, or $1.39 a share, in the three-month period that ended Dec. 31. That compares with a profit of $1.31 billion, or $1.21 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue net of interest expense was $9.11 billion, compared with $8.55 billion a year ago.

The ban, which was tweaked before being approved, is expected to take effect in about three months. Among the revisions, smokers will not be allowed within five feet of bar entrances, instead of the 25 feet first proposed. Smoking will be allowed in parks. Also exempt from the ban were cigar shops and hookah bars already in existence. Smoking will be allowed, too, at outside areas of bars, restaurants and gambling halls.'"
