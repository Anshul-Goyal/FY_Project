5 2009-01-01 The Bush administration has approved a plan that could allow more than 18,000 natural gas wells to be drilled in southeastern Montana over the next two decades. The decision by C. Stephen Allred, assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Department of Interior, would allow companies to proceed with plans to drill on more than 1.5 million acres of federal land in the remote Powder River Basin. Bureau of Land Management officials say the plan would phase in drilling, meaning it could be halted if environmental problems arose. (AP)
6 2009-01-01 Fitch Ratings on Wednesday said it may cut the short-term issuer ratings and commercial paper ratings for Dow Chemical and Rohm & Haas after Kuwait scrapped a deal to form a $17.4 billion petrochemical joint venture with Dow. The long-term ratings of Dow and Rohm & Haas also remain on review for downgrade from BBB-plus, the third lowest investment grade. Fitch cut Dow’s rating in July and placed both companies on review for downgrade after the acquisition was announced. Dow had intended to finance its acquisition of Rohm & Haas with money from the Kuwaiti joint venture. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service cut Dow’s ratings on Monday and left them on review for further downgrade on the failed venture.
7 2009-01-01 GMAC Financial Services said Wednesday that bondholders representing $21.2 billion of its debt had agreed to the terms of a debt-for-equity swap that was intended to help it raise enough capital to qualify for federal aid.

The results of the exchange offer come a week after the Federal Reserve approved GMAC’s application for bank holding status, making it eligible for a portion of the $700 billion bank rescue package.

GMAC said that bondholders tendered $17.5 billion, or 59 percent, of its GMAC notes, and $3.7 billion, or 39 percent, of its Residential Capital notes. The company had aimed for 75 percent participation on both offers.

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services cut certain debt ratings on Wednesday for both GMAC and ResCap to “selective default” after the deal was announced. It said the debt deal paid less than face value to certain bondholders and devalued the bonds that had not been swapped.

S.& P. said the exchange, along with GMAC’S new bank status, strengthened the troubled company. GMAC, which has been hit this year by the downturns in both the automotive and housing markets, posted losses totaling $5.59 billion for the first three quarters of this year. This week, GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors, received $5 billion in aid from the Treasury Department. In addition, the Treasury said it would lend up to $1 billion to G.M. so that the automaker would be able to buy more equity from GMAC. Those purchases are expected to raise more capital for GMAC.

The participation in the debt swaps fell well short of the level GMAC previously said it needed to met its capital goal of $30 billion. GMAC had said it needed that much in regulatory capital for the Fed to approve its application to become a bank holding company.
8 2009-01-01 Ahh, the first dawn of a new year! A time for resolutions and fresh starts — and probably aspirin to quell the pounding headache you have from the Bacchanalian revelry of New Year’s Eve.

Unfortunately, Steve Jobs and Apple have no solution yet for a hangover, but there is a little Apple-centric device that might have come in handy Wednesday night.

The iBreath, an iPod-iPhone accessory, turns Apple’s devices into a portable Breathalyzer-type gadget. Blow into a flip-out tube on the iBreath and voilà: it estimates your blood-alcohol concentration. The small device, which attaches to the iPhone’s dock connector interface, may not be as accurate as the one the police use, but it’s a good idea to hand over the keys if the iBreath says you’re over the legal driving limit, or edging into headache territory.

The iBreath sells for $79 from DavidSteele.com. Of course, you could always give up alcohol for the coming year, but how likely is that? RUSS JUSKALIAN
9 2009-01-01 It’s not quite a “please don’t read,” but David Rieff comes close in the doleful preface to “Reborn,” the first volume of notebooks by his mother, Susan Sontag, who died in 2004. He refuses to use the classically unprovable “she would have wanted it” to explain his decision to publish them. Alive, she would never have let them appear, he tells us; in fact she might have burned them.

All but visibly wincing, he states that he would rather have left them unpublished. They are raw and unvarnished and perhaps that is a virtue; still, they contain “much that I would have preferred not to know and not to have others know.” Reading her entries, he writes, he felt like the Greek theatergoer who watched Medea about to kill her children, and shouted, “Don’t do it!”

So why does he do it? His answer, in this oddest of editor’s notes  written with touching laconic power  is that Sontag had left her papers without restrictions to the University of California, Los Angeles. If he did not do the job, thus at least keeping some control, someone else would.

A reason to publish, perhaps. Is it a reason to read? In many ways these scrappy entries justify Mr. Rieff’s doubts. It is not because the material is raw, with its accounts of lesbian sex invariably ending in wretchedness, but because the writing is.

For Sontag, to write was as necessary as to breathe, but it was always a labored breathing. She was not spontaneous in her expression; her intellectual ferocity was dressed and belted before it was allowed out. Here the writing is in a dawn disarray. Only very rarely does it manage the prickly splinter of insight  right headed, wrong headed  we associate with her work.

More serious, perhaps, these bits of diary mostly lack what can give value even to the most private and personal examples of the form: inner vision of an outside world. Virtually the only outside we get here, even in Sontag’s accounts of her marriage and two extended affairs, is in the way it affects her feelings. We are not looking through her eyes; we are looking at her eyes, mainly inflamed.

Take her marriage at 17 to Philip Rieff, an academic for whom she did research. There is virtually nothing about him, or about their life together until it falls apart. Instead there are epigrams about the universal oppressiveness of marriage: “It is an institution committed to the dulling of feelings. The whole point of marriage is repetition.”

This set of notebooks (two later volumes are planned) begins in 1947, when she was 14, and runs through 1963, well before the writing that would make her justly famous. They are raggedly kept; some years are skipped or missing, others get no more than a couple of pages.

They are in no way a systematic record, and rarely do they give us much idea of what she was about at any particular time. Mr. Rieff provides very few nuts and bolts, perhaps reflecting his gingerly attitude towards the whole project. This contributes to the feeling that we are getting, at best, not herself and others but emotions about herself and others. “I am not myself with people,” she writes, adding “but am I myself when alone?”

What is most heavily touched on in these early 15 years is Sontag’s exploration of her sexuality. She is briefly ecstatic with her initiation into lesbian sex and the prospect of limitless, commitment-free affairs. No messy love stuff: thus, the “reborn” of the title.

Then despair sets in. A long sadomasochistic subjugation to a woman in Paris, identified only as H, and a subsequent relationship with the playwright Maria Irene Fornes, stormy though less chilling, help her to decide that, on the contrary, sex without love is worthless.

Restless discovery and change: just what a private notebook is for. But these published miseries, endlessly described and feeding interminable doubts about her self-worth, are more than anyone but a psychoanalyst could want to know. At this stage of her life Sontag, as the French say, did not just fit badly inside her skin  she fit badly inside her liver and tonsils as well; everywhere, perhaps, but inside her brain.

Because it is a welcome relief, though too rare, when she rises from her innards to play with a few gleefully aerial ideas. The Marquis de Sade reverses Immanuel Kant in advocating that people be treated not as ends but only as means. The writer goes through four stages: the “nut” (motivated by a generating obsession), then the moron (flailing away without regard to corrective good sense), then the stylist and finally the critic. (The first two are at work here; the others will show up later.)

There is a startling phrase about Kafka, a writer she discovered at 20. “Kafka has that magic of actuality in even the most dislocated phrase that no other modern has, a kind of shiver and grinding blue ache in your teeth.” Has the utter human naturalness of his estranging visions ever been so well conveyed?

At one point Sontag writes: “I live my life as a spectacle for myself, for my own edification. I live my life but I don’t live in it.” There is something of this in the journals: self-absorption and self-absence at the same time. “What remains is pain and ambition,” Mr. Rieff writes.
10 2009-01-01 There was almost no place to hide from the crash of 2008.

When the New York Stock Exchange bell rang out the year on Wednesday, it tolled for virtually anyone with money in the stock market.

The final, grim tally only confirmed what investors had known for months: it was a very bad year to own stocks, any stocks  indeed, one of the worst ever.

In a mere 12 months, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 4,488.43 points, or 33.8 percent, its most punishing loss since 1931. Blue chips like Bank of America, Citigroup and Alcoa lost more than 65 percent of their value. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index sank 39.5 percent, almost exactly matching its decline in 1937.

All told, about $7 trillion of shareholders’ wealth  the gains of the last six years  was wiped out in a year of violent market swings.

But what is striking is not just the magnitude of the declines, staggering as they are, but also their breadth. All but two of the 30 Dow industrials, Wal-Mart and McDonald’s, fell by more than 10 percent. Almost no industry was spared as the crisis that first emerged in the subprime mortgage market metastasized and the economy sank into what could be a long recession.

As the new year dawns, Wall Street is looking to Washington, where the balance of financial power has tipped in recent months. Analysts and investors are focusing on what the incoming Obama administration and the Federal Reserve will do to revive the economy and the financial system.

It is a remarkable turnabout from the mid-1990s, when Wall Street traders helped drive economic policy. Back then, bond investors flexed their financial muscle and urged the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit.

These days, the market in ultra-safe United States Treasury securities seems like a refuge, even as the deficit balloons from the cost of bailing out banks, insurers and the Detroit auto companies. Many investors, having lost stocks and other investments, are buying up Treasuries that offer little or no return. They are content simply to get their money back.

“The only willing risk taker is the government,” said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the giant bond trading firm. Speaking of the epicenter of the financial world, he added: “It is no longer New York, it’s Washington.”

Like many money managers, Mr. Gross is a conservative  he describes himself as a “Reagan fan from way back”  who generally prefers limited government involvement in the markets. But he and others say that the government’s sweeping intervention into private industry and in the markets, though sometimes flawed, is necessary to prevent a collapse of the financial system. They are hoping that policy makers do even more to stimulate the economy and revive moribund financial markets.

Given the damage in the markets, however, policy makers face daunting challenges.

“When we have bear markets, they usually take twice as long to get down this far,” said Robert C. Doll, vice chairman of BlackRock, the big investment firm.

The markets have become incredibly volatile, especially since Lehman Brothers sank into bankruptcy in September. Since then, the S.& P. has moved more than 5 percent in either direction on 18 days. There were only 17 such days in the previous 53 years, according to calculations by Howard Silverblatt, an index analyst at S.& P.

Diversification  the idea that it is unwise to put all your eggs in one basket  did not pay off for investors in 2008, casting doubt over this cornerstone of modern investing. The American market was far from the worst hit in 2008. Stocks fell 55 to 72 percent in the so-called BRIC economies  Brazil, Russia, India and China  that were darlings of the late, great boom. Stocks in developed European and Asian markets also fell sharply, though less than their emerging counterparts. Many commodities like oil and copper crashed.

Losses in the credit markets, which are at the heart of this financial crisis, appear small relative to the devastation in other markets. The International Monetary Fund estimated in October that banks and other investors would suffer $1.4 trillion in losses on loans and securities, a loss of just 6 percent. Financial institutions globally have already reported $1 trillion in write-downs, according to Bloomberg.

The I.M.F.’s estimate, however, does not count losses on derivatives, those complex instruments that derive their value from other assets. Losses on these instruments could outstrip those in the so-called cash markets because they are much bigger than their underlying assets.

A spokeswoman for the I.M.F. said the fund’s estimates did not include those losses because they were transfers of wealth from one party of a transaction to another. For example, when the insurer American International Group loses $1 billion on a credit-default swap, a type of derivative, it makes payments to customers like investment banks.

These complex financial instruments will pose one of the biggest challenges to policy makers in the year ahead. Many investors have lost confidence in banks, insurers and other financial intermediaries, in part because they do not know whether these companies are valuing opaque instruments properly. Some firms may be carrying enough toxic sludge to sink them, while others may be relatively unscathed.

“Until those assets can be removed from the balance sheets of the bank, or until the owners get a better understanding of what these assets are worth, we will have uncertainty,” said Douglas M. Peta, an independent market analyst.

A broader focus for policy makers will be reviving the economy. Most financial and political analysts expect the Obama administration to enact a stimulus package that could approach $1 trillion. The effort will aim to create three million jobs by spending money on infrastructure, green energy technology, aid to states and other initiatives.
11 2009-01-01 Mr. Shahristani said he hoped the contracts in the second round would be signed by the end of 2009. He also said the ministry was planning to announce more licensing auctions in the future.

The ministry has come under criticism for the slow pace of Iraq’s oil production. Although the country sits on one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world, roughly 115 billion barrels, security and infrastructure problems have left them largely untapped.

Iraq is producing far below its capacity, Mr. Shahristani acknowledged at the news conference, but he said opening these fields for development was meant to address that.

“There are about 78 oil and gas fields in Iraq, but only 15 of them are under operation,” he said.

Plunging oil prices around the world have hurt Iraq’s revenues as well; Iraq’s oil is being sold for around $38 a barrel, a ministry official said, down nearly 70 percent from its high for 2008.

One of the other main events of Wednesday was to be the start of the trial of Muntader al-Zaidi, the Iraqi reporter who was arrested for throwing his shoes at President Bush during a news conference two and a half weeks ago.

But Abdulsattar al-Berikdar, a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, said the trial had been postponed because Mr. Zaidi’s lawyer had filed an appeal.

In a phone interview, Dheyaa Saadi, the lawyer, said the appeal’s purpose was to reduce the charge against Mr. Zaidi so that the case could be taken outside the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court of Iraq, which specializes in terrorism and other serious cases. A higher court will rule on the appeal.

Though recent statistics report that there were fewer civilian deaths in Iraq in 2008 than in any other year since the 2003 invasion, violence continues to buffet the volatile provinces of Nineveh and Diyala.

Two bombs exploded Wednesday in Mosul, the capital of Nineveh, killing 4 and wounding 20, a local security official said. The target of the first was a police patrol, and the second exploded shortly afterward, as bystanders gathered.

A candidate for the coming provincial elections was killed by unidentified gunmen on a major street in Mosul, a police official said. One policeman died in a gunfight with the attackers as they escaped.

The candidate, Mowaffaq al-Hamdani, was a Sunni Arab. The elections in Nineveh are seen as crucial for the Sunnis. Many of them boycotted the last election, leaving a provincial council dominated by a Kurdish bloc.

A car bomb exploded near a public market in Sinjar, a town in Nineveh near the Syrian border, killing 3 and wounding 35. The Kurds maintain a tight control of Sinjar, which they view as belonging to Kurdistan, a situation that has raised tensions with Sunni Arabs who live in the volatile, poverty-stricken towns to the south.

In Diyala, a bomb, its target an army patrol, exploded near Khanaqin, another area that has been involved in a tense standoff between Kurds and Arabs. Two were killed in the attack, including an officer, and two others were wounded, a security official said.
12 2009-01-01 Oil prices rebounded from a sharp drop Wednesday and moved higher after the latest government report showed a smaller-than-expected gain in fuel stockpiles in the United States.

The trading came a day before the OPEC cartel planned to cut production by another 2.2 million barrels a day, its latest attempt to shore up the plummeting price. The price of light, sweet crude in New York was up 5 cents a barrel to $39.04 a barrel.

The weekly report by the Energy Information Administration showed that the inventory of commercial crude oil stocks rose 500,000 barrels to 318.7 million barrels in the week to Dec. 26. Stocks were expected to be down 1.5 million barrels.

Prices had been down more than a dollar a barrel earlier Wednesday as investors seemed to be skeptical about pledges from Kuwait, Iran and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stick with new quotas, after having ignored previous production cuts.

“The market seemed to be building in a lot of skepticism that OPEC would not adhere to the quotas that they agreed on,” said Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas. “The reality is that demand is down so much that there’s a good possibility that OPEC could surprise and actually come closer to meeting their agreed upon cuts.”
13 2009-01-01 SHANGHAI  A court in southern China convicted 11 people on Wednesday of violating national copyright laws and participating in a sophisticated counterfeiting ring that for years manufactured and distributed pirated Microsoft software throughout the world.

The men were sentenced by a court in the city of Shenzhen to terms of 18 months to six and a half years in prison, according to court papers released late Wednesday.

Microsoft applauded the sentence in a statement released late Wednesday Beijing time, saying they were the stiffest sentences ever handed down in this type of Chinese copyright infringement case.

Microsoft has called the group part of “the biggest software counterfeiting organization we have ever seen, by far” and estimated its global sales at more than $2 billion.

Some legal specialists consider the case to be a landmark because it involved a joint antipiracy effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. Law enforcement officials said it was also notable because the group operated like a multinational corporation, producing and distributing high-quality counterfeit software that was created and packaged almost identically to the real products, despite Microsoft’s antipiracy measures.

The counterfeit goods, like Windows XP and Office 2007, were sold over the Internet and shipped from China, mostly to the United States and Europe, where they commanded relatively high prices, investigators say. American and Chinese officials say they broke up the criminal ring in July 2007 with the arrest of 25 people in China, the dismantling of several manufacturing facilities and the confiscation of counterfeit software valued at more than $500 million.

“This is absolutely unprecedented,” David Finn, Microsoft’s associate general counsel for worldwide piracy and counterfeiting issues, said. “The size and scope of the operation is unlike anything we’ve seen before. We found their products in 36 countries.”

A separate trial involving nine suspects in Shanghai has not yet reached a verdict. That group has been accused of counterfeiting Microsoft and Symantec software and distributing it worldwide.

Legal specialists say that software pirates are becoming increasingly sophisticated and that the two court cases show that China is capable of exporting high-quality, fully packaged software that could easily be sold as if it were the real thing. Even customs officials have been fooled by the counterfeits, which contained hologram markings and Microsoft’s difficult-to-replicate “certificates of authenticity,” investigators say.

Counterfeiting experts say the ring appeared to be less interested in selling its products inside China, where counterfeit Microsoft software can be purchased for as little as $3. It sought the higher-value export market.

Microsoft said its 75-member antipiracy team had been tracking the ring since 2001. The F.B.I. began its operation, code-named Summer Solstice, in 2005 and cooperated with Chinese officials.

American politicians and corporate executives have been pressing China for years to crack down on piracy and intellectual property rights abuses that included music, film and expensive software products. Software piracy is rampant in China, where about 80 percent of computers are believed to use counterfeit software, according to the Business Software Alliance.

The counterfeiting has caused some friction between American and Chinese officials, but China insists that it has made significant progress in its fight against intellectual property violators. The successful prosecution of one of the biggest software counterfeiting rings is seen by the government as a major breakthrough.

Shenzhen officials declined to comment Wednesday on the court verdict. While the F.B.I. and Chinese officials say hundreds of millions of dollars worth of material were seized in a variety of international raids, the Shenzhen court found on Wednesday that the suspects on trial there had sold less than $200,000 worth of counterfeit products overseas.

It is unclear whether others pocketed much greater sums or whether many more ringleaders are still at large.

Most of those convicted Wednesday had completed only middle school, according to court documents. But members of the group had access to one of China’s biggest disk manufacturing companies in Shenzhen through the use of fake licenses, court papers said.

The counterfeit Microsoft software was produced using manufacturing equipment that costs millions of dollars, investigators said, and appeared in English, German, Italian, Korean, Spanish as well as other languages. The Chinese government found warehouses filled with molding machines, gilding machines, sealing machines and air compressors.

3. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the onion. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and very tender. Stir often. Add the ground cumin and stir together for about 30 seconds, then stir into the lentils and bulgur.

4. Moisten your hands with water and knead the mixture in the bowl for 3 to 5 minutes. Each time it begins to stick to your hands, moisten them again, and this will moisten the mixture. If it seems very dry and crumbly, add a tablespoon of water. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 cup of the minced parsley, and for a spicier mixture add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper. Taste and adjust salt.

5. Moisten your hands and shape the mixture into walnut-size balls (about 1 inch). You’ll have to moisten your hands again whenever the mixture begins to stick to them. Place on a platter and sprinkle with the remaining parsley. Garnish with scallions, romaine lettuce leaves and lemon wedges, and serve, or chill for several hours. Serve cold or at room temperature.

20 2009-01-02 Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson and tight end Antonio Gates missed a second straight practice as San Diego continued to prepare for its home wild-card playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday night.

It sounds as if Tomlinson, who has a strained groin, is in better shape than Gates, who has a sprained ankle.

“If we were playing today he probably wouldn’t play,” Coach Norv Turner said about Gates, a Pro Bowl tight end.

And Tomlinson? “Yeah, I think he would,” Turner said.

“Both of them are a lot better than they have been,” Turner said. “It really will be a Saturday decision, how they feel.”

Tomlinson said he felt better than he did on Sunday night, when he was hurt in San Diego’s 52-21 victory against Denver that clinched the A.F.C. West for the Chargers (8-8).

“I hope to play, but ultimately it’s not really my decision,” Tomlinson said. Tomlinson had his first three-touchdown game of the season Sunday night. With 1,110 yards rushing, he had the worst season of his eight-year career.
21 2009-01-02 Baltimore’s police commissioner helped make New Year’s Eve arrests of two men who he said had fired illegal guns into the air. The commissioner, Frederick H. Bealefeld III, had planned to end the year at a New Year’s Eve fireworks celebration in the Inner Harbor. But after it was canceled by strong winds, he spent the night on patrol in a violent section of west Baltimore. When he and an aide spotted two men firing shotguns in the air, they chased the suspects into a home. The commissioner followed one of the men into a basement, where he encountered several more people. He held them at gunpoint while calling for backup. Both gunmen were arrested, and officers seized the illegal 12-gauge sawed-off shotguns. Celebratory gunfire is common in Baltimore on New Year’s Eve, and officers made 44 arrests between midnight and 3 a.m. and seized about four dozen guns, the police said.
22 2009-01-02 Crude oil prices were lower and gold prices rose as trading resumed after the New Year holiday.

Crude oil prices fell in New York, extending their worst yearly drop, on concern that a global economic contraction would limit fuel demand.

Crude oil for February delivery dropped as much as $2.06, or 4.6 percent, to $42.54 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Gold rose in Asia after an eighth straight annual gain as demand increased for the metal as a hedge against inflation and an alternative asset.

Gold advanced 5.8 percent in 2008 on demand for a store of value, as a financial crisis pushed major economies into recession and drove equity markets lower.

Bullion for immediate delivery gained $2.10 an ounce to $881.55 at 9 a.m. in Singapore, after earlier rising as much as 1 percent to $888.35. Gold for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to $882.40 in after-hours electronic trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
23 2009-01-02 The Credit Suisse Group, the Swiss bank, agreed to sell a stake in its global investors business to Aberdeen Asset Management for 250 million British pounds ($361 million) in stock after losses at the unit. The stake includes assets under management of about 75 billion Swiss francs ($71 billion) and divisions in Europe, the United States and Asia, Credit Suisse said. Credit Suisse, which is based in Zurich, will receive a stake of almost 25 percent in the Aberdeen Asset Management firm and a seat on its board. The sale “enables us to focus our resources on alternative investments, asset allocation and Swiss businesses,” said Rob Shafir, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse’s asset management unit.
24 2009-01-02 The bags of milk powder represent a startling reversal of fortune for the dairy industry, which flourished in recent years in part because of a growing appetite for milk, cheese, ice cream and pizza in places like Mexico, Egypt and Indonesia. Many of those countries were benefiting from a global economic boom led by free-spending consumers in the United States.

As American dairy farmers increased their shipments of powdered milk, cheese and other dairy ingredients to foreign markets, their incomes rose. And the demand surge helped drive up the price of milk for American families. The national average for whole milk peaked at $3.89 a gallon in July, up from an average of $3.20 a gallon in 2006.

But now, demand for dairy products is stalling amid a global economic slowdown and credit crisis, even as supplies have increased. The result is a glut of milk — and its assorted byproducts, like milk powder, butter and whey proteins — that has led to a precipitous drop in prices.

The price of powdered skim milk, used in infant formula, dairy products and processed foods, has fallen to roughly 80 cents a pound today from about $2.20 in mid-2007. Other dairy products have declined as well. Whole milk at grocers has not declined as rapidly as wholesale powdered milk, but it has dropped to $3.67 a gallon, down nearly 6 percent from the peak.

While consumers are undoubtedly pleased by the lower prices, dairy farmers are struggling.

“Everything was going great,” said Joaquin Contente, a farmer in Hanford, Calif. “The product was moving. Then this financial crisis came along and shoot, the whole thing came to a halt.”

Logic might suggest that dairy farmers would simply sell some of their cows to a hamburger plant to cut the milk supply and raise prices. Indeed, the dairy industry has a cooperative effort under way to cull the herd.

But farmers are reluctant to do that if they expect a demand recovery, since rebuilding a herd can take years. The culling program is relatively small, and at least so far, most farmers are holding onto their cows.

“People don’t want to panic,” said Brian W. Gould, an agricultural economist at the University of Wisconsin, adding that farmers were receiving $20 for 100 pounds of raw milk just a few months ago. The price is expected to drop to about $14 for 100 pounds of raw milk in coming months. “It is unclear as to whether this will be a short-term or long-term market correction. It all depends on how long it takes the U.S. economy to recover,” he said.

Other agricultural sectors are also struggling with a slowdown in demand from foreign buyers because of the global recession and an increase in the value of the dollar, which has made American exports more expensive abroad. The Agriculture Department is expecting steep declines in exports of corn, wheat, soybeans and pork.

But while the government has price-support programs for about two dozen agricultural products, so far milk powder is the only commodity that has sunk low enough to start the flow of government dollars. Some expect that taxpayers will soon be buying blocks of cheese, too, given the plunging price.

Government price supports provide a price floor for agricultural products as a way of keeping farmers afloat during hard times and ensuring an adequate food supply.

The Agriculture Department has committed to buying 111.6 million pounds of milk powder at 80 cents a pound, for roughly $91 million, which includes some handling fees. Before October, the last time the government bought milk powder was in June 2006, and it was eventually used in government nutrition programs, given away as animal feed or sold on the open market, said Steve Gill, director of commodity operations for the department.

He said the agency has not decided what to do with the cache of milk powder in California.

Some critics of farm subsidies argue that price support programs are antiquated and allow farmers to continue producing even when the economics make no sense, as taxpayers will always buy up the excess production.

“They don’t want to downsize or respond to the market signal. They want to keep producing,” said Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research organization that has long been critical of the government’s farm policy. “Once you get in a jam like this, it becomes our collective problem.”

The government purchases come after what the department calls a “euphoric period of record prices and booming exports” for the American dairy industry. Since 2003, dairy exports have increased from $1 billion a year to about $4 billion this year, with exports of powdered milk increasing sixfold during that period. Milk powder is an attractive product to export because it does not require refrigeration, has a long shelf life and can be used to make numerous beverages and foods.

Much of the increase was caused by increased demand in developing countries, where a growing middle class replaced starch in their diets with protein sources like meat and dairy products. Some Asian countries had little history of eating dairy products but were introduced to milk and mild cheeses by government nutrition programs or by restaurant chains like McDonald’s and Pizza Hut.

In China, for instance, per-person dairy consumption nearly doubled in just five years, to 63 pounds in 2007 from 33 pounds in 2002 (though it remains far below the per-capita consumption in the United States of about 580 pounds), according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council. The growth translates into the need for nearly 40 billion pounds more milk each year, roughly equal to California’s annual milk production.

In addition to the increased demand, exports from the American dairy industry benefited from a relatively weak dollar and tight global supplies. For instance, droughts reduced milk production in New Zealand and Australia, two major dairy exporters, allowing American suppliers to fill the gaps.

American dairy shipments soared to places like Algeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines. The biggest market, however, was Mexico, where imports from America increased to $853 million in 2007 from $258 million in 2003, according to the Agriculture Department.

But now, global demand has stagnated amid high prices and economic uncertainty just as the dollar has strengthened and milk production in New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, Australia, has bounced back. The continuing scandal involving melamine contamination of dairy products in China is expected to further diminish demand.

“In some of these countries where dairy hasn’t been a big part of their diet, this is where we are seeing people pull back,” said Deborah Perkins, managing director of the food and agribusiness research group at Rabobank International.

Several dairy exporters say they remain bullish on their long-term prospects, given the barely tapped markets in the developing world. Until then, dairy farmers say, they are braced for a period of low milk prices even as feed and other costs remain relatively high.

Arthur Machado, who milks cows on the outskirts of Fresno, said he sold more than half his herd in 2006, the last time prices collapsed. Now, with prices plummeting again, he said he is trying to sell the remainder of his herd to another dairy farmer.

“The business isn’t what it was in the ’70s, when I started,” he said. “There are not enough peaks to offset the valleys anymore.”

Once the herd is sold, Mr. Machado said, he plans to focus on less volatile commodities, like almonds and grapes. But it is not so easy to get out of the dairy business. Just as with automobiles and homes, there is simply too much inventory on the dairy cow market.

“Right now, there are no buyers,” he said. “When it’s on the upswing, we’ll sell. Until then, we’ll struggle through.”
25 2009-01-02 LyondellBasell Industries, a chemicals maker controlled by the investor Len Blavatnik, may file for bankruptcy as a way to restructure debt that financed its $12.7 billion merger a year ago.

The company hired an executive to oversee a restructuring in case it seeks court protection and said its private equity owners had denied a request for a loan, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday.

“We’re exploring all of our options,” Susan Moore, a spokeswoman for the company, said on Wednesday. “Filing Chapter 11 is one of those options.”

The chemicals maker is struggling with a collapse in home and auto sales that has depressed demand for things as diverse as car bumpers and paint. LyondellBasell’s lenders face losses of more than 90 cents on the dollar as it joins Harrah’s Entertainment, the Realogy Corporation and GMAC in seeking to restructure the debt-fueled buyouts of the last two years.

“These companies had the bad luck to add sizable amounts of leverage at the peak of the cycle,” said Christopher Garman, chief executive officer of Garman Research in Orinda, Calif.
26 2009-01-02 The artifacts are surrounded with photos and clips from family home movies. One 1888 photo, of the 6-year-old Franklin in a sailor suit at the helm of his father’s yacht, is displayed not far from a sketch of a sailboat, not at all bad, that Franklin drew at 5.

Photographs taken during his presidency record both historic events (Roosevelt meeting Winston Churchill on H.M.S. Prince of Wales during the August 1941 Atlantic Charter meeting in the North Atlantic) and poignant moments: the president at the wheel of a sloop, Amberjack II, in June 1933, en route from Massachusetts to his family’s summer home on Campobello Island off the coast of Maine. (What did he do after his first 100 days in office, exhausted from trying to solve the country’s great financial crisis? He went sailing.)

“Despite the fact that in 1921 polio left Roosevelt unable to walk or even stand on his own, it did not keep him from his first love — the sea,” Robert F. Cross, an authority on Roosevelt’s naval history, writes in the fall issue of Seaport magazine, published by the museum. “After 1921, being at the helm of a sailboat was really the only circumstance in which FDR’s disability was irrelevant.”

Roosevelt, whose ancestors included whalers, shipbuilders and sea captains, acquired ephemera documenting his family’s history at sea.

An 1862 ship log from the clipper Surprise, for example, lists Roosevelt’s maternal grandmother, Catherine Robbins Lyman Delano and six of her children (including Roosevelt’s mother, Sara), as passengers on the trip from New York to Hong Kong. Roosevelt’s maternal grandfather, Warren Delano II, made a fortune trading in tea and opium in China, and the family lived there for years. That business was the foundation of the family’s wealth.

Other ship models include Pardon Me, a wooden speedboat made by a prison inmate as a gift, and France, a model submarine Charles de Gaulle gave him in 1944. The president promptly tested the sub in the Washington boat basin, watching with delight as it submerged and launched torpedoes.

Christie’s Jan. 21 sale of Chinese export porcelain has a rare set of six plates that satirize the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720, a financial disaster with clear parallels to the present.

“When the company collapsed, governments were almost ruined, and the English had to step in and restore the banking system,” said Becky MacGuire, the porcelain specialist at Christie’s.

The South Sea Company, despite its name, was an English enterprise trying to mine gold in South America — without any success. It attracted speculators from all over Europe.

“Company stock traded at £128 in January 1720 before reaching £550 in May and peaking at £1,050 in late June, when the sell-off began,” reads the entry in Christie’s catalog. “By August individuals and institutions alike had been destroyed.”

Chinese potters copied prints from Europe on the plates that depict buffoonlike Harlequin figures from the popular commedia dell’arte.

“Instead of New Yorker cartoons, they had plates to satirize the high and mighty,” Ms. MacGuire said. The estimate for the set is $40,000 to $60,000.

There’s still time to catch the intriguing exhibition about the most revered fall flower of Japan. “The Chrysanthemum in Japanese Art,” at the LuEsther T. Mertz Library of the New York Botanical Garden, in on view through Jan. 11.

With only 32 objects, the show explores how artists have portrayed the kiku, or chrysanthemum, the emblem of the Japanese imperial family, over four centuries in woodcut prints, hanging scroll paintings, screens, ceramics, metalwork and textiles.

The flower became a symbol of longevity after the Japanese adopted the Chinese legend of the Chrysanthemum Boy, a youth banished from the Chinese Imperial court who attains a long life in exile by drinking the dew from mums in the mountains.

The exiled boy is beautifully depicted on hanging scrolls, but the legend is also alluded to in simple designs depicting only dipper, stream and chrysanthemum — variations that are well explained in the excellent catalog by the curators Miyeko Murase and Stephanie Wada.
27 2009-01-02 Mr. Florke, who has several other businesses, can afford to be sanguine. But for many in the Catskills, this is a tough winter.

“Buyers think everything should be a fire sale,” said David Knudsen, a broker at the Catskills Buyer Agency in Liberty, who said the average sale prices declined more than 15 percent from November 2007 to November 2008. At the same time, by all accounts, the number of closings has declined substantially.

The tightened credit market is part of the problem. But even those buyers who can get financing are playing wait-and-see. “They don’t have one iota of motivation to do anything,” Mr. Knudsen said, because they think both prices and interest rates are going lower.

At the same time, Mr. Knudsen said, “many sellers are in la-la land,” unwilling to recognize how low buyers expect prices to go.

And that — the expectations gap — means houses aren’t selling.

In early October, in his Catskills real estate blog, blog.catskill4sale.com, he called the situation an “economic Armageddon.”

A few weeks later, Sullivan County’s largest brokerage, Yeager Realty, with 40 agents in Liberty, Bethel and Rock Hill, shuttered its offices, after a 24-year run. (The company’s owner, Paula Yeager, said she would continue to work from home.) .

Indeed, with so many fewer serious buyers, Mr. Knudsen said, he thought the best advice to some sellers was to close up their houses for the winter, rather than keep them open for the occasional — very occasional — showing.

“If they want to come up for a weekend, they can stay in a motel,” he said. It’s cheaper, he said, than heating the house all winter.

True, Ronny Murphy, a broker at Coldwell Banker Currier Lazier, in Rock Hill, said she has sold a few places recently — one, in Fremont, was reduced to $205,000 from $300,000 — and that she had a “quite a few” people looking in December. Some of them figure “real estate is a better place to put their money than the stock market,” she said.

At the same time, Ms. Murphy said, a number of sellers have taken their houses off the market, because the Multiple Listing Service reports how long they’ve been for sale, and they don’t want the listings to say “one year.” They’ll put them back on the market, as fresh listings, in the spring, she said.

Mr. Florke said that he had an offer on his own house, but the buyer needed financing, which required an appraisal. And the appraiser said he couldn’t come up with comparables, because there hadn’t been any sales nearby in several months.

Homeowners who haven’t been able to sell include Mark and Lisa Hellman, who own a large farmhouse on a spectacular site in Youngsville. After buying the place for $275,000 in 2004, they put $500,000 more into a gut renovation. “I got my dream kitchen,” said Ms. Hellman, surveying her six-burner Viking range and Sub-Zero refrigerator, amid a sea of tasteful cabinetry. The entire house is ready for the cover of a magazine, thanks to the decorating efforts of Ms. Hellman (who is an executive of the fashion house Versace).

But the Hellmans — who have two small children and are considering exchanging their city and country homes for a single suburban residence — put the house on the market in mid-2007. At the time, they were asking $1.2 million. Soon they had an offer for $1 million, which they rejected as too low.

Now their asking price is $985,000, and still no one has looked in months, said Mr. Hellman, an executive of his family’s building maintenance company, Temco Service Industries. That may reflect a particular softness at the high end of the market, Mr. Knudsen and other brokers said.

But the Hellmans have something in common with many people offering houses in the Catskills: they don’t need to sell.

“You don’t see a lot of distressed sellers up here,” said Dorothy McArdle, the owner of Apple Tree Realty, in Andes (a small town in Delaware County). People who bought second homes in the Catskills, she said, have tended to buy places they could afford, and to make large down payments. “You don’t see the high loan-to-value ratio” that is causing problems in other areas, she said.

The owner of a house on a pond in Andes recently lowered the price to $299,000 from $329,000, said Ms. McArdle, who is listing it. She said she had seen “some reductions more drastic than that, but in those cases the original asking prices were inflated to begin with.”

Having sold real estate in Andes for 30 years, Ms. McArdle said she remained “optimistic about the market.

“Right now, people are scared. We need to get through the inauguration, through the winter. At the end of March, the beginning of April, we’ll see an increase in activity.”

But at what prices? Mr. Knudsen said the Catskills were seeing “a move to moderation.” He said that in 2007 “the sweet spot in the second-home market” — where a mid-range New York City buyer would be looking — was around $325,000. “That would have bought a chalet-style house,” he said, “with wood floors, cathedral ceiling, three bedrooms, two bathrooms — a really nice getaway.”

A year later, he said, buyers expect to pay about $100,000 less. “The buyer that I’m seeing in what I call the mid-range — employed, not wealthy, the middle-class urban buyer, looking for a getaway — is looking in the mid-200s. But I don’t know that their expectations have necessarily shrunk as fast as their budgets.”

Some of the biggest bargains may be not in homes, but in homesites. In mid-2007, Redstone Properties, a national developer of subdivisions, began marketing lots in Bethel, in Sullivan County. The lots were priced at $149,900 and up. Some of those same lots, which range from 4 to 10 acres, are now available for as little as $69,900, according to Toby Potterton, the sales manager for the development, the Highlands at Bethel. He said that the company was actually bullish, and that it wanted to sell the land so it could use the money for larger projects.

Undeveloped land isn’t the only real estate available for under $100,000. When a neighbor asked Mr. Florke to list his house — a cute cabin with an unfinished interior — Mr. Florke decided to price it at $85,000, making it his least expensive listing in years. (In 2007, he would have asked almost twice as much, he said.)

“Everyone asks, ‘Are we at the bottom?’ ” Mr. Florke said. His answer: “I don’t know, but there are some great deals out there.”

Indeed, he said, “this may become one of those periods that people look back on with nostalgia, talking about the bargains they were able to pick up.”

32 2009-01-03 Ms. Kennedy’s endorsement of Mr. Obama was a significant moment in the Democratic presidential primary and his affection for her seems genuine; he recently called her “one of my dearest friends.” Yet it is hard to calculate the size of his debt to Ms. Kennedy, or where it ranks among his many other obligations, from preventing a conflagration in the Middle East to passing a national economic stimulus package.

Moreover, New York’s senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, is no slouch when it comes to delivering for his New York constituents. And some say it is difficult to imagine Mr. Obama somehow punishing Mr. Paterson or New York, fiscally or otherwise, if the Senate job goes to someone else.

“That’s inconceivable,” said Judith Hope, the former state Democratic Party chairwoman. “It would not be in his self-interest,” she said of Mr. Obama.

Another advantage to picking Ms. Kennedy — or so it seemed a few weeks ago — was that she might allow Mr. Paterson to avoid alienating his many friends and allies who want the job, like Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, and Representative Steve Israel, from Suffolk County. Nobody, the thinking went, could challenge Mr. Paterson for selecting a potential political star.

But Ms. Kennedy, by almost every account, has stumbled a bit during her entrance onto the New York political stage. Mr. Paterson would not be immune from upset, even among allies, were he to go ahead and appoint her.

“She was an out,” said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. “But the initial few salvos did not go her way.”

What is foremost on Mr. Paterson’s mind, some say, is how his Senate appointment will affect the 2010 campaign. Given an array of qualified candidates, they say, Mr. Paterson will focus on who can hold onto the seat and whose presence on the ticket would most help him.

“You would hope that in the 2010 campaign, the aura from her reflects on him and helps him defeat a primary challenge and win a general,” said George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant, who is close to another official interested in the Senate seat, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney.

Given the tens of millions of dollars it could take to hold the seat in 2010 and 2012, money is a major concern. Ms. Kennedy, perhaps alone among the candidates for the job, could tap a national donor network — from Park Avenue to Beverly Hills — to raise money. With that reach, she would compete less against Mr. Paterson and other officials for the real estate and financial industry dollars that fuel statewide campaigns in New York.

Ticket balance is also a consideration. Some of Mr. Paterson’s advisers envision a Republican ticket headed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, for governor, with Joanne M. Mahoney, the popular Onondaga County executive, as his running mate. Rounding out the ticket might be John J. Faso, the former assemblyman, for comptroller, and Peter T. King, the Long Island Republican, for Senate.

“That’s a white Catholic ticket,” said one person who has ties to the governor’s political team, and who requested anonymity for fear of losing those ties. “And it’s white Catholics upstate they are going to lose.”

According to the tribal logic of New York politics, Mr. Paterson can expect strong support in New York City, among black voters and from staunch Democrats. Ms. Kennedy, a white Catholic, could help in the battleground suburbs of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse. But the Democratic ticket already includes Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who is Catholic and already broadly popular in those places.

Picking Ms. Kennedy might assuage some number of women who feel that the seat, currently held by Hillary Rodham Clinton, should be filled by another woman. And Ms. Kennedy would certainly add balance to a ticket that is otherwise all men.

But so could other candidates, including Ms. Maloney and Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who represents a large, mostly rural upstate district along New York’s eastern border. There is no evidence yet that women voters have any particular affinity for Ms. Kennedy over other women up for the seat. Moreover, Mr. Paterson will have another chance to balance the 2010 ticket, when he picks his running mate for lieutenant governor.

Of course, every other candidate has drawbacks. Picking Mr. Cuomo could lead to a fight with the Legislature, which would appoint the new attorney general. Picking Ms. Gillibrand would anger her more senior colleagues. Choosing Ms. Maloney would add yet another Manhattanite to the ticket; Mr. Suozzi yet another Italian-American; Mr. Israel yet another Long Islander.

“The risk is in what he does,” Mr. Miringoff said of the governor. “Not picking her is one thing. But if he then picks someone who most of New York voters say ‘Who?’ — that will need some quick explanation.”
33 2009-01-03 Ole Miss is not just the team that handed Florida its only loss. The Rebels are also on the rise.

Behind Jevan Snead’s passing, Dexter McCluster’s squirming runs and some big returns by Marshay Green, No. 20 Mississippi overcame an early deficit and beat No. 7 Texas Tech, 47-34, on Friday in the final Cotton Bowl played in the Dallas stadium of the same name.

The Red Raiders (11-2) converted two early turnovers into a 14-0 lead, but Snead led the Rebels to touchdowns on their next three drives, followed by a go-ahead field goal shortly before halftime. Once Green returned an interception 65 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter, Ole Miss (9-4) was well on its way to capping Coach Houston Nutt’s first season in grand style.

This was Mississippi’s sixth straight victory, matching its longest streak since 2003, when Eli Manning was a senior. That was also the last time the Rebels had been to a bowl.

“These guys have such great character and it’s gotten better each and every week,” Nutt said.

Texas Tech quarterback Graham Harrell threw two touchdown passes to set the N.C.A.A. career record with 132. He broke the record of 131 set by Colt Brennan of Hawaii from 2005-7.

Mississippi fans broke into chants of "S-E-C! S-E-C!" three times in the closing minutes. A little louder and the cheer might have been heard at the Big 12 offices a few miles away. Still, the message that Mississippi, the fourth-best team in the Southeastern Conference, according to the polls, is better than Texas Tech, the third-best in the Big 12, came across loud and clear. On Thursday, No. 1 Florida of the SEC and No. 2 Oklahoma of the Big 12 will meet for the national title.
34 2009-01-03 Two units of the E*Trade Financial Corporation were fined a total of $1 million for failing to have proper procedures to detect trades that might be used to launder money, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said. From January 2003 to May 2007, the authority said, the units, E*Trade Securities and E*Trade Clearing, failed to provide necessary automated tools to detect suspicious trading activity. It also said the two units relied too heavily on employees to manually monitor for such problems, while processing more than 110,000 trades a day with “little or no” human intervention. E*Trade did not admit wrongdoing but consented to the authority’s findings, it said.
35 2009-01-03 Q. Who do you regard as your main competition and why?

A. Today it’s anybody that fills a prescription, and that can be retail, it can be mail order or Internet pharmacies.

Q. How has the downturn affected your expansion plans?

A. We are slowing store growth from a 9 percent square footage growth in fiscal 2008 to 5 percent in 2011. It allows us to put about a half-billion dollars of capital expenditures back into the stores or other strategic opportunities.

Q. Several years ago, senior citizens were arranging tours to Canada to buy drugs. With the recession, can we expect to see a resurgence of that phenomenon and might it spread to other segments of the population?

A. Since then, we’ve had a Medicare part D benefit rolled out to seniors. In most cases, the seniors that have a part D benefit will have generic co-pays of $5 and many plans have free generic benefit design. We recently released a prescription savings club card targeted for the uninsured and underinsured with complete discounts on over 5,000 prescriptions with 400 generics at $1 a week. We have well over a million members on our card.

Q. Your company is introducing a pharmacy system in Florida that you say will remove much of the routine of filling a prescription. How does it work?

A. This approach to filling prescriptions transfers the data entry, insurance adjudication, follow-up with doctors’ offices and other administrative work out to a central processing facility. It also moves the actual filling of prescription refills to the central facility. The patient will still drop off and pick up their prescriptions at the retail pharmacy. It lowers the cost of filling prescriptions to keep us competitive with other retail and mail pharmacy providers.

Q. Your company has created more than 600 in-store clinics and work site health centers. What’s the importance of the centers? On a work site, what steps have you taken to protect worker privacy?

A. There are millions of Americans going to emergency rooms for care for common ailments we’re able to treat in our clinics. We feel there’s a huge cost reduction available to treat those types of conditions. We feel there’s opportunity to be a big part of this nation’s health care solution by providing nurse practitioners in our retail stores.

Employers across the country are looking for ways to lower their health care costs and deliver better employee benefits. This is a way for an employer to do both. The employer has absolutely no access to the patient records that we care for on their campus. We’re looking to have 800 retail and employer retail clinics open by the end of calendar year 2009.

Q. You have made a decision to enter the area of specialty pharmaceuticals. Why did you decide to pursue this strategy? How will this change the configuration of the pharmacy counter?

A. Complex high-cost drug therapy, such as injectables and infusions, are close to a $70 billion sector. It’s where pharmacy is going, and we want to make sure we participate and make pharmacy services available for our patients. I don’t think you’ll see an actual change in the drugstore. If a patient comes into a pharmacy and has a prescription for an injectable or infused product, we’ll be able to take that prescription, scan it in and send the injectable to the patient’s home or a drugstore or refer them to one of our home infusion facilities for therapy.

Q. What is hiring like for pharmacists in a period of escalating unemployment?

A. There’s been a shortage of pharmacists for probably about the last decade; not as harsh today as it was probably a few years ago. We’ve put a lot of investment into benefits and store conditions and technology. We haven’t seen anything significant as far as that changing due to the economy.
36 2009-01-03 A prominent intellectual and dissident who was detained last month is being held in pretrial detention, human-rights activists said Friday. Liu Xiaobo, left, one of the driving forces behind a charter calling for democratic reforms, was taken away by the police on Dec. 8, and his location has been unknown. Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a network of rights activists, said in a statement that Mr. Liu was being held in pretrial detention. A fellow activist, Jiang Qisheng, said he was being held near Beijing. More than 160 prominent writers, scholars and human-rights advocates outside China wrote an open letter to President Hu Jintao last month demanding Mr. Liu’s release.
37 2009-01-03 Often compared to Randy Moss of the New England Patriots, Randle is a rare combination of size, explosive speed and sure hands, all of which will be on display Saturday during the United States Army All-American Bowl, an annual game here for the nation’s best high school seniors.

“He just simply takes over games and owns them,” Jeremy Crabtree, the national recruiting editor for Rivals.com, said in a telephone interview. “He takes personal pride and responsibility in making sure that he’s the guy to do the damage.”

As a junior at Bastrop High, Randle played wide receiver and had 65 catches for 1,068 yards and 11 touchdowns. Because of his athleticism, he played quarterback this season for the Fighting Rams, who were beaten in the Class 4A state semifinals.

The defeat devastated Randle, who was slowed by a hamstring injury. He finished the season with 2,461 passing yards, 20 touchdown passes and 9 interceptions, as well as 683 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns.

But Randle said he expected to benefit from his sacrifice. While playing quarterback, he said, he gained more insight into the intricacies of what is expected from a wide receiver.

“I’ll be able to communicate with my quarterback better,” Randle said. “I’ll understand what he’s thinking so we can be on the same page.”

Randle made an official visit to Oklahoma in November and is scheduled to make a trip to Oklahoma State on Friday. Other potential official visits have not been decided, his father, Emmett Randle, said.

Randle has made unofficial visits to Alabama, L.S.U. and Miami.

“I’m looking to go in there and make an impact,” Randle said. “I want to come in to the best situation possible for me as a freshman.”

Besides the return of Bradford, the Sooners are attractive to Randle because they are losing both of their starting wide receivers.

At Alabama, Randle likes the idea of lining up opposite Jones.

Randle is intrigued about playing at Oklahoma State because wide receiver Dez Bryant and quarterback Zac Robinson will return next season.

Yet he seems most passionate about L.S.U., despite a popular recruiting knock being used against the Tigers these days.

Some maintain that their Bowl Championship Series national title last season was a testament to Alabama Coach Nick Saban’s recruiting before he left L.S.U., rather than the coaching of Tigers Coach Les Miles.

But don’t try telling Randle that.

He gushed about the prospect of playing for L.S.U., which rarely loses Louisiana recruits.

“That’s my home state,” Randle said. “It’s a great school to go to. My opportunities there are great. I have a great chance of playing there. I have my family there to support me. They want to have much to do with coming to see me play. So it won’t be hard for them to travel there.”

Regardless, Randle says he is not leaning toward attending any particular college.

“I can’t really give you a favorite because it might change or it might not,” he said.

This week, Randle has added to his sterling reputation as a playmaker during practices for the Army All-American Bowl, despite battling his nagging hamstring injury.

Dre Kirkpatrick of Gadsden, Ala., who is uncommitted and ranked as the nation’s top cornerback by Rivals.com, praised Randle’s size and his ability to catch passes with his hands, not with his body. “That’s another big plus for him,” Kirkpatrick said.

But with signing day a month away, Randle is preparing for even more all-out offensives.

“I know it’s going to be crazy,” he said. “I’m just trying to brace myself for it and be up for anything.”
38 2009-01-03 “The good news is you have to do this challenge sitting down,” says the reliably annoying host. “The bad news is you have to sit down in that Porta-Potty over there that hasn’t been cleaned in a month.” The host is Joe Rogan, the moment embedded in a coming episode of “Game Show in My Head,” a new adventure in self-abasement that comes to us from Ashton Kutcher, actor/Nikon spokesman/television producer.

First, know that the title should be taken literally: on the show, which starts Saturday on CBS, contestants wear earpieces to receive instructions telling them to perform various embarrassing exercises in public places. See? The game show is in their heads.

The challenges involve persuading strangers to do uncomfortable favors. The gentleman sent to the sidewalk Porta-Potty, for instance, isn’t merely directed to sit in it; he is asked to get tissue and reading material from anyone passing by and then engage in a one-minute conversation with whomever else he can find, all the while screaming out from behind the closed door. For all of this he gets a few thousand dollars, the money he will presumably need for treating his post-traumatic dumb-game-show-stress disorder.

“Game Show in My Head” is part “Candid Camera,” part watered-down “Borat,” part yucky reminder that the next Great Depression really is coming, because, let’s face it, you’ve got to be pretty hard up to talk about your bathroom issues to strangers in the middle of a city street, all in the hopes of making an amount of money that wouldn’t even get a split-level out of foreclosure in Southern Florida. When the pranks aren’t gross, they are just inane — or, worse, demeaning to journalists. In one segment, a contestant is made to pretend he is a television news reporter and then forced to get people to attest to witnessing U.F.O.’s, on camera. Is this the kind of public relations effort the news business needs right now? I don’t think so.

Mr. Kutcher, who excels at having fun at his own expense, would do the world a far greater service if he merely replaced all the poor slobs forced into begging and pleading with — let me think — I know: Ashton Kutcher.
39 2009-01-03 HOUSTON (AP) — One year after crude oil eclipsed $100 a barrel for the first time, the new year’s trading began Friday with prices roughly half their year-earlier levels, and some believe oil could be headed even lower.

Oil markets started 2009 with crude settling above $46 a barrel. Several factors were probably at work, including continued violence in Gaza and expectations that OPEC would carry out its largest production cut ever. Market activity was also light as many traders took a long holiday weekend, and that can lead to price swings. “I have a feeling, more than anything, it’s the thin trading conditions pushing the price higher,” said Peter C. Beutel of the energy consultancy Cameron Hanover.

Oil for February delivery rose $1.74 to settle at $46.34 a barrel in New York trading.

A year ago, crude oil’s surge into triple digits for the first time was the start of a climb that peaked above a settle price of $145 a barrel in July. Since then, amid fears of a prolonged recession and crumbling worldwide demand, crude prices have plunged more than 70 percent.

The same gloomy economic data that drove prices into the mid-$30s in the final month of the year continued into 2009.

The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 1 16/32, to 112 2/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.37 percent from 2.21 percent late Wednesday.
40 2009-01-03 The Knicks, who are believed to be seeking a concession in the $2 million range, also have not changed their stance. Walsh will not release Marbury outright and has no incentive to do so. Barred from practices and games, Marbury is no longer a distraction to the team. The Knicks can simply wait until Marbury’s contract expires after the season.

There had been speculation that the Knicks did not want to see Marbury sign with certain Eastern Conference teams (including Boston) and therefore would structure a buyout with a condition that he sign with a Western Conference team. But such an arrangement would not be permitted under N.B.A. rules.

Also, a person involved in the Knicks’ internal discussions said that Walsh was more concerned with Marbury’s going to a team like Miami, a rival for a playoff spot. Team officials admittedly would prefer not to see Marbury hoisting the Larry O’Brien N.B.A. championship trophy in June, but it is not their greatest concern.

The Celtics’ apparent interest is curious, but understandable. They lost two valuable bench players over the summer, when P. J. Brown retired and James Posey signed with the New Orleans Hornets. Although they believe their starting five has improved since last season, the Celtics are concerned about their depth.

Marbury turns 32 next month and is well removed from his days as a top-10 point guard. But he is still a capable scorer and a potentially valuable third guard, if he is willing to back up Rajon Rondo and Ray Allen. Marbury played well in the preseason, but he has not played in a regular-season game in nearly a year.

One thing seems certain, based on the Celtics’ team culture. They will not sign Marbury unless everyone agrees, including the team president, Danny Ainge; Coach Doc Rivers; and the team’s three best players, Allen, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. Those discussions have not yet taken place, a team official said.

Rivers emphasizes chemistry over just about everything else, so he may have to be persuaded. Marbury clashed with his last two coaches in New York, Larry Brown and Isiah Thomas, which is partly why the new coach, Mike D’Antoni, decided not to play him this season. When D’Antoni and Walsh arrived in the spring, they quickly discovered that Marbury was terribly unpopular with his teammates.

None of this means that Marbury will not end up wearing shamrocks and playing for a title in June. It just means that, if he does, it will make for a fascinating case study for the folks at M.I.T.
41 2009-01-03 At Ben’s Chili Bowl, one of the city’s oldest and most famous restaurants, the inauguration offers a certain historical reconciliation.

“It took about 40 years,” said Kamal Ali, the owner and son of the restaurant’s founder, Ben Ali. “But in terms of race relations, the celebration that day will bring this neighborhood, this city, full circle.”

In April 1968, four days of race riots here after the King assassination left 12 people dead. Huge swaths of what was then called Black Broadway for its concentration of black-owned clubs and theaters were destroyed. Ben’s Chili Bowl was one of the few restaurants along U Street that was not burned or ransacked.

“What happened here along U Street on election night when Obama won was the exact inverse of those race riots,” said Mr. Ali, recounting how on Nov. 4 the streets filled with racially diverse crowds who were initially kept out of traffic by a large and somewhat jittery police force. Eventually, he said, the police opted to close down the area and let the partyers celebrate freely.

Across the Anacostia River, in one of the city’s poorest sections, Thomas Thorton, 82, sat waiting for a bus.

“For us, for this side of the river, the inauguration is personal,” Mr. Thorton said, standing in front of the hilltop Washington View Apartments, not far from the former home of the abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

Mr. Obama’s message of renewed possibility resonates in Washington, he said, because this city, like few others, embodies extremes within inner-city and black America. Washington has some of the highest rates of incarceration and infant mortality in the country, yet it also has one of the largest populations of college-educated and upper-income African-Americans of any large city.

“It’s one day when all the folks in this city really can really come together and share something,” Mr. Thorton said of the inauguration. “We can think about how much has changed.”

In choosing Mr. Fenty two years ago, Washingtonians bucked the candidate selected by the Democratic Party machine and opted for a younger, more liberal biracial candidate who relied on a populist message and a huge grass-roots effort to straddle the city’s racial and class divides.

“Voters are not looking for categories,” said Mr. Fenty, who, like Mr. Obama, is the child of a black father and a white mother. “They’re looking for results.”

Mr. Fenty added that the city was especially hopeful that Mr. Obama would help deliver voting rights for the city’s nearly 600,000 residents, who have no voting representation in Congress.

More than any previous presidential candidate, Mr. Obama has supported changing that, and with a Democratic majority in Congress, there is a real chance the city could win those rights. Mr. Fenty said that early in Mr. Obama’s candidacy, he told Mr. Obama that he wanted to support him but that voting rights was one issue Mr. Obama needed to get firmly behind. “He promised he would,” Mr. Fenty said.

In an early test of Mr. Obama’s commitment to follow through on that promise, the City Council last month sent him a letter asking him to put District of Columbia license plates that bear the phrase “Taxation Without Representation” on the presidential motorcade.

President Bill Clinton used the plates briefly at the end of his second term. President Bush has not, opting for district plates without the phrase.

Asked if she thought this inauguration would be different than previous ones, Alice Mukabane, the co-owner of Safari DC, a Kenyan restaurant on Georgia Avenue, laughed. “Of course, and not because of race,” Ms. Mukabane said.

Behind her a collection of posters and photographs of Barack and Michelle Obama hung on a wall in an area she calls the Obama Corner.

“Obama came from a home with just one parent,” Ms. Mukabane said. “He worked as a community organizer. He has ties to inner-city Chicago. He can relate to real people like those who live here.”

Like so many tourists, foreign dignitaries and Capitol Hill staff members, presidents are transients here. To them, the city consists only of an eight-block radius around the White House. Beyond that is hostile territory.

Residents hope, however, that Mr. Obama, already at ease in big cities, will get out more than Mr. Bush.

“This city considers Obama as one of our own,” Ms. Mukabane said, “and I think that will show on inauguration. But after the inauguration, we’re also hoping he will see the city as his own.”

From the ceiling of her restaurant hung a large white banner filled with well-wishes written by customers. Four squares remained empty, reserved for the first family’s signatures.
42 2009-01-03 So let’s go back to the beginning to put these options into context.

Most families saving for college start with the same tool, the 529 account. States tend to have at least one of their own that allows you to save your money in a menu of mutual funds from companies like Vanguard and Fidelity.

As of Sept. 30, there was $101.7 billion in 529 accounts nationwide, according to the Financial Research Corporation, a research firm.

The popularity stems mostly from the tax advantages. While you deposit after-tax money in the accounts, you do not pay any taxes on the earnings as long as you use them for qualified educational expenses. Most states that levy an income tax offer some kind of tax deduction on contributions into your home state’s 529. The most popular investments for new money going into 529 accounts, according to Financial Research Corporation figures, are funds that are similar to the target-date funds that exist in so many 401(k) retirement plans.

These age-based 529 accounts contain a high portion of stocks at first but get more conservative over time, as the account beneficiary gets closer to starting college.

The big hitch here is that states and their investment company partners have all sorts of definitions of what “more conservative” actually means. This may come as a huge surprise to parents who take a set-it-and-forget-it approach to saving, blithely dumping money into these funds without knowing how they are divided up.

This can become a big problem once your child is a teenager, as you face the stark realization that saving for college is nothing at all like saving for retirement. There, the money may need to last — but can grow and fall and recover again — for 20 years or more after you stop working. With college savings, you are going to need the money — all of it, most likely — within five years of when the child starts college. In November, Joe Hurley, the founder of , a comprehensive guide to 529s and the various state options, published a study of every state’s asset allocation in their age-based funds for teenagers close to starting college.

On one extreme, ’s CollegeHorizonFunds, managed by J.& W. Seligman & Company, had more than half of the money for a child one year from starting college invested in stocks and real estate securities. That fund had lost 30 percent of its value in the first 11 months of 2008.

’s age-based option, however, had no money in equities for students 16 or over and two or less years from starting college. In the first 11 months of this year, it gained 1.63 percent.

“These programs are designed for families to save for college, not for them to make a lot of money in the stock market,” said Tom Wallace, who runs Florida’s college savings plans and agreed that “paternalistic” would not be an exaggeration in describing the state’s views on the matter. “We’re not here to hit home runs. We want to hit singles and doubles.”

On the face of it, losing nearly a third of a 17-year-old’s college money in 11 months, as the North Carolina fund did, seems utterly indefensible. Julia R. Hoke, the director of legal affairs and general counsel for the state agency that oversees its plans, said that state residents can choose other age-based options if they wish.

She makes a reasonable point, though you have to wonder whether there are enough 17-year-olds and their parents for whom such an aggressive asset allocation is appropriate. The risk of the wrong people ending up in this fund is much greater than the harm that would come from forcing Seligman to change its strategy.

Scott Thomas, an accountant in Burlington, N.C., had some money in the fund that he intended to use for the first year of college for a child who was a year away from enrolling.

“I was one year out thinking that I was pretty safe, and it turned out I was pretty well exposed to the drop in the equity markets,” he said. “I should have thought a little deeper about that and looked at the allocation a little more closely.”

Ms. Hoke added that it would be a mistake for the state to act too hastily in making fundamental changes to its lineup of funds or their strategies based only on one extraordinary year in the markets. After all, big swings like this are pretty rare.

But it is your children who can end up on the losing end. Back in the mid-1970s, before the birth of the 529 account, the family of Elaine D. Scoggins hit a bad financial patch because of that era’s market swoon.

Ms. Scoggins was supposed to leave her hometown, , Ga., as many of her friends did, to go to college. Instead, she stayed home and worked her way through the local state school. “I thought it was the worst moment of my life,” she said.

But the experience turned out to be formative, giving her a background in budgeting and other skills that allowed her to become a successful banker and then a financial planner at Merriman Berkman Next in . Still, she trots out that story from time to time when she runs into families who are determined to milk every last dollar of gain out of their college savings fund.

“There comes a time when it becomes about preservation, not growth,” she said. “There’s also a factor called peace of mind with all of this. You can’t underestimate that when talking about a child’s education.”

I’m with the Florida fund on this one. There’s just too much risk, however small it may be, in putting a 16- or 17-year-old’s college money in equities. Better to invest it in a mix of safe bonds, money market funds and the certificates of deposit that some 529s offer.

There is one big caveat here, and a few other things to consider. First, the caveat: If you take this approach, tuition inflation may outpace the growth of your 529 account for the year or two before your children start school and the four or more years they are enrolled.

If $100,000 is enough to pay for four years of tuition at its current rate, 7 percent inflation would bring the bill to nearly $115,000 after two years. “But your 529 might only be worth $102,000 two years later,” said Chris Sharpe, a portfolio manager who helps oversee the asset allocation of Fidelity’s age-based 529 plans. At Fidelity, accounts for students already enrolled in college have 20 percent of the money invested in stocks.

I also have not mentioned prepaid 529 accounts, which allow families to pay now (often at a premium) in return for credits or certificates that they can use to pay for college later. It sounds like a great way to lock in a price early on, but not every state has a prepaid plan.

Some that do have had to close their plans to new participants to avoid insolvency. And the plans can cause problems for students who end up at a private university, among other issues. Still, some families may find them useful, and Chapter Five of Joe Hurley’s book, “The Best Way to Save for College,” is a good place to study up on the subject.

It is also worth noting that all may not be lost for investors in funds like the one in North Carolina. Families might use other resources or current income to pay for the first few years of college while doubling down on stocks in their 529 accounts to profit from a rebound. Hey, it could work. Or, they could extend the time horizon even further by using the money in a 529 for a child’s graduate school education, which is allowed, or changing the beneficiary to use it for a younger sibling, which is also fine.

Still, why put yourself in this situation? If a 529 account is your main source of college savings, you should pat yourself on the back when your child turns 16 for having saved whatever you could. Then, move the money someplace safer within the 529 until the tuition bill comes due.
43 2009-01-03 So when stocks opened higher on Friday, in their first day of trading for 2009, investors may have had one more reason to cheer them on. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 258.3 points, or 2.94 percent, to 9,034.69, Friday, and the S.& P. 500 jumped 3.16 percent, or 28.55 points, to close at its highest level since early November, 931.80. That index is up 24 percent since Nov. 20, when it hit its lowest point in more than a decade. The Nasdaq composite index rose 55.18 points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,632.21.

One variation of the proverb has it that the first five days of trading are the best predictor of the year to come. Others recommend looking at 10 days: the last five days of trading in December and the first five days of trading in January.

Other Wall Street lore has it that investors “should sell in May and go away,” that September is the worst month for stocks and that October is when markets have cataclysmic crashes. Some market specialists, including Peter Lynch, who once ran Fidelity’s Magellan Fund, say investors should take advantage of the stock market’s tendency to swoon on Mondays and rally on Fridays.

Academics and market specialists say they have confirmed the existence of the so-called January barometer effect, but they are stumped as to why it exists, or should even exist at all.

“Any statistician would tell you its abnormal,” said Mr. Silverblatt. “I would not attempt to justify it. Each year is separate and different.”

Some scholars say the effect is a statistical anomaly that applies only to the American stock market. In a paper released several months ago, two scholars at a German university confirmed previous findings about American stocks in January but said they found no similar correlation in 11 of the 14 countries they studied. Among countries that do not appear to follow the rule are Canada, Japan and Britain.

Even as scholars disagree about the power of January as a barometer for the year, many others believe that the month is good for investors in the shares of small companies. One study by two professors at the University of Kansas found that from 1927 to 2004, equal-weighted indexes — which give equal prominence to big- and small-company stocks — returned 6 percent more on average in January than the 11 other months.

One explanation offered for this difference is that individual investors tend to hold more small-company stocks than do large institutions like mutual fund firms. Individuals are more likely to sell stocks in December to lock in capital losses before the year-end tax deadline and buy them back in January. Tax laws apply somewhat differently to mutual fund managers, giving them an incentive to sell money-losing stocks months earlier.

It could also be that individuals are investing early in the year because they are making contributions to their retirement accounts for the new year and because many employers distribute bonuses at the start of the year.

Because there are fewer buyers and sellers of small-company stock, they can be easily pushed up or down by individual investors, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.

“Tax-loss selling in illiquid securities is going to have a pretty big impact,” he said. “But if you have tax-loss selling in I.B.M. and G.E., it’s no big deal.”

Still, talk of market patterns, specialists say, should be leavened with that familiar warning attached to most investment brochures and prospectuses: past performance is no guarantee of future returns.
44 2009-01-03 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan briefly reopened the Khyber Pass on Friday, three days after it was sealed off as part of a military offensive against Taliban guerrillas. The passage is the most important supply route for American and other NATO troops fighting the Taliban movement in neighboring Afghanistan.

The main road through the pass, in northwestern Pakistan, was open for six hours on Friday morning and afternoon and was expected to be open for the same duration on Saturday, said Tariq Hayat, the top official in the Khyber Agency, the formal name for the surrounding political district. He said 800 cars, buses, tractors and cargo trucks traveled the road on Friday.

“As our comfort zone increases, we will be easing off on the restriction of movement,” Mr. Hayat said. “Right now, we are still in the middle of active operations.”

However, the critical test will not come until after the Khyber military operation is finished. Some militants are thought to have moved to other areas to avoid the offensive, and after similar military operations in western Pakistan, the guerrillas simply migrated back and resumed attacks once the troops departed.

The Khyber Pass has been a critical trade and military gateway since the time of Alexander the Great, but like much of western Pakistan it has been besieged by the Taliban. Their steady encroachment, which has included attacking cargo trucks and burning down supply depots last month, has the American military scrambling to line up alternative routes into Afghanistan through Russia and Central Asia. Many truckers had already quit driving through the pass because of the danger.

NATO officials have said the militants have so far not interrupted their supplies. But they have acknowledged that suppressing the militants or finding alternative routes is critical, especially as the American troop deployment to Afghanistan is expected to as much as double this year to 60,000.
45 2009-01-03 General surgeons are in short supply in America’s rural areas, The Washington Post reports, as growing numbers of young doctors opt for non-surgical specialties and surgeons flock to higher-paying fields like transplant surgery or plastic surgery. The director of the American College of Surgery’s Health Policy Institute, George F. Sheldon, says the shortage is “at crisis dimensions.”

More and more Americans are stressed by financial problems, the San Francisco Chronicle says. Losing a job can lead to anxiety, depression and antisocial behavior, said Ralph Catalano, a professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley. An October report by the American Psychological Survey found that 83 percent of American women and 78 percent of men were beset by financial worries.

Federal authorities haven’t done it, so states are pushing through laws requiring cigarettes to be self-extinguishing, USA Today reports. Already 18 states allow only the sale of cigarettes that go out if they’re dropped or set aside, and 14 more such state laws are set to go into effect this year.

Talk about New Year’s resolutions -- a 33-year-old New Yorker who weighed 640 pounds at his heaviest is down to 210 pounds after undergoing gastric bypass surgery, The Daily News reports. Ernesto Suncar, a father of three, was so big his son had to tie his shoelaces for him. He decided to undergo surgery when he started having difficulties breathing and doctors told him his weight could kill him.

The British government is launching a massive TV campaign that urges citizens to “eat well, move more, live longer.” The “Change 4 Life” animated videos give a brief history of mankind from cavemen days -- when people had to “run around for their food” -- to today, when cars, TV, computers and fast food are putting nine of ten British kids at risk of obesity and heart disease. Big food companies including Kellogg’s, Unilever and PepsiCo are sponsoring the media campaign.

Oregon regulators have fined a health insurer $46,000 after discovering the company denied some 5,000 claims over three years without ever contacting the customers or health care providers to determine if the services should be covered, according to Statesmanjournal.com. A review done by the insurer, PacifiCare Life Assurance, a member of UnitedHealth Group, found that almost half the 10,000 claims it denied during a 21-month-period should have been paid.
46 2009-01-03 GMAC had paid G.M. an annual exclusivity fee and had been required to meet targets for leases and loans, the filing said. The exclusivity deal was effective through November 2016, according to the filing.

Also in the filing, GMAC said the government exercised a 10-year warrant to buy 250,000 more GMAC preferred shares for a penny each.

GMAC said if the Treasury does not get interest payments on its preferred shares for six consecutive quarters, or more than six nonconsecutive quarters, it will get two seats on an expanded GMAC management board.

“These two managers will serve until all accrued and unpaid distributions on the Series D-1 Preferred Interests have been paid in full,” GMAC said in the filing.

GMAC is 49 percent owned by G.M. and 51 percent owned by the private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management.

On Wednesday, GMAC finished a complicated debt deal intended to raise capital and help the struggling auto and mortgage loan company ride out a historic collapse in auto sales.

The results of the debt exchange fell short of GMAC’s previously stated goals. But they came a week after the Federal Reserve went ahead and approved GMAC’s application for bank holding status, making it eligible for part of the government’s $700 billion bank rescue package.

GMAC said that bondholders owning $21.2 billion of its debt agreed to the exchange. A total of $17.5 billion, or 59 percent, of the GMAC notes were tendered, along with $3.7 billion, or 39 percent, of notes issued by Residential Capital, GMAC’s home loan unit. GMAC had hoped for 75 percent participation on both offers.

Yet Standard & Poor’s Rating Services on Wednesday cut certain debt ratings for both GMAC and Residential Capital to “Selective Default” after the deal was announced. It said the debt deal paid less than face value to certain bondholders and devalued the bonds that had not been swapped.

GMAC, which has been hit this year by the downturns in both the automotive and housing markets, posted losses totaling $5.59 billion for the first three quarters.

GMAC got the $5 billion in aid from the Treasury Department earlier this week. In addition, the Treasury said it would lend up to $1 billion to G.M. so that the automaker would be able to buy more equity from GMAC. Those purchases are expected to raise more capital for GMAC.

Analysts had speculated that GMAC could fail without the federal aid.

GMAC provides 85 percent of loans that G.M. dealers use to stock car and truck inventory. If GMAC were to fail, those dealers would have a tough time getting financing from other sources.

Company officials had said that becoming a bank was GMAC’s best hope for survival. Inthe filings, GMAC said it needed to show that it had $30 billion in capital in order for the Fed to approve its application to become a bank holding company. GMAC also said in the filings that it hoped to raise a significant part of that through the debt-swap offers.

G.M. also received federal help this week to hold off bankruptcy protection. The giant Detroit-based automaker on Wednesday night received the first installment of $9.4 billion in low-cost government loans.

The $4 billion in government aid comes just in time to avert financial disaster because it has large payments because of parts suppliers starting on Friday.

52 2009-01-04 Chess can be daunting to learn. Part of the reason is the vast literature about how to play, particularly the opening phase — the first 15 moves or so.

There are more than 1,300 openings. Most tournament players focus on a small number that are suited to their style.

Thirty years ago, the top players would also concentrate on a few openings, but today’s stars are more flexible. The Internet, the widespread use of computers that play chess, and the databases of games have forced them to change. Modern players know more than their predecessors, so they are more comfortable with a wider range of positions. They also closely study their rivals’ games.

As a result, opening choices are less influenced by taste and more by psychology. Is the opponent’s style aggressive or conservative? Does he play more by calculation or by feel? Does he favor open positions, or does he slowly maneuver behind a wall of pawns? And, of course, which openings does he prefer?

Flexibility was on display at the third Grand Prix tournament in Elista, Russia, which wrapped up last weekend. No player stuck to just one or even two openings. The winners, Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Dmitry Jakovenko and Alexander Grischuk of Russia, each played several main systems.
53 2009-01-04 A year into the recession, millions of Americans have already lost their jobs, their incomes and their homes. Millions more are having their peace of mind tested daily by the certainty of harder times to come. Yet as the recession deepens, one small group could actually catch a break: the richest Americans, who are likely to see a proposed tax increase postponed.

During the campaign, President-elect pledged to raise taxes, starting in 2009, on roughly the top 5 percent of American households, generally defined as those making more than $250,000 a year. The objective was to restore fairness and raise revenue by undoing Bush-era tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich while worsening the budget deficit.

The Obama team has not officially ditched that plan. But it is sounding increasingly reluctant to move soon. A delay is supported by the conventional wisdom that raising any taxes during a downturn is wrong.

That argument starts with the correct premise that a stalled economy needs all the juice it can get, hence the need for the roughly $800 billion recovery package to spur consumption and create jobs, taking shape in Congress and championed by Mr. Obama. But not all tax increases are damaging in a recession. An increase could help if it raised more in revenue than it subtracted in consumption and if that revenue was used for stimulus.

That sounds like the very definition of a tax increase for the richest Americans. The wealthy are unlikely to slow their consumption much if their income tax rates return — as Mr. Obama has proposed — to their pre-Bush levels (an increase from rates of 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent).
54 2009-01-04 Ms. Kennedy’s finances have been a source of curiosity since she entered the contest to be named New York’s next senator. She has property in New York and on Martha’s Vineyard, and estimates of their worth have varied greatly. Great wealth, of course, can be an asset in an age of expensive campaigns.

Until 2004, public servants were generally required to file disclosure forms if they were officers or directors of agencies or if their salaries indicated high-level responsibility. That year, the city was able to shrink the rolls of those required to file by scrapping the salary test, and instead declaring that anyone holding a policymaking position had to file, regardless of income.

The city even spelled out what it meant to be considered a policymaker: someone who has “major responsibilities and exercises independent judgment in connection with determining important agency matters.”

“Public servants with substantial policy discretion include, but are not limited to, agency heads, deputy agency heads, assistant agency heads and public servants in charge of any major office, division, bureau or unit of an agency,” according to the city. Each agency or department makes the initial determination of who should be deemed a policymaker. The list is then subject to the review of the city’s conflicts-of-interest board, which has ultimate responsibility for collecting the annual forms and making them available to the public.

Though the Education Department is supposed to follow the same rules as every other arm of city government, it has issued its own regulations over the years as to who must file. The conflicts-of-interest board has not protested the department’s decisions regarding the Office of Strategic Partnerships, which Ms. Kennedy headed.

Last week, the board again referred all questions about the matter to the Education Department.

The department’s own written regulations make no mention of a class of “policymakers” who must file. Instead, it notes that employees have to file if they are in the management pay plan or have responsibilities over “contracts, leases, franchises, concessions and applications for variances and special permits” or if they are “serving in sensitive, confidential positions.”

In interviews, Ms. Kennedy has said that should she be chosen for the Senate job, she is “going to comply with every kind of disclosure that’s available.”

When she first went to work for Mr. Klein in October 2002, the job was a break from her former low profile. With fanfare, Mr. Klein put Ms. Kennedy in charge of raising money for the public schools from private sources, and said she would work closely with the department’s affiliated nonprofit organization, the Fund for Public Schools.

The department also announced that she would be in charge of the office of special adviser for the arts, and volunteer efforts like tutoring and mentoring. The next year’s official guide to New York City government listed Ms. Kennedy fifth from the top on the list of executives in the office of the chancellor.

By the middle of 2003, the department announced that Ms. Kennedy had second thoughts about accepting the $90,000 salary initially offered and would instead work for $1 a year.

City officials told The Daily News that July that she alone among those who had elected to forgo a paycheck would not be filing disclosure forms for the prior year because “the Ed Department deleted salary specifications from Kennedy’s specially created post.”

But people who drew nominal salaries at other city agencies at the time were still required to file. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff filed, as did Andrew Alper, then serving as chief of the Economic Development Corporation.

“The department determined that she did not fall into any of the categories in the pre-2004 disclosure law,” that governed the filing for 2002, said Michael Best, the general counsel for the Department of Education. Likewise, he said, Ms. Kennedy was not obliged to file for 2003 or 2004 because “she did not fit into any of the categories” once the law changed and the department concluded that “she did not have any policymaking position at the Department of Education.”

In August 2004, Ms. Kennedy announced that she was quitting her post in city government, though she continues to raise millions of dollars for the schools through her role as vice chairwoman of the board of the Fund for Public Schools.

While her departure from the city’s rolls cut short the debate over whether she should have been filing, two of those who worked for her were not spared.

Aida Bekele, a lawyer who reported that she was making $115,000 a year as chief of staff for the Office of Strategic Partnerships in 2003, had to file disclosure forms for 2003. So did Charissa Fernandez, who listed herself that year as a director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships, making $100,000 a year.
55 2009-01-04 This is more plausible than it may sound. Sweden, of all places, did it successfully in 1992. And remember, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have already accepted, on behalf of the taxpayer, just about all of the downside risk of owning the bigger financial firms. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve would both no doubt argue that if you don’t prop up these banks you risk an enormous credit contraction — if they aren’t in business who will be left to lend money? But something like the reverse seems more true: propping up failed banks and extending them huge amounts of credit has made business more difficult for the people and companies that had nothing to do with creating the mess. Perfectly solvent companies are being squeezed out of business by their creditors precisely because they are not in the Treasury’s fold. With so much lending effectively federally guaranteed, lenders are fleeing anything that is not.

Rather than tackle the source of the problem, the people running the bailout desperately want to reinflate the credit bubble, prop up the stock market and head off a recession. Their efforts are clearly failing: 2008 was a historically bad year for the stock market, and we’ll be in recession for some time to come. Our leaders have framed the problem as a “crisis of confidence” but what they actually seem to mean is “please pay no attention to the problems we are failing to address.”

In its latest push to compel confidence, for instance, the authorities are placing enormous pressure on the Financial Accounting Standards Board to suspend “mark-to-market” accounting. Basically, this means that the banks will not have to account for the actual value of the assets on their books but can claim instead that they are worth whatever they paid for them.

This will have the double effect of reducing transparency and increasing self-delusion (gorge yourself for months, but refuse to step on a scale, and maybe no one will realize you gained weight). And it will fool no one. When you shout at people “be confident,” you shouldn’t expect them to be anything but terrified.

If we are going to spend trillions of dollars of taxpayer money, it makes more sense to focus less on the failed institutions at the top of the financial system and more on the individuals at the bottom. Instead of buying dodgy assets and guaranteeing deals that should never have been made in the first place, we should use our money to A) repair the social safety net, now badly rent in ways that cause perfectly rational people to be terrified; and B) transform the bailout of the banks into a rescue of homeowners.

We should begin by breaking the cycle of deteriorating housing values and resulting foreclosures. Many homeowners realize that it doesn’t make sense to make payments on a mortgage that exceeds the value of their house. As many as 20 million families face the decision of whether to make the payments or turn in the keys. Congress seems to have understood this problem, which is why last year it created a program under the Federal Housing Authority to issue homeowners new government loans based on the current appraised value of their homes.

And yet the program, called Hope Now, seems to have become one more excellent example of the unhappy political influence of Wall Street. As it now stands, banks must initiate any new loan; and they are loath to do so because it requires them to recognize an immediate loss. They prefer to “work with borrowers” through loan modifications and payment plans that present fewer accounting and earnings problems but fail to resolve and, thereby, prolong the underlying issues. It appears that the banking lobby also somehow inserted into the law the dubious requirement that troubled homeowners repay all home equity loans before qualifying. The result: very few loans will be issued through this program.

THIS could be fixed. Congress might grant qualifying homeowners the ability to get new government loans based on the current appraised values without requiring their bank’s consent. When a corporation gets into trouble, its lenders often accept a partial payment in return for some share in any future recovery. Similarly, homeowners should be permitted to satisfy current first mortgages with a combination of the proceeds of the new government loan and a share in any future recovery from the future sale or refinancing of their homes. Lenders who issued second mortgages should be forced to release their claims on property. The important point is that homeowners, not lenders, be granted the right to obtain new government loans. To work, the program needs to be universal and should not require homeowners to file for bankruptcy.

There are also a handful of other perfectly obvious changes in the financial system to be made, to prevent some version of what has happened from happening all over again. A short list:

Stop making big regulatory decisions with long-term consequences based on their short-term effect on stock prices. Stock prices go up and down: let them. An absurd number of the official crises have been negotiated and resolved over weekends so that they may be presented as a fait accompli “before the Asian markets open.” The hasty crisis-to-crisis policy decision-making lacks coherence for the obvious reason that it is more or less driven by a desire to please the stock market. The Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. all seem to view propping up stock prices as a critical part of their mission — indeed, the Federal Reserve sometimes seems more concerned than the average Wall Street trader with the market’s day-to-day movements. If the policies are sound, the stock market will eventually learn to take care of itself.

End the official status of the rating agencies. Given their performance it’s hard to believe credit rating agencies are still around. There’s no question that the world is worse off for the existence of companies like Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. There should be a rule against issuers paying for ratings. Either investors should pay for them privately or, if public ratings are deemed essential, they should be publicly provided.

Regulate credit-default swaps. There are now tens of trillions of dollars in these contracts between big financial firms. An awful lot of the bad stuff that has happened to our financial system has happened because it was never explained in plain, simple language. Financial innovators were able to create new products and markets without anyone thinking too much about their broader financial consequences — and without regulators knowing very much about them at all. It doesn’t matter how transparent financial markets are if no one can understand what’s inside them. Until very recently, companies haven’t had to provide even cursory disclosure of credit-default swaps in their financial statements.

Credit-default swaps may not be Exhibit No. 1 in the case against financial complexity, but they are useful evidence. Whatever credit defaults are in theory, in practice they have become mainly side bets on whether some company, or some subprime mortgage-backed bond, some municipality, or even the United States government will go bust. In the extreme case, subprime mortgage bonds were created so that smart investors, using credit-default swaps, could bet against them. Call it insurance if you like, but it’s not the insurance most people know. It’s more like buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, possibly for many times the value of that house — from a company that probably doesn’t have any real ability to pay you if someone sets fire to the whole neighborhood. The most critical role for regulation is to make sure that the sellers of risk have the capital to support their bets.

Impose new capital requirements on banks. The new international standard now being adopted by American banks is known in the trade as Basel II. Basel II is premised on the belief that banks do a better job than regulators of measuring their own risks — because the banks have the greater interest in not failing. Back in 2004, the S.E.C. put in place its own version of this standard for investment banks. We know how that turned out. A better idea would be to require banks to hold less capital in bad times and more capital in good times. Now that we have seen how too-big-to-fail financial institutions behave, it is clear that relieving them of stringent requirements is not the way to go.

Another good solution to the too-big-to-fail problem is to break up any institution that becomes too big to fail.

Close the revolving door between the S.E.C. and Wall Street. At every turn we keep coming back to an enormous barrier to reform: Wall Street’s political influence. Its influence over the S.E.C. is further compromised by its ability to enrich the people who work for it. Realistically, there is only so much that can be done to fix the problem, but one measure is obvious: forbid regulators, for some meaningful amount of time after they have left the S.E.C., from accepting high-paying jobs with Wall Street firms.

But keep the door open the other way. If the S.E.C. is to restore its credibility as an investor protection agency, it should have some experienced, respected investors (which is not the same thing as investment bankers) as commissioners. President-elect Barack Obama should nominate at least one with a notable career investing capital, and another with experience uncovering corporate misconduct. As it happens, the most critical job, chief of enforcement, now has a perfect candidate, a civic-minded former investor with firsthand experience of the S.E.C.’s ineptitude: Harry Markopolos.

The funny thing is, there’s nothing all that radical about most of these changes. A disinterested person would probably wonder why many of them had not been made long ago. A committee of people whose financial interests are somehow bound up with Wall Street is a different matter.
56 2009-01-04 In the “Highly Likely” scenario, wrote Mr. Markopolos, “Madoff Securities is the world’s largest Ponzi Scheme.” Which, as we now know, it was.

Harry Markopolos sent his report to the S.E.C. on Nov. 7, 2005 — more than three years before Mr. Madoff was finally exposed — but he had been trying to explain the fraud to them since 1999. He had no direct financial interest in exposing Mr. Madoff — he wasn’t an unhappy investor or a disgruntled employee. There was no way to short shares in Madoff Securities, and so Mr. Markopolos could not have made money directly from Mr. Madoff’s failure. To judge from his letter, Harry Markopolos anticipated mainly downsides for himself: he declined to put his name on it for fear of what might happen to him and his family if anyone found out he had written it. And yet the S.E.C.’s cursory investigation of Mr. Madoff pronounced him free of fraud.

What’s interesting about the Madoff scandal, in retrospect, is how little interest anyone inside the financial system had in exposing it. It wasn’t just Harry Markopolos who smelled a rat. As Mr. Markopolos explained in his letter, Goldman Sachs was refusing to do business with Mr. Madoff; many others doubted Mr. Madoff’s profits or assumed he was front-running his customers and steered clear of him. Between the lines, Mr. Markopolos hinted that even some of Mr. Madoff’s investors may have suspected that they were the beneficiaries of a scam. After all, it wasn’t all that hard to see that the profits were too good to be true. Some of Mr. Madoff’s investors may have reasoned that the worst that could happen to them, if the authorities put a stop to the front-running, was that a good thing would come to an end.

The Madoff scandal echoes a deeper absence inside our financial system, which has been undermined not merely by bad behavior but by the lack of checks and balances to discourage it. “Greed” doesn’t cut it as a satisfying explanation for the current financial crisis. Greed was necessary but insufficient; in any case, we are as likely to eliminate greed from our national character as we are lust and envy. The fixable problem isn’t the greed of the few but the misaligned interests of the many.

A lot has been said and written, for instance, about the corrupting effects on Wall Street of gigantic bonuses. What happened inside the major Wall Street firms, though, was more deeply unsettling than greedy people lusting for big checks: leaders of public corporations, especially financial corporations, are as good as required to lead for the short term.

Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, E. Stanley O’Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup’s chief executive, may have paid themselves humongous sums of money at the end of each year, as a result of the bond market bonanza. But if any one of them had set himself up as a whistleblower — had stood up and said “this business is irresponsible and we are not going to participate in it” — he would probably have been fired. Not immediately, perhaps. But a few quarters of earnings that lagged behind those of every other Wall Street firm would invite outrage from subordinates, who would flee for other, less responsible firms, and from shareholders, who would call for his resignation. Eventually he’d be replaced by someone willing to make money from the credit bubble.

OUR financial catastrophe, like Bernard Madoff’s pyramid scheme, required all sorts of important, plugged-in people to sacrifice our collective long-term interests for short-term gain. The pressure to do this in today’s financial markets is immense. Obviously the greater the market pressure to excel in the short term, the greater the need for pressure from outside the market to consider the longer term. But that’s the problem: there is no longer any serious pressure from outside the market. The tyranny of the short term has extended itself with frightening ease into the entities that were meant to, one way or another, discipline Wall Street, and force it to consider its enlightened self-interest.

Everyone now knows that Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s botched their analyses of bonds backed by home mortgages. But their most costly mistake — one that deserves a lot more attention than it has received — lies in their area of putative expertise: measuring corporate risk.

Over the last 20 years American financial institutions have taken on more and more risk, with the blessing of regulators, with hardly a word from the rating agencies, which, incidentally, are paid by the issuers of the bonds they rate. Seldom if ever did Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s say, “If you put one more risky asset on your balance sheet, you will face a serious downgrade.”

The American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, General Electric and the municipal bond guarantors Ambac Financial and MBIA all had triple-A ratings. (G.E. still does!) Large investment banks like Lehman and Merrill Lynch all had solid investment grade ratings. It’s almost as if the higher the rating of a financial institution, the more likely it was to contribute to financial catastrophe. But of course all these big financial companies fueled the creation of the credit products that in turn fueled the revenues of Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

These oligopolies, which are actually sanctioned by the S.E.C., didn’t merely do their jobs badly. They didn’t simply miss a few calls here and there. In pursuit of their own short-term earnings, they did exactly the opposite of what they were meant to do: rather than expose financial risk they systematically disguised it.

This is a subject that might be profitably explored in Washington. There are many questions an enterprising United States senator might want to ask the credit-rating agencies. Here is one: Why did you allow MBIA to keep its triple-A rating for so long? In 1990 MBIA was in the relatively simple business of insuring municipal bonds. It had $931 million in equity and only $200 million of debt — and a plausible triple-A rating.

By 2006 MBIA had plunged into the much riskier business of guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s. But by then it had $7.2 billion in equity against an astounding $26.2 billion in debt. That is, even as it insured ever-greater risks in its business, it also took greater risks on its balance sheet.

Yet the rating agencies didn’t so much as blink. On Wall Street the problem was hardly a secret: many people understood that MBIA didn’t deserve to be rated triple-A. As far back as 2002, a hedge fund called Gotham Partners published a persuasive report, widely circulated, entitled: “Is MBIA Triple A?” (The answer was obviously no.)

At the same time, almost everyone believed that the rating agencies would never downgrade MBIA, because doing so was not in their short-term financial interest. A downgrade of MBIA would force the rating agencies to go through the costly and cumbersome process of re-rating tens of thousands of credits that bore triple-A ratings simply by virtue of MBIA’s guarantee. It would stick a wrench in the machine that enriched them. (In June, finally, the rating agencies downgraded MBIA, after MBIA’s failure became such an open secret that nobody any longer cared about its formal credit rating.)

The S.E.C. now promises modest new measures to contain the damage that the rating agencies can do — measures that fail to address the central problem: that the raters are paid by the issuers.

But this should come as no surprise, for the S.E.C. itself is plagued by similarly wacky incentives. Indeed, one of the great social benefits of the Madoff scandal may be to finally reveal the S.E.C. for what it has become.

Created to protect investors from financial predators, the commission has somehow evolved into a mechanism for protecting financial predators with political clout from investors. (The task it has performed most diligently during this crisis has been to question, intimidate and impose rules on short-sellers — the only market players who have a financial incentive to expose fraud and abuse.)

The instinct to avoid short-term political heat is part of the problem; anything the S.E.C. does to roil the markets, or reduce the share price of any given company, also roils the careers of the people who run the S.E.C. Thus it seldom penalizes serious corporate and management malfeasance — out of some misguided notion that to do so would cause stock prices to fall, shareholders to suffer and confidence to be undermined. Preserving confidence, even when that confidence is false, has been near the top of the S.E.C.’s agenda.

IT’S not hard to see why the S.E.C. behaves as it does. If you work for the enforcement division of the S.E.C. you probably know in the back of your mind, and in the front too, that if you maintain good relations with Wall Street you might soon be paid huge sums of money to be employed by it.

The commission’s most recent director of enforcement is the general counsel at JPMorgan Chase; the enforcement chief before him became general counsel at Deutsche Bank; and one of his predecessors became a managing director for Credit Suisse before moving on to Morgan Stanley. A casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the whole point of landing the job as the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement is to position oneself for the better paying one on Wall Street.

At the back of the version of Harry Markopolos’s brave paper currently making the rounds is a copy of an e-mail message, dated April 2, 2008, from Mr. Markopolos to Jonathan S. Sokobin. Mr. Sokobin was then the new head of the commission’s office of risk assessment, a job that had been vacant for more than a year after its previous occupant had left to — you guessed it — take a higher-paying job on Wall Street.

At any rate, Mr. Markopolos clearly hoped that a new face might mean a new ear — one that might be receptive to the truth. He phoned Mr. Sokobin and then sent him his paper. “Attached is a submission I’ve made to the S.E.C. three times in Boston,” he wrote. “Each time Boston sent this to New York. Meagan Cheung, branch chief, in New York actually investigated this but with no result that I am aware of. In my conversations with her, I did not believe that she had the derivatives or mathematical background to understand the violations.”

How does this happen? How can the person in charge of assessing Wall Street firms not have the tools to understand them? Is the S.E.C. that inept? Perhaps, but the problem inside the commission is far worse — because inept people can be replaced. The problem is systemic. The new director of risk assessment was no more likely to grasp the risk of Bernard Madoff than the old director of risk assessment because the new guy’s thoughts and beliefs were guided by the same incentives: the need to curry favor with the politically influential and the desire to keep sweet the Wall Street elite.

And here’s the most incredible thing of all: 18 months into the most spectacular man-made financial calamity in modern experience, nothing has been done to change that, or any of the other bad incentives that led us here in the first place.

SAY what you will about our government’s approach to the financial crisis, you cannot accuse it of wasting its energy being consistent or trying to win over the masses. In the past year there have been at least seven different bailouts, and six different strategies. And none of them seem to have pleased anyone except a handful of financiers.

When Bear Stearns failed, the government induced JPMorgan Chase to buy it by offering a knockdown price and guaranteeing Bear Stearns’s shakiest assets. Bear Stearns bondholders were made whole and its stockholders lost most of their money.

Then came the collapse of the government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both promptly nationalized. Management was replaced, shareholders badly diluted, creditors left intact but with some uncertainty. Next came Lehman Brothers, which was, of course, allowed to go bankrupt. At first, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve claimed they had allowed Lehman to fail in order to signal that recklessly managed Wall Street firms did not all come with government guarantees; but then, when chaos ensued, and people started saying that letting Lehman fail was a dumb thing to have done, they changed their story and claimed they lacked the legal authority to rescue the firm.

But then a few days later A.I.G. failed, or tried to, yet was given the gift of life with enormous government loans. Washington Mutual and Wachovia promptly followed: the first was unceremoniously seized by the Treasury, wiping out both its creditors and shareholders; the second was batted around for a bit. Initially, the Treasury tried to persuade Citigroup to buy it — again at a knockdown price and with a guarantee of the bad assets. (The Bear Stearns model.) Eventually, Wachovia went to Wells Fargo, after the Internal Revenue Service jumped in and sweetened the pot with a tax subsidy.

In the middle of all this, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. persuaded Congress that he needed $700 billion to buy distressed assets from banks — telling the senators and representatives that if they didn’t give him the money the stock market would collapse. Once handed the money, he abandoned his promised strategy, and instead of buying assets at market prices, began to overpay for preferred stocks in the banks themselves. Which is to say that he essentially began giving away billions of dollars to Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and a few others unnaturally selected for survival. The stock market fell anyway.

It’s hard to know what Mr. Paulson was thinking as he never really had to explain himself, at least not in public. But the general idea appears to be that if you give the banks capital they will in turn use it to make loans in order to stimulate the economy. Never mind that if you want banks to make smart, prudent loans, you probably shouldn’t give money to bankers who sunk themselves by making a lot of stupid, imprudent ones. If you want banks to re-lend the money, you need to provide them not with preferred stock, which is essentially a loan, but with tangible common equity — so that they might write off their losses, resolve their troubled assets and then begin to make new loans, something they won’t be able to do until they’re confident in their own balance sheets. But as it happened, the banks took the taxpayer money and just sat on it.

57 2009-01-04 “It’s been pretty crazy,” he said. “The only thing I’m missing is quality time with my wife, and sleep.”

Mullen added with a chuckle that he had it easy compared with his wife, Megan, who is expecting their first child.

“That poor gal,” he said. “She’s seven and a half months pregnant, trying to sell a home, buy a home and pack up our lives. She’s got to entertain some family at the national championship game and get ready to be a head coach’s wife at Mississippi State. Her stress is a little bit more than mine.”

For nearly two weeks, Florida fans were stressed about whether Mullen would be calling plays in the national title game. Coach Urban Meyer and Mullen did not make an immediate decision because they were busy with recruiting.

Mullen said there was not much doubt that he would take part in Thursday’s game, but he and Meyer wanted to reach an agreement before going public. Mullen consulted with Bo Pelini, who coached Louisiana State’s defense in the title game last year after accepting the job as Nebraska’s coach.

“It’s gone like I would imagine, very professional,” Meyer said of Mullen’s dual role. “But it’s not 100 percent for Florida; he’s employed by Mississippi State. However, he’s committed to this team.”

Mullen has forged an especially close bond with Gators quarterback Tim Tebow, as the two watch hours of film together every Sunday and hum along to Mullen’s favorite band, U2.

Tebow, a junior, said he would miss Mullen, who teased him about Florida’s trip to Starkville for a game next season. The first time they met after he took the Mississippi State job was a bit surreal, Mullen said, because they are so close. But their schedules have returned to normal for the final game.

“He’s focused and he’s ready to go,” Tebow said. “He’s got a lot on his plate, but his No. 1 priority is this game right now.”

Meyer did not waste time in promoting his longtime assistant Steve Addazio to offensive coordinator. Scott Loeffler, who has worked as an assistant with Michigan and the Detroit Lions, is the leading candidate to become the quarterbacks coach, a title Mullen also held.

Meyer said Addazio’s promotion ensured that the Gators would “keep it going” with their success on offense.

“There was no decision at all,” Meyer said. “It was done a long time ago.”

Before this season, Mullen had never even received a phone call about a job from another college or an N.F.L. team. As quarterbacks coach at Utah, he had helped Alex Smith become a Heisman finalist and a No. 1 pick in the N.F.L. draft. At Florida, he called plays in the Gators’ national title game victory over Ohio State and helped Tebow become the first sophomore to win the Heisman last season.

Mullen now has a program of his own, which he called an “unbelievable opportunity.” As his cellphones keep buzzing, he is embracing his dual roles.

“I’m out in Starkville, and there’s the adrenaline rush of a new staff and putting all that together, and that’s all I can think about,” Mullen said. “And I’m sitting in game-planning meetings for the national championship in Gainesville, and that’s all I can think about. The adrenaline will keep me going through the game, and I hope to find a way to keep it going through signing day.”

By then, he will have to keep track of only one phone.
58 2009-01-04 Graduate school can also be a way to reinvent yourself. If you have previously thought of going in another direction, now may be the time to do so, said Sean O’Neil, a principal of One to One Leadership, a recruiting and leadership training firm in Pelham, N.Y.

You will need contacts in any new profession, and graduate programs can help connect you with alumni working in that field, said Eileen Kohan, executive director of the career planning and placement center at the University of Southern California.

Regardless of your motivation, carefully consider your personal financial situation before making a decision. Graduate school isn’t cheap. If your portfolio is down and cash reserves are short, it may not be a wise choice right now. Many students pay for their tuition with federal and private loans. Individual schools and certain organizations — such as local bar associations, fraternities and sororities, social clubs and veterans groups — may offer scholarships and grants based on merit, financial need or both.

Ask yourself how much more marketable you will be after getting the degree. What do jobs in this industry pay for those with a master’s degree? And is the industry growing or shrinking? “You need to figure out what the return on your investment is going to be,” Mr. O’Neil said. “Before I did leadership training I got a master’s in social work. That was a guaranteed negative return because it’s a career that just doesn’t pay well.”

Q. If you want to move into a new field, how do you decide what to study?

A. You may be want to explore the “road not taken” — a career that previously appealed to you but that you never had a chance to pursue.

Still, be realistic. Take a hard look at which areas in the economy are hiring and where the need for workers is growing, like science, health care and accounting, said Bernadette Kenny, chief career officer at Adecco Group North America, a human resources consulting firm.

Join professional associations and do some research on their Web sites to learn about hiring trends and industry leaders, Ms. Kohan said. “You don’t want to go into another industry that is about to go belly up,” she said.

Q. Might some employers view going to graduate school as a way of “hiding out” during the recession?

A. Because this recession is worse than any in recent memory, there is a common acceptance among employers that people are having a tough time finding jobs, especially in finance, said Mr. Heath, and graduate school most likely won’t be seen as an escape hatch.

Still, the decision has to make sense for your larger career goals. “The burden is going to be on you to prove to potential employers you didn’t just do this because you lost your job,” said Anna Ivey, president of the career counseling firm Ivey Consulting in Boston. “Either a degree makes sense for you or it doesn’t,” she said. “The only thing a layoff affects is your timing.”

Q. Will you face stiff competition for admission because others who are unemployed are also heading back to school?

A. Yes, because people often choose to ride out a recession in graduate school. All four previous United States recessions declared since 1980 have corresponded with an upswing in the number of Graduate Management Admissions Tests that are taken. The test is used to gain admission to M.B.A. programs.

“That’s something applicants have going against them — sheer volume — which makes it much tougher to get in,” Ms. Ivey said.

Q. If you do decide to go back to school, should you attend full time, or on nights and weekends?

A. Much depends on whether or not you can manage without a paycheck for two years. Attending part time takes longer, but gives you the flexibility to look for work during the day and take a new job, even a part-time one, Mr. Heath said.

For many graduate degrees, attending full time or part time doesn’t affect how employers perceive the degree. But for some — like an M.B.A. or a law degree — full-time programs at top schools have a pedigree that is more attractive to employers. “And daytime programs are where a school’s career resource efforts and recruiting programs are focused,” Mr. O’Neil said.
59 2009-01-04 An article on Dec. 21 about nepotism referred imprecisely to research on Belding’s ground squirrels by the evolutionary biologist Paul Sherman. The squirrels call out long warning trills preferentially to close kin when a terrestrial predator is near. The squirrels also call out warnings when hawks are around, but generally without regard to kinship. (In citing Dr. Sherman’s work for the article, Dr. Frank J. Sulloway had said that the squirrels call out the nepotistic warnings when a hawk is circling overhead. Dr. Sulloway alerted The Times to the error after the article had gone to press.)
60 2009-01-04 A new report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation presents the case for investing $30 billion in the nation’s digital infrastructure, including health information technology, broadband Internet access and the so-called smart grid, an effort to infuse detailed digital intelligence into the electricity distribution grid.

The stimulus money, he says, is “a wonderful opportunity” to integrate innovative technologies at a far faster pace than would otherwise be possible. “You’d have an economy and society within three to four years that would be a lot better than we have today,” Mr. Atkinson says, “and you’d create a lot of jobs.”

Beyond direct stimulus investments, he supports an initiative being circulated in Silicon Valley that seeks an information technology investment tax credit to foster innovation through the downturn.

Citing an Op-Ed essay on Nov. 30 in The New York Times by the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Silicon Valley petition calls for a tax credit for companies that spend more than 80 percent of what they had been spending annually on information technology like computers and software.

The petition’s creator is David Thompson, the chief executive of Genius.com. “I think it’s great that they want to build more highways and bridges,” Mr. Thompson says, “but if you really want to invest in long-term job viability you need to invest in the innovation economy.”

Various organizations have previously backed such a tax credit specifically for clean technologies, biotech and broadband development. But TechNet, an advocacy group for the technology industry, is pushing for a tax credit that would underwrite innovation more broadly.

“Innovation is the lifeblood of the American economy,” says Jim Hock, a spokesman for TechNet. “We’re only as good as our next innovation. TechNet believes we shouldn’t be picking and choosing technologies to back with a tax credit. We should be technology-neutral and create an atmosphere of innovation that will let a thousand flowers bloom.”

Mr. Stiglitz, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997, noted in an interview that there has been a slow divergence between traditional economics and what may be called innovation economics.

“I’ve been a bit astonished that all the discussion around the private-sector stimulus has centered on infrastructure,” he said. “Bailouts, too, are aimed at correcting mistakes of the past, so they are backward-looking. We would be much better off spending our money forward-looking. If we spend $700 billion on new technology and innovation, we’d have a stronger, new, real economy. Up to now, the discussion has focused on the sectors that have been mismanaged rather than the sectors that are creating our future.”

Geoffrey A. Moore, a partner with Mohr Davidow Ventures and author of five best-selling business books, says that whatever form the government stimulus takes, it must focus on the nation’s greatest strength.

“America is probably the best culture in the world at failing,” he said. “We’re willing to navigate in a fog and keep moving forward. Our competitive advantage tends to be at the fuzzy front end of things when you’re still finding your way. Once the way has been found, we’re back at a disadvantage. So, yes, investing in innovation is critical.”
61 2009-01-04 “What Raman does is amazing,” said Paul Schroeder, vice president for programs and policy at the American Foundation for the Blind, which conducts research on technology that can help visually impaired people. “He is a leading thinker on accessibility issues, and his capacity to design and alter technology to meet his needs is unique.”

Some of Mr. Raman’s innovations may help make electronic gadgets and Web services more user-friendly for everyone. Instead of asking how something should work if a person cannot see, he says he prefers to ask, “How should something work when the user is not looking at the screen?”

Such systems could prove useful for drivers or anyone else who could benefit from eyes-free access to a phone. They could also appeal to aging baby boomers with fading vision who want to keep using technology they’ve come to depend on.

Mr. Raman’s approach reflects a recognition that many innovations designed primarily for people with disabilities have benefited the broader public, said Larry Goldberg, who oversees the National Center for Accessible Media at WGBH, the public broadcasting station in Boston. They include curb cuts for wheelchairs, captions for television broadcasts and optical character-recognition technology, which was fine-tuned to create software that could read printed books aloud and is now used in many computer applications, he said.

With no buttons to guide the fingers on its glassy surface, the touch-screen cellphone may seem a particularly daunting challenge. But Mr. Raman said that with the right tweaks, touch-screen phones — many of which already come equipped with GPS technology and a compass — could help blind people navigate the world.

“How much of a leap of faith does it take for you to realize that your phone could say, ‘Walk straight and within 200 feet you’ll get to the intersection of X and Y,’ ” Mr. Raman said. “This is entirely doable.”

ADVOCATES for the blind have long complained that technology companies have done a generally poor job of making their products accessible. The Web, while opening many opportunities for blind people, is still riddled with obstacles. And sophisticated screen-reader software, which turns documents and Web pages into synthesized speech, can cost more than $1,000. Even with a screen reader, many sites are hard to navigate.

Last year, the National Federation of the Blind reached a settlement of a landmark class-action lawsuit against one company whose site advocates found unusable, Target. In the settlement, the retailer agreed to make its Web site accessible to blind people. The federation assesses the usability of Web sites and currently certifies only a handful as being fully accessible.

One challenge is that technology often evolves much faster than the guidelines that ensure Web sites work well with screen readers. In December, the World Wide Web Consortium, an Internet standards group, released Version 2.0 of its accessibility guidelines for Web sites. The previous version dated back to 1999, when the Web consisted largely of static Web pages rather than interactive applications.

Obstacles on the Web take many forms. A common one is the Captcha, a security feature consisting of a string of distorted letters and numbers that users are supposed to read and retype before they register for a new service or send e-mail. Few Web sites offer audio Captchas.

Some pages are just poorly designed, like e-commerce sites where the “checkout” button is an image that isn’t labeled so screen readers can find it.

“The overwhelming percentage of the industry really hasn’t stepped up to the plate to provide the blindness community with equal access to their products,” said Eric Bridges, director of advocacy and governmental affairs at the American Council of the Blind. Mr. Bridges and other advocates argue that accessibility should be built into new technologies, not added as an afterthought.

People with other disabilities face similar challenges on the Internet. “On the deafness side, the frustration is huge because of all of the video out there without captions,” Mr. Goldberg said.

MR. RAMAN, who before joining Google in 2005 worked at Adobe Systems and as a researcher at I.B.M., is intimately familiar with accessibility problems, both personally and professionally. In 2006, he developed a version of Google’s search engine that gives a slight preference to Web sites that work well with screen readers. The system had to test millions of Web pages.

“You wouldn’t have found a single page that fully complied with the accessibility guidelines,” Mr. Raman said. Still, the system could detect which pages worked reasonably well with screen readers.

The service is not being used as widely as he had hoped. Still, it has had an impact. Several Web site operators whose sites weren’t showing up prominently in Google search results asked Mr. Raman how they could fix their sites so they would rank better.

The service includes a screen magnifier that enlarges individual search results. Mr. Raman says the feature is intended to help low-vision users, but it could also prove useful to a much larger population, especially on cellphones and other devices with small screens.

For his own use, he has built a highly customized system that allows him efficient access to much of what he needs on his PC and on the Web, stripping out anything that could slow him down. For instance, the system goes directly to the article text on the news sites he reads regularly, bypassing navigational links and other features found on most Web pages.

On a recent day, Mr. Raman was working on a research paper about the future structure of the Web. A monitor hung above the desk. It is usually turned off, unless he wants to show a colleague or visitor what he is working on. He typed at his keyboard, his head slightly tilted to one side, listening to his screen reader through a pair of wireless headphones.

The screen reader is calibrated to speak at roughly triple the speed of a normal voice. To the untrained ear, the output is incomprehensible, but it allows Mr. Raman to “read” at roughly the same speed as a sighted person.

Processing information quickly is a skill he has developed over the years: a video on YouTube shows him solving his Braille Rubik’s Cube in 23 seconds. When he is not typing, Mr. Raman, who wears large sunglasses, is often folding and unfolding pieces of paper into tiny, origami-like geometrical shapes at prodigious speed.

He shares a work area at Google with Charles Chen, a 25-year-old engineer, and Hubbell, Mr. Raman’s guide dog. (Hubbell has his own Web site.)

Mr. Chen, who is sighted, developed a free screen reader for Web pages that works with the Firefox browser. Working together, the two recently added keyboard shortcuts that help blind and low-vision users navigate quickly through Google’s search results. They’ve also developed tools to make sophisticated Web applications, like e-mail and blog readers, suitable for screen-reading software.

Now, much of their effort is focused on touch-screen phones.

“The thing I am most interested in is all of the stuff moving to the mobile world, because it is a big life-changer,” Mr. Raman said.

To show their progress, Mr. Raman pulled his T-Mobile G1, a touch-screen phone with Google’s Android software, from a pocket of his jeans. He and Mr. Chen have already outfitted it with software that speaks much like a screen reader on a PC. Now they are working on ways to allow blind people, or anyone who is not looking at the screen, to enter text, numbers and commands.

That development would complement voice-recognition systems, which are not always reliable and don’t work well in noisy environments.

Since he cannot precisely hit a button on a touch screen, Mr. Raman created a dialer that works based on relative positions. It interprets any place where he first touches the screen as a 5, the center of a regular telephone dial pad. To dial any other number, he simply slides his finger in its direction — up and to the left for 1, down and to the right for 9, and so on. If he makes a mistake, he can erase a digit simply by shaking the phone, which can detect motion.

He and Mr. Chen are testing several other input methods. None of these technologies have been rolled out, but Mr. Raman, who is already using the G1 as his primary cellphone, hopes to make them freely available soon.

What may become the most life-changing mobile technology — a phone that can recognize and read signs through its camera — may still be a few years away, Mr. Raman said. Already, some devices can read text this way. But because blind users don’t know where signs are, they can’t point the camera at them or align it properly, Mr. Raman said. Once chips become powerful enough, they will be able to detect a sign’s location and read skewed type, he said.

“Those things will happen,” he said. When they do, sighted users will benefit, too.

“If you have the technology that can recognize a street sign as you drive by it, that is helpful for everyone,” he said. “In a foreign country, it will translate it.”

Mr. Raman’s innovations have already made their way onto millions of PCs. At Adobe in the 1990s, he helped to adapt the PDF format so it could be read by screen readers. That was required for PDF to be used by the federal government, and it eventually led to the technology’s being embraced as a global standard for electronic documents.

“It was incredibly important to us as a business, and to the blind,” said John Warnock, the chairman and founder of Adobe.

Mr. Raman says he thinks he has the largest impact when he can persuade other engineers to make their products accessible — or, better yet, when he can convince them that there are interesting problems to be solved in this area. “If I can get another 10 engineers motivated to work on accessibility,” he said, “it is a huge win.”
62 2009-01-04 “American designers took the Depression as a call to arms,” said Kristina Wilson, author of “Livable Modernism: Interior Decorating and Design During the Great Depression” and an assistant professor of art history at Clark University. “It was a chance to make good on the Modernist promise to make affordable, intelligent design for a broad audience.”

The most popular American designer of that era was probably Russel Wright, who acted as the Depression’s Martha Stewart, turning out a warmed-up, affordable version of European modern furniture, tableware and linens for a new kind of informal home life. A bentwood armchair cost $19.95. “They were not just cheap, they were beautiful, and that was a powerful combination,” Ms. Wilson said.

Design tends to thrive in hard times. In the scarcity of the 1940s, Charles and Ray Eames produced furniture and other products of enduring appeal from cheap materials like plastic, resin and plywood, and Italian design flowered in the aftermath of World War II.

Will today’s designers rise to the occasion? “What designers do really well is work within constraints, work with what they have,” said Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. “This might be the time when designers can really do their job, and do it in a humanistic spirit.”

In the lean years ahead, “there will be less design, but much better design,” Ms. Antonelli predicted.

There is a reason she and others are optimistic: however dark the economic picture, it will most likely cause designers to shift their attention from consumer products to the more pressing needs of infrastructure, housing, city planning, transit and energy. Designers are good at coming up with new ways of looking at complex problems, and if President-elect Barack Obama delivers anything like a W.P.A, we could be “standing on the brink of one of the most productive periods of design ever,” said Reed Kroloff, director of Cranbrook Academy of Art.

On the other hand, the design community talked up its role in safeguarding the world after 9/11, with little result.

Modernism’s great ambition was to democratize design. Ikea and Target have shown that the battle for cheap design can be won. The emphasis will most likely shift to greater quality at affordable prices. This time around it will be the designer’s job to discourage consumers from regarding that $30 Ikea side table as a throwaway item.

If household furnishings are to avoid landfills, says Julie Lasky, editor in chief of I.D. magazine, they must be capable of withstanding the vicissitudes of fashion — like the Aalto stool, but at a fifth of the price. “It will be about finding the sweet spot between affordability and durability,” Ms. Lasky said. This kind of innovation means rethinking the economy of production and distribution so that goods are made cheaply closer to home (or in the home, if the most radical ideas are to be taken seriously).

One way or another, design will focus less on styling consumer objects with laser-cut patterns and colored resin and more on the intelligent reworking of current conditions. Expect to hear a lot more about open-source design, and cradle-to-cradle, a concept developed by William McDonough and Michael Braungart that calls for cars, packaging and other everyday objects to be designed specifically for recycling so that their parts and materials are used and reused without waste.

The old paradigm — epitomized by shelter magazines like Architectural Digest and Dwell — that found romance in single-family homes, each with its own lawn, detached garage and septic system, may crumble under the weight of its wastefulness. One challenge will be for designers to coax us to a more efficient way of living, as the architect Lorcan O’Herlihy is doing with his light and airy schemes for multifamily dwellings in Los Angeles, a city where backyards and driveways are all but a birthright. Fewer buildings will go up, and the stock of mid-century buildings nearing the end of their lifespan will be thoughtfully reworked to make them efficient and in keeping with principles of sustainability.

If Ms. Linning’s dangling from the ceiling was a cultural moment now passed, we can look forward to others for an age in which beauty and austerity go together.
63 2009-01-04 A two-state treaty could follow, and then perhaps peace between Israel and Syria, leaving Iran isolated behind the buffer of a newly democratic and peaceful, if not particularly friendly, Iraq.

Iran is the one country — aside from Israel — with the most at stake in the outcome. It sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah not only to torment Israel but also to spread its influence in the Arab world. A convincing defeat of Hamas would undercut that strategy, and presumably Iran’s ability to resist Western pressure in any broad bargaining — for example, over its support for terrorist groups and even its nuclear program. “It’s an ambitious scenario,” said Mr. Indyk, with a sobering caveat, “that would require things to get significantly worse before they could get better.”

But Israel’s attacks also could fail outright, and history suggests that as the more likely scenario, Middle East experts across the political spectrum said.

The strikes — and the Arab anger over scenes of death and destruction — have highlighted divisions in the Middle East that can prevent Arab nations from working with Israel.

Of course, Egypt, whose peace treaty with Israel is anathema to militants in the Middle East, kept its border to Gaza largely shut last week, and its president, Hosni Mubarak, quarreled openly with the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant Shiite group that now shares power in Lebanon. And at a meeting of the Arab League, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister gently and indirectly rebuked Hamas for provoking the conflict. Those actions were in line with Israeli dreams. But the attacks also subjected the regimes in Egypt and other moderate Arab nations to blistering scorn from inflamed Arab populations.

And that widened the rifts between rulers and citizens in countries nominally allied with the United States and willing to deal with Israel. The longer this goes on, the more likely it is that regional tensions will intensify. The images of carnage could fuel new hatreds and radicalize some who felt that peace talks offer more hope than resistance.

In some ways, the Gaza attacks were reminiscent of the gamble Israel took, and largely lost, in Lebanon in 1982. It invaded to eliminate the threat of Yasir Arafat’s forces, which were then encamped on its northern border. It accomplished that goal, driving Mr. Arafat into exile in Tunis, and eventually he recognized Israel and negotiated. But in the meantime, a new and virulently anti-Israel threat was born in Lebanon in the form of Hezbollah. Israel’s northern border remained insecure, and Iran’s influence grew.

Now Mr. Abbas, already deeply mired in a rivalry with Hamas, could find himself further isolated from Palestinian sentiment the longer the Israeli assaults continue. Signs were growing last week that the fighting was emboldening Palestinian resistance, prompting Mr. Abbas to say he was prepared to walk away from the peace process President Bush began in Annapolis, Md., in 2007.

“What does he have to offer us a year after Annapolis?” Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor, independent Palestinian legislator and advocate of democracy, said of Mr. Abbas, in a telephone conversation from the West Bank. “They promised us an agreement by the end of the year. What do we have after this year?”

Dr. Barghouti, who was a minister in the short-lived unity government that followed Hamas’s victory in 2006 elections, said the only durable solution was an accommodation that included Hamas. “There are two ways to deal with Hamas,” he said. “Either confront them, which makes them more extreme, or accept them in the political process.”

That would hearten Islamic militants in Egypt and Jordan and make those countries’ leaders shiver a bit more; and it would very likely embolden Iran in its ambitions for regional leadership and insistence on a nuclear program.

Most analysts expect that some sort of negotiated cease-fire with Hamas is inevitable, since Israel seems neither willing nor able to reoccupy Gaza and replace its leadership. That, then, would leave the group with many followers in Gaza, even if its ranks are badly battered, its leaders driven underground and its formal centers of power, through which it might deliver services to its people, are destroyed by Israeli bombs. “Hamas as an institution is not really sustaining casualties,” said Ziad Asali, president of the American Task Force for Palestine. “The people of Gaza are the ones who are paying the price.”

Daniel Levy, an Israeli analyst with the New America Foundation here, said the flaw in the Israeli strategy is the belief that that people in Gaza will blame their own government, and not the Israelis, for the new wave of violence.

Israel, for its part, is determined to avoid the military and political catastrophe of its incursion in Lebanon in 2006 to squelch cross-border rocket attacks by Hezbollah not all that different from the ones by Hamas. That fight ended with a United Nations resolution and international peacekeepers but also, eventually, a rearmed Hezbollah.

“Israel believes its deterrence was lost in that war,” David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote on Wednesday, “and Israel’s current campaign against Hamas should be seen as an effort to regain that deterrence.”

One lesson Israel learned from Lebanon, he argued, was to lower expectations, depriving Hamas of the chance to declare victory simply by surviving the Israeli assault, as Hezbollah did. Israel has done that by remaining vague about its final goals. Israel also seems to have prepared better; by all appearances its forces were following a methodical campaign of strikes, even as it tried to win the propaganda war — or at least to do less badly this time, by trying to minimize civilian casualties.

Almost everyone in Washington agrees that the timing of the latest crisis had at least one benefit: It came before the inauguration of Mr. Obama on Jan. 20. Although he has expressed staunch support for Israel — at one point justifying a response to Hamas rocket attacks — he has raised expectations of a change in policy in the Middle East. The fighting has certainly pushed the Arab-Israeli conflict back to the front of a United States agenda crowded with foreign crises, from Iran to India to North Korea.

It is likely that the immediate fighting will have ended by Inauguration Day. If so, President Obama will be able to capitalize on the cease-fire to renew a push for a permanent settlement. He once suggested throwing American weight behind regional talks that would include Hamas, but that may no longer be a possibility. Mr. Bush fiercely resisted any accommodation with a group the United States and European Union classify as a terrorist organization.

“He has one advantage: that this is happening now,” said Mr. Asali of the American Task Force for Palestine. “The passionate reactions, the emotional reactions, the hatred, et cetera, et cetera, will be directed at the present administration rather than the next one. But that is a slight silver lining.”

66 2009-01-04 The car G.M. engineers used as a development mule was an Eldorado from the last year of production before the model was drastically downsized for the ’79 model year. Its huge V-8 piston engine was replaced by a gas turbine engine, fed from a small coal bin under the hood.

Attempts to adapt turbine engines to automobiles go back to at least to the 1950s, a time when aircraft jet engines — a type of turbine usually called a turbofan — were beginning to sweep aside piston power in the skies.

The effect on styling trends moved even faster than the engine technology.

Jet-inspired styling, at least in the public’s eye, seemed to take hold overnight; common objects like children’s toys and appliances borrowed the design theme of fighter planes and airliners. While jet styling influenced cars with meaningless froufrou like the air intake at the front of the 1951 Buick Le Sabre show car and the hood ornament of the 1955 Chevrolet, some in Detroit’s engineering community thought the engine technology might have application for speeding travel along the country’s new Interstate highway system.

G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation each devoted considerable research effort to turbine technology. Turbine-powered design studies included three versions of the wildly finned Firebirds that G.M. took on the show circuit in the 1950s. Chrysler went so far as to produce 50 turbine cars, with bodies by Ghia, in 1963. The cars were used in a consumer evaluation fleet to gather real-world reaction and experience with the experimental powertrain.

Development continued well into the 1970s, as G.M. and Chrysler worked independently to optimize turbine benefits that included longer engine life, lower maintenance, negligible oil consumption, low weight and nearly vibration-free operation. Challenges included the engine’s high internal temperatures, its thirstiness in low-speed operation and the need to improve drivability for operators accustomed to V-8 power.

Paul Ulrich, one of the early members of G.M.’s turbine team, said the company pulled its top engineers into the program. “Back in the ’70s, the corporation genuinely thought that we were going to run out of fuel, and soon, so identifying potential alternative powertrains and fuels was critical,” said Mr. Ulrich, who is now retired.

G.M.’s research efforts grew under the direction of Albert H. Bell III, executive engineer of the advanced product staff, who had been hired away from Chrysler to lead the turbine engine program in the mid-1960s. Mr. Bell died in 2000.

Turbine engines can run on nearly any hydrocarbon, including gasoline, methanol, ethanol or diesel fuel, but ample American coal reserves prompted engineers to consider it as a fuel. Additionally, the higher energy content of solid coal compared with its liquid derivatives — a form used extensively by Germany in World War II — gave G.M.’s engineers a good reason to pursue development of a turbine that could burn the solid form.

“We were able to obtain finely powdered coal — a dust, really — that was so fine that when you rubbed it between your fingers it turned greasy,” Mr. Ulrich explained.

The coal was stored in the engine compartment, a feat made possible by the Eldorado’s apartment-sized space under the hood. The fuel delivery system, as described by John Schult, an engineer who worked on the project in the early 1980s, was something of a Rube Goldberg contraption.

“To keep the coal dust ready for delivery to the engine, it had to be continuously agitated,” he said. “Then a small conveyor belt delivered the coal to the gasifier,” the first section of G.M.’s automotive turbine engine. “When you stepped on the gas pedal, it actually moved a potentiometer that varied the speed of the coal conveyor belt. More fuel resulted in more power.”

The car was not jetlike to drive. “Any of the turbines we had running back then suffered from some throttle lag compared to the V-8 engines,” Mr. Schult said. “The coal-powered turbine had extra delay due to the fuel’s transport system. But turbine engines make excellent torque at low engine speeds, so once the engine did respond, the car launched pretty well.”

Compared with a piston engine that normally operates at 800-6,000 revolutions per minute, the G.M. turbines idled at 35,000 r.p.m., easily ran at 65,000 r.p.m. and could withstand 90,000 r.p.m. For that reason, a gear reduction system was added to the turbine engine, finally connecting to a conventional G.M. three-speed automatic transmission. While the engine and fuel were experimental, the engineers tried to use as many production parts as possible to keep costs down and to ease the task of possibly putting the car into production.

Mr. Schult also recalled the unusual starting procedure and sound of the Eldorado. “The engine started using diesel fuel, and then once running it switched over automatically to the coal,” he said. “The sound was unique, that characteristic whine of a jet engine. And then there was the constant high-frequency buzz of the agitator that kept the coal dust ready for delivery, overlaid with the noise of the compressed air system that blew the coal from the conveyor into the gasifier. It didn’t sound anything like a regular car engine.”

General Motors built only one coal-fired passenger car, Mr. Schult said. The experiment proved it could be done but, he added, was “too exotic to be practical at that time.”

In addition, the refueling was messy. Mr. Schult recalled that the dust was hard to contain, coating everything in the lab, and it was difficult to clean up.

According to Mr. Ulrich and Mr. Schult, G.M. continued to develop passenger-car turbine engines into the 1990s, when it transferred the program to Allison, the company that built the turbine engine.

“By this time, the corporation had come to believe that fuel cells would be a better engineering solution to pursue, so they shifted company resources,” Mr. Ulrich said. “And our group was bumping up against gargantuan issues. Operating temps and nitrogen oxides in the exhaust were problematic.”

When the Eldorado was shown to journalists in 1981, G.M.’s vice chairman, Howard H. Kehrl, promised that coal-powered vehicles would be “products of the next century.” Nearly three decades later, Mr. Schult says that the technology is achievable, though not promising.

Ceramic technology has advanced enough to deal with the heat issues of passenger car turbines, and exhaust after-treatment systems similar to those in the latest diesel engines could address the powertrain’s difficulty in controlling exhaust emissions, Mr. Schult said. But the hurdles of creating a coal dust refueling infrastructure remain formidable.

As for what happened to the 1978 Eldorado with the coal-burning engine, Mr. Ulrich said that when G.M. transferred the program’s assets to Allison, the turbine maker, the Cadillac was shipped off, too. Its fate could not be determined.

The notion of a turbine-powered Cadillac did not disappear with that car. In 2006 Jay Leno’s garage, with design assistance from G.M.’s styling studio, built a Cadillac-badged concept car called the Ecojet, powered by a 650-horsepower Honeywell turbine. But in tune with the times, it burned biodiesel fuel.
67 2009-01-04 David Paulson, the Solano County district attorney, is prosecuting Vacaville Ford-Mercury for similar fraud involving an as-yet-undetermined number of consumers. A lawyer for Vacaville Ford-Mercury did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

Ms. Foley is not alone in her predicament, said Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a consumer group in Sacramento. She said that over the last year many consumers had experienced such problems with dealerships.

Of course, dealers themselves are having problems. About 900 went out of business last year, and at least that many may close in 2009, said Paul Taylor, the chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.

That prediction worries consumer advocates like Bradford Phelps, a senior assistant attorney general in Arkansas who sued McKay Hyundai in Pine Bluff. The suit, filed in 2007 in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, charges that the dealership violated consumer protection laws by not paying off loans or by selling nonexistent extended warranties to at least 40 people.

“There is a real fear out there that this could happen again, and when it does happen it has devastating consequences for consumers,” Mr. Phelps said.

James E. Smith Jr., a lawyer representing McKay, said it would be improper to comment on a pending case.

Consumers can get hurt in either of two ways, Ms. Shahan said. One is being forced to make payments not only on a new vehicle, but also on the vehicle that was traded in, because the consumer would still be the legal owner if the dealership did not pay off the loan. Or, if consumers bought a used car they can wind up like Ms. Foley, unable to get the title because the previous owner’s loan had not been paid off.

Mr. Kemnitzer and Mr. Phelps said the banks that made loans for the dealerships have some legal responsibility. That raises the possibility that consumers may get some help, although it may require litigation.

Mr. Phelps said some banks had been willing to let Arkansas consumers off the hook by handing over the title and accepting the loss.

He recommended that anyone buying a used car insist on getting the title immediately and not accept a promise that it will be mailed.
68 2009-01-04 Another reason VaR is so appealing is that it can measure both individual risks — the amount of risk contained in a single trader’s portfolio, for instance — and firmwide risk, which it does by combining the VaRs of a given firm’s trading desks and coming up with a net number. Top executives usually know their firm’s daily VaR within minutes of the market’s close.

Risk managers use VaR to quantify their firm’s risk positions to their board. In the late 1990s, as the use of derivatives was exploding, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that firms had to include a quantitative disclosure of market risks in their financial statements for the convenience of investors, and VaR became the main tool for doing so. Around the same time, an important international rule-making body, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, went even further to validate VaR by saying that firms and banks could rely on their own internal VaR calculations to set their capital requirements. So long as their VaR was reasonably low, the amount of money they had to set aside to cover risks that might go bad could also be low.

Given the calamity that has since occurred, there has been a great deal of talk, even in quant circles, that this widespread institutional reliance on VaR was a terrible mistake. At the very least, the risks that VaR measured did not include the biggest risk of all: the possibility of a financial meltdown. “Risk modeling didn’t help as much as it should have,” says Aaron Brown, a former risk manager at Morgan Stanley who now works at AQR, a big quant-oriented hedge fund. A risk consultant named Marc Groz says, “VaR is a very limited tool.” David Einhorn, who founded Greenlight Capital, a prominent hedge fund, wrote not long ago that VaR was “relatively useless as a risk-management tool and potentially catastrophic when its use creates a false sense of security among senior managers and watchdogs. This is like an air bag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident.” Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the best-selling author of “The Black Swan,” has crusaded against VaR for more than a decade. He calls it, flatly, “a fraud.”

How then do we account for that story that made the rounds in the summer of 2007? It concerns Goldman Sachs, the one Wall Street firm that was not, at that time, taking a hit for billions of dollars of suddenly devalued mortgage-backed securities. Reporters wanted to understand how Goldman had somehow sidestepped the disaster that had befallen everyone else. What they discovered was that in December 2006, Goldman’s various indicators, including VaR and other risk models, began suggesting that something was wrong. Not hugely wrong, mind you, but wrong enough to warrant a closer look.

“We look at the P.& L. of our businesses every day,” said Goldman Sachs’ chief financial officer, David Viniar, when I went to see him recently to hear the story for myself. (P.& L. stands for profit and loss.) “We have lots of models here that are important, but none are more important than the P.& L., and we check every day to make sure our P.& L. is consistent with where our risk models say it should be. In December our mortgage business lost money for 10 days in a row. It wasn’t a lot of money, but by the 10th day we thought that we should sit down and talk about it.”

So Goldman called a meeting of about 15 people, including several risk managers and the senior people on the various trading desks. They examined a thick report that included every trading position the firm held. For the next three hours, they pored over everything. They examined their VaR numbers and their other risk models. They talked about how the mortgage-backed securities market “felt.” “Our guys said that it felt like it was going to get worse before it got better,” Viniar recalled. “So we made a decision: let’s get closer to home.”

In trading parlance, “getting closer to home” means reining in the risk, which in this case meant either getting rid of the mortgage-backed securities or hedging the positions so that if they declined in value, the hedges would counteract the loss with an equivalent gain. Goldman did both. And that’s why, back in the summer of 2007, Goldman Sachs avoided the pain that was being suffered by Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and the rest of Wall Street.

The story was told and retold in the business pages. But what did it mean, exactly? The question was always left hanging. Was it an example of the futility of risk modeling or its utility? Did it show that risk models, properly understood, were not a fraud after all but a potentially important signal that trouble was brewing? Or did it suggest instead that a handful of human beings at Goldman Sachs acted wisely by putting their models aside and making “decisions on more subjective degrees of belief about an uncertain future,” as Peter L. Bernstein put it in “Against the Gods?”

To put it in blunter terms, could VaR and the other risk models Wall Street relies on have helped prevent the financial crisis if only Wall Street paid better attention to them? Or did Wall Street’s reliance on them help lead us into the abyss?

One Saturday a few months ago, Taleb, a trim, impeccably dressed, middle-aged man — inexplicably, he won’t give his age — walked into a lobby in the Columbia Business School and headed for a classroom to give a guest lecture. Until that moment, the lobby was filled with students chatting and eating a quick lunch before the afternoon session began, but as soon as they saw Taleb, they streamed toward him, surrounding him and moving with him as he slowly inched his way up the stairs toward an already-crowded classroom. Those who couldn’t get in had to make do with the next classroom over, which had been set up as an overflow room. It was jammed, too.

It’s not every day that an options trader becomes famous by writing a book, but that’s what Taleb did, first with “Fooled by Randomness,” which was published in 2001 and became an immediate cult classic on Wall Street, and more recently with “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,” which came out in 2007 and landed on a number of best-seller lists. He also went from being primarily an options trader to what he always really wanted to be: a public intellectual. When I made the mistake of asking him one day whether he was an adjunct professor, he quickly corrected me. “I’m the Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at N.Y.U.,” he responded. “It’s the highest title they give in that department.” Humility is not among his virtues. On his Web site he has a link that reads, “Quotes from ‘The Black Swan’ that the imbeciles did not want to hear.”

“How many of you took statistics at Columbia?” he asked as he began his lecture. Most of the hands in the room shot up. “You wasted your money,” he sniffed. Behind him was a slide of Mickey Mouse that he had put up on the screen, he said, because it represented “Mickey Mouse probabilities.” That pretty much sums up his view of business-school statistics and probability courses.

Taleb’s ideas can be difficult to follow, in part because he uses the language of academic statisticians; words like “Gaussian,” “kurtosis” and “variance” roll off his tongue. But it’s also because he speaks in a kind of brusque shorthand, acting as if any fool should be able to follow his train of thought, which he can’t be bothered to fully explain.

“This is a Stan O’Neal trade,” he said, referring to the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. He clicked to a slide that showed a trade that made slow, steady profits — and then quickly spiraled downward for a giant, brutal loss.

“Why do people measure risks against events that took place in 1987?” he asked, referring to Black Monday, the October day when the U.S. market lost more than 20 percent of its value and has been used ever since as the worst-case scenario in many risk models. “Why is that a benchmark? I call it future-blindness.

“If you have a pilot flying a plane who doesn’t understand there can be storms, what is going to happen?” he asked. “He is not going to have a magnificent flight. Any small error is going to crash a plane. This is why the crisis that happened was predictable.”

Eventually, though, you do start to get the point. Taleb says that Wall Street risk models, no matter how mathematically sophisticated, are bogus; indeed, he is the leader of the camp that believes that risk models have done far more harm than good. And the essential reason for this is that the greatest risks are never the ones you can see and measure, but the ones you can’t see and therefore can never measure. The ones that seem so far outside the boundary of normal probability that you can’t imagine they could happen in your lifetime — even though, of course, they do happen, more often than you care to realize. Devastating hurricanes happen. Earthquakes happen. And once in a great while, huge financial catastrophes happen. Catastrophes that risk models somehow always manage to miss.

VaR is Taleb’s favorite case in point. The original VaR measured portfolio risk along what is called a “normal distribution curve,” a statistical measure that was first identified by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the early 1800s (hence the term “Gaussian”). It is a simple bell curve of the sort we are all familiar with.

The reason the normal curve looks the way it does — why it rises as it gets closer to the middle — is that the closer you get to that point, the smaller the change in the thing you’re measuring, and hence the more frequently it is likely to occur. A typical stock or portfolio of stocks, for example, is far likelier to gain or lose one point in a day (or a week) than it is to gain or lose 20 points. So the pattern of normal distribution will cluster around those smaller changes toward the middle of the curve, while the less-frequent distributions will fall along the ends of the curve.

VaR uses this normal distribution curve to plot the riskiness of a portfolio. But it makes certain assumptions. VaR is often measured daily and rarely extends beyond a few weeks, and because it is a very short-term measure, it assumes that tomorrow will be more or less like today. Even what’s called “historical VaR” — a variation of standard VaR that measures potential portfolio risk a year or two out, only uses the previous few years as its benchmark. As the risk consultant Marc Groz puts it, “The years 2005-2006,” which were the culmination of the housing bubble, “aren’t a very good universe for predicting what happened in 2007-2008.”

This was one of Alan Greenspan’s primary excuses when he made his mea culpa for the financial crisis before Congress a few months ago. After pointing out that a Nobel Prize had been awarded for work that led to some of the theories behind derivative pricing and risk management, he said: “The whole intellectual edifice, however, collapsed in the summer of last year because the data input into the risk-management models generally covered only the past two decades, a period of euphoria. Had instead the models been fitted more appropriately to historic periods of stress, capital requirements would have been much higher and the financial world would be in far better shape today, in my judgment.” Well, yes. That was also the point Taleb was making in his lecture when he referred to what he called future-blindness. People tend not to be able to anticipate a future they have never personally experienced.

Yet even faulty historical data isn’t Taleb’s primary concern. What he cares about, with standard VaR, is not the number that falls within the 99 percent probability. He cares about what happens in the other 1 percent, at the extreme edge of the curve. The fact that you are not likely to lose more than a certain amount 99 percent of the time tells you absolutely nothing about what could happen the other 1 percent of the time. You could lose $51 million instead of $50 million — no big deal. That happens two or three times a year, and no one blinks an eye. You could also lose billions and go out of business. VaR has no way of measuring which it will be.

What will cause you to lose billions instead of millions? Something rare, something you’ve never considered a possibility. Taleb calls these events “fat tails” or “black swans,” and he is convinced that they take place far more frequently than most human beings are willing to contemplate. Groz has his own way of illustrating the problem: he showed me a slide he made of a curve with the letters “T.B.D.” at the extreme ends of the curve. I thought the letters stood for “To Be Determined,” but that wasn’t what Groz meant. “T.B.D. stands for ‘There Be Dragons,’ ” he told me.

And that’s the point. Because we don’t know what a black swan might look like or when it might appear and therefore don’t plan for it, it will always get us in the end. “Any system susceptible to a black swan will eventually blow up,” Taleb says. The modern system of world finance, complex and interrelated and opaque, where what happened yesterday can and does affect what happens tomorrow, and where one wrong tug of the thread can cause it all to unravel, is just such a system.

“I have been calling for the abandonment of certain risk measures since 1996 because they cause people to cross the street blindfolded,” he said toward the end of his lecture. “The system went bust because nobody listened to me.”

After the lecture, the professor who invited Taleb to Columbia took a handful of people out for a late lunch at a nearby diner. Somewhat surprisingly, given Taleb’s well-known scorn for risk managers, the professor had also invited several risk managers who worked at two big investment banks. We had barely been seated before they tried to engage Taleb in a debate over the value of VaR. But Taleb is impossible to argue with on this subject; every time they raised an objection to his argument, he curtly dismissed them out of hand. “VaR can be useful,” said one of the risk managers. “It depends on how you use it. It can be useful in identifying trends.”

“This argument is addressed in ‘The Black Swan,’ ” Taleb retorted. “Not a single person has offered me an argument I haven’t heard.”

“I think VaR is great,” said another risk manager. “I think it is a fantastic tool. It’s like an altimeter in aircraft. It has some margin for error, but if you’re a pilot, you know how to deal with it. But very few pilots give up using it.”

Taleb replied: “Altimeters have errors that are Gaussian. You can compensate. In the real world, the magnitude of errors is much less known.”

Around and around they went, talking past each other for the next hour or so. It was engaging but unsatisfying; it didn’t help illuminate the role risk management played in the crisis.

The conversation had an energizing effect on Taleb, however. He walked out of the diner with a full head of steam, railing about the two “imbeciles” he just had to endure. I used the moment to ask if he knew the people at RiskMetrics, a successful risk-management consulting firm that spun out of the original JPMorgan quant effort in the mid-1990s. “They’re intellectual charlatans,” he replied dismissively. “You can quote me on that.”

As we approached his car, he began talking about his own performance in 2008. Although he is no longer a full-time trader, he remains a principal in a hedge fund he helped found, Black Swan Protection Protocol. His fund makes trades that either gain or lose small amounts of money in normal times but can make oversize gains when a black swan appears. Taleb likes to say that, as a trader, he has made money only three times in his life — in the crash of 1987, during the dot-com bust more than a decade later and now. But all three times he has made a killing. With the world crashing around it, his fund was up 65 to 115 percent for the year. Taleb chuckled. “They wouldn’t listen to me,” he said finally. “So I decided, to hell with them, I’ll take their money instead.”

“VaR WAS INEVITABLE,” Gregg Berman of RiskMetrics said when I went to see him a few days later. He didn’t sound like an intellectual charlatan. His explanation of the utility of VaR — and its limitations — made a certain undeniable sense. He did, however, sound like somebody who was completely taken aback by the amount of blame placed on risk modeling since the financial crisis began.

“Obviously, we are big proponents of risk models,” he said. “But a computer does not do risk modeling. People do it. And people got overzealous and they stopped being careful. They took on too much leverage. And whether they had models that missed that, or they weren’t paying enough attention, I don’t know. But I do think that this was much more a failure of management than of risk management. I think blaming models for this would be very unfortunate because you are placing blame on a mathematical equation. You can’t blame math,” he added with some exasperation.

Although Berman, who is 42, was a founding partner of RiskMetrics, it turned out that he was one of the few at the firm who hadn’t come from JPMorgan. Still, he knew the back story. How could he not? It was part of the lore of the place. Indeed, it was part of the lore of VaR.

The late 1980s and the early 1990s were a time when many firms were trying to devise more sophisticated risk models because the world was changing around them. Banks, whose primary risk had long been credit risk — the risk that a loan might not be paid back — were starting to meld with investment banks, which traded stocks and bonds. Derivatives and securitizations — those pools of mortgages or credit-card loans that were bundled by investment firms and sold to investors — were becoming an increasingly important component of Wall Street. But they were devilishly complicated to value. For one thing, many of the more arcane instruments didn’t trade very often, so you had to try to value them by finding a comparable security that did trade. And they were sliced into different pieces — tranches they’re called — each of which had a different risk component. In addition every desk had its own way of measuring risk that was largely incompatible with every other desk.

JPMorgan’s chairman at the time VaR took off was a man named Dennis Weatherstone. Weatherstone, who died in 2008 at the age of 77, was a working-class Englishman who acquired the bearing of a patrician during his long career at the bank. He was soft-spoken, polite, self-effacing. At the point at which he took over JPMorgan, it had moved from being purely a commercial bank into one of these new hybrids. Within the bank, Weatherstone had long been known as an expert on risk, especially when he was running the foreign-exchange trading desk. But as chairman, he quickly realized that he understood far less about the firm’s overall risk than he needed to. Did the risk in JPMorgan’s stock portfolio cancel out the risk being taken by its bond portfolio — or did it heighten those risks? How could you compare different kinds of derivative risks? What happened to the portfolio when volatility increased or interest rates rose? How did currency fluctuations affect the fixed-income instruments? Weatherstone had no idea what the answers were. He needed a way to compare the risks of those various assets and to understand what his companywide risk was.

The answer the bank’s quants had come up with was Value at Risk. To phrase it that way is to make it sound as if a handful of math whizzes locked themselves in a room one day, cranked out some formulas, and — presto! — they had a risk-management system. In fact, it took around seven years, according to Till Guldimann, an elegant, Swiss-born, former JPMorgan banker who ran the team that devised VaR and who is now vice chairman of SunGard Data Systems. “VaR is not just one invention,” he said. “You solved one problem and another cropped up. At first it seemed unmanageable. But as we refined it, the methodologies got better.”

Early on, the group decided that it wanted to come up with a number it could use to gauge the possibility that any kind of portfolio could lose a certain amount of money over the next 24 hours, within a 95 percent probability. (Many firms still use the 95 percent VaR, though others prefer 99 percent.) That became the core concept. When the portfolio changed, as traders bought and sold securities the next day, the VaR was then recalculated, allowing everyone to see whether the new trades had added to, or lessened, the firm’s risk.

“There was a lot of suspicion internally,” recalls Guldimann, because traders and executives — nonquants — didn’t believe that such a thing could be quantified mathematically. But they were wrong. Over time, as VaR was proved more correct than not day after day, quarter after quarter, the top executives came not only to believe in it but also to rely on it.

For instance, during his early years as a risk manager, pre-VaR, Guldimann often confronted the problem of what to do when a trader had reached his trading limit but believed he should be given more capital to play out his hand. “How would I know if he should get the increase?” Guldimann says. “All I could do is ask around. Is he a good guy? Does he know what he’s doing? It was ridiculous. Once we converted all the limits to VaR limits, we could compare. You could look at the profits the guy made and compare it to his VaR. If the guy who asked for a higher limit was making more money with lower VaR” — that is, with less risk — “it was a good basis to give him the money.”

By the early 1990s, VaR had become such a fixture at JPMorgan that Weatherstone instituted what became known as the 415 report because it was handed out every day at 4:15, just after the market closed. It allowed him to see what every desk’s estimated profit and loss was, as compared to its risk, and how it all added up for the entire firm. True, it didn’t take into account Taleb’s fat tails, but nobody really expected it to do that. Weatherstone had been a trader himself; he understood both the limits and the value of VaR. It told him things he hadn’t known before. He could use it to help him make judgments about whether the firm should take on additional risk or pull back. And that’s what he did.

What caused VaR to catapult above the risk systems being developed by JPMorgan competitors was what the firm did next: it gave VaR away. In 1993, Guldimann made risk the theme of the firm’s annual client conference. Many of the clients were so impressed with the JPMorgan approach that they asked if they could purchase the underlying system. JPMorgan decided it didn’t want to get into that business, but proceeded instead to form a small group, RiskMetrics, that would teach the concept to anyone who wanted to learn it, while also posting it on the Internet so that other risk experts could make suggestions to improve it. As Guldimann wrote years later, “Many wondered what the bank was trying to accomplish by giving away ‘proprietary’ methodologies and lots of data, but not selling any products or services.” He continued, “It popularized a methodology and made it a market standard, and it enhanced the image of JPMorgan.”

JPMorgan later spun RiskMetrics off into its own consulting company. By then, VaR had become so popular that it was considered the risk-model gold standard. Here was the odd thing, though: the month RiskMetrics went out on its own, September 1998, was also when Long-Term Capital Management “blew up.” L.T.C.M. was a fantastically successful hedge fund famous for its quantitative trading approach and its belief, supposedly borne out by its risk models, that it was taking minimal risk.

L.T.C.M.’s collapse would seem to make a pretty good case for Taleb’s theories. What brought the firm down was a black swan it never saw coming: the twin financial crises in Asia and Russia. Indeed, so sure were the firm’s partners that the market would revert to “normal” — which is what their model insisted would happen — that they continued to take on exposures that would destroy the firm as the crisis worsened, according to Roger Lowenstein’s account of the debacle, “When Genius Failed.” Oh, and another thing: among the risk models the firm relied on was VaR.

Aaron Brown, the former risk manager at Morgan Stanley, remembers thinking that the fall of L.T.C.M. could well lead to the demise of VaR. “It thoroughly punctured the myth that VaR was invincible,” he said. “Something that fails to live up to perfection is more despised than something that was never idealized in the first place.” After the 1987 market crash, for example, portfolio insurance, which had been sold by Wall Street as a risk-mitigation device, became largely discredited.

But that didn’t happen with VaR. There was so much schadenfreude associated with L.T.C.M. — it had Nobel Prize winners among its partners! — that it was easy for the rest of Wall Street to view its fall as an example of comeuppance. And for a hedge fund that promoted the ingeniousness of its risk measures, it took far greater risks than it ever acknowledged.

For these reasons, other firms took to rationalizing away the fall of L.T.C.M.; they viewed it as a human failure rather than a failure of risk modeling. The collapse only amplified the feeling on Wall Street that firms needed to be able to understand their risks for the entire firm. Only VaR could do that. And finally, there was a belief among some, especially after the crisis abated, that the events that brought down L.T.C.M. were one in a million. We would never see anything like that again in our lifetime.

So instead of diminishing in importance, VaR became a more important part of the financial scene. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, worried about the amount of risk that derivatives posed to the system, mandated that financial firms would have to disclose that risk to investors, and VaR became the de facto measure. If the VaR number increased from year to year in a company’s annual report, it meant the firm was taking more risk. Rather than doing anything to limit the growth of derivatives, the agency concluded that disclosure, via VaR, was sufficient.

That, in turn, meant that even firms that had resisted VaR now succumbed. It meant that chief executives of big banks and investment firms had to have at least a passing familiarity with VaR. It meant that traders all had to understand the VaR consequences of making a big bet or of changing their portfolios. Some firms continued to use VaR as a tool while adding other tools as well, like “stress” or “scenario” tests, to see where the weak links in the portfolio were or what might happen if the market dropped drastically. But others viewed VaR as the primary measure they had to concern themselves with.

VaR, in other words, became institutionalized. RiskMetrics went from having a dozen risk-management clients to more than 600. Lots of competitors sprouted up. Long-Term Capital Management became an increasingly distant memory, overshadowed by the Internet boom and then the housing boom. Corporate chieftains like Stanley O’Neal at Merrill Lynch and Charles Prince at Citigroup pushed their divisions to take more risk because they were being left behind in the race for trading profits. All over Wall Street, VaR numbers increased, but it still all seemed manageable — and besides, nothing bad was happening!

VaR also became a crutch. When an international banking group that advises national regulators decided the world needed more sophisticated ways to gauge the amount of capital that firms had to hold, Wall Street firms lobbied the group to allow them to use their internal VaR numbers. Ultimately, the group came up with an accord that allowed just that. It doesn’t seem too strong to say that as a direct result, banks didn’t have nearly enough capital when the black swan began to emerge in the spring of 2007.

ONE THING THAT surprised me, as I made the rounds of risk experts, was that if you listened closely, their views weren’t really that far from Taleb’s diagnosis of VaR. They agreed with him that VaR didn’t measure the risk of a black swan. And they were critical in other ways as well. Yes, the old way of measuring capital requirements needed updating, but it was crazy to base it on a firm’s internal VaR, partly because that VaR was not set by regulators and partly because it obviously didn’t gauge the kind of extreme events that destroy capital and create a liquidity crisis — precisely the moment when you need cash on hand.

Indeed, Ethan Berman, the chief executive of RiskMetrics (and no relation to Gregg Berman), told me that one of VaR’s flaws, which only became obvious in this crisis, is that it didn’t measure liquidity risk — and of course a liquidity crisis is exactly what we’re in the middle of right now. One reason nobody seems to know how to deal with this kind of crisis is because nobody envisioned it.

In a crisis, Brown, the risk manager at AQR, said, “you want to know who can kill you and whether or not they will and who you can kill if necessary. You need to have an emergency backup plan that assumes everyone is out to get you. In peacetime, you think about other people’s intentions. In wartime, only their capabilities matter. VaR is a peacetime statistic.”

VaR DIDN’T GET EVERYTHING right even in what it purported to measure. All the triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities churned out by Wall Street firms and that turned out to be little more than junk? VaR didn’t see the risk because it generally relied on a two-year data history. Although it took into account the increased risk brought on by leverage, it failed to distinguish between leverage that came from long-term, fixed-rate debt — bonds and such that come due at a set date — and loans that can be called in at any time and can, as Brown put it “blow you up in two minutes.” That is, the kind of leverage that disappeared the minute something bad arose.

“The old adage, ‘garbage in, garbage out’ certainly applies,” Groz said. “When you realize that VaR is using tame historical data to model a wildly different environment, the total losses of Bear Stearns’ hedge funds become easier to understand. It’s like the historic data only has rainstorms and then a tornado hits.”

Guldimann, the great VaR proselytizer, sounded almost mournful when he talked about what he saw as another of VaR’s shortcomings. To him, the big problem was that it turned out that VaR could be gamed. That is what happened when banks began reporting their VaRs. To motivate managers, the banks began to compensate them not just for making big profits but also for making profits with low risks. That sounds good in principle, but managers began to manipulate the VaR by loading up on what Guldimann calls “asymmetric risk positions.” These are products or contracts that, in general, generate small gains and very rarely have losses. But when they do have losses, they are huge. These positions made a manager’s VaR look good because VaR ignored the slim likelihood of giant losses, which could only come about in the event of a true catastrophe. A good example was a credit-default swap, which is essentially insurance that a company won’t default. The gains made from selling credit-default swaps are small and steady — and the chance of ever having to pay off that insurance was assumed to be minuscule. It was outside the 99 percent probability, so it didn’t show up in the VaR number. People didn’t see the size of those hidden positions lurking in that 1 percent that VaR didn’t measure.

EVEN MORE CRITICAL, it did not properly account for leverage that was employed through the use of options. For example, said Groz, if an asset manager borrows money to buy shares of a company, the VaR would usually increase. But say he instead enters into a contract that gives someone the right to sell him those shares at a lower price at a later time — a put option. In that case, the VaR might remain unchanged. From the outside, he would look as if he were taking no risk, but in fact, he is. If the share price of the company falls steeply, he will have lost a great deal of money. Groz called this practice “stuffing risk into the tails.”

And yet, instead of dismissing VaR as worthless, most of the experts I talked to defended it. The issue, it seemed to me, was less what VaR did and did not do, but how you thought about it. Taleb says that because VaR didn’t measure the 1 percent, it was worse than useless — it was downright harmful. But most of the risk experts said there was a great deal to be said for being able to manage risk 99 percent of the time, however imperfectly, even though it meant you couldn’t account for the last 1 percent.

“If you say that all risk is unknowable,” Gregg Berman said, “you don’t have the basis of any sort of a bet or a trade. You cannot buy and sell anything unless you have some idea of the expectation of how it will move.” In other words, if you spend all your time thinking about black swans, you’ll be so risk averse you’ll never do a trade. Brown put it this way: “NT” — that is how he refers to Nassim Nicholas Taleb — “says that 1 percent will dominate your outcomes. I think the other 99 percent does matter. There are things you can do to control your risk. To not use VaR is to say that I won’t care about the 99 percent, in which case you won’t have a business. That is true even though you know the fate of the firm is going to be determined by some huge event. When you think about disasters, all you can rely on is the disasters of the past. And yet you know that it will be different in the future. How do you plan for that?”

One risk-model critic, Richard Bookstaber, a hedge-fund risk manager and author of “A Demon of Our Own Design,” ranted about VaR for a half-hour over dinner one night. Then he finally said, “If you put a gun to my head and asked me what my firm’s risk was, I would use VaR.” VaR may have been a flawed number, but it was the best number anyone had come up with.

Of course, the experts I was speaking to were, well, experts. They had a deep understanding of risk modeling and all its inherent limitations. They thought about it all the time. Brown even thought VaR was good when the numbers seemed “off,” or when it started to “miss” on a regular basis — it either meant that there was something wrong with the way VaR was being calculated, or it meant the market was no longer acting “normally.” Either way, he said, it told you something useful.

“When I teach it,” Christopher Donohue, the managing director of the research group at the Global Association of Risk Professionals, said, “I immediately go into the shortcomings. You can’t calculate a VaR number and think you know everything you need. On a day-to-day basis I don’t care so much that the VaR is 42. I care about where it was yesterday and where it is going tomorrow. What direction is the risk going?” Then he added, “That is probably another danger: because we put a dollar number to it, they attach a meaning to it.”

By “they,” Donohue meant everyone who wasn’t a risk manager or a risk expert. There were the investors who saw the VaR numbers in the annual reports but didn’t pay them the least bit of attention. There were the regulators who slept soundly in the knowledge that, thanks to VaR, they had the whole risk thing under control. There were the boards who heard a VaR number once or twice a year and thought it sounded good. There were chief executives like O’Neal and Prince. There was everyone, really, who, over time, forgot that the VaR number was only meant to describe what happened 99 percent of the time. That $50 million wasn’t just the most you could lose 99 percent of the time. It was the least you could lose 1 percent of the time. In the bubble, with easy profits being made and risk having been transformed into mathematical conceit, the real meaning of risk had been forgotten. Instead of scrutinizing VaR for signs of impending trouble, they took comfort in a number and doubled down, putting more money at risk in the expectation of bigger gains. “It has to do with the human condition,” said one former risk manager. “People like to have one number they can believe in.”

Brown told me: “You absolutely could see it coming. You could see the risks rising. However, in the two years before the crisis hit, instead of preparing for it, the opposite took place to an extreme degree. The real trouble we got into today is because of things that took place in the two years before, when the risk measures were saying that things were getting bad.”

At most firms, risk managers are not viewed as “profit centers,” so they lack the clout of the moneymakers on the trading desks. That was especially true at the tail end of the bubble, when firms were grabbing for every last penny of profit.

At the height of the bubble, there was so much money to be made that any firm that pulled back because it was nervous about risk would forsake huge short-term gains and lose out to less cautious rivals. The fact that VaR didn’t measure the possibility of an extreme event was a blessing to the executives. It made black swans all the easier to ignore. All the incentives — profits, compensation, glory, even job security — went in the direction of taking on more and more risk, even if you half suspected it would end badly. After all, it would end badly for everyone else too. As the former Citigroup chief executive Charles Prince famously put it, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” Or, as John Maynard Keynes once wrote, a “sound banker” is one who, “when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way.”

MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE been different if the people in charge had a better understanding of risk. Maybe it would have helped if Wall Street hadn’t turned VaR into something it was never meant to be. “If we stick with the Dennis Weatherstone example,” Ethan Berman says, “he recognized that he didn’t have the transparency into risk that he needed to make a judgment. VaR gave him that, and he and his managers could make judgments. To me, that is how it should work. The role of VaR is as one input into that process. It is healthy for the head of the firm to have that kind of information. But people need to have incentives to give him that information.”

Which brings me back to David Viniar and Goldman Sachs. “VaR is a useful tool,” he said as our interview was nearing its end. “The more liquid the asset, the better the tool. The more history, the better the tool. The less of both, the worse it is. It helps you understand what you should expect to happen on a daily basis in an environment that is roughly the same. We had a trade last week in the mortgage universe where the VaR was $1 million. The same trade a week later had a VaR of $6 million. If you tell me my risk hasn’t changed — I say yes it has!” Two years ago, VaR worked for Goldman Sachs the way it once worked for Dennis Weatherstone — it gave the firm a signal that allowed it to make a judgment about risk. It wasn’t the only signal, but it helped. It wasn’t just the math that helped Goldman sidestep the early decline of mortgage-backed instruments. But it wasn’t just judgment either. It was both. The problem on Wall Street at the end of the housing bubble is that all judgment was cast aside. The math alone was never going to be enough.

Like most firms, Goldman does have other models to test for the fat tails. But even Goldman has been caught flat-footed by the crisis, struggling with liquidity, turning itself into a bank holding company and even, at one dire moment, struggling to combat rumors that it would be the next to fall.

“The question is: how extreme is extreme?” Viniar said. “Things that we would have thought were so extreme have happened. We used to say, What will happen if every equity market in the world goes down by 30 percent at the same time? We used to think of that as an extreme event — except that now it has happened. Nothing ever happens until it happens for the first time.”

Which didn’t mean you couldn’t use risk models to sniff out risks. You just had to know that there were risks they didn’t sniff out — and be ever vigilant for the dragons. When Wall Street stopped looking for dragons, nothing was going to save it. Not even VaR.
69 2009-01-04 Something’s going right when 11-year-old boys are so enthused about the chemistry experiment they’ve just completed that they draw a poster-size illustration with characters representing the variables — in this case, yeast, sugar and water — to take home to their parents. This particular experiment, part of an after-school curriculum, goes way beyond test tubes: after watching the mixture bubble and froth, the boys add flour, make it into pizza dough, bake it and eat the results.

The curriculum, Kitchen Science Investigators, was designed by Christina Gardner and Tamara Clegg, both 28, who are researching cognition and learning environments as they work toward computer-science doctorates at Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing.

“Tammy likes to cook and I love science, so we made software that put those together,” Ms. Gardner says. “We wanted kids to understand that science is applicable to their everyday lives, and we approached that through cooking. As a bonus, they get life skills, because a lot of their parents don’t cook anything from scratch.”

Ms. Gardner and Ms. Clegg tested the curriculum over eight months last school year at two Atlanta-area middle schools ­— one public, one private — and at summer camp. All told, they’ve taught more than 200 tweens.

In each session, students prepared dishes while simultaneously conducting experiments to discover the chemical reactions behind what’s in the oven. Yeast is used to blow up a balloon — and add spring to a pizza pie crust. Eggs are shown to emulsify oil and water — and when in the correct quantity, lend a brownie its chewy quality.

“They were really into it because it was cooking,” says Ravonda Hardy, a sixth-grade teacher at one of the middle schools, Chapel Hill in Decatur, Ga., who helped organize weekly sessions for more than a dozen girls interested in science and math. “It took a while for them to realize they were actually conducting experiments.”
70 2009-01-04 Joe Hynek may be the only student at Iowa State University who carries a handbag for “scientific purposes.” On cloudless days, he wanders his neighborhood to test whether the purse, which is plated in thin solar panels and contains a lightweight battery, is absorbing energy from the sun. After three hours of direct exposure, the purse generates enough electricity to charge an iPod, camera or cellphone. (The bag will also charge — more slowly — if placed next to a window.) Mr. Hynek is currently working on the final touch: a small display screen that will indicate when the purse is best angled for absorbing the day’s light.

A doctoral student in Iowa State’s department of mechanical engineering, Mr. Hynek designed the Power Purse as his final project in an experimental garment design class. He was the only male student. The course required that each student design five dresses, but Mr. Hynek negotiated with the professor to focus on handbags instead. He spent the term searching fashion magazines for a purse design that would appeal to women “interested in projecting power.”

The final product is black and boxlike, with a clear plastic handle. He hopes the purse will be for sale in the next year, priced at roughly $350. Depending on how sales go, Mr. Hynek will expand the line, to solar-powered bracelets and ties.
71 2009-01-04 The case cleaved the community in much the same way, especially after it turned out that several of the school board members, who were basically clueless about both evolution and intelligent design, had lied when they claimed religious considerations were not behind their wish to introduce intelligent design. The judge, ruling for the plaintiffs, accused the Dover Board of Education of “breathtaking inanity,” which brought down such a hail of denunciation from anti-evolutionists that for a while federal marshals had to guard his house and family. And when the town of Dover, weary of the whole mess, eventually voted out the old school board, the televangelist Pat Robertson delivered his own verdict: if a disaster were by any chance to hit the town, the citizens shouldn’t look to God for help.

The lead witness for the plaintiffs in the Dover case was Mr. Miller, a biology professor at Brown University and the author of “Only a Theory,” and from his book you can easily see why he was so effective. He is clear and incisive and knows how to make things like the bacterial flagellum comprehensible to the layman. The flagellum, a little rotor-like mechanism that propels bacteria in the digestive system, so closely resembles what we would call an engine of human design that proponents of intelligent design have concluded it must be the work of a master designer.

In a few concise chapters Mr. Miller pretty much dismantles all the claims, such as they are, for the intelligent design movement. The flagellum, he says, far from being a custom design, so to speak, made from parts expressly created for that purpose, is, like so much else in nature, a jury-rigged device made from bits cobbled together from the cellular spare-parts bin.

Mr. Miller also adds an impassioned argument for why the rest of us shouldn’t just turn our heads and let a few benighted school systems teach whatever they want. Good students will eventually see the light, one argument goes, and as for the others — well, they probably weren’t going to be biologists anyway. But Mr. Miller believes that our very scientific soul is at stake and that the argument for intelligent design is just the first step in an attempt to redefine science itself and make it consonant not with scientific truth but with whatever you want to believe.

The reason the anti-Darwinians are willing to go so far is that they see themselves in a life-and-death struggle to keep society from being secularized and traditional values from being undermined. In fact, evolutionary theory contains no moral component whatsoever, but the gap between religious fundamentalists and those who want to preserve the principle of free scientific inquiry may be unbridgeable. Ms. Lebo concludes sadly, “We’re never going to fix this.”

In “Monkey Trials and Gorilla Sermons: Evolution and Christianity From Darwin to Intelligent Design,” first published last year and due out in paperback in April, Peter J. Bowler points out that extreme biblical literalism — of the sort that insists that creation took place as Genesis depicts it — may be more widespread now even than in 1859, when “The Origin of Species” was published.

There was a great 19th-century tradition of clergymen scientists who studied the natural word and especially the fossil record for evidence of the divine plan, and many of them embraced Darwin’s discoveries or at least the possibility that the biblical account might be metaphorical. Only in the 1950s, Mr. Bowler says, did strict biblical literalism become the foundation for mainstream creationism. His book also documents a long history of liberal compromise in which theologians tried to reconcile evolution with Christian belief.

To a large degree, though, these compromises depended on a misunderstanding of Darwinism, clinging to a notion of progress and purposefulness that is not really supported by evolutionary theory. Darwinism, strictly interpreted, describes a world that is random, haphazard and mostly unpredictable. Other compromisers have posited a creator who doesn’t bear much resemblance to the benevolent, all-powerful God of the biblical accounts and doesn’t guarantee much in the way of meaning to life.

There is a middle way, theologians and even some scientists like Mr. Miller keep insisting, but it’s not easily arrived at. The trouble with many of the new philosophies, like Mr. Miller’s idea of “evolutionary cosmology,” which sees our existence in the world as an inherent part of nature itself, is that they lack the clarity, simplicity and emotional satisfaction of traditional religion; and even what Stephen Jay Gould used to call the “cold bath” of Darwinism, when we finally get over thinking of ourselves as the pinnacle of life’s purpose, is in its own wayjust as powerful and arresting. Mr. Bowler thinks that if we understand the history of the debate better we might be able to depolarize it, but that may be too much to hope. Most of us are in the blissful position of having already made up our minds without bothering to think about it.

92 2009-01-05 The owner of a cloned dog is quoted as saying, “Cloning means you could have the opportunity to have the same dog with you for your entire life.” That is a misperception.

Despite the fact that this person and his wife spent $155,000 to clone their late yellow Labrador, not even for this price will they ever spend the rest of their lives together with their late dog for the simple reason that genes do not control everything in life.

A big part of who their dog was can be attributed to the environment (which exerts abundant changes on the genetic material).

Unfortunately, many people in favor of reproductive cloning tend to ignore this in the false hope of “resurrecting” their beloved pets or even relatives.

Just because someone has the same DNA as you do does not make him or her an identical clone. Just ask identical twins!
93 2009-01-05 BALTIMORE — A bull named Hammered had just ejected a professional rider named Luke Snyder, who landed boots-over-buckle on his head and moseyed dizzily to the locker room.

“I took a big old swan dive right over his left horn,” Snyder explained after he plopped down and asked no one in particular for some aspirin.

He lasted about four seconds atop Hammered on Friday night during the Professional Bull Riders tour stop at the downtown 1st Mariner Arena. To earn points at all — and, thus, any money — a rider needs to hold on for eight seconds.

But there would be another show Saturday night.

No sport packs as much into eight seconds as bull riding. In Baltimore, the winner, Kasey Hayes, rode for 24 seconds and earned $28,370. That is a pay rate of more than $4.25 million an hour — as if anyone could ride the 1,500-pound likes of Chief of Staff, Walk the Line or El Presidente for an hour, or would want to. Snyder rode a total of 11.3 seconds, earned nothing, and was left to hope — and wait — for better results at Madison Square Garden this weekend. But waiting is what bull riders do most. After his first ride in Baltimore, Snyder had almost exactly 24 hours to think about his second one. First, he had to get rid of the headache.

Snyder is a 26-year-old from Raymore, Mo., with a black hat, a dignified air and a nose reconstructed a few years ago by a surgeon who used Snyder’s driver’s license as a guide. That procedure followed a head-to-head run-in with a bull — a brutally common collision known among riders as being jerked down or, more graphically, dashboarded.

He was the tour’s 2001 rookie of the year, earning $348,560.54 the season he turned 19. He is now known in bull-riding circles for an ironman streak of 236 consecutive P.B.R. events. Part of each event is killing time between rounds.

After shaking his headache and changing into dirt-free Wranglers on Friday night, Snyder joined the 44 other P.B.R. tour members in signing autographs. Minutes later, Snyder was in a taxi, headed to the tour’s official after-party at Mex, a nightclub where female bartenders occasionally dance atop the bar.

Snyder, the first with a cowboy hat to arrive, bought a Bud Light. He earned $117,846.70 last year and ranked 23rd in the points standings. The tour pays for expenses like flights and hotels.

Other riders arrived, mostly oblivious to the halo of interest they received, particularly from women. Rodeo groupies are called buckle bunnies for the saucer-size silver buckles that cowboys earn for winning rodeo events. Snyder wore a buckle from last year’s victory in Nampa, Idaho.

A flirty woman in a straw hat slid through the crowd straight to Snyder. He stands out, even among cowboys. Everything about him seems extra starched, from the creased jeans to the crisp long-sleeve shirt to the brown-and-yellow turkey feather adorning his hat. He is dark and handsome and not so rugged, save for the scars on his chin. He looks approachable.

“Are you a rider?” she asked him.

“That guy is,” Snyder said, pointing across to a friend. She spun and redirected her pursuit. Snyder laughed behind her. He has had a girlfriend, Jayme, for about five years.

The drink of choice among other riders is a Jägerbomb, a mix of Jägermeister and Red Bull. Platters of the drinks were purchased as Bud Lights and Jack Daniel’s-and-Cokes, provided free, sat idle. Snyder found a spot against a back wall where he could watch and comment on the unfolding debauchery.

Within an hour, several riders were paired with 20-something women they just met. One rider was on an ottoman, pushed onto his back by a comely blonde. She rode like a bull rider and lifted her shirt, eliminating the need for an imagination. A friend pulled her away.

“What are you doing?” she shouted at her.

“I’ve never seen stuff like this, I swear to you,” he said.

About 1:30 a.m., Snyder ignored a loose plan to reconvene at the hotel. He fell asleep in his room watching “Righteous Kill,” with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.
94 2009-01-05 Friedman’s claim that monetary policy could have prevented was an attempt to refute the analysis of , who argued that monetary policy is ineffective under depression conditions and that fiscal policy — large-scale deficit spending by the government — is needed to fight mass unemployment. The failure of monetary policy in the current crisis shows that Keynes had it right the first time. And Keynesian thinking lies behind Mr. Obama’s plans to rescue the economy.

But these plans may turn out to be a hard sell.

News reports say that Democrats hope to pass an economic plan with broad bipartisan support. Good luck with that.

In reality, the political posturing has already started, with Republican leaders setting up roadblocks to stimulus legislation while posing as the champions of careful Congressional deliberation — which is pretty rich considering their party’s behavior over the past eight years.

More broadly, after decades of declaring that government is the problem, not the solution, not to mention reviling both Keynesian economics and the New Deal, most Republicans aren’t going to accept the need for a big-spending, F.D.R.-type solution to the economic crisis.

The biggest problem facing the Obama plan, however, is likely to be the demand of many politicians for proof that the benefits of the proposed public spending justify its costs — a burden of proof never imposed on proposals for tax cuts.

This is a problem with which Keynes was familiar: giving money away, he pointed out, tends to be met with fewer objections than plans for public investment “which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict ‘business’ principles.” What gets lost in such discussions is the key argument for economic stimulus — namely, that under current conditions, a surge in public spending would employ Americans who would otherwise be unemployed and money that would otherwise be sitting idle, and put both to work producing something useful.

All of this leaves me concerned about the prospects for the Obama plan. I’m sure that Congress will pass a , but I worry that the plan may be delayed and/or downsized. And Mr. Obama is right: We really do need swift, bold action.

Here’s my nightmare scenario: It takes Congress months to pass a stimulus plan, and the legislation that actually emerges is too cautious. As a result, the economy plunges for most of 2009, and when the plan finally starts to kick in, it’s only enough to slow the descent, not stop it. Meanwhile, is setting in, while businesses and consumers start to base their spending plans on the expectation of a permanently depressed economy — well, you can see where this is going.

So this is our moment of truth. Will we in fact do what’s necessary to prevent Great Depression II?
95 2009-01-05 A settlement in October with authors and publishers who had brought two copyright lawsuits against Google will make it possible for users to read a far greater collection of books, including many still under copyright protection.

The agreement, pending approval by a judge this year, also paved the way for both sides to make profits from digital versions of books. Just what kind of commercial opportunity the settlement represents is unknown, but few expect it to generate significant profits for any individual author. Even Google does not necessarily expect the book program to contribute significantly to its bottom line.

“We did not think necessarily we could make money,” said Sergey Brin, a Google founder and its president of technology, in a brief interview at the company’s headquarters. “We just feel this is part of our core mission. There is fantastic information in books. Often when I do a search, what is in a book is miles ahead of what I find on a Web site.”

Revenue will be generated through advertising sales on pages where previews of scanned books appear, through subscriptions by libraries and others to a database of all the scanned books in Google’s collection, and through sales to consumers of digital access to copyrighted books. Google will take 37 percent of this revenue, leaving 63 percent for publishers and authors.

The settlement may give new life to copyrighted out-of-print books in a digital form and allow writers to make money from titles that had been out of commercial circulation for years. Of the seven million books Google has scanned so far, about five million are in this category.

Even if Google had gone to trial and won the suits, said Alexander Macgillivray, associate general counsel for products and intellectual property at the company, it would have won the right to show only previews of these books’ contents. “What people want to do is read the book,” Mr. Macgillivray said.

Users are already taking advantage of out-of-print books that have been scanned and are available for free download. Mr. Clancy was monitoring search queries recently when one for “concrete fountain molds” caught his attention. The search turned up a digital version of an obscure 1910 book, and the user had spent four hours perusing 350 pages of it.

For scholars and others researching topics not satisfied by a Wikipedia entry, the settlement will provide access to millions of books at the click of a mouse. “More students in small towns around America are going to have a lot more stuff at their fingertips,” said Michael A. Keller, the university librarian at Stanford. “That is really important.”

When the agreement was announced in October, all sides hailed it as a landmark settlement that permitted Google to proceed with its scanning project while protecting the rights and financial interests of authors and publishers. Both sides agreed to disagree on whether the book scanning itself violated authors’ and publishers’ copyrights.

In the months since, all parties to the lawsuits — as well as those, like librarians, who will be affected by it — have had the opportunity to examine the 303-page settlement document and try to digest its likely effects.

Some librarians privately expressed fears that Google might charge high prices for subscriptions to the book database as it grows. Although nonprofit groups like the Open Content Alliance are building their own digital collections, no other significant private-sector competitors are in the business. In May, Microsoft ended its book scanning project, effectively leaving Google as a monopoly corporate player.

David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, said the company wanted to push the book database to as many libraries as possible. “If the price gets too high,” he said, “we are simply not going to have libraries that can afford to purchase it.”

For readers who might want to buy digital access to an individual scanned book, Mr. Clancy said, Google was likely to sell at least half of the books for $5.99 or less. Students and faculty at universities who subscribe to the database will be able to get the full contents of all the books free.

For the average author, “this is not a game changer” in an economic sense, said Richard Sarnoff, chairman of the Association of American Publishers and president of the digital media investments group at Bertelsmann, the parent company of Random House, the world’s largest publisher of consumer books.

“They will get paid for the use of their book, but whether they will get paid so much that they can start living large — I think that’s just a fantasy,” Mr. Sarnoff said. “I think there will be a few authors who do see significant dollars out of this, but there will be a vast number of authors who see insignificant dollars out of this.”

But, he added, “a few hundred dollars for an individual author can equate to a considerable sum for a publisher with rights to 10,000 books.”

So far, publishers that have permitted Google to offer searchable digital versions of their new in-print books have seen a small payoff. Macmillan, the company that owns publishing houses including Farrar, Straus & Giroux and St. Martin’s Press and represents authors including Jonathan Franzen and Janet Evanovich, offers 11,000 titles for search on Google. In 2007, Macmillan estimated that Google helped sell about 16,400 copies.

Authors view the possibility of readers finding their out-of-print books as a cultural victory more than a financial one.

“Our culture is not just Stephen King’s latest novel or the new Harry Potter book,” said James Gleick, a member of the board of the Authors Guild. “It is also 1,000 completely obscure books that appeal not to the one million people who bought the Harry Potter book but to 100 people at a time.”

Some scholars worry that Google users are more likely to search for narrow information than to read at length. “I have to say that I think pedagogically and in terms of the advancement of scholarship, I have a concern that people will be encouraged to use books in this very fragmentary way,” said Alice Prochaska, university librarian at Yale.

Others said they thought readers would continue to appreciate long texts and that Google’s book search would simply help readers find them.

“There is no short way to appreciate Jane Austen, and I hope I’m right about that,” said Paul Courant, university librarian at the University of Michigan. “But a lot of reading is going to happen on screens. One of the important things about this settlement is that it brings the literature of the 20th century back into a form that the students of the 21st century will be able to find it.”

Google’s book search has already entered the popular culture, in the film version of “Twilight,” based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer about a teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire. Bella, one of the main characters, uses Google to find information about a local American Indian tribe. When the search leads her to a book, what does she do?

She goes to a bookstore and buys it.
96 2009-01-05 Interviews with several community leaders and individual women in Washington Heights echoed the findings, and revealed even more unconventional methods like “juice de jeans,” a noxious brew made by boiling denim hems.

“Some women prefer to have a more private experience with their abortion, which is certainly understandable,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, an obstetrician with Ibis Reproductive Health in San Francisco, which joined Gynuity Health Projects in New York in conducting the larger study. “The things they mention are, ‘It is easier.’ It was recommended to them by a friend or a family member.”

Dr. Carolyn Westhoff, an obstetrician at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, said the trend fits into a larger context of Dominicans seeking home remedies rather than the care of doctors or hospitals, partly because of a lack of insurance but mostly because of a lack of trust in the health care system. “This is not just a culture of self-inducted abortion,” she said. “This is a culture of going to the pharmacy and getting the medicine you need.”

Physicians say that women can obtain the pills either through pharmacies that are willing to bend the rules and provide the medicine without a prescription or by having the drugs shipped from overseas.

It is impossible to know how many women in New York or nationwide try to end their pregnancies themselves, but in the vibrant, socially conservative Dominican neighborhoods of Upper Manhattan, the various methods are passed like ancient cultural secrets. In a study of 610 women at three New York clinics in largely Dominican neighborhoods conducted eight years ago, 5 percent said they had taken misoprostol themselves, and 37 percent said they knew it was an abortion-inducing drug. Doctors and community leaders say they have not seen any signs of the phenomenon disappearing, which they find worrisome because of concerns about the drug’s effectiveness and potential side effects.

Sold under the brand name Cytotec, misoprostol is approved to induce abortion when taken with mifepristone, or RU-486; doctors also sometimes use it to induce labor, though it is not approved for that use. A spokesman for Pfizer, which manufacturers Cytotec, declined to comment beyond saying that the company does not support the off-label use of its products and noting that the label includes “F.D.A.’s strongest warning against use in women who are pregnant.”

That warning, in capital letters, also notes that the drug “can cause abortion.”

But it does not always do so, not least because notions of how best to use it vary from inserting several pills into the vagina to letting them dissolve under the tongue. The side effects can be serious, and include rupture of the uterus, severe bleeding and shock.

“We do worry because we don’t know where women are getting the instructions from,” said Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, which was also a partner on the Ibis study. “We imagine that there is misinformation on how to take it, which is why it could be hit or miss.”

In 2007 in Massachusetts, an 18-year-old Dominican immigrant named Amber Abreu took misoprostol in her 25th week of pregnancy and gave birth to a 1-pound baby girl who died four days later; a judge sentenced her in June to probation and ordered her into therapy. In South Carolina in February, a Mexican migrant farm worker, Gabriela Flores, pleaded guilty to illegally performing an abortion and was sentenced to 90 days in jail for taking misoprostol while four months pregnant in 2004. A Virginia man, Daniel Riase, is serving a five-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2007 to slipping the pills into his pregnant girlfriend’s glass of milk.

Researchers studying the phenomenon cite several factors that lead Dominican and other immigrant women to experiment with abortifacients: mistrust of the health-care system, fear of surgery, worry about deportation, concern about clinic protesters, cost and shame.

“It turns an abortion into a natural process and makes it look like a miscarriage,” said Dr. Mark Rosing, an obstetrician at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx who led the 2000 study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Women’s Association. “For people who don’t have access to abortion for social reasons, financial reasons or immigration reasons, it doesn’t seem like this horrible thing.”

Ms. Dominguez, for her part, said she had no insurance or money to pay for an abortion, and could not fathom getting one for fear her mother would find out. One of her friends had spent $1,200 on an abortion that left her with a uterine infection, and another friend endured the procedure without anesthesia, she said. In addition, Washington Heights is a tightknit community where abortion — as well as birth control — is shunned; if Ms. Dominguez were spotted entering a clinic, rumors could fly.

“There are scary moments, and you got to have a friend right next to you,” said Ms. Dominguez, now 30 and a mother of four. “It’s cheap but dangerous. Certain people are more delicate than others. But afterwards, I felt relief.”

A friend of Ms. Dominguez’s said her stepsister took the pills last year because she was in the country illegally, and worried that a doctor might turn her in. “She was just scared,” the woman said, speaking on the condition that her name not be published to protect the stepsister’s privacy. “She had no papers, no insurance, no nothing.”

The woman went to a free clinic afterward to make sure the pills had worked (they had). Health care workers and other community leaders say such visits are how they discovered widespread illicit use of the drug as well as homemade potions.

Dr. Rosing said he learned about Cytotec during his residency at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Washington Heights, where he saw a lot of Dominican immigrants with incomplete abortions in the emergency room. They spoke of taking the “star pill,” a nickname for the hexagonal shape of one form of misoprostol. He suspected “that has to be the tip of the iceberg,” he said, “and it was.”

The pills allow pregnant women a degree of denial over what is taking place. Like Ms. Dominguez, many women in the neighborhood talk about the need to bring on — or “down” — their periods, not abortion. Afterward, they might tell doctors or relatives they had lost the baby.

The Planned Parenthood study concluded that women in both nations “seemed to see inducing the termination of pregnancy, or abortions, as a part of the reality of their lives,” in a community where, as one interview subject put it, “we are all doctors.” The report noted that in a culture steeped in machismo, birth control is generally seen as the woman’s responsibility.

“If I introduce the condom into a relationship, I’m basically saying I’ve had somebody else, and I’ve not been faithful to you,” said Haydee Morales, a vice president at Planned Parenthood of New York.

Debralee Santos, program director at Casa Duarte, a community arts organization in Washington Heights, said that while she had never had reason to distrust medical professionals, she understood the apprehensions that kept other women from seeking them out. “I get it, I really do,” she said.

“It’s a community that, even as it comes of age, always relies on itself first,” explained Ms. Santos, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents. “Women, in particular, continue to help each other in ways that speak to tradition and solidarity.”

Ms. Dominguez, who volunteers at Casa Duarte and is known as Flaca, Spanish for skinny, did not want her name or photograph published at first. But after some thought, she decided to allow it so more people would learn about the trap many pregnant Dominican women feel they are in.

“It’s a health risk,” she said. “There’s a lot of girls in situations like that, and they’re overwhelmed.”
97 2009-01-05 “Europe has to play a bigger role in the Middle East, and we believe we can,” said Eric Chevallier, a special adviser to Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister. “We are eager to work with the United States, especially the new administration, but we cannot wait.”

In a statement markedly more critical of the Israeli ground offensive than comments from Washington, the European Union said that even Israel’s indisputable right to defend itself did not “allow actions which largely affect civilians.”

France described the Israeli action as a “dangerous military escalation,” while also condemning the continuing rocket bombardment of Israeli targets from Gaza. A senior British diplomat said London was “bewildered” by Israel’s strategy.

The European Commission promised about $4.2 million to provide food, emergency shelter and medical supplies to residents of Gaza, and appealed to Israel to ease access to Gaza for humanitarian relief.

Despite the large sums of money spent in aid to the Palestinian Authority, the European Union has had little to show for years of efforts to help bring peace to the Middle East, where the United States is seen as the most important international power broker.

European efforts to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians have also been impeded by divisions among the union’s 27 member nations. Some are more openly critical of Israel, and others — including Britain, Germany and some Eastern European nations — align themselves more closely with Washington.

In London, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Sunday that any solution to the conflict would have to include stopping the flow of arms into the region and ensuring international monitoring. Mr. Brown told the BBC that Arab powers had to apply pressure to ensure that illegal tunnels used to smuggle arms into Gaza were sealed.

Cristina Gallach, a spokeswoman for Javier Solana, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said the European initiative was part of a policy of engagement dating from 2000. “If you have a European delegation,” Ms. Gallach said, “and you don’t have a U.S. delegation, then the E.U. will be more visible.”

Across Europe, criticism of Israel has been vocal. In London, at least 10,000 people marched Saturday to Trafalgar Square. Outside the prime minister’s residence, protesters threw shoes at the gates, echoing the Iraqi journalist who confronted President Bush several weeks ago. Protests also took place in France, Italy, Germany and Turkey.
98 2009-01-05 Classical music has always produced superstar performers who thrill the public and claim widespread attention. But there have also always been dedicated artists with lower profiles who influence the field from within and enjoy productive and important careers. The pianist Nadia Reisenberg is a good example.

When Reisenberg died at 78 in 1983, she was best known as a respected teacher at the Juilliard School, the Mannes College of Music (now Mannes College the New School for Music) and other institutions, who nurtured students like the pianist Richard Goode and the conductors Myung-Whun Chung and Andrew Litton. But in her prime Reisenberg had a busy concert career as well, winning acclaim for her musically sensitive and technically effortless artistry.

For a while she was a familiar name to music lovers in America, especially during the 1939-40 concert season, when she played the 27 Mozart piano concertos in a series of weekly radio broadcasts with the WOR Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alfred Wallenstein, an impressive feat. During that period she was a regular soloist with the New York Philharmonic, though conductors generally turned to her for contemporary fare ignored by big-name pianists on the touring circuit: works like Vincent d’Indy’s “Symphony on a French Mountain Air,” a charming piece that remains a rarity; the concertos of Kabalevsky and Rimsky-Korsakov; and Prokofiev’s daunting Third Piano Concerto, a piece seldom heard in the 1940s but a staple today.

Thanks to a remarkable new four-CD set from the Bridge label, “Nadia Reisenberg: A Chopin Treasury,” Reisenberg may come to the attention of a generation of listeners who have heard little if anything about her. This reissue of recordings made by Westminster Records in the mid-1950s includes Chopin’s complete nocturnes and mazurkas, the Barcarolle, the Berceuse and the Allegro de Concert. It also offers a live recording of Chopin’s Piano Sonata No. 3, taken from a 1947 recital at Carnegie Hall and issued here for the first time.

In all these Chopin works Reisenberg’s playing is exceptionally beautiful, distinguished by warm tone, impressive clarity, unostentatious virtuosity and unerring musical insight. The set contains charmingly personal liner notes by Robert Sherman, the radio announcer and producer of classical music programs. Mr. Sherman is something of a Reisenberg expert; she was his mother.

Mr. Sherman’s essay gives an overview of Reisenberg’s life and career. Born in Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1904, she studied piano at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in Russia and toured Eastern Europe and Germany before coming to New York in 1922. She made her American debut playing Paderewski’s “Fantasie Polonaise” with the New York City Symphony Orchestra, with Paderewski in attendance.

At first she developed a reputation as a contemporary-music specialist, giving first American performances of works by Schoenberg and Stravinsky. When for a New York Philharmonic concert the conductor John Barbirolli asked her to play the premiere of a difficult concerto by Mischa Portnoff, a composer who also worked in Hollywood, Reisenberg readily accepted the challenge.

She played chamber music, her first love, with the Budapest String Quartet, the principal players of the Philharmonic and other leading musicians, including Benny Goodman, with whom she made her first LP recording: Brahms’s E flat Clarinet Sonata.

Though she never considered herself a Chopin specialist, her performances here are masterly. There is an affecting directness to her playing. She conveys the jerky rhythmic tugs and pulls of the mazurkas, Chopin’s boldly inventive evocations of the Polish dance form. Yet for all the rhythmic freedom of the playing, there is an utterly natural lilt and flow.

The performances of the nocturnes are particularly fine, played with pearly sound, melting lyricism and textural clarity. For some listeners the honesty and deference Reisenberg brings to these pensive yet moody works may be a little too self-effacing. In a 1957 review of the original Westminster recordings of the Chopin nocturnes, Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times, while praising Reisenberg for her accuracy, clarity, musicianship and style, nevertheless found the performances “too perfect and hence lifeless.”

“Seldom does one feel that the pianist is being carried away,” Schonberg wrote, adding that he almost longed “for a touch of disarray.”

Though I can understand why Schonberg, a great admirer of pianists with Romantic approaches, might have found Reisenberg’s playing self-contained, I disagree. Her affecting deference conveys her total respect for the music. There is nothing showy in her pianism, nothing cloying about her expressivity. The performances are direct, sensitive and elegant.

She must have been an ideal mentor to Mr. Goode because his playing, like hers, has long been admired for its clarity and integrity. And like his teacher, Mr. Goode is taken for granted among some segments of the audience, especially piano buffs who are wowed by white-hot virtuosity.

In his liner notes Mr. Sherman explains that in 1956, during the weeks when Reisenberg was preparing and recording the Chopin nocturnes, she was grieving over the recent death of her husband, Isaac J. Sherman, a businessman with a love of music who thoroughly supported her work. She refused to postpone the sessions. Robert Sherman quotes from interviews with his mother’s sisters, who were with her at home as she “practiced and cried, cried and practiced.”

Mr. Sherman was wary about including the live account of the difficult Chopin sonata in this Bridge release. The performance captures Reisenberg at her most impetuous. This is a blazing, exhilarating performance with occasional smudged passages or crashing chords full of wrong notes. But it does not matter. The second movement, a dashing scherzo taken at a breathless, almost dangerous clip, is dispatched with uncanny lightness and near-perfect clarity. Reisenberg’s resourceful technique never fails her. It’s just that on this day, in this sonata, she let loose her wild side, and it is a treat to hear.

She might not have felt that way though. In 1957, tired of traveling on the concert circuit and beginning to experience insecurity about memorization, Reisenberg went into semiretirement. She ceased playing recitals and concerto performances and devoted herself to teaching. But she continued to play chamber music.

In a recent interview Mr. Sherman described hearing remastered tapes of a recording Reisenberg made of the two Brahms viola sonatas with the great violist Paul Doktor, and there are also remastered accounts of a Mendelssohn trio and a Fauré piano quartet from a concert Reisenberg participated in at the Library of Congress, all lined up for potential release.

Remastered recordings of Reisenberg’s Mozart concerto broadcasts are now being maintained by the International Piano Archives at Maryland, though there are no plans yet to release them commercially. Perhaps this “Chopin Treasury,” which truly is a treasure, will build demand for Reisenberg’s self-effacing and distinguished artistry.
99 2009-01-05 Usually a deal worth publishing will have one good point, but the diagramed deal has two. It occurred during the qualifying round of the Truscott Board-a-Match Teams at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in New York last week.

How would South play in three no-trump and in five diamonds after West leads the spade jack?

South’s opening bid was not automatic with only 10 high-card points, the minors and relatively weak suits. But he did have two aces, and opening is usually safer than passing first and overcalling later.

North’s two-spade rebid was fourth-suit game-forcing. An immediate jump to three diamonds would have been only game-invitational. Then, when North showed primary diamond support, South might have rebid three no-trump to indicate his spade stopper.

In three no-trump you hope to take these nine tricks: two spades, five diamonds and two clubs. So you win the first trick in your hand and lead the diamond queen. Your only legitimate chance to bring in the diamond suit without loss is to find East with a singleton jack. Also, West might “forget” to cover with his king.

However, let’s assume West plays the king. You win with dummy’s ace and lead another diamond, East taking the trick and returning a spade to dummy’s king. Now you have no option but to run the diamonds. What does East discard? He can throw two hearts, but on the last diamond he is squeezed in three suits. If he throws a club, that suit runs. If he pitches the heart ace, dummy has two winners. So he has to release a spade. But now you can drive out the heart ace because the opponents can cash only two spades.

Albert Shekhter of New York was in five diamonds after the given auction. He seemed to have three losers: one heart, one diamond and one club. But he made one of them disappear.

South, after taking the spade lead in his hand, played a heart to dummy’s queen and East’s ace. Back came a spade to dummy’s king. Declarer cashed the heart king, discarding a club from his hand, ruffed a heart, played a club to dummy’s king, returned a club to his hand and led a diamond to dummy’s ace to give this position (see Diagram 2):

Now came dummy’s last heart, East ruffing and South overruffing. Then a diamond lead endplayed West. On his major-suit return, declarer discarded dummy’s last club and ruffed in his hand.

117 2009-01-06 Mr. Laine’s challenge to small-business owners is this: “Don’t grow your company. Outsource. Be careful and recruit only people who fit in your corporate culture. But don’t grow if you want to keep your people happy.”

PSYCHIC SATISFACTION ZeroMillion.com, a Web site that offers resources for entrepreneurs, notes that staying small can reduce your concerns, especially if you tightly limit the size of your business.

“The mom-and-pop or one-person operation only has to worry about themselves, not employees,” it says. “If we have a bad month, someone else is not depending on us to pay them. We tighten our belts and work harder next month.”

And, of course, it is easier to take risks. “We can go with our creative ideas. We don’t have anyone to answer to anyone but ourselves. So our creative process doesn’t need to go through channels or get someone else’s approval.”

Fewer clients, more money. Aaron Wall, writing on his blog SEObook.com, offers a simple and potentially profitable strategy for staying small.

“Decide which clients make you the most money, and cut the rest.”

ADVANTAGES FOR YOU Seth Godin outlines on his blog some of the advantages for entrepreneurs who keep the growth of their businesses in check.

“Small means the founder makes a far greater percentage of the customer interactions,” he writes. “Small means the founder is close to the decisions that matter and can make them quickly. Small is the new big because small gives you the flexibility to change the business model when your competition changes theirs.

“Small means that you will outsource the boring, low-impact stuff like manufacturing and shipping and billing and packing to others, while you keep the power because you invent the remarkable and tell stories to people who want to hear them.”

Coincidence? Small Business Labs, which describes itself as focusing “on the key social, technology and business trends impacting small business,” has noticed something interesting:

“Small-business owners often use words like ‘freedom, independence, balance, flexibility’ when describing why they like being a small-business person. They use the same words when describing why they want to remain small.”

LAST CALL There is, of course, an ecological benefit if you can operate your business out of your home, as Tony D. Clark points out with his tongue firmly in his cheek. As he notes: “Rather than sitting in traffic, spewing out carbon into the atmosphere, you simply walk up the stairs, or into the other room. No pollution, no road rage, just natural human energy (though this may be your only exercise).”

And then there is this: “Most home-based entrepreneurs are so involved with their ventures, that they often forget some basic things. Showering comes to mind. That 5 or 10 minutes could be better used to follow up on an e-mail, and at the same time, conserves water and helps the planet.”

125 2009-01-06 The Buckeyes had taken a 21-17 lead with 2 minutes 5 seconds left when Daniel Herron burst through a huge hole in the left side of the line. It capped their unlikely rally from an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit.

But as it turned out, it left too much time for McCoy, who was 41 for 58 for 414 yards. He threw two touchdown passes, ran for another score, was intercepted once, was sacked four times and was hit many more — including twice on hits that were ruled personal fouls.

Wherever he was on the field, the action seemed to follow as he channeled his inner Brett Favre.

“I don’t think he’s been hit like he was hit today,” Ohio State safety Malcolm Jenkins said. “But he’s one of the better quarterbacks in the nation. That’s not something that’s going to destroy his game. He did a good job of staying poised and making the throws he had to make.”

McCoy was 7 for 10 on the final drive, including a 3-yard pass to James Kirkendoll on fourth-and-3 at the Ohio State 43 that kept Texas alive by a matter of inches with 38 seconds left.

Two plays later, with the Buckeyes in an all-out blitz and all the receivers covered man-to-man with no help, McCoy hit Cosby with a slant. Safety Anderson Russell, who earlier had intercepted McCoy at the goal line, fell as he swiped at the ball. Cosby caught it, raced untouched and dove into the end zone.

“I went for the swipe on the ball,” Russell said. “I knew when I didn’t get it, he was gone because there we were in all-out man and there was nobody there.”

Cosby, a former minor league baseball player, caught 14 passes. The last one was the result of a conversation he and McCoy had earlier about what to do when the Buckeyes blitzed.

“He kind of said over and over, if I catch the same look, give me a slant behind the linebacker,” McCoy said. “If he comes, you just make that miss and we will score. I gave him a good ball and he made the play.”

Whether it was enough for Texas (12-1) to lay claim that it should be national champion is another matter.

Southern California, with its resounding defeat of Penn State in the Rose Bowl, and Utah, whose emphatic win over Alabama in the Sugar Bowl allowed it to finish the season as the only major college unbeaten team, had raised questions this week about whether the Utes and the Trojans should have been in the national championship game.

Texas entered Monday night hoping to make an even better case. The Longhorns had beaten Oklahoma, 45-35, which nevertheless was paired opposite Florida in Thursday night’s title game. They hoped that with a strong showing, and perhaps a lackluster Oklahoma win over Florida, they may earn a share of the title by winning the Associated Press news media poll.

In the final regular season poll, Texas had six first-place votes and Oklahoma had eight. If Florida loses, its 50 first-place votes will be there for the taking.

The question for Texas was whether they did enough.

Brown said they did, but his players were skeptical.

“It’s very unfortunate,” defensive end Brian Orakpo said. “It’s style points and who can run up the score. Tonight was about two great teams who played a great game.”

Though McCoy was outstanding, the Longhorns’ running was rendered moot and their point total was their lowest output of the season. And although their defense held Ohio State without a touchdown for three quarters, the other top 10 teams the Buckeyes played, Penn State and U.S.C., did so for four.

For the Buckeyes, it was a matter of earning back some respect that had been squandered in back-to-back routs at the hands of Florida and Louisiana State in the last two national championship games. Ohio State also flunked an early season litmus test when it was whipped by U.S.C.

As good as McCoy was with his arm, the Ohio State freshman Terrelle Pryor was not bad with his legs — or his hands. He rushed 15 times for 78 yards, most of it in the second half, and also caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Todd Boeckman that pulled Ohio State to 17-15 with 7:26 to play.

Ohio State pulled ahead when its defense forced a three-and-out, and Boeckman — with a couple of long passes — led the Buckeyes deep into Texas territory. When Herron’s touchdown run put Ohio State ahead, it set off a frenzied celebration on their sideline.

“He is strong-willed and he is a guy that’s very confident and he never thinks he is going to lose,” Brown said of his junior quarterback. “Tonight under a tremendous amount of pressure, he played as well as any quarterback can possibly play, especially the last drive. I mean, to me, that’s a Heisman-type drive.”

127 2009-01-06 As a beekeeper, I was drawn to “The Buzz of Bees, though Benign, Halts Caterpillars’ Munching” (Observatory, Dec. 30) and pleased to learn of another benefit of the remarkable honeybee. From there my eye descended to the item on “Tormenting Pollens.” There is an important connection. Honey is the perfect antidote to those pollens. In much of the world, it is understood that a teaspoon of local honey daily can immunize sufferers from the bothersome sneezing, runny nose and weeping eyes. It is yet another way in which the honeybee and her products are a boon to humans.
128 2009-01-06 Last month, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter wrapped up its two-year primary science phase, and Mars geologists are wallowing in a bounty of data.

“Technically and scientifically, it has certainly met our expectations,” said Alfred S. McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and principal investigator for the orbiter’s high-resolution camera.

Images taken by the camera, able to see features down to about a yard in size, have revealed details like rippled textures in what had looked like bland dusty regions, and researchers can now count tiny craters, enabling them to better estimate the age of terrains.

A sensitive spectrometer discovered rocks made of carbonate minerals, which may have formed when young Mars possessed a more benign environment: wet and maybe warm.

“That’s telling us something about the early history of Mars,” said Scott L. Murchie of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and principal investigator for the spectrometer.

Most of the carbonates were washed away by acidic waters in later epochs.

The orbiter will continue its observations, which will allow places to be photographed more than once to capture changes in the landscape.

Meanwhile, the two Martian rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, mark their fifth anniversary this month, far outliving their original three-month mission. Spirit has recently begun moving again after sitting still through the winter while Opportunity is crossing the plains en route to a 13.7-mile-wide crater named Endeavour, a journey that could take at least another two years.
129 2009-01-06 “It’s the same well-connected big-money people who are now funding the inaugural,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist with Public Citizen. “What they get is a chance to influence policy or get government contracts or earmarks.”

Linda Douglass, a spokeswoman for the Obama inaugural committee, disputed that notion and said donors could not buy access.

“No one who has contributed to President-elect Obama has ever been led to believe that they’re going to have any special influence with him,” Ms. Douglass said. “He is passionately committed to changing business as usual and breaking the grip of special interests on government.”

The committee’s donor disclosures are a first for an incoming administration. The committee has also banned donations from corporations, unions and lobbyists. It limits donations from individuals to $50,000, which is lower than the $250,000 limit set by Mr. Bush and higher than the $100 set by Bill Clinton in 1997. (Mr. Clinton carried over a $9 million surplus from his 1993 inauguration, when he accepted six-figure donations.) The Obama team also limits contributions from bundlers to $300,000.

But while the limits may be tighter than in previous years, there are ways around them.

Elizabeth Bagley, an ambassador to Portugal in the Clinton administration and a longtime backer of Mrs. Clinton, has bundled the maximum $300,000 for Mr. Obama’s inauguration; so has her husband, Smith Bagley, for a family bundle of $600,000. Mr. Soros gave the maximum $50,000 individual contribution, as did four members of his family, for a total Soros donation of $250,000.

Other Clinton supporters now on board with Mr. Obama include Magic Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers star, and Robert Zimmerman, a longtime Clinton backer from Long Island.

While the inauguration committee bars money from corporations, it accepts money from corporate executives, who can give as individuals.

Top executives from Microsoft, for example, have given a total of $300,000, and those from Google have given $150,000. Officials from several other technology and telecommunications companies have also contributed, including Robert Glaser, chairman of RealNetworks Inc.; Irwin Jacobs, founder of Qualcomm; and Chad Hurley, a founder of YouTube.

During the campaign, employees of Microsoft gave Mr. Obama $714,000, and employees of Google gave $704,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Forty-seven donors raised more than $500,000 in the campaign; half of them are now bundlers for the inauguration.

Hollywood gave liberally to Mr. Obama’s campaign and is giving again. In addition to Mr. Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw, the donors include Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn; the actress Jamie Lee Curtis and her husband, Christopher Guest (director of “A Mighty Wind”); the actress Sharon Stone; and the actors Tom Hanks, Samuel L. Jackson and Jamie Foxx.

Mr. Cohen, a senior researcher at Public Citizen, lauded the inauguration committee for disclosing its list of donors, doing it in a timely manner and limiting the amounts. But he said the list shows that money remains a powerful force in politics.

“The problem isn’t just corporations and lobbyists, it’s influence in general and who has it and who doesn’t,” Mr. Cohen said.

Ms. Douglass of the committee said the expenses this year would be greater than those for any previous inauguration. In modern times, inaugurations have been financed by a combination of public and private money. In 2005, Mr. Bush raised $42.3 million from about 15,000 donors for festivities; the federal government and the District of Columbia spent a combined $115.5 million, most of it for security, the swearing-in ceremony, cleanup and for a holiday for federal workers.

Still, only about 400,000 people attended in 2005, while officials expect at least two million this year. That means added costs for opening the whole Mall, setting up more JumboTrons and providing 5,000 portable toilets, among other items. (The District of Columbia alone spent more than $15 million in 2005 and says costs this year will triple.)

The Obama team is planning a full schedule of events, both for the public and for donors. They include a procession by train into Washington from Philadelphia on Saturday and a dinner for top financial contributors that night; brunch on Sunday for donors and a public welcoming concert at the Lincoln Memorial; a political briefing on Monday for donors and a day of community service, followed by a youth concert at the Verizon Center as well as an invitation-only bipartisan dinner; the traditional inauguration ceremonies on Tuesday, followed by a parade and 10 balls at night, one more than Mr. Bush and four fewer than Mr. Clinton. One of the official Obama balls is a “neighborhood” ball open to the public.

During the campaign, small donors supplied about a quarter of the record-shattering $745 million that Mr. Obama raised. But campaign finance experts doubt that the same enthusiasm exists for giving to the inauguration.

Fred Wertheimer, a longtime campaign finance expert in Washington, advocates that the government pay the entire bill.

“Even when you have an Obama administration that has taken steps beyond what other previous inaugurals have done to provide immediate transparency and limits on fund-raisers, you still inevitably wind up with larger donors and bundlers with the potential to gain access and influence,” Mr. Wertheimer said. “At a minimum, it raises appearance questions.”
130 2009-01-06 “A lot of people are talking about dollar-a-gallon gasoline, when the wholesale market seems to be pointing to $2 a gallon,” said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. As of Monday, regular gasoline was selling for $1.67 a gallon, on average, up from a recent low of $1.62 on Dec. 30.

The decline in gasoline prices has offered badly needed relief to consumers. A driver buying 50 gallons of gasoline a month has been saving $2 a day compared to a year ago, and $4 a day compared to the price peak in July. For the national economy as a whole, the savings came to around $1 billion a day, according to the Oil Price Information Service.

Among the big winners have been businesses like shipping companies with large transportation costs, commuters who drive long distances to work and consumers with moderate incomes who spend a relatively high percentage of their paychecks on fuel.

The summer’s high prices prompted Americans to cut their driving, and the drastic downturn of the economy this fall led to the huge decline in oil prices. But with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cutting production, and with refineries trimming their output of gasoline, supply and demand may be coming back into balance.

Refineries have cut the number of barrels of crude oil they processed weekly to 14.5 million during December, from 15.4 million, according to the Energy Department. The tighter supplies are putting pressure on retail prices.

Analysts say the decline in gasoline use may have bottomed out, barring a further big downturn in the economy. MasterCard’s SpendingPulse data service, which measures both cash and credit card sales of gasoline, had shown volume declines as sharp as 9 percent during some weeks in the fall. But that number has narrowed considerably as prices have fallen, and one recent week even showed a slight increase in gasoline sales compared to the same week the year before.

“There will be a real spike in gasoline prices coming in the next four to six weeks,” predicted Chris Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, a brokerage and research firm. “We are witnessing a sea change in energy market sentiment as Americans appear to be returning to some of their old driving habits just as geopolitical risk is once again a factor in crude prices.”

Oil prices jumped more than 5 percent on Monday alone to close at $48.81 in New York trading, as fighting continued in the Gaza Strip and Iran’s OPEC representative said the cartel would hold a special meeting in February. The cartel decided last month to cut output by 2.2 million barrels, on top of earlier cutbacks.

The AAA auto club reported that the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline on Monday was $1.67, up nearly a penny and a half from the day before. That still compares favorably to the national average of $3.10 a gallon a year ago and the record high national average price of $4.11 last July 17.

In contrast to gasoline, diesel prices have not yet bottomed out. A gallon cost $2.40 on Monday, down a fraction of a penny from the day before.

Mr. Kloza said he thought gasoline prices probably hit a bottom last month. He said gasoline prices in California, which frequently leads the rest of the nation in gasoline price swings, bottomed the first week of December and had been rising since.

While gasoline prices felt like a great weight to many consumers on the way up, they have not been an economic cure-all on the way down.

“In comparison with between roughly a 40 percent drop in the stock market and a 20 percent drop in home values, the drop in gasoline prices is just a drop in the bucket,” said Adam J. Robinson, director of commodities at Armored Wolf L.L.C., a hedge fund.

Mr. Robinson said he was unconvinced that oil and gasoline prices would go back up for long. “I think it is too soon to call a bottom in oil or gasoline because demand is falling faster than OPEC is cutting,” he said.
131 2009-01-06 What the studies do show, Dr. Ozner said, is that putting stents in such patients is no more protective than following a heart-healthy lifestyle and taking medication and, if necessary, nutritional supplements to reduce cardiac risk. The studies have also shown that stents sometimes make matters worse by increasing the chance that a dangerous clot will form in a coronary artery, as noted in 2006 by an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration.

Dr. Ozner, medical director of the Cardiovascular Prevention Institute of South Florida, is one of many prevention-oriented cardiologists vocal about the overuse of “interventional cardiology,” a specialty involving invasive coronary treatments that have become lucrative for the hospitals and doctors who perform them.

Even some interventional cardiologists have expressed concern about the many patients without symptoms who are treated surgically. “The only justification for these procedures is to prolong life or improve the quality of life,” said Dr. David L. Brown, an interventional cardiologist and chief of cardiology at Stony Brook University Medical Center, “and there are plenty of patients undergoing them who fit into neither category.”

The treatments — coronary artery bypass surgery, angioplasty and the placement of drug-coated stents — cost about $60 billion a year in the United States. Though they are not known to prevent heart attacks or coronary mortality in most patients, they are covered by insurance. Counseling patients about diet, exercise and stress management — which is relatively inexpensive and has been proved to be life-extending — is rarely reimbursed. In other words, procedure-oriented modern cardiology is pound wise and penny foolish. And in these economic times, it makes great sense to reconsider the approaches to reducing morbidity and mortality from the nation’s leading killer.

Most people mistakenly think of coronary artery disease as a plumbing problem. Influenced by genetics, diet, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and other factors, major arteries through which oxygen-rich blood flows to the heart gradually become narrowed by deposits of cholesterol-rich plaques until blood can no longer pass through, resulting in a heart attack.

In coronary bypass surgery, a blood vessel taken from elsewhere in the body is reattached to a clogged coronary artery to bypass the narrowed part.

However, as Dr. Ozner points out in his book, “three major studies performed in the late 1970s and early 1980s clearly proved that for the majority of patients, bypass surgery is no more effective than conservative medical treatment.” The exceptions — patients whose health and lives could be saved — were those with advanced disease of the left main coronary artery and those with severe crippling, or unstable, angina.

Bypass surgery does relieve the pain of angina, though recent studies suggest this may happen because pain receptors around the heart are destroyed during surgery.

“The studies on angioplasty delivered even worse news,” Dr. Ozner wrote. “Unless the patient was in the midst of a heart attack, the opening of a blocked coronary artery with a balloon catheter resulted in a worse outcome compared to management through medication.” In fact, one trial, published in 2003 in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, found that balloon angioplasty, which flattens plaque against arterial walls, actually raised the risk of a heart attack or death.

Stents were designed to keep the flattened plaque in place. But studies of stable patients found no greater protection against heart attacks from stents than from treatments like making lifestyle changes and taking drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure.

A new understanding of how most heart attacks occur suggests why these procedures have not lived up to their promise. According to current evidence, most heart attacks do not occur because an artery is closed by a large plaque. Rather, a relatively small, unstable plaque ruptures and attracts inflammatory cells and coagulating agents, leading to an artery-blocking clot.

In most Americans middle age and older, small plaques are ubiquitous in coronary arteries and there is no surgical way to treat them all.

“Interventional cardiology is doing cosmetic surgery on the coronary arteries, making them look pretty, but it’s not treating the underlying biology of these arteries,” said Dr. Ozner, who received the 2008 American Heart Association Humanitarian Award. “If some of the billions spent on intervention were put into prevention, we’d have a much healthier America at a lower cost.”

Dr. Ozner advises patients who are told they need surgery to get an independent second opinion from a specialist.
132 2009-01-06 The Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Scotland’s annual celebration of comedy, drama and performing arts, may be forced to shut down its popular Fringe Sunday event because of a money shortage, the BBC reported. As it prepares for the 2009 festival in August, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society is facing significant shortfalls as the costs of the event have increased. Also, ticket sales for last year’s festival were down by 10 percent after several malfunctions at the box office. The festival recently received a loan of about $180,000 from the Edinburgh City Council and two grants for about the same amount but is still seeking a sponsor for its Sunday celebration. A spokesman told the BBC that a final decision about the future of the Sunday event had not yet been made.
133 2009-01-06 In July, by a vote of 10 to 3, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in , reversed Mr. Stevens’s conviction and struck down the law, saying it violated the constitutional right to free speech.

Last month, the United States solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. “Depictions of the intentional infliction of suffering on vulnerable creatures,” the brief said, “play no essential role in the expression of ideas.” The First Amendment, the brief went on, is therefore irrelevant to the case.

Unlike private litigants, who face long odds in persuading the court to hear their cases, the solicitor general’s success rate is between 50 percent and 70 percent. Perhaps even more important, the case involves a federal statute that has been held unconstitutional.

“The general rule of thumb,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown, “is that if one branch is going to hold another branch’s conduct unconstitutional, it ought to be the Supreme Court.”

The videos Mr. Stevens sold sound disturbing. But some of what they show took place decades ago or in , where appears to be legal. Neither point matters under the 1999 law, which requires only that the activities shown be illegal where the video was bought or sold.

That means it may well be a crime for an American to sell a video of a bullfight that took place in , where bullfighting is legal, or of hunting or out of season.

“It is hard to imagine,” Mr. Stevens’s lawyers told the appeals court, “how the of depictions of conduct which occurred a long time ago, at a time when it was not even illegal, or in a country where it is not illegal, can prevent animal cruelty here and now, at a time and a place where it is illegal.”

The law does contain an exception for materials of “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical or artistic value.” But Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment specialist at the University of California, , said the exception was small comfort. “What constitutes serious value,” Professor Volokh said, “is very much in the eye of the beholder.”

When President signed the bill into law, he issued a statement instructing the Justice Department to limit prosecutions to “wanton cruelty to animals designed to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.”

Whatever else may be said of presidential signing statements, they do not bind the next administration. The current Justice Department has pursued at least three prosecutions under the law, all involving videos of dogfights.

There are only a few categories of speech wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment, including fighting words, some kinds of incitement, obscenity and, starting in 1982, nonobscene pornography involving children.

That last was a major constitutional shift, said Amy Adler, a law professor at . , she wrote in The Law Review in 2001, “is the only place in First Amendment law were the Supreme Court has accepted the idea that we can constitutionally criminalize the depiction of a crime.”

In an interview, Professor Adler said that several of the reasons offered for making the distribution of child pornography a crime did not offer much support for the animal cruelty law. “It’s hard to say we’re going to dry up the market for bullfighting in Spain,” for example, she said.

Along similar lines, Judge D. Brooks Smith, writing for the appeals court majority, said animals did not experience shame and other psychological harm. “While animals are sentient creatures worthy of human kindness and human care,” he wrote, “one cannot seriously contend that the animals themselves suffer continuing harms by having their images out in the marketplace.”

Professor Volokh, who said he believed the law was unconstitutional, offered a prediction about its fate in the Supreme Court. “I think they’re going to strike it down,” he said. “It’s going to be at least 6-3, perhaps even unanimous.”

But even free speech absolutists might find their beliefs tested by the “crush videos” that initially prompted the law.

Before the 1999 law was enacted, according to the , there were some 2,000 crush videos available in the marketplace, for $15 to $300 each. After 1999, said Jonathan R. Lovvorn, chief counsel of the Humane Society, that market all but disappeared.

But since July, Mr. Lovvorn said, crush videos have “popped back up on the Internet as a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling.”

Mr. Lovvorn provided a reporter with links to two examples, one involving a kitten, the other a puppy. May you never see them.
134 2009-01-06 Mr. Schiller is among several Apple executives who have been mentioned as potential successors to Mr. Jobs. Others include Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, and Jonathan Ive, its senior vice president of industrial design.

But the stock’s substantial fluctuations on each tidbit of news and rumor about Mr. Jobs’s health underscore just how difficult it will be for anyone to succeed him at Apple, a company he co-founded in 1976 and has led to a remarkable resurgence in the last decade.

“People are spooked by these health reports because he is so important to Apple and is viewed as synonymous with the company by so many people,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.

In his letter on Monday, Mr. Jobs reassured investors, and Apple’s adoring fan base, that “I will be the first one to step up and tell our board of directors if I can no longer continue to fulfill my duties as Apple’s C.E.O.”

Mr. Jobs had a treatable form of pancreatic cancer four years ago and underwent a surgical process called a Whipple procedure, which removes about 70 percent of the pancreas.

A side effect from that procedure may have contributed to the current problem, said Dr. Richard M. Goldberg, a specialist in pancreatic cancer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has no personal knowledge of Mr. Jobs’s medical history.

The reduction in size of the pancreas can prevent it from making enough fat-digesting enzymes and make it more difficult for patients to absorb foods that contain fat, Dr. Goldberg said. Patients can avoid this by taking enzymes for the rest of their lives, but the dose has to be carefully adjusted at every meal depending on the fat content of the food, he said.

Dr. Goldberg said that he had no reason to believe that Mr. Jobs’s cancer was not cured. But he said other people with similar cancers had lost weight after the Whipple procedure because cancer cells had been left behind and churned out excessive amounts of the hormones that manage blood sugar balance or regulate digestion.

Mr. Jobs’s illness has raised legal questions about what Apple is required to disclose about his health.

Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School and a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said there was little agreement among legal scholars about the responsibilities of a company when its chief executive became ill.

“Among the arguments that are made is that the C.E.O. has certain privacy rights,” Mr. Grundfest said. “The counterargument to that is there is nothing in federal securities laws about privacy rights.”

In a separate statement, the board of Apple said that Mr. Jobs deserved the company’s support during his recuperation and vowed to inform the public if his tenure at Apple was indeed ending. “As we have said before, if there ever comes a day when Steve wants to retire or for other reasons cannot continue to fulfill his duties as Apple’s C.E.O., you will know it,” the statement read.

Expectations that Mr. Schiller will use his Macworld speech to announce a major new product are low, although analysts say they expect the company to upgrade its line of iMac desktop computers and give an early preview of Snow Leopard, the next version of its operating system.
135 2009-01-06 Shares of Ford Motor and General Motors finished higher after the Big Three automakers announced their worst sales totals in nearly 50 years. While the figures were bleak, analysts had been bracing for even worse reports. Shares of Ford rose 12 cents, to $2.58, while G.M. gained 6 cents, to $3.71.

Ford said its sales sank 32 percent in December, while G.M. reported a drop of 31 percent. Chrysler said that its sales plummeted 53 percent last month. Toyota and Honda reported that their sales in the United States fell by more than 30 percent.

Shares of Apple rose more than 4 percent, or $3.83, to $94.58, after Steven P. Jobs, the computer maker’s chief executive, released a letter addressing concerns about his health that have persisted since he decided not to make a keynote appearance at the annual Macworld Conference this week.

Mr. Jobs said a hormone imbalance had been “robbing” his body of necessary proteins, but he said he had begun treatment and would remain at Apple’s helm.

Despite the housing slump and restricted credit for building loans, construction spending in November was stronger than economists had expected. Spending dropped by 0.6 percent, less than an expected 1.3 percent decline, the Commerce Department reported Monday.

Overall spending was pulled down by a 4 percent decline in spending on home building, but nonresidential construction rose 1 percent from October.

“This is just a matter of time, though, because the lead time for construction projects is long and the credit crunch has not yet had time to make itself felt in full,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. Sooner or later, he said, nonresidential construction “will fall very sharply indeed.”

Crude oil prices extended their rally, rising $2.47, to settle at $48.81 a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.

Although oil prices are still down sharply from their July peak of more than $145 a barrel, they have risen nearly 20 percent over the last week, from $40 a barrel last Monday, as Russia shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and new fighting in Gaza unsettled the Middle East.

The price of long-term government debt, which spiked in November and December as investors fled from riskier investments, fell on Monday.

Yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries have rebounded from record lows and worries about vast new issues of government and corporate debt.

The yield on a 30-year Treasury bond, which increases as the price falls, rose above 3 percent for the first time since mid-December.

“We were at all-time low yield levels, and once the buying dried up, there wasn’t anybody there to protect the market,” said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies and Company. “I think there’s great worry about supply coming.”

The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 1 1/32, to 111 1/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.48 percent, up from 2.37 percent late Friday.

Asian markets began the day higher on Tuesday after gaining ground on Monday. The Nikkei 225 stock average rose 1 percent in early trading on Tuesday in Tokyo.

163 2009-01-07 DETROIT — After Nissan said in November than it would skip this year’s North American International Auto Show, which opens here next week, a group of Nissan dealers decided they would provide staff members to run an exhibit for the company. That way, their cars would at least be on display at the show. But the dealers have canceled those plans, at Nissan’s request.

Doug Fox, owner of a Nissan dealership in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a co-chairman of the auto show, said the dealers were surprised by the company’s disapproval but agreed to pull out.

“They said they would really appreciate it if we would respect their decision not to be present at N.A.I.A.S. this year in any way, shape or form,” Mr. Fox said. “If that’s the way corporate feels, obviously we weren’t going to push the issue any further. As dealers, we thought we were doing the right thing to create a presence.”

A Nissan spokesman, Brian Brockman, confirmed the request but declined to say why the company had not wanted its dealers to have a display. In its original announcement, Nissan said it was bypassing Detroit, as well as the Chicago auto show, “based on the fact that we have no major new products to show” and because of “the current economic conditions which will impact the shows’ marketing effectiveness.”

Since then, the company has changed its mind about Chicago, leaving Detroit as the only show off Nissan’s schedule. “We worked with our Chicago-area dealers and came up with a good creative solution that we could maintain a presence while still having an eye toward the challenging market out there,” Mr. Brockman said.

Patrick Olsen, editor in chief of Cars.com, a Web site that provides car-buying advice for consumers, said it was understandable that Nissan, which like other automakers was grappling with the worst selling environment in at least 25 years, would be trying to save money. But he said that letting the dealers operate their own display would have cost the company nothing.
164 2009-01-07 It is unfortunate that so many fiduciaries (including managers of foundations, endowments and funds) could invest so much money with Bernard L. Madoff apparently without performing fundamental, common-sense due diligence. The red flags were numerous, including a serious lack of transparency, a tiny storefront auditor and uncannily smooth and consistent returns.

The whole affair confirms what Stephen J. Brown, Bing Liang and I conclude in a paper published recently in The Journal of Investment Management: basic due diligence on the operations of a money manager is a fundamental part of a fiduciary’s duties and can have a direct impact on investment return.

I find the proposal by Michael Lewis and David Einhorn on foreclosures to be irresponsible. After suggesting that making payments on mortgages greater than the current values of homes “doesn’t make sense,” they propose a universal plan for requiring banks to accept the current value in the form of a new taxpayer-provided loan to the homeowner.

They would also void second mortgages, subordinate home equity loans and allow this to apply to all, wealthy speculators included, by not requiring bankruptcy of the recipient of this taxpayer largess.

“Moral hazard” is not an empty phrase. Its avoidance preserves the values of fairness that a government and economic system rest upon. What we really need is a serious discussion of housing policy, now and in the future.

The fact that the current appraised value of a home is less than its mortgage isn’t reason to default. A homeowner will default if he took out a teaser rate mortgage that reset or speculated by buying various “investment” properties. Shouldn’t he suffer the consequences of his poor decisions?

If someone was misled into taking a teaser loan but did so in good faith, intending to make payments, and was then unable to do so because of an unexpected jump in monthly payments, maybe that person should be eligible for a loan modification. But are there really 20 million such families out there?

House prices will stop declining when you can buy a house, rent it and carry it for free. When that price is reached, capitalists will rush in and start buying properties again, creating a bottom. Why shouldn’t the market be allowed to clear itself?

Michael Lewis and David Einhorn write that the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed “measures that fail to address the central problem: that the raters are paid by the issuers.” They say, “There should be a rule against issuers paying for ratings.”

It would be a great mistake for the S.E.C., in its enthusiasm for taking corrective action, to end the official status of certain rating agencies, for such an action would result in the elimination of any standards for rating agencies, thereby encouraging the proliferation of unregulated rating agencies and contributing to the problem of credit ratings quality.

Egan-Jones is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (the official status that the authors would like to end) that rates a wide range of corporate and other issuers of debt obligations. Our revenues are entirely derived from institutional investors, rather than issuers, and thus avoid irreconcilable conflicts of interest.

I disagree that employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission should be barred from accepting jobs at Wall Street firms. Such a prohibition would deeply harm the S.E.C.’s ability to attract top legal talent. Any law student who can secure an S.E.C. position undoubtedly had offers to make three times as much from a large law firm.

I worked as a legal intern for a summer at the Federal Trade Commission, a federal agency where young lawyers left almost weekly to go to large law firms through a similar revolving door. They did so not because they were greedy, but because their law school debt was so high — often $200,000 — that staying in the job meant choosing between paying only interest on their debt or living in their parents’ house.

If the government is serious about retaining talent at its agencies, it should use the carrot, not the stick. For starters, employees should be able to make no student loan payments for the first few years of service (interest free) and receive complete loan forgiveness after a set period (say, five years). This would enable idealistic regulators to stay.

I hope President-elect Barack Obama pays heed to the thoughtful advice of Michael Lewis and David Einhorn. How can we recover economically if the government keeps trying to treat the symptoms and not the disease itself?
165 2009-01-07 ISTANBUL — Azerbaijan has begun to enforce a law that bans foreign companies from broadcasting on national frequencies, effectively closing its airwaves to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Voice of America and the BBC.

Foreign companies are still permitted to broadcast on shortwaves, satellite and cable, according to Ali M. Hasanov, an official in Azerbaijan’s presidential administration.

“They can broadcast any way they like, except for on our national FM frequency,” Mr. Hasanov said by telephone from Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital.

But Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, an American-government-financed radio and television broadcaster with representation in most countries of the former Soviet Union, argues that FM was the primary way Azeris heard its programming, and that taking it away has cut off 90 percent of its audience.

Jeffrey Gedmin, president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, based in Prague, said that shortwave and Internet radio would not make up the difference, as Azeris had limited access to both, and said the change had left Azeris “without access to free and independent media.”
166 2009-01-07 “Economically, it was a very tough decade for baseball,” said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at .

As Americans grapple with what could be the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, many are asking whether major league baseball, and professional sports more broadly, will prove impervious to the grim realities of the economic cycle, or will suffer as teams did then.

Optimists point to the shallow dips in attendance in past recessions, guaranteed television contracts, lucrative sponsorship deals and new luxury boxes in modern stadiums. These revenue streams were largely unavailable to owners in the 1930s and have helped modern teams diversify and bolster their incomes.

Optimists also point to the large free-agent contracts signed by , A. J. Burnett, Mark Teixeira and Francisco Rodríguez this winter — evidence, they say, that shows that at least the strong teams have the wherewithal to withstand a severe slowdown.

But Zimbalist and others who have studied the history of the game said the last few recessions were mild enough that even the weakest teams got by. This slump, he said, is more analogous to the economic chaos of the 1930s, and historians should look to that era for hints on how teams will hold up in the coming years.

Clearly, times were tough, though the owners were slow to recognize what was to come. The stock market crashed in October 1929, but baseball enjoyed record attendance the next year, with more than 10 million fans passing through the turnstiles.

At their winter meetings after the 1930 season, the owners made no significant changes or concessions. The National League owners, however, did take the time to note that 5,145 dozen baseballs were used that year, a 10 percent increase, which disturbed their thrifty impulses.

As the 1931 season dawned, Frank J. Navin, the acting American League president and the owner of the , saw no sign of the impending collapse.

“Former business depressions have not hurt baseball,” he told The Associated Press, “and I do not think the present depression will materially affect attendance this year.”

But the hard times did arrive, and quickly. Attendance fell 16 percent in 1931, driven not just by rising unemployment but also a decision by the owners to dampen the scoring boom by changing the rules for what constituted a home run and tinkering with the composition of Spalding’s baseballs.

Attendance fell in 1932, when a 10 percent federal amusement tax was added to ticket prices, and again in 1933, when bank holidays left many Americans short of cash. President Herbert Hoover, an avid baseball fan, was lustily booed at games he attended. The hapless drew fewer than 100,000 fans for several seasons in the decade. On opening day in 1933, half the 40,000 fans at Yankee Stadium sat in the bleachers, where tickets were 50 cents, according to Charles C. Alexander, author of “Breaking the Slump: Baseball in the Depression Era,” which was published in 2002.

Many teams, strong and weak ones alike, kept costs down by reducing the number of coaches, or by eliminating them and employing player-managers. Owners opted for 23-man rosters, down from 25. Even the best players — Babe Ruth among them — took pay cuts. Connie Mack sold many of the stars from the pennant-winning teams of 1929, 1930 and 1931.

Only the two pennant-winning teams — the and the Yankees — made money in 1932. In 1933, only the New York Giants and the finished the season in the black.

The , which had gone deep into debt to expand Ebbets Field, received turn-off notices from the power company at its offices on Montague Street, according to Bob McGee, who wrote “The Greatest Ballpark Ever: Ebbets Field and the Story of the Brooklyn Dodgers,” which was published in 2005.

Some weaker teams survived partly because they received a share of the gate when they played against popular teams like the Yankees, the Cubs and the Giants.

Despite the need for new sources of revenue, many of baseball’s hidebound owners continued to resist allowing live radio broadcasts of their games, fearing fewer fans would attend in person. This attitude persisted even though radio had helped generate interest in, as well as money for, minor league teams.

“They finally came to the conclusion that, depression notwithstanding, they would do nothing drastic in the way of retrenchments that would seriously affect baseball’s time-honored customers or, as one owner expressed it, ‘cheapen’ the game,” John Drebinger of The wrote of the 1932 winter meetings.

Some owners, it seemed, lived in another world. Navin, the owner of the Tigers, bought a racehorse in 1931 even though his players were reportedly having their meal money reduced. Others focused on yachting.

Whatever the predilections of the owners, baseball’s fans, even those not attending games in person, took solace in the game. Pepper Martin, an outfielder on the 1931 championship team, became a folk hero for his scrappy play in the World Series.

Ruth added to his voluminous legend when he hit a home run at Wrigley Field in the 1932 World Series that, legend has it, he predicted in advance.

Dizzy Dean and his younger brother, Paul, were among the most chronicled players in 1934, as much for their down-home flamboyance as for their feats on the field.

“The times were tough for just about everybody, including the young men who tried to make their way as professional baseball players in a decade of persistently discouraging prospects in most kinds of employment,” Alexander wrote in “Breaking the Slump.”

“Yet the period featured a galaxy of memorable personalities and some of the most memorable baseball ever played.”

The Depression also forced teams to innovate. The Cardinals, for instance, expanded their network of minor league teams. Several teams, including the Cubs, did not charge women for admission, a promotion that East Coast teams soon copied.

A few teams generated income by allowing live radio broadcasts. Taking a cue from the minor leagues, the in 1935 became the first team to host a night game, which proved very popular with fans.

The end of the blue laws in also helped franchises in Philadelphia and , which, until 1934, had not been able to schedule home games on Sundays.

Remarkably, while thousands of banks collapsed during the Depression and millions of people lost their jobs, no major league baseball franchises folded or moved during the period (though at least two changed hands, including the ).

“The teams muddled through,” said Rodney Fort, a professor of sports management at the . “We know from this truly historic episode that things didn’t go to hell in a handbag.”
167 2009-01-07 The Indian unit of General Motors will raise its car prices by 1 to 2 percent to cover rising costs and does not expect the market to improve in the first half of 2009, a senior official said on Tuesday. The price increases were to cover input costs and the impact of the weakening of the rupee last year, P. Balendran, vice president at General Motors India, said. G.M. India, a wholly owned unit of General Motors, said last week it had missed its 2008 sales target of 75,000 units. Sales were 65,702, a rise of 9.5 percent from 2007. The company has not set a target for 2009 because of the uncertain market conditions. G.M. India, which has two manufacturing plants, plans to introduce three cars this year, starting later this month with a four-wheel-drive Chevrolet Captiva.
168 2009-01-07 The United States operations of LyondellBasell, a petrochemical company, filed for bankruptcy protection in New York on Tuesday, facing a huge debt load and slumping demand for its products.

The company took on billions of dollars in debt obligations a year ago, when the investor Len Blavatnik led a $12.7 billion leveraged buyout of Lyondell by Basell of the Netherlands.

The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing included almost 80 units of the company and encompassed its American operations and a European financing arm. The company’s operations are not included in the filing and are continuing to function as usual.

LyondellBasell Industries, which produces fuels, chemicals and plastics, is owned by Mr. Blavatnik through Access Industries and is based in the Netherlands.

The American operations have obtained $8 billion in debtor-in-possession financing to help pay for operations.
169 2009-01-07 Credit Suisse said it had injected 7.94 billion rupees ($164 million) into the operations of its nonbanking financial company in India. The money will raise the capital of Credit Suisse Finance (India), a wholly owned unit of Credit Suisse, to 8.27 billion rupees, the company said. It added that the funds would be used to provide asset-backed financing, securities-backed financing and lending related to initial public offerings.
170 2009-01-07 Yet the show, organized by Patterson Sims, departing director of the Montclair Art Museum, also offers proof that Mr. Pearlstein, 84, has been an artist of greater range than he has been credited for. Of the exhibition’s 41 works, only 13 are nudes (not counting a 1948 charcoal drawing from Mr. Pearlstein’s student years). The rest are portraits, landscapes and early works.

In some ways, the most interesting part of the show is the selection of works that predate his signature nudes. A small painting of a merry-go-round for which Mr. Pearlstein won first prize in a national student art competition in 1940, when he was in 11th grade, looks as though it had been painted by a Social Realist like Reginald Marsh. A carefully observed portrait of the Mr. Pearlstein’s father from 1946 is as arresting as any of the artist’s later portraits.

Maybe the most remarkable early piece is an image of a bulgingly muscular Superman painted in a roiling Expressionist style. Part of a series of canvases from 1949 to 1952 that were based on cartoon characters, it is a curious anticipation of Pop Art, a road not taken for Mr. Pearlstein.

In the late 1940s he and Andy Warhol were classmates at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). A small, sensitively delineated, mostly brown portrait of Warhol from a third-year painting class is in the show. They were briefly roommates in New York City when they moved there after graduation. In the early 1950s they went separate ways, but you can’t help but wonder what kind of influence Mr. Pearlstein’s “Superman” and similar paintings from that time might have had on Warhol.

As for Mr. Pearlstein, he abandoned pop-culture imagery and threw himself into nature and landscape. “Tree Roots” (1957) and “Imperial Palace #7” (1960), a picture of a Roman ruin, are made in a nondescript, Cézanne-esque Expressionist style. Their conventionality highlights what a daring leap Mr. Pearlstein was about to make.

It could be argued that there is something Warholian — if not overtly Pop — about the voyeuristic, coolly detached paintings of nude figures that Mr. Pearlstein began making in the early 1960s. Unfortunately, there are only two paintings from that breakthrough decade in the exhibition: one of a male and a female model from 1964, the other of two female models from 1965.

Paintings, watercolors and prints from the late 1970s and subsequent decades show how he progressively incorporated more antique objects into his nude paintings, thereby adding Cubist dimensions and the stylistic anticipation of Pop Art that he abandoned in the early ’50s. In “Two Models and Four Whirly-Gigs” (2007-8), the mix of organic female bodies, brightly colored toy wind machines and a multicolored checkerboard rug yields a gripping optical complexity.

Mr. Pearlstein’s portraits are not so exciting. The ones representing well-known people like the art historians Robert Rosenblum and Irving Sandler and the artist Scott Burton do benefit from the recognition factor, and a large 1967 painting of his two daughters, then 4 and 6, sitting on a chaise and looking bored to tears is unusually touching. But Mr. Pearlstein’s portraits are not nearly as innovative — formally or conceptually — as his naked figure paintings.

In landscape and cityscape, Mr. Pearlstein has been adept and industrious. A 6-foot-by-6-foot nocturnal picture of New York viewed from a 12th-floor window in 1992 is absorbingly complicated, luminous and spacious, and a 10-foot-wide woodcut from 1987-88 depicting the Kidron Valley in Jerusalem is technically impressive. But if it’s a question of contributing something original and influential to 20th-century art, only Mr. Pearlstein’s nudes will answer.
171 2009-01-07 As a result, said Scott Anderson, a Wells Fargo economist who also spoke to the assembly, Denver and its region are “in for a more mild recession” than the rest of the country.

While local office vacancy rates are rising — 13.1 percent at the end of the third quarter, up from 12.4 percent in the second quarter, according to the most recent CoStar Group report on the Denver office market — they stand below the national average, which was 13.6 percent in the third quarter, according to Reis Inc., a real estate research firm, and well below some other cities.

Still, absorption rates were negative in both the second and third quarters, meaning that more space came onto the market than was leased or bought. The rate was a negative 39,000 square feet in the third quarter, compared with a positive absorption of 43,000 square feet in the first quarter. In addition, more than one million square feet of new commercial space is expected to become available next year.

But a challenging time for the office market is expected to be mitigated somewhat by residential projects. Mr. Nichols told his audience that the Spire was aimed at downtown office professionals inclined to eschew the suburbs for convenient transit, recreation areas in the building where they lived, close-by shopping and cultural amenities and entertainment.

The Spire will begin sales in March with units starting at $200,000 and ranging to more than $500,000. Its 33,000 square feet of amenities, Mr. Nichols said, includes pools, barbecue grills and media rooms, and the building’s own fleet of bicycles. Retailing on the ground floor is expected to include an upscale restaurant-nightclub, a coffeehouse, a Pilates or yoga-oriented business and a car rental agency.

The tower is being built at 14th Street near Curtis Street, in the heart of the city’s new Theater District, a transformative project designed “in Times Square fashion” around the Convention Center and the city’s new Center for the Performing Arts.

The Theater District’s chairman, Walter L. Isenberg, a Denver-based hotel developer and president of the Sage Hospitality Group, envisions the new district as a bright-lights environment that will draw new retailing and restaurants and attract tourists.

“There is history for this,” Mr. Isenberg said. “Thomas Edison once called Curtis the brightest street in America, and historic photos show it lit up with theater marquees up and down. The vision is to bring back that vitality.”

With the Spire, three planned hotel projects and other developments, more than $1 billion in public and private investment is expected in the area in the next two years, he said.

The Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a report titled “Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2009,” listed Denver among 15 American cities expected to outperform the rest of the country. The report cites a good balance in housing supply and demand, a strong federal and state government presence to support jobs, continued population growth and a widely diverse economy.

This has not always been the case here. “A lot has changed in the past 25 years,” said Tom Clark, the executive vice president of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, an affiliate of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Clark was an original player in the Greater Denver Corporation, which was formed to chart a course after the oil-shale boom fizzled in the early 1980s, leaving Colorado’s oil and gas industry in a sinkhole.

A string of critical events took place, he said, after local leaders determined that the Rocky Mountain region had the potential to replace the industrial Midwest as the country’s economic heartland.

By the early 1990s, Stapleton, Denver’s “pocket” airport, hemmed in by urban development, had been dismantled, and the much larger Denver International had opened. The Stapleton site now consists of single- and multifamily housing, shopping areas, schools and office developments.

A similar transformation has occurred in Lower Downtown, a former warehouse district, where major league sports venues, restaurants, stores and hotels have sprung up.

These efforts have been augmented by the region’s light-rail system, which has demonstrated that new commercial development will follow the building of transit stations, said Cal Marsella, the general manager of the Regional Transportation District.

After the 1980s recession, the region had a talent pool of unemployed oil and gas engineers. That helped to attract aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin and eventually the Ball Corporation. Technology companies were later persuaded to relocate here during the dot-com boom, and when that ended, entrepreneurs pushed into biotechnology and finally alternative energy.

Colorado’s governor, Bill Ritter Jr., has pushed for investments in renewable energy to build on the presence of the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory at Golden, Colo., about 12 miles west of downtown Denver. A broader research initiative through the newly created Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, which combines statewide university researchers with those at the national laboratory, has helped create a reputation for Colorado as “a new world leader” in solar, wind and biofuel research, said the Collaboratory’s executive director, David Hiller.

Such efforts have already attracted a Danish wind-turbine manufacturer, Vestas. It is building turbine blades at a plant in Windsor, Colo., 58 miles north of Denver, and has plans for two more plants that will employ hundreds.

While new capital for commercial real estate projects remains tight — no new office project is likely to find financing until it is 85 percent leased, Mr. Clark said — a number of major projects in the Denver area are already under way with full financing.

Eric L. Nesbitt, a commercial real estate broker and president of the Denver Metro Commercial Association of Realtors, said commercial real estate continued to sell, “though it takes a lot longer to do a deal, and it takes more attention to detail.”

Like many others, Mr. Nesbitt said Denver would not be immune to economic challenges. “We’re going to suffer like the rest of the country in the coming year, without a doubt,” he said. “But hopefully we just won’t suffer quite as long or quite as hard.”
172 2009-01-07 WASHINGTON  Policy makers at the Federal Reserve appeared almost stunned by an economy that was sinking faster than they had expected on almost every front in December, so much so that they even toyed with the idea of not announcing an official target for overnight interest rates, according to minutes of the meeting released on Tuesday.

At the meeting on Dec. 15 and 16, Fed policy makers jumped through the looking glass and slashed the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks virtually to zero. Vowing to use “all available tools” for stimulating the economy, the Fed then outlined a radical new approach of pumping money into the economy through its own lending programs and through heavy purchases of mortgage-backed securities and possibly longer-term Treasury bonds.

Despite having already created a raft of new lending programs to financial institutions and even corporate borrowers, Fed policy makers as well as the Fed’s staff forecasters began the meeting with sharply reduced forecasts. They all expected a severe economic contraction that was likely to last through at least the first half of 2009.

“All meeting participants agreed that the economic downturn had intensified over all,” according to the minutes. The housing market was still weakening, credit conditions were tighter than ever, consumer spending had fallen for five months in a row. Even exports, which had been the one bright spot, were being hurt by a global economic slowdown.

“Many participants noted that the decline in household wealth resulting from large drops in equity and house prices, together with tighter credit conditions, rapidly increasing unemployment and deteriorating consumer sentiment, was contributing to a sharp contraction in consumer spending,” according to the meeting minutes.

Fed officials had scheduled a second day for the meeting to hash out their approach to policy once they reduced the federal funds rate to zero.

All of the policy makers agreed that they had to use “other tools” to stimulate the economy. But there was considerable debate about which tools would be most effective, and about how the Fed should communicate to the public about what it was doing.

In one of the most startling discussions, some policy makers argued that the central bank should simply drop its official target for the federal funds rate altogether. They noted that bank lending had become so paralyzed that the actual Fed funds rate was already well below the official target of 1 percent for the last month. Some advocates of not setting a Fed funds rate argued that it might actually help focus investor attention on the Fed’s new arsenal of policy measures.

Other policy makers feared that such a change would lead to confusion, and might prompt investors to think the Fed had lost control over short-term interest rates. In the end, the central bank lowered the target rate from 1 percent to a range from zero to one-quarter of a percent.

The minutes also conveyed a striking shift in worries about inflation. The minutes showed no hint that any of the Fed policy makers were worried that their actions might rekindle inflation. The only concerns about price levels were in connection with deflation, or an across-the-board decline in consumer prices.

Not only did policy makers agree that inflation would continue to fall, according to the minutes, but “some members saw significant risks that inflation could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels.” Officials also debated how they should communicate their actions once they stopped moving the Fed funds rate. Some wanted the Fed to announce quantitative targets for the amount of additional bank reserves they wanted to create, saying it might help ward off deflationary pressures.

The notes hinted at a possible power struggle between presidents of the Federal Reserve district banks, who serve on the Federal Open Market Committee that sets monetary policy, and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, which consists of the Fed chairman and up to six Fed governors. The open market committee sets interest rates, but the Fed governors in Washington have the power on their own to enact new lending programs, bail out financial institutions or buy up particular kinds of securities.

“A few” of those who supported quantitative targets, according to the minutes, argued that it would help “coordinate” actions between Fed governors in Washington and the Federal Open Market Committee, which included regional Fed presidents. In the end, policy makers decided against setting any quantitative targets and to continue “close consultation between the committee and the board.”

Policy makers acknowledged that a Fed funds rate of zero could cause headaches in certain parts of the financials markets, like money-market mutual funds, which might have difficulty earning fees to cover their operating costs. But “most participants” agreed that the benefits of a lower rate outweighed the headaches.
173 2009-01-07 And with the copying restrictions removed, people will be able to freely shift the songs they buy on iTunes among computers, phones and other digital devices.

Technologically sophisticated fans of digital music complain that D.R.M. imposes unfair restrictions on what they can do with the tracks they have bought. For example, the protected files from iTunes do not work on portable players made by companies other than Apple.

“I think the writing was on the wall, both for Apple and the labels, that basically consumers were not going to put up with D.R.M. anymore,” said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market research company.

Music industry watchers widely applauded the move and said it could help digital music sales, which have shown signs of slowing down just five years after Apple introduced iTunes.

In particular, lower prices for some songs could spur consumers “to buy deeper into the catalog, and expand their relationship with digital music,” said Russ Crupnick, an analyst with the NPD Group.

The music industry could use a lift. Sales of CDs fell 20 percent last year from 2007. About 2.4 billion songs were bought on iTunes in the last year, aided by Apple’s expansion into international markets. But that was not nearly enough to make up for losses in traditional retail stores.

Industry pundits have long pointed to D.R.M. as one culprit for the music companies’ woes, saying it alienated some customers while doing little to slow piracy on file-sharing networks.

Apple has been campaigning against D.R.M. at least since February 2007, when the chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, wrote an open letter criticizing the software. Apple reached a deal with EMI that year to offer music without the copying restrictions.

But it could never reach the same agreement with EMI’s larger rivals. Sony, Warner and Universal allowed other online music services, like Amazon’s MP3 Store, to sell unprotected music, but they withheld it from Apple. Their goal, industry analysts say, was to try to strengthen online rivals to iTunes, which they viewed as having a dangerous level of control over their business.

“Apple definitely wanted to remove D.R.M. from music, but the record labels would not allow them to renegotiate their licensing agreements, because they wanted to help competitors succeed against Apple in the market,” said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies, a consulting firm.

Apple, for its part, appeared to resist variable pricing, fearing it would amount to a price increase for the most popular tracks on iTunes, which constitute the bulk of sales on the service. It has also said the consistent 99-cent price made things simpler for buyers.

It is not clear what broke the impasse, but the deteriorating economy may have put pressure on music companies.

“For the major labels, it was clearly time for them to accelerate becoming digital music companies in a macroeconomic environment that is downright frightening,” said Greg Scholl, chief executive of The Orchard, a digital distributor of music from independent labels.

The compromise gives the recording industry new leverage over their online music sales, Mr. Scholl added. They can start to sell new tracks at the higher price, then gradually drop prices to keep sales moving. Labels could also experiment with bundled packages of songs and even special editions at higher prices.

Harry Wang, director of mobile product research at the consulting company Parks Associates, said, “They aren’t going to get a huge amount of money from this new arrangement, but in an ailing music industry, anything that can provide more money will be better than the status quo.”

Apple said customers would be able to pay a one-time fee to strip copying restrictions from music they have already bought on iTunes, at 30 cents a song or 30 percent of the album price. ITunes customers can achieve the same effect by burning all of their music to a CD and then reimporting the music into the iTunes software, although this reduces sound quality somewhat.

The company also said that its popular iPhone would be able to download songs from iTunes over wireless data networks like AT&T’s. Previously, iPhone owners had to either attach the phone to a computer or connect to a local Wi-Fi network.

Apple reported the changes in iTunes at its keynote presentation at the annual Macworld conference in San Francisco, given by Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide marketing.

Mr. Jobs was not at the event, after disclosing this week that he had a treatable hormone problem that had resulted in significant weight loss over the last year.
174 2009-01-07 The new trial request may represent Mr. Skilling’s best remaining hope to avoid spending most or all of the rest of his life in prison. The ruling on sentencing held that one of the less important factors listed by the judge as justifying a longer sentence — that his conduct had led to the collapse of a financial institution — was not applicable. The guidelines list pension funds as financial institutions, but the court ruled the Enron retirement plans did not qualify as pension plans.

Even with that change, the guidelines would still allow a very long sentence, and in any case the judge could decide to exceed the recommended sentence if he wished to do so, although he would have to explain why he thought that was appropriate.

The new trial possibility stems from the failure of prosecutors to tell Mr. Skilling of a statement made to government investigators by Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron chief financial officer who testified against Mr. Skilling. In that interview, Mr. Fastow said, according to F.B.I. interview notes, that he “doesn’t think [he] discussed list w/JS.” The F.B.I. report, known as a Form 302, that the government provided to the defense did not mention that statement. And when the judge asked to see all the interview notes to decide whether any of them needed to be disclosed to Mr. Skilling, that page was left out.

It is not clear what list Mr. Fastow was discussing. He testified that he discussed a list of talking points on one Enron deal with Mr. Skilling, and Mr. Skilling says that was the list being referred to. But the government said Mr. Fastow was discussing a different Enron transaction that was not part of the case against Mr. Skilling.

“We find the omission of this statement from the 302s troubling,” wrote Judge Prado in a unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel.

But the appeals court concluded it could not consider that issue because Judge Lake never saw the interview notes and thus never decided whether they needed to be disclosed to the defense. “Thus, there is nothing for us to review,” the appeals court judges concluded. “Skilling must bring this claim to the district court before we can address it.”

To get a new trial, Mr. Skilling would have to convince the trial judge that the failure to disclose that page for the judge’s review was prosecutorial misconduct.

In saying that Mr. Skilling was entitled to a “presumption of prejudice,” the judges focused on local news coverage before the trial and said Judge Lake’s conclusion that the articles were largely factual was not sufficient to dismiss the request for a change of venue.
175 2009-01-07 Stock markets pushed higher on Tuesday as investors shrugged off economic reports showing more troubles for America’s factories and service sector. Worries from the Federal Reserve that the recession could persist despite their best efforts did not hold back gains, either.

Technology, transportation and basic-materials sectors led the major indexes higher as Wall Street recouped its losses from Monday.

By the end of the day, the Dow gained 62.21 points, or 0.69 percent, to close at 9,015.10. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished 7.25 points, or 0.78 percent, higher to 934.70, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.5 percent, to 1,652.38.

The computer maker Hewlett-Packard gained 8 percent to close at $39.31 a share. Dell, Sun Microsystems and Intel all posted gains.

Shares of Apple fell back 1.65 percent to close at $93.02 a share, as the computer maker announced a new price structure for downloading iTunes. Apple shares had risen on Monday after its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, addressed swirling concerns about his health.
176 2009-01-07 Recently the beer panel tasted 25 oak-aged beers. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests: Richard Scholz, an owner of Bierkraft in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and Matt Stinton, the bar manager at Hearth in the East Village, which serves several different barrel-aged beers.

We all agreed that the tasting was fascinating, with many highly refined beers and few that indulged in extravagance for the sake of extravagance. Most striking was the number of styles on display in the tasting.

Some of the beers were dry and some were sweet. Some were black as stout and full of toasty malt flavors. Others were almost golden, with complex fruit flavors. In very few of the beers were the flavors of hops evident; the barrel aging seems to suppress their character.

In some beers, brewers had clearly encouraged the effects of different yeasts in the barrel, which, in the style of the lambic beers, produce intense sour flavors that people love or hate. Personally, I find them fascinating. In others, the barrels were used primarily to expose the beers to minuscule amounts of oxygen, which when done carefully can add attractive toffee or sherry-like characters to the beer. In still other cases, brewers used barrels that had once contained something else, like bourbon, Scotch, Port or even pinot noir, hoping to impart to the beer trace elements of the past contents.

The Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien, which was our No. 1 beer, was in fact aged in barrels that had previously been used for rum, grappa, Burgundy, cabernet sauvignon and other wines. None of these flavors were evident in the beer, or perhaps they were so well integrated that they could not be detected. In fact, in only one of the 25 beers was the taste of oak obvious, as in a bad vanilla-scented chardonnay: we rejected this bottle.

Clearly, though, oaky flavors are occasionally the aim. A couple of beers in our tasting were aged with oak chips rather than in barrels, a practice I generally abhor in wine. One of these, the Yeti Imperial Stout from Great Divide, even made our top 10. We thought it was complex and creamy, though with less finesse than the higher-ranked beers.

Most of these barrel-aged brews are potent, with 14 of the 25 brews at 10 percent alcohol or more. Yet the ones we liked best were not in any way overbearing or unbalanced. Our No. 2 brew, the Pozharnik Espresso Russian Imperial Stout from Pennichuck in New Hampshire, weighed in at a not exactly svelte 10 percent. While it was rich and full bodied, it was nonetheless balanced and smooth, with flavors of coffee and toffee.

Sounding lighter notes were our No. 3 and No. 4 beers, the Petrus Aged Pale from Bavik in Belgium, a tart, refreshing golden ale at 7.3 percent, and La Roja Amber Ale from Jolly Pumpkin in Michigan, rich, robust and spicy but only 7.2 percent. The Bavik was also our best value, relatively speaking, at $3.50 for an 11.2-ounce bottle.

So, why are these beers so expensive? Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery, cites the high cost of labor and storage for these beers, which are made by hand in small lots. What’s more, barrels themselves can be very expensive. Brooklyn has just issued its own barrel-aged beer, Black Ops, which was not available in time for our tasting. It costs around $20 for a 25.4-ounce bottle.

Obviously, these are not beers for chugging. They are specialized brews that can go beautifully with food. The tangy lambic-style beers would go well with seafood or cheeses. The richer imperial stout-style brews could be just the thing with chocolate. As for the cost, well, think of them as you would of a bottle of wine for sharing. You wouldn’t mind paying $35 for a bottle of wine, would you? Don’t answer that.

206 2009-01-08 NEW DELHI  Ramalinga Raju was contrite, sort of.

In an emotionally charged four-and-a-half page letter, Mr. Raju, the chairman and co-founder of one of India’s largest outsourcing companies, described to his board on Wednesday how a small discrepancy had mushroomed into one of the biggest scandals in Indian corporate history.

“What started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years. It has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of company operations grew,” he wrote. “It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.”

In the end, the scandal threatened to gobble up not just Mr. Raju, who resigned, but his company, Satyam Computer Services. Far beyond Satyam, it raised fears that similar problems might lurk in other Indian companies, particularly in its vaunted outsourcing industry.

“One only hopes that with the kind of scrutiny and the kind of focus this brings, everybody doesn’t end up being painted with the same brush,” said Lakshminarayana, the chief strategy officer for Wipro Technologies, which competes with Satyam.

The long-running fraud, which is being called India’s Enron, also raised questions about the vigilance of regulators in India and the United States.

Satyam serves as the back office for one-third of the Fortune 500, including some of the largest banks, manufacturers, health care and media companies in the world  handling things like computer systems and customer service for companies that include General Electric, Nestlé, Ford Motor, Cisco and the United States government.

In some cases, Satyam even acted as clients’ outsourced finance and accounting departments.

The fraud will make “people even more nervous about investing” in India and other developing markets, said Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lead manager with Somerset Capital Management, a fund that specializes in emerging markets.

India needs foreign investment more than ever. Though it has enjoyed 9 percent growth a year recently, that is expected to slow to 7 percent, at best, as the global economy cools. Housing prices are down, the country’s major stock index, the Sensex, is half what it was a year ago. And India’s government has little financial leeway for giant stimulus packages like those in China and the United States.

Outsourcing and information technology are crucial parts of the Indian economy. They provided local companies with $64 billion in revenues in 2008 and employed more than two million people directly, and millions more indirectly.

Mr. Raju said he had regularly falsified Satyam’s accounts as the company expanded from a small family-run firm into a back office giant with 53,000 workers in 66 countries.

Some of India’s biggest conglomerates started out as family-run companies, and analysts fear the taint of corruption from Satyam  poor governance, lax accounting controls and a lack of transparency  could sully any of those big companies for investors and customers.

Relatives often hold crucial management positions and sizable stakes in the companies. Foreign investors have begun to push for more outside representation on boards, and for families to give up controlling stakes they hold.

A huge piece of Satyam’s finances was a fantasy. Of the 53.6 billion rupees in cash and bank balances the company listed as assets at the end of its second quarter, 50.4 billion rupees ($1 billion), were nonexistent, according to Mr. Raju’s letter. Revenues for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were actually 20 percent lower than the 27 billion rupees reported, and the company’s profit for the quarter was just 10 percent of what it reported at the time.

Many analysts said it was unthinkable that Mr. Raju had acted without accomplices, and regulators in India, Europe and the United States were likely to take action against Satyam for false accounting. In addition to being listed in India, its shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange since May 2001, and on Euronext since January 2008.

Satyam’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has audited the company since its NYSE listing, said it was “examining” Mr. Raju’s statement and could not comment further.

Many Satyam clients said they were studying the situation. Cisco said it did not expect any “material impact.”

The revelations could lead to a major shake-up in India’s outsourcing industry, as a nearly cashless Satyam struggles to meet payroll and other expenses. Satyam may be shut down, sold off in its entirety or broken into pieces, they say.

John C. McCarthy, an analyst with Forrester Research in New York, said Satyam’s clients were scrambling to find out “whether the fraud is intermingled” with their operations, and what their liabilities are.

“This happens like clockwork in the high-tech business,” he said. “Every three to four years there’s some financial scandal. It is because high-tech has traditionally been viewed by the financial analysts as a growth industry. There are huge pressures to maintain that growth, and not all companies have the management wherewithal to survive under those pressures.” In the short term, many Satyam clients will migrate to competition like Infosys and TCS, said analysts with Religare Hichens Harrison.

News of the scandal sent the Sensex index down 7 percent on Wednesday. Shares in Satyam fell about 78 percent. Trading in Satyam on the NYSE was suspended until further notice.

Though Mr. Raju’s announcement shocked most of the world, there had been signs for months that something was wrong at the top of Satyam.

The company came under close scrutiny after an October report on Fox News that it had been banned from World Bank contracts when spy software was installed on some computers. Satyam denied the accusation, but in December the World Bank confirmed it had been banned for giving improper benefits to bank staff, and for not accounting for all its fees.

In December, Satyam investors revolted after the company proposed buying two firms with ties to Mr. Raju’s sons.

On Dec. 30, analysts with Forrester Research warned that corporations that relied on Satyam might ultimately need to stop doing business with the company.

“Firms should take the initial steps of reviewing the exit clauses in their current Satyam contracts,” in case management or direction of the company changes, Forrester said.

Four of the company’s directors resigned recently and the company hired Merrill Lynch for strategic advice, a move that is generally a precursor to a sale.

On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch sent a letter to India’s stock exchanges, saying it had terminated its relationship with Satyam after the bank “came to understand that there were material accounting irregularities” at the company. Merrill Lynch officials declined to comment further.

Mr. Raju wrote in his confessional letter that neither he nor the managing director (his brother B. Rama Raju) had “taken one rupee/dollar from the company.” He said the board, his brother and their families had no knowledge of the situation, seeming to leave open the possibility that someone else did.

SEBI, India’s securities regulator, said it would investigate trading in Satyam’s shares. Mr. Raju could face up to 10 years in jail and fines of $5 million in India for the accounting fraud.
207 2009-01-08 After five days, a 21-month-old girl who disappeared during a New Year’s party was found alive by the police Tuesday in an abandoned well. The girl, Ana Clara Abranches, had disappeared from a ranch in the state of Rondonia. Her face was full of insect bites and she had lost more than six pounds. Doctors at the hospital where the child is recovering said she had survived by eating mud and drinking rainwater.
208 2009-01-08 Tens of thousands of people gathered in a sports stadium in the capital, Phnom Penh, for the 30th anniversary of the ouster of the Khmer Rouge regime. It was responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people between 1975 and Jan. 7, 1979, when it was driven from power. The movement’s leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998. Five other leading figures have been arrested and are awaiting trial in a mixed Cambodian-United Nations tribunal. The first of the trials is expected to begin this year. The defendant is Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, the commandant of the Tuol Sleng Prison, where at least 14,000 people were tortured and sent to the killing fields.
209 2009-01-08 Jeff Orleans, the executive director of the Ivy League, said that Ivy programs filling vacant slots had a different set of considerations than those facing schools in major conferences. With more time and less pressure to be immediately competitive, they can afford to cast a wider net. Yale’s athletic director, Tom Beckett, took more than five weeks to hire Williams.

“If what you want to do is coach at the highest level of your sport, we may not be the first place you look,” Orleans said. “But I think we look to a larger pool, not necessarily racially but in terms of a variety of backgrounds.”

He added, “In a lot of other conferences, the pressure to not lose ground, not lose a minute, to be 10-2 again this season really narrows that pool.”

Williams, 38, had been a defensive coach with the Jacksonville Jaguars for two seasons after bouncing around the college game for 11 years as an assistant. As a player, he was a four-year starter and captain at Stanford before a stint on the practice squad of the San Francisco 49ers.

“Tom Williams is a leader,” Beckett said at a news conference. “The fact that he is African-American is spectacular. But it didn’t matter.”

Williams’s hiring is particularly significant in light of both the election of Obama as the nation’s first black president and in the consistently meager numbers of black head coaches at the top level of college football.

Last November, a report by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida underlined the issue, noting that there were only four black head coaches in the 119-member Football Bowl Subdivision (the Ivy League is one level below in the Football Championship Subdivision). The report added that since 1996, 12 black coaches had been hired among 199 vacancies.

But that trend has changed lately, with four more black coaches being hired at the top level over the last month, the latest being DeWayne Walker at New Mexico State.

Still, 8 of 119 is a low percentage. College football also came in for criticism recently when Tennessee and Auburn hired white coaches coming off disastrous seasons — Lane Kiffin with the Oakland Raiders and Gene Chizik at Iowa State — while passing over Turner Gill, a successful black coach who turned Buffalo into the Mid-American Conference champion.

The numbers at the top level of college basketball are more robust, with nearly 30 percent of the head-coaching jobs currently filled by African-Americans.

As for Williams, the racial implications of his hiring seemed far from his mind when he stepped behind the lectern Wednesday. He was concerned with his timing and, of course, Yale’s big rival, Harvard.

Williams is taking over from Jack Siedlecki, who retired in November after 12 seasons to become an assistant athletic director at Yale. Siedlecki led the Bulldogs to a share of the Ivy League title in 1999 and 2006, but had also lost seven of the past eight contests with Harvard. With a very brief list of goals — there are only two — Williams vowed to right the ship. The first thing, he said, is to win back the Ivy crown.

“And secondly, we’re going to beat Harvard,” he said, drawing a round of applause from the alumni in the room. “We’ve got to turn The Game back into a rivalry. It’s been a little one-sided.”
210 2009-01-08 WASHINGTON — Federal agencies in charge of radiation protection are struggling to revise their standards to take into account the differences in susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer among men, women and children, and, according to a report released Wednesday, are lagging in that task.

The report, from the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, said the rules were still too heavily based on “Reference Man,” a standard created by the International Commission on Radiological Protection in 1975. That standard is a 5-foot-7, 154-pound man who is “Western European or North American in habitat and custom.”

But the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said they now considered the average sensitivity of different groups to radiation, although the agencies were still trying to translate radiation into dose levels. In separate interviews, scientists at each agency said the difference in cancer susceptibility was one of several uncertainties, including precisely how many cancers a dose of radiation would produce.

In May, Senator Barack Obama and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, now the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, raised concerns about the standards in a letter to the environmental agency.

Experts agree that women face a risk about 50 percent higher than the Reference Man from the same amount of radioactive material, while the risk for children is several-fold higher.

“Using a white Caucasian male model is too narrow a brush for the world we live in,” said Arjun Makhijani, the author of the report and the president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a nonprofit group in Takoma Park, Md., that has found errors in government regulation of nuclear matters.
211 2009-01-08 “They’re keeping their heads down,” he said, because of relentless surveillance and frequent prosecutions. While describing this as very encouraging, he also cautioned that “the networks have not gone away.” MI5 intelligence indicated that militants still intended to attack Britain and that such an attack could occur at any time, despite the agency’s vigilance.

“There could easily be activities we’re not aware of,” he said. “We don’t have anything approaching comprehensive coverage.”

Mr. Evans said that 75 percent of MI5’s investigations involved connections with Pakistan, the ancestral homeland of about three-quarters of Britain’s estimated population of 1.5 million to 2.5 million Muslims. The main threat to Britain, he said, came from Al Qaeda’s core in Pakistan and its “assets in this country.”

Mr. Evans, 50, who took over in 2007, made it clear that he had little taste for the exposure customary for the leaders of American intelligence agencies, with testimony before Congress and other public appearances. Reporters were not allowed to name the floor of the Millbank building where he has his office, and photographers were not invited. MI5 distributed its own photograph of Mr. Evans, showing him as a balding, genial-looking figure in an open-necked shirt.

Statistics he offered reflected changes in an agency known for years as a bastion of white male dominance, with many recruits drawn from Oxford and Cambridge. In the 1950s, the agency had about 850 employees. With an urgent recruitment drive after the attacks against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, it now has more than 3,000.

More than half of MI5’s officers are now women, Mr. Evans said, and 8 percent are from ethnic minorities. “My staff are on the streets every day trying to keep the nation safe,” he said. But they are dealing with an adaptive enemy that has learned lessons from the increased surveillance.

He said Qaeda suspects in Britain rarely spoke to one another in or near buildings and made increased use of Internet-based telephone services, which are harder to monitor than conventional phone lines.

While the need to set priorities for investigations means there is always the chance of an attack by extremists who have escaped the agency’s surveillance, he said, “I think it’s quite likely that the next attack, or next attempted attack, will involve people of whom we have heard or about whom we know a bit.”
212 2009-01-08 Mr. Obama also said last week that Mr. Burris should not be seated. But Senate officials said Wednesday that Mr. Obama had changed course this week, urging Mr. Reid in a private meeting on Monday to find an “amicable resolution.”

Mr. Obama voiced support for Mr. Burris on Wednesday. “If he gets seated, then I’m going to work with Roland Burris, just like I work with all the other senators, to make sure that the people of Illinois and the people of the country are served,” he said.

Mr. Reid said he hoped the Senate would soon be able to consider Mr. Burris’s appointment if Mr. Burris is able to get the Illinois secretary of state to sign his credentials and convince a state legislative panel considering impeaching the governor that he offered nothing in exchange for his selection.

Under the developing situation, Mr. Burris’s appointment will still need to be reviewed by the Rules Committee if he gets the needed countersignature. If the Senate panel were to recommend he be seated, the full Senate would vote, leading Democrats to warn that Republicans could potentially be a roadblock. But one senior Republican official said Wednesday that he doubted any Republican would try to tie up the appointment, not wanting to entangle the party in what has been a Democrat dilemma

“I think the unanimous Republican view is that this is a mess, an ethically tainted, challenged mess,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Mr. McConnell, the Republican leader, and his fellow Senate Republicans would prefer the new Illinois senator be chosen in a special election, which would provide them a chance to win the seat. But they have little leverage to force such an election.

The episode was proving to be a serious distraction for Democrats and something of an embarrassment to the leadership after top Democrats had taken such a strong stance against the appointment initially.

After Mr. Blagojevich was arrested and the continuing inquiry made public, Senate Democrats urged him not to make an appointment. When Mr. Burris was tapped, the leadership came out strongly against his selection, hoping to force Mr. Blagojevich to back down. They also discounted the potential racial element of the showdown, particularly since Mr. Obama, who is about to become the first black president, was siding with them.

But Democrats immediately came under fire for barring a black appointee. And while senators hoped to keep the focus on Governor Blagojevich, the ensuing furor increasingly became about Mr. Burris, who has a long record of public involvement in Illinois and no discernible link to the investigation.

At the same time, some Democrats were uncomfortable with continuing to resist Mr. Burris, and on Tuesday Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat and departing chairwoman of the Rules Committee, called for him to be seated.

By Wednesday morning, the momentum was on Mr. Burris’s side, particularly since he said he had been able to assure the public that he was in the clear as far as offering Mr. Blagojevich anything for a chance to serve in the Senate.

“There was certainly no pay-to-play involved because I don’t have no money,” Mr. Burris quipped.

Despite suggestions that Democrats would prefer that Mr. Burris serve only the two years remaining in the term and not seek election on his own, he said no commitment had been made. But he was not ready to say if he would run in 2010.

“Let me get my Senate legs under me and get in and raise some money to pay for all this stuff we’ve been doing, and figure out that once we get in and get settled and learn where the bathrooms are,” Mr. Burris said.
213 2009-01-08 By contrast, IndyMac’s buyers will bear the first 20 percent of any future write-downs on about $13 billion of the loans. Beyond that, though, the lion’s share of losses will be borne by the F.D.I.C. But the agency will share only in the profits associated with a $2 billion collection of loans.

The F.D.I.C. is also leaving in place a $6 billion loan to IndyMac that could be hard to refinance. Throw in IndyMac’s deposit liabilities of more than $6 billion, and that leaves only $1.6 billion of the $13.9 billion of assets for the buyers to fund with new cash. On top of that, the buying group has applied for a federal holding company charter for its acquisition vehicle. That could eventually bring the buyers tax benefits too.

The F.D.I.C. says the deal allows it to rid itself of hard-to-sell assets, including IndyMac’s portfolio of troublesome Alt-A mortgages. The agency had already sunk about $9 billion from its insurance fund into IndyMac, so while it did shop the bank to a range of possible buyers, it may have understandably been in a hurry to return it to private hands. Perhaps that justifies some of F.D.I.C.’s concessions. But assuming no one steps in with a better offer this time, the agency should aim to strike a harder bargain next time.

It used to be that if you wanted a job done properly, you did it yourself. That no longer holds for the administration of hedge funds. The practice of doing administrative work in-house was already on the wane. But Bernard L. Madoff’s apparent fraud appears to be accelerating the march toward outsourcing.

Exhibit A this week is Millennium Management, the old-school hedge fund firm run by Izzy Englander. All its funds are now going to be administered by GlobeOp Financial Services. That means tasks like reconciling cash positions will now be handled outside.

Millennium’s move does not suggest anything is amiss. But it does reflect a hardening investor mood expressed most decisively, if belatedly, by Union Bancaire Privée, the Swiss bank. After big losses on investments managed by Mr. Madoff, UBP said it would no longer invest in funds that didn’t outsource administration.

The idea is that an independent administrator, earning only service fees and not reliant on any one fund, has no incentive to let anything slip by. Funds that outsource trading and custody-related functions should give investors even more comfort, because that gives administrators different sources of data to cross-reference.

By contrast, Mr. Madoff’s investment outfit was buried within his market-making firm, so he appears to have acted as his own administrator, prime broker and custodian. That may have allowed him to fabricate consistent-looking documentation to fool his investors.

With investors and regulators demanding more transparency, hedge fund managers may find it a blessing to hand paper-pushing tasks to someone else. Then they’ll have more time to do what they are supposed to do best: investing.
214 2009-01-08 For those who were thinking of going to City Hall on Jan. 20 to watch a live broadcast of President-elect Barack Obama’s inauguration, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, has an urgent message: Sorry, you’re too late.

More than 2,000 New Yorkers have already registered to watch the inauguration on several large-screen televisions in City Hall, Ms. Quinn said on Wednesday. As a result, there is simply no more room — not in the Council’s Chambers, not in its Committee Room, not in the Red Room, not even in the Rotunda.

“I’m sorry that it got so full so quickly, though I think that’s an incredibly exciting thing that so many people want to come to City Hall, want to be in their local seat of government, to watch this incredibly exciting event,” said Ms. Quinn, a Democrat who, like almost 80 percent of city voters on Nov. 4, backed Mr. Obama.

Ms. Quinn had announced the public screening on Dec. 22 as a way of offering residents who could not travel to Washington (much less find a place to stay) a way to mark the occasion publicly. But city officials got so many responses that they had to halt the registration process much earlier than the original Jan. 16 deadline.

Those who cannot get in will be given information soon, Ms. Quinn said, as to other locations where screenings are planned. So far, these include York College in Jamaica, hosted by Councilman Thomas White Jr. of Queens; Trinity Church on Wall Street; and the Queens Theater in the Park in Flushing.

Details for the City Hall screenings are still being ironed out. But doors will open at 10:30 a.m. for the noon inauguration. And no, you can’t bring Champagne — food and drinks are prohibited.
215 2009-01-08 On Wednesday, at a meeting of the country’s security cabinet, he helped persuade his fellow ministers to hold off on expanding the ground war to give diplomats a chance to stop Hamas from rearming through its smuggling routes under the Egyptian Sinai. The focus of the discussions, involving Egypt, France, Britain and the United States, is on using an international force of experts and troops at the southern Gaza border.

“Barak is very cautious,” noted Isaac Herzog, Israel’s minister of social welfare and a fellow Labor Party member who was at the meeting. “He is a cool-headed manager of this campaign but wants to exhaust diplomatic avenues.”

Voters seem aware of the risk to their soldiers of deepening the Gaza invasion, so the relative pause should not be politically problematic. But the truth is that the public wanted this war more than Mr. Barak did. With elections coming, he felt it would be difficult to hold off any longer, especially when Hamas increased its rocket fire to some 60 rockets a day, several who know him believe.

Furious and frightened after thousands of projectiles had rained down on the south over several years, Israelis yearned for a traditional Zionist warrior to rally around and send a harsh message to Hamas. For months, Mr. Barak, the natural candidate for that warrior role, declined.

At 66, Mr. Barak is the country’s most decorated soldier, famous for having foiled an airplane hijacking years ago while disguised in a mechanic’s uniform and for leading a revenge killing operation against Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon while dressed as a woman. A skilled pianist famed for a steel-trap mind, he has also been the military chief of staff.

But he never took Hamas as seriously as many others, considering it a relatively small strategic challenge whose rockets and arms buildup could be tolerated for a while to allow bigger problems to be handled.

“His eyes are focused on Iran,” noted Gilead Sher, who was his chief of staff when he was prime minister a decade ago. “Hamas and Hezbollah largely worry him in relation to Iran.”

This, too, is an irony of Mr. Barak’s renewed popularity from the war, because his failure to grasp how average Israelis viewed the rockets is part of a larger political failure on his part. He lacks the kind of easy direct contact with the public that makes for a successful political leader.

In fact, only days before beginning the war, Mr. Barak was berated at an internal Labor Party meeting over his lack of response to the rockets.

“Members were asking aloud what had happened to him, whether he had lost it,” a party member who was present recalled. “One member, a minister, said, ‘I’m embarrassed to walk in the street and hear people talk about you as a big nothing. I get text messages from my cousins in the south asking what’s going on. Why aren’t we attacking?’ ”

Mr. Barak, the party member said, flew into a rage, saying he had seen more blood than anyone in the room, that he had witnessed things so horrible they would faint just hearing of them, that he would not be lectured to on the need to be tough.

At that time, Labor was polling about 8 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, with the opposition Likud, headed by Benjamin Netanyahu, at 30 and the centrist Kadima, led by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, in the mid-20s. Today polls show Labor around 16 to 18; some are fantasizing about squeezing past Kadima for second place.

There is a long history in Israel of warriors becoming peacemakers, and Mr. Barak seemed to fit that pattern a decade ago. But he was always something of a hybrid, and returned to politics after a long hiatus in 2007, when he was elected the leader of the Labor Party. Now it remains to be seen whether he can again turn his comfort in the military arena into a platform for political success.

One reason he might not do so is his political tin ear. After he left politics at the start of this decade he went into business and got rich, buying an apartment on the 31st floor of Tel Aviv’s exclusive Akirov Towers. In recent months he tried to sell it for $11 million. For a leader of Israel’s social democratic party that seeks to speak for the working man, this was clearly a misstep.

In an interview with Ari Shavit, a writer for the newspaper Haaretz, about 10 days before the war began, Mr. Barak described the purchase as a mistake.

“I admit I did not take into account that an apartment like this would become a symbol,” he said.

But he argued that the contest for national leadership should not be a popularity contest.

“When a plane has to be landed in a storm, you don’t ask if there is someone nice here,” he said. “Nor do you ask whether there is someone who looks like a pilot or talks like a pilot or once stood next to a pilot during a flight. You ask if there is a real pilot here, not a nice guy, not a back-slapper.”

That sales pitch was adopted by the party, with advertisements showing an unsmiling Mr. Barak and the words “not friendly, not trendy and not nice.” It is seen as a surprisingly successful approach.

Most analysts say that whether the election victor is Likud or Kadima, Mr. Barak could well remain in his post as defense minister, where the public is comfortable seeing him. Mr. Netanyahu has told others that if he becomes prime minister he will seek to bring Labor in by keeping Mr. Barak as defense minister.

At the same time, some on Israel’s left seem to be looking again at Mr. Barak as the man to vote for precisely because he has shown caution in going to war.

“Many see Barak as the old Israel, the one that won the ’67 war brilliantly and overwhelmingly after hesitating for a month,” Mr. Shavit of Haaretz said. “This is his pattern. Don’t rush in. Try to avoid it. But if you start the war, win the war. It is exactly the opposite of Olmert of ’06, which was to rush in and lose it. If the war doesn’t turn into a disaster, there is feeling of relief that we are back to being the old Israelis in the sense of thinking a bit before we act.”
216 2009-01-08 The netbook PC category has not been around that long, but already Sony is slipping a new model between the traditional laptop computers and the trimmer netbooks.

The new Sony Vaio P series Lifestyle PC is lighter than most laptops at 1.4 pounds and is MacBook Air-thin at less than an inch. It is not quite 10 inches wide with a bright eight-inch LCD screen. Like a laptop, the P uses a 1.3-HHz Intel processor.

The extra inches give it a more comfortable keyboard than the typical paperback-size netbook. Sony says it will go four hours on a battery charge. It can be configured with either a hard drive or solid-state storage. With 3G mobile broadband, like a smartphone, and Wi-Fi, like a PC, it begins to blur the distinctions between devices.

But Sony also creates another kind of category with this device: the premium-priced netbook. Like other Sony Vaios, the design is sleek and it comes in many colors.

Sony is asking $900 for the most basic model, twice the price tag of many other netbooks. It goes on sale later this month. STEPHEN WILLIAMS
217 2009-01-08 Hamish Bowles, the Vogue editor who was curator of “ : The White House Years,” a 2001 show of Kennedy’s style at the , said of Mrs. Obama, “My perception is that she’s already had an extremely potent effect” on the business.

“Just looking at the designers she’s been drawn to, you can see she’s shown astute sartorial judgment,” Mr. Bowles said. What she has also made clear in her choices, he added, is “that thoughtful and intelligent American designers are perfectly capable of creating clothes that have an impact on the world stage.”

The key word in that statement is “American,” a fact not lost on the retailers burdened in recent years by the weakened purchasing power of the dollar in , where most designer fashion originates, and by the decision American consumers seem to have made to shop in their closets as they wait out the recession.

“There is something timely about celebrating American fashion and American designers,” said Stephanie Solomon, the fashion director of Bloomingdale’s, although that “something” may be largely a function of the $5,000 price tag on a typical imported dress from Lanvin.

“Mrs. Obama is, first of all, very elegant and has wonderful taste,” Ms. Solomon said. “But she also recognizes the value of beautiful dresses and not big prices. She dresses like taste doesn’t necessarily have to do with brand or status, but with what looks well on your body and makes you look glamorous, bottom line.” And that, she added, is “very refreshing and appropriate for this period.”

American fashion, said Steven Kolb, the executive director of the , like the American automobile and banking industries, is “at a crossroads” in dire need of some kind of boost. Reviving a faltering homegrown industry may seem like a lot to expect of one woman, however highly placed. Yet, whether or not she likes it — or has any particular interest in fashion at all — the first lady has traditionally been expected to use her position to help promote American goods.

“What the first lady wears has a lot of effect on the industry, absolutely,” said , who began designing clothes for the wives of American presidents during the term of . The first lady, Mr. Scaasi said, “is seen every day in some form of media, and what she looks like is copied by other women.”

Even Mamie Eisenhower managed to inspire followers with her goofy and pastel matron style. Although Mrs. Eisenhower probably never set off a frenzy, as happened after Mrs. Obama wore a $148 dress from the label White House Black Market on “The View,” she had an effect.

“Mamie wore bangs because she had a very high forehead,” Mr. Scaasi explained. “But then hairdressers everywhere told me that women were saying, ‘I want my hair just like Mamie’s.’ ” When was president, he said, “ made a statement by having gray hair, and suddenly gray-haired grandmothers were chic.”

When Mrs. Obama’s husband takes office, she will be roughly two decades younger than Mrs. Bush was on the day her husband was sworn in. Three days before the , Mrs. Obama will turn 45. Yet like her husband she conveys a more youthful impression, and her vital appearance has a lot do with her particular appeal to the fashion industry.

“She’s like 25 years younger than the last few first ladies, and her age opens her up to a more youthful approach,” the designer said. “I loved her choice of Narciso,” she added, referring to the designer Narciso Rodriguez, whose dress Mrs. Obama wore, in a version she adapted from the runway original and customized with a cardigan sweater, on election night. (That choice set off living room debates across the land over whether it flattered Mrs. Obama or not.)

“She could potentially do what Jackie Kennedy did, bring about a new awareness and a fresh outlook, just by not being so intentionally ‘first lady,’ by mixing designer things with off the rack,” Ms. Sui said. “She can give a big boost to the American fashion industry — and we need all the help we can get.”

If one thinks about it, said Thakoon Panichgul, a gifted industry favorite whose name entered the mainstream after Mrs. Obama wore one of his short-sleeved print dresses on the final night of the Democratic Convention, Mrs. Obama does not “dress so young, exactly, and yet it’s young because it feels fresh.”

He continued: “She’ll wear a sheath with flats and not pumps. That’s not, quote unquote, appropriate, and people perceive that first ladies should be appropriate. She has the chutzpah to put it out there regardless of what anybody says.”

If in Mr. Panichgul’s view it is Mrs. Obama’s casual yet savvy approach to fashion that makes her compelling to watch, for other observers there is something deeper in play.

“Actually, her taste is very conservative, kind of jock-preppy, a version of a safe American WASP way of dressing,” said Andrew Bolton, curator of the at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “But what is truly compelling about her is her body. She has this athletic, commanding and confident presence that is very American.” She may look great in a shift dress, he said, “but her body is so strong that I end up forgetting what she’s wearing much of the time.”

The potential effect Mrs. Obama’s physical and intellectual confidence can have on fashion, the designer , president of the council of fashion designers, said in an e-mail message from , is to promote “individuality” at a time when fashion is casting about for ways to replace the designer cultism it so recently enshrined. It does not seem insignificant, either, that Mrs. Obama expresses her pleasure in following fashion without worrying that to do so automatically compromises her seriousness.

“The way Michelle Obama dresses is not her to the fashion industry,” said Mr. Kolb of the designers’ council. “It’s how she is. I think about my sister who lives in and is a teacher, and about the women she works with, and how they can look at Michelle Obama and not have to pretend to be that woman, that working mother with kids who knows the big designer names but also shops at J. Crew and the . She’s who they are.”
218 2009-01-08 Doug Winbigler of Amish Originals Furniture Company, a retailer in Westerville, Ohio, has witnessed the Amish transition since he opened in 1992. “The change today is unbelievable,” said Mr. Winbigler, who is not Amish but buys his furniture from 75 Amish craftsmen in northern Ohio. “When we started, there was a hesitance because this was still a small industry and they wondered how we would treat them and represent them. They were concerned that they would be exploited. Today it has become more of a business and from a small-business angle, people are people. There are good and bad in every bunch.”

Many Amish have dealt with the collision of modern business technology and old world values by keeping their home and work lives completely separate. Though they still drive horses and buggies, remain off the power grid and wear simple, handmade clothing, some are using computers and power tools and talking on cellphones at their jobs.

Mr. Swaffer, of Keim, said that several Amish employees walk around the mill with Bluetooth cellphones in their ears, but the phones are owned by Keim and the workers shut them off when they leave work. “You won’t likely see someone on a horse and buggy talking on a cellphone,” he added.

Keim’s 120,000-square-foot showroom uses the latest computer technology and software. Given that the company’s general manager and most of its department managers are Amish, Keim had to go through a lengthy transition to get its workers to feel comfortable with the new technology.

“As a company, Keim didn’t want to violate the Amish principles,” Mr. Swaffer said. “Our owner, Bill Keim, shares the same principles, and there was a desire not to offend anyone. So it took a couple of years of education to get everybody on board.”

Kenny Troyer, who is Old Order Amish, straddles both worlds. He is the co-founder and a board member of Amish Naturals, a start-up in Holmesville, Ohio, that makes pasta, granola and sauces from Amish recipes. His co-founder, David Skinner Sr., is not Amish.

Mr. Troyer grew up on a farm without electricity, automobiles, telephones or television. His home is still without these modern conveniences but he is comfortable using a phone and computer at work. He does not drive but is willing to ride in a car. He acknowledges that some Amish churches grapple with collision of the old and the new and will not allow their members to use a phone or ride in a car, even at work. “Our community is a little more liberal,” Mr. Troyer said.

In a culture that puts a premium on families staying at home and working together on the farm, young Amish are increasingly leaving to take jobs outside the home. In a community for which time stood still in the 19th century, such changes are significant.

“For the Amish community in North America, the move from farming to small business is really a mini-industrial revolution,” said Donald B. Kraybill, a professor and senior fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. “This is the most important and consequential change they’ve experienced since they came to North America in the 18th century.”

Professor Kraybill, who co-wrote “Amish Enterprise: From Plow to Profits,” estimates that more than half of Amish households now earn their primary income from small business rather than farming and in some Amish settlements (there are more than 400 different settlements in North America), the percentage of households earning their income from nonfarming commerce is over 90 percent.

“It is a dramatic change,” Professor Kraybill said. “It impacts the family and exposes them to the concept of competition and the need to use technology to be able to compete effectively.”

Professor Kraybill said he did not have data on how Amish businesses were faring in this current economy. He said he had heard that some had laid off employees and cut back hours but he knew of no business that had closed in the last six months. “I doubt if many will,” he said, because “the church usually comes in and takes over failing businesses before they fail.”

Like other religions, the Amish have various degrees of orthodoxy. There are many different affiliations of Amish groups, from the heavily traditional Old Order to the more progressive Amish Mennonites. Each church district has its own rules about everything from dress to use of technology. Some continue to shun extensive contact with the modern world while others are more flexible and pragmatic about embracing new technologies. Generally, each Amish community has a bishop who can decide, with the community’s input, whether or not to accept changes.

Mr. Winbigler said he had learned in his 16 years in the Amish furniture business that doing business with the Amish is all about the relationships. Real friendships have formed, and Mr. Winbigler has been invited to Amish weddings, funerals and family gatherings. “We’ve seen the intimate side of the community and it has been wonderful. But as it becomes more of a business, you lose time for some of those special things.”

Inevitably, the shift toward business amounts to a tradeoff for the Amish. According to Professor Kraybill, the Amish are generally frugal, very astute businesspeople who can outbid non-Amish contractors because they are able to keep their costs low. Amish small-business owners do not pay Social Security taxes, for example, because of an exemption granted to them in 1965. The family cares for the elderly and the local church takes care of health care expenses. All this has enabled them to increase the wealth in their communities and sustain their preferred way of life.

But the Amish struggle with the impact on the family. “The family can’t work together the way they did on the farm,” Professor Kraybill said. “If there are three teenage sons, they may each be going off to a job somewhere else. The father may be going off to work as well.”

And the more they start to accept new forms of technology, the more difficult it becomes to control outside influences. “They were able to keep the mainstream industrial revolution at bay for a century and a half,” Professor Kraybill said. “Now they can’t help but be more exposed to the outside world.”
219 2009-01-08 SAN FRANCISCO — The global economic slump is hitting the computer industry faster and deeper than previously expected.

Intel, the world’s largest maker of chips for personal computers, said on Wednesday that its sales for the fourth quarter would fall short of previously reduced forecasts by about $500 million. In mid-November, the company, which is generally seen as a bellwether for the computer industry, lowered the range of its sales forecasts for the quarter by about $1.4 billion.

Intel’s failure to make good on forecasts it made less than two months ago underscores the speed and sharpness of the industry decline. It also illustrates the challenge that companies are facing as they try to gauge their prospects.

“The magnitude and pace of the decline across the tech sector is without precedent,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Collins Stewart. Mr. Kumar said the only comparable slump occurred in the wake of the dot-com collapse early this decade, but that decline had followed a period of unparalleled growth.

“The floor continues to get reset,” Mr. Kumar said.

In a preliminary financial report, Intel said that revenue for the quarter was about $8.2 billion, down 23 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. In mid-November, the company reduced its fourth-quarter revenue projections to $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion, from $10.1 billion to $10.9 billion.

253 2009-01-09 In a report scheduled to be released Friday, the Congressional panel overseeing the $700 billion federal bailout has expressed growing concern about the effectiveness and execution of the rescue plan.

A draft of the report obtained by The New York Times criticized the Treasury Department for its “shifting explanations” about the underlying purpose of the bailout, its failure to answer many of the panel’s questions and its failure to require financial institutions receiving bailout money to fully account for how they are using the public’s money.

“The recent refusal of certain private financial institutions to provide any accounting of how they are using taxpayer money undermines public confidence,” the draft of the report said. “For Treasury to advance funds to these institutions without requiring more transparency further erodes the very confidence Treasury seeks to restore,” it said.

The 45-page report also asserted that the Treasury, in defiance of what the panel claimed was Congress’s clear intent when it passed the bailout bill in October, had taken “no steps to use any of this money to alleviate the foreclosure crisis.”

The Treasury declined to comment on the panel’s latest findings, with the bailout, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. “We can’t comment on a report that’s not been shared with us,” said Brookly McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Treasury.

But in testimony to Congress and elsewhere, Neel T. Kashkari, the Treasury official overseeing the bailout, has repeatedly asserted that the rescue plan is in fact working as intended. While cautioning that its full effect will take time to register, he has argued that the rescue plan has already begun to reduce foreclosures while also providing crucial stability and liquidity to the financial system.
254 2009-01-09 Re “Kennedy Was Spared Financial Disclosure as a Top Aide at City Schools” (news article, Jan. 4):

I would like to clarify New York City’s financial reporting rules in connection with Caroline Kennedy’s disclosure obligations.

Ms. Kennedy was not obligated to disclose her finances while at the Department of Education because she did not meet any of several legal criteria that required filing — which quite likely explains the “variety of explanations” you report about why she did not file.

You note that others who earned nominal, $1-per-year salaries were obligated to file, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and two of his appointees, and that two of Ms. Kennedy’s deputies had to file.

In fact, conflict-of-interest rules require elected officials like the mayor to disclose their finances, as well as agency heads and those with authority to approve contracts, like his two appointees. The rules at that time also required filing by city employees who earned more than $83,500, as did both of Ms. Kennedy’s deputies.

Ms. Kennedy did not fit into these or any other categories that required disclosure.

Lost here is the fact Ms.

Kennedy has helped raise millions for the city’s schoolchildren while costing taxpayers just $2.
255 2009-01-09 In 2007, Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, wrote a letter to customers called “Thoughts on Music.” The letter was really his thoughts on copyright protection, otherwise called digital rights management, or D.R.M. He pointed out some of the inherent contradictions that most music buyers have noticed — most CDs come with no copy protection, unlike music sold online — and he concluded that “D.R.M.’s haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy.”

Now Apple has followed up on Jobs’s thinking. As of this week, it will begin selling music online without copy protection. Of course, because of its format, music sold through the company’s iTunes Store is playable only on certain types of portable music players, notably the iPod. Buyers also will have to pay more for newer songs than older ones. And Apple will charge a fee to convert old copy-protected music files, en masse, into new, unrestricted files.

Still, this change — like the recording industry’s recent decision to stop prosecuting individual music file-sharers — acknowledges the sea change across the entire music industry. Sales of CDs have dropped by nearly half since their peak in 2000. The sales of albums in any form — collections of songs — have dropped, too, because consumers are buying individual songs instead, which online music stores allow them to do with ease.

We applaud Apple’s decision to do away with the digital rights management software. Apple is acknowledging the failure of the restrictive copyright protections championed by the Recording Industry Association of America.

It also is recognizing something fundamental about music lovers that restriction-free online vendors know. Most of us will buy, not steal, digital music, even if it lacks copyright protection. Shared music is the best advertisement for the music we will eventually purchase.
256 2009-01-09 “This would be almost the biggest endorsement deal in the history of endorsements,” said Doug Shabelman, the president of Burns Entertainment, which arranges deals between celebrities and companies. “He’s consistently seen using it and consistently in the news arguing — and arguing with issues of national security and global welfare — how he absolutely needs this to function on a daily basis.”

Mr. Obama is an ideal marketing representative, other agents say — popular, constantly in the news and explicit about his attachment to the product.

“You always want the celebrity to be a good fit with your brand, and is anybody considered a better communicator right now than Barack Obama, or a better networker?” said Fran Kelly, the chief executive of the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide, who estimated that an endorsement by Mr. Obama would be worth $25 million. “It couldn’t have a better spokesperson.”

Mr. Shabelman put the value even higher, at $50 million or more, because the endorsement is worldwide.

“The worth to a company to have the president always talking about a BlackBerry and how it absolutely is a necessity to keep in touch with reality?” he said. “Think about how far the company has come if they’re able to say, ‘The president has to have this to keep in touch.’ ”

The maker of the BlackBerry, Research in Motion, recently introduced advertising campaigns and products like the touch-screen Storm that are meant to position BlackBerry as not just a business device but a consumer product like the iPhone. The company, which declined to comment on Mr. Obama’s enthusiasm for its product, also struck a sponsorship deal with John Mayer, a popular guitarist but hardly the leader of the free world.

“The most powerful man in the country is saying, at this moment, basically, I can’t live without mine,” Lori Sale, the head of artist marketing at the agency Paradigm, which pairs actors like Adrien Brody and Katherine Heigl with advertisers. “It represents their now complete and final crossover to a device that people adore.”

Ms. Sale said that Mr. Obama had essentially participated in what is called a satellite media tour for BlackBerry by discussing the product with reporters. Just a single day of a media tour, “with the most A-list of A-list of A-list, would probably be 10 to 15 million dollars,” she said.

That he is not paid to promote BlackBerry is even better for R.I.M. “What makes it even more valuable than that is how authentic it is,” she said.

Mr. Kelly said the endorsement went both ways: while Mr. Obama was doing a lot for BlackBerry, BlackBerry had helped Mr. Obama’s image by making his message seem more relevant.

“The BlackBerry anecdotes are a huge part of Obama’s brand reputation,” he said. “It positions him as one of us: he’s got friends and family and people to communicate with us, just like all of us. And it positions him as a next-generation politician.”

Inevitably, perhaps, marketing executives dream about creating an ad featuring the president-elect, something Gene Liebel, a partner in the Brooklyn agency Huge, said would be a “fantasy assignment.”

Asked what tagline he might use for the campaign, Mr. Liebel repeated one his employees had thought up: “If Blagojevich can pick my replacement, I can pick my device.”

R. Vann Graves, the chief creative officer of the UniWorld Group, suggested a campaign showing Mr. Obama in the Oval Office. “In the foreground, you have the desk, but instead of having the proverbial red phone, you have a red BlackBerry,” Mr. Graves said, with the tagline “Shot Caller.”

Matt Reinhard, the executive creative director of DDB Los Angeles, suggested Apple try to steal Mr. Obama away from BlackBerry as a spokesman for the iPhone.

The message could be, “It’s time for change,” Mr. Reinhard said.
257 2009-01-09 The Securities and Exchange Commission has quietly backed away from a rule that had allowed the accounting firm that audited Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities to avoid oversight by a regulator that was created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals.

Brokerage firms like Madoff Securities are required to be audited by firms that were registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which was created under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 to help prevent frauds.

But the S.E.C. promptly issued a rule, which it extended several times, waiving that requirement for privately held brokerage firms. As a result, Friehling & Horowitz, a three-employee accounting firm, was able to continue to audit Madoff without registering with the board. That firm’s audits failed to detect the large Ponzi scheme that Mr. Madoff, the firm’s founder, has now been accused of orchestrating.

In its latest extension of the rule, issued Dec. 12, 2006, the commission said it had determined that allowing such firms not to register was “consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.”

That extension expired at the end of 2008 and was not extended. As a result, firms that audit broker-dealers for fiscal years that end this month or later will have to be registered.

The registration will not, however, lead to inspections by the board of such accounting firms. Under another section of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, it is allowed to inspect only audits of publicly held companies.
258 2009-01-09 The Walt Disney Company confirmed its purchase of the television broadcast rights to two events for the inauguration of Barack Obama. The first, a children’s concert that will be attended by Mr. Obama’s daughters, will be shown on the Disney Channel on Jan. 19, the day before the inauguration. The second event, “The Neighborhood Ball: An Inauguration Celebration,” will be broadcast on ABC, which is owned by Disney, on Jan. 20. Of the many balls the new president will attend that night, ABC said, the neighborhood ball would be his first stop.
259 2009-01-09 The Meredith Corporation shut one of its magazines, Country Home, and dismissed 7 percent of its employees on Thursday, adding to a long list of closings and downsizings in an industry battered by falling advertising.

Meredith said it was eliminating 250 jobs, including about 40 people who work at Country Home, a reduction that Patrick Taylor, a company spokesman, said was effective immediately. The company announced that it was taking a $16 million special charge, which Mr. Taylor said would pay for severance and buyouts.

In an additional cost-saving measure, the company said it was relocating the creative functions of Parents.com, which is based in Manhattan, and ReadyMade, based in Berkeley, Calif., to the corporate headquarters in Des Moines.

“It enables them to really take advantage of the assets we have in Des Moines, like the photo studio and the test kitchen,” Mr. Taylor said.

In a statement, Stephen M. Lacy, the president and chief executive, cited sharply lower advertising, and added, “trends indicate a continuing soft economy into calendar 2009 as well.”
260 2009-01-09 He noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends elective Caesareans not be performed before the 39th week of pregnancy.

Medical problems also occurred more frequently in the small group of babies delivered by Caesarean at 41 weeks and 42 weeks, the study found.

Researchers reviewed a registry containing detailed information about repeat Caesarean births to mothers who had previously had the procedure at 19 medical centers, all part of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network. Of 24,077 Caesarean deliveries performed at term, 13,258 were elective, meaning there was no medical indication for the surgery, the researchers found. Of those, 6.3 percent were performed at 37 weeks and 29.5 percent at 38 weeks.

Overall, 15.3 percent of babies delivered at 37 weeks suffered a complication of some kind, compared with 11 percent of those born at 38 weeks and only 7.3 percent of those born at 40 weeks. One infant, delivered at 39 weeks, died. Doctors noted that even when babies born by Caesarean are delivered at the same week of pregnancy as babies delivered vaginally, they are at higher risk of respiratory difficulties because the process of labor and delivery primes the fetal lungs for breathing air.

Babies delivered by Caesarean section at 37 weeks were 4.2 times more likely than those delivered at 39 weeks to suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, and 3.3 times more likely to be treated for hypoglycemia, 2.9 times more likely to develop an infection or to be suspected of having an infection, and more than twice as likely to be hospitalized for five or more days or to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Babies delivered by Caesarean section at 38 weeks were 2.1 times more likely than those delivered at 39 weeks to suffer respiratory distress syndrome, 1.8 times more likely to be hospitalized for five or more days, and 1.7 times more likely to have an infection or be suspected of having an infection. Babies delivered by Caesarean at 38 weeks had a 30 percent increased risk of hypoglycemia and a 50 percent increased risk of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, compared to those delivered at 39 weeks.

“Faced with the likelihood that there is no other problem, I think it’s prudent to wait until 39 weeks to avoid subjecting these babies to adverse outcomes,” Dr. Tita said. He added that he did not think the results would be different for women undergoing a first elective Caesarean section, versus the repeat Caesareans looked at in this study.

Reactions to the study were mixed. Dr. Michael Greene, director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an editorial that accompanied the article, said the paper quantifies differences in risk that many physicians may not be aware of.

“I would bet if you ask the first 10 obstetricians on the street if they thought it would make a difference to deliver a baby in the second half of the 38th week and the first half of the 39th week, they’d say, ’Nah, it’s not a big difference,’ ” he said. “This study, because of its size and numbers, is able to say, Yeah, it does make a difference.’ ”

At the same time, he said the study only reviewed live births and did not weigh the risk of a potential stillbirth that could occur with a longer pregnancy against the risk of a complication resulting from an earlier Caesarean.

“The apparent simple message from this study is too simplistic,” he said. “There is a tiny, small but real increase in stillbirths late in pregnancy for women who had a prior Caesarean section, as opposed to women with no scar in their uterus” from a previous Caesarean section.

But Dr. Alan Fleischman, medical director of the March of Dimes, said the findings should reinforce the message that “every week counts” in a pregnancy. The women who were more likely to deliver early were white women with private health insurance, and the medical centers were all top-notch hospitals, he noted.

“These are not preterm babies, and these are pregnancies that should have good outcomes,” he said.
261 2009-01-09 The revised bill that Citigroup endorsed would allow bankruptcy judges to adjust the principal payments or interest rates on existing loans.

Judges could also extend the terms on mortgage loans, according to the language of the bill, which would force lenders to take losses without a say in bankruptcy court proceedings.

Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said he and fellow backers of the plan see it as a way to create more voluntary negotiations between struggling homeowners and financial institutions. So far, voluntary programs have proved ineffective, Democrats said.

Citigroup had been part of the Bankruptcy Coalition of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, since it aggressively lobbied for changes to the bankruptcy code in 2005.

The coalition — a group of major trade associations and lenders like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo — also fought to block the so-called cramdown legislation last year.

No other bank has broken ranks with the industry on the proposed bill. Mr. Durbin said he hoped the move by Citigroup, should other banks and financial trade associations take the same stance, would lead to backing by enough Democrats and moderate Republicans to push the bill through.

Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he had been contacting officials of top financial institutions for months, trying to persuade them that it would be to their advantage to back the plan since it could help stabilize a housing market that has severely hurt the economy.

Three changes were made to the legislation sponsored by Mr. Durbin and Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee: only existing mortgages will be eligible; homeowners will have to certify they tried to contact their mortgage holder lenders regarding loan modifications before filing for bankruptcy; and only major violations of the Truth in Lending Act will cause lenders to forfeit their claims in a bankruptcy.

Backed by bankers and other financial groups, many Congressional Republicans and some Democrats have balked at the plan to let bankruptcy judges alter mortgage terms on primary residences, saying that would drive up mortgage costs.

But officials said financial institutions were coming to the conclusion that it might be better to get a reduced loan payment through a bankruptcy or voluntary negotiations than to get no money at all.

Aides to Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate banking committee, said he would have no immediate response to the plan.

Scott E. Talbott, senior vice president for government affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, said the group opposed cramdown legislation because it “creates huge risks” for the mortgage market.

He suggested the bill would force banks to further restrict lending and absorb huge losses as the economy worsens. He also suggested the bill would create perverse incentives that might encourage more homeowners to seek bankruptcy protection.

Citigroup recently began negotiating with lawmakers, in a move that some observers suggest reflects its desire to win favor on Capitol Hill after receiving billions in funds from the bailout program.

The government has invested $45 billion in Citigroup and agreed to guarantee about $269 billion in highly illiquid mortgage investments.

“If you’re looking at a way to get to the bottom of the economic problems in our country, this is the cause of our economic problems,” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee. “It is the housing foreclosure problem. We’ve got to address that.”

The plan has been backed by members of Congress who see it as a way to help distressed homeowners and balance federal relief efforts that have been aimed at Wall Street and the automobile industry.

Mr. Schumer said he had been in contact with other large banks and he expected they would soon announce their support or at least drop their opposition to the plan.

“Citigroup’s action has broken the dam,” he said.
262 2009-01-09 “Yonkers Joe” offers more information than you probably ever wanted to know about crooked small-time gamblers and the sophisticated surveillance techniques employed by casinos to detect them.

The title character (Chazz Palminteri, the movie’s executive producer), who lives in Yonkers, is a card sharp and virtuoso at slipping loaded dice into crap games. Unlike the majority of movie criminals, Joe suffers self-pitying pangs of conscience about an occupation that provides him with a modest living. When forced to take care of his uncontrollable 20-year-old son, who has Down syndrome and has just been ejected from the institution where he has spent the last 12 years, Joe grouses that it is “payback for what I do.”

Joe Jr., convincingly played by Tom Guiry, is an unmanageable handful who acts out every impulse. Resentful of his father for ignoring him during a hospitalization that began when his mother abandoned the family, he lashes out in wild-animal tantrums whenever he is thwarted.

As “Yonkers Joe,” written and directed by Robert Celestino, gathers momentum, it becomes an unwieldy if absorbing hybrid of incompatible movies. One is a diabolical David Mamet caper comedy in which Joe engineers a score that will give him the means to place Joe Jr. in a fancy hospital. The other is an inspirational family drama heavily indebted to “Rain Man,” a film in which gambling also figured prominently.

With its behind-the-scenes view of a seedy criminal enterprise in which we observe the preparation of loaded dice and the sly, conspiratorial glances shared by Joe and his crew as they fleece naïve gamblers in backrooms and at a clambake, “Yonkers Joe” is far more persuasive in its ersatz-Mamet mode than as a tear-jerker. The petty crook Joe is one of the meatiest roles of Mr. Palminteri’s career.
263 2009-01-09 In the boom years of 2004 through 2006, there were fewer than 100 negative announcements each year — the three best years in that regard since S.& P. started collecting data in 1955.

Companies appeared to be flush with cash during those days, but some of that was a mirage stemming from optimistic accounting, particularly at banks. In other cases, the cash was real but it did not stay in corporate treasuries very long. Wall Street was preaching the doctrine of shareholder value, and corporate America bought shares back at an unprecedented rate.

From the fourth quarter of 2004 through the third quarter of 2008, the companies in the S.& P. 500 — generally the largest companies in the country — reported net earnings of $2.4 trillion. They paid $900 billion in dividends, but they also repurchased $1.7 trillion in shares.

As a group, shareholders were paid about $200 billion more than their companies earned over that four-year period. Suffering investors who held onto their shares during the 2008 plunge may want to reflect on the fact that investors who were dumping shares got roughly twice as much of the money as the loyal holders did.

It was not only public companies that were able to pay dividends with cash that might have come from lenders rather than profits. Private equity firms were able to bolster their returns by having companies they owned borrow more money and use the cash to pay dividends. Now some of those same companies are struggling to find cash to finance operations.

The pain from the excessive payouts to shareholders from years past will be amplified by the fact that corporate loans have a lot in common with the exploding mortgages that came to dominate the home mortgage market before it collapsed.

Until the recent boom, the vast majority of home mortgages called for the homeowner to make monthly payments for up to 30 years, with the loan paid off by the time the payments stopped. With fixed-rate mortgages, the payment was constant, so a homeowner who kept his or her job could repay the loan even if the home’s value fell. Even with adjustable-rate mortgages, there would be no increased payment unless market interest rates rose.

The new mortgages ended that. Some were known as 3-27 or 2-28 mortgages, with a teaser interest rate for the first two or three years, and then a sharp increase in payment no matter what happened to market rates. Others were interest-only, or called for payments of even less than the interest being accrued. The common thread was that the borrower would have to refinance at some point. Now, of course, many cannot. Their homes are not worth what is owed, or their income is not adequate to support such a loan under the tighter prevailing standards.

In the business sector of the economy, similar loan terms were common. Many companies were financed by bank lines of credit that had to be renewed every few years. Even bond issues were only for 5 or 10 years. Most commercial real estate loans in recent years called for payments of just the interest, with the entire loan to be refinanced within 10 years.

To make things seem even better during the good years, lenders were willing to lend larger sums, assuming that rents would rise rapidly in commercial buildings, or that profits would do the same at companies. Where that did not happen — which is to say at most places — many loans will not be able to be rolled over when they mature. Unnecessary bankruptcies loom.

So did dividends lie? Perhaps they were simply misunderstood. Their real message from 2004 through 2006 was not that corporate America was doing so well. It was that lenders had embarked on an unsustainable credit expansion that was sure to end in tears.
264 2009-01-09 When Barack Obama takes office as president, he should immediately change or even scrap many cold-war-era regulations on high-tech exports and on immigration by foreign scientists and engineers, an expert panel said Thursday.

Restricting foreigners’ access to strategically important technology might have been useful decades ago, when the United States was the undisputed world leader across the technological spectrum, the panel said in a report issued by the National Academy of Sciences. But today, it said, the nation is losing scientific and engineering dominance even as militarily useful advances come increasingly from civilian research.

The regulations do little for the nation’s security, the panel said, while significantly hampering economic growth and innovation.

“We have failed to distinguish between technology which really does pose a fundamental threat, such as things having to do with nuclear weapons, and technologies which are broadly available,” like some computer or telecommunication technology, John Hennessy, a co-chairman of the panel, said in an interview. “In some cases, we have technologies that go on our export control list that are legally available outside the United States in unrestricted form.”

The National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, convened the expert panel, headed by Dr. Hennessy, an electrical engineer who is president of Stanford; and Brent Scowcroft, the retired Air Force general who was national security adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush. The report is at www.nas.edu.

Export rules or immigration restrictions on scientists and engineers draw little public attention, but they are an important part of what some analysts call “the ecology of innovation,” factors in society that inhibit or enhance the development of useful and profitable technologies.

Over the years, several federal panels and private groups have suggested changes in the rules. But the report said the issue never gained political traction because it was “arcane” and “under the radar” of most Americans.

Other experts say some potential critics held back for fear of being labeled soft on national security. That fear arose often when the country in question was China, which is progressing quickly in computing, aerospace and other high-tech areas.

Mr. Scowcroft said the restrictions limited the collaboration of American scientists and engineers with colleagues from other countries, “harming our national security by harming our economy.”

He said in an interview that the government should assume that technology was eligible for export unless shown to be a danger, rather than requiring would-be exporters to prove the opposite.

Dr. Hennessy said it would be difficult to put a dollar figure on the costs the regulatory environment had exacted on the American economy. But, he said: “It inhibits companies from going into certain technologies. They don’t want to deal with the whole uncertainty.”

The people expected to deal with these issues in the Obama administration would not comment on the report. But in a technology position paper issued during his presidential campaign, Mr. Obama said he supported “comprehensive immigration reform” to encourage skilled workers to enter and remain in the United States.

Speaking of the aerospace industry, he said he would review export rules that had “unduly hampered” competitiveness.

In their report, panel members said they had deliberately designed recommendations that could be put into effect at once, through an executive order, which they said should be “one of the first orders of business in January.”

But Baker Spring, a national security analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, said that while there might be merit in some immediate changes, anything that could be done quickly “is almost certain to be incomplete.”

Mr. Spring, who said he had not read the report, said he favored a country-by-country approach because policies appropriate for “close allies” like Britain or Australia might not be appropriate for countries like China.

Among other things, the panel said the president should do the following:

¶Restructure the export-control process to advance economic competitiveness as well as national security, allowing “openness and engagement to prevail unless a compelling case can be made for restrictions” which, in turn, must have “a rational basis.”

¶Require controls to be reassessed at least yearly.

¶Establish two independent panels within the National Security Council to assess controls and decide disputes about export limits.

¶Streamline the visa process for scientists and engineers and automatically allow foreign students to remain in the country at least a year after earning advanced degrees in scientific or technical fields.

¶Allow American experts to vouch for “well-known scholars and researchers” seeking to enter the United States.

“The U.S. cannot protect U.S. jobs by denying access to foreign professionals,” the panel said. “Jobs will simply go abroad.”

271 2009-01-10 WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Barack Obama’s economic team is in talks with the Bush administration to have Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. ask Congress next week for access to the $350 billion left in the financial bailout fund so Mr. Obama could begin tapping it soon after his inauguration.

Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats also want to apply greater scrutiny and a more defined mission to the $700 billion rescue program.

The House could act next week on a new tack for the Troubled Asset Relief Program that would set tougher conditions on recipients of the money, including limits on executive pay, and require the Treasury Department to use some of the money to reduce mortgage foreclosures.
272 2009-01-10 In “The End of the Financial World as We Know It” (Op-Ed, Jan. 4), Michael Lewis and David Einhorn make some disparaging comments about the value of credit ratings. Credit ratings represent our opinion of the creditworthiness of a bond issuer and the likelihood that an obligation will be repaid on time, in full, with interest. It’s a process that historically has worked well, allowing bond issuers worldwide to build roads, schools, factories and businesses.

We take issue with the authors’ speculations about why we did not downgrade a bond insurer. We have taken such actions on several bond insurers over the past year, and we will continue to express our views when appropriate.

At any given point, investors may disagree with our ratings. The issuer-pays business model allows us to publish not only our ratings but also our models used in forming our opinions free on our Web site.

Mr. Lewis and Mr. Einhorn (and anyone else) are free to challenge our opinions, draw their own conclusions and make their own investment decisions.

One thing is certain: if forced to rely solely on a subscription-based model, accessing this research would be costly and likely beyond the reach of most investors.
273 2009-01-10 According to Education Ministry officials, about 350,000 South Korean students went abroad in 2007, most of them university-age but some in elementary school and even kindergarten. South Koreans have become the largest group of foreign students in the United States, according to American government statistics, outnumbering even those from China, with a population much larger than South Korea’s 48 million people.

“The strong won made overseas education become affordable, perhaps too affordable, for more South Koreans,” said Choi Won-seok, an executive director at uhak.com, an agency based in Seoul that helps students study abroad. “Korea experienced a study-abroad bubble.”

Now there are early signs that the bubble may be deflating.

In October, the Education Ministry said the number of elementary and secondary students going abroad fell in the first half of 2008 for the first time since the government started keeping count a decade ago. In a separate report, the central bank said spending on overseas education fell by 5.8 percent in the same period from the year before to $2.3 billion, the largest decline since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

While job security and the overall slowing of the economy play a role, the biggest factor has been the rapidly falling won, education experts and students say. The currency’s drop from a peak of nearly 900 per dollar in mid-2008 to about 1,360 per dollar now translates to a 50 percent price increase in foreign goods — like tuition, room and board, and airfare — in just a few months.

To be sure, Mr. Choi and others say, many South Koreans seeking advanced degrees, especially at top American or European universities, are likely to go anyway.

However, a larger number of students enroll in short-term, often one-year programs, to study English or other languages. Last year, some 150,000 South Koreans went abroad for this kind of study. This year, the number is likely to fall by 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Choi said.

Some of those forced to abandon their plans fear the decision could hurt their prospects.

Kang Youn-mo, a 24-year-old French major, canceled plans to go to Paris in December to study for at least two months. She said she now felt intimidated by college classmates who had studied abroad and spoke better French.

“I feel at a disadvantage,” she said. “The global economy has not been good to me.”

Those still going abroad face other problems. Lee Min-hye, a 22-year-old bioengineering major at Yonsei University in Seoul, had planned to study English in Boston and dreamed of strolling through Boston Common, which she saw once in a movie. But then the won’s decline pushed the price of tuition above her father’s annual salary as a semiconductor engineer.

After much agonizing, she decided to attend a school in Sydney that costs about 40 percent less.

“You can’t give up if you want a good job in the future,” she said. “You have to go abroad somewhere to keep up with all the other Koreans who study abroad.”

Other South Koreans are choosing still cheaper countries for English-language study, such as South Africa and Malaysia. One of the most popular low-cost destinations is the Philippines, where students can live in resort-like accommodations and receive one-on-one lessons for about $750 a month.

Some education experts worry that if the financial crisis drags on, it could worsen social inequalities by making study abroad at top schools a privilege affordable only for the wealthy.

“Upper-middle-class families will still have the ability to send their children abroad, even if it means great sacrifice,” said Oh Ookwhan, a professor of education at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “This will allow them to stay ahead of less fortunate families.”

Fear of falling behind makes most South Koreans reluctant to abandon their plans, even if they have to postpone them. Ms. Seo, who canceled her studies in Sydney, said she remained determined to go, despite pressure from family and friends to settle down in Seoul and get married. She has tried to save more money and keep up her English skills while waiting for the crisis to pass.

“I feel insecure, just waiting like this,” she said. “But I won’t give up my education.”
274 2009-01-10 “The tragic question is how long can the city survive this desperate annual crisis?” he wrote, adding that it seemed “ludicrous that the largest city in the nation” should be “totally dependent for its fiscal and administrative survival on an annual begging session that results in little sympathy much less actual relief.”

Mr. Panetta embraced a radical regime change that had been advanced by Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin during their joint 1969 campaign for mayor and City Council president.

“Statehood — while initiated somewhat facetiously during the last campaign — is not an unrealistic possibility,” he wrote. “Indeed, it may well be the only sensible approach to governing New York City.”

Mr. Panetta acknowledged that “there are, of course, enough problems these days facing the city without taking on the implications of statehood.” And he warned, in a version of C.I.A.-speak, that seceding to form a separate state could trigger a “wild and possible vicious” power struggle.

Still, he concluded, the city would come out ahead. He strongly recommended to Mr. Lindsay that the possibility be pursued.

Mr. Rockefeller denounced the 51st-state proposal as childish, and it withered as the city and state appointed competing commissions to examine intergovernmental relations.

“It was a nonstarter,” recalled William J. vanden Heuvel, who headed the city commission named by Mr. Lindsay.

Mr. Panetta resigned later that year, frustrated with blurred lines of jurisdiction and bureaucracy (problems he is likely to confront again at the C.I.A.). Like Mr. Lindsay, he became a Democrat.

A confidential subject file in the college’s La Guardia and Wagner Archives gives more insights into how Mr. Panetta might perform in another covert role.

In thoughtful and pointedly strategic memos often leavened by a pithy “comment for the day,” Mr. Panetta suggested that the mayor unveil “mock budgets” to dramatize the impact of proposed deficits without more state and federal aid, lower penalties for marijuana possession, shift many city prisoners to state custody, limit appeals when defendants are denied a post-conviction remedy, and transfer more responsibility for United Nations security to federal officials.

He complained about a double standard regarding Albany. “When the state fails in such areas as narcotics addiction, corrections and transportation, it is in view of the fact that it has far greater power to control its resources and is directly responsible for far fewer areas of public services,” Mr. Panetta wrote. “When the city fails in such areas as welfare or housing, it is in view of the fact that it has little power to determine what resources will be available and a far greater responsibility for numerous other services to people.”

He also said the New York’s Congressional delegation liked to take credit for federal grants, while leaving federal failings to Mr. Lindsay.

Speaking of Congress, Mr. Panetta enjoys another unheralded distinction: No one else lost a New Yorker as a roommate because of the constitutional separation of powers. When he and Charles E. Schumer were both congressmen, they shared an apartment on Capitol Hill with their landlord, Representative George Miller of California. When Mr. Panetta joined the Clinton administration, he had to move out because it was considered a conflict for an executive branch employee to pay rent to a member of Congress.

In his confirmation hearings, some questions may be raised about Mr. Panetta’s lack of formal intelligence-gathering credentials, but it appears unlikely that either his coup attempt or roommate conflict will surface then. Still, Stu Loeser, who used to work for Mr. Schumer and is now Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s chief spokesman, mused about whether Mr. Panetta, now 70, had been thinking strategically even 40 years ago.

“It’s not clear to those of us back at City Hall,” Mr. Loeser said, “that Mr. Panetta’s ascent to the leadership of the C.I.A. isn’t, in fact, the final stage of his long-held plans.”
275 2009-01-10 At the Baltimore event last weekend, 23 of the 45 riders wore them, the first time that those with helmets outnumbered those without. At last month’s National Finals Rodeo, the championship of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, J. W. Harris became the second rider in three years to win the bull-riding title while wearing a helmet.

These are considered watershed events in the continuing struggle to persuade riders to trade felt Stetsons for a sturdy helmet with a titanium grille.

“It is huge,” said Don Andrews, executive director of the medical team that travels with the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.

Bull riding fancies itself as the original extreme sport. One in 15 rides on the Professional Bull Riders’ top tour — which is at Madison Square Garden this weekend — ends with an injury, said Dr. Tandy Freeman, the tour’s medical director. Fifteen percent of the injuries, he said, are concussions. The most common surgical procedure is to repair facial fractures.

“It makes sense to wear a helmet,” Dr. Freeman said. “But not everything these guys do makes sense.”

Studies show that trying to cling to the back of a bucking and spinning bull for eight seconds is far more dangerous than playing football or hockey, sports in which helmets are mandatory. For relatively newer thrill-seeking pursuits, like snowboarding and skateboarding, the use of a helmet is rarely debated anymore. Most participants have always worn one.

“It’s just a cowboy thing,” said Ty Murray, the most decorated rodeo cowboy in history, who is 39 and retired from competition. “America, the whole idea of the iconic cowboy wearing a hat — any other sport people would say, ‘Yeah, they should wear a helmet.’ ”

Murray never did. A few years ago only a handful of riders wore helmets, and usually only after sustaining a head injury. Helmets are only now being viewed as precautionary, not reactionary.

Murray’s career ended with his tattered knees in braces.

“If I had my career to do over again, I would have worn the braces before I was injured,” he said. And he would have probably worn a helmet.

Amid great debate, the Professional Bull Riders and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, along with most youth rodeo organizations, have not made helmets mandatory. That is partly because of a reluctance to require helmets in a sport and a culture that cherishes independence. It is mostly because no manufacturer mass-produces a helmet that meets the safety standard for riding atop a 1,500-pound bull, tour officials said. If one did, it would be prohibitively expensive.

“If someone mandates the use of a helmet that is not researched and approved for bull riding, they would open themselves up to liability,” Andrews said.

For now, the hope is that children in rodeo will grow up wearing helmets because their parents require them to, and that they will continue to wear them as professionals because their peers do.

To the relief of the two associations, that wait-and-hope strategy is slowly working.

“It’s something where in a couple of years you won’t see guys without helmets,” Murray said. “It’ll be like looking at old football pictures where they don’t have face masks.”

Hockey might be a more apt comparison. Helmets were a sign of weakness, even among some goalies, before Bill Masterton, a player for the Minnesota North Stars, died of a head injury in 1968. Soon, stars like the Blackhawks’ Stan Mikita wore helmets. In 1979 the N.H.L. required incoming players to wear them.

Fatal accidents have prompted a similar arc in rodeo. The champion bull rider Lane Frost died in 1989 when he was gored by a bull’s horn. Cody Lambert, a rider and good friend, developed a padded leather vest, a type worn by bull riders today.

Brent Thurman died in 1994 when a bull’s hoof crushed his skull at the National Finals Rodeo. That prompted Morris Futch, his own bull-riding career ended by a serious head injury, to develop bull-riding helmets. His company, Bulltough, essentially fits hockey-style helmets with titanium face masks. They sell for about $500.

Vests, however, look like something a cowboy would wear. Helmets do not. With no standard in place, helmet styles vary widely. The winner of the Baltimore P.B.R. event, Kasey Hayes, 23, wore a face mask with a leather strap, akin to an old catcher’s mask, topped by his cowboy hat. It is the same one he has worn since he was 12.

Riders no longer question when someone like Brendon Clark, 28, begins wearing a helmet, which he did near the end of his sixth Professional Bull Riders season last fall. He had six concussions in 2008.

“All my buddies were like, ‘You’ve got to wake up,’ ” Clark said. “I was a typical cowboy — ‘I don’t need it.’ ”

There is little doubt that the helmets help prevent injuries, or the severity of them, but it is difficult to gauge how much. Freeman said riders with helmets still sustained plenty of concussions.

“I’ve seen guys get stepped on, and their helmet is shattered into five pieces,” Freeman said. “They end up with a concussion and a scrape on their scalp, and you think, intuitively, it would have been a lot worse without a helmet.”

But some riders find the weight of the helmet distracting. Some find their sightlines limited. Several said that helmeted riders seem to bang heads with bulls (known as being jerked down, or dashboarded) more often than those without, speculating that it might be because they ride with false invincibility.

“I still think there’s got to be a little bit of cowboy in this sport,” said Dustin Elliott, a tour veteran who does not wear a helmet.

“If you’re not a little bit scared, then you shouldn’t be doing it.”

Increasingly, though, riders are scared of going without a helmet. On the Professional Bull Riders tour, last year’s top rider, Guilherme Marchi (without a helmet), earned more than $1.5 million and 22 others made at least $100,000. They do not get paid if they do not ride.

That is part of why the stigma of wearing a helmet is disappearing, even at the expense of the iconic cowboy hat.

“It’s not about that anymore,” Clark said. “You can’t make money in this sport if you’re at home with a busted face.”

Down the hall, Shivers and his broken nose were out of the competition.
276 2009-01-10 Merisant Worldwide, a maker of low-calorie tabletop sweeteners like Equal and Canderel, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, weighed down by increased competition and too much debt. The company, based in Chicago, and five affiliates filed for protection from creditors with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Merisant’s market share had declined in recent years amid competition from Splenda and other sweeteners.
277 2009-01-10 The Boeing Company plans to cut about 3 percent of its work force as a weakening global economy reduces demand for jetliners. Boeing, of Chicago, said it expected to cut 4,500 jobs from its passenger jet business. Boeing reported a 15 percent drop in passenger jet deliveries for 2008. Plane orders fell by more than half last year.
278 2009-01-10 Mr. Morgan, who was known as Chuck, also led the A.C.L.U. effort to have President Richard M. Nixon impeached.

Mr. Morgan, one of the most colorful lawyers in a region known for them, first came to public attention because of a speech that got him run out of his hometown, Birmingham, Ala. The day after the Ku Klux Klan bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and killed four black girls at Sunday school in 1963, he had taken to a podium and blamed the pillars of Birmingham for the killings: politicians who catered to racist votes and newspaper editors, church leaders and business leaders who refused to take responsibility for the pervasive racial hatred in the city.

“Every person in this community who has in any way contributed during the past several years to the popularity of hatred is at least as guilty, or more so, than the demented fool who threw that bomb,” Mr. Morgan said.

The speech destroyed his budding law practice, which he had already damaged by taking on unpopular civil rights cases, and it led to death threats against his family. He moved to Atlanta to become the Southern director of the A.C.L.U. in 1964, the same year he published a book on his Birmingham experience, “A Time to Speak.”

Charles Morgan Jr. was born March 11, 1930, in Cincinnati and reared in Kentucky. When he was 15, the family moved to Birmingham. He met and married Camille Walpole at the University of Alabama, where he earned a law degree. They had a son, Charles Morgan III. Besides his wife and his son, Mr. Morgan is survived by four grandchildren.

A bulky man, Mr. Morgan held court every day after work in his smoky, whiskey-stained office in Atlanta or, if he were traveling, propped up in a hotel bed in some distant town. His visitors were fellow lawyers, reporters, civil rights advocates and liberal politicians who hovered at the center of the 1960s civil rights movement. He enjoyed performing, whether in the company of friends or in the hearing room of the Supreme Court.

He moved into the campaign against the Vietnam War in 1967, when he represented Capt. Howard Levy at his court-martial at Fort Jackson, S.C. Captain Levy had refused an order to teach dermatology to medical aidmen in Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, saying he considered them “killers of peasants and murderers of women and children.” A military court sentenced him to three years in prison; he served more than two years and became a cause célèbre in the antiwar movement.

Mr. Morgan’s best-known case after he became head of the Washington office of the A.C.L.U. was Mr. Ali’s. Citing his Islamic religious beliefs, Mr. Ali had claimed conscientious-objector status in refusing to be drafted and had been stripped of his heavyweight boxing title because of that stand. After Mr. Ali was convicted of draft evasion in a lower court, Mr. Morgan and the A.C.L.U. took over an appeal of the case, which went to the Supreme Court. It ruled in Mr. Ali’s favor in 1971.

Mr. Morgan’s growing disaffection with the national headquarters of the A.C.L.U. came to a boil in early 1976. At a Washington party, a New York liberal told him that he opposed Jimmy Carter of Georgia for president because, he said, “I could never vote for anybody with a Southern accent.” Mr. Morgan replied, “That’s bigotry, and that makes you a bigot.”

When the encounter was reported in The New York Times, Mr. Morgan was reprimanded by Aryeh Neier, the executive director of the A.C.L.U., and Mr. Morgan resigned.

Mr. Morgan spent the rest of his career in private practice. He earned large fees and incurred criticism from old friends when he represented large corporations against what he portrayed as government efforts to abridge their rights. He once represented the Tobacco Institute in its opposition to no-smoking laws. He also won major cases for Sears, Roebuck & Company over accusations of race and sex discrimination brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

But it was as an effective voice for civil rights and equal treatment under the law that Mr. Morgan was most remembered in public statements after his death. Less frequently noted was that he also considered himself a proud son of the South and an optimistic champion of its better nature.

“The civil rights movement is freeing the Negro from the bondage of slavery,” he once told a group of Southerners in the 1960s, “and the South is being freed from the bondage of the Negro, and the nation will be freed from the bondage of the South. And then you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to recreate America.”
279 2009-01-10 SEATTLE — The Boeing Company, the airplane maker, is planning to cut about 3 percent of its work force as jetliner demand falls, hurt by the global economic downturn.

The Chicago-based company on Friday said that it expected to cut about 4,500 positions from its passenger jet business, which has factories in the Seattle area. Many of the cuts will be in areas not directly associated with aircraft production.

The news comes a day after Boeing reported a 15 percent decline in passenger jet deliveries for 2008, when it faced an eight-week strike by union workers and shrinking airline demand.

Orders for Boeing planes, meanwhile, plunged by more than half last year, following three years of exceptionally strong bookings, a grim reminder that carriers have been scaling back spending since the summer to cope with fewer air travelers.

Most of the job cuts announced Friday are expected to occur in Washington state in the second quarter of the year, the company said. Boeing says employees will receive 60-day notices starting in late February.

“We have made significant strides in recent years to achieve greater efficiency and productivity, but we still face challenges that we must address,” Scott Carson, president and chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, said in a statement.
280 2009-01-10 WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would decide whether Congress overstepped its constitutional authority in 2006 by extending a central provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The plaintiff in the case, a Texas municipal utility district, has argued that Congress did not take sufficient account of more than four decades of progress toward racial equality that culminated in the recent election of the nation’s first black president.

The court’s decision, expected by June, will help define the Roberts court. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. opposed efforts to expand the voting rights law in 1982 as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration and has expressed skepticism on the court about racial classifications made by the government. The decision will also have significant practical consequences for elections in 16 states.

“This could be the biggest election-law case on the court’s docket since Bush v. Gore,” said Richard L. Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

The case concerns the requirement in Section 5 of the law that certain state and local governments, mostly in the South, must obtain permission, or “preclearance,” from the Justice Department or a federal court before making changes that affect voting.

The requirement applies to all of nine states  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia  and to scores of counties and municipalities in other states that Congress found had a history of discrimination at the polls.

Critics of the law call the preclearance requirement a unique federal intrusion on state sovereignty and a badge of shame for the affected jurisdictions that is no longer justified.

The preclearance requirement, originally set to expire in five years, was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1966 as a rational response to the often flagrantly lawless conduct of Southern officials intent on “perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees.”

Congress has repeatedly extended the requirement: for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in 1982. Congress renewed the act in 2006 after holding extensive hearings on the persistence of racial discrimination at the polls, again extending the preclearance requirement for 25 years.

The lawsuit challenging the requirement was brought by a municipal utility district in Austin, Tex., established on undeveloped land there in the late 1980s. The district said it had never been accused of voting discrimination and should not be made to seek federal permission to, say, move the location of polling places or consolidate voting for its five-member board with the larger county ballot.

A special three-judge court here upheld the constitutionality of the preclearance requirement in May, saying Congress had acted reasonably in making the judgment that voting discrimination persisted.

The utility district argued to the Supreme Court that Congress had given insufficient weight to social and political changes since the civil rights era. It added that the applicable legal standards had changed since 1966.

There is no reason, the district’s lawyers told the justices, to presume “that jurisdictions first identified four decades ago as needing extraordinary federal oversight” today remain “uniformly incapable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations to faithfully protect the voting rights of all citizens in those parts of the country.”

In addition, the district argued, a 1997 Supreme Court decision, City of Boerne v. Flores, imposed a more demanding standard for deciding whether Congress exceeded its authority than mere rationality by requiring “congruence and proportionality” between the harm in question and the means used to prevent it.

The special court had ruled that the more relaxed level of scrutiny used by the Supreme Court to uphold the law in the 1966 case, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, should apply. But it added that the recent extension of the preclearance requirement passed the more demanding “congruence and proportionality” test, too.
281 2009-01-10 Federal prosecutors said Friday that they had dropped charges against David A. Stockman, the former budget director in the Reagan administration, in connection with his role in the bankrupt auto parts maker Collins & Aikman.

“After a renewed assessment of the evidence,” Lev Dassin, acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement, “the government has concluded that further prosecution of this case would not be in the interests of justice.”

Mr. Stockman, 62, the company’s former chief executive, and three other executives — J. Michael Stepp, David R. Cosgrove and Paul C. Barnaba — were indicted in March 2007 and charged with bank fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

At issue was whether the four hid the failing financial health of the auto parts maker from investors. The indictment accused Mr. Stockman of orchestrating an effort to dupe lenders, exaggerating how much money the company was due in its accounts receivable so it could obtain more credit.

At the time, Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said: “They resorted to lies, tricks and fraud.”

A major part of Mr. Stockman’s defense has been that he and others were investing more money to try to save the company until it filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Stockman joined the company three years earlier after a buyout firm that he co-founded, Heartland Industries Partners, bought a controlling stake.
282 2009-01-10 WASHINGTON — Businesses cut their wholesale inventories for a third consecutive month in November as sales continued to plummet by record amounts, further evidence of the severe recession gripping the country.

The Commerce Department reported Friday that wholesale inventories dropped 0.6 percent in November while sales were down a record 7.1 percent.

Businesses are expected to keep paring inventories in coming months as sales weaken further in the midst of a recession that is already the longest in a quarter-century. Many economists do not expect a recovery to begin until the second half of this year.

The 0.6 percent decline in inventories was slightly smaller than the 0.8 percent drop that economists had expected. The government revised the decline in October inventories to show a drop of 1.2 percent, however, even worse than the 1.1 percent fall reported earlier. Inventories fell by 0.4 percent in September.

The declines reflected the struggle businesses were having trying to keep stockpiles in line with plunging sales. The 7.1 percent drop in sales at the wholesale level in November was a record, surpassing the old mark of a 4.5 percent drop set in October. The 2.1 percent drop in September wholesale sales had tied a record from April 2003.

287 2009-01-11 The Columbus Blue Jackets acquired left wing Mike Blunden from the Chicago Blackhawks in a trade for right wing Adam Pineault. The Blue Jackets assigned Blunden to their A.H.L. affiliate in Syracuse. The 22-year-old Blunden has tallied three goals and seven assists in 37 games with the Blackhawks’ A.H.L. affiliate this season. He was drafted into the N.H.L. in 2005.
288 2009-01-11 “I’m sector-agnostic,” he said. “If I like the company, I put it in the portfolio. And my fund is biased toward big themes.”

Among his themes is the aging of Japan — about one in five Japanese are 65 or older, according to the country’s national statistics bureau. Mr. Ishida said he reasoned that older people long for companionship and thus acquire pets, so he accumulated a big stake in Unicharm Petcare, which makes pet supplies.

Similarly, as people age in Japan and elsewhere, Mr. Ishida expects them to turn to more health care. So he gravitated to medical device companies like Sysmex and Terumo. But he shunned Japanese drug makers because he rates them as costly compared with their counterparts in the United States.

“Why pay 15 times earnings for a big Japanese pharma,” Mr. Ishida asks, “when you can buy Johnson & Johnson at 10 times earnings?”

The fund, which carries a 1.23 percent expense ratio, has had an uneven record. It has performed well lately — Mr. Ishida took over two years ago — but it has been erratic over longer periods. Over the five years that ended Dec. 31, it lost 3.5 percent, annualized, putting it among the worst-performing international funds for that stretch. But over 10 years, it fared better, with an annualized return of 2.4 percent, 1.1 percentage points better than its peers.

Like Mr. Ishida, Mario J. Gabelli, of the Gabelli ABC fund, does not emphasize whether a stock appears in an index or represents a particular sector when he makes picks for the portfolio.

Mr. Gabelli earned his reputation as a value investor — someone who tries to find stocks trading for less than his estimate of their intrinsic worth. Value managers typically seek out-of-favor offerings and hold them for a long time. But with Gabelli ABC, Mr. Gabelli wants a lot of small, quick gains that can add up to a stable return.

“This fund is designed to always be up,” he said. “And we’re willing to give up upside to do that. It’s not going to be 20 percent in a year. We didn’t quite make our goal this year, but I’m not complaining about losing a toe when other people lost their feet.”

The fund was down 1.2 percent for the quarter and 2.6 percent for the year.

One of Mr. Gabelli’s tactics is scooping up acquisition targets. Once a deal is announced, he assesses whether it will close. If he thinks that it will, he buys. That led him to Anheuser-Busch after InBev of Belgium made a bid of $65 a share. Uncertainty about the deal’s prospects stemmed from resistance in Missouri, Anheuser-Busch’s home state. InBev sweetened its offer, and Gabelli ABC pocketed a profit.

Not every deal closes, of course, and the fund can suffer as a result. Mr. Gabelli accumulated shares of Yahoo after Microsoft offered about $45 billion for it. In his view, Yahoo made a mistake in saying no: “Microsoft knocks on the door with an all-cash bid. All they had to do is say, ‘Give us another buck.’ ” Instead, Yahoo spurned its suitor, and its shares have sunk with the market since.

Gabelli ABC zips in and out of many stocks. The fund’s annual turnover ratio is about 200 percent, meaning it holds a stock, on average, for about six months. The typical fund turns about 80 percent of its portfolio a year.

Mr. Gabelli’s trading looks quiet next to the frenzied style of JPMorgan Highbridge Statistical Market Neutral. With a turnover ratio of nearly 400 percent, it effectively flips its entire portfolio four times a year.

Whippet-fast reactions are part of its quantitative strategy. Statistical arbitrageurs like Evan L. Dick, the senior portfolio manager, use computers to spot short-term pricing anomalies and try to exploit them quickly. Sometimes, they are in and out of a stock within a day. In effect, they skitter around trying to grab nickels and dimes, while other investors pray for dollars.

The fund both buys shares in companies and sells them short, which is a way of making money on stock drops.

In 2008, Highbridge managed to deliver positive returns even as the rest of the market dropped. It had a total return of 3.2 percent for the quarter and 10 percent for the year. It had an expense ratio of 1.95 percent.

Managers of quantitative funds typically do not reveal much about their investing formulas, and the Highbridge group is little different in this respect. Mr. Dick and Alain M. Sunier, the portfolio manager, would not say much about exactly where they found values in the fourth quarter, though they were happy to talk about the advantage of computers over humans in buying and shorting stocks.

“A human could’ve had a fight with his wife,” Mr. Dick said. “Humans forget things.”

Computers are hardly infallible, but he said he trusts his machines enough that his mother invests in the fund.
289 2009-01-11 “The shoe is on the other foot,” said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management. Recalling the most serious global financial breakdown before this one, he added: “During the ’97-’98 crisis, Asian companies and banks owed U.S. dollars and not the other way around. Now countries have tremendous foreign reserves and are in a much stronger position.”

Investment advisers and international organizations forecast economic growth to be 6 percent or more this year in China and India and a few percentage points less in Brazil and Russia. In the United States, Japan and Western Europe, the recession is expected to linger for much of the year.

Jonathan Bell, a manager of the Forward Emerging Markets fund, is interested in differences among the BRICs, not just between them and other markets. He expects long-term growth rates and share-price performance to diverge across the BRICs because of differences in the quality of political leadership. In his view, China and Brazil are very well run, Russia is not and India is somewhere in between.

The connection among the four has always been tenuous. Their industrial bases, political systems and overall progress varies, but they are populous countries that have narrowed the development gap with wealthier, more mature ones. Those similarities enabled investment firms to package and sell them as ready-for-prime-time emerging markets.

But not lately. The resilience of the BRICs and other emerging economies has not kept the public from dumping their stocks aggressively. Investment advisers attribute the weakness to a general aversion to risk, which keeps money flowing into assets deemed safe and close to home, like Treasury bonds, and out of anything volatile and far away.

Beyond that, investors in mature economies need the money. Forced selling by hedge funds and others with heavy losses and unwieldy debt loads is also thought to have played a role. The BRIC markets have been hit especially hard because they are dominated by large, actively traded companies that are easy to sell — but they also tend to benefit first in a rebound.

“When confidence globally comes back, it’s the BRICs that will lead the recovery,” predicted Josephine Jiménez, chief investment officer of Victoria 1522 Investments in San Francisco. Confidence is still hard to glimpse, but as the financial crisis plays out, stocks in the spurned BRIC markets are starting to look desirable again to fund managers and strategists. With global conditions still unsettled, however, some prefer to play hard-to-get and not rush into anything.

Simon Hallett, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets fund, became cautious last year, sooner than many of his peers, but low valuations after the “sharp and brutal reversal” are turning him bullish again.

“The risks in the world are in the U.S., U.K. and the fringes of Western Europe,” he said, concurring with Mr. Mobius. By contrast, “investors are starting to get paid to take emerging-market risk. I don’t think the risks have gone up as much as prices have gone down.”

Mr. Hallett says he is interested in “high-quality companies taking their place on the global stage,” and he finds many of them in the BRIC markets. A prime example is Petróleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, the Brazilian energy company that has grown fast enough to enter the major leagues and compete against the likes of Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.

“Petrobras is a very good company that happens to be in an emerging market,” he said. “It’s a world leader, and it’s had a tremendous year in terms of finding assets.”

Petrobras is also a favorite of Ms. Jimenez, who is heavily invested in commodities. Her selections include several mining companies, notably Companhia Vale do Rio Doce known as CVRD, and Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais in Brazil, Polyus Gold in Russia and Zijin Mining and China Molybdenum in China.

Among her other selections are Banco do Brasil and Trisul, a Brazilian property developer.

Ms. Jimenez is steering clear of India, whose stocks she finds expensive, but Mr. Hallett has several holdings there. He praised the country’s leaders for sound economic management during a difficult time, although he wishes that they would upgrade the country’s roads and other infrastructure.

His favorite stocks include the banks HDFC, Icici and Axis, as well as Hindustan Unilever, a large provider of consumer staples.

With so much of the world struggling, Mr. Bell, at the Forward fund, is concentrating on defensive sectors like telecommunications and utilities. His largest holdings include China Mobile, the Russian phone service provider Mobile TeleSystems and Bharti Airtel in India.

“We don’t think things are going to turn around in a V-shaped recovery,” he said.

Mr. Mobius said he was “very positive for markets generally, not just emerging markets,” but he did express some caution.

He said he expects the BRICs to attract new money when investors realize just how cheap these markets are and when it becomes clear that economic stimulus plans are starting to work. While he waits, he prefers defensive plays in consumer industries, like Natura Cosméticos in Brazil and China Green Food, a maker of processed foods.

Another way to emphasize safety, he said, is to own enormous blue chips, companies “that will survive and thrive” through the global crisis. He highlighted China Mobile and a quartet of energy suppliers: PetroChina and Sinopec in China, Lukoil in Russia and, in one more vote of confidence, Petrobras.

ROBERT ARNOTT, the chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment management firm in Los Angeles, says he expects “a fast recovery in emerging markets because there’s more room for growth.” He says he is not sure when it will start, however, so the heavy dependence on exports, especially commodities, in the BRIC economies makes him wary enough to advise avoiding stocks there for now.

A better alternative for him is sovereign and corporate debt. Many issues offer “juicy yields” in the low double digits, he said.

Looking further out, Mr. Arnott becomes more hopeful about BRIC stock markets. He doesn’t recommend them for a casual fling, but he thinks they are ideal for a long-term relationship.

“Investments made today might be regretted one year from now,” he said, “but they won’t be regretted five years from now.”
290 2009-01-11 Investors should also understand that fund company revenue drops when funds shrink, as both of these have lately. If, as Fidelity hopes, new customers trundle in, the investment company stands to collect tens of millions of dollars in additional fees.

For most of 2008, Fidelity watched investors exit the two funds. Mr. Danoff said that he understood why.

“We have not done a very good job with our shareholders’ hard-earned money,” he said. “To say I’m in line with the index” isn’t very impressive, he said.

To enable investors to cash out, Mr. Danoff and Mr. Tillinghast, who was not available for an interview, have had to sell off stocks in a depressed market. New money would counter the outflows and provide them with cash with which to make new bets. But the funds’ girth might hamper their managers’ ability to invest nimbly.

“If I was in a Fidelity-only 401(k) plan, I’d be inclined to buy both of these funds,” said Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar, the fund researcher. “But if these funds were smaller, I’d bet that the returns would’ve been even better.” Other investment companies provide good options that aren’t as elephantine, he pointed out.

Analysts at Morningstar and elsewhere have long argued that letting mutual funds swell handicaps their managers. In theory, great size imposes two constraints. It limits a manager’s investment options because a huge fund cannot, say, buy a meaningful stake in a company with a small number of outstanding shares; even if the manager buys a big chunk, the stake may influence his fund’s returns only negligibly. Likewise, running a huge fund can force a manager to cast about for places to park shareholder money, stretching beyond his best ideas.

Contrafund, with $47.7 billion in assets, held 327 stocks at the end of October. Low-Priced Stock, with $18 billion in assets, had 723.

Looking at the huge number of stocks in the Low-Priced Stock fund, Christopher M. Davis, Morningstar’s Fidelity specialist, said that Mr. Tillinghast “is a talented manager” and that “It’d be interesting to see what he could do with a portfolio of 100 stocks, instead of 700.”

If immensity can hurt performance and thus shareholders, it helps Fidelity, which rakes in money as its funds fatten.

Fidelity, like many fund companies, receives a percentage of the assets in each of its funds to cover costs and, if all goes well, provide a profit. For Contrafund, that levy, called the expense ratio, is 0.89 percent a year, while for Low-Priced Stock, it’s 0.98 percent. When Contrafund held about $80 billion in assets in 2007, its expense ratio would’ve translated into about $700 million a year in revenue. Its current level of assets would generate about $400 million.

“If you’re Fidelity, your fee income has gone down,” said Jonathan M. Reuter, a finance professor at Boston College. “Fidelity is certainly big enough to cover its fixed costs. But maybe it’s having a difficult time earning enough to pay managers what they’re accustomed to being paid.”

Walter C. Donovan, president of Fidelity’s equity division, said that declining revenue was not why Fidelity reopened the funds. “This isn’t a business decision, other than what’s right for the shareholders,” he said. “The market’s down, and we’re all up to our ears in investment opportunities.” Mr. Danoff and Mr. Tillinghast cannot exploit those opportunities without a steady flow of cash.

Over the span of their nearly 20-year careers, Mr. Danoff and Mr. Tillinghast have profitably invested their shareholders’ money. As managers of their funds, they’ve outperformed their benchmark indexes and done so while taking less risk and spending less of their shareholders’ money than the typical manager in their sectors.

In his 18 years leading Contrafund, Mr. Danoff has beaten the S.& P. 500 by an annualized average of about four percentage points, while, in his 19 years at Low-Priced Stock, Mr. Tillinghast has outperformed the Russell 2000 by an annualized average of five percentage points. Their funds also have lower-than-average expense ratios and betas than those of their peers. (Beta measures whether a fund’s returns zigzag more or less than those of its index.)

POINTING to his long-term record, Mr. Danoff played down concerns that fund size might hamstring his stock-picking. He noted that he had managed to make profitable bets even when the fund was nearly twice as large.

Besides, heft can help, he said.

“It gives us access to thought leaders,” he said. “I don’t want to pester my management teams, but periodically, if I’m the biggest shareholder or could be the biggest shareholder, I’ll say, ‘Let’s spend a half-hour and talk about the strategic direction.’ ”

Lately, Mr. Danoff has favored investments in companies that are plenty big themselves. Among his top holdings at the end of October were such giants as Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.

He said that he bought into these companies partly because they were well situated to endure the recession. They have sturdy brands, business models and balance sheets, he said.

And their shares, for the most part, have not soared in the last decade, even as their earnings have grown. As a result, their price-to-earnings ratios have fallen, making them comparatively cheap.

Mr. Danoff also said he saw blue-chip stocks as “the ultimate anti-hedge-fund investment.” Over the last decade, hedge funds have crowded into the market like circus clowns stuffing themselves into a Volkswagen Beetle. Mr. Danoff thus decided to hunt in places that they were ignoring. That led him to the dependable, if dull, blue chips.

“The hedge funds tend to be short term in their investing, so I started thinking, ‘If the hedge fund thing is going to bubble over and I don’t want to be like a hedge fund, where aren’t they looking?’ ”
291 2009-01-11 At least Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have the decency just to leave the scene.

From Gaza to the unemployment figures to the $10.6 trillion debt, things keep spiraling while W. keeps fiddling. Just as when he was in the National Guard and didn’t bother to show up, now, as the scabrous consequences of his missteps shake the economy and the world, he doesn’t bother to show up. He’s checked out — spending his time on more than a dozen exit interviews that do nothing to change his image as a president who was over his head and under Cheney’s spell.

Asked by People magazine what moments from the last eight years he revisited most often, W. talked passionately about the pitch he threw out at the World Series in 2001: “I never felt that anxious any other time during my presidency, curiously enough.”

Asked by Fred Barnes and Bill Kristol of The Weekly Standard if he had made progress in some areas for which he hasn’t gotten credit, the president put trying to privatize Social Security at the top of his list. It’s frightening to think where a lot of people would be now if that effort had succeeded.

After he leaves office, W. wants to go on more bike rides, because biking through Katrina was not enough. He wants to write a memoir, even though the offers are not pouring in as they did for Laura. And he wants to encourage debate at his presidential library on “big ideas.”

The vamoosing Vice has no apologies about turning America into a country that tortured; indeed, he denies it ever happened. “Torture,” he told Barnes, “that word gets thrown around with great abandon.”

He’s going back to Casper, Wyo., and said he’s giving “serious thought” to writing a book, so he can continue his extremist makeover. The only thing he can do now is shoot a big lie across the bow and see if it lands.

Cheney’s theory of executive “unitary” power and pre-emptive war and frightening the world was a theory of Constitutional thuggishness.

Asked last week by Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in one of his exit interviews to name the “biggest mis-impression” people had about him, Cheney replied with a laugh, “That I’m actually a warm, lovable sort.”

He went on to seriously assert that his image as “a private, Darth Vader-type personality” has been “pretty dramatically overdone.”

“I think we made good decisions,” he told Knoller, adding with even grander delusion, “I think we knew what we were doing.”

He protested “the notion that somehow I was pulling strings or making presidential-level decisions. I was not. There was never any question about who was in charge. It was George Bush. And that’s the way we operated. This whole notion that somehow I exceeded my authority here, was usurping his authority, is simply not true. It’s an urban legend, never happened.”

The fact that Cheney is now putting all the blame for all the messes squarely on W. shows once more how the bureaucratic master outmaneuvers his younger partner.

Even on his way out, Vice is still on top.
292 2009-01-11 But the readers I am hearing from are not ready to accept that notion. Supporters of Israel want coverage that stresses the terror caused by Hamas rockets fired ever deeper into Israeli territory, and are offended at so many pictures of Palestinian casualties. Supporters of the Palestinians want the coverage to focus on the suffering caused by Israel’s bombs and missiles, and on the economic sanctions and border closings that isolated Gaza before the latest fighting began.

The intensity of the criticism is no surprise. “It isn’t just a war,” said Nicholas Lemann, dean of the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University. “It’s a media war. Public opinions outside the region are very important, and they’re shaped by the press coverage.”

Because of its international reach and influence, The Times comes in for particularly close scrutiny. Abramson said she thinks no other topic of news generates as much feedback. Photographs, the content and play of articles, headlines, captions and even individual word choices are examined and challenged.

Early in the conflict, Ethan Bronner, the Jerusalem bureau chief, wrote a deep and incisive front-page news analysis that contained a single slip. When he said Israel would need “another peace treaty” with Hamas — he told me he had meant cease-fire — Roger Gerber of Scarsdale, N.Y., saw it as a sign of bias or “at best sloppy reporting” because Hamas rejects the existence of Israel and would never sign a peace treaty.

Bert Distelburger of New City, N.Y., said he suspected that a front-page picture last Monday of a dead Palestinian girl being carried on a stretcher in a Gaza City hospital was a faked “propaganda photo” because, “A doctor does not examine a person face down.” Patrick Witty, the photo editor who recommended the picture, showed me how he blew it up on a large computer screen and scanned it carefully for any signs of digital doctoring. “This is a real photograph,” he said. He also showed me obvious propaganda photos from both sides that he said he would never put in the newspaper — posed pictures of Palestinians looking at bodies or Israel’s prime minister visiting a smiling soldier in a hospital.

Witty and his colleagues are frustrated because Israel has barred journalists from entering Gaza, and although The Times has two photographers in the region ready to go, it must rely on pictures taken by Palestinian photographers. “When I can’t have my own person there, I have to question every picture that comes in — to an obsessive degree,” he said. Last summer, Witty unmasked as a fake a photo of an Iranian missile test that ran on many other front pages.

Stephen Weil of Washington said he understood that Israel’s bombings had killed hundreds more Palestinians than the number of Israelis killed by Hamas rockets. Yet photos on the newspaper’s Web site “tell a different story: for every Palestinian victim, an Israeli one is shown.” He urged me to do a photo count, and said that if The Times was trying to suggest that the suffering on each side was roughly equal, “it is a lie.”

My assistant, Michael McElroy, did such a count, from the start of the latest fighting through Friday, and found that online and in the newspaper, there were almost three photos from Gaza showing the impact of the war for every photo from Israel. There were 28 photos, some quite graphic, of dead and wounded Palestinians, five of Israelis. Such a ratio offends supporters of Israel, who argue that Hamas uses civilians as human shields and that the pictures inflame people against Israel.

But most of the destruction is in Gaza, and news photographs are not about blame but about showing what happened. Demolished buildings and dead bodies provide dramatic images; fear in Israel is more difficult to capture with a camera. “There’s nothing fair in war photography,” Witty said. “It’s tragic.”

Some readers questioned the accuracy of casualty numbers in The Times. “Casualty figures are always incorrect,” Shipler said, “especially the day you report them.”

The newspaper ran a correction last Monday, saying that for the first three days of the conflict, it should have said more than 60 civilians were killed, not “some 60.” United Nations officials had counted 62 dead women and children but had no count of civilian men, because it is hard to tell them from Hamas fighters who do not wear uniforms.

When Israeli bombs killed dozens at a United Nations school on Tuesday, it was too dangerous for the newspaper’s Palestinian stringer, Taghreed El-Khodary, who has worked for The Times for seven years, to go to the scene. She went instead to a hospital, where an official told her that 40 were killed, including 10 children and 5 women. The head surgeon and an ambulance driver said 45 were dead. United Nations officials, who were not on the scene, said 30 were killed. The Times emphasized the hospital’s count of 40.

Ian Fisher, the deputy foreign editor who helps direct daily coverage, said, “Like all human things, we are not perfect, but the attention that goes into this is tremendous.”

Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think The Times, largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded.
293 2009-01-11 Christine Benz, director of personal financial planning at Morningstar in Chicago, said certain fund categories — notably those that specialize in Asian and developing markets — were more vulnerable than others.

Morningstar does not have a compendium of funds that made high distributions to shareholders in 2008, Ms. Benz said. But some examples that have attracted notice include Oppenheimer Developing Markets, which paid out $8.88 a share on Dec. 8, more than 35 percent of its net asset value just before the distribution. (The fund, by the way, was down 48 percent for 2008.) Others with high distributions included Vanguard Precious Metals and Mining, at almost 18 percent of net asset value; Tweedy Browne Global Value, about 15 percent; Tweedy Browne Value, 13 percent; and Dodge & Cox International, more than 10 percent.

If your nest egg has shrunk, you probably won’t be happy to pay capital gains tax. But at least taxes on capital gains and most dividends — those labeled “qualified” on the 1099 — are now low by historical standards. For most shareholders, the rate is 15 percent, and some will escape the tax entirely.

On 2008 returns, taxpayers in the regular 10 percent and 15 percent brackets will not be subject to capital gains taxes. That means taxable income for single filers below $32,550 and for married couples filing jointly below $65,100.

Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and accountant who is principal federal tax analyst for CCH, which publishes books and software for tax professionals, said that some people in the upper brackets would also escape the tax on their mutual fund dividends because they had capital losses on sales of other securities that would offset the fund income. Capital gains and losses are netted on tax returns, and if the result is a net capital loss, up to $3,000 can be taken against ordinary income and the rest carried forward to future years.

Mutual funds that have a net loss are not allowed to pass the loss on to shareholders as they do gains. But they, too, can carry the loss forward to offset gains in future years. Therein lies an opportunity, Mr. Stolper said.

“An embedded loss means shareholders can get a free ride back up the hill,” he said. “Everyone has this fear of buying now. There is a lot of cash, a lot of negativism. This is typically when markets begin to climb back up.”

Ms. Benz said two fund categories that “have big losses on their books” were large-cap growth funds and technology funds, some of which never recovered fully from their losses of 2000-2.

One lesson investors can learn from 2008, she said, is to consider holding income-producing funds in tax-deferred retirement accounts. The income can grow tax-free until retirement, when distributions are taxed at regular rates. For taxable accounts, she suggested index funds — which typically have very low turnover and thus aren’t likely to spring gains surprises — or tax-managed funds. The Vanguard 500 Index fund had turnover of less than 5 percent last year.

She cautioned, however, that buyers should consider “investment merits ahead of taxes,” adding that taxes “are a wild card,” especially now with an economic crisis and an incoming administration and Congress.

If you sold fund holdings last year, Mr. Luscombe said, you should check past records of reinvested dividends. That could cut the tax liability because reinvested dividends become part of the cost basis. Say you initially invested $5,000 and over the years received 1099s reporting dividends and capital gains totaling $1,500, and, of course, paid the tax. Then, last year, you sold the holding for $8,000. The taxable gain is $1,500, not $3,000, so at least you won’t be taxed twice on the fund’s gains.
294 2009-01-11 “If we hope to understand not just the strengths but also the weaknesses of free markets,” he writes, “we need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of human nature.” Once we do, he says, we can make better decisions on personal and public policy levels.

For example, it would be good to raise the savings rate. But consider the way most companies offer retirement plans: The “default option” is that the employees don’t contribute. The only way they can, even if the company offers some kind of match, is for them to say “sign me up.”

But if automatic enrollment were the default option, more employees would probably participate. Such a change, Dr. Ubel argues, doesn’t limit people’s freedom, because they can still opt out.

He is not claiming this idea as his own. As he points out, behavioral economists and others have suggested this approach. He cites it as a way to deal with the fact that people can make irrational economic decisions.

As many behavioral economists do, Dr. Ubel favors “mandating better information about financial transactions,” like adjustable-rate mortgages and rent-to-own deals that often end up costing much more than if the item was bought outright. But much of the time, he seems to favor direct government intervention in the marketplace.

Here is just one example: “The preponderance of scientific evidence now points to direct causal relationships between calorie-dense food and obesity,“ he writes, adding later that “the government has a right to step in and see whether it can change the situation.”

He goes on at great length to analyze the question of obesity, and its prevention. While this is an important subject, the discussion seems excessive in a book about personal finance.

MORE irksome from time to time are statements of apparent surprise at how the real world works — that advertisers, for example, would deliberately place ads where they think they’ll find the most receptive audiences. (The book singles out nightly news programs as examples: because they tend to attract older viewers, they may be filled with pharmaceutical ads.)

“Does this feel Big Brother-y to you?,” it asks. “Are you bothered that some advertisers know so much about your aches and pains? Would it bother you to know that you’ve also been typecast according to where you live, what magazines you subscribe to, or any other number of habits you have?”

Though it is a rhetorical question, many people would answer no. Still, the book contains some intriguing information. Dr. Ubel writes that advertisers have hired neuroscientists who say that “as people age, they base an increasing proportion of their decisions on emotion rather than strict deliberation.” As a result, ads aimed at older adults often have a large emotional component.

Dr. Ubel’s fundamental premise seems sound: We are not as rational as we would like to believe, especially in economic matters. That is something to ponder before making an important investment decision.
295 2009-01-11 And yet, as the economic storm worsens, money funds still seem the refuge of choice. According to the Investment Company Institute, the nation’s money funds held $3.83 trillion on New Year’s Eve — about $22 billion more than at Christmas, $110 billion more than at Thanksgiving and $712 billion more than at the end of 2007.

Those billions could have flowed into F.D.I.C.-insured bank accounts. “But for decades, people have had the choice between higher yield and absolute safety, and they’ve chosen yield,” said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks the mutual fund industry.

That doesn’t mean the money fund industry will not be changed by the fallout from the money fund crisis of 2008.

For one thing, there is still a lot to learn about what actually happened with the Reserve Primary fund, the $64 billion money market fund that was the flagship for the Reserve Fund complex.

Last week, a federal judge in Minneapolis approved a request that a “special master” be appointed to monitor how the complex’s managers use fund assets as the Primary fund and its sister funds are slowly liquidated. The request was made by lawyers for Ameriprise Financial, whose customers had about $1.2 billion in the fund. The judge also allowed Ameriprise to make public some previously confidential portions of its lawsuit supporting its allegation that some big investors were tipped about the crisis a day early.

The Reserve Fund has attributed its troubles to a run triggered by fears about its $785 million stake in commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15.

On that same day, the newly public lawsuit passages assert, Reserve Fund staff members told certain investors that writing off the Lehman stake would put the Primary fund at risk of breaking the buck and warned them that the fund was experiencing “above normal” levels of redemptions — disclosures that, in effect, prompted the run that the fund blames for its problems.

The Reserve Fund has called these complaints “outrageous” allegations that will be proved groundless in court.

The fund complex, meanwhile, has been notified that the enforcement staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission is recommending a formal investigation of its affiliated management company; Bruce R. Bent, the management company’s president; and Mr. Bent’s two sons, also company executives.

Besides any fresh lessons that an investigation may produce, the money fund industry is also facing the uncertain ramifications of the Treasury’s new insurance program, adopted in the wake of the Reserve Fund panic.

The temporary program is more limited than it sounds: It insures only assets that were in a money fund on Sept. 19 and have been left there, not assets that have been invested since then.

Nevertheless, if the program is expanded or becomes permanent — as many in the industry expect — the Treasury will most likely attach a few additional strings.

“If the Treasury is going to insure these funds, bank-style, we are likely to end up with bank-style regulations,” said Matthew P. Fink, a former fund industry executive and author of “The Rise of Mutual Funds: An Insider’s View” (Oxford University Press, 2008).

And the money fund industry will be one target of the broader regulatory reform effort that has been promised by the incoming Obama administration. Regulators may consider requiring greater portfolio diversification and minimum levels of cash as a buffer against a panic, according to Mr. Fink.

BUT such steps would complicate the already challenging arithmetic confronting money fund sponsors. Most are already waiving fees so they can offer any yield at all, given today’s very low interest rates; a higher cash requirement would push yields even lower, while more regulation could push up sponsor expenses.

Of course, fee waivers can be a boon to retail investors for as long as they last. But only strong fund sponsors can afford to operate their money funds as “loss leaders” over the long run — especially when they must also be prepared to step in and prevent those funds from breaking the buck in a turbulent market.

Indeed, most fund analysts agreed that the clearest consumer lesson of the money fund crisis of 2008 is that the future of the industry belongs to the strong — those sponsors that investors can credibly expect to step in and save them from the fate that overtook shareholders in the Reserve Fund.
296 2009-01-11 Hence, by the time the size of the iceberg became apparent, the Titanic was hard put to stop.

True, it seemed crystal-clear that abandoning Lehman to bankruptcy would be a disaster, but only to those who wanted to see. I don’t really know what Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, were thinking.

And, earlier in 2008 and back to late 2007, why didn’t the Fed and the Treasury cut rates and start a much bigger stimulus package much sooner? Well, the price signals that would have told them of the recessionary problems were obscured by speculative bubbles in energy and other commodities. These bubbles were so extreme that they fooled policy makers into thinking that the problem was inflation, not recession.

This does not make the Bush administration’s policymakers fools. Many people believed that we were in a genuine energy supply crisis that pointed toward a worldwide inflationary crisis. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson did not see the bubble, but then federal officials never see bubbles. This just shows that they’re human. They cannot be expected to be geniuses, and even geniuses are often wrong, and in the face of crisis, merely ordinary people.

Right now, I think it’s obvious that the next step for policy is the issuance of guarantees for banks that make loans. This should get credit flowing again, almost instantly. For some reason, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson don’t see it, but maybe they are right and I am wrong. We are all just people. Humans are very small when compared with the complexity and difficulty of life.

I do not expect that things will be substantially different for the new team under Barack Obama. Mr. Obama has the reputation of being terribly smart, and he obviously ran a great campaign. But his policy prescriptions as senator were quite ordinary, and his statements as presidential candidate and now as president-elect have seemed to me just catch phrases and standard Democratic pablum. His career as a law professor was not noteworthy for scholarship. He may seem more impressive upon inauguration, but I respectfully suggest that the pickings are slim so far.

The top officials in the White House economic policy hut are smart folks with fine credentials. But Paul H. O’Neill, President Bush’s first Treasury secretary, was as smart a man as I ever met, and he hardly lasted two years.

Going back a few more years, the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson teams were supposed to be “the best and the brightest.” They undoubtedly contained some brilliant people — who led us into disaster in Cuba and Vietnam. Similarly, I think that Mr. Kissinger was and is an astonishing, off-the-charts genius. He accomplished basically zero in Vietnam.

SO let me make it even clearer: The Obama people could be wonderful, smart people, an order of magnitude above what I saw at the Ford cabinet meetings. Obviously, many people believe that they are.

But they are just human beings, albeit in some cases human beings with glowing résumés. I do not see the supermen and superwomen. They do not have the gift of foresight. They have never been in a situation like this, at least not exactly. There is simply no good reason to believe they will get it right except by trial and error, turning the tumblers until the safe eventually opens. The problems we face now are so large that they humble the average and the above average and even the very much above average.

High-level bureaucrats, like high-level professors or doctors or investment bankers or baseball pitchers, are just people, whether serving with Bush 43 or Barack Obama or anyone else. I can vividly recall leaving those long-ago cabinet meetings and saying to myself as I walked across West Executive Avenue, “Put not your trust in princes.” It’s a proverb for a good reason — then, now, and always.
297 2009-01-11 “We’ve had eight years of an administration that turned a blind eye to corporate criminals,” said Terry Collingsworth, a Washington lawyer who is suing Chiquita over the Colombian protection money and is facing Mr. Holder in the case. “We need someone with his level of experience and cachet to clean up the Justice Department. Yet I do have a concern and I sure hope that he doesn’t carry over his corporate defense practice into his approach to the job and how he handles these types of cases.”

When the National Football League was facing a legal and public-relations disaster in 2007 over a dogfighting scandal involving the Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, it turned to Mr. Holder to help navigate the maelstrom and represent the league. The pharmaceutical giant Merck tapped him as its lawyer in a Medicaid overbilling case that ended in a $671 million civil settlement. And Rod R. Blagojevich, the now-impeached governor of Illinois, picked him, albeit briefly, to investigate for the state a controversy over a casino development and its possible ties to organized crime.

Already, Mr. Holder’s brief association with Mr. Blagojevich has drawn scrutiny from Republicans, who are waging a more spirited campaign against Mr. Holder’s nomination than many had anticipated. Until now, most of the scrutiny has focused on controversies during the nominee’s time as deputy attorney general at the end of the Clinton administration, particularly his role in the pardon of the fugitive financier Marc Rich.

In responding to written questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder made no mention of a 2004 announcement in which Mr. Blagojevich introduced him as a “special investigator” under a $300,000 contract with the state.

The appointment fell through, and Mr. Holder’s aides said his failure to mention the episode had been an oversight that was soon corrected. But some Republicans said they were troubled by the omission. Three Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee — Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, John Cornyn of Texas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa — sent the governor’s office a Freedom of Information Act request last week seeking documents on the aborted agreement.

Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sharply questioned Mr. Holder’s character and political independence in a speech last week on the Senate floor. Mr. Specter told reporters Friday that he wanted to see more information about Mr. Holder’s private practice, to assess whether he was up to the job of attorney general.

“Covington & Burling is a very prominent, prestigious firm,” Mr. Specter said. He said Republican investigators had not yet found anything untoward in Mr. Holder’s private practice, but added, “We’re looking through all his records.”

Mr. Holder’s record in private practice has received much less attention than his earlier work at the Justice Department, particularly his role in Mr. Clinton’s 2001 pardon of Mr. Rich. Mr. Holder is being scrutinized as well over his role in other Clinton-era controversies, including clemency granted by Mr. Clinton for 16 members of a militant Puerto Rican nationalist group and the Justice Department’s refusal to appoint an independent counsel to examine possible campaign finance abuses by the White House.

With Senate Republicans challenging Mr. Holder’s nomination, a string of well-known lawyers from both parties have come to his defense with testimonials in recent days, citing both his record at the Justice Department and in private practice as evidence of his strong qualifications.

In a letter of support to the Judiciary Committee last Wednesday Louis J. Freeh, who was director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation before becoming general counsel of MBNA America Bank, told of hiring Mr. Holder as the trial counsel on a complicated case that he won for Mr. Freeh’s company.

“I could have engaged any lawyer in America to represent our bank,” Mr. Freeh wrote. He said, “I chose Eric” because of “his excellent legal skills, complete integrity, sense of fairness, courage and, most importantly, my confidence that he would provide me with his independent judgment without fear or favor.”

Those skills have paid off handsomely for Mr. Holder and his law firm. He has done extensive pro bono work for crime victims, inmates who say they were wrongly convicted and others, and he is well known in Washington for his charitable work and deep roots in the community. At the same time, he has entered a group of A-list lawyers in the capital who reportedly earn $800 to $1,000 an hour. (Covington & Burling would not comment on Mr. Holder’s fees. An aide to Mr. Holder would not give the figure either, but said it had never been as high as $1,000.)

Last spring, when Mr. Holder was traveling extensively to campaign for Mr. Obama, he joked to The American Lawyer magazine, “I hope the management committee is going to be real understanding when they see my billable hours this year.”

Not that the absences appear to have hurt his bottom line. In his disclosure statement to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder said he expected to earn more than $2.5 million from the law firm in 2008, an increase from $2.15 million the year before. That total includes an expected separation payment of $1.3 million to be paid upon his resignation from the firm, if he is confirmed as attorney general.

Kathryn King, a spokeswoman for Covington & Burling, said the separation agreement was a result of a standard procedure at the firm. “The methodology has been established and applied by our firm for many years and was in place well before the parties knew that Mr. Holder was being considered for a federal appointment,” she said.

For all his recent prominence as a lawyer in private practice, friends say that Mr. Holder has been itching to return to the place where he first made his name.

“Eric truly loved his days at the Department of Justice,” said Billy Martin, a prominent Washington lawyer and longtime friend of Mr. Holder’s who worked opposite him as Mr. Vick’s defense lawyer in the dogfighting prosecution. “He was very good at being a public servant in a position of leadership, and I think he missed it.”
298 2009-01-11 “I’ve always wanted to walk into a hotel, sit at a piano and play ‘Piano Man,’ ” he said. Why? “I saw Billy Joel when I was in college at N.C. State, and it always seemed like a good song.”

He may follow up with “Hey Jude” if you put a five-spot in his cup. “The way I’m playing now,” he said, “there’d be no money in the cup.”

Like some former coaches who take television jobs — Bill Parcells and Jimmy Johnson come to mind — Cowher knows that his weekly presence ignites speculation about his future with every firing of a coach.

“By sitting and talking about it, I bring a lot of it on myself,” he said. “I don’t want to say I’m retired and will never come back.”

For now, weekdays in Raleigh and weekends in New York are enough for him.

His youngest daughter, Lindsay, is in high school in Raleigh; his middle daughter, Lauren, is at Princeton; and his eldest, Meagan, is teaching in Manhattan.

“I look forward to having dinner with her Saturday nights in New York,” he said.

All three daughters play basketball (Lauren and Meagan were Princeton teammates), following the lineage of their mother, the former Kaye Young, who played in college and professionally.

“I’ve probably watched more basketball games than anything,” he said. “I’ve coached them on mind-set, not technique. I tell them I like to walk into a gym in the third quarter and not be able to tell by their expressions if they’ve made or missed their last 12 shots.”

Cowher doesn’t teach his brand of saliva-fueled sideline emotion. “My middle one was a lot like me, not good at hiding her emotions,” he said. “The younger one is getting better.”

Very little of Cowher’s sideline personality is in evidence at CBS. He is not in charge (try telling Shannon Sharpe what to do), smiles a lot and contributes his insights.

“He’s fit in because he reads people and reads situations very well,” said James Brown, the host of “The NFL Today” and former host of “Fox NFL Sunday.”

He said that when he watches Cowher debate Sharpe, Boomer Esiason or Dan Marino: “You can see that protruding jaw. He purses his lips, he furrows his eyebrows and makes his point. It’s him saying, ‘Coaches coach and players play.’ ”

Brown recalled Cowher’s response this season when Sharpe said the N.F.L. should have made players aware that a diuretic not listed as an ingredient in a weight-loss supplement was a banned substance. Five players suspended for violating the league’s drug policy were subsequently cleared to play by a federal judge.

“Bill had a letter that he read to players at the start of each season that says no weight-loss pill, no diuretic is to be taken because you’re responsible for what you put in your body,” he said. “His message was: what part of that don’t you understand?”

Cowher says that his shift to network TV has been eased by the caliber of those he works with. But he is still adjusting to speculating about teams and coaches — “the sensationalizing every week.”

He added: “I think, ‘Let’s not overreact this week.’ But it’s our job.”

And it will be his for at least another season. (At least for now.)

As for Eric Mangini, the former Jets coach who got the Browns’ job, Cowher said he was not surprised.

“It’s hard to say he’s not qualified,” he said. “He had a winning record two of his three years. But it all depends on what you’re looking for. Every owner has the right to do what’s best for his organization. Just because the dynamics don’t work in one place doesn’t mean they won’t work elsewhere.”
299 2009-01-11 Rickey Henderson, who was the stylish leadoff man for the Oakland Athletics when they won the 1989 World Series, is expected to be elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Mark McGwire, who was a bruising power hitter on that team, is not expected to come close to election in his third year on the ballot.

Since McGwire’s career was clouded by the suspicion of steroid use, he has received scant support. McGwire, whose 583 homers are eighth on the career list, received 23.5 percent of the vote in 2007 and 23.6 last year. Players, eligible for 15 years if they receive at least 5 percent of the vote, need 75 percent for election.

In a poll of 97 members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America who vote for the Hall, only 18 said they had voted for McGwire. That is 19 percent. Of those who voted for McGwire, three changed their votes from last year. More than 500 writers usually vote in the election.

“I think his numbers merit inclusion and, if he cheated, so did many others in his era,” said Lowell Cohn of The Santa Rosa Press Democrat, one voter who changed his opinion on McGwire. “I felt he had been punished long enough.”

But many other voters cited either McGwire’s refusal to answer questions about his possible steroid use at a Congressional hearing in 2005 or the surge in his home run totals later in his career as reasons not to reward him.

“I believe he was largely a one-dimensional player,” Sean McAdam of The Boston Herald said. “And there is overwhelming evidence that his power was achieved, at least partially, through artificial and illegal enhancement.”
300 2009-01-11 At 6 feet 5 inches and 241 pounds, Roethlisberger is better able to withstand blows than the stringy sorts, but he has sometimes seemed less nimble when he scrambles out of the pocket — a hallmark of his playing style — than he was earlier in his career. He is far from fragile, though. Even as he has absorbed the sack barrage in the last three seasons, he has missed only two starts — and one of them came after an appendectomy less than a week before the 2006 season opener.

Although Roethlisberger said he passed a battery of concussion tests, and he and Steelers coaches said he was fine in practice all week, experts in brain trauma say that each concussion a person sustains — this was at least Roethlisberger’s third in two and a half years — makes him susceptible to more. For a quarterback who is hit as often as Roethlisberger is, more injuries of all kinds seem inevitable. It is a Faustian bargain Roethlisberger and the Steelers are willing to make for now.

“I think that’s part of the job,” the offensive coordinator Bruce Arians said. “The job description is you’re going to get hit back there some. Hopefully not to the head. He’s a scrambler; he’s a riverboat gambler. You’re never going to take that away from him; that’s what makes him great. With that come more hits than a normal quarterback is going to take. He’ll take more hits than Peyton Manning because Peyton will just throw it away. He’ll go out and make a play. Sometimes, you get sacked on that. But there’s a lot of big plays on film from that, also.”

The Steelers have needed each of those big plays this season. Counter to a burnished team image that dovetails nicely with the gritty, honest-day’s-work reputation of their hometown, the Steelers became increasingly one-dimensional this season, the passing game given pre-eminence as the running game, especially the power run, struggled.

The franchise that gave the N.F.L. Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier will never be called a finesse team. But with the lead back, Willie Parker, missing five games with a knee injury, the rookie Rashard Mendenhall lost for the season with a shoulder fracture after only four games and the offensive line losing two starters to injury (and guard Alan Faneca to the Jets in the off-season), rushes accounted for only 45.3 percent of the Steelers’ offensive plays this season. That ranked them 13th in the N.F.L., according to Stats LLC, and is down from 51.1 percent last season (ranked third) and 57.2 percent (first) in 2005, their most recent Super Bowl championship season.

Since 1992, the former coach Bill Cowher’s first year, the Steelers have been in the top five of rushing attempts for all but four seasons: 1998 (8th), 2003 (tied for 16th), 2006 (tied for 14th) and 2008 (9th). The Steelers were .500 or below in three of those seasons. The exception is 2008. And this year, the Steelers averaged just 105.6 yards rushing, the lowest average of any previous playoff team in Steelers history.

That has led to a minor flurry of complaining about play calling. Parker expressed dissatisfaction last month with the style of runs being called — he and much of the maligned offensive line want more classic I-formation with a fullback, which had success in the finale against the Cleveland Browns.

Coach Mike Tomlin pointedly noted that Parker, known as Fast Willie, was not complaining last season when he led the league in rushing until being injured in the Steelers’ next-to-last game. The Steelers do most of their running without a fullback, and when they played the Chargers this season, they ran largely out of the spread formation. Parker had 115 yards in that game.

“If I was on the defensive side of the ball, I wouldn’t respect the running game because we haven’t been that successful this year,” Parker said. “We’ve never been viewed as one-dimensional — we have, but it was a running team. If you look at it now, we’re not a running team no more. Are we a passing team? You could say we’re a passing team.”

That creates a vicious cycle for Roethlisberger: a defense that is unafraid of the running game can rush the quarterback with abandon, and the lack of a significant running threat means the play-action fake, the bedrock of nearly every productive passing attack, is not effective. The fallout: the teams that gave the Steelers trouble this season had outstanding pass rushes. The Eagles sacked Roethlisberger eight times, the Giants and the Tennessee Titans five each. Even Indianapolis, not exactly a defensive powerhouse, got Roethlisberger twice. Those are the four teams the Steelers lost to in the regular season.

When the Steelers and the Chargers played in November (the Steelers won, 11-10), Roethlisberger was sacked four times. The Steelers’ offense dominated, anyway, but they did not score touchdowns.

The Chargers have turned up their pressure since that game under the defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, who took over midway through the season. San Diego forced Manning out of his comfort zone in the wild-card game last weekend. To keep Roethlisberger upright — for this game, this postseason and his career — the Steelers know they must at least try to establish their traditional playoff look: 3 yards and a cloud of snow.

“For us to be known as a physical team, it’s hard to be a physical team when you’re passing all the time,” receiver Hines Ward said. “We can’t be 40-20 pass-to-run ratio.”

The answer for the Steelers may be standing next to Roethlisberger on the field Sunday after all. Bettis is taking part in the coin toss.
301 2009-01-11 An article on Nov. 2 about renovations to the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach misspelled the given name of an artist who was a frequent guest as a girl and had her wedding there. She is Michele Oka Doner, not Michelle. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Tuesday.
302 2009-01-11 SHORTLY after graduating from Hunter College in 1978, the photographer Barbara Mensch moved from SoHo to the top floor of a walk-up on Water Street near the South Street Seaport. The charming but decrepit 19th-century brick building was shared by several artists, who sought the low rents and the seaport’s industrial grittiness. Ms. Mensch and her neighbors now own the building, which they have renovated.

From windows facing west and from the roof of her loft, Ms. Mensch has views of the Brooklyn Bridge’s span, the Manhattan entrance ramp and the Municipal Building. Recently added northern windows have created a special feature: Just outside looms the bridge’s massive limestone anchorage, its gargantuan scale dwarfing the viewer within.

Although Ms. Mensch is most widely known for her photographs of the old Fulton Fish Market, to which two books have been devoted, she has also photographed the Brooklyn Bridge for nearly 30 years. As Mont Sainte-Victoire was for Cezanne, the bridge has been a constant in her life and her art. Capturing the bridge at all times of the day and the seasons of the year, she has learned as much about the river and the weather as about the bridge’s structure.

Recently, Ms. Mensch has become fascinated with the bridge’s history, especially the story of Emily Roebling, right, the remarkable wife of the bridge’s engineer, Washington Roebling. When her husband fell ill with “the bends,” Emily masked the extent of his illness, acting as his surrogate for 14 years.

In his 1972 work “The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge,” the historian David McCullough writes: “By and by it was common gossip that hers was the real mind behind the great work and that this the most monumental engineering triumph of the age was actually the doing of a woman, which as a general proposition was taken in some quarters to be both preposterous and calamitous. In truth, she had by then a thorough grasp of the engineering involved.”

Despite opposition, she won over her critics, and at the 1883 opening, Emily Roebling took the first ceremonial ride across the bridge with President Chester Arthur.
303 2009-01-11 Real estate sales agents have bought condos to live in, or to rent to tenants — or both — at four company properties, including 700 Grove in Jersey City, and Harborside Lofts at Hudson Tea, and Maxwell Place on the Hudson in Hoboken, Mr. Jogodnik said. Many of those same people have also brokered sales and are continuing to market condos in buildings where they own property, he added.

Dean Geibel, the principal of Metro Homes, said he had witnessed the same broker “hat trick,” so to speak, at several of the buildings his company has developed in the waterfront district.

Arlene Wittig, an agent at Re/Max Competitive Edge, signed a contract two years ago for a 600-square-foot studio at Gulls Cove, a Metro Homes complex in Jersey City, intending to “flip” the property. (The site — beside a light rail station and a ferry stop, and four blocks from a PATH train — seemed “ideal for turning a profit,” she said.) Then, last year when the market began sliding in the suburbs of Somerset County, where Ms. Wittig owned a 2,300-square-foot town house, she decided to sell the house and move into her studio instead.

“I love it,” said Ms. Wittig, 53, who now commutes to her office in Somerset County. “I can walk to fine dining, shopping, take the light rail to Hoboken, or wherever. It’s like being in Manhattan, without the added expense.

“That’s what I tell my customers,” she said, “and that’s what I believe.” She said she had sold four other units at Gulls Cove since moving in.

David Najjar, who owns his own agency, Realty Executives, is another buyer/seller at Gulls Cove, which offers units ranging in price from the low $200,000s to more than $1 million. Mr. Najjar, 31, and his partner live in a two-bedroom corner unit with a view that takes in the Midtown Manhattan skyline as well as the Statue of Liberty.

“What I tell people is that there is real value here,” Mr. Najjar said. “Because this neighborhood is still developing, and there are still a few empty lots around, and more amenities to come, the prices are great. With mortgage rates low, there is great value in buying right now.”

By contrast, Kaja Bolton, an agent at Liberty Realty, bought at the top end of the market, in March 2008, becoming the first resident to close at Harborside Lofts, a 116-unit building. In addition to a 1,950-square-foot penthouse with two bedrooms and a den, she and her fiancé, Steven Broomhead, paid $200,000 for one of several private rooftop terraces with full-panorama views.

“I would definitely tell people I live here when they came to look at the building,” which is now 95 percent sold, Ms. Bolton said. “I’ve sold four or five condos here now.”

Originally from Norway, Ms. Bolton says she finds Hoboken a sort of European oasis in New Jersey: a small, densely populated and walkable city. She thinks that the opening of the W Hotel this spring will bring more excitement, and that the mile-square city will weather the prevailing economic and real estate troubles quite well.

“Things are O.K. now,” she said last week. “I have customers coming in on Monday, and out of seven properties I have to show them, in the range up to $700,000, four have offers on them already.”

Ms. Visaggio, the Coldwell Banker agent, says she has sold units at each of the Toll buildings, as well as several of the Metro Homes buildings.

She has also bought condos for herself in two different Toll buildings — first, Maxwell Place in Hoboken, and then 700 Grove in Jersey City. The Maxwell Place purchase, in 2006, was in the complex’s first building, which sold out rapidly, said Ms. Visaggio, a 47-year-old Hoboken native. She was able to “make a lot of money when I sold it, and decided to move to 700 Grove.”

Because this second condo is inland and next to a PATH train stop — as opposed to right on the riverfront, like Maxwell Place — “I got a lot more for the money,” she said. Ms. Visaggio’s two-bedroom two-bath condo has 1,373 square feet. “Space is important,” she said, “because I have two puppies, and I have a large family and like to have them over.”

She says she owns another Hoboken condo that has lost about $100,000 in value since the recession hit. Rental rates, however, have stayed strong, she said, so the investment is not a losing proposition as of yet.

David Paris, a Century 21 agent in Hoboken, has just invested in a two-bedroom condo in Jersey City that he plans to rent out. Mr. Paris, 38, recently decamped from Hoboken, moving with his wife and two young children to a single-family house in Morris County.

As an investment, he bought a 1,200-square-foot apartment at Matzel & Mumford’s Crescent Court, a 54-unit midrise building with enclosed parking that is under construction.

Mr. Paris bought in the mid-$400,000s, with a 5 percent down payment, and estimates that the unit will rent for about $2,500 a month.

“I’m hoping the market recovers by September,” he said, “but even if it is not back by then, even if I take a small loss each month for a while, I feel this is a really good investment in a well-constructed, midprice-range building.”
304 2009-01-11 “The T.S.A. is looking at addressing the risks associated with general aviation,” Michal Morgan, general manager of business operations at the agency, said in an interview before the meeting. “That includes the use of aircraft as a weapon or as a conveyance mechanism for dangerous materials.”

The proposal would require operators of private planes to conduct fingerprint-based background checks on pilots, cross-check passenger names against a government watch list, establish a security program, submit to regular audits and limit what items may be taken on an aircraft.

“God bless them, but what happened on 9/11 didn’t happen on general aviation airplanes,” said Jeff Lee, a corporate pilot and president of the Westchester Aviation Association here. He was one of 60 people who spoke against the proposal at the meeting.

Paul Anderson, a corporate pilot who directs aviation operations for a large Connecticut company, said: “We’ve seen in Iraq that a Toyota packed with explosives can be an effective terror tool; the question is what will be the likelihood of that happening? This proposal does not truly enhance the nation’s security.”

As one private-plane operator after another predicted that the burdens and costs of the new security provisions would force many small and midsize businesses to give up their airplanes, they quoted Benjamin Franklin and Winston Churchill, perhaps because, as Ms. Pezza put it, “It’s so ridiculous, we’re speechless.”

Hearing the comments of operators who are now exempt but would come under T.S.A. jurisdiction is part of the rulemaking process. Mrs. Morgan said the agency would take into account the unique nature of general aviation and that many private airplane operators already had programs to safeguard their planes and passengers.

“Much of what is being proposed is based on best practices implemented and adopted by this community,” she said.

To increase its regulatory control from 650 airplane operators to 10,000 over the next two years, the T.S.A. plans to outsource parts of the oversight. From smaller companies like Hapco to large ones like United Technologies, every affected plane operator would have to pay for security audits and matching of passenger names against the federal terrorist watch list. Eighty-three percent of the cost, estimated at $196 million a year, would come from the airplane owners, the T.S.A. projected.

At Hapco, officials are accustomed to flying in their private plane; they have had one kind or another for 45 years. What the jet saved executives in time was worth the cost of operating and maintaining it, said Jamey Friedman, a principal with Hapco. But as Ms. Pezza ticked off on her fingers the new services the company would pay for under the proposed rule, she wondered if the balance would change.

“It’s going to cost me $10,000-plus to get some guy to put this program together and X amount of dollars for F.B.I. fingerprint checks,” she said. “Another X for the security audit, X for each passenger to be approved by the T.S.A. for each flight. It’s just too much.”
305 2009-01-11 A technology article last Sunday about a General Motors research effort in the 1980s to fuel cars with coal misstated the name of the program director. He was Albert H. Bell III, not Alfred H. Bell.
306 2009-01-11 Mr. Beckerman, 78, explained that the roots of animation lay in newspaper comics and vaudeville, where pioneers like Winsor McCay and Mr. Blackton got their starts. “Animation spun out of Broadway culture, beginning as vaudeville acts and expanding on the screens of storefront nickelodeons and movie palaces,” he said. “This exhibit emphasizes animation as a product of New York’s exuberance.”

“It All Started Here” brings together an array of historical facts, technical explanations and animation memorabilia. “The toughest part was deciding what to include,” said Mr. Sedelmaier, 52, “to satisfy the time-to-get-a-life animation freaks like us, but still keep it broad and clear enough to interest the general public.”

Visitors to the Arts Exchange will be greeted by four-foot standees of Mighty Mouse and Popeye. Inside, a 15-by-20-foot reproduction of McCay’s Gertie the Dinosaur towers up to the mezzanine balcony, and polychromatic murals of familiar cartoon personalities adorn the walls. A Popeye lamp circa 1938 and a 1960s Mighty Mouse radio represent merchandising based on various characters. An oversized list displays the nearly 550 animation companies that have called New York home since 1906.

There is original artwork from each stage of the animation process, including character sketches, cels and storyboards from a selection of films. “We’ve got artwork of Betty Boop when she still had little dog ears, signed by the animator Grim Natwick, who helped create her,” said Mr. Sedelmaier. “We have a 60-year-old scene of Popeye from ‘Lumberjack and Jill’ that was never used, and a pose test, pencil test and final footage from a Baby Huey cartoon.”

DVDs playing on flat screens and conventional monitors throughout the exhibition focus on different periods of animation. One presents snippets of characters from old silent cartoons; a second shows more contemporary independent animation by New York-based filmmakers. Another plays a compilation of animated television commercials, including Marky Maypo shouting, “I want my Maypo!” and Bert and Harry Piel (voiced by the comic duo Bob and Ray) promoting Piels beer, both from the 1950s.

Equipment on view ranges from an antique Mutascope and a Moviola from the 1950s once owned by the animator Preston Blair to a desktop computer used in the making of Disney’s 1982 feature “Tron.” There are also manual sound effects makers, a Fleischer Studios animation disk from 1936, and a planning board (used to assist in the checking process before the animation artwork was filmed) designed by John Oxberry, of New Rochelle, for Jack Zander, the Pound Ridge resident who animated Jerry of “Tom and Jerry.”

Besides being informative, Mr. Sedelmaier believes “It All Started Here” will provoke an emotional response.

“We’re dealing with some pretty personal stuff here,” he said. “We’re giving people the chance to see ‘friends’ from their childhood in the context of the world that created them. That, and the fact that it all happened so close to home, should elicit some powerful reactions.”

According to Mara Rupners, director of communications at the Westchester Arts Council, “It All Started Here” sits apart from other exhibitions at the Arts Exchange. “For one thing, it includes more multimedia than what we usually do,” she said. “And it’s more of a historical exposition than a straight art exhibit. It’s a family-friendly learning experience.”

Like the recent “All Fired Up,” “It All Started Here” reaches beyond the Arts Exchange to involve other Arts Council affiliates. There will be special screening events at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville and the Pelham Picture House in Pelham.

“This is an example of our commitment to coordinating programming among our partners and getting people to work together,” Ms. Rupners said.

The Burns will present four programs, beginning on Thursday with a compilation of early silent animations and a live re-enactment of the stage show that accompanied “Gertie the Dinosaur” in 1914. The Picture House will offer two moderated events, the first exploring animated television commercials, and the second covering independently produced animation.

There will also be workshops and discussions at the Arts Exchange. This month the Arts Council initiates ArtSpeak, a monthly series of hourlong lunchtime programs for adults, with a session led by Mr. Sedelmaier and Mr. Beckerman on Jan. 23. Next month, children can make a zoetrope and learn about sound effects in two Saturday workshops.

“So much of animation is anonymous,” Mr. Sedelmaier said. “We’re hoping to answer questions about where these cartoons came from and how they were made — or better yet, to enlighten people to ask those questions and discover the answers themselves.”

“It All Started Here” runs Jan. 20 to Feb. 28 at the Arts Exchange, 31 Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains. Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission is free. Opening reception Jan. 17, 5 to 8 p.m. Information: westarts.com or (914) 428-4220, Ext. 223. Related programs include the following:

307 2009-01-11 Many involved with sled dog racing said they knew of no other female long-distance competitive musher from Connecticut besides Ms. Lesinski. There are a few who run in shorter recreational races and one other woman, Becki Tucker of Voluntown, who this season will race in mid-distance competitions of between 30 and 60 miles, but whose plans to begin competing in 100-mile races were delayed when she suffered a head injury.

“It is unusual to have a team from that far south,” said Tenley Bennett, coordinator of the Eagle Lake 100-mile race scheduled in northern Maine for Jan. 24.

The International Sled Dog Racing Association, based in Minnesota, estimates there are 3,000 dog drivers in North America. About 40 percent of mushers in the United States live in Alaska, the association said.

Eagle Lake will be Ms. Lesinski’s first race this season. Hers is the only Connecticut team registered.

In 2008, she finished 11th in a 16-team field in the race, a spot Ms. Bennett called respectable, especially because Ms. Lesinski competed primarily against teams from Canada and northern New England, where racing is more common, the training season longer and most racers have larger packs of dogs and race only their fastest ones.

Ms. Lesinski got involved in the sport after watching a sled dog race while on a ski trip in Vermont. Since then, she and her husband have dedicated their lives to their dogs and the sport, spending about $15,000 a year. Neither she, a substitute physical education teacher when she’s not racing, nor her husband, a retired athletic director, had any history of working with dogs.

In her first four race seasons, she competed in 16 races, gradually building to the competitions of at least 100 miles. This season, she said, she intends to race in two 100-mile races, along with the 60-mile segment of the Can-Am Crown International in Fort Kent, Me., in February.

Competitive mushing is far from a lucrative undertaking. Ms. Bennett in Maine, a former sled dog racer, said she discovered that even if she won every race she entered, the prize money still would pay for only the care of her 20 dogs.

That is one reason Ms. Lesinski is especially excited about the Eagle Lake race — a $10,000 total purse there means every team that finishes will bring home at least some money. That will help defray some of the cost of racing, she said.
308 2009-01-11 Several of our veteran museums are doing by undoing: loosening up the rigid values and temple-of-art models that shaped them, and replacing these with a new “people’s museum” model, unsacred in atmosphere, fluid in values, with complicated answers to the question of what museums are.

The results of this thinking range from great to work-in-progress gauche to soul-selling bad. The goal in most cases is the same: to get visitors through the door. People bring museums to life. Lively museums feel young and hip, which brings rewards.

At least that’s the idea. Time will tell. For now, as these older museums give it a whirl, they are setting examples that younger or better cushioned institutions should study. If they don’t, and the economy continues its descent, they’ll be out there too.

The most striking change in institutional fortunes has been witnessed at the Detroit Institute of Arts, partly because the museum’s form and ambitions were so grand. Founded in 1888, and later housed in a majestic Beaux-Arts building two miles from the city’s downtown area, it was both a civic and cultural monument, “dedicated by the people of Detroit to the knowledge and enjoyment of art,” according to the words carved over its front door.

The collection is extraordinary, with renowned pictures by Jan van Eyck, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Giovanni Bellini; one of the country’s premier troves of 19th-century American painting; and — the modernist pièce de résistance — Diego Rivera’s “Detroit Industry” murals, a proletarian fantasy paid for in 1934 by a heavy-hitting local patron, the industrialist Edsel Ford.

Comparable largess is all but nonexistent in Detroit today. Wealthy industrialists have faded from the scene. The Michigan state government gives almost no money to the institute, the city even less. In 1997 Detroit built the Museum of African-American History across the street from the institute, its spanking newness in sharp contrast to its older, crumbling neighbor.

Graham W. J. Beal, who arrived as director that year, has done much to stop the decline, largely — and this is where other museums should pay attention — through the use of material at hand. In 2007, to attract the city’s black majority and woo back white suburbanites, the museum unveiled a top-to-bottom rethinking of all the permanent galleries, with strategic shifts in emphasis.

The museum’s very fine African collection, developed by the curator Michael Kan, was placed upfront, near a main entrance, where it offers a cool yet absorbing introduction to the institute’s imperious interior. A gallery for African-American art, including Detroit artists, was added upstairs: it’s an important gesture, although something should have been done to make it look commanding rather than dutiful.

Other parts of the collection have been reinstalled by interpretive theme, with wall texts reflecting the influence of a new art history that approaches objects as vehicles of social values. The texts are bland, but the idea is sound: this is the kind of context the Metropolitan Museum in New York should be offering in, among other places, its Greek and Roman galleries. Finally, child-friendly multimedia aids were added to deliver on the museum’s twin promise of knowledge and pleasure.

Pure-art hard-liners will spurn all of this. Accessibility, they will say, means stripping the museum of the lofty mystique that is its strength. And giving prominence to what was once called ethnic art means perpetuating old cultural imbalances yet in reverse, in the interest of political correctness, the thinking goes.

I disagree. I’d be glad if the museum added even more interpretive stuff but made it sharper and more challenging. If this causes problems, it can always be changed, but what’s the problem with causing problems? African art upfront? There’s no art I’d rather see anywhere, so why not there? As for political correctness, I’m over the whole idea, especially when the expression is used to demean sincere belief.

Whatever its shortcomings, the reinstallation proves that a major museum can recharge itself from within, from its own holdings. And this kind of recharging could well become the only viable route for museums. That said, it is no guarantee of security. Mr. Beal will soon announce yet another rethought version of the Detroit Institute: a “shrunken” museum of radically reduced resources in a city in financial free fall.

The Newark Museum, which will celebrate its centenary in April, was also the pride of a prosperous town hit later by economic reversals and population shifts, culminating in an explosion of racial violence in 1967. Yet it differs from the Detroit Institute in certain essentials: it is smaller, multidisciplinary and “a people’s museum” by design.

It began as two galleries on the top floor of the city’s public library, one marked “art” and the other “science.” The museum’s founder, John Cotton Dana, a librarian, made clear that his purpose was not to create “a temple in a park,” but a center for learning, with art being one of several sources of edification. When the museum’s current building opened in 1926, it equally accommodated longtime citizens and new immigrants, who could study art but also learn a trade in shows that alternated between fine art and industrial design.

The museum’s multidisciplinary origins are still with it: along with art, it has natural history displays, a mini-zoo and a planetarium. Its early multicultural bias is evident too. African art bought by Dana at the turn of the century is on view. So is a cache of Tibetan art — the largest ensemble in the West — gathered by a local missionary, Albert L. Shelton, and displayed on a Tibetan Buddhist altar consecrated by the Dalai Lama.

The question of how to present religious material in the secular context of a museum has been much debated in the last few decades, after identity politics prompted a reassertion of the authenticity of certain spiritual traditions, and scholars insisted that performance has often constituted the meaning of ritual art.

The matter may seem purely academic for anyone committed to the Modernist divide between art and religion. But a belief in the active agency of sacred things has many implications. It is fire that burns beneath bitter repatriation disputes, and in places like India or Africa it shapes the very concept of what a museum is and does.

The Museum for African Art is one of the few museums in Manhattan to regularly and seriously bring secular and sacred together in a gallery. But Newark has been doing so for years — with Christian art too — thus placing itself in the vanguard.

The museum is lucky in drawing substantial support from its home city and state, allowing visitors to pay what they wish. It certainly wouldn’t make much if it depended for support on foot traffic from New York. I am always amazed to learn of art professionals who have never been to the museum, a mere half-hour PATH ride from Midtown Manhattan. Not that it needs New York’s confirmation. Few museums feel both as wide-ranging and as self-sufficient.

Of all the veteran institutions banking on alternative status, the Brooklyn Museum’s current and insistent version of otherness is the most controversial, although it does have a long history.

In the mid-19th-century Brooklyn was a flourishing independent city, the third-largest in the country, with ambitions to build the No. 1 museum. Taking Manhattan as the team to beat, it began erecting a gigantic multiplex affair.

But no sooner had the first step of the plan been completed — the Beaux-Arts building the museum occupies now — than Brooklyn was merged into New York City, and the museum defaulted to No. 2, a position it has kept as its audiences changed from haute bourgeois to working-class and immigrant poor.

Despite a magnificent collection and a record of estimable shows, the museum is still routinely dismissed as a perpetual, and failed, Met aspirant, an identity it often seemed to accept as attendance declined. Not so many years ago its cavernous entrance hall was one of the emptiest big spaces in the city.

In 1997 Arnold L. Lehman, a Brooklyn native, became director and said, “Enough, already.” The focus of the Brooklyn Museum, he reasoned, should be Brooklyn, with its multiethnic population and new crop of upwardly mobile young professionals. In so many words he told disapproving Manhattan critics to kiss off. Not that he turned his back on Manhattan. He rented expensive imported shows like “Sensation,” in 1999, and last season’s Takashi Murakami survey, fare almost guaranteed to lure traffic across the Brooklyn Bridge.

Such shows put the museum, for better or worse (often worse), in the news. They also ratcheted up its youth presence, as, in different ways, did two other exhibitions, one of commercial hip-hop artifacts and another of “Star Wars” paraphernalia.

Both of these shows were panned, but what was the significant difference between them and the Guggenheim’s much-praised motorcycle extravaganza, or the average design showcase at the Museum of Modern Art? The main distinction, I’d say, was class: high class (Guggenheim, MoMA) versus lower class (Brooklyn).

For me those Brooklyn shows fell under the category of material culture, a legitimate candidate for art museum display though not necessarily approachable by traditional formalist critical standards. I saw the hip-hop show twice. It was packed. Being a greenhorn, I asked my fellow viewers questions — who’s this, what’s that — and learned a lot. It was a great museum experience.

Not everything Mr. Lehman programs has been so clearly box-office directed. The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for feminist art isn’t. It mostly draws a select audience with defined interests. But its presence for the museum is invaluable. It distinguished this institution from any other: you can only find this there, and this is something that reliable numbers of people will always want to find. A Manhattan museum should have thought of a feminist center decades ago.

The big failure under Mr. Lehman’s stewardship so far has been the treatment of the museum’s incomparable collection. Major permanent collection displays — Egypt, Africa, Art of the Americas — are badly designed. It’s not a question of too many labels; I’m into labels. They just look cheesy. A change in the design team is long overdue.

It’s too bad the museum recently had to transfer its priceless costume collection to the Met, but just as well. It’s still in the city, and the Met has the resources to care for it. The big problem is that many of Brooklyn’s holdings remain unseen — and, chances are, undocumented. Here the Detroit Institute and the Newark Museum are examples to follow, but so is some work that Brooklyn itself has done in the past.

In the mid-1990s, when money was scarce, a team of staff curators went into the vaults, pulled out the museum’s long unseen collection of Spanish colonial material and created a cross-departmental show, “Converging Cultures: Art and Identity in Spanish America.” People who saw it were stunned.

Who knew that this fabulous stuff — textiles, portrait painting, furniture, glowing religious icons, high art and low art, elitist and popular — had been there in the dark all that time? Clearly, everyone said, this museum is sitting on a gold mine. It is. Mr. Lehman should start digging now.

Sooner rather than later, given the state of the economy, he may not have any choice. For our older, underprivileged, underloved museums, this is the silver lining of hard times. These institutions have the art, the real thing. They have the space; if not much. With luck they have scholarly expertise and curatorial imagination, which they should value like gold. Now is the time, if ever there was one, to look within and bring forth what’s there. People will come. And bigger, richer, less adventurous museums will follow.

331 2009-01-12 The gowns were strapless and bejeweled, but the mood was business casual: some of the weepier gushes of gratitude at Sunday night’s Golden Globes ceremony were aimed at makeup and wardrobe people. In both her acceptance speeches, Kate Winslet also mistily thanked her agents.

It could have been the writers’ strike that put television and movies on hold for months and turned last year’s Golden Globes into a glorified press conference. Or maybe it was the effects of recession looming ahead. But a ceremony usually known for high spirits (and lots of wine and spirits) had a brisk, workmanlike feel. Behind the sparkle and self-congratulation, there was a whiff of insecurity.

At least one star in the room was texting at the dinner table (perhaps checking for a call-back), and the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which sponsors the event and selects the winners, promised he wouldn’t subject the room to “one of those boring president’s speeches.” Emma Thompson, who presented an award alongside Dustin Hoffman, joked that as older actors, they would give studios “a hefty discount” to get more work.

The few stars who gave long acceptance speeches seemed to realize, midway, that those kinds of histrionics were reserved for Academy Awards, and that they might have dented their chances at Oscars. Sally Hawkins said apologetically, “I should have shut up a long time ago,” but then kept on talking.

Tom Wilkinson, who won the best supporting actor award for a mini-series or television movie for HBO’s “John Adams,” tried to set them straight, noting that thank-yous, however heartfelt, “get a bit dreary.” He only mentioned a few associates, including “Frank, whose last name I’ve forgotten.”

Steven Spielberg was one of the few who did not begin his remarks by thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, perhaps because he was one of the few in the room secure enough to dispense with that ritual of show business obeisance. Colin Farrell almost forgot, then hastily added his thanks at the end of his remarks, rather nervously: “That would have been bad,” he said. And only Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais dared joke about it. Ms. Fey said she had loved the organization ever since she was a little girl, saying, “I had all the Hollywood Foreign Press action figures.”
332 2009-01-12 After the presidential election, the filed a lawsuit that could drive a stake through the heart of the campaign finance system. It challenges the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold law’s ban on “soft money” contributions. If the suit succeeds, it will seriously damage democracy by allowing a virtually unlimited amount of corporate and other special-interest money to flood into politics.

There is no denying that the campaign finance system is badly broken. It suffered even more harm when became the first major-party nominee to refuse public financing and the spending limits that come with it. One of Mr. Obama’s top priorities should be fixing the system’s flaws, including the core problem that it does not provide enough money for a strong presidential campaign in modern times. But it will be impossible to fix the system if the R.N.C. prevails in court.

The Republicans are trying to remove the restrictions that McCain-Feingold puts on contributions to national political parties. Now, the parties are allowed to accept no more than $28,500 a year from individuals, and nothing at all from corporations or labor unions. The R.N.C. wants to strip away these restrictions so it can accept unlimited amounts of “soft,” or unrestricted, money from corporations and rich people.

The suit, which is before a special three-judge panel in , claims that the limits are unconstitutional. The R.N.C. says it uses much of the money it raises for activities not related to federal elections, such as redistricting, grass-roots organizing and issue advertising. It argues that the First Amendment prohibits limiting contributions for these purposes.

The problem with this argument is that the has already rejected it. In 2003, in McConnell v. F.E.C., the justices upheld the precise provisions the Republicans are now challenging.

In its ruling, the court emphasized that it does not matter what the money is spent on. Because the national parties have close ties to federal elected officials, the court said, large donations to the parties inject special-interest money into the federal government and have a corrupting effect on politics.
333 2009-01-12 “No one is helping me,” said Mr. Ponce, who was faxing his résumé to hotels and restaurants from an employment office in Downtown Brooklyn on Thursday. “I’ve applied for public assistance, but I don’t think I’m going to get it.”

Extended benefits are also about to expire over the next week or two in Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania and at least 20 other states, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates for lower-wage workers. No official estimates exist for how many people would lose their benefits in those states, but experts said it was likely to exceed 200,000.

In Philadelphia, Tony Green, 38, said he was due to collect the last of his checks by Jan. 25. His twice-extended benefits have amounted to $470 a month after taxes, forcing him to give up a rented house in the Fox Chase section of the city and move with his two teenage children to a place in North Philadelphia that he described as “drug-infested and dirty.”

Mr. Green said he had sold his car and borrowed more than $10,000, mostly on “maxed-out” credit cards. He has been taking construction jobs to supplement his benefits, but said he feared the extra income would dry up as the economy contracted.

“People are really tapped out,” he said.

Unemployment insurance, a federal system that is administered by the states, was intended as a stopgap, half-year source of relief, not a long-term source of income. But last year, as the economy slumped and the unemployment rate rose, Congress approved two extensions of jobless benefits, one for 13 weeks and the second for up to 20 additional weeks. The national unemployment rate rose again in December to 7.2 percent, a 16-year high, the government reported Friday.

However, New York and about two dozen other states have not yet qualified for the full 20 weeks of the second extension, because their jobless rates have been lower than other states. The latest extension was limited to seven weeks in states where the unemployment rate had not averaged at least 6 percent for three consecutive months. New Jersey and Connecticut have already qualified for the full extension.

New York’s unemployment rate has been rising in recent months, surpassing 6 percent in November. But the rate will have to jump again this month for workers in the state to qualify for the full 13-week extension.

The formula for triggering the availability of more emergency benefits has left New York’s commissioner of labor, M. Patricia Smith, in the odd position of rooting for a higher jobless rate.

“We’ve seen over the last year a large jump in the number of people who do exhaust benefits because, as the economic climate gets worse and worse, it becomes harder to become re-employed,” Ms. Smith said Thursday.

The program providing the additional 33 weeks of benefits is scheduled to expire March 31, meaning no extended benefits would be available after that date. But Congress is considering legislation supported by President-elect Barack Obama that would continue the program until the end of the year.

Each month, about 18,000 state residents use the last of their regular benefits, and most of them immediately seek to start collecting extended benefits, according to the Labor Department. About 116,000 New Yorkers are collecting extended benefits now, including those who will receive their final checks this week.

Unemployed workers in New York not only receive fewer weeks of extended benefits than jobless residents of neighboring states, they also receive smaller checks. The maximum weekly benefit in New York is $405, a limit that has not changed in more than eight years because state lawmakers have been unwilling to raise the payroll tax that finances unemployment benefits. In New Jersey, the top rate for unemployment benefits is $584; Connecticut’s is $576.

Paulette Walker, 45, said she had depleted almost all of her savings since she lost a job as an employee-benefits representative for Cigna Healthcare, where she had worked for 17 years. She has been renting a room from her ex-husband’s family in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, but fears she will not be able to afford even those humble lodgings if her $331 weekly benefits run out in three weeks, as scheduled.

“I worked all my life and there’s nothing wrong with me,” Ms. Walker, a Jamaican immigrant, said, as she broke down crying. “I’m living with my ex-in-laws because I don’t have any family here. When my benefits finish, I don’t know how I’m going to pay for that room.”

Emanuel During, 55, whose extended benefits expired last week, said he had resorted to substituting a bottle of soda for a meal at dinnertime. Mr. During, who lives alone in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and does not qualify for food stamps, said he had been searching for work since he was dismissed a year ago by the school-bus company he drove for.

“I feel hopeless. I’ve been applying for all different types of jobs,” said Mr. During, who said he applied for more than 20 jobs in the last few months and was considering training to drive a tractor-trailer. “What I was doing, there’s nothing. It’s dead, it’s dead.”

Running out of unemployment benefits “can become a real breaking point for families,” said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. “You’ll see a big increase in poverty among these families. Some people will have to go on welfare. It’s very destabilizing. In less than a year, they’ve gone from working class to poor.”

The first step for many people whose benefits lapse is to take “survival jobs,” low-paying positions that do not make use of their skills, Mr. Stettner said. Several New Yorkers who were at or near the end of their unemployment benefits said that they might have to resort to menial jobs rather than continue pursuing the sort of work they were trained for.

Eric Mio, 40, who has been working sporadically as a driver for a moving company, said his benefits would run out in a few weeks. He is receiving assistance from the state to study to become an electrician, but he said he might have to settle for a lower-paying job in the meantime.

“I’ve been lucky, things come through,” said Mr. Mio, who lives alone in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx. “It’s just enough. I’m keeping a roof over my head and food in my belly. But I don’t go out anymore.”

If he can no longer collect unemployment, he said, “I guess I’ll go to the supermarket and bag groceries.”
334 2009-01-12 It remains unclear if there is a need to rush to release the money, or if the Obama transition team is just seeking to avoid what could become a major headache. The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would oppose disbursing the money because there was no justification for doing so now.

“I think until there is a demonstrated need in our economy and a plan to address that need, I think it would be irresponsible of Congress to release the additional money,” Mr. Boehner said.

Mr. Bush’s request is expected to be preceded by a forceful effort by Mr. Obama’s team to persuade lawmakers that the new administration will make better use of the bailout money, including new home foreclosure prevention efforts and restrictions on banks that get aid.

Lawrence H. Summers, who will be Mr. Obama’s top economic adviser at the White House, began to make that case on Sunday in a meeting with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill. Though the meeting focused primarily on tax provisions of the economic recovery plan, Mr. Summers also argued that the new administration should have the bailout money on hand.

“They need it,” Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said after the meeting. “Larry Summers made a very strong argument for why it’s important and critical to the overall recovery, and that’s an argument most of us understand.”

But Mr. Kerry said lawmakers were awaiting assurances from Mr. Obama and his aides on how the money would be used. “How about a legitimate accountability structure for what’s going to happen going forward?” he said. “And also there is a lot of interest up here in finding out what happened to the 350 that has already been spent.”

The White House has indicated that Mr. Bush will formally request the money if Mr. Obama asks him to do so.

“There have been discussions between the administration and the transition team on how to proceed should the president-elect determine that he would like President Bush to notify Congress on his behalf of the intent to use the remaining $350 billion so that it will be available early in the new administration,” the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said on Friday. “No final decisions have been made.”

Officials said Mr. Bush was also willing to help try to persuade Congress to approve the money.

Even with the muscle of both the president and the president-elect, however, there is no guarantee Congress will release the money. Under the bailout law, the House and Senate can vote to block the funds, though Mr. Bush presumably would veto their disapproval.

Many lawmakers who say they may be willing to release the money are still demanding tough new conditions on its use, and Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill last week that would impose them. An aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would vote to approve Mr. Frank’s bill this week.

Mr. Frank’s bill would require the new administration to develop a plan by March 15 to use at least $40 billion of the $350 billion to prevent home foreclosures.

The bill also seeks to require greater transparency and accountability, including quarterly reports from financial institutions that receive help to document how the bailout money is being used. It would also impose tougher limits on executive pay.

Some Congressional leaders said there did not seem to be enough time to approve new legislation if the bailout money is to be in place by the time Mr. Obama takes office. Others said Congress bore some responsibility for rushing the bailout legislation in the fall and not including sufficient safeguards.

Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said there had been discussion of a formal letter to be written by Mr. Obama or his aides to Congress describing their plan for the additional $350 billion and promising safeguards. But he acknowledged that without new legislation there would be nothing to guarantee that those plans would be followed.

Lawmakers are angry about many aspects of the bailout, which they intended for the government purchase of troubled assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities, but instead has been used to recapitalize banks and even prop up failing Detroit automakers.

An oversight board recently issued a scathing report saying the Treasury had failed to track the money adequately.

Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama’s nominee for Treasury secretary, has been working to restructure the bailout program. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said lawmakers would need assurances of the new administration’s plans.

“It has got to be in writing,” Mr. Conrad said.

Mr. Dodd said, “The Obama administration wants to rebrand this process; they realize it has been terribly mismanaged.” He added, “But they also make the strong point that they need these resources to do that.”

Senate Democrats met with Mr. Summers, primarily about the larger economic recovery package, after a rare Sunday session, in which they voted to take up consideration of a package of public lands bills.

It was the first weekend of the new Congress, and Senate Democratic leaders insisted on a Sunday vote to signal that with their expanded majority they had less patience for efforts by Republicans to block their agenda.

Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, had sought to stall the public lands package because he said it included billions of dollars in wasteful spending. In the end, the Senate voted 66 to 12 to take up the bill.

The meeting with Mr. Summers was the second between Senate Democrats and the Obama team about the details of the recovery package. At a meeting on Thursday, several senators criticized some of the tax provisions in the plan and said they wanted a greater focus on job creation.

After the meeting, several senators praised Mr. Summers and said their concerns were being addressed.
335 2009-01-12 The F.B.I. feels comfortable enough with the technology to give BlackBerrys to its employees, although it does not allow agents to transmit classified information over them. The National Security Agency, which is responsible for evaluating device security, said last week that nobody was available to discuss whether it had approved the use of BlackBerrys to send classified military information.

But Mr. Obama would be an extraordinarily juicy target for hackers, spies and other snoops who could try to exploit any kind of error made in configuring the device or the White House BlackBerry server to read Mr. Obama’s e-mail.

Bruce Schneier, an expert on encryption and security, does not believe that the security systems at R.I.M. — or at any other company — are completely safe, because of the inherent limitations of the humans who design and use them. “If the BlackBerry was completely secure, it would be the first time in the history of mankind,” Mr. Schneier said.

Then there’s the question of whether Mr. Obama’s BlackBerry could give away his location — perhaps to people trying to harm him. Every mobile phone continuously contacts the nearby towers in its wireless network when it is turned on, so that calls and data can be routed to the phone.

It is technically possible that someone with access to a cellphone company’s systems could use those contacts to roughly track Mr. Obama’s movements, although this would not be easy.

Of course presidents, with their large entourages, do not move about with much secrecy anyway. The biggest security vulnerability of the BlackBerry — and of any technology, for that matter — may be the people who use and administer it.

Mr. Obama is unlikely to leave his BlackBerry in a taxi or choose “Michelle” as his password. (And even if he lost the device, it could be remotely shut down and erased.) But with so much interest in the president-elect and his communications, privacy invaders would be poised to capitalize on any security slip.

The president-elect’s next set of BlackBerry naysayers are the pesky lawyers, who worry that Mr. Obama’s impromptu thumb-tapped conversations could become subject to legal battles.

Lawmakers, historians and open government groups routinely request all presidential communications under federal laws like the Freedom of Information Act. Under the 1978 Presidential Records Act, administrations are required to turn over their communications to public archivists, who make them public starting five years after the end of a president’s final term.

The Bush administration made a novel effort to avoid disclosure by using Republican National Committee e-mail accounts for some of its communications, which a judge in Washington recently called an “apparently flagrant violation of the Presidential Records Act.”

Since Richard Nixon and his infamous tapes, all presidents have argued for their right to withhold some governmental communication under the mantle of executive privilege, and have resisted disclosure of their personal and political correspondence.

But these privacy claims can be hotly disputed, and judges may decide them on a message-by-message basis.

“In this day of inevitable investigations, any time you have written documentation of what the president is saying on any particular subject, then in that investigation, these records may be requested and could be obtained,” said Elizabeth A. McNamara, a lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine in New York. “Then you’ve got the president in the thick of it.”

All this bodes rather poorly for the president-elect’s continued relationship with his BlackBerry, but perhaps that is not so bad. After all, do we really want the leader of the free world taking time off from the problems of climate change and economic collapse to manage his spam, or play a quick game of BrickBreaker?

Then there is the fashion concern. Mr. Obama is known to sport his BlackBerry in a holster on his belt, which to many is the sartorial equivalent of wearing socks with sandals. Ridding the president of the phone could avoid legitimizing that look.

The BlackBerry no doubt endears Mr. Obama to one element of his core constituency: hard-working, tech-obsessed professionals whose fingers are painfully cramped from trying to type on small keys. In a sense, then, the BlackBerry is no different from the accessories that other presidents used to help them relate to their political base, like Ronald Reagan’s cowboy hats and jeans.

But those fashion statements seem less risky than a BlackBerry; it’s harder to hack pants.
336 2009-01-12 BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  “Slumdog Millionaire,” Kate Winslet, HBO and its “John Adams” mini-series and NBC’s comedy juggernaut, “30 Rock,” were the big winners Sunday night at the 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards here.

“Slumdog Millionaire” won best dramatic picture, an honor that informally makes the film the little-movie-that-could of this year’s award season. Danny Boyle won the award for directing the uplifting tale, presented partly in Hindi, which also picked up awards for best screenplay and score. Best comedy was Woody Allen’s “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.”

Ms. Winslet won not only best actress in a drama for “Revolutionary Road,” a film directed by her husband, Sam Mendes, but also best supporting actress for “The Reader,” only the third time in Globes history that a person has won two acting awards in the same year.

“Is this really happening?” an emotional Ms. Winslet said in accepting her second award, pledging true love for her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio.

Mickey Rourke, making a stunning comeback after seeing his acting career all but disappear, was named best actor in a drama for “The Wrestler,” about an over-the-hill athlete. “Several years ago, I was almost out of this business,” he said. Bruce Springsteen won for best original song for his theme song to “The Wrestler.”

Hollywood put aside a dismal economy and the threat of an actors’ strike to focus on the awards, an important stop on the road to the Oscars but one that is as much about putting on a show and putting away some Champagne as it is about building awards consensus. The stars who drive the industry certainly seemed ready to celebrate. The room laughed easily, applauded lustily and then trotted off to a menu of parties at the Beverly Hilton.

While the Globes did their best to keep grimmer realities at bay, there was a flash of reality in the victory of “Waltz With Bashir” for best foreign film. In an oblique reference to the current Israeli invasion in Gaza, its director, Ari Folman, dedicated the award to the eight babies born to crew members during the production and said he hoped that when the children grew up, they would see the film as “an ancient video game that has nothing to do with their life whatsoever.”

In the early awards, Sally Hawkins was named best actress in a comedy or musical film for her role as a relentlessly upbeat schoolteacher in Mike Leigh’s “Happy-Go-Lucky.” In perhaps the evening’s biggest surprise, Colin Farrell took the best actor in a comedy award for playing a hit man with a soft heart in “In Bruges.”

The association had nominated a wide range of movies, with no one film dominating as in years past. The leading entries were “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and “Frost/Nixon,” both nominated for five awards, including best dramatic picture. “Doubt” also received five nominations but did not get a best-picture nod.

None of those three films took home an award. Notably, the awards went to small films and not more expensive movies like “Mamma Mia!”

Ms. Winslet had suggested on the red carpet on the way in that she believed she had very little chance of winning supporting actress, but less than half an hour later she was standing onstage reading a lengthy acceptance speech that singled out her fellow nominees, her agents, her family and even the hair stylists who worked on the film. “I’m sorry I was so mental,” she said. Later she gave another long list of thank-yous for the best-actress award.

Heath Ledger, who died last January at 28, was named best supporting actor in a film for his role as the Joker in “The Dark Knight,” the year’s biggest success at the box office. The film’s director, Christopher Nolan, accepted the award on Ledger’s behalf as the audience rose in a standing ovation.

“Wall-E” from Disney’s Pixar Animation unit was named the year’s best animated film.

HBO was the big winner on the television side, as expected. “John Adams” was on fire, picking up best mini-series, best actress (Laura Linney), best actor (Paul Giamatti) and best supporting actor (Tom Wilkinson). Gabriel Byrne won for best actor in a television drama series for playing a therapist on HBO’s “In Treatment,” and Anna Paquin won in the same category for her role in “True Blood,” the network’s vampire saga.

NBC’s “30 Rock” was named best comedy, and its star and creator, Tina Fey, was named best actress in a comedy, while her co-star, Alec Baldwin, won for best actor. “Mad Men” was best drama, with its creator thanking “his friends” at AMC. The cable network announced last week that the series would return for a third season this summer  with or without its creator and executive producer, Matthew Weiner, who is locked in a contract dispute with Lionsgate, the studio that produces the show.

“If you ever start to feel too good about yourself, they have this thing called the Internet,” Ms. Fey said in accepting her award. “You can find a lot of people who don’t like you.” Then she added, “I’d like to address some of them now,” rattled off a series of Web screen names of people who had written unkind things about her this year and gave each of them a salty response.

A rambunctious Tracy Morgan, a member of the “30 Rock” cast, accepted the award on behalf of the show by cracking that he made a deal with Ms. Fey: “If Barack Obama won, I would speak for the show from now on.” He added that he was pleased with the victory because “a black man can’t get no love” from the Emmy Awards.

The Golden Globes  given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 freelance writers  are not taken seriously as artistic milestones and have a history of voting idiosyncrasies. Still, the best-picture Oscar has mirrored the association’s choice for best drama or best comedy-musical in 14 of the last 21 years. And a Globe nomination is viewed as vital to maintaining momentum in the Oscar marathon.

So with Oscar nominations due to be announced next week all eyes were on the International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, where a coterie of Hollywood luminaries gathered at a sea of circular tables to eat, drink and see who walks away with a trophy.

Dozens of entertainment figures  among them Martin Scorsese, Sigourney Weaver and Johnny Depp  presented awards during the ceremony. The Golden Globes were televised in more than 160 countries this year, and more than 20 million people in the United States were expected to watch the telecast even though it faced heavy competition from the season premiere of “24” on Fox.

Steven Spielberg received the annual Cecil B. DeMille Award for “outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.”

Films that had much to gain from the Globes included “The Reader,” from the Weinstein Company, and “Revolutionary Road,” from Paramount Vantage and DreamWorks, both nominees for best dramatic picture, and “Milk,” from Focus Features, with a star, Sean Penn, nominated for best dramatic actor.

Because the awards recognize movies and television shows, the Golden Globe ceremony is one of the most star-studded events of the year, and because it is a dinner party with wine and Champagne, it is often more relaxed than the Oscars. But given the nation’s sour economy, Hollywood had been unsure of how to handle the self-congratulation-a-thon.

In the end, the Globes decided to pour on the glitter whether it fit the cultural mood or not, driven in part by last year’s dreadful experience, in which the gala was replaced by a drab news conference because of a writers’ strike. NBC lost viewers and millions of dollars.

The production featured more elaborate sets than in past years, a redesigned statuette (more detailing) and a more extravagant dinner (“aromatic Asian spice marinated sea bass with sherry yuzu pepper sauce”). Dick Clark Productions, which produced the telecast for NBC, said that more than 200 celebrities were expected to attend and that the red carpet  more of a zoo than normal, certain Hollywood watchers observed  was stocked with at least 500 microphones and cameras to capture celebrity fashions and beam chit-chat to the masses.

The press association had tried to curate a show that featured a younger set of stars, something that it had hoped would attract younger viewers. To that end, Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, the stars of Disney’s “High School Musical” franchise, were presenters along with the Jonas Brothers. Many nominees were notable for their youth this time around, with Miley Cyrus receiving a nomination for best song and James Franco nominated for his acting in the comedy “Pineapple Express.”

The walk-up to the Globes over the weekend included the usual assortment of parties and frolic, with Paramount hosting a party at the Chateau Marmont on Saturday night for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and Miramax and Walt Disney Studios inviting the throngs to the rooftop at the Beverly Wilshire in honor of films that include “Doubt” and “Wall-E.”

As Sunday dawned  sunny and warm, with temperatures in the Beverly Hills 90210 zone pointed toward the upper 70s  it became clear the audience still had a large appetite for a legend like Clint Eastwood, even if those who vote for the Globes largely bypassed him this year. The morning box office reports put his “Gran Torino” on top with about $29 million in ticket sales, as it spread from a handful of theaters to more than 2,800 locations around the country.

Inside the awards banquet, Ms. Linney and Meryl Streep were all hugs, and Mr. Spielberg schmoozed like a new kid in town. “It’s a reunion for these people,” said one waiter who has worked the event before.

Ms. Winslet made a beeline for the hotel’s door to get off the throbbing red carpet. “This event is wonderful, but there is so much pressure, so much madness out here, you don’t know where to look,” she said.

Her co-star in “Revolutionary Road,” Mr. DiCaprio, stopped to talk about the country’s economic woes.

“There are a lot of problems out there in the world, many of them serious, many of them that I care deeply about, but who am I, or any other actor, to get in the way of tradition?” he said. “I think it’s O.K. to take a night off and have some fun.”

Not everyone was joining in the frolic. When Kristin Scott Thomas, the English actress, was asked who or what she was wearing, she said, “My skin.”
337 2009-01-12 The Obama family is nearing a decision on the breed for the first dog.

Before President-elect Barack Obama began his interview on the ABC program “This Week,” which was broadcast Sunday, his daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, asked the host, George Stephanopoulos, to slip in this question: “What kind of a dog are we getting, and when are we getting it?”

When asked, Mr. Obama laughed “They seem to have narrowed it down to a Labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound,” he said, adding that the next step is to canvass shelters.

“We’re closing in on it,” he said. “This has been tougher than finding a commerce secretary,” a reference to the recent withdrawal by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico as his original selection for that post.

Both breeds — a Labradoodle at top, a Portuguese water dog below — were chosen to reduce Malia’s allergy to dogs and have big Democratic backers. Senator Edward M. Kennedy owns two Portuguese water dogs, Sunny and Splash, which often flank him as he walks the halls of the Capitol. Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son Hunter has a Labradoodle (part Labrador retriever, part poodle) named Brother.

Fulfilling his promise to get a dog is just one of the personal decisions that Mr. Obama and his family face as they settle into Washington.

Mr. Obama said the family planned to visit a number of churches to see “what’s comfortable.” Every president since James Madison has attended St. John’s, the Federal-style Episcopal church across Lafayette Square from the White House. But several predominantly black churches are eager to lure the Obamas, like Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, where Bill Clinton twice attended inaugural prayer services.
338 2009-01-12 Google, whose chief executive endorsed Barack Obama during the campaign, is having a party when Mr. Obama takes office.

“We’re calling it an alternative to traditional inaugural balls,” said a Google spokesman, Adam Kovacevich.

The party, on Jan. 20, is meant for both Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Kovacevich said, even though Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, publicly endorsed Mr. Obama in the fall.

In addition six senior Google executives have given $25,000 to Mr. Obama’s inauguration fund, including Mr. Schmidt; Larry Page, a Google co-founder; and Chad Hurley, a co-founder of YouTube, which is now owned by Google. All told, Google executives have given more than employees of any other corporation except Microsoft and DreamWorks.

Google has been trying to become a fixture in Washington life since 2005, when it hired its first full-time lobbyist. But its courtship of Washington faltered this fall. Google had announced an advertising agreement with Yahoo, which the Justice Department reviewed. Despite intense lobbying from Google — and amid opposition from Microsoft, an old hand in Washington — the Justice Department said it would block the deal. Google canceled the agreement before an antitrust suit was filed.
339 2009-01-12 The financially troubled Vancouver dance company Ballet BC, which recently announced the cancellation of a spring tour, reported some better news on Friday: the company’s creditors unanimously approved a repayment plan, Ballet BC announced. Under the plan the company will pay creditors the first $500 of any money owed and 25 cents on the dollar for the remaining debt. Ballet BC also raised pledged donations of $200,000, allowing the company to bring its artistic director, John Alleyne, and the dancers back to work to begin rehearsing for next month’s performances of “Carmen.”
340 2009-01-12 JAKARTA, Indonesia — More than 200 people are missing and feared dead after a passenger ferry sank in high seas off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Sunday morning, the police and government officials said.

The officials said the ferry had been carrying about 250 passengers and 17 crew members. A fishing boat found 18 survivors, including the captain, who had been drifting on life rafts for hours in rough seas.

The captain later told officials that 100 or more people had jumped off the boat in panic before it sank, but he said he did not know what had happened to them.

A port official in Parepare, where the ferry first departed late Saturday afternoon, said that rescuers had been dispatched, but were having trouble reaching the scene because of bad weather.

The last contact with the boat was made by radio about 2 a.m. Sunday, when the ship’s captain reported huge swells of more than seven feet. Later, a survivor told the local news media that the waves had reached as high as 14 feet.

“We have sent people to Majene, the closest town to where the ship sank, but we have been unable to get any more information,” said Alwi Tika, the port official. “The storm is making it difficult to get in contact with anyone in that area.”
341 2009-01-12 Nearly 900 people have been killed, according to Palestinian Health Ministry officials. Thirteen Israelis have been killed, Israel has said.

European diplomats involved in the Egypt negotiations said Sunday that the next 48 hours would be crucial for Israel to decide if a durable cease-fire can be achieved.

The Israeli cabinet secretary, Oved Yehezkel, told reporters that in the cabinet meeting the heads of army intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin, and of the Shin Bet security service, Yuval Diskin, said, “It is the inclination within Hamas to agree to a cease-fire, given the harsh blow it received and given the absence of accomplishment on the ground.”

The Israelis said this view inside Gaza was a contrast to the “unyielding stands” of the exiled Hamas leadership in Damascus, Syria, in particular Khaled Meshal, the political director. But Hamas “is not expected to wave a white flag” and is reserving rockets and weaponry to fire at the end of the conflict, the intelligence chiefs said.

Another senior Israeli security official said that Israeli soldiers had “confirmed through their sights” the killing of 300 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters on the ground in Gaza, and that Hamas units were making mistakes and fighting without clear direction.

“I can say with a high level of confidence that for two days, what we have been hearing repeatedly is that Hamas inside Gaza is eager — eager — to achieve a cease-fire,” said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the issue’s delicate nature. “This is as opposed to the leadership in Damascus that is willing to fight to the last Palestinian.”

The Israelis were clearly all pushing a concerted message, but no official provided details on how Israel supported its assertion. It was impossible to get a response from Hamas leaders in Gaza, because they were in hiding from Israeli military strikes.

On Saturday, the Hamas political director in exile, Mr. Meshal, said in Damascus that Hamas would not consider a cease-fire until Israel ended the assault and opened all crossings into Gaza. He said that the ferocity of the Israeli campaign had crossed the line and called it a “holocaust,” adding, “You have destroyed the last chance for negotiations.”

Israel and the United States are trying to secure agreement on a deal brokered by Egypt that would mean a Hamas commitment to stop all rocket firing into Israel and an Egyptian commitment to block smuggling tunnels into Gaza, to stop the resupplying of Hamas with weaponry and cash. In return, Israel would agree to a cease-fire and the opening of its crossings into Gaza for goods and fuel and the opening of the Rafah crossing into Egypt, with European Union supervision.

Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and now an international envoy to the Palestinians, said in an interview that “the only way this is going to stop is if there is a genuine plan to end the smuggling into Gaza and a genuine plan to open the crossings.”

Mr. Blair will be in Cairo on Monday, as will a senior Israeli Defense Ministry official, Amos Gilad. A Hamas delegation is already in Cairo talking to the Egyptians through the intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman. If the Egyptian effort fails, Israeli officials said, the military is likely to go to a “third stage” of the war against Hamas in Gaza, with the reserve troops thrown into the battle.

An expansion of the war would most likely mean Israeli troops moving into southern Gaza, to take a strip of land at least 500 yards wide inside Gaza at the Egyptian border. Israel has been bombing the area to try to destroy smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt.

Mr. Olmert and his two top cabinet ministers, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, were reported to disagree about the best way to win the war and consolidate Israeli gains. But they are under pressure from the army to decide on whether to expand the war or end it, in part because the soldiers become easier targets unless they are constantly moving.

On Sunday, the fighting started before dawn in the Sheikh Ajleen neighborhood, in the southwestern edge of Gaza City, with Israeli troops moving north from Netzarim, where they had earlier cut the Gaza Strip in two. In a sense, the Israelis opened a second front from the south, because they have also been fighting on the northern outskirts of Gaza City.

At least 20 Palestinians died by midday, when fighting ebbed somewhat, said Palestinian hospital officials. The fighting was described as fierce and close to Al Quds Hospital in Sheikh Ajleen. Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had ambushed the Israelis, but there was no immediate indication that any Israeli soldiers had been hurt.

Palestinian medical workers said that three other militants were killed by airstrikes.

Israeli warplanes also bombed along the Egypt-Gaza border near the town of Rafah, where the smuggling tunnels are.

Three rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel on Sunday morning, Israeli Army radio said. Two exploded near Beersheba, wounding several people. The third hit empty land. Mr. Diskin, the Shin Bet chief, told the cabinet that Israel had estimated that up to 200 rockets a day were being fired from Gaza once the operation started, but that the numbers fired now were in the 20s.

There was a new development on Sunday in the investigation into one of the deadliest attacks so far — an Israeli mortar strike near a United Nations school on Tuesday that killed up to 43 Palestinians. The newspaper Haaretz reported that a military investigation had concluded that two Israeli shells hit a Hamas mortar unit that had fired first, but that an errant Israeli shell hit near the school.

The army later rebutted the article, saying its initial inquiry showed “mortars were fired from within the school” at Israeli forces nearby, “and those forces returned fire.”

United Nations officials have denied that any Palestinian fighters were in the school grounds and called for an independent international investigation, and the army had earlier gone back and forth about whether the Hamas mortars were fired within the school or near it.

In a news conference on Sunday, a senior United Nations official, Maxwell Gaylard, the deputy special coordinator for the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, said that the humanitarian situation for Gaza’s 1.5 million people was deteriorating.

“People are terrified, hungry, thirsty and traumatized,” he said. “The civilian population is caught in the middle of this conflict,” he said, and added, “This is a conflict where the civilian population has nowhere to flee.”

He called for “an immediate cease-fire” in Gaza and said that the daily three-hour lulls in the fighting permitted by the Israelis for humanitarian deliveries were insufficient.

Aidan O’Leary, deputy director in Gaza for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which deals with Palestinian refugees, said that the flow of people internally displaced by the fighting had doubled in the past few days, and that there were at least 26,000 people in United Nations centers for the displaced, while another 60,000 people were taking shelter with relatives or friends.

353 2009-01-13 WASHINGTON  Physics met politics at the confirmation hearing Tuesday for Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate scientist chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to head the Department of Energy, and the physics bent a bit, as Dr. Chu backed away slightly from earlier statements he has made  that gasoline prices should be higher, and that coal was his “nightmare.”

Dr. Chu, whose last job was director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, answered an array of questions from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  about his position on new nuclear reactors (yes, at least for a few plants), offshore drilling (only as part of an energy package) and new coal-burning power plants (a few, until we figure out a better way). He told the lawmakers that “last year’s rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices not only contributed to the recession we are now experiencing, it also put a huge strain on the budgets of families all across America.”

Last September, though, he told The Wall Street Journal, “Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.” At the hearing, responding to a question about that statement, he said, “What the American family does not want is to pay an increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, for energy costs, both in transportation and keeping their homes warm and lit.”

The answer is efficiency, using less so that even if the price rises, the bill does not, he said.

He also said that coal, which has a wide political constituency, would continue to be used, and that the trick was to convert it to electricity cleanly.

Dr. Chu, who is 60, got a friendly welcome from the committee, but really warmed up when Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, asked him how plants could be turned into substitutes for petroleum.

“Actually, now we’re getting to science, I love this,” he said, to laughter around the room. He said he had supervised research to figure out, “How do you break those plants down into the kind of sugars these little critters, the yeast and bacteria, can actually use.” Gene-altered bacteria have been developed to turn sugar into substitutes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, he said.

Several senators reiterated the idea that the Energy Department faced terrific scientific challenges, and that a Nobel physicist was the appropriate person to head it. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who introduced him to the committee, referred to him as “one of the great brilliant thinkers of his generation.” Around Washington, Dr. Chu draws wide approval for emphasizing energy efficiency and new technology as approaches to the problems of energy prices and global warming.

But his science-based frankness sometimes contrasts with ordinary energy politics, which are often more centered on narrower economic interests.

For example, in a presentation at Berkeley in April 2007, now preserved on YouTube, he declared, “coal is my worst nightmare,” words previous energy secretaries would be unlikely to utter.

“We have lots of fossil fuel,” he said in that presentation. “That’s really both good and bad news. We won’t run out of energy but there’s enough carbon in the ground to really cook us.”

And he has said frankly that some of the technologies that federal dollars are pursuing would be nice to have, but are not today ready for use, either because they are too expensive to be practical, or not demonstrated to be safe. In this category he puts sequestering the carbon dioxide from power plants, recycling nuclear fuel to reduce its volume and recover unused fuel, and making ethanol from cellulose, which is essentially woody wastes or non-crop plants.

In the course of the hearing, the main mission of the department  making, maintaining and dismantling nuclear weapons, and cleaning up from six decades of nuclear weapon production  got intermittent mention. According to a report on nuclear weapons spending by Stephen I. Schwartz and sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment, the budget for nuclear weapons in 2008 was over $52 billion. Robert Alvarez, who was a policy advisor to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration, said in an interview that the department is spending about 11 times more money on nuclear weapons than on energy conservation.

Dr. Chu’s plans for steps that would reduce consumption of oil and electricity may come at an inopportune moment, as consumption is falling anyway, taking pressure off the electric grid and other energy systems. The Energy Information Administraton, which analyzes data for the department, predicted on Tuesday that for 2009, electricity consumption would fall 0.5 percent, and oil product consumption by 2 percent. Dr. Chu faces a variety of conflicting mandates. For example, he said that using more renewable energy was a national priority and thus would require a national electric grid. To help create such a grid, a 2005 law gives the department the authority to designate high-priority corridors, to overrule local objections to new power lines. But Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, complained that the department had designated his entire state, New Jersey, as part of a corridor. Dr. Chu promised to investigate.

Another problem is nuclear waste. Dr. Chu repeatedly said that of the carbon-free power generation in this country, 70 percent was nuclear. But Mr. Obama has expressed deep skepticism about the plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the government has worked for 20 years to develop. A solution would have to be found, Dr. Chu said, but construction of new plants should resume now, after a hiatus of 30 years, even before the solution is developed.

371 2009-01-13 The Borders Group, the troubled book chain, plans to name a hedge fund executive as its chairman on Tuesday as part of its effort to stay afloat, a person with knowledge of the announcement said.

The appointment of the executive, Richard McGuire, to replace Larry Pollock as chairman would occur a week after Borders named Ron Marshall, a private equity executive with corporate turnaround experience, as its chief executive. Mr. McGuire, known as Mick, is an executive at Pershing Square Capital Management, the activist fund that is Borders’s largest shareholder and has agitated for change at the company over the last year.

Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., has been working with restructuring advisers to assist in negotiating with vendors and lenders, people briefed on the matter said. These include AlixPartners, a consulting firm; Jones Day, a law firm with a well-regarded restructuring practice; and Rothschild, the investment bank.

Several of these advisers have worked for Borders for months, and their hiring does not necessarily mean that it will file for bankruptcy. The advisers declined to comment. A Borders spokeswoman declined to comment.

Beyond its shares in Borders, Pershing Square also lent the company $42.5 million in April. That comes due next month. Pershing Square’s main fund lost money in 2008, hobbled by losing bets not only on Borders but also other retailers, including Target.
372 2009-01-13 WASHINGTON  Republican and Democratic Senate leaders signaled on Monday that they would support the release of the second half of the Treasury’s $700 billion financial system bailout fund, despite anger among many rank-and-file lawmakers over the Bush administration’s management of the program.

As Congress prepared to act, regulators directed thousands of banks to provide more information about how they have used the money received through the bailout program, responding to concern that financial institutions were hoarding the cash rather than lending it to businesses and consumers.

President-elect Barack Obama said on Monday that like Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, his administration would demand substantially greater oversight of the program.

President Bush on Monday formally requested the $350 billion from Congress at the urging of Mr. Obama.

Under the bailout law, Congress can block the money but only if the House and Senate act to do so. The Senate is expected to vote on the request as early as Thursday.

Aides said that Mr. Obama would attend the weekly lunch of Democratic senators at the Capitol on Tuesday, where he was expected to encourage his former colleagues to approve the bailout money as well as discuss details of his proposed $800 billion recovery package.

Mr. Obama made calls to a number of senators in both parties Monday, including Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee.

After a meeting with the president of Mexico on Monday, Mr. Obama said the additional $350 billion would be critical to his efforts to stabilize the economy.

“It is clear that the financial system, although improved from where it was in September, is still fragile, and I felt that it would be irresponsible for me with the first $350 billion already spent, to enter into the administration without any potential ammunition should there be some sort of emergency or weakening of the financial system,” Mr. Obama said.

“I think many of us have been disappointed with the absence of clarity, the lack of transparency, the failure to track how the money’s been spent and the failure to take bold action with respect to areas like housing, consumer credit, so that we can maintain credit,” he said.

In conjunction with Mr. Bush’s announcement, Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama’s designee to be director of the National Economic Council, sent a letter to Congressional leaders, pressing them to approve the funds and promising to overhaul the bailout program, including more oversight and a sweeping new effort to prevent home foreclosures.

Mr. Summers said the Obama administration would also impose tough conditions on companies receiving aid, including limits on executive pay and shareholder dividends. “We will ensure that resources are directed to increasing lending and preventing new financial crises and not to enriching shareholders or executives,” he wrote.

Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also moved on Monday to reassure critics who had complained that banks were not using the bailout money as intended to increase the flow of credit.

The F.D.I.C. directed the 5,100 banks that it regulates to document how they have used government money that they have received.

The agency did not spell out or even imply how much of the money that banks receive should go toward new lending, as opposed to building capital reserves or making acquisitions. But in requiring the banks to provide information, the F.D.I.C. went further than any of the other federal regulators to put pressure on lenders.

The Senate’s approval of the $350 billion would be a big relief for the Obama administration, which is hoping to avoid a messy legislative battle just as the new president takes office. That outcome seemed increasingly likely as some influential senators said they would urge their colleagues to approve the money.

“It’s extremely important that we make these dollars available to the new administration so there is as much flexibility as possible to stabilize the financial system,” Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said. Critics, including an oversight panel, have accused the Bush administration of badly mismanaging the program, in part by not adequately tracking how private banks have used bailout funds.

But some lawmakers said the bailout, formally called the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, had accomplished its main goal by preventing a further deterioration of the credit and stock markets.

“Without the first TARP, we may have a Dow at 4,000 right now and the economy in an absolutely free fall,” Mr. Conrad said.

But the request for the bailout money is still certain to generate impassioned debate.
373 2009-01-13 President-elect Barack Obama has asked V. Gene Robinson, the openly gay Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, to deliver the invocation at an inaugural event on Sunday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Gay rights advocates saw the move as a way to compensate for Mr. Obama’s decision to give the Rev. Rick Warren, a prominent megachurch pastor from California who opposes same-sex marriage, the high-profile role of delivering the invocation at the inauguration next week.

Bishop Robinson advised Mr. Obama on gay rights issues during the campaign. He is the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church, and his consecration in 2003 set off a growing rift in that church’s parent body, the Anglican Communion. Since then, Bishop Robinson has become an internationally known spokesman for gay rights — a hero to some and an object of scorn to others.

In a telephone interview on Monday, Bishop Robinson said that he believed his inclusion in inaugural events had been under consideration before the controversy erupted over Mr. Warren but that Mr. Obama and his team were also seeking to heal the pain that Mr. Warren’s selection had caused among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocates.

“They called up and said this has actually been in the works for a long time,” Bishop Robinson said, “and at the same time, we understand that people in the L.G.B.T. community have been somewhat wounded by this choice, and it’s our hope that your selection will go a long way to heal those divides.”
374 2009-01-13 Mr. Merckle’s suicide shocked Germany as much as it angered Blaubeuren, where he was eulogized Monday at a memorial service that overflowed the hamlet’s church.

He was the embodiment of the Mittelstand, the corps of family-owned businesses that form the backbone of German manufacturing. Mr. Merckle, however, dared to step beyond the conservative confines of most German family entrepreneurs and delved into debt and complicated financial transactions to lighten his tax burden and enrich his empire.

“He formed a picture of the risks and acted,” Mr. Irgang said.

In the process, those who knew him well said, he developed a keen sense of how far to push — until the last two years.

During the sole interview he gave in the months before his death, to the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr. Merckle blamed a “chain reaction” that broke a financial model that had worked “superbly” before the crisis.

“The collapse on world markets led to negative effects for servicing existing loans, which in turn contributed to — in the view of the banks — to declining creditworthiness, which in turn created a corresponding reaction in the capital markets, and so forth,” he said.

His magical touch seemed to completely desert him on Oct. 28. Along with many seasoned investors, he was snared in a “short squeeze” after betting that shares in Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker, would fall.

Porsche, however, which is taking over the company, had secretly cornered nearly 75 percent of VW stock. This created a scarcity that sent VW shares to more than $1,200, giving the company, briefly, the highest market value in the world.

It was clear at the time that some of the biggest hedge funds in the world were caught in the squeeze. No one knew how many ordinary investors were caught. But in November, it became clear Mr. Merckle was one of them.

Adolf Merckle was born in 1934 into a German family with roots in the present-day Czech Republic. In the months after World War II, enraged Czechs expelled ethnic Germans. Many of those Germans, including Mr. Merckle’s father, came to West Germany, setting the stage for an economic renaissance.

The Merckles settled in Blaubeuren, near the industrial city of Ulm, where a small mountain range gives way to the foothills of the Alps. The elder Mr. Merckle re-established his wholesale chemicals business in a small building that still bears the family name.

His son moved the business from chemicals to pharmaceuticals, creating Ratiopharm in 1974. He tapped a growing demand for what became known as “branded generics,” pharmaceuticals that were not patented but were marketed under a trusted name.

Sales of paracetamol, a painkiller, fed Ratiopharm’s rapid growth. In 2007, it had sales of 1.7 billion euros, or $2.3 billion at current exchange rates.

Phoenix, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, was the second pillar of the Merckle empire. It had sales of 21.6 billion euros in its last full fiscal year.

Over time, Mr. Merckle amassed other properties, like a leather business and a maker of ski-slope grooming equipment. He even acquired a castle near the Baltic Sea, Schloss Hohen Luckow, where world leaders had dinner when Germany was host to the Group of 8 meeting in 2007.

At the same time, Mr. Merckle was using some of his companies mainly to reap tax and financial benefits — as opposed to building things, which is more valued by the Mittelstand and many Germans.

One Merckle business, Spohn Cement, was based in the north German village of Norderfriedrichskoog, population 40. Its only commercial relevance was, for many years, its low municipal business levy.

Mr. Merckle acquired his chief investment vehicle, VEM Vermögensverwaltung, based in Dresden, from the government agency charged with privatizing East Germany’s state assets after unification in 1990. Part of a small industrial conglomerate, its losses eased the Merckle empire’s tax burden.

VEM and Spohn bundled Merckle family holdings, but often via intermediary firms that together created a byzantine structure fully understood only by Mr. Merckle and his closest confidantes. (No one has said the tactics were illegal in any way.)

In 2005, Mr. Merckle took another leap that broke with the ethos of the Mittelstand: He embraced leverage, in a sector far afield from his own.

Spohn mounted a takeover offer for HeidelbergCement worth 6.5 billion euros. Spohn settled for buying half the company, a transaction that Mr. Merckle pulled off with loans collateralized by the shares acquired.

Months before the credit crisis began in August 2007, HeidelbergCement spent $15.8 billion to take over a British rival, Hanson, and VEM, the other Merckle vehicle, raised its stake in HeidelbergCement to nearly 90 percent when it bought all of a 500-million-share offering.

Shares of HeidelbergCement that had been worth 73.97 euros in mid-September closed Monday at 34.05. The company lost its investment-grade credit rating with Standard & Poor’s in October.

One theory of why Mr. Merckle speculated in Volkswagen stock is that it may have been a last, bold bid to rescue the Merckle family empire, according to one person briefed on the subsequent negotiations with banks, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of Mr. Merckle’s death.

“Either you are a gambler, or you are feeling a bit desperate and are trying to dig yourself out of a hole,” the person said. “And I don’t think he was a gambler.”

Whatever the reason, the short squeeze cost Mr. Merckle 400 million euros.

The losses created a severe cash shortage at VEM, and put Mr. Merckle at the mercy of a consortium of 30 banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank.

Mr. Merckle wanted to sell parts of his main businesses, an outcome that would have left him poorer, but still in control. But in the end, only a sale of Ratiopharm satisfied the banks.

That impending loss, people in Blaubeuren insisted, must have pushed Mr. Merckle to take his own life.

But at Mr. Merckle’s memorial service, Gerhard Maier, a retired Protestant bishop, said, “What brought a man of great will who felt responsible to God to the point where he took his own life is something that, deep down, we humans will never comprehend.”

Next to the cash register at Mr. Wiedenmann’s store, a card reads simply, “We mourn for Adolf Merckle.”
375 2009-01-13 WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday that senior officers must work to prevent the militarization of American foreign policy, and he urged generals and admirals to tell civilian leaders when they believed the armed forces should not take the lead in carrying out policies overseas.

Adm. Mike Mullen, who as chairman is the nation’s highest-ranking military officer, also called for more money and personnel to be devoted to the civilian agencies responsible for diplomacy and overseas economic development.

The military is engaged in deep soul-searching over the proper role of the armed forces in foreign policy. The debate has been inspired by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have forced the military to take on responsibilities far beyond combat, including tasks like economic reconstruction and political development that are often described as “nation building.”

“Our military is flexible, well funded, designed to take risk,” Admiral Mullen said in a speech at an evening ceremony of the Nixon Center, a Washington policy institute. “We respond well to orders from civilian authorities.”

Because of those traits, Admiral Mullen said, the military receives vast resources — and then is asked to do even more.
376 2009-01-13 A Greek shipping tycoon was kidnapped at gunpoint on Monday near his home outside Athens, in the third such high-profile abduction in Greece since June, the police said. The tycoon, Pericles Panagopoulos, the founder of the ferry operator Superfast Ferries, was abducted from his vehicle by three armed men as he was on the short drive from his home to his office in the coastal suburb of Kavouri. No one was injured. Mr. Panagopoulos, 74, and his driver were handcuffed and bundled into a waiting van. The driver was later released in Koropi, a town northeast of Athens. The kidnapping was being investigated by the antiterrorism police, but a police spokesman said it was believed to be the work of a criminal gang seeking a ransom.
377 2009-01-13 “Some of our sexuality has evolved to stimulate that same oxytocin system to create female-male bonds,” Dr. Young said, noting that sexual foreplay and intercourse stimulate the same parts of a woman’s body that are involved in giving birth and nursing. This hormonal hypothesis, which is by no means proven fact, would help explain a couple of differences between humans and less monogamous mammals: females’ desire to have sex even when they are not fertile, and males’ erotic fascination with breasts. More frequent sex and more attention to breasts, Dr. Young said, could help build long-term bonds through a “cocktail of ancient neuropeptides,” like the oxytocin released during foreplay or orgasm.

Researchers have achieved similar results by squirting oxytocin into people’s nostrils — not terribly sexy, but it seems to enhance feelings of trust and empathy. Although Dr. Young is not concocting any love potions (he’s looking for drugs to improve the social skills of people with autism and schizophrenia), he said there could soon be drugs that increase people’s urge to fall in love.

“It would be completely unethical to give the drug to someone else,” he said, “but if you’re in a marriage and want to maintain that relationship, you might take a little booster shot yourself every now and then. Even now it’s not such a far-out possibility that you could use drugs in conjunction with marital therapy.”

I see some potential here, but also big problems. Suppose you took that potion and then suddenly felt an urge to run off with the next person you spent any time with, like your dentist? What if you went to a business convention and then, like an artificially stimulated prairie vole, bonded with the nearest stranger? What if, like Tristan, you developed an overwhelming emotional connection to your boss’s spouse?

Even if the effects could somehow be targeted to the right partner, would you want to start building a long-term relationship with a short-term drug? What happens when it wears off?

A love vaccine seems simpler and more practical, and already there are some drugs that seem to inhibit people’s romantic impulses (see TierneyLab, at www.nytimes.com/tierneylab). Such a vaccine has already been demonstrated in prairie voles.

“If we give an oxytocin blocker to female voles, they become like 95 percent of other mammal species,” Dr. Young said. “They will not bond no matter how many times they mate with a male or hard how he tries to bond. They mate, it feels really good and they move on if another male comes along. If love is similarly biochemically based, you should in theory be able to suppress it in a similar way.”

I doubt many people would want to permanently suppress love, but a temporary vaccine could come in handy. Spouses going through midlife crises would not be so quick to elope with their personal trainers; elderly widowers might consult their lawyers before marrying someone resembling Anna Nicole Smith. Love is indeed a many-splendored thing, but sometimes we all need to tie ourselves to the mast.
378 2009-01-13 More than 40 people were missing after an open wooden boat capsized Sunday in the Atlantic off Guinea-Bissau, about 35 miles from the capital, Bissau, port staff members and fishermen said Monday. Fishermen rescued three passengers and recovered the body of another, said Jose Antonio Almaeda, the country’s transport minister. He said 42 people were missing.
379 2009-01-13 NEW ORLEANS — After a layup, a couple of rebounds and some huffing and puffing, Eddy Curry’s comeback is to be continued. In the world of Coach Mike D’Antoni’s hurry-up offense, the Knicks are eager to have Curry return to the court — and stay there — for incentives that span beyond rotations and lineups.

The Knicks could use Curry’s size to neutralize their smallish statue, but the time is dwindling for the organization to showcase him to other franchises. The Knicks have shopped Curry in an attempt to shed payroll for the free-agent class expected to be headlined by LeBron James the summer before Curry’s contract expires in 2011.

On Saturday, Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said he would make a trade before the Feb. 19 deadline only if it produced a quality player in return. He said he could make an exception to that if he could find a partner for Curry, whose heavy contract remained after the Knicks purged themselves of the large and lengthy deals of Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph this season.

To do that, Curry will have to first prove his readiness on the court in the next five weeks.

Curry had missed the entire season because of an injured right knee until he played 2 minutes 38 seconds against the Dallas Mavericks last Thursday. But after the next day’s practice, he reported soreness in the knee.

D’Antoni had hoped to use Curry, a 6-foot-11, 285-pounder, as a traditional center, the way he did Shaquille O’Neal with the Phoenix Suns last season. But nearly midway through his seventh season, Curry has not been able to leave the starting gate.

“Right now, the swelling is going down,” Curry said at a shootaround here before Monday night’s game against the Hornets. “It’s definitely moving in the right direction. I just don’t want nothing crazy to happen.”
380 2009-01-13 I probably could have gotten the Four Points and the Hyatt for a little less, but that’s part of the game. In their own ways, all three hotels were excellent values.

Do I recommend the blind-bidding option on Priceline.com? Yes, if you’re flexible and if you have done enough research to have a sense of what a hotel in a certain category should actually cost. But you can easily overbid for a hotel that might be had for less elsewhere, including the standard discount booking sites where prices are listed upfront, like Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and even Priceline, which also offers that option.

Priceline’s “Name Your Own Price” service is deliberately not marketed to business travelers, said Chris Soder, the president of North American travel for the company. He cited several reasons, including that a reservation was “absolutely noncancelable.” (Business travelers typically require more flexibility if plans change).

Also, hotels depend mightily on business travel revenue. He said that “business travelers tend to be some of the most valuable customers, the ones who tend to pay more.” So, he said, hotels were “not interested in discounting to those customers” through a blind-bidding service that often offers room rates at discounts of 50 percent or more.

On the other hand, business travelers and the companies that pay their expenses are becoming far more flexible, resourceful — and stingy — in a sour economy. For that reason, many business travelers are behaving more like leisure travelers.

Online booking sites, which are able to negotiate and design package travel deals that may combine air fare, hotel and car rentals into a single price, are now heavily promoting the benefits of packages. By being part of a package deal, hotels struggling for revenue can offer major discounts without significantly lowering their posted stand-alone rates.

“If a hotel lowers their stand-alone price, they condition travelers to expect a lower price” across the board, said Genevieve Shaw Brown, a senior editor and analyst at Travelocity. “If they put the discount into a package, it’s more opaque.”

Travelers can be misled by “flight fixation,” or an obsession with air fares in evaluating the cost of a trip, she said. Actually, Ms. Brown said, citing a recent study by Travelocity, “hotels are typically the most expensive part” of a trip — and the part where negotiated savings are now most readily available.
381 2009-01-13 Drivers over 70 are keeping their licenses longer and driving more than earlier generations, a trend that has led to dire predictions about car accident risks for aging baby boomers.

But new research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety should ease those fears. It shows that fatal car accidents involving older drivers have actually declined markedly in the past decade.

“It’s not what people had expected to see,” said Anne T. McCartt, senior vice president for research at the insurance institute. “There were some studies, including our own research, that had predicted older driver crashes would become a bigger and bigger problem.”

Compared with middle-age drivers (ages 35 to 54), drivers 75 or older have far higher death rates per mile traveled. (So do drivers under 20.) Death rates jump markedly after age 80. But that does not necessarily mean that older people are worse drivers or that they are far more likely to crash.

Car fatalities involving young people are almost entirely explained by the fact that they have more accidents than experienced drivers. But while crash rates are slightly higher for older people, most of their increased risk for a fatal car accident is explained by the fact that they tend to be more frail. Older drivers are more likely to suffer a severe injury, particularly to the chest, or other medical complications.
382 2009-01-13 At the time, the government was criticized for being too slow in reacting to the global slowdown, and for putting forward a stimulus package that was considered too small. Mrs. Merkel said she was not prepared to go on a spending spree, and increase the budget deficit.

The new measures, if approved, follow 10 weeks of discussions among the political parties, industry, trade unions and lobbyists. It is not yet settled how the 50 billion euros would be distributed, but a large part of it will be reserved for infrastructure projects in an effort to prevent a steep rise in unemployment, finance ministry officials said.

According to Morgan Stanley Research, net job creation is likely to give way to net job losses during 2009.

“We expect employment to shrink 1.4 percent from peak to trough, equivalent to 550,000 jobs being lost, and see the unemployment rate rising from 7.7 percent of the labor force to 9.5 percent,” the report’s author, Elga Bartsch, said.

Another part of the stimulus plan could include a reduction in employer and employee contributions to the public health system, which would, in effect, eliminate the increases in such payments that were introduced on Jan. 1. The idea is to decrease labor costs as an incentive for companies to avoid layoffs.

There are also tax breaks for those who buy new cars, with the cancellation of the car tax for a limited time.

The loan guarantees of up to 100 billion euros are supposed to give companies access to credit at cheap rates, although the details were still being worked out. Finance ministry officials said it was premature to say whether the government would consider seeking equity stakes in return.

Jürgen Ruttgers, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia who represents the more liberal wing of Mrs. Merkel’s conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union, had for weeks been calling on the government to create such a fund for companies outside the banking sector.

Conservative party officials said Mrs. Merkel had agreed to the new fund, which her coalition partner, the Social Democrats, supported, apparently in exchange for an end to calls for immediate tax cuts.

But economists questioned the necessity of such a fund as well as the unclear way in which it would be administered.

“If there is any reason for the fund, it is political,” Stefan Schneider, economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, said. “This gives politicians an opportunity to make friends and increase the number of voters in time for the federal elections.”
383 2009-01-13 “Every infant is born adorable but selfish and the center of the universe,” she replied. It’s a parent’s job to teach that “there are other people, and other people have feelings.”

The conversations that every pediatrician has, over and over, about “limit setting” and “consistently praising good behavior” are conversations about manners. And when you are in the exam room with a child who seems to have none, you begin to wonder what is going on at home and at school, and questions of family dysfunction or neurodevelopmental problems begin to cross your mind.

Dr. Barbara Howard, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and an expert on behavior and development, told me that a child’s manners were a perfectly appropriate topic to raise at a pediatric visit.

“It has a huge impact on people’s lives — why wouldn’t you bring it up?” she said. “Do they look you in the eye? If you stick your hand out do they shake it? How do they interact with the parents; do they interrupt, do they ask for things, do they open Mommy’s purse and take things out?”

Dr. Howard suggested that the whole “manners” concept might seem a little out of date — until you recast it as “social skills,” a very hot term these days. Social skills are necessary for school success, she pointed out; they affect how you do on the playground, in the classroom, in the workplace.

We also think of social skills as a profound set of challenges that complicate the lives of children — and adults — on what is now called the autism spectrum. Children with autism, whether mild or severe, have great difficulty learning social codes, deciphering subtle body language or tone of voice, and catching on to the rules of the game.

Therapy for these children can include systematic training in social skills, sometimes using scripts for common human interactions. And one lesson, Dr. Howard said, “is that you can teach this stuff, and we maybe aren’t teaching it as well as we should be to children who are developing normally.”

And of course, one of the long-term consequences of being a rude child is being a rude adult — even a rude doctor. There are bullies on the playground and bullies in the workplace; it can be quite disconcerting to encounter a mature adult with 20 or so years of education under his belt who still sees the world only in terms of his own wants, needs and emotions: I want that so give it to me; I am angry so I need to hit; I am wounded so I must howl.

I like Miss Manners’ approach because it lets a parent respect a child’s intellectual and emotional privacy: I’m not telling you to like your teacher; I’m telling you to treat her with courtesy. I’m not telling you that you can’t hate Tommy; I’m telling you that you can’t hit Tommy. Your feelings are your own private business; your behavior is public.

But that first big counterintuitive lesson — that there are other people out there whose feelings must be considered — affects a child’s most basic moral development. For a child, as for an adult, manners represent a strategy for getting along in life, but also a successful intellectual engagement with the business of being human.

I did not enjoy visits with my rude patient. Despite his generally good health and his normal developmental milestones, I couldn’t help feeling that the adult world had failed to guide and protect him. He was loud and demanding and insistent, but one of his basic needs had not been met: no one had taught him manners.

As a pediatrician, I worry about the trajectories of children’s growth and development: measuring a baby’s head size, weighing a toddler, asking about the language skills of a preschooler. Manners are another side of the journey every child makes from helplessness to autonomy. And a child who learns to manage a little courtesy, even under the pressure of a visit to the doctor, is a child who is operating well in the world, a child with a positive prognosis.
384 2009-01-13 The companies will then have until March 31 to show progress in executing the plans, or risk having the loans recalled. Chrysler received a $4 billion loan.

Mr. Wagoner said that talks have been continuing with the United Automobile Workers on how to reduce labor costs to be competitive with Toyota and other foreign automakers. He declined to say how the costs would be reduced, what terms G.M. might seek to revamp more than $60 billion in debt or how it would cut the ranks of its dealers and its brands.

G.M. was in danger of running out of enough cash to operate its business before the federal loans were approved by President Bush in December.

Mr. Wagoner said that while G.M. was not “100 percent” certain it would survive long term, he said the company was confident it could avoid a bankruptcy filing this year.

“It is only prudent for us to be prepared for all options,” Mr. Wagoner said of the possibility of bankruptcy. “But my personal view is that there are options that can work in each of the areas — working with the union, working with the bondholders — that can get us to the position that we need to demonstrate viability.”

G.M. had initially sought up to $18 billion in loans to shore up its sinking finances, but only $13.4 billion was made available.

Mr. Wagoner said the aid would last G.M. through the first quarter, and the company had yet to decide whether it would seek further help after that. “By March 31, we’ll be able to address whether additional funding may be forthcoming or not,” he said. “We really haven’t said whether we will or we won’t need money after that period.”

Chrysler’s chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, said his company did need further assistance beyond the $4 billion it received this month.

Chrysler had asked for $7 billion to pay its bills and complete its downsizing. When asked if Chrysler was counting on getting the additional $3 billion this year, Mr. Nardelli, said, “Yes, we are counting on it.”

The financial woes of G.M. and Chrysler have made the Detroit show far more downbeat than in years past. Persistent questions about their financial situations have tested the patience of executives at both companies.

“It seems like we can never answer these questions enough times,” said Mark LaNeve, G.M.’s head of North American sales and marketing.

Mr. LaNeve has been involved in talks with G.M.’s dealers about how the company intends to cut its dealer ranks to 4,700, from 6,400, within the next four years.

He has also been working with Saturn dealers about G.M.’s plans for the brand. In the business plan that G.M. submitted to the government in December, the company said it was studying whether Saturn had a long-term place in its brand lineup.

G.M. is also in the process of trying to sell its Hummer brand and possibly put its Saab unit up for sale.

“We are working our way through these issues,” Mr. LaNeve said. “We hope to have some clarity on them by the submission in February.”
385 2009-01-13 Jerry Reese, the team’s general manager, said Burress “has certain things in his personal life he needs to get cleaned up.” When asked if the Giants would accept him back, Reese said, “Never say never.”

Burress has been in physical rehabilitation for his wound, Reese said. He compared Burress to Spider-Man for his size and pass-catching skills. “I want to see him be O.K. as a person, turn over a new leaf in his life, take care of himself first,” Reese said.

Other issues facing the Giants, who failed to successfully defend their Super Bowl title, include the free agency of their two top running backs, Brandon Jacobs and Derrick Ward, as well as safety James Butler and Amani Toomer, the veteran receiver.

Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator, is a candidate to coach the Jets, the Detroit Lions and the St. Louis Rams. The Giants have two kickers, John Carney and Lawrence Tynes, for one role. “There’s always changes,” Reese said.

Jacobs said again Monday that he hoped to return to the Giants, his team since his rookie year of 2005, but that it was a matter of money. “Change with us is going to come down to presidents,” Jacobs said, referring to the images on currency. “Set ourselves up after this violent sport is over.”

Jacobs played the last few games with a sore left knee. He said he did not expect to have surgery. Justin Tuck, a defensive end, played with various injuries to his right leg. Tuck and Coach Tom Coughlin said no surgery was expected, but they did not sound certain.

Tuck said, “At this point, no,” and Coughlin said, “I don’t think so.” But Coughlin added: “It takes time. It’s going to need to be rested.” He also said that he told players that if they needed surgery, they should have it done right away.

Tuck said he was planning to go to the Pro Bowl, which will be played Feb. 8 in Hawaii. He wore a blue varsity-style jacket with an old-school Giants logo of a player passing a ball above the old Yankee Stadium, before it was remodeled.

Sack totals dropped drastically in the late season for Tuck and his teammates on the defensive line. “Pretty banged up,” Tuck said of their injuries.

Most players were available to reporters Monday. But noticeable in his absence for a second day was Antonio Pierce.

Pierce is the middle linebacker and a captain, a key spokesman. But his performance sagged noticeably after he was with Burress in a Manhattan nightclub when Burress wounded himself in the thigh.

Pierce was at the team meeting Monday, and Coughlin said they spoke. “He’s sorrowful, disappointed, probably a little bit discouraged,” Coughlin said. “How many times are you the No. 1 seed? I’m sure he’s reflecting on that today.”

Pierce said often in recent weeks that he was tired. He is 30 and has played eight seasons. It is not out of the question that the Giants would use free agency, trades or the draft to seek out another middle linebacker.

They also may seek receivers. Burress has been charged with two felonies, and Reese said it would not be smart to put “all your eggs in that basket.” The N.F.L. Players Association has filed a grievance against the Giants seeking to recover Burress’s pay.

Burress has four years remaining on a five-year, $35 million contract signed hours before the season’s first game. Toomer, Steve Smith, Domenik Hixon and other receivers were unable to replace the connection that Burress had with Manning.

Manning said Burress had not returned his messages. But David Tyree, an injured receiver who missed the season after last winter’s Super Bowl heroics, said he has been in contact with Burress recently.

“The cloak of invincibility has now passed,” Tyree said, seemingly speaking of Burress and the team in general. Tyree is religious and frequently speaks of it, including his own transformation from a wayward lifestyle.

“People want to see you pay for the mistakes you make,” Tyree said of Burress. “Are you going to be the one to tear him down or to build him up?”

Manning, who was unshaven and looked tired Monday, passed poorly Sunday. Of Burress, he said, “Hopefully, you learn from your mistakes.” Of himself against the Eagles, he said: “I didn’t play my best. I definitely could have played better.”

Coughlin, who avoided questions about Burress, said of the team and the end of the season: “It’s not a good day. It’s not a happy day. It’s a long day. It’s a tough day. Maybe it hurts more than it ever has hurt.”

The Giants’ locker room is also their daily clubhouse beginning in late August, and it bears their personal touches. On the cinderblock wall next to Zak DeOssie’s locker is something called the “High-Motor White Guy Hall of Fame.” As of Monday, those pictures remained, including a black-and-white photo of Coughlin as a Syracuse receiver in the 1960s.

Next to Ward’s locker was a list of “shower pill” players, those who leave without taking showers after workouts. “That stays,” Ward said.

On the other side of the room, on the floor next to Kareem McKenzie’s corner locker, was the teddy bear that McKenzie decorated with a leg bandage and more recently with little shoulder pads.

McKenzie was asked where the bear would hibernate. “He stays here all winter,” he said. “He’s been here three years now. I come in and check on him every once in a while.”
386 2009-01-13 WASHINGTON  The White House on Monday said that President Bush, at the urging of President-elect Barack Obama, would formally ask a reluctant Congress to release the second half of the Treasury’s $700 billion financial system bailout fund, setting the stage for a potentially messy legislative battle straddling the incoming and outgoing administrations.

“This morning, President-elect Obama asked President Bush to formally notify Congress, on his behalf, of his intent to exercise the authority under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to access the last tranche of $350 billion in funding for Treasury programs addressing the financial crisis,” Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “President Bush agreed to the president-elect’s request.”

The decision to request the money now reflects the calculation by Mr. Obama and his aides that it would be better to have both the incoming and outgoing presidents urging lawmakers to release the money, given the high level of anger and frustration on Capitol Hill over how the Bush administration has managed the bailout program.

In addition, Lawrence H. Summers, who will be Mr. Obama’s top economic adviser at the White House, released a three-page letter on Monday addressed to the top Congressional leaders of both parties asking for the authority to release the rest of the rescue plan while promising a five-point plan ensuring the money would be used for lending or preventing further crises and not for “enriching shareholders and executives.” To that end, the Treasury Department would limit executive compensation for institutions receiving “exceptional assistance.”

“With the first half of the rescue plan now committed,” Mr. Summers wrote, “President-elect Obama believes the need is imminent and urgent. We cannot afford to wait.”

Mr. Bush’s request is certain to spark furious debate in Congress and could lead to an unpredictable series of events. Under the bailout law approved in October, the House and Senate could vote to block the money. If they do so, the president could veto that disapproval, setting up a potential override vote.

But if Congress disapproves, it is not clear who will be president and in a position to issue the veto. And even if Mr. Bush vetoed the disapproval, it would almost certainly fall to Mr. Obama to fight against a veto override.

Congressional leaders said they expect the Senate, which seems more likely to approve the money, to vote by the end of this week. If either chamber in Congress approves the funds, the money will flow.

Even lawmakers who say they could be convinced to release the money are demanding written assurances from Mr. Obama that his administration will impose new oversight and controls on how the money is spent.

Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has drafted legislation that would impose those controls and would also require at least $40 billion of the new money to be used for home foreclosure prevention efforts. The House is expected to vote to approve the bill this week.

Aides to Mr. Obama have already begun lobbying lawmakers to release the money. But some, including the House minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, have already said that will try to block more money for the bailout.

Mr. Bush’s request comes as Mr. Obama and his team are also moving aggressively to hash out the details of a nearly $800 billion economic recovery plan.

Securing the remaining $350 billion now would put the money in place for use by the new administration shortly after Mr. Obama is inaugurated, and it would spare him a potentially messy legislative fight that could interfere with his agenda.

The first $350 billion in bailout money has been fully allocated and the Treasury says there is no urgent need for more, though officials have warned that further steps are likely to be needed to stabilize the financial system.

It remains unclear if there is a need to rush to release the money, or if the Obama transition team is just seeking to avoid what could become a major headache.

Mr. Boehner of Ohio, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would oppose disbursing the money because there was no justification for doing so now.

“I think until there is a demonstrated need in our economy and a plan to address that need, I think it would be irresponsible of Congress to release the additional money,” Mr. Boehner said.

Mr. Bush’s request is expected to be accompanied by a forceful effort by Mr. Obama’s team to persuade lawmakers that the new administration will make better use of the bailout money, including new home foreclosure prevention efforts and restrictions on banks that get aid.

According to the letter written by Mr. Summers, those receiving “exceptional assistance” would be subject to “tough but sensible conditions that limit executive compensation until taxpayer money is paid back, ban dividend payments beyond de miminis amounts and put limits on buybacks and the acquisition of already financially strong companies.”

New policies would also ensure that the funds would restart lending for small businesses, auto loans and municipalities; strengthen oversight of financial institutions and work more closer with the G-8 and G-20 to ensure international coordination on recovery, financial and regulatory policies; and restructure bankruptcy laws and strengthen homeowner initiatives.
387 2009-01-13 A bad day on Wall Street was an even worse one for America’s largest banks.

Shares of Citigroup fell 17 percent on Monday as investors reacted to reports that the bank was trying to sell its prized brokerage house. Bank of America fell 12 percent and Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase all finished lower than the wider stock market, which fell about 2 percent.

The Dow Jones industrial average slid 125.21 points, or 1.46 percent, to finish at 8,473.97 while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 20.09 points, or 2.26 percent, to 870.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 32.80 points, or 2.09 percent, to 1,538.79.

The losses occurred as investors braced for what is likely to be a grim earnings season. The aluminum maker Alcoa, which fell 6.9 percent on Monday to close at $10.06 a share, announced after the markets closed that it lost $1.19 billion in the quarter, partly because of lower metals prices.

Companies including Wal-Mart and Intel have issued earnings warnings and lowered their outlooks for this year.

“Everyone accepts that the fourth-quarter earnings are going to be miserable — that’s a given,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “Really, what has investors nervous is, where are we going to create demand globally? How are we going to create traction in the global economy?”
388 2009-01-13 IS IT REAL? Not until its official global introduction occurs in March at the Geneva auto show. The bread-and-butter sedan in the Mercedes-Benz lineup was unofficially introduced in Detroit at an off-site — but on-the-record — unveiling. This was done to take advantage of the motoring press herd gathered at the Detroit show, without jeopardizing Geneva’s bragging rights to call it a global debut.

WHAT THEY SAID “With more than 20 new or further technical developments, this saloon further consolidates the leading position of Mercedes-Benz in the luxury class,” the press materials said (using the European word for sedan,” not a drinking establishment on wheels).

WHAT THEY DIDN’T SAY Though still a luxury class powerhouse, Mercedes is feeling the heat from the competition, particularly BMW, Audi and Lexus. This E-Class needs to put to rest past issues with reliability and unimpressive fuel economy.

WHAT MAKES IT TICK? When it goes on sale in the United States, only two engines will be initially available: a 268-horsepower V-6 in the E350 and a V-8 with 382 horsepower in the E550. In other markets buyers will also be able to choose from a wide range of 4 and 6-cylinder diesels.

HOW MUCH, HOW SOON? Pricing is an unlisted number until it goes on sale this spring in Europe and this summer in the United States. A 50-state-legal E350 Bluetec diesel arrives next year and the E63 V-8 screamer will break cover late in 2009. Overall, expect to shell out a bit more than the current base price range of $52,500-$89,000.

HOW’S IT LOOK? The grille evokes the sleek ConceptFascination wagon shown recently; the rest is disconcertingly Lexuslike.

391 2009-01-13 Drivers over 70 are keeping their licenses longer and driving more than earlier generations, a trend that has led to dire predictions about car accident risks for aging baby boomers.

But new research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety should ease those fears. It shows that fatal car accidents involving older drivers have actually declined markedly in the past decade.

“It’s not what people had expected to see,” said Anne T. McCartt, senior vice president for research at the insurance institute. “There were some studies, including our own research, that had predicted older driver crashes would become a bigger and bigger problem.”

Compared with middle-age drivers (ages 35 to 54), drivers 75 or older have far higher death rates per mile traveled. (So do drivers under 20.) Death rates jump markedly after age 80. But that does not necessarily mean that older people are worse drivers or that they are far more likely to crash.

Car fatalities involving young people are almost entirely explained by the fact that they have more accidents than experienced drivers. But while crash rates are slightly higher for older people, most of their increased risk for a fatal car accident is explained by the fact that they tend to be more frail. Older drivers are more likely to suffer a severe injury, particularly to the chest, or other medical complications.

414 2009-01-14 Two Queens hospitals are facing bankruptcy and may close by February, the Queens borough president said Tuesday, in one of the first indications that New York State’s budget shortfall is hurting the hospital industry.

The two private hospitals, St. John’s Queens and Mary Immaculate, had sometimes been given millions of dollars in state subsidies just to meet their payrolls, according to other hospital officials who have been briefed on the matter. But with the state facing a $15 billion budget gap, the state was less likely to help hospitals that had limited long-term viability.

Helen M. Marshall, the Queens borough president, said in her State of the Borough speech Tuesday that she was “extremely concerned today about the stability” of the two hospitals. Her spokesman, Dan Andrews, said later that Ms. Marshall had learned from officials at Caritas, which runs the two hospitals, that St. John’s and Mary Immaculate could file for bankruptcy this month and could close by next month. He said she has appealed to the governor’s office for help, and chose to mention the hospitals in her speech just hours before delivering it.

Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said Tuesday that he was concerned that these could be the first of several hospital casualties of the bad economy. “I am worried that this is a precursor of things to come,” he said. Mr. Raske added that he did not think Ms. Marshall’s warning was a political ploy aimed at building public support for the hospitals. “I think this is a hard dose of reality,” he said.

But Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department, said that the hospitals’ problems had more to do with their sustainability than with the state’s fiscal crisis. She said that the state had done its best to help them survive, extending a total of $44 million in loans and grants to the two Caritas hospitals over the last two years. “It wasn’t meant to be a permanent source of funding,” she said, adding that “we don’t have any pending loan applications from them.”
415 2009-01-14 Block trades are back. In just the last week, Bank of America dumped $2.8 billion worth of its shares in China Construction Bank. And Li Ka-shing, the Chinese billionaire, sold a $500 million chunk in Bank of China. It’s easy to see why these fast and risky trades are back in vogue.

The trades occur when an institution wants to sell a large amount of stock — and fast. The holder sells the shares to an investment bank, usually at a fixed price. The bank then tries to immediately sell the shares on the market at a premium to the price it paid.

The Chinese sales are being driven primarily by the expiration of lockups that prevented sales from taking place sooner. Western banks that made big investments are eager to cash in some of their winnings and shore up their balance sheets. The current crop of trades may be mostly China-related, but the need for cash is global. And selling large blocks of stock that is unwanted, or at least nonstrategic, is a favorable means of raising it.

Yet investment banks have been burned badly by this practice in the past. The market price for shares can quickly drop once news of a large overhang of unwanted stock gets out. Banks that buy blocks of stock at too small a discount can end up with a huge loss. For example, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank took losses that exceeded $100 million each on a block of Vivendi Universal stock in 2002.

Now, less competition means equity capital markets desks are under reduced pressure to buy the stock at an insufficient discount. Banks used to buy blocks at less than a 5 percent discount, but now it is as high as 12 percent. That’s because many of the banks that used to participate have simply disappeared, leaving the field open for Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman and others.
416 2009-01-14 We’re sure that he isn’t enjoying it, but Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is offering statehouses across the nation a needed lesson in “pay-to-play” contamination. Mr. Richardson backed away from the chance to run the Commerce Department as federal prosecutors investigate whether his aides steered a lucrative state contract to a generous political donor.

The governor proclaimed his innocence while conceding the inquiry would be too much of a distraction from the Obama administration’s opening months. (Neither he nor the Obama team explained why the investigation — which has been going on for months — is more of a distraction now than when Mr. Richardson was first interviewed for the job.)

Pay-to-play is a staple of bad government. Proving an actual quid pro quo that can be prosecuted can be difficult, especially under porous state laws. But appearances — the fawning recipient, the deep-pocketed donor — taint all politicians. And pleas of “I didn’t know,” or “everyone else does it” aren’t fit for middle-schoolers let alone elected leaders.

What’s needed is some courage in statehouses to fix the shoddy campaign-finance rules and laissez-faire lobbying privileges and impose bans on “fact-finding” junkets and other “honest graft” for legislators. Clear rules would remove any doubt, and any temptation.

In Massachusetts, a public integrity task force just issued a sweeping plan to fix the state’s toothless lobbying and conflict-of-interest laws. Sure enough, one state lawmaker, caught up in ethics allegations, is already arguing that the Legislature doesn’t have the time, given the ballooning budget deficit — as if responsible politicians can’t walk and chew gum in the same session.

Of course, the most brazen episode of pay-to-play of late is Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois. He is charged with trying to auction off the United States Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. The now-impeached governor wound up arrested, begging for someone to take the seat off his hands for nothing — with the rest of us shuddering at the spectacle.
417 2009-01-14 This year, he is introducing a bill with a motor-fuel surcharge of 8 cents a gallon. He was persuaded to change his stance, he said, because of the urgent needs of Illinois roads and highways.

State lawmakers clearly see an opportunity to push through a tax. The recent sharp drop in gasoline prices, to less than half of last summer’s high of more than $4 a gallon, means that drivers may be less hesitant to pay slightly higher prices.

For states, acute revenue shortfalls, combined with years of rising construction costs and a backlog of projects, are forcing difficult choices between raising taxes or imposing drastic cuts.

“Do you cut snowplowing? Do you cut salting roads? Do you cut maintaining and fixing bridges?” asked Representative David B. Campbell, of New Hampshire, vice chairman of the House Public Works and Highways Committee. He is introducing a bill to raise the state gasoline tax by 15 cents a gallon over three years, which would help close what he says could become a cumulative $1 billion hole in the state Transportation Department’s budget over 10 years. The gasoline tax in New Hampshire has not been raised since 1991.

As of last October, the average state tax was 30 cents a gallon, led by California at 48.7 cents, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

The federal government also takes a flat 18.4 cents at the pump, a number that has not budged in essentially 16 years. The National Commission on Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing, a federal group that analyzes future highway and transit needs, is expected soon to release a report to Congress that includes a recommendation to raise the federal gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon. It also will recommend raising the federal tax on diesel fuel. (States have diesel fuel taxes as well.)

Half of highway funds for states come from state and federal gasoline tax revenues, according to a pending National Governors Association report. (The federal tax is routed through the federal Highway Trust Fund, with about 20 percent of that going to mass transit.) The rest of state highway funds come from a variety of sources, like tolls, vehicle registration fees, bonds and general funds. Compounding the budget problems for states is the fact that people are driving less, in large part because of the weakening economy and last year’s high gasoline prices. Last October, Americans traveled 3.5 percent fewer miles, on average, compared with a year earlier, according to the federal Department of Transportation.

When people drive less, and buy fuel-efficient cars like the Toyota Prius, they buy less gas, causing gas-tax revenues to fall. In Georgia, for example, motor fuel tax revenues fell 10.4 percent, or $8.8 million, in December 2008 compared with a year earlier.

Even the federal government has been left short of highway funds. Last fall, Congress provided $8 billion in emergency funds to the Highway Trust Fund, which distributes federal gas tax revenue to the states, because of rising costs and shrinking revenue as Americans drove less.

States are hoping that President-elect Barack Obama will make good on his promise of huge stimulus spending on roads and bridges. Many states have already submitted wish lists.

In California, both Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and Democratic lawmakers are prepared to raise the gasoline tax, last directly raised in 1994. But they disagree on the means. The governor’s proposal would indirectly raise the tax as part of an overall sales tax increase, for an effective gasoline tax rise of about 3 cents a gallon (which could later rise if fuel prices rise). The proposal by the Democrats, recently rejected by Governor Schwarzenegger, would change the structure of gasoline taxes and result in an increase of 8 to 9 cents a gallon.

“It is the first time anybody has talked about this in some time,” said John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, based in Sacramento.

In Massachusetts, which still needs to pay off debt from Boston’s Big Dig, a debate is under way over whether to impose higher tolls, which Gov. Deval Patrick has said he was willing to support, or higher gasoline taxes, which some state lawmakers are discussing. Governor Patrick has also indicated that he is conditionally open to supporting an increase in gasoline taxes.

Naturally, legislators proposing higher gas taxes are certain to face some opposition. “One of the biggest economic drivers for New Hampshire is tourism, and we feel this may have a negative impact,” said Timothy G. Sink, president of the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce.

He is worried that gas prices could rise again, so the tax would just add to the driver’s burden. “Who’s got the crystal ball to tell us what’s going to happen in the next two years?” he said. The chamber has not taken an official position on the tax, he said.

And with the advent of more fuel-efficient vehicles — including hybrids and all-electric cars that some automakers are now promising to bring to market — some states are rethinking the traditional gas tax. North Carolina and Ohio, among others, are starting to consider the concept of a tax on “vehicle miles traveled.” That system has been tried on a small pilot scale in the Portland, Ore., area, but has never been tried on a large scale.
418 2009-01-14 Even some of the bailout program’s harshest critics acknowledge that things most likely would be even worse without it, and that the bailout had accomplished its most important goal, which was to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.

Since last September, no major banks have failed and the credit markets have thawed somewhat.

But analysts said the problems are still acute, if less apparent on the surface. Banks have received $200 billion in fresh capital from the Treasury since last fall and have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars more from the Fed. But in the meantime, the economy fell into a severe downturn last fall that is likely to continue until at least this summer.

Industry analysts estimate rising unemployment and business failures will lead to another $500 billion to $750 billion of losses in coming months. That could bring total losses from the credit crisis to $1.5 trillion to $1.8 trillion, twice as high as earlier estimates.

Citigroup is not alone. , , and most other big banks all expect enormous losses as millions of consumers default on their mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans. Other losses are expected on loans made to commercial real estate developers, small businesses and for highly leveraged corporate buyout deals.

Mr. Bernanke bluntly warned on Tuesday that the government would probably have to infuse more money into financial institutions in the months ahead.

“More capital injections and guarantees may become necessary to ensure stability and the normalization of credit markets,” Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the London School of Economics.

Mr. Bernanke, tacitly acknowledging the unpopularity of the bailout program, said the public was “understandably concerned” about pouring hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into financial companies — especially when other industries were getting the cold shoulder.

But, he insisted, there was no escape. “This disparate treatment, unappealing as it is, appears unavoidable,” Mr. Bernanke said. “Our economic system is critically dependent on the free flow of credit.”

Mr. Obama and his economic team have assured Congress that they would use a sizable chunk of the new money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to help distressed homeowners refinance mortgages and escape foreclosure. That would be a big shift from the Bush administration, which refused to use TARP for reducing foreclosures.

, Mr. Obama’s choice to head the White House National Economic Council, assured Democratic lawmakers in writing on Monday that the administration would use some of the money to help reduce foreclosures.

But Mr. Bernanke appears to be warning Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats that most of the remaining $350 billion — and possibly more — has to go to shoring up banks if they are to resume lending at normal levels.

During the first three quarters of 2008, banks were able to raise enough capital to offset more than their hundreds of billions in losses by tapping the giant government bailout fund as well as some early private investors.

But that was only a stopgap.

“The capital raises finally caught up with the losses,” said Michael Zeltkevic, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm specializing in the finance industry. “It doesn’t make the situation better, but at least we caught up.”

The new tidal wave of losses stems from the worsening economy and rising unemployment, and analysts say it will take several quarters before it peaks.

Regulators require banks to keep a healthy cushion of capital. But this time around, the banks are struggling to plug their deepening holes. Private investors are scarce. For all but a small group of healthy banks, bankers and analysts say, the government may be the only investor left.

“Most banks are going to be in a defensive posture,” said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner with Institutional Risk Analytics. “You are probably not going to see the industry expand its overall balance sheet until 2010 or 2011.”

Mr. Obama’s economic team is planning a broad overhaul of the program to impose more accountability and more restrictions on executives at companies that receive government money.

Policy makers are also looking at reviving the original idea of TARP — have Treasury buy up unsalable mortgage-backed securities from financial entities.

, the Treasury secretary, had dropped the idea, concluding it would be more efficient to inject capital directly into banks by buying preferred shares.

Mr. Bernanke revived the idea, along with several other approaches, in his speech in . So did Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a hearing on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee. He suggested the Treasury could buy the unwanted securities directly, or set up special banks to buy them.

Some analysts, even those who agree that the government needs to prop up the banking system with more taxpayer money, were skeptical about TARP.

Adam S. Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the Bush administration had been right to inject capital into banks but wrong in not pushing banks hard enough to fix their problems or accounting.

“The problem isn’t that we’ve wasted money,” Mr. Posen said. “The problem is that we’ve put too few conditions on the banks.”
419 2009-01-14 After Mr. Montejo was assigned the lawyer, police detectives urged him to write a letter to the victim’s widow, and provided him pen and paper. The letter, expressing remorse and asking for forgiveness, was used against Mr. Montejo at his trial. He was convicted and sentenced to death.

A decision in the case, Montejo v. Louisiana, No. 07-1529, is expected by June.

A second case argued Tuesday was billed in the briefs as “a first in the history of American jurisprudence.” At the beginning of her argument, Christina Rainville, a chief deputy state’s attorney for Vermont, said the case held the seeds of “chaos of constitutional proportions.”

But after an hour of argument, the case, Vermont v. Brillon, No. 08-88, seemed most likely to lead to a narrow ruling based on its exceptionally tangled facts.

In March, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that a three-year delay in bringing Michael Brillon to trial, for domestic assault as a habitual offender, had violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding that the delays in the case had been caused by Mr. Brillon or his appointed lawyers.

The general rule is that the right to a speedy trial does not apply to self-inflicted delays. The State Supreme Court acknowledged that, but it said the inaction of assigned counsel should count against the state and not the defendant. That proposition, if applied to overburdened and underfinanced public defender offices around the nation, could indeed have broad consequences.

But the argument on Tuesday focused largely on Mr. Brillon’s complicated interactions with a parade of lawyers, some of whom he fired or threatened.

Lawyers for the state conceded that “it is theoretically conceivable that a systemic underfunding of the program for appointing defense counsel could create a constitutionally cognizable issue if speedy trial violations were occurring in case after case.”

Justice David H. Souter summarized where all this left the court.

“There is plenty of blame to go around,” Justice Souter said. “It seems to me that there isn’t an issue of principle dividing the parties here. It’s a series of issues of details.”

The third case argued Tuesday, Knowles v. Mirzayance, No. 07-1315, also seemed unlikely to generate a clean legal ruling. The defendant in the case, Alexandre Mirzayance, accused his former lawyer of having failed to present what he said was his only viable defense after his conviction of first-degree murder: that of not guilty by reason of insanity.

California state courts ruled that the lawyer’s choice was a reasonable one, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, disagreed.

Steven E. Mercer, a deputy state attorney general, said that “the Ninth Circuit has come at this matter with a chestful of monkey wrenches.” Several justices indicated that they were not inclined to second-guess the lawyer or the state courts.
420 2009-01-14 WASHINGTON—President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Julius Genachowski, an adviser on technology issues and a longtime friend, to become the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, advisers to Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Genachowski, 46, played a leading role in the Obama campaign’s highly successful online strategy and was a major fundraiser for the campaign. He and Mr. Obama both attended Columbia, though they were in different classes. They became friendly at Harvard Law School, where they both served in top positions at the Harvard Law Review . They have also been basketball buddies.

During the campaign Mr. Genachowski shaped many of Mr. Obama’s telecommunications and technology policies. He advocated an open Internet in the debate over so-called net neutrality, and media ownership rules that promoted a diversity of voices on the airwaves.

While it is difficult to predict what direction Mr. Genachowski will take the commission, an analysis by Stifel Nicolaus, an investment firm, said that it expected that “the regulatory initiative is likely to shift” away from some from incumbent — like the large telephone companies — to new entrants and other “nontraditional telecom and media players” including such companies as Google, Yahoo and eBay.

It speculated that Mr. Genachowski would seek to spur competition among the wireless carriers as a counterbalance to the dominance of the telephone and cable companies. And it said that Mr. Genachowski is unlikely to be as aggressive in his approach to regulating the cable industry as the current chairman, Kevin J. Martin, has been.

Mr. Martin has not set a departure date, although he is widely expected to step down soon. If he leaves before Mr. Genachowski’s confirmation, then Mr. Obama is expected to name one of the two remaining Democratic commissioners — Michael J. Copps or Jonathan S. Adelstein — as interim chairman.
421 2009-01-14 He said buyers can still get a 20-game package for $7,000 a seat.

“It’s obtainable,” he said. “In this economic time, people are still looking for things to take their children or grandchildren to.”

Sroka said the company will send targeted mailings to prospective customers and create special events, including one at the Super Bowl, to promote the seats and suites.

“Just like everything else, in different economic times, they probably wouldn’t have needed our help,” Sroka said. He added, “We believe we can add value to what they’re doing.” His firm is receiving a consulting fee from the Yankees.

Jim Grinstead, the editor and publisher of Revenues From Sports Venues, an industry newsletter, said he had never heard of real estate brokers marketing premium seating.

“The Yankees are tapping into a constituency to which real estate agents have better access than Yankee executives do,” he said. “It’s an interesting play. When people talk about pricing seats in stadiums and arenas, the phrase is ‘location is everything.’ ”

With the new Yankee Stadium and the Mets’ Citi Field scheduled to open in April, both teams say tickets are selling well despite the woeful economy and some higher prices. Each team hopes their gilded homes and new acquisitions (like C. C. Sabathia and Mark Teixeira by the Yankees and Francisco Rodríguez by the Mets) will buoy interest and attendance during the deepest recession in decades.

The Mets said Tuesday they have sold just under 2 million out of a maximum 3.4 million at Citi Field, ahead of the pace for last year’s final season at Shea Stadium.

The team expected to sell more than 3 million tickets at the 45,000-seat stadium.

“The general trend is very good,” said David Howard, the Mets’ executive vice president for business operations. “The interest and demand are there, but people are definitely shopping price. It’s a difficult environment, but we think we’ll come close to achieving our goal over all. We’re still optimistic because we have a compelling product.”

At the Yankees’ 52,325-seat stadium, the team has sold 24,564 full season-ticket packages, up from 19,400 last year. By combining full and partial packages, the team said it has sold the equivalent of 39,393 full season tickets.

A comparable figure for 2008 was not available.

Both teams said they have not lowered any prices to accommodate the sour economy or those fans who have to pay more to have tickets that are equivalent to where they sat at the old stadiums.

Richie Brown of Manhattan downgraded his location at the new Yankee Stadium to pay about what he paid last year, $220 a seat — rather than triple his cost to $650. But he would rather have kept his field-level seats.

“What they should have done is like rent stabilization for people like me who’ve been here for more than 25 years,” he said. “You get marginal increases every year.”

David Epstein, a longtime buyer of a Saturdays-only Mets package of 13 games, accepted a 15-game package (including 10 Saturdays) that took him from a loge box near home plate to left field.

“I’m not satisfied at all,” said Epstein, an NBC executive who was upset that he did not get priority location after 24 years at Shea.

The Mets waited until December to start selling partial season-ticket packages to existing ticket holders after determining what was available after full season-ticket holders had renewed their plans. Howard said the delay upset partial season-ticket holders “because we couldn’t give them definitive answers.”

The Mets are planning to start selling partial season-ticket packages to the public this week, with the sale to incumbents nearly over.

Nick Ragone, a writer and lawyer from Jersey City, is paying $110 a ticket at Citi Field, double what he paid last season, as part of a group that will watch the Mets.

“They’d better be twice as good,” he said.
422 2009-01-14 As of Tuesday, 257 financial institutions in 42 states had received $192 billion in capital injections from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, out of $250 billion set aside for this purpose. Seven giant banks — like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup — have received more than 62 percent of the total so far, and have gotten most of the attention.

But it is the smaller community banks like Independent that are seeing the largest number of investments, with 186 banks so far getting allocations of less than $100 million. With little public attention, this money in recent weeks has been streaming out to community banks across the nation, in dollops as small as $1 million — the amount set aside for Independent Bank of East Greenwich, R.I. Ultimately, more than 1,000 banks are expected to take part in the program.

While most of the banks that have received money appear to be relatively healthy, dozens of other banks that received federal funds are, like Independent Bank of Michigan, financially stressed by a high volume of delinquent loans.

Economists say the decision by banks like Independent to use the federal money for purposes other than lending, while perhaps disappointing, is not surprising, given that the Treasury Department did not honor its plan to give the money only to healthy banks.

“It’s a matter of logic — when you are in a perilous position, like many of them are, you try to bolster your balance sheet,” said Alan S. Blinder, a monetary policy economics professor at Princeton. “But this is a real flaw in the program.”

Some banking experts are even questioning if the bailout may be doing more harm than good, in some cases, by giving banks like Independent a cushion as they struggle to fix their problems, rather than forcing them to sink or swim on their own. It could also delay mergers of weaker banks with healthier ones.

“You are keeping a lot of troubled institutions in kind of a status quo state,” said Eric D. Hovde, the chief executive of a Washington-based hedge fund that invests in the banking industry. “They can continue on their merry ways.” In Congress, anger over the management of the TARP program runs deep. Many lawmakers say that there is little oversight, and that they can see no evidence that the taxpayer money is making its way from the coffers of banks to businesses and consumers. The program is likely to be fundamentally changed under the administration of Barack Obama, who on Monday asked President Bush to request that Congress release the remaining $350 billion.

Some lawmakers have criticized the Treasury for allowing banks to use the government’s bailout money to acquire rival banks.

As additional evidence of the growing anxiety, bank regulators on Monday sent a notice to banks receiving federal money ordering them to disclose how they are using it. It also pushed them to emphasize new loans. “A lot of the money is already out there and the inspector general needs to get up to speed on how banks are using it,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. “We need to make sure we get this money back and the only way we can do that is with strong oversight on how this money is spent.”

Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant secretary at Treasury running the bailout program, said he was convinced that it was delivering the promised results by stabilizing banks while also encouraging them to help out their communities. Even if overall lending is not up, it is higher than it would have been without the program, he said.

“We’re still in a period of fairly low confidence,” he said. “So, banks are understandably nervous about extending a lot of new credit. And consumers are nervous about taking on new credit.”

Independent, which has 106 branches and $3.1 billion in assets, illustrates all of these complexities.

By no means is Independent the worst off among the country’s community banks. Some banks that sought TARP funds were considered so weak that Washington officials discouraged them from even applying. Other banks were rated slightly stronger but still were required to raise private capital before they were approved for federal help.

When it applied, Independent was considered “well capitalized” by federal standards. It had not been subject to any recent regulatory orders to change management or lending practices, for example.

But it was struggling nonetheless. Indeed, of all the banks that received bailout money as of Jan. 6, it had the second-highest ratio of bad loans, when compared with its capital and its cushion of reserves in case of further loan losses. Its assets are shrinking and it lost money in the third quarter. It began cutting its dividend last year, when it stood at 21 cents a share. It is now a penny a share. And it had lost millions of dollars from bad stock market investments.

But Independent is hardly a high roller plagued by gold-plated executive perks, and it was not a big subprime lender, as many banks were.

Based in Ionia, Mich., 30 miles east of Grand Rapids, it is the kind of local institution that foots the bill so the state’s high school bands can march in the annual Grand Rapids Santa Claus Parade. This month it has George Foreman grills stacked up in its lobbies to reward customers who bring in friends and neighbors to open new accounts. Independent is one of the biggest employers in Ionia, a city of 10,000 with classic, turn-of-the-century storefronts dominating its main street. Driving across suburban Detroit in his black Mercedes sedan, Keith Lightbody, a senior vice president at Independent Bank, said it was easy, in retrospect, to see how banks like his ended up where they are today.

Mr. Lightbody, a former JPMorgan Chase bank executive hired almost two years ago by Independent, tours the sites of the bank’s many broken dreams, like the Whispering Woods residential subdivision in Farmington Hills. The bank financed the construction of roads and utilities for the subdivision, only to see the developer go belly up before most of the lots were sold. Snowdrifts now nearly cover the “for sale” signs.

Perhaps even more distressing are the empty storefronts in Shelby Township, Mich., where a developer backed by the bank built what was supposed to be a vibrant streetscape, bustling with shops and shoppers.

Instead, other than a restaurant at the front of the complex, there is only a row of darkened windows, with the work halted on the would-be stores even before their floors were built, leaving the insides looking like a sandbox filled with random construction debris.

As of the end of September, the bank was burdened by $115 million in bad debts, or nearly 5 percent of its overall loan portfolio, compared with less than 1 percent in 2005. Each of these failed projects has something essential in common, Mr. Lightbody said.

“We didn’t step back and look at the big picture, asking ourselves, are we really doing the right thing with this loan?” he said. “Everyone was making a lot of money.”

Independent is publicly traded and under pressure from investors to shrink its troubled loan portfolio before lending anew. Yet it still very much wants to make loans, said Robert N. Shuster, Independent’s chief financial officer.

In normal times, Independent would lend up to $8 for every $1 in bank capital. The $72 million in federal money, therefore, could generate up to $576 million in loans — a powerful leveraging effect that was the goal of the TARP program.

“Our whole business is predicated on making loans — that is what we do, that is the mission of the bank,” he said. But the bank cannot afford to simply pass out money, Mr. Shuster said, or everyone involved will lose — the borrower, who would probably default on the loan; the bank, which would experience bigger losses; and the federal government, which is counting on Independent to pay back the $72 million, along with 5 percent dividend payments.

“That is what got us where we are today,” Mr. Shuster said, of the bank’s past easy-lending practices. “You can’t put consumers in a position where they aren’t going to be successful.”

Ms. Kimball, the chief lending officer, comes face to face with this debate each day.

She has continued to tighten lending standards, generally turning away applications, for example, for single-use commercial buildings, like restaurants, because of the difficulty in selling the properties if the bank needed to foreclose on the loan, she said. Independent is also taking a more critical look at appraisals submitted to justify housing loans, which is considered a necessity now, because national companies that buy up mortgages from banks like Independent are demanding such scrutiny.

“We are not going to lower our credit standards at this point to make a whole bunch of extra loans just to deploy the money,” Ms. Kimball said. “We need to make loans that are reasonable in this day and age.”

Working from the Troy office, Ms. Kimball, who has a cool, stern tone, and a self-confidence that comes from 25 years in the financial services business, is overseeing this effort as the bank moves, in particular, to cut the size of its real estate loan portfolio.

“It is not something that changes overnight,” she said from her corner office overlooking Troy. “It is like turning a ship around in the ocean.”

She knows many of the bank’s big commercial borrowers personally — taking the time to go out on the road and visit their factories or businesses to get a better sense of just how well positioned they are to repay their loans.

One manufacturer from western Michigan, a customer of another bank, came to Independent looking for a business loan. Her examination of the company’s books showed that its sales were slipping and, worse, that it was having a hard time collecting on bills it had sent to its remaining customers, who also were suffering from the economic downturn.

So the bank had to make the hard choice of turning the company down.

“That is just not something we can do,” Mr. Shuster said, declining to name the company. “We just can’t lend there.”

With the tighter lending standards and the damage the miserable Michigan economy has done to so many of its businesses, the pool of eligible borrowers has shrunk considerably. The net result is that the overall balance of outstanding commercial loans the bank carries — which was about $1 billion as of last June — has shrunk by $50 million and will most likely continue to shrink through much of the first half of this year, Ms. Kimball said.

There are, of course, exceptions.

Ultimate Hydroforming of Sterling Heights, Mich., which makes prototypes for the aviation and automobile industry, like the battery casing for the new Chevrolet Volt, a planned electric car, has been able to obtain new credit recently and will probably get even more from Independent.

The company’s manufacturing plant is only a few miles from a half-dozen giant automobile assembly plants. But Ultimate Hydroforming had started several years ago to look for ways to diversify, so its business is still growing, even as the automobile industry goes into a deep slump.

Ms. Kimball, on a recent visit, was greeted by the plant operations manager, Shane Klyn, and then given a tour of the factory, which is installing towering new hydraulic presses — thanks to loans from Independent — as part of an expansion that it hopes will lead the company into profitable work making parts for solar energy devices.

“This will allow us to move into new projects and markets,” Mr. Klyn said as he walked through the plant with Ms. Kimball, who by then had a big smile on her face, despite the freezing winds and piles of snow just outside. “The bank is giving us the opportunity to expand.”

But companies like Ultimate Hydroforming are extremely hard to find, particularly in Michigan, where the unemployment rate is far above the national average.

With no surge in lending taking place right away — and the bank very much looking for a way to improve its own balance sheet — Independent took the $72 million check that arrived from Treasury in mid-December and immediately transferred it to the Federal Reserve to pay down short-term loans it had taken out.

This month, the bank is planning to leverage that bailout money to buy about $160 million in mortgage-backed securities from institutions like Fannie Mae, an investment that it hopes will produce enough interest income to pay the dividend it owes the federal government. Again, this will bring little immediate benefit to Michigan businesses and residents. In essence, the $72 million has been stuffed into Treasury’s own mattress.

Mr. Hovde, the hedge fund investor who says he believes the bailout program is putting off judgment day for many banks, said his fear was that many of the banks would burn through their federal money only to face a squeeze again. And they will never have made the extra loans that the Treasury had hoped would jump-start the economy.

Treasury officials remain confident that the investments are wise ones.

“There’s going to be more lending than had we not done this,” Mr. Kashkari said. “Even if the overall numbers are down year-over-year, it’s going to be a lot more than if we had not put the capital in the system.”

And Mr. Shuster, back in Michigan, said he was determined to prove that Mr. Kashkari — whom he has never spoken to or met — is right.

“Even if things get tougher, I am confident we can work our way through this and pay every dime back to the U.S. Treasury,” he said. “There is no stone we won’t turn over to make sure we are good stewards of this money. We feel an enormous responsibility to this Treasury. I am a taxpayer too.”
423 2009-01-14 Gov. David A. Paterson nominated Justice Jonathan Lippman on Tuesday to be the next chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.

Justice Lippman, 63, the presiding justice of the First Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, one of the state’s midlevel appeals courts, is expected to be introduced at a news conference in Albany on Wednesday.

Despite the nomination, Mr. Paterson renewed his criticism of the selection process.

The Commission on Judicial Nomination gave Mr. Paterson a list of seven male candidates last month, and the governor was required to select one of them to replace Judith S. Kaye, who was the first woman on the Court of Appeals and the first female chief judge..

“Though I am thrilled to choose Judge Lippman to serve as our next chief judge, I firmly believe that we must revise the process for future judicial nominations to ensure that those under consideration represent all New Yorkers,” the governor said on Tuesday. “That is why I will propose revising the judicial nomination statute.”

The selection process was also criticized by State Senator John L. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said he would hold hearings concerning the criteria used by the commission in its selection process.
424 2009-01-14 WASHINGTON  It is true, President Bush sounded alarms about Barack Obama during the campaign season. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush went one step further: He declared Mr. Obama’s inauguration an actual emergency.

The declaration, though, was not a political statement about Republicans being run out of town. Rather, it was a bureaucratic move intended to provide additional federal money to help Washington cope with the huge crowds that are expected to turn out for the ceremony next Tuesday that will make Mr. Obama the nation’s first black president.

The government has set aside $15 million to help pay for security and medical personnel. But Mayor Adrian M. Fenty asked for more money, citing possible crowds of 1.5 million to 2 million and “the associated stresses that it would place on the city’s capabilities, particularly the medical community,” said Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.

Mr. Bush granted the request as “a precaution,” Mr. Stanzel said; if Washington needs the money, it can apply for reimbursement through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The declaration will also allow federal public health workers to join in the public safety effort.

The president’s power to declare a state of emergency is typically used after natural disasters, although Mr. Stanzel said presidents had occasionally declared emergencies before an anticipated event. But never before, he said, has an advance declaration been used for a “non-disaster.”
425 2009-01-14 HARPERSVILLE, Ala. (AP) A 38-year-old businessman and pilot who apparently tried to fake his death in a plane crash on Sunday was arrested on Tuesday in north Florida, the authorities said.

The businessman, Marcus Schrenker, an Indiana investment adviser, secretly parachuted to the ground and speeded away on a motorcycle he had stashed away in the pine barrens of central Alabama, officials say.

Mr. Schrenker was found alive about 10 p.m. in a tent at a campground in Quincy after he apparently slit one of his wrists, Michael Richards, a spokesman for the United States Marshals Service, said.

Mr. Schrenker was on the run not only from the law but also from divorce, a state investigation of his businesses and investors who accuse him of stealing potentially millions in savings they entrusted to him.

The events of the past few days appear to be a last, gambit by a man was about to hit bottom.

On Sunday  two days after burying his stepfather and suffering a half-million-dollar loss in federal court the same day  Mr. Schrenker was flying his single-engine Piper Malibu to Florida from his Indiana home when he radioed from 2,000 feet that he was in trouble. Then his radio went silent.

Military jets tried to intercept the plane and found the door open, the cockpit dark. The pilots followed until the aircraft crashed in a Florida bayou. There was no sign of Mr. Schrenker’s body.
426 2009-01-14 A scientific dispute has become a slander suit, in a legal case involving NMT Medical and its device for closing congenital holes in the heart.

The lawsuit, pending in London, was filed in 2007 by NMT Medical after a clinical trial failed to show that its device could eliminate migraine headaches in people with the congenital heart opening, known as a patent foramen ovale, or P.F.O.

NMT Medical contends that one of the British researchers in the study slandered and libeled it when he was quoted in an online publication as saying the trial may have failed because the product did not work well. The researcher, Dr. Peter Wilmshurst, was also quoted as saying the company had withheld trial data because it feared that it might undercut sales of the device for other uses, like stroke treatment.

“I’m not as concerned about the companies as I am about the fact that the patients who are in the studies will suffer,” Dr. Wilmshurst was quoted by the publication, theheart.org, which covers cardiology.

NMT Medical executives and another researcher involved in the trial dispute Dr. Wilmshurst’s suggestions. They say that Dr. Wilmshurst turned on them because the trial’s failure undermined his theory of a link between P.F.O. and migraine. “Everything was being completely torn to shreds by his attacks,” said John E. Ahern, the company’s chief executive. “We felt it was appropriate to protect the good name of this company and the work it does.”
427 2009-01-14 TEHRAN — Iran has tried four Iranians on charges of trying to overthrow the government with the support of the United States, a judiciary spokesman said Tuesday. He also said that two men convicted of “adultery, murder and other crimes” were executed by stoning last month in the northeastern city of Mashad.

The spokesman, Alireza Jamshidi, said a verdict and sentence for those accused of plotting against the government would come in the next few days. He said that the four men were Iranian and had been arrested in Tehran, the ISNA news agency reported.

“They attracted forces, trained them and sent them overseas,” Mr. Jamshidi said. “But they did not engage in any destructive action.”

He added, “Members of this group worked in different ways around the country and got money directly from the State Department or the C.I.A. from the budget that was approved by the U.S. Senate for overthrowing the regime.”

Mr. Jamshidi did not disclose the identity of the men or give any information on when they had been arrested and tried.
428 2009-01-14 The Internal Revenue Service is considering expanding its scrutiny of colleges and universities to focus on billions of dollars associated with academic research, federal financing and intellectual property, a senior agency official said on Tuesday.

The expansion of an investigation would put pressure on the schools to further disclose their inner financial workings as the I.R.S. undertakes a major effort to learn more about whether academic institutions are improperly using their nonprofit status to avoid paying certain taxes.

The expansion, while not yet certain, “is on the table,” Lois G. Lerner, the I.R.S.’s director of exempt organizations, said in a brief interview.

As part of its current investigation, which began last October, the I.R.S. sent unusually detailed questionnaires to 400 private and public universities and colleges about their executive compensation policies and their business activities.

While the institutions are not obligated to respond, not doing so can potentially lead to an audit.

The investigation is modeled upon similar scrutiny of hospitals that began in 2006 and has prompted audits, legislative hearings and stricter tax-filing requirements. The idea is to give the I.R.S. a clear view of how the business of academia operates in the 21st century. “Universities are really part of a rapidly evolving sector, and as sectors evolve and the economy evolves, we’re going to periodically take a hard look,” Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, said.
429 2009-01-14 The communal experience of next week’s presidential inauguration will extend beyond the Mall in Washington to include movie theaters and even coffee shops across the country.

The inauguration coverage by the cable news channel MSNBC will be projected onto movie theater screens in 21 cities next Tuesday. The channel is also planning to announce a partnership with Starbucks to simulcast its coverage in 650 of the company’s stores.

MSNBC and other news outlets are looking to capitalize on the heightened interest in the inauguration of Barack Obama, as watch parties are being planned in cities across the nation.

On Monday, a line of people encircled the American Film Institute’s theater in Silver Spring, Md., where 400 tickets were distributed for an inauguration simulcast. The institute plans to show the coverage from the TV One cable channel. Murray Horwitz, the director of the theater, said witnessing the inauguration with other people, even in a theater setting, was an appealing prospect.

“Not to sound too corny about it,” Mr. Horwitz said, “but it’s a time to come together as Americans.”
430 2009-01-14 It’s interesting that Indian and Latin American cuisines share some key flavors — tamarind, lime, cumin, chilies, mango — but not interesting enough to sustain at At Vermilion, a glossy Grand Central-area offshoot of a Chicago restaurant.

Those flavors are treated carelessly, while care is lavished on the interior. Why go to the trouble of installing a waterfall and filling reflecting pools with Gerbera daisies, while serving lamb chops burned outside and chewy in the middle ($14), and the same dull mango salsa on three different plates?

At least the menu is a great read, pulling in regional Indian spice mixtures, Puerto Rican snacks and classic Portuguese fish soups.

But fried artichoke hearts ($10), described as “Spain’s thistle in Indian fritters,” are so bland that no culinary tradition would claim them; same for wild boar “jibaritos” ($10) and duck vindaloo “arepas” ($12), each one a bland mouthful of meat atop a bland circle of starch.

A few concoctions — a whole steamed red snapper in a red broth that sings, hot flatbread brushed with melted butter and bits of fresh ginger, and hot chocolate ($10) perfectly seasoned with warm spices and chili heat — manage to translate the place’s ambitions to the plate.

But mostly it’s mystifying: when did simply slicing raw vegetables into ribbons transform them into side dishes? (Plain radish “swirls” are served with tamarind-glazed shrimp; $14). How does a kitchen make skirt steak ($25), normally the most forgiving and juicy of beef cuts, emerge from the tandoori oven as stringy and tough as Clint Eastwood?
431 2009-01-14 Intel is shifting an important advertising assignment — to create brand and corporate image campaigns — to a smaller, independent agency from a Madison Avenue giant.

Intel is hiring Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco, which works for advertisers like Audi of America and Barclays, as its lead global creative agency, replacing McCann Erickson Worldwide. Venables Bell will handle what Intel calls its master brand assignment, which involves campaigns to burnish Intel’s image rather than specific products.

The amount of money that Intel spends on master-brand ads changes from year to year. Intel has not made final decisions on its budgets for 2009, but by some estimates, master brand ads could total from $50 million to $150 million each year.

The change is part of what a spokesman for Intel, David Dickstein, described Tuesday as a shift to an “open-source” model of agency relationships, to borrow a term from technology.

That means that Intel plans to work with a panoply of agencies rather than limiting itself to the traditional model of designating an agency of record.
432 2009-01-14 Much of the great art in France may be ancient, but the audience is about to get much younger, officials hope. President Nicolas Sarkozy unveiled a plan on Tuesday that will allow all French youths under 25 and schoolteachers to enter museums free starting April 4, Agence France-Presse reported. In a speech promoting French culture in the coming year, Mr. Sarkozy also said that he would lift a partial freeze on state financing for the performing arts. He announced as well that he planned to create a new national history museum.
433 2009-01-14 Smashies, pouches of organic applesauce, may be just right for backpackers, hikers, skiers and campers. The sauce has no added sweeteners, needs no refrigeration and is kosher.

But the primary audience is the younger set. For a lunchbox treat or a snack, Smashies also do the trick. Children can easily suck out the contents of the 3.2-ounce package, and they seem to enjoy doing it. It would be better if the cap remained attached once the container is open, but the portion seems about right for a single sitting — for either child or adult.

Smashies are about $1.49 each or 10 for $9.99 at many stores, including Garden of Eden, Union Market in Brooklyn, and Mrs. Greens in Scarsdale, N.Y.
434 2009-01-14 “Slumdog Millionaire” has yet to be released in Mumbai, but that hasn’t stopped the city from celebrating. Newspaper headlines captured the city’s pride after the Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday night, when the movie, set in the gritty streets of Mumbai, took home four awards, including best dramatic film, The Associated Press reported. “The $lumdog Has Its Day,” The Times of India said. The Hindustan Times declared “Indian tale catches global fancy.” The movie was also honored with awards for its director (Danny Boyle), screenplay (by Simon Beaufoy) and original score (by the Indian composer A. R. Rahman). Mr. Rahman’s award inspired particular pride for the country and city of Mumbai, which produces more than 200 films a year, according to Subir Malik, an Indian musician. “It was brilliant,” he said. “It may sound clichéd, but it felt very good seeing Rahman winning an award and our own guys like Anil Kapoor on the same stage as Brad Pitt.” The film will be released in India on Jan. 23.
435 2009-01-14 “I embarrassed my family for the last time and by the time you read this I will be gone,” Mr. Britt quoted the message as saying. Mr. Schrenker claimed in the message that a window in the plane imploded, hitting him with glass and causing him to lose oxygen.

“Hypoxia can cause people to make terrible decisions and I simply put on my parachute and survival gear and bailed out,” he said in the message.

It was unclear on Tuesday if the authorities had declared the message authentic or not. A spokesman for the U.S. Marshal service did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Mr. Schrenker could face charges if it is determined he deliberately abandoned the plane. Mr. Schrenker had been steeped in marital and financial turmoil, and the authorities say they have reason to believe he faked his own death.

Court records show that Mr. Schrenker’s wife filed for divorce on Dec. 30. A Maryland court recently issued a judgment of more than $500,000 against one of three Indiana companies registered in his name — and all three are being investigated for securities fraud by the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, a spokesman, Jim Gavin, said.

Mr. Schrenker has at least a decade of experience as a pilot, according to the airport in Anderson, Ind., where he departed Sunday evening. But the police said that within hours of taking off, he issued a distress call.

He told air traffic controllers that he was bleeding profusely and that the windshield of his Piper PA-46 turboprop had imploded. The control tower told him to try to land nearby, but instead he “appears to have intentionally abandoned the plane after putting it on autopilot over the Birmingham, Ala., area,” the police in Santa Rosa County said.

He next appeared in Childersburg, Ala., about 30 miles to the southeast, when he approached local officers and said he had been in a canoeing accident. He was wet from the knees down and carried what the police described as “goggles that looked like they were made for ‘flying.’ ”

After checking his Indiana license, the officers drove Mr. Schrenker to a hotel. They returned after learning of the abandoned plane, but his room was empty. Surveillance footage at the hotel captured images of Mr. Schrenker carrying a large backpack and looking slightly disheveled.

Witnesses said a man believed to be Mr. Schrenker wearing a black toboggan cap had run into the woods next to the hotel. The telephones at Mr. Schrenker’s home and one of his companies, Heritage Wealth Management, have been disconnected.

His piloting skills, however, can be seen in a YouTube video in which he flies under bridges in the Bahamas. “This stunt,” it says, “should not be tried by any pilot that wishes to stay alive.”

Throughout the day Tuesday, throngs of visitors to the site posted comments under the video like, “Busted,” and “Run Forrest Run!”
436 2009-01-14 Citigroup faces a devastating fourth quarter, with expectations of a $10 billion operating loss, and potentially billions more this year. Federal regulators have been pressing Citigroup to clarify its strategy, shore up its finances and shake up its board, according to two people briefed on the situation. Government officials want the bank to close what they see as a credibility gap with investors.

The bank’s plan to accelerate a dismantling of its financial supermarket comes after a stern regulatory warning it received in late November, when its rapidly deteriorating share price prompted the government to give it a second cash infusion, of $27 billion.

That warning, according to one of the people briefed on the discussions, was delivered by Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who told Citigroup that any further requests for cash would result in a breakup of its operations dictated by regulators.

A spokesman for Ms. Bair said that the F.D.I.C. did not as a matter of course discuss confidential supervisory matters.

But by devising the breakup plan, Citigroup appears to be acknowledging the regulatory admonition, though on its own terms. The moves may also set the stage for a spinoff of a stronger company or eventual merger. A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment.

Citigroup’s first cash infusion from the government came in October in a $25 billion capital injection from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Eight other banks also received capital infusions to stabilize them as the global financial crisis deepened.

With its receipt of a second lifeline from the government in November, Citigroup began operating under what is known as open-bank assistance, which involves a loss-sharing arrangement devised by the F.D.I.C. and an investment by the Treasury typically reserved for deeply troubled institutions. Some analysts say they believe the arrangement could result in the bank selling more divisions.

Citigroup has “a new C.E.O.,” William B. Smith, a Citigroup investor who has long sought a breakup of the company, said on Tuesday. “His name is Uncle Sam, he is an activist, and he wants the company monetized.”

Mr. Smith said Citigroup was embarking on the correct strategy at the wrong time, saying that the bank missed an opportunity to whittle its unwieldy operations two years ago, when it was trading at $50 a share. On Tuesday, Citigroup’s stock closed up 5.4 percent, at $5.90.

Defining the “core” and “noncore” businesses, with separate names and management teams, may set the stage for later spinning off Citigroup’s stronger operations over time. By reporting the two sets of businesses separately, Citigroup will make it easier for its investors to focus on its underlying results. Citigroup will still have to find buyers for the troubled businesses and assets it hopes to unload — a difficult task in this market environment.

The joint venture between the Smith Barney brokerage and Morgan Stanley should help fill some of Citigroup’s capital needs by providing an immediate cash injection and a big accounting gain at a time when it is difficult to raise capital. Morgan Stanley paid $2.7 billion to own 51 percent of the new entity and can buy the rest of the business in three years for a price to be set then. The combined brokerage will include some 20,000 brokers and 1,000 retail offices.

The spinoff was the first step in a strategy that now includes whittling Citigroup’s financial supermarket into a core operation — including its global investment and consumer banking franchises as well as its private bank — and a group of noncore, loss-inducing business, according to the people close to the situation.

Those include its consumer finance operations, private-label credit card businesses and the $306 billion of illiquid assets, largely guaranteed by the government. The bank also plans to slim down its trading activities and sell off its overseas brokerage and asset management units, which no longer fit with the bank’s plans.

The formal plans will be announced Jan. 22, when Citigroup reports its fourth-quarter results.

For Citigroup, the changes draw a somber curtain over the one-stop shop created in 1998 when the company’s architect and former chief, Sanford I. Weill, merged the insurance giant Travelers Group and Citicorp, then the nation’s largest bank. The deal rewrote the rules of American finance by bringing traditional banking, insurance and Wall Street businesses, like stock underwriting, under one roof. It also ushered in a period of unprecedented deregulation, vast deal-making and high-octane growth on Wall Street.

Citigroup fell far short of those lofty goals. Over time, it found itself repeatedly beset by behind-the-scenes problems in the boardroom and executive suites.

It came under repeated fire from shareholders for lackluster results; its stock price has fallen more than 75 percent since it was formed. More recently, Citigroup has been hobbled by more than $65 billion in losses, write-downs for troubled assets and charges for future losses largely linked to a huge mortgage-related stake that the bank’s own internal risk management team and other executives failed to understand.

These problems fed criticism of lax oversight and lapses in internal controls within the bank. It became subject to investigation by numerous regulators into its various business dealings. Wall Street seemed to conclude the company was too big to manage, if not too big to fail.

Vikram S. Pandit took over Citigroup in December 2007 after the tumultuous tenure of Charles O. Prince III, the handpicked successor of Mr. Weill. Under Mr. Prince, Citigroup began a partial deconstruction of the company, selling off its Travelers insurance business and shedding its Legg Mason asset management units.

But after a four-month “dispassionate review” of Citigroup’s businesses, Mr. Pandit pledged to continue with those plans to keep the company intact and promised better management. He planned to shed more than $400 billion of assets over several years, not a matter of months. These long-range plans also included shedding noncore businesses like Primerica insurance, offloading toxic mortgage assets and focusing on a business strategy that would make the bank look increasingly like the old Citicorp bank, with less emphasis on trading.

Even so, Mr. Pandit considered Smith Barney, the bank’s retail brokerage unit, a crown jewel that the bank was unlikely to sell.

But federal regulators pushed Mr. Pandit to move faster. Since at least last fall, regulators had been urging Citigroup to replace several directors and rethink its strategy. Officials were concerned with the investor reaction to the company’s plans and asked the bank to clarify its business model, according to the people familiar with the discussions.

Mr. Pandit, a cerebral but sometimes indecisive manager, huddled with a handful of close confidants to develop new plans during the fall. Most of his own senior business managers were kept out of the loop.

But Citigroup’s troubles kept getting worse. By late December, Mr. Pandit grew concerned about the bank’s depleted capital levels as he prepared to report another devastating quarterly loss to a fractured board.

Under pressure from regulators, Mr. Pandit made the tough decision that the bank’s beloved Smith Barney unit would have to be spun off, touching off the beginning of a final dismantling of the firm.
437 2009-01-14 IS IT REAL? Feel free to bring your checkbook to the Detroit auto show. Maserati representatives told us that the Quattroporte Sport GT S is officially on sale.

WHAT THEY SAID “The Quattroporte Sport GT S is one of Maserati’s answers to the tough times facing the world,” said Harald J. Wester, chief executive of Maserati. “Possibly what was suitable in 2008 will not be relevant in 2009.”

WHAT THEY DIDN’T SAY The existing Maserati Quattroporte Sport has a 425-horsepower 4.7-liter V-8 engine and costs $125,750. The new Quattroporte Sport GT S has eight additional horsepower (433), and costs roughly $8,000 more. That averages to nearly $1,000 for each additional horse.

WHAT MAKES IT TICK? The 4.7-liter V-8 engine found in any Quattroporte has an exhaust note so good it should be bottled up and sold. Maserati claims that the Quattroporte Sport GT S is capable of going from 0 to 60 5.1 seconds and can reach a top speed of 177 mile an hour. In addition to the modest power boost over other models, the Sport GT S has sportier (i.e. lowered) suspension, along with an improved 6-speed automatic transmission.

HOW MUCH, HOW SOON? The Quattroporte Sport GT S is priced at $133,700 and is on sale now. Factor in gas-guzzler tax and destination charges — strangely left out of the sticker price of the car in Detroit — and the price jumps to $138,100.

HOW’S IT LOOK? It’s hard being cynical when a car is as come hither as the Quattroporte. The lines of this sleek sports sedan are aging as gracefully as a leggy Italian supermodel.
438 2009-01-14 Lipitor, the world’s best-selling drug at $13 billion a year, accounts for a fourth of Pfizer’s revenue. A follow-up cholesterol drug, torcetrapib, failed in 2006 when it was linked to cardiovascular disease and death in clinical trials, leaving a gash in Pfizer’s pipeline.

Many analysts predict that Pfizer will try to acquire smaller companies for new drugs.

Edward F. X. Hughes, a professor who teaches pharmaceutical business at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, said that Pfizer’s in-house research had cost billions and produced little for the market in recent years, making layoffs inevitable.

“It’s probably not the last of it,” Mr. Hughes said. “Their research activity has been, I think, particularly unrewarding. It just has not panned out.”

Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said Pfizer’s problems were not unique. “Other companies need to do the same thing,” Mr. Gordon said. “It’s really hard to turn a research dollar into a profit dollar.” He predicted more layoffs in Pfizer’s sales force, too.

“It can’t be over yet,” he said. “It’s too soon and it’s too small. So I think you might see another 400 to 800 people in the next six to nine months also be not needed by the new, refocused Pfizer.”

Wall Street reacted on Tuesday by bidding Pfizer up 1.3 percent, to $17.59 a share, although that is still nearly 28 percent lower than the price a year ago. A Goldman Sachs report on Monday said Pfizer “more than any other pharma company, needs to take action and enact a fundamental change.”

The notice of long-rumored new layoffs was first reported on Tuesday on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Kerins said Pfizer managers began meeting with affected employees on Tuesday morning and would continue to do so into next week.

Asked about future layoffs, Mr. Kerins said, “To be very candid, this is clearly an ongoing process, and we’re always going to look for the more effective and efficient ways to run our company.”

Pfizer appointed a new chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, in July 2006, and a new head of global research and development, Martin Mackay, in September 2007. Mr. Kindler promised to cut up to $2 billion in costs by the end of 2008 and made that goal, Mr. Kerins said.

Mr. Mackay told analysts last week that Pfizer still expected to have 24 to 28 compounds in late-stage clinical trials by the end of this year.
439 2009-01-14 Skidding oil prices helped push the United States trade deficit to its lowest point in five years in November as the country imported fewer goods amid a sharp economic slowdown.

The gap between the value of imports and exports narrowed to $40.4 billion in November, from $56.7 billion a month earlier, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. That represented a 28.7 percent decline in one month.

The trade deficit shrank as American consumers clipped their demand for foreign-made consumer goods, and tumbling energy prices slashed the value of imported oil and gas. Petroleum imports dropped 36.5 percent, to $23.6 billion.

Even excluding energy prices, the so-called core trade deficit narrowed in November.

Although American exports fell by $8.7 billion between October and November, the losses were marginal compared with the 12 percent, or $25 billion, drop in imports. The United States exported a total of $142.8 billion in goods and services in November and imported $183.2 billion.

“It’s still a pretty sizable trade deficit, but it’s going in the right direction,” said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at Barclay’s Capital. “Unfortunately, it comes with a lot of pain.”

The imbalance with China dropped 17.5 percent, to $23.1 billion, in November, the smallest deficit since June. The decline was fairly broad, including toys, clothing and electronics.

The trade deficit through November is at an annual rate of $688.2 billion, down from $700.3 billion a year ago.

Over all, trade between the United States and the rest of the world has plunged since the summer as the financial crisis ravaged global markets, deepening the economic downturn.

“Trade flows have been crushed by the credit crunch, which has reduced demand for traded goods and services and made it more difficult for ex- porters and imports to obtain trade finance,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note.
440 2009-01-14 Broad stock indexes rose slightly as a rebound in oil prices lifted energy producers and improving credit markets helped banks, but blue chips were lower amid concern about falling profits.

Exxon Mobil and Chevron gained at least 1.4 percent as crude rose for the first time in six days. JPMorgan Chase & Company and Citigroup rallied more than 5.3 percent after three-month bank borrowing rates declined to the lowest level since June 2003.

Alcoa tumbled 5.1 percent after reporting a wider-than-estimated loss as the recession decimated demand for aluminum.

About seven stocks rose for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 1.53 points, or 0.18 percent, to 871.79. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 25.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,448.56. The Nasdaq rose 7.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,546.46.

“The stock market is cheap by big-picture standards,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “Anyone buying in today has to be looking past the valley and into 2010 and 2011. Credit conditions underneath the surface are improving pretty consistently.”

479 2009-01-15 Q. My husband and I each own an iPod and we share a computer at home. We’d like to share some music, but we also want to create our own playlists. What’s the best way to set up iTunes to support two iPods on a shared computer?

A. You can take control over what goes on each iPod by changing its settings from the default automatic synchronization to manual music management. Just plug in the iPod to the computer, click on the iPod’s icon when it comes up in the iTunes window and click on the Summary tab. Put a check in the box next to “Manually manage music and videos” and click the Apply button.

Now you can drag and drop (or delete) music and playlists from the connected iPod instead of having everything in the iTunes library get automatically copied over. Each iPod user can cherry-pick the songs he or she wants on each iPod — and leave the unwanted tracks behind.

But you don’t have to drag and drop everything. The iTunes program lets you synchronize specified playlists. Click the Music tab for the connected iPod and check off the playlists (like, say, your ever-changing Workout playlist) you want to keep current on the portable player. Apple has details at support.apple.com/kb/HT1535. The site also has instructions for other ways to manage multiple iPods on one computer at support.apple.com/kb/HT1495.

Q. Is there a way to get the proper accents on non-English words without having to use the Symbol menu in Microsoft Word?
480 2009-01-15 She can display impatience or angry outbursts — from icy silence to ejecting people from her office — at perceived betrayals, schedule delays or ill-prepared answers in staff meetings.

“She does not deal with dissension well,” said State Senator Kenneth D. Cheuvront, a Democrat who has tangled with her but praises her intellect and management.

Mario Diaz, who managed Ms. Napolitano’s successful campaign for attorney general in 1998 and her first run for governor in 2002, said, “She was candidate, campaign manager, communications director, the chief financial officer.

“I say that because she knows everything that is going on in her administration,” Mr. Diaz said, recalling how he once complained that he could not meet all her demands because “I am a human being.” Ms. Napolitano replied, he said, “Be a superhuman being!”

A top aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because personnel discussions are meant to be confidential, said Ms. Napolitano had made it clear to President-elect Barack Obama that she was interested in being attorney general or homeland security secretary. If there was any sense she preferred the attorney general post because of her background as a prosecutor, it has not been evident, the aide said, as she has plunged into the inner workings of the department with the goal of tamping down on infighting and making it more unified.

In a brief interview here as she counted down the minutes before the State of the State address, Ms. Napolitano was circumspect about her plans. But she suggested that she saw the Homeland Security Department as ripe for change, despite the counsel of the current secretary, Michael Chertoff, who has cautioned against too much tinkering.

“It’s still new and still being built,” she said. “It’s still a newbie, so it gives you an opportunity” to make an impact.

Ms. Napolitano, who has already rented out her condo here (there is no governor’s mansion), left for Washington on Tuesday (though she will not resign as governor until confirmed by the Senate) and has made no plans to return to Arizona anytime soon, aides said.

“I’m told that once my furniture has crossed state lines, I am committed,” she joked to staff members.

Ms. Napolitano is not entirely new to Washington. Most memorably, she was a lawyer for Anita Hill in the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas as Supreme Court justice in 1991. Then, some Republicans suggested that she had coached a witness too much, and questions about that led to a brief delay in 1993 in confirming her nomination, by President Bill Clinton, to be United States attorney in Arizona.

But Republicans and Democrats on the Senate’s homeland security committee as well as Arizona’s two senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl, both Republicans, have lauded her smarts and credentials. Most here predict a hassle-free confirmation process.

“She is as driven as she is smart,” said Stan Barnes, a veteran Republican consultant and former state legislator here.

If confirmed, a wealth of ticklish problems awaits her.

There are mounting calls by environmentalists and Latino advocates to halt or slow the construction of a border wall, which Ms. Napolitano has suggested gets overemphasized at the expense of technology and other means to secure the border.

Sweeping workplace enforcement raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have come under fire, along with that agency’s struggles to provide health care for detainees, several of whom have died in custody.

Two former directors of the Federal Emergency Management Agency have urged that it be broken away from the Department of Homeland Security and returned to its status as an independent agency answering directly to the president.

Whatever anxiety she may feel is leavened with her typically dry humor. At a private farewell gathering this week, an aide took note of her love of opera and asked which one best applied to her new job.

Ms. Napolitano demurred, people at the meeting said, noting that heroines tend to die in operas.

Kidding aside, Ms. Napolitano leaves a state that, like many others, is in one of its worst fiscal crises, with some programs she championed, including the expansion of kindergarten to a full day, potentially at risk.

Some Democrats chafe that her departure turns over the governor’s office to a Republican, Secretary of State Jan Brewer, giving the party control of the Legislature and the executive branch.

“She was a backstop for us,” said Kyrsten Sinema, one of several Democratic lawmakers bracing for divisive battles over the swelling deficit, abortion rights, gun control and immigration.

As governor, Ms. Napolitano has won over many ranking Republicans, except the more right-wing members of the party who hold legislative leadership posts and have had many of their bills vetoed.

“She governs more to the middle,” said Matt Salmon, a former congressman and Republican state party chairman who narrowly lost to Ms. Napolitano in her first run for governor. “She has done a good job overall reaching across the aisle.”

Ms. Napolitano, in perhaps her most serious personal challenge, underwent a mastectomy to treat breast cancer in 2000; a spokeswoman said the governor had been cancer-free since then.

Ms. Napolitano, who was born in New York City and lived in Pittsburgh before moving to Albuquerque when she was 6, showed an early interest in politics, watching the Watergate hearings with her father, a retired medical school dean at the University of New Mexico.

She was voted most likely to succeed in high school, where she stood out as a musician who played clarinet and guitar. She studied political science at her father’s alma mater, Santa Clara University near San Jose, Calif., where she was the first woman to be valedictorian. She graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law, then clerked for a federal appeals court judge in Phoenix, where she decided to settle in.

Her big political break came when the law firm in Phoenix she was working for was hired to represent Ms. Hill.

Ms. Napolitano narrowly won the race for governor in 2002 but handily won re-election in 2006. Polls consistently rank her as among the most popular elected officials in the state, which, despite its conservative reputation, has been growing more moderate politically as waves of newcomers arrive from California and elsewhere.

Still, few here doubted that Ms. Napolitano would take a job with Mr. Obama, if offered, and most everyone expects her to take to Washington a work ethic that already has made national headlines.

A fellow Democratic governor, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, noting that she has never been married and has no children, called her a perfect choice for the homeland security post “because for that job, you have to have no life.”

Ms. Napolitano, staff members said, responded with a hearty laugh. She knew, they said, that there was a kernel of truth to it.
481 2009-01-15 About 40 minutes into the hearing, the authority chairman, H. Dale Hemmerdinger, addressed the crowd, which had grown raucous at times.

“I want to assure you we don’t want to do any of what we have proposed,” he said over the shouts. “We don’t want to do any of this. We don’t want to frighten anybody.” Over some boos, he encouraged the audience to write to lawmakers to urge them to provide more money for the authority.

Despite all the shouting, sizable fare increases and service cuts are on the way unless state lawmakers step in to approve a new revenue source for the authority.

Even then, however, some cuts may still be necessary and a fare increase, although a smaller one, would still be likely.

Although the public’s input may influence where cuts are made, the authority is confronted by its worst financial crisis in two decades, and has said that it must raise fare and toll revenues by 23 percent, starting in June. That could mean the cost of a single ride on the subway or bus could go as high as $3, up from $2. The seven-day unlimited ride MetroCard could go to $31, from $25; and the 30-day MetroCard could rise as high as $103, from $81.

On the commuter railroads, many ticket prices could rise by as much as 29 percent.

On the authority’s bridges and tunnels, the one-way fare at major crossings like the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge could rise to $5.26, from $4.15 for E-ZPass. Cash tolls could rise to $6.50, from $5.

The proposed fare and toll increases are intended to help eliminate a $1.2 billion deficit in this year’s budget. They would be coupled with reductions in expenses, including the deepest service cuts in years.

Those would include eliminating more than two dozen New York City Transit bus routes and cutting nighttime and weekend service on many other routes. The W and Z subway lines would also be eliminated, and off-peak service on other subway lines would be cut. Many subway station booths would be shuttered and five N train stations in Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn would be closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The proposed cutbacks are so extensive that for the subways and buses alone, the list of service cuts fills more than 200 pages.

To hold off these extreme measures, the state is considering a rescue plan for the authority that was proposed by a state commission headed by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman.

The commission proposed using a new tax on payrolls and charging tolls on the currently free bridges over the East River and Harlem River to generate revenue.

If state legislators approve a bailout, officials have said that they could forgo most or all of the worst service cuts, but that an 8 percent increase in fare and toll revenues would still be needed. Under one proposal being considered, that could lead to a base subway and bus fare of $2.25 and a 30-day MetroCard fare of $88.

Officials at the authority have said they hope the state will act quickly on a rescue plan. Under its more draconian proposal, the first service cuts could begin before the summer, while many others would not begin before the fall. The fare and toll increases, whether large or small, are scheduled to begin in June. The authority most recently raised fares and tolls last March.

Waiting for her turn to speak, Dorothy Arkell, a retired teacher, held a bright orange sign calling for the authority to save the M8 bus, which runs crosstown in Manhattan between Greenwich Village and the East Village and is slated for elimination.

“It is a disgrace,” Ms. Arkell told a reporter of the plan to cut the route. “Somebody sat someplace with a red pencil and decided to do away with it.”

Ms. Arkell, who lives in Greenwich Village, said she often took the bus three or four times a day, including trips to a senior center and for shopping.

“It’s just a lifeline for getting around,” she said.

Christine Heyward, 65, was at the hearing to protest the plan to cancel another bus route, the M10; she lives about a block from the end of the bus line at the northern end of Frederick Douglass Boulevard. She told a reporter she had bad knees, making it hard for her to walk to other bus routes or use the subway.

“We have no alternative,” she said. “We’ve got children there that go to school, a lot of handicapped and elderly.”
482 2009-01-15 WASHINGTON — Top Obama administration officials met for nearly an hour with Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday, hoping to persuade them to support the release of the second half of the Treasury’s $700 billion financial bailout money.

But several lawmakers said they still wanted better assurances that the money would be used to improve the credit markets and would be more carefully supervised.

President Bush formally asked for release of the $350 billion on Monday at the request of President-elect Barack Obama. Congress can block the money if both chambers vote to do so. If that happens, Mr. Obama has said he would veto the disapproval resolution, allowing the money to flow. Both the president-elect and Congressional Democrats say they hope that will not become necessary.

The Senate could vote on a disapproval motion as early as Thursday. Obama transition officials and senior Congressional aides have expressed confidence that there will be enough votes to defeat the disapproval motion.

The House on Thursday is expected to vote to approve new legislation, drafted by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would impose tough new restrictions on how the $350 billion would be spent, including a requirement that at least $40 billion be used to prevent home foreclosures. The Obama team has indicated that it opposes any new legislation, and the Senate has shown little interest in a new bill.
483 2009-01-15 “Look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes. He said so himself,” Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Geithner’s remarks in a private meeting with the Senate Finance Committee the day before. But Mr. Obama said Mr. Geithner had made a common mistake and corrected it.

The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, early Wednesday postponed Mr. Geithner’s confirmation hearing from Friday to the day after the inauguration. Senators said the delay was unrelated to the tax issue, but at least for a time it will leave Mr. Obama without a Treasury secretary.

The panel’s senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, declined for a second day to take a position on Mr. Geithner’s nomination. In an interview with Iowa reporters, Mr. Grassley reiterated his concern about having a Treasury secretary, with responsibility for the Internal Revenue Service, who had been delinquent on taxes. But he said Mr. Geithner had been “very sincere” in accounting for his violations.

He added: “I don’t believe there’s any doubt about his qualifications. For a partisan person like Obama, appointing a relative political independent as Geithner is, I think that that’s a plus.”

Mr. Geithner called other senators to discuss the controversy, if they wanted, as well as his views on the big issues that otherwise had been expected to dominate his confirmation hearing: an emerging $800 billion economic recovery blueprint, plans for the remaining half of a $700 billion financial bailout fund, and ideas for rewriting regulations for the nation’s financial system to avoid another collapse.

The controversy over his taxes, as it happens, goes to the one area where Mr. Geithner has the least experience, despite serving 13 years at the Treasury Department: domestic tax policy.

Mr. Geithner, 47, rose from a lower-level civil servant at the department at the end of Ronald Reagan’s presidency to under secretary for international affairs under President Bill Clinton, then was a director of the International Monetary Fund before becoming president of the New York Fed in late 2003.

Mr. Obama chose Mr. Geithner on Nov. 24, despite knowing of the tax issue.

“Life’s about choices” is a favorite saying of Mr. Geithner’s, according to associates. Lately he has said it so often that he gets laughs even from the professorial Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, breaking up the unfunny times that the two men — with current Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. — have had in past months making difficult choices about which institutions to bail out and which to let fail.

Mr. Obama’s hard choice was between Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who had been Mr. Geithner’s mentor and boss at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, served as Mr. Clinton’s final Treasury secretary and wanted another turn. In a first meeting with Mr. Obama three weeks before the election, Mr. Geithner, in characteristic self-effacement, told him, “Larry would be great as Treasury secretary,” according to someone familiar with the meeting.

But Mr. Summers had drawbacks in the Obama camp’s eyes. He had clear Clinton connections when the “change” campaign was trying to limit those ties. Mr. Summers also was known to have a sometimes difficult personality, and his troubled tenure as president of Harvard University had left some women’s and minority groups bitter and posed potential confirmation problems.

On Oct. 17, at a New York hotel, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner met for an hour and talked about policy and personal matters, according to accounts of the session. Mr. Obama, who spent four childhood years with his mother in Indonesia, asked Mr. Geithner about his own early years in India and then Thailand as his father oversaw Asia development programs for the Ford Foundation.

What neither man knew at the time, but the foundation has confirmed, is that Mr. Geithner’s father, Peter F. Geithner, oversaw a program that Mr. Obama’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro, had worked on. The two may even have met in Jakarta.

Obama advisers say the candidate “fell in love” with Mr. Geithner, in the words of one, while a Geithner associate said Mr. Geithner reported being “smitten” with Mr. Obama. “They both have that kind of quiet confidence in their demeanor,” the associate said.

When an Obama adviser asked Mr. Geithner if he wanted to be considered for the Treasury job, he said he had to first consult his family — his wife, Carole Sonnenfeld Geithner, a grief counselor for poor New York children whom he had met as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and two teenagers, Elise, 17, and Benjamin, 14. The job would also pay less than half of the $411,200 he made last year at the Fed. The family acquiesced, and Mr. Geithner turned over reams of records — including the years of tax returns.

When Mr. Obama announced the nomination, he also named Mr. Summers as director of the National Economic Council, to coordinate policy from the West Wing. Ever since, the biggest question among associates is how well the two men will get along, what with Mr. Geithner, the onetime underling, now “the chief economic spokesman for my administration,” in Mr. Obama’s words, and Mr. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, enjoying proximity to the Oval Office.

The morning of the announcement, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers had breakfast together in the Chicago Hilton. Since the Treasury years, they have continued to consult each other, friends say, and play tennis at economic gatherings. Mr. Geithner told others that he regretted that the weeks of media speculation had focused so much on Mr. Summers’ reputed arrogance. He joked at his own expense that the news media’s story line amounted to, “Larry is arrogant and smart; Geithner’s not so smart but he’s very humble.”

In truth, Mr. Geithner is known as exceptionally smart and unafraid to speak up — traits that drew Mr. Summers’s attention at the Treasury Department 16 years ago.

“I might worry if I didn’t know it was Tim on the other end of the phone or across the street from Larry,” said a former Treasury Department colleague of both men who did not want to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the confirmation process. “Because I’ve seen them, I’ve seen them clash, I’ve seen them have real, real serious different perspectives on an issue, and I’ve never seen them damage that relationship. And you can’t say that about many people.”
484 2009-01-15 The 240,000 people with tickets to the swearing-in and the thousands of additional people with tickets to watch the parade are only a fraction of the numbers expected to walk or take buses or subways to the Mall. Most of those without tickets, if they see anything at all, will watch on 20 Jumbotrons that the authorities, fearing that even a small incident could provoke a stampede, hope will keep people in one place.

While the federal security officials have not projected their total cost for the inauguration, officials in the District of Columbia have said the city might spend nearly $50 million. State officials in Maryland and Virginia have estimated they might spend $12 million and $16 million respectively, and officials in each of the three jurisdictions have said they hope the federal government will help pay for their expenses.

The security plan covers not just the events on Jan. 20, but also the welcome concert for Mr. Obama on Jan. 18 at the Lincoln Memorial, which is expected to draw as many as half a million people, and nearly 100 official balls, concerts and receptions that will not end until the early morning hours of Jan. 21.

So far, analysis of intelligence has not yielded evidence of an overseas or domestic threat, said Joseph Persichini Jr., who is in charge of the F.B.I.’s Washington office. But, he said, the assessment changes daily.

“This is a global event,” Mr. Persichini said. “The intelligence community and our partners are very cognizant of it. Everybody feels the urgency. We continue to believe the threat is low, but no lead goes untouched.”

He said that the overall security plan was largely an expansion of emergency response plans that have been in effect since the 2001 terrorist attacks.

“We’re taking what we do every day and magnifying it,” Mr. Persichini said. “That’s a challenge.”

It has been known that Mr. Obama’s election had resulted in threats against him and intensified racist commentary on Web sites used by white supremacists. In response, Mr. Persichini said that agents in the F.B.I.’s 56 field offices had been asked to review old files and contact sources to anticipate potential trouble.

Less visibly, federal authorities will deploy 155 intelligence teams of plainclothes agents throughout the region including at Metro subway stations in the outer suburbs of Virginia and Maryland. Based on the knowledge that the London subway bombers in 2005 used outlying feeder stations as staging points, the agents will move through the crowds on foot looking for suspicious behavior.

Teams of intelligence analysts, evidence response technicians, bomb experts, cybersecurity specialists, hostage negotiators, emergency medical personnel and SWAT units will also be nearby and out of sight in off-site locations unless they are needed.

Public and private buildings will be closed to normal business near where Mr. Obama will be sworn in and along the parade route up Pennsylvania Avenue. No one will be permitted to enter a nearly two-square-mile area without a bag search and passing through a metal detector. Officials have warned people not to bring strollers, folding chairs, coolers and umbrellas.

With roads and five major bridges leading into the city closed for the inauguration, and vehicular traffic excluded from large parts of downtown, transit officials have warned riders of “crush conditions” and long waits for buses and subways.

Fighter jets will provide air cover and Coast Guard boats equipped with automatic weapons will patrol the Potomac River. Chemical, biological and radiological detectors, installed after the Sept. 11 hijackings, are already in place.

Businesses and hoteliers have been briefed to be watchful during the inaugural events, in part because the authorities want to increase security awareness after the Mumbai attackers last November singled out soft targets like hotels that were lightly secured.

Salvatore R. Lauro, chief of the United States Park Police, which has jurisdiction over the Mall, said that the authorities had experience screening large numbers of people moving in and out of the open space during events like the Fourth of July celebration, so his worries focus elsewhere.

“We worry about normal criminal activity, we worry about terrorism and we worry about medical issues,” Mr. Lauro said. “But what keeps me up at night is the weather. It could be very uncomfortable for everyone. We’re just hoping for a nice January day.”
485 2009-01-15 But other plans envision an excruciating task requiring new American laws authorizing the government to hold indefinitely without charge or trial those people deemed dangerous.

So far, the signals are that President-elect Barack Obama will reject as un-American the calls for a law allowing indefinite detention. Coupled with that, the new administration may view risk differently than the old one, willing, perhaps, to take the chance of releasing a broken man like Mr. Qahtani, whom the Bush administration has locked up as if he were a ticking time bomb.

If Mr. Qahtani does end up going home, it may not be because the new government concludes that he is no risk at all, but because of a view that maintaining the Guantánamo prison, with its seemingly endless supply of embarrassments, is not worth the cost in terms of the United States’ image abroad or at home.

But a next question is sure to be how much risk to American safety the Obama administration is willing to take. In a series of moves this week, including Ms. Crawford’s interview published Wednesday by The Washington Post, Bush administration officials seemed to be making a public case that closing the Guantánamo center would be perilous. Ms. Crawford, the senior official in the Pentagon’s military commission system for prosecuting detainees, told Bob Woodward of The Post that Mr. Qahtani remained “a very dangerous man.”

“What do you do with him now,” she added, “if you don’t charge him and try him? I would be hesitant to say.”

In the same vein, the Pentagon this week distributed its latest tally of released detainees it classifies as having “returned to the fight” against Americans. A spokesman put the number at 61, but did not provide any way of authenticating that number, and the tally itself has sometimes been viewed as little more than public relations for the Guantánamo center.

But if the incoming officials were not clear on the complexities of closing the prison, Wednesday’s reaction to Ms. Crawford’s remarks focused the mind. Defense lawyers and human rights groups said Mr. Qahtani was far from the only detainee who was treated abusively — or tortured, to use Ms. Crawford’s word.

But Vice President Dick Cheney, for whom Ms. Crawford once worked at the Pentagon, insisted in an interview on PBS on Wednesday that “we don’t torture,” adding that “enhanced interrogation” had been approved by the Justice Department. “A great many Americans are alive today because we did all that,” Mr. Cheney said.

He conceded only that it was “entirely possible that it was a problem in terms of how one specific prisoner was handled.”

Still, legal filings, investigations and reports are full of accounts of detainees kept in isolation cells or restrained in stress positions until they urinated on themselves. Military records show that one teenage detainee, Mohammed Jawad, was moved from cell to cell 112 times in a 14-day period in 2004 to keep him in a state of sleepless disorientation.

The Pentagon said Ms. Crawford was not available for comment Wednesday. But Jameel Jaffer, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who was a co-editor of a book on the treatment of detainees, said her published remarks made it clear that torture might not only be defined as including the most extreme measures, like waterboarding, which has been described by some as half drowning. Ms. Crawford said military interrogators also crossed the line with a combination of lesser tactics.

“We probably know more about al Qahtani’s treatment than we do about many other detainees,” Mr. Jaffer said, “but it is a mistake to present al Qahtani’s treatment as an aberration.”

Officials and lawyers were asking on Wednesday how many other detainees at Guantánamo Bay might not be successfully prosecuted because of their treatment. The five detainees with whom Mr. Qahtani was originally charged in the Sept. 11 attacks were all held for years in secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons. The self-described chief planner of the 2001 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, was one of three prisoners the agency has said it subjected to waterboarding.

But the fallout from Ms. Crawford’s remarks went beyond implications for the Obama administration’s efforts at prosecution. Some on Capitol Hill said the fallout added pressure to the calls for an investigation of detention and interrogation practices, perhaps by a national investigative commission, or for an inquiry into whether American officials may have committed crimes.

“It does create a problem for the Obama administration,” said Scott L. Silliman, director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University. “What do you do when you have an allegation from a senior official of the Bush administration that we committed a war crime?”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Judge Richard J. Leon of Federal District Court ordered the military on Wednesday to release a 21-year-old detainee who has been accused of being a terrorist since he was 14.

The military accused the man, Mohammed el Gharani, of being part of Al Qaeda, working for the Taliban and fighting American forces in Afghanistan. Mr. Gharani is a Chadian who has lived in Saudi Arabia. Judge Leon said the accusations were based on testimony from other Guantánamo Bay detainees, which he found unreliable.

A Justice Department spokesman said it would consider its options.
486 2009-01-15 The popular drugs known as atypical antipsychotics, prescribed for an array of conditions, including schizophrenia, autism and dementia, double patients’ risk of dying from sudden heart failure, a study has found.

The finding is the latest in a succession of recent reports contradicting the long-held assumption that the new drugs, which include Risperdal, Zyprexa and Seroquel, are safer than the older and much less expensive medications that they replaced.

The risk of death from the drugs is not high, on average about 3 percent in a person being treated at least 10 years, according to the study, published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Nor was the risk different from that of the older antipsychotic drugs.

But it was significant enough that an accompanying editorial urged doctors to limit their prescribing of antipsychotic drugs, especially to children and elderly patients, who can be highly susceptible to the drugs’ side effects, including rapid weight gain.

In recent years, the newer drugs, which account for about 90 percent of the market, have become increasingly controversial, as prescription rates to children and elderly people have soared. Doctors use the drugs to settle outbursts related to a host of psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. Most are not approved for such use. After an analysis of study data, the Food and Drug Administration required that all antipsychotics’ labels contain a warning that the drugs were associated with a heightened risk of heart failure in elderly patients.

The new study, an analysis of more than 250,000 Medicaid records, is the first to rigorously document that risk for the newer drugs in adults over 30 without previous heart problems.

In the study, researchers at Vanderbilt University and the Nashville Veterans Affairs Medical Center analyzed Tennessee Medicaid records for 276,907 people ages 30 to 74. About a third of them began taking an antipsychotic medication in the period studied, from 1990 to 2005, either a newer atypical or an older drug. Two-thirds made up a control group. The researchers excluded patients with heart disease or other problems that might put them at higher risk of cardiac failure. Antipsychotic drugs can affect heart rhythm in some vulnerable people.

They found 478 sudden cardiac deaths among those taking the drugs, about twice the rate of the control group. The risk  equivalent to 3 deaths for every 1,000 patients taking the drugs for a year  was about the same whether people took the newer or older medications. The higher the dose of the drug, the study found, the higher the risk of sudden death.

“The implication of this study is that physicians need to do a very careful cardiovascular evaluation prior to prescribing these drugs,” especially if there are alternative treatments, said the lead author, Wayne A. Ray, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt and the Nashville veterans’ hospital. “Then, if they’re used, to pay careful attention to using the lowest possible dose.”

Dr. Ray’s co-authors were Dr. Cecilia P. Chung, Dr. Katherine T. Murray, Kathi Hall, and C. Michael Stein, all of Vanderbilt.

In 2005, government-sponsored researchers reported that three of four new antipsychotic drugs tested were no more effective than an older, far less expensive drug in treating schizophrenia  the disorder for which they were originally approved.

In 2006, doctors working on the same large study reported that the drugs were no more effective than placebos for most elderly patients being treated for dementia-related psychosis. Since then, several review articles have come to similar conclusions, and raised concern about a far more common side effect: weight gain.

“When it comes to treating kids, these cardiac events are going to be rare,” said Dr. Jon McClellan, a psychiatrist at the University of Washington. “But heart problems due to obesity are not rare, and the public-health implications of kids on these drugs gaining 10 to 15 pounds are much greater.”
487 2009-01-15 BEIJING — Environmental officials have cleared plans to build a chemical plant outside Zhangzhou, 60 miles southwest of a previously planned site where residents had protested that it would create unsafe levels of pollution.

The plant had previously been proposed for Xiamen, a port city with a population of 1.5 million, in the southeast province of Fujian.

The decision to relocate it is a rare victory for those fighting government-supported development. News of the relocation was reported on the Web site of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and printed Wednesday in the state-run China Daily.

The plant will produce paraxylene, a petrochemical used in the manufacture of polyester and cleaning agents.

In 2007, thousands of people staged rallies against the Tenglong Aromatic PX plant, a Taiwanese-financed venture that would have been built about 10 miles from the center of Xiamen. The protests, organized via text messages and through blog postings, received considerable coverage in the state-controlled news media.

More than 100 members of a prominent government body, the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, also called for the plant’s relocation.
488 2009-01-15 Also arriving is a spate of promotions related to Inauguration Day, some in Washington and some elsewhere around the country. For instance, visitors to Washington will see billboards congratulating Mr. Obama from Sheik Khalid bin Saqr al-Qasimi, the exiled deputy ruler and crown prince of Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.

And Quaker Oatmeal will host house parties on Tuesday morning in 11 cities — Washington included — where women who write so-called mommy blogs will serve breakfast to friends and other guests before they watch coverage of the ceremonies.

The intent is “to capture the excitement and optimism of the moment,” said Shelley Haus, director for the Quaker breakfast portfolio at the Quaker Oat Company in Chicago, part of PepsiCo, “and to spark on this feeling of inspiration.”

To ameliorate any feeling that Quaker is trying to commercialize a noncommercial event, the company will use the house parties to raise awareness for a fund-raising campaign that began this week (startwithsubstance.com). The campaign benefits the organization Share Our Strength to help feed hungry children.

Besides, Ms. Haus said, “everyone loves Quaker Oats, whether Republicans or Democrats.”

Another PepsiCo division, Pepsi-Cola North America Beverages, is incorporating the inauguration into a campaign for its flagship brand, Pepsi-Cola, which started on New Year’s Eve and carries the theme “Refresh everything.” Visitors to a Web site (refresheverything.com) are invited to leave messages or video clips for Mr. Obama, a k a “the man who is about to refresh America.”

In Washington, Pepsi-Cola will sponsor the inaugural ball of the Creative Coalition, an arts and entertainment advocacy organization, as well as a symposium at Howard University, titled “Refresh the World,” that is to feature participants like Spike Lee, Queen Latifah and the Rev. Al Sharpton.

“Without commenting specifically on the president-elect, it is a cultural moment for everybody,” said Ralph Santana, vice president for colas at Pepsi-Cola North America Beverages in Purchase, N.Y., “and I do think it transcends politics.”

The event will be marked with Pepsi-Cola commercials on coverage of the inauguration on networks like CNN and MSNBC, Mr. Santana said, where the brand is rarely advertised. There will also be ads in newspapers, he said, and on billboards and posters at sites in Washington like Union Station.

Pepsi-Cola will be sharing the station with Ikea, which will promote its two stores in the Washington area by recreating the Oval Office, inside Union Station, with samples of its budget home furnishings. Ikea is also sponsoring a special Web site (embracechange09

.com) and sending a presidential-style limousine around town with Ikea furniture and boxes strapped to the roof in a cross between “Hail to the Chief” and “The Beverly Hillbillies.”

“I grew up in Washington, and this is like the Super Bowl for D.C.,” said Peter Nicholson, partner and chief creative officer at Deutsch in New York, the Interpublic Group agency that creates campaigns for Ikea North America.

The promotion is presented “in the language of politics that Washingtonians understand,” Mr. Nicholson said, centering on “starting over, embracing change at home, being fiscally responsible.”

The maker of Hennessy Cognac, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is using numerology rather than language in its promotion, selling 180,000 bottles, priced at $30 each, bearing seals and labels on the front and back emblazoned with “44” and phrases like “In honor of the 44th president” and “In honor of the presidential inauguration.”

The company plans to make donations to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund for each bottle sold, said Andy Glaser, senior vice president for Hennessy at Moët Hennessy USA in New York, with a goal of starting two four-year scholarships through a minimum donation of $50,000.

Celebrities will be asked to autograph bottles, he added, which will be sold at auction later this year to benefit the fund.

For the media companies clambering aboard the Obama-wagon, the focus is on commemorative issues and more.

For example, this week’s issue of Newsweek carries an ad inviting readers to preorder the “special inaugural issue,” which is described as a “limited edition!” The price: $9.95 plus shipping and handling, or more than twice the regular cover price.

Also, computer users registered at washingtonpost.com received e-mail messages on Wednesday promoting “Inauguration Central,” including information on coming news coverage, “inauguration collectibles” and photographs for sale of the election and inauguration of Mr. Obama.

The trade publication Editor and Publisher reported that The Washington Post plans to print 2.7 million copies of its editions dated Tuesday and Wednesday; the Nov. 5 edition, reporting on Mr. Obama’s election, set a record by selling almost 1.6 million copies. The Post, washingtonpost.com and Newsweek are units of the Washington Post Company.

This week’s issue of The New Yorker magazine carries an ad inviting readers to “own a piece of history” by ordering a free copy of the commemorative cover of the Jan. 26 inauguration issue. Copies will be mailed to those who place orders on a Web site (newyorker.com/user/registration).

A spokeswoman for The New Yorker, Alexa Cassanos, said that the number of orders in the first 24 hours exceeded the number the magazine expected in total.

The Nov. 17 issue of The New Yorker, with a cover commenting on Mr. Obama’s election, sold out, she added, by selling 87,000 copies on newsstands. Typically, the magazine sells 40,000 to 60,000 copies a week on newsstands.

Other covers featuring Mr. Obama along with cartoons about him, which are being sold by the online store of The New Yorker, “have sold phenomenally well,” Ms. Cassanos said. The magazine is part of the Condé Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications.
489 2009-01-15 Embracing the Western companies may be the only way to shore up Petróleos de Venezuela and the raft of social welfare programs, like health care and higher education for the poor, that have been made possible by oil proceeds and have helped bolster his popular support.

“If re-engaging with foreign oil companies is necessary to his political survival, then Chávez will do it,” said Roger Tissot, an authority on Venezuela’s oil industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting company focusing on Latin America. “He is a military man who understands losing a battle to win the war.”

While the new oil projects would not be completed for years, Mr. Chávez is already looking beyond the end of his current term in 2012 by putting forward a referendum, expected as early as next month, that would let him run for indefinite re-election.

In recent years, Mr. Chávez has preferred partnerships with national oil companies from countries like Iran, China and Belarus. But these ventures failed to reverse Venezuela’s declining oil output. State-controlled oil companies from other nations have also been invited to bid this time, but the large private companies are seen as having an advantage, given their expertise in building complex projects in Venezuela and elsewhere in years past.

The bidding process was first conceived last year when oil prices were higher but Petróleos de Venezuela’s production decline was getting impossible to overlook. Still, the process is moving into high gear only this month, with the authorities here expected to start reviewing the companies’ bidding plans on new areas of the Orinoco Belt, an area in southern Venezuela with an estimated 235 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Altogether, more than $20 billion in investment could be required to assemble devilishly complex projects capable of producing a combined 1.2 million barrels of oil a day.

Mr. Chávez’s olive branch to Western oil companies comes after he nationalized their oil fields in 2007. Two companies, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, left Venezuela and are still waging legal battles over lost projects.

But Venezuela may have little choice but to form new ventures with foreign oil companies. Nationalizations in other sectors, like agriculture and steel manufacturing, are fueling capital flight, leaving Venezuela reliant on oil for about 93 percent of its export revenue in 2008, up from 69 percent in 1998 when Mr. Chávez was first elected.

In the past year, with higher oil prices paving the way, Mr. Chávez also vastly expanded Petróleos de Venezuela’s power, inextricably linking it to his political program. He directed the oil company to build roads, import and distribute food, build docks and shipyards and set up a light-bulb factory. He even expanded it into areas like milk production, soybean farming and the training of athletes after a weak performance at the Beijing Olympics.

One of the oil company’s ventures sells subsidized food and extols Mr. Chávez’s leadership at its stores across Venezuela. At one frenzied store in eastern Caracas, posters hung from the ceiling last Saturday showing Mr. Chávez arm in arm with children beneath the heading, “fortifying agrarian socialism.”

Petróleos de Venezuela has also carried out nationalizations in other industries, absorbing companies like Electricidad de Caracas, the utility serving this city of five million. Top executives like Eulogio del Pino, the Stanford-educated vice president for exploration and production, spent much of 2008 negotiating unfinished deals like the takeover of a cement company.

But all the while, Petróleos de Venezuela has faced its own difficulties. It claimed it produced about 3.3 million barrels a day throughout most of 2008. But other sources, like OPEC, of which Venezuela is a member, place the figure closer to 2.3 million and show a fall of about 100,000 barrels a day from a year earlier. When Mr. Chávez rose to power a decade ago, Venezuela was producing about 3.4 million barrels a day.

Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister and president of Petróleos de Venezuela, did not respond to requests for an interview. But energy executives here with contacts within Petróleos de Venezuela said Mr. Ramírez, a confidant of Mr. Chávez, has been waging a struggle within the company to refocus operations toward producing more oil.

After weathering the turmoil of recent years, Western oil companies here are loath to speak publicly about their plans. “We don’t elaborate on bidding processes beyond the fact that we evaluate every opportunity and our decisions will be based on economics and other factors,” said Scott Walker, a spokesman for Chevron.

But energy executives here speak with restrained optimism. Nineteen companies paid $2 million each last month for data on areas open for exploration, twice what such data costs elsewhere.

Oil companies say they recognize the risk of investing in Venezuela, given the country’s abrupt shifts in the past. But they focus on the long-term potential of its petroleum reserves. Venezuela poses little risk in the search for oil since geologists have known for years where it lies in the Orinoco Belt.

Venezuela also differs from top oil nations like Saudi Arabia and Mexico, where national oil companies have monopolies. Petróleos de Venezuela let private companies remain as minority partners after the nationalizations, despite Mr. Chávez’s often aggressive anticapitalist stance.

Moreover, foreign oil services companies like Halliburton, which has done business in Venezuela for 70 years, have even expanded their activities in the country as Petróleos de Venezuela grew more dependent on contractors to help extract oil from aging wells.

Still, doubts persist over the chances that the new bids, which are set to conclude in June, will ultimately result in finished oil projects. Risks of operating here were underscored again last week when Venezuela ordered new production cuts along with other OPEC members, impacting ventures with private partners.

Under the current bidding rules, the onus for financing the new projects lies with the foreign companies, even though Petróleos de Venezuela would maintain control. Banks might balk at such a prospect. Distrust also lingers in dealing with Petróleos de Venezuela.

“An agreement on a piece of paper means nothing in Venezuela because of the way Chávez abruptly changes the rules of the game,” said a Venezuelan oil executive who has had dealings with oil companies from China, Russia and other countries.

“In 10 years, not one major oil project has been built in Venezuela,” said the oilman, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. “Chávez has left his so-called strategic partners out to dry, like the Chinese, who have been given the same treatment as Exxon.”

But the severity of the drop in oil prices may ultimately dictate the terms on which Venezuela re-engages with foreign oil companies.

“Chávez is celebrating the demise of capitalism as this international crisis unfolds,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, a former board member of Petróleos de Venezuela. “But the irony is that capitalism actually fed his system in times of plenty,” he said. “That is something Chávez will discover the hard way.”
490 2009-01-15 Q. My husband and I each own an iPod and we share a computer at home. We’d like to share some music, but we also want to create our own playlists. What’s the best way to set up iTunes to support two iPods on a shared computer?

A. You can take control over what goes on each iPod by changing its settings from the default automatic synchronization to manual music management. Just plug in the iPod to the computer, click on the iPod’s icon when it comes up in the iTunes window and click on the Summary tab. Put a check in the box next to “Manually manage music and videos” and click the Apply button.

Now you can drag and drop (or delete) music and playlists from the connected iPod instead of having everything in the iTunes library get automatically copied over. Each iPod user can cherry-pick the songs he or she wants on each iPod — and leave the unwanted tracks behind.

But you don’t have to drag and drop everything. The iTunes program lets you synchronize specified playlists. Click the Music tab for the connected iPod and check off the playlists (like, say, your ever-changing Workout playlist) you want to keep current on the portable player. Apple has details at support.apple.com/kb/HT1535. The site also has instructions for other ways to manage multiple iPods on one computer at support.apple.com/kb/HT1495.
491 2009-01-15 Beginning Jan. 17, 1stdibs.com will offer what its founder, Michael Bruno, imagines as a garage sale for the digital age: a weekly roundup of antiques and vintage furniture sold at discounts that are steeper than usual. The prices will almost certainly be higher than those at real garage sales, but most will be 25 to 60 percent below retail.

Every Saturday at 8 a.m. Eastern time, “there will be a fresh batch” of markdowns, Mr. Bruno said. A link to the sale will appear on the site’s home page, and all registered shoppers will be notified by e-mail.

This week’s sale will include more than 500 items, like a pair of 1940s French rope armchairs ($1,800); an 18th-century Austrian wing chair ($1,222); and a 19th-century English oak breakfront bookcase ($12,500). Information: 1stdibs.com.
492 2009-01-15 But by the middle of 1931, Norman was the only remaining member of the original foursome. Strong had died in 1928 at the age of fifty-five, Moreau had retired in 1930, and Schacht had resigned in a dispute with his own government in 1930 and was flirting with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. And so the mantle of leadership of the financial world had fallen on the shoulders of this colorful but enigmatic Englishman with his "waggish" smile, his theatrical air of mystery, his Van Dyke beard, and his conspiratorial costume: broad-brimmed hat, fl owing cape, and sparkling emerald tie pin.

For the world's most important central banker to have a nervous breakdown as the global economy sank yet deeper into the second year of an unprecedented depression was truly unfortunate. Production in almost every country had collapsed — in the two worst hit, the United States and Germany, it had fallen 40 percent. Factories throughout the industrial world — from the car plants of Detroit to the steel mills of the Ruhr, from the silk mills of Lyons to the shipyards of Tyneside — were shuttered or working at a fraction of capacity. Faced with shrinking demand, businesses had cut prices by 25 percent in the two years since the slump had begun.

Armies of the unemployed now haunted the towns and cities of the industrial nations. In the United States, the world's largest economy, some 8 million men and women, close to 15 percent of the labor force, were out of work. Another 2.5 million men in Britain and 5 million in Germany, the second and third largest economies in the world, had joined the unemployment lines. Of the four great economic powers, only France seemed to have been somewhat protected from the ravages of the storm sweeping the world, but even it was now beginning to slide downward.

Gangs of unemployed youths and men with nothing to do loitered aimlessly at street corners, in parks, in bars and cafés. As more and more people were thrown out of work and unable to afford a decent place to live, grim jerry-built shantytowns constructed of packing cases, scrap iron, grease drums, tarpaulins, and even of motor car bodies had sprung up in cities such as New York and Chicago — there was even an encampment in Central Park. Similar makeshift colonies littered the fringes of Berlin, Hamburg, and Dresden. In the United States, millions of vagrants, escaping the blight of inner-city poverty, had taken to the road in search of some kind — any kind — of work.

Unemployment led to violence and revolt. In the United States, food riots broke out in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and across the central and southwestern states. In Britain, the miners went out on strike, followed by the cotton mill workers and the weavers. Berlin was almost in a state of civil war. During the elections of September 1930, the Nazis, playing on the fears and frustrations of the unemployed and blaming everyone else — the Allies, the Communists, and the Jews — for the misery of Germany, gained close to 6.5 million votes, increasing their seats in the Reichstag from 12 to 107 and making them the second largest parliamentary party after the Social Democrats. Meanwhile in the streets, Nazi and Communist gangs clashed daily. There were coups in Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Spain.

The biggest economic threat now came from the collapsing banking system. In December 1930, the Bank of United States, which despite its name was a private bank with no official status, went down in the largest single bank failure in U.S. history, leaving frozen some $200 million in depositors' funds. In May 1931, the biggest bank in Austria, the Creditanstalt, owned by the Rothschilds no less, with $250 million in assets, closed its doors. On June 20, President Herbert Hoover announced a one-year moratorium on all payments of debts and reparations stemming from the war. In July, the Darmstadt and National Bank, the third largest in Germany, foundered, precipitating a run on the whole German banking system and a tidal wave of capital out of the country. The chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, declared a bank holiday, restricted how much German citizens could withdraw from their bank accounts, and suspended payments on Germany's short-term foreign debt. Later that month the crisis spread to the City of London, which, having lent heavily to Germany, found these claims now frozen. Suddenly, faced with the previously unthinkable prospect that Britain itself might be unable to meet its obligations, investors around the world started withdrawing funds from London. The Bank of England was forced to borrow $650 million from banks in France and the United States, including the Banque de France and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to prevent its gold reserves from being completely depleted.

As the unemployment lines lengthened, banks shut their doors, farm prices collapsed, and factories closed, there was talk of apocalypse. On June 22, the noted economist John Maynard Keynes told a Chicago audience, "We are today in the middle of the greatest catastrophe — the greatest catastrophe due almost to entirely economic causes — of the modern world. I am told that the view is held in Moscow that this is the last, the culminating crisis of capitalism, and that our existing order of society will not survive it." The historian Arnold Toynbee, who knew a thing or two about the rise and fall of civilizations, wrote in his annual review of the year's events for the Royal Institute of International Affairs, "In 1931, men and women all over the world were seriously contemplating and frankly discussing the possibility that the Western system of Society might break down and cease to work."

During the summer a letter that Montagu Norman had written just a few months before to his counterpart at the Banque de France, Clément Moret, appeared in the press. "Unless drastic measures are taken to save it, the capitalist system throughout the civilized world will be wrecked within a year," declared Norman, adding in the waspish tone that he reserved for the French, "I should like this prediction to be filed for future reference." It was rumored that before he went off to convalesce in Canada, he had insisted that ration books be printed in case the country reverted to barter in the wake of a general currency collapse across Europe.

At times of crisis, central bankers generally believe that it is prudent to obey the admonition that mothers over the centuries have passed on to their children: "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all." It avoids the recurring dilemma that confronts financial officials dealing with a panic — they can be honest in their public statements and thereby feed the frenzy or they can try to be reassuring, which usually entails resorting to outright untruths. That a man in Norman's position was willing to talk quite openly about the collapse of Western civilization signaled loud and clear that, in the face of the "economic blizzard," monetary leaders were running out of ideas and ready to declare defeat.

Not only was Norman the most eminent banker in the world, he was also admired as a man of character and judgment by financiers and officials of every shade of political opinion. Within that bastion of the plutocracy the partnership of the House of Morgan, for example, no one's advice or counsel was more highly valued — the firm's senior partner, Thomas Lamont, would later acclaim him as "the wisest man he had ever met." At the other end of the political spectrum, the British chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Snowden, a fervent Socialist who had himself frequently predicted the collapse of capitalism, could write gushingly that Norman "might have stepped out of the frame of the portrait of the most handsome courtier who ever graced the court of a queen," that "his sympathy with the suffering of nations is as tender as that of a woman for her child," and that he had "in abundant measure the quality of inspiring confidence."

Norman had acquired his reputation for economic and financial perspicacity because he had been so right on so many things. Ever since the end of the war, he had been a fervent opponent of exacting reparations from Germany. Throughout the 1920s, he had raised the alarm that the world was running short of gold reserves. From an early stage, he had warned about the dangers of the stock market bubble in the United States.

But a few lonely voices insisted that it was he and the policies he espoused, especially his rigid, almost theological, belief in the benefits of the gold standard, that were to blame for the economic catastrophe that was overtaking the West. One of them was that of John Maynard Keynes. Another was that of Winston Churchill. A few days before Norman left for Canada on his enforced holiday, Churchill, who had lost most of his savings in the Wall Street crash two years earlier, wrote from Biarritz to his friend and former secretary Eddie Marsh, "Everyone I meet seems vaguely alarmed that something terrible is going to happen financially. . . . I hope we shall hang Montagu Norman if it does. I will certainly turn King's evidence against him."

The collapse of the world economy from 1929 to 1933 — now justly called the Great Depression — was the seminal economic event of the twentieth century. No country escaped its clutches; for more than ten years the malaise that it brought in its wake hung over the world, poisoning every aspect of social and material life and crippling the future of a whole generation. From it fl owed the turmoil of Europe in the "low dishonest decade" of the 1930s, the rise of Hitler and Nazism, and the eventual slide of much of the globe into a Second World War even more terrible than the First. The story of the descent from the roaring boom of the twenties into the Great Depression can be told in many different ways. In this book, I have chosen to tell it by looking over the shoulders of the men in charge of the four principal central banks of the world: the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve System, the Reichsbank, and the Banque de France. When the First World War ended in 1918, among its innumerable casualties was the world's financial system. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an elaborate machinery of international credit, centered in London, had been built upon the foundations of the gold standard and brought with it a remarkable expansion of trade and prosperity across the globe. In 1919, that machinery lay in ruins. Britain, France, and Germany were close to bankruptcy, their economies saddled with debt, their populations impoverished by rising prices, their currencies collapsing. Only the United States had emerged from the war economically stronger. Governments then believed matters of finance were best left to bankers; and so the task of restoring the world's finances fell into the hands of the central banks of the four major surviving powers: Britain, France, Germany, and the United States.

This book traces the efforts of these central bankers to reconstruct the system of international finance after the First World War. It describes how, for a brief period in the mid-1920s, they appeared to succeed: the world's currencies were stabilized, capital began fl owing freely across the globe, and economic growth resumed once again. But beneath the veneer of boomtown prosperity, cracks began to appear and the gold standard, which all had believed would provide an umbrella of stability, proved to be a straitjacket. The final chapters of the book describe the frantic and eventually futile attempts of central bankers as they struggled to prevent the whole world economy from plunging into the downward spiral of the Great Depression.

The 1920s were an era, like today's, when central bankers were invested with unusual power and extraordinary prestige. Four men in particular dominate this story: at the Bank of England was the neurotic and enigmatic Montagu Norman; at the Banque de France, Émile Moreau, xenophobic and suspicious; at the Reichsbank, the rigid and arrogant but also brilliant and cunning Hjalmar Schacht; and finally, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Benjamin Strong, whose veneer of energy and drive masked a deeply wounded and overburdened man.

These four characters were, for much of the decade, at the center of events. Their lives and careers provide a distinctive window into this period of economic history, which helps to focus the complex history of the 1920s — the whole sorry and poisonous story of the failed peace, of war debts and reparations, of hyperinflation, of hard times in Europe and bonanza in America, of the boom and then the ensuing bust — to a more human, and manageable, scale.

Each in his own way illuminates the national psyche of his time. Montagu Norman, with his quixotic reliance on his faulty intuition, embodied a Britain stuck in the past and not yet reconciled to its newly diminished standing in the world. Émile Moreau, in his insularity and rancor, reflected all too accurately a France that had turned inward to lick the terrible wounds of war. Benjamin Strong, the man of action, represented a new generation in America, actively engaged in bringing its financial muscle to bear in world affairs. Only Hjalmar Schacht, in his angry arrogance, seemed out of tune with the weak and defeated Germany for which he spoke, although perhaps he was simply expressing a hidden truth about the nation's deeper mood.

There is also something very poignant in the contrast between the power these four men once exerted and their almost complete disappearance from the pages of history. Once styled by newspapers as the "World's Most Exclusive Club," these four once familiar names, lost under the rubble of time, now mean nothing to most people.

The 1920s were a time of transition. The curtain had come down on one age and a new age had yet to begin. Central banks were still privately owned, their key objectives to preserve the value of the currency and douse banking panics. They were only just beginning to espouse the notion that it was their responsibility to stabilize the economy.

During the nineteenth century, the governors of the Bank of England and the Banque de France were shadowy figures, well known in financial circles but otherwise out of the public eye. By contrast, in the 1920s, very much like today, central bankers became a major focus of public attention. Rumors of their decisions and secret meetings filled the daily press as they confronted many of the same economic issues and problems that their successors do today: dramatic movements in stock markets, volatile currencies, and great tides of capital spilling from one financial center to another.

They had to operate, however, in old-fashioned ways with only primitive tools and sources of information at their disposal. Economic statistics had only just begun to be collected. The bankers communicated by mail — at a time when a letter from New York to London took a week to arrive — or, in situations of real urgency, by cable. It was only in the very last stages of the drama that they could even contact one another on the telephone, and then only with some difficulty.

The tempo of life was also different. No one fl ew from one city to another. It was the golden age of the ocean liner when a transatlantic crossing took fi ve days, and one traveled with one's manservant, evening dress being de rigueur at dinner. It was an era when Benjamin Strong, head of the New York Federal Reserve, could disappear to Europe for four months without raising too many eyebrows — he would cross the Atlantic in May, spend the summer crisscrossing among the capitals of Europe consulting with his colleagues, take the occasional break at some of the more elegant spas and watering holes, and finally return to New York in September.

The world in which they operated was both cosmopolitan and curiously parochial. It was a society in which racial and national stereotypes were taken for granted as matters of fact rather than prejudice, a world in which Jack Morgan, son of the mighty Pierpont Morgan, might refuse to participate in a loan to Germany on the grounds that Germans were "second rate people" or oppose the appointment of Jews and Catholics to the Harvard Board of Overseers because "the Jew is always a Jew first and an American second, and the Roman Catholic, I fear, too often, a Papist first and an American second." In finance, during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, whether in London or New York, Berlin or Paris, there was one great divide. On one side stood the big Anglo-Saxon banking firms: J. P. Morgan, Brown Brothers, Barings; on the other the Jewish concerns: the four branches of the Rothschilds, Lazards, the great German Jewish banking houses of Warburgs and Kuhn Loeb, and mavericks such as Sir Ernest Cassel. Though the WASPs were, like so many people in those days, casually anti-Semitic, the two groups treated each other with a wary respect. They were all, however, snobs who looked down on interlopers. It was a society that could be smug and complacent, indifferent to the problems of unemployment or poverty. Only in Germany — and that is part of this story — did those undercurrents of prejudice eventually become truly malevolent.

As I began writing of these four central bankers and the role each played in setting the world on the path toward the Great Depression, another figure kept appearing, almost intruding into the scene: John Maynard Keynes, the greatest economist of his generation, though only thirty-six when he first appears in 1919. During every act of the drama so painfully being played out, he refused to keep quiet, insisting on at least one monologue even if it was from offstage. Unlike the others, he was not a decision maker. In those years, he was simply an independent observer, a commentator. But at every twist and turn of the plot, there he was holding forth from the wings, with his irreverent and playful wit, his luminous and constantly questioning intellect, and above all his remarkable ability to be right.

Keynes proved to be a useful counterpoint to the other four in the story that follows. They were all great lords of finance, standard-bearers of an orthodoxy that seemed to imprison them. By contrast, Keynes was a gadfly, a Cambridge don, a self-made millionaire, a publisher, journalist, and best-selling author who was breaking free from the paralyzing consensus that would lead to such disaster. Though only a decade younger than the four grandees, he might have been born into an entirely different generation.

To understand the role of central bankers during the Great Depression, it is first necessary to understand what a central bank is and a little about how it operates. Central banks are mysterious institutions, the full details of their inner workings so arcane that very few outsiders, even economists, fully understand them. Boiled down to its essentials, a central bank is a bank that has been granted a monopoly over the issuance of currency.* This power gives it the ability to regulate the price of credit — interest rates — and hence to determine how much money flows through the economy.

Despite their role as national institutions determining credit policy for their entire countries, in 1914 most central banks were still privately owned. They therefore occupied a strange hybrid zone, accountable primarily to their directors, who were mainly bankers, paying dividends to their shareholders, but given extraordinary powers for entirely nonprofi t purposes. Unlike today, however, when central banks are required by law to promote price stability and full employment, in 1914 the single most important, indeed overriding, objective of these institutions was to preserve the value of the currency.

At the time, all major currencies were on the gold standard, which tied a currency in value to a very specific quantity of gold. The pound sterling, for example, was defined as equivalent to 113 grains of pure gold, a grain being a unit of weight notionally equal to that of a typical grain taken from the middle of an ear of wheat. Similarly, the dollar was defined as 23.22 grains of gold of similar fineness. Since all currencies were fixed against gold, a corollary was that they were all fixed against one another. Thus there were 113/23.22 or $4.86 dollars to the pound. All paper money was legally obligated to be freely convertible into its gold equivalent, and each of the major central banks stood ready to exchange gold bullion for any amount of their own currencies

Gold had been used as a form of currency for millennia. As of 1913, a little over $3 billion, about a quarter of the currency actually circulating around the world, consisted of gold coins, another 15 percent of silver, and the remaining 60 percent of paper money. Gold coinage, however, was only a part, and not the most important part, of the picture.

Most of the monetary gold in the world, almost two-thirds, did not circulate but lay buried deep underground, stacked up in the form of ingots in the vaults of banks. In each country, though every bank held some bullion, the bulk of the nation's gold was concentrated in the vaults of the central bank. This hidden treasure provided the reserves for the banking system, determined the supply of money and credit within the economy, and served as the anchor for the gold standard.

While central banks had been granted the right to issue currency — in effect to print money — in order to ensure that that privilege was not abused, each one of them was required by law to maintain a certain quantity of bullion as backing for its paper money. These regulations varied from country to country. For example, at the Bank of England, the first $75 million equivalent of pounds that it printed were exempt, but any currency in excess of this amount had to be fully matched by gold. The Federal Reserve (the Fed), on the other hand, was required to have 40 percent of all the currency it issued on hand in gold — with no exemption floor. But varied as these regulations were, their ultimate effect was to tie the amount of each currency automatically and almost mechanically to its central banks' gold reserves.

In order to control the flow of currency into the economy, the central bank varied interest rates. It was like turning the dials up or down a notch on a giant monetary thermostat. When gold accumulated in its vaults, it would reduce the cost of credit, encouraging consumers and businesses to borrow and thus pump more money into the system. By contrast, when gold was scarce, interest rates were raised, consumers and businesses cut back, and the amount of currency in circulation contracted.

Because the value of a currency was tied, by law, to a specific quantity of gold and because the amount of currency that could be issued was tied to the quantity of gold reserves, governments had to live within their means, and when strapped for cash, could not manipulate the value of the currency. Inflation therefore remained low. Joining the gold standard became a "badge of honor," a signal that each subscribing government had pledged itself to a stable currency and orthodox financial policies. By 1914, fifty-nine countries had bound their currencies to gold.

Few people realized how fragile a system this was, built as it was on so narrow a base. The totality of gold ever mined in the whole world since the dawn of time was barely enough to fill a modest two-story town house. Moreover, new supplies were neither stable nor predictable, coming as they did in fits and starts and only by sheer coincidence arriving in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the world economy. As a result, during periods when new gold finds were lean, such as between the California and Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and the discoveries in South Africa in the 1890s, prices of commodities fell across the world.

The gold standard was not without its critics. Many were simply cranks. Others, however, believed that allowing the growth of credit to be restricted by the amount of gold, especially during periods of falling prices, hurt producers and debtors — especially farmers, who were both.

The most famous spokesman for looser money and easier credit was Williams Jennings Bryan, the populist congressman from the farm state of Nebraska. He campaigned tirelessly to break the privileged status of gold and to expand the base upon which credit was created by including silver as a reserve metal. At the Democratic convention of 1896 he made one of the great speeches of American history — a wonderfully overripe fl ight of rhetoric delivered in that deep commanding voice of his — in which, addressing Eastern bankers, he declared, "You came to tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile plains. Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the city. . . . You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."

It was a message whose time had come and gone. Ten years before he delivered that speech, two gold prospectors in South Africa, while out for a Sunday walk on a farm in the Witwatersrand, stumbled across a rocky formation that they recognized as gold-bearing reef. It proved to be an outcrop of the largest goldfield in the world. By the time of Bryan's speech, gold production had jumped 50 percent, South Africa had overtaken the United States as the world's largest producer, and the gold drought was over. Prices for all goods, including agricultural commodities, once again began to rise. Bryan won the Democratic nomination then and twice more, in 1900 and 1908, but he was never elected president.

Though prices rose and fell in great cycles under the gold standard due to ebbs and flows in the supply of the precious metal, the slope of these curves was gentle and at the end of the day prices returned to where they began. While it may have succeeded in controlling inflation, the gold standard was incapable of preventing the sort of financial booms and busts that were, and continue to be, such a feature of the economic landscape. These bubbles and crises seem to be deep-rooted in human nature and inherent to the capitalist system. By one count there have been sixty different crises since the early seventeenth century — the first documented bank panic can, however, be dated to A.D. 33 when the Emperor Tiberius had to inject one million gold pieces of public money into the Roman financial system to keep it from collapsing.

Each of these episodes differed in detail. Some originated in the stock market, some in the credit market, some in the foreign exchange market, occasionally even in the world of commodities. Sometimes they affected a single country, sometimes a group of countries, very occasionally the whole world. All, however, shared a common pattern: an eerily similar cycle from greed to fear.

Financial crises would generally begin innocently enough with a surge of healthy optimism among investors. Over time, reinforced by cavalier attitudes to risk among bankers, this optimism would transform itself into overconfidence, occasionally even into a mania. The accompanying boom would go on for much longer than anyone expected. Then would come a sudden shock — a bankruptcy, a surprisingly large loss, a financial scandal involving fraud. Whatever the event, it would provoke a sudden and dramatic shift in sentiment. Panic would ensue. As investors were forced to liquidate into a falling market, losses would mount, banks would cut back their loans, and frightened depositors would start pulling their money out of banks.

If all that happened during these periods of so-called distress was that foolish investors and lenders lost money, no one else would have cared. But a problem in one bank raised fears of problems at other banks. And because financial institutions were so interconnected, borrowing large amounts of money from one another even in the nineteenth century, difficulties in one area would transmit themselves through the entire system. It was precisely because crises had a way of spreading, threatening to undermine the integrity of the whole system, that central banks became involved. In addition to keeping their hands on the levers of the gold standard, they therefore acquired a second role — that of forestalling bank panics and other financial crises.

The central banks had powerful tools to deal with these outbursts — specifically their authority to print currency and their ability to marshal their large concentrated holdings of gold. But for all of this armory of instruments, ultimately the goal of a central bank in a financial crisis was both very elusive — to reestablish trust in banks.

Such breakdowns are not some historical curiosity. As I write this in October 2008, the world is in the middle of one such panic — the most severe for seventy-five years, since the bank runs of 1931–1933 that feature so prominently in the last few chapters of this book. The credit markets are frozen, financial institutions are hoarding cash, banks are going under or being taken over by the week, stock markets are crumbling. Nothing brings home the fragility of the banking system or the potency of a financial crisis more vividly than writing about these issues from the eye of the storm. Watching the world's central bankers and finance officials grapping with the current situation — trying one thing after another to restore confidence, throwing everything they can at the problem, coping daily with unexpected and startling shifts in market sentiment shift — reinforces the lesson that there is no magic bullet or simple formula for dealing with financial panics. In trying to calm anxious investors and soothe skittish markets, central bankers are called upon to wrestle with some of the most elemental and unpredictable forces of mass psychology. It is the skill that they display in navigating these storms through uncharted waters that ultimately makes or breaks their reputation.

*The monopoly need not be complete. In Britain, while the Bank of England was granted a monopoly of currency in 1844, Scottish banks continued to issue currency and existing English banks with the authority to issue currency were grandfathered. The last private English banknotes were issued in 1921 by Fox, Fowler and Company, a Somerset bank.

493 2009-01-15 In a sign of deepening fragility among the nation’s largest banks, the government is preparing to throw a new multibillion-dollar lifeline to Bank of America, several people briefed on the talks said Wednesday, the latest effort to stem a tide of growing losses in the financial system.

Bank of America, which was already granted $25 billion in capital from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program in October, is seeking billions more to shore up its balance sheet as it struggles with mounting losses at Merrill Lynch, which it recently acquired, said these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Bank of America’s shares fell 4.2 percent, to $10.20, in regular trading Wednesday, and are down nearly 30 percent this year. At one point in after-hours trading, the shares fell to their lowest level since 1991.

The government’s willingness to feed Bank of America a new tranche of taxpayer money comes on the heels of greater federal intervention in Citigroup. After pumping more than $45 billion in Treasury money onto its balance sheet, the government has put pressure on Citigroup to dismantle its troubled empire in an effort to stop losses and curb capital injections.

Regulators are struggling to restore confidence in the nation’s financial system as banks gird for a tsunami of losses from the eroding economy, which threatens to further devalue a range of assets like mortgage-linked securities, commercial real estate and credit card debt still held in large amounts on the books of many.

“It feels like a black hole,” said John McDonald, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “Investors are having a difficult time sizing the scope and magnitude of the credit losses in the banks’ balance sheets, and their earnings are under attack from a worsening economy.”

Private investors are no longer willing to pour in new money to the banks, he added. “The government is the only option if there isn’t time to earn the capital back,” he said.

The preparations for further support come after Bank of America’s chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, told regulators in mid-December that the shotgun deal it signed just two months earlier with Merrill Lynch was in jeopardy.

Billions of dollars in write-downs on mortgages, commercial real estate and other credit assets at the brokerage firm climbed into double-digit territory in the fourth quarter, pushing Merrill into a substantial loss, said a person who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to disclose the information. Fearing their own capital base could not support Merrill’s flagging assets, executives at Bank of America told regulators they would need assistance in order to close the deal by their target date of Jan. 1.

Treasury officials expressed concern that a failure to seal a deal with Merrill  whose fate had been jeopardized during the height of the financial crisis  would further destabilize the precarious financial system. The officials agreed to work out a plan to put the deal back on track, according to the people briefed on the negotiations. The government has come under fire for its decision to allow Lehman Brothers to fail in September.

Details of the transaction are still being negotiated, but Bank of America is expected to obtain approval for its multibillion-dollar capital request. The funds would come from the TARP system with more conditions  including tighter restrictions on executive pay  than had been attached to the first round of funds.

“We know that losses are going to increase in Bank of America’s consumer book, including credit cards, home equity loans, first mortgages,” said Jefferson Harralson, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods. “They’ll have to add to their reserves to reflect the consumer environment, which has gotten worse.”

Another element of the deal could involve a loss-sharing agreement, typically reserved for deeply troubled institutions, under which the government would guarantee billions of dollars of risky assets, said the people briefed on the talks. That provision would be similar to the one Citigroup struck with regulators in late November, when its stock collapsed.

It was not that long ago that Bank of America was viewed as a pillar in the banking sector. But in recent months, its stock has plummeted as investors worried it has acquired companies with their own set of financial baggage.

Besides the Merrill acquisition, Mr. Lewis also acquired the troubled mortgage lender Countrywide last year, in a deal that expanded Bank of America’s reach in the mortgage business but saddled it with serious risks as defaults and delinquencies among American homeowners grew.

Meanwhile, losses are mounting in Bank of America’s consumer credit card and home equity businesses as the economy continues to sputter. Last week it raised $2.8 billion by selling part of its stake in China Construction Bank, and it could sell more. Some analysts say Bank of America may be forced to take other steps to shore up its balance sheet, like cutting its dividend or selling other assets.

Details of the capital infusion are expected to be made known next week when the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., reports fourth-quarter earnings. In recent weeks, analysts have cut their earnings forecasts for the bank, expecting various losses, provisions and charges in the quarter to total $3 billion to $6 billion.

The Countrywide and Merrill Lynch acquisitions have turned Bank of America increasingly into the type of financial supermarket model that Citigroup is now being forced to dismantle. Some analysts warn the next two years could be challenging for Bank of America and its leaders.

“Citi is being unwound because it’s too big and the government wants it smaller,” said Paul Miller, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey. “I think Bank of America, either a year or two out, is going to be dismantled also because its returns are going to be too weak. No management has the expertise or brain power to provide the right required return for investors with institutions that are this size.”

The new lifeline transaction illustrates Mr. Lewis’s negotiating savvy as well as how conditions have worsened since September, when the financial crisis brought Wall Street’s financial titans to their knees. On a weekend in September, when federal officials sought to get Bank of America to help support Lehman Brothers as it crumbled, Mr. Lewis refused a deal unless it came with government assistance. Failing to find a buyer, the government allowed Lehman to collapse.

That same weekend, however, Mr. Lewis struck a deal with John Thain, the chief of Merrill Lynch, to buy its “thundering herd” of 17,000 brokers  a transaction that, at the time, appeared not to require government help.
494 2009-01-15 The tender farewell to Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen) as he retires from the Las Vegas Crime Scene Investigation unit was stretched over two episodes and ends Thursday night on CBS in a tableau of bitten lower lips and suppressed tears.

It’s not just Grissom’s colleagues who are feeling bereft. “CSI” has fiercely loyal male fans, and many of them are misting up over their own lost youth and eight years devoted to watching Grissom examine maggots, blood spray patterns and decayed flesh. Grissom has found a successor, Dr. Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne), a pathologist and college professor who seems to share Grissom’s slavish work ethic and kindly reticence. But Langston is not his only successor. Simon Baker, who plays Patrick Jane on “The Mentalist,” the new CBS hit, is a greater threat to the Grissom legacy. More than any other show, “The Mentalist” signals that intuition is the big new thing, while forensic science and nerdy, obsessive lab workers are old hat.

Grissom, the lead investigator on the show, makes a forlorn plea for his life’s work in his last episode. “People lie,” Grissom tells Langston. “The only thing we can count on is the evidence.”

Nowadays it’s the evidence that fibs. It takes a facile, fake mind reader like Jane, who once made his living pretending to be a psychic, to arrive at the truth. “Lie to Me” a new Fox procedural drama that begins later this month, stars the British actor Tim Roth (American actors are also passé) as Cal Lightman, a sleuth who finds his clues in body language. Lightman is a valued consultant to the F.B.I. because he can read twitches, eye movements and shrugs; he is described on the show as the “foremost deception expert in the country.” Polygraphs can be wrong, but psychics and behavioralists are infallible.

Detectives follow footprints, and detective shows follow trends. It’s sometimes hard to remember that when “CSI” began in 2000, it fetishized forensics and deeply influenced a rash of rival crime shows. It even changed the way the public viewed police work. (Mostly it heightened unrealistic expectations.)

“CSI: Miami” took the formula to South Florida in 2002, and “CSI: NY” brought it north in 2004. Those shows countered NBC’s “Law & Order” franchise, which stressed human drama over leaf decay and DNA swabs. “Law & Order” shows serve up emotional justice; “CSI” series offer scientific reason.

Oddly enough it’s CSI that is the mushiest. “Law & Order” abhors sentimentality. When Detective Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) retired in 2004, he packed his boxes, cast a last look around the squad room and left.

Fans attach themselves to the investigators on “CSI” partly because the criminals are rarely as complex as the main characters. “Law & Order” and its offshoots survive bad seasons and frequent cast changes because the focus of each episode never strays too far from the chalk outline  and it usually leads to a juicy whodunit filled with sleazy investment bankers, corrupt judges, abusive stepfathers and narcissistic socialites. Victims, their survivors and even their killers are rarely as compelling on “CSI” shows. The depiction of death is almost always striking and cinematic, but the lab work  scored to pop music and conducted under the kind of mood indigo lighting usually reserved for jazz clubs  receives more attention.

Light, rather than plot or theme music (all three open with songs by the Who ) is the key to distinguishing one “CSI” series from another. Miami is bathed in dazzling, bright light that makes viewers shade their eyes. But Las Vegas, which is just as famous for its sunshine, is shot in lugubrious shades of gray and sepia that make mornings on the Strip look like a winter afternoon in Reykjavik. (“CSI: NY” started out so dark that viewers needed night-vision goggles; in the second season the producers relented and drew back the drapes.)

Over the years “CSI” fans grew attached to detectives who talk to one another as much as they do to witnesses and spend their time in laboratories rather than on stake-outs or in interrogation rooms. It’s an insular, dimly cozy place, and viewers lean in for the slightest hint of office romance or rivalry, which are meted out in small doses. Grissom has mystique because even after eight years on the job he still has some mystery.

Grissom’s departure (Mr. Petersen is staying on as an executive producer) is responsible for some of the elegiac strains in Thursday’s episode, but not all. There is also nostalgia for a beloved genre that is changing. A recent “CSI” episode, centered on the murder of a shrewish sitcom star, included a rare self-referential joke. A network executive, escorted through the CSI headquarters, spots Wendy Simms (Liz Vassey) hard at work in the lab. “Beautiful people doing high-tech police work,” he says to Grissom. “There might be a series in this.” But now even CBS is favoring series where beautiful people do high-tech guesswork.
495 2009-01-15 Pre-iPod, drivers who wanted to listen to music had little alternative to turning on their radio or manually inserting compact discs (or cassette tapes) into a player. After Apple’s music player arrived, drivers who wanted to ditch those options for the iPod largely had to be content with an external iPod setup, complete with cords, brackets and other unwieldy arrangements.

Fusion Electronics has created an AM-FM car stereo, the CA-IP500, that also is an internal dock for your iPod. Once you’ve secured your iPod in the dock, the CA-IP500 lets you select songs, change the volume and generally control your device via an easy-to-read fully integrated iPod interface, because of an organic light-emitting diode display. Your iPod is being charged at the same time.

The CA-IP500 does need an adapter sleeve to dock your iPod, but the sleeve comes in the package. It’s compatible with iPod Touch, classic and Nanos (a full list is on the company’s Web site, fusioncaraudio.com), and is available now for $250. The head unit also comes with a detachable face plate to fool would-be thieves. AZADEH ENSHA
496 2009-01-15 Two people who are familiar with Mr. Jobs’s current medical treatment said he was not suffering from a recurrence of , but a condition that was preventing his body from absorbing food. Doctors have also advised him to cut down on stress, which may be making the problem worse, these people said.

An Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, said the company had no comment beyond Mr. Jobs’s letter.

Apple shares dropped sharply in after-hours trading after the release of the letter, losing $6.03, or 7.1 percent, to $79.30. The stock fell 2.71 percent in regular trading amid a broad market slump.

Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company who follows Apple, said the stock market would probably fear the worst.

“It is reasonable to expect, given the history of Steve’s illness, that the market is probably going to assume that he is not going to return to Apple,” Mr. Wolf said.

In June, when Mr. Jobs appeared strikingly thin at a company conference for programmers, an Apple spokeswoman said he was recovering from a “common bug.” Soon afterward, Mr. Jobs acknowledged to The that he was suffering from digestive difficulties related to an operation he had as part of his cancer treatment.

Then last week, Mr. Jobs sought to calm speculation about his withdrawal from his regular keynote speech at the annual Macworld conference by acknowledging he had a “hormone imbalance.”

“The letter last week pretty much tried to reassure people that his health condition was extremely minor, but obviously it is more serious than first thought,” Ryan Jacob, founder of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owns a stake in Apple and is based in , said. “It’s disturbing.”

As news trickles from Apple about Mr. Jobs’s health, some shareholders and analysts have expressed frustration.

A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, John J. Nester, declined to comment on Apple’s situation. But he said that in general, while there were no specific requirements for companies to disclose the health of their officers or directors, companies needed to assess whether health problems could have a material impact on results.

For most companies, such information is not crucial because they are not as closely associated with one person. But Apple may be an exception. Since he helped found Apple in 1976, and particularly since he returned in 1997 after a decade-long absence, Mr. Jobs has been inextricably linked to the company and its brand.

Over the last eight years, he has, seemingly single-handedly, powered Apple back to the forefront of the technology industry. Apple has sold 180 million players, and in the last 18 months, it has sold more than 20 million units of its .

But Mr. Jobs does not run Apple alone, and now at least one of his deputies will have a moment in the sun. Mr. Cook joined Apple in 1998 from the computer maker Compaq and is responsible for the company’s manufacturing and sales operations.

“I don’t think we know enough about Tim since he has never really been in the limelight,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “What we can say is Apple has a complicated business model with enormous seasonality. But it has been exceptionally well run across a number of dimensions for a number of years. I think a lot of that credit goes to Tim.”

By all accounts, Mr. Cook does not have the long-term vision or showmanship of Mr. Jobs, who appears capable of peering around corners into the future of technology, and can whip crowds into a frenzy merely by taking something new out of his pocket.

That is why analysts and shareholders saw so much portent in Mr. Jobs’s 170-word letter.

“These are times where you reflect about what Steve Jobs means for the company,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “At the end of the day, investors need to come to grips with the reality of a post-Steve Jobs world. This is the most urgent wake-up call they have had.”
497 2009-01-15 Felix Zuniga, who holds a master’s degree in business from California State in San Bernardino, started Armada Business Services last September to help independent truck owner-operators cope with many demands of regulation, financing, insurance and management. The Inland Empire is a major center for freight transportation. Trucks carry cargo containers 60 miles from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail terminals in San Bernardino County, where they are transferred to railroad cars for transport to other parts of the United States.

But these are difficult times for truck owners. International trade volumes are down in the recession even as truck owners need to meet new environmental regulations by modifying engines. At the same time, banks and other lenders are pulling back on financing for small-business owners. “Truckers have a high failure rate, an average 14 months from going into business to failing,” Mr. Zuniga said. But perhaps adversity can mean opportunity, he said. “It’s when times are tough that the owners especially need our help.”

More than start-ups find opportunities in the current climate. Gem Power L.L.C. is an eight-year-old company that developed software under research contracts for the United States Navy to recharge and extend the life of batteries. “We can double or treble the life of any battery, whether for computers or heavy machinery,” said John James, Gem Power’s president.

The company is now trying for commercial work for its battery-charging systems, marketing to police and fire departments. The commercial effort follows recommendations of a feasibility study by faculty and students at the California State Entrepreneurship Center, which also operates a computer laboratory under a Defense Department program.

Like similar efforts to help small business at the nearby University of California, Riverside, the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship ranges beyond academia to get involved in the business community. The center finances its $2 million annual budget independently, said Michael Stull, an associate professor of business and the director of the center, “by selling consulting and technical assistance services to public agencies.” And the center organizes an annual Spirit of Entrepreneurship award ceremony to encourage and publicize local innovators.

One award recipient is OncoNutrition, which has developed a food supplement that helps cancer patients maintain their appetites and nutritional intake while undergoing chemotherapy. The company, based in the city of Riverside, collaborates with the departments of biology and medicine at the university there. It also benefits from the county’s relatively low-cost commercial space for its laboratories, said Olof Mollstedt, the co-founder and president.

In the current recession, the Inland Empire’s inexpensive real estate is proving in some cases to be an inadvertent asset. Charlie Mello, president of American Custom Coach, for example, has moved his company into a 23,000-square-foot factory in Redlands from a smaller one in nearby Ontario. The larger plant, said Mr. Mello, will allow his company to expand its output of vans that can be fitted out as mobile units for X-rays, mammograms, dental work and blood testing and donations as well as command posts for law enforcement.

“Don’t tell me about a recession,” said Mr. Mello, an engineer who moved to California from Brazil in 1988. American Custom Coach is busy filling orders for medical vans from Qatar, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Middle East and from Angola in southwest Africa. “I’m on my way to Angola,” Mr. Mello said late last month. “It is ordering 14 vans.” He said he intended to expand his company’s work force from 24 employees to as many as 40 in the next two years.

Giroux Glass, a Los Angeles glass contracting company, recently bought a 40,000-square-foot building in San Bernardino for $3 million. “I couldn’t construct a building for $3 million,” said Anne-Merelie Murrel, president of Giroux. Having seized the opportunity, Ms. Murrel said she planned to move fabrication work into the building, “which can help serve our expanding business in Las Vegas.”

Residential real estate is also inexpensive compared with most of Southern California. “Five-bedroom homes are available for $250,000 in the area,” said Ms. Murrel, and Giroux’s employees are eager to buy there.

Such employees will be a key to the area’s recovery, said Lee Searing, president of Searing Industries, a large maker of welded steel pipe in Rancho Cucamonga. “This area was up so high for so long, it had to plateau,” he said. “But a skilled work force wanting to live in the Inland Empire will attract new companies and we’ll recover.”
498 2009-01-15 Nortel’s demise would also be among the biggest business failures in Canadian history. During the zenith of the technology boom, Nortel’s market value accounted for about a third of all equity traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Nortel’s shares peaked at 124.50 Canadian dollars in July 2000 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, Nortel closed at a market price of 12 Canadian cents, or 1.2 cents after adjusting for a stock consolidation. While the current economic slump contributed to Nortel’s decision to file for protection in both Delaware and its hometown, Toronto, the company’s problems began in 2001, when it was hit by the technology stock price collapse and became mired in an accounting scandal that led to criminal charges against three of its former executives.

Nortel’s woes went beyond finances. In the market for Internet-related equipment, Cisco Systems and others proved to be more innovative and successful.

The bankruptcy filing was unanimously approved by Nortel’s board at a meeting in Toronto on Tuesday night. It appears to be an attempt to avoid $107 million in interest payments that are due on Thursday. While the company has about $2.4 billion in cash, that is rapidly depleting.

“Nortel must be put on a sound financial footing once and for all,” the president and chief executive, Mike S. Zafirovski, said in a statement. “These actions are imperative so that Nortel can build on its core strengths and become the highly focused and financially sound leader in the communications industry.”

Without offering details, Mr. Zafirovski, a former senior executive at Motorola, promised yet another revamp of Nortel. Since the beginning of the decade, Nortel has started a series of overhauls that have included 16 rounds of layoffs.

But Paul Holman, the managing director of the debt rating agency DBRS, said that the uncertainty created by the bankruptcy filing creates a new problem for Nortel.

“Customers will be concerned about how long they are going to be around,” he said. Mr. Sue added that Nortel’s competitors will try to exploit that unease by offering Nortel customers enticing deals to switch systems.

It is also unclear if Nortel will be able to sell any of its operating units to raise cash for a corporate revival.

In September, Nortel announced plans to sell a business unit that makes Internet-related and fiber optic equipment. While many analysts viewed it as a strong asset, Nortel has not found a buyer.

Nortel announced a third-quarter loss of $3.4 billion in November, much of that related to write-downs in the value of several operations.

Nortel’s $4.5 billion in debt is largely from the result of an acquisition spree by the company during the 1990s.

The government of Canada offered Nortel some support. Export Development Canada, a government-owned bank and insurer, has agreed to provide the company with up to $30 million in loans for the next 30 days.
499 2009-01-15 A gloomy retail sales report pushed Wall Street sharply lower on Wednesday as investors received another reminder that business was bad.

At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 248.42 points, or 2.9 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down 3.3 percent or 29.17 points. The technology heavy Nasdaq was down 3.6 percent or 56.82 points.

Shares in Europe also were hit hard. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 4.9 percent. All of the major exchanges in Europe fell more than 4 percent.

The government reported on Wednesday that retail sales fell for a sixth consecutive month in December, as Americans holstered their credit cards and cut back on spending, even as stores offered discounts of 80 percent to entice shoppers.

Sales at department stores, restaurants, gas stations and a host of other retail businesses fell 2.7 percent last month  nearly double what economists had been expecting  and were 9.8 percent lower than sales last December, the Commerce Department reported.

Losses on Wall Street were broad, led by financial, energy and retail stocks. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, were down about 1.2 percent, and Citigroup fell 22 percent, to $4.60 a share as the beleaguered banking giant prepared to shear off its prized brokerage unit.

Investors’ optimism buoyed markets after Christmas and in the first days of 2009, but they have run for cover over the last week, erasing those holiday gains.

“There’s an enormous amount of money on the sidelines, not knowing where to go,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s. “If I had a mattress company I’d make a fortune.”

The new retail numbers offered an epitaph for what economists and retailers called the worst holiday shopping season in decades: Electronics sales were down 1 percent in December from a month earlier; food and drinks fell by 1.4 percent and sales at clothing stores were 2.5 percent lower, the Commerce Department said.

“People hunkered down pretty dramatically,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia. “Yes, everybody celebrated the holidays, but there was far less spending than in prior years.”

The fact that retailers did poorly this holiday shopping season was not unexpected, but the size of the decline caught some investors by surprise.

A sharp drop in the business inventories, the most in seven years, was also a reflection of the drop in consumer spending, as companies tried to reduce their costs. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that business inventories were reduced by 0.7 percent in November, worse than the 0.5 percent drop analysts expected. It was the third consecutive month that businesses reduced stockpiles.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, has slowed sharply since mid-September as the problems on Wall Street began to spread. With the uncertainty of jobs weighing on consumers, economists do not expect a turnaround anytime soon.

The recession, which began in December 2007, is expected to last into the second half of 2009, and some economists predict that the current unemployment rate of 7.2 percent could hit 9 percent.

The Fed’s beige book, a regular survey of businesses around the country that was released Wednesday, indicated that the economic slump worsened in December.

“Overall economic activity continued to weaken across almost all of the Federal Reserve districts since the previous reporting period.” the report added.

To help spur the economy and restore confidence, President-elect Barack Obama has promised to push a stimulus package of about $800 billion, which he is pressing Congress to pass in the weeks ahead.

“Consumers are in deep hibernation,” C. Britt Beemer, chief executive of the America’s Research Group, said, “and there is no sign that they will wake up this spring or that the retail outlook will pick up any time soon.”

Anecdotal reports in the Fed’s report confirmed the weak December. Sales were down, the report, said in almost every category  jewelry, appliances and electronics were particularly weak.

According to the Commerce Department, retail sales for 2008 fell 0.1 percent from 2007, with most of the losses coming from a 7.7 percent drop during the last three months of the year.

Much of December’s drop in retail sales came from falling gasoline prices, which have tumbled to a nationwide average of $1.79 a gallon from their peaks of $4.11 in July. Sales at gas stations fell 15.9 percent from November to December, and were down more than 35 percent from December 2007.

But even excluding gasoline and automobiles, retail sales dropped by 1.5 percent for the month, said James O’Sullivan, senior economist at UBS.

“It was a pretty broad-based decline,” he said.

The government’s figures were the latest confirmation of a bleak holiday shopping season.

Last week, an industry group reported that retail sales had fallen 2.2 percent in November and December from a year earlier, and that some of the most widely known brands in America had suffered even worse declines.

Department stores including Nordstrom, Sak’s and Nieman Marcus reported double-digit percentage drops since last year. Abercrombie and Fitch was down by 24 percent and J. C. Penney by 8.1 percent, and even Wal-Mart missed analysts’ expectations and cut its outlook for the months ahead.

And the months ahead will be difficult. January is typically a slow month for retailers, and the significance of a December sales decline is far greater than a drop-off in January because sales in November and December account for 25 to 40 percent of many retailers’ annual sales, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry group.
500 2009-01-15 “We consider ourselves the only remaining global investment bank that has no money from sovereign wealth funds or from taxpayers,” said the bank’s chief executive, Josef Ackermann. “We will do whatever we can to not get into this ball game.”

Less than a week ago, the German government took a quarter stake, and two board seats, in Commerzbank, a major German commercial and consumer bank.

Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Post both insisted there was no pressure from Berlin to complete the deal, which was initially struck in early September, before the turmoil in financial markets.

The renegotiated Postbank deal allows Deutsche Bank to reduce the cash it has to produce up front from 2.2 billion euros to about half that.

Deutsche Post’s 8 percent share will be swapped for an initial portion of 22.9 percent of Postbank’s shares. A bond issued by Deutsche Post that is exchangeable for shares will be settled in three years, giving Deutsche Bank an additional 27.4 percent.

After that, Deutsche Bank will have the opportunity to buy 12.1 percent of Postbank via a series of options.

Deutsche Post agreed that it would sell half its Deutsche Bank shares no earlier than April, and the other half no earlier than June.

Deutsche Bank’s investors have clamored that the bank needs to raise its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its ability to absorb losses. It now stands at 10 percent, considerably lower than that of peers like UBS and Credit Suisse, which received state money.

In a sign of the continuing pressure on banks, shares of HSBC Holdings sank in London on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley analysts predicted it might have to raise as much as $30 billion and cut its dividend in half to plug a capital shortfall.

At Deutsche Bank, profits early last year were weighed down by accelerating losses in the fourth quarter, but Mr. Ackermann said the bank expected to pull through the crisis without having to raise new cash.

The bank estimated it lost 4.8 billion euros in the fourth quarter as chaotic financial markets dragged down its proprietary trading operation, once a huge profit center for Deutsche Bank. It also had to set aside money for trades that it helped insure but that subsequently went bad. And it had to inject cash into its money market funds to make good on promises to their investors.

Mr. Ackermann said Deutsche had largely cleared its books of the toxic assets linked to the United States mortgage market.

Deutsche said it would pay a dividend for 2008 of 50 euro cents a share. Mr. Ackerman conceded that the decision to do so was not without debate, because retaining the money would add “a few hundred million” to Deutsche Bank’s capital, but said the move was popular among its investors.

Deutsche Bank shares tumbled 1.88 euros, or 7.8 percent, on Wednesday to close at 22.09 euros, as banking stocks fell generally across Europe.

512 2009-01-16 Pedro Aguilar, whose innovative style of mambo dancing made him a legend at the Palladium ballroom in Manhattan and a one-man encyclopedia of Latin dance, died Tuesday in Miami. He was 81 and lived in Hallandale, Fla.

The cause was heart failure, said Barbara Craddock, his dance partner for the past 11 years.

Mr. Aguilar, known as Cuban Pete, translated his footwork as a boxer and his childhood tap-dance training into a rhythmically complex, visually arresting dancing style that electrified audiences at the Palladium, the premier showcase for Latin music in the 1940s and 1950s. By his own count he invented 100 signature foot, torso and hand movements with names like the Porpoise, the Shimmy Shimmy and the Prayer.

“He had an impeccable sense of timing that allowed him to dance inside the music,” said Ms. Craddock, who first saw Mr. Aguilar dance in the 1950s. “He painted a picture of the music with his feet.”

Mr. Aguilar was born in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States with his mother at 3. While staying with an uncle in Washington, he was taught tap dancing by a maid who reasoned that if she could hear him tapping out steps on a box, he was not getting into mischief. His mother later taught him the danzón and the bolero.

His parents’ turbulent marriage made his childhood difficult. After he rejoined them in Manhattan, he and his siblings were placed in an orphanage and later put into foster care, from which he emerged, as he put it, “an angry young man” who worked out his rage in the boxing ring.

Encouraged by the former Cuban boxer and singer Miguelito Valdez, he entered a dance contest at the Palladium in 1950 and won the top prize, $1,000. After the bandleaders Tito Puente and Machito helped him master the mambo’s tricky clave rhythm, he went on to win dozens of contests and lasting fame as the mambo craze swept the country. His partner was Millie Donay, who would later become his first wife.
513 2009-01-16 Peter E. Fleming Jr., a prominent criminal-defense lawyer whose client list over more than three decades included high-ranking politicians, flamboyant celebrities and a cast of characters from outbreaks of corporate crime, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.

The cause was complications of lung surgery, his son Peter said.

Among Mr. Fleming’s clients were John N. Mitchell, the former United States attorney general; Don King, the boisterous boxing promoter; John J. Rigas, the founder of what was once the nation’s sixth-largest cable company; and companies operated by Marc Rich, the commodities trader, who received a controversial pardon from President Bill Clinton.

High-profile names also brought Mr. Fleming out of the courts into public service. In 1991, the United States Senate named him as a special counsel to investigate the disclosure of sexual-harassment allegations made by Anita F. Hill against Clarence Thomas during proceedings leading up to Judge Thomas’s confirmation as a Supreme Court justice. The investigation raised anew the volatile question of whether reporters have a constitutional right to conceal confidential sources. The Senate eventually chose not to seek contempt citations against the reporters who had refused to cooperate.

Mr. Fleming also received national attention in 1974 when he successfully defended Mr. Mitchell, President Nixon’s attorney general. Mr. Mitchell, along with Nixon’s commerce secretary, Maurice H. Stans, was accused of obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with an investigation of Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier. Both Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Stans were acquitted. (Mr. Mitchell went to prison in a different case for his role in the Watergate scandals, serving 19 months for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and lying under oath.)

“We pitched a no-hitter,” Mr. Fleming told The New York Times in a 2002 interview in which he recalled the thrill of being barraged by reporters as he descended the steps of the federal courthouse in Manhattan 28 years earlier after the acquittal. He did not mind the limelight.
514 2009-01-16 The contenders for this year’s Orange British Academy Film Awards, the British equivalent of the Oscars, were announced, with “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Frost/Nixon,” “Milk,” “The Reader” and “Slumdog Millionaire” nominated for best picture. The best actor nominees are Frank Langella (“Frost/Nixon”); Dev Patel (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who is only 19 and had never acted in a movie before; Sean Penn (“Milk”); Brad Pitt (“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”); and Mickey Rourke (“The Wrestler”). The best actress nominees are Angelina Jolie (“Changeling”), Kristin Scott Thomas (“I’ve Loved You So Long”), Meryl Streep (“Doubt”) and Kate Winslet, who is nominated twice (for “The Reader” and “Revolutionary Road”). The awards, known as the Baftas, will be handed out Feb. 8 at the Royal Opera House in London.
515 2009-01-16 Senator Ken Salazar pledged Thursday to “clean up the mess” at the Interior Department if he is confirmed as the next chief of the department, which has been plagued by ethics scandals.

Mr. Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, also said he shared President-elect Barack Obama’s commitment to ending the country’s dependence on foreign oil, a goal that he said could be achieved, in part, through greater use of renewable resources like solar and wind power.

But he avoided specifics when members of the Senate Committee on Energy and National Resources, who are considering his confirmation, pressed him on whether he supported an expansion of oil extraction from public lands and offshore drilling.

On the question of whether to open more areas off the coasts to oil exploration, Mr. Salazar said there might be some areas where it would be appropriate and “other places that are off limits.”

The full Senate voted Thursday to set aside two million acres in nine states as protected wilderness. Approval is expected in the House.

Mr. Salazar, who was a farmer and rancher before he entered public life, also promised that on his watch the agency, which has jurisdiction over vast expanses of federal lands, would not be focused solely on the western half of the United States.
516 2009-01-16 The Huskies, often starting three seniors, have an ideal lineup for competing for a national championship. Their starters will be an average of 22 years old when the Final Four rolls around. Seven of their top eight players are upperclassmen. The only one who is not, the freshman guard Kemba Walker, was a top-15 player in the high school class of 2008 and a McDonald’s all-American while playing at Rice High School in Harlem.

Walker did not disappoint his hometown crowd Thursday, scoring 21 points with an array of quick moves and acrobatic layups against St. John’s (10-6, 1-3). He even banked in a 3-pointer as Connecticut pulled away in the second half after leading by 31-30 at the break.

“He may be as good at change of pace at the top as far as dribbling as anyone,” Calhoun said of Walker.

Everything had been going according to the preseason plan for the Huskies until Connecticut opened Big East play by losing at home to Georgetown. Suddenly, the bandwagon got a little lighter.

But Connecticut has quietly gotten back on track, and St. John’s was in a position to notice, having played the nation’s current No. 1 team, Pittsburgh, just four days earlier.

Paris Horne, who scored 24 for the Red Storm, said the Panthers and the Huskies were on the same level. “To me, it was pretty similar,” he said.

St. John’s has only one victory in six games since Dec. 21 — an upset against then-No. 7 Notre Dame. The Huskies have taken care of business in a way, surprisingly, that they have not in 23 years under Calhoun.

They have played three straight games on the road and won them all, marking the first time Calhoun’s Huskies have done so.

“I think it says how difficult this league is, and there’s no such thing as an easy game, especially on the road,” the Connecticut senior A. J. Price said. “It also says this team is pretty good. We’ve done something that even national championship teams haven’t been able to do in previous years.”

This was the eighth time under Calhoun that Connecticut had played three consecutive games on the road, and the third time such a three-game stretch was all in the Big East.

The Huskies have won four straight over all, defeating Rutgers, West Virginia, Cincinnati and St. John’s — not among the highest-tier teams in the loaded Big East, but not the worst teams, either.

“This would be a game where you’d be mad and kicking yourself if you lost this one tonight,” Price said.
517 2009-01-16 The group’s chairman is Dick Armey, the former Republican House majority leader. A memorandum the group distributed to Congress on Thursday laid out its argument that “when Congress delegates so much authority to the executive branch with so few rules to guide its discretion, Congress unconstitutionally transfers its lawmaking power to the executive.”

The bailout’s sheer size, the memorandum states, takes it beyond the realm of other Congressional delegations of authority that have been found constitutional. “As far as we can tell, Congress has never delegated so much power to an executive agency with so little to constrain the agency’s discretion,” the memorandum concluded, calling the result “a classic violation of the nondelegation principle.”

The group has not said when it might file suit or whom the plaintiffs might be.

“We’re still sort of dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s on that,” FreedomWorks’ vice president for research, Wayne T. Brough, said.

The possible legal challenge was first reported by Bloomberg News.

Prof. Laurence H. Tribe, an expert on constitutional law at Harvard, said in an interview that such a challenge was unlikely to succeed because the doctrine of Congressional delegation, which flourished in the 1930s, was significantly weakened during the New Deal and never recovered.

The bailout, Professor Tribe said, “certainly tests the outer limits of Congressional delegation authority,” and “if the delegation doctrine were genuinely alive and well, TARP might be among its potential victims.”

But, he said, recent cases in which the Supreme Court approved broad delegations of authority made it clear that it was unlikely to intervene on constitutional grounds. As an example Professor Tribe cited the authority conveyed to the federal Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act.

Eric A. Posner, a professor of law at the University of Chicago law school, agreed.

“Not even this court,” with its bank of steadily conservative justices, is likely to revive the kinds of legal arguments of the 1930s, Professor Posner said.

“I would be extremely surprised,” he said, to see such an enormous legal shift, especially over a bill that focused on spending as opposed to broader issues.

Dr. Brough of FreedomWorks acknowledged that more than 70 years of jurisprudence and the structure of the government from the New Deal onward might pose a difficult barrier for his group to surmount. However, he said: “In our minds, this is probably the biggest intervention in the economy going back to then. It’s worth revisiting.”

He said that although the $700 billion was likely to have been spent before any challenge could make its way through the courts, the economy showed no signs of turning around, and there were more economic interventions on the way.

When that happens, Dr. Brough said, “it’s important that you can point to something and say, ‘Hey, guys, what you did last time was wrong.’ ”

Jim Manley, the chief spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he was unimpressed by the foundation’s argument.

“Taking economic advice from Dick Armey is akin to taking shooting lessons from Dick Cheney,” Mr. Manley said. “Neither are particularly helpful.”
518 2009-01-16 Analysts are quick to point out the strength of the company’s management bench. Timothy D. Cook, its longtime chief operating officer, will take over at least temporarily and is responsible for Apple’s manufacturing and sales operation, which are the envy of the consumer electronics industry. Jonathan Ive, Apple’s design chief, runs the team that has created much of the functional, visceral and emotional allure of Apple products, whose design ambitions extend right down to its elegant packaging.

But some Apple watchers and former employees are skeptical about Apple’s fate if it is forced to soldier on without Mr. Jobs.

“If you look at the history, Apple can coast for several years and still do very well,” said Paul Mercer, who worked for Apple in the 80s and subsequently developed software that was used to design the user interface for the first iPod. “But it’s very risky, and without Steve, the long term is untenable.”

The stories about Mr. Jobs are well known, like his insistence that even the insides of the Macintosh computer, which hardly anyone ever sees, should look good. His obsession with detail permeates everything Apple does, and that principle will certainly not disappear from the company if he is gone.

But there are other aspects of his role that do not get as much attention and may be more difficult to replace. At many technology companies, various divisions often work at cross purposes, competing with one other to develop related products. This can lead to devices and software that are sometimes incompatible, frustrating customers.

Mr. Jobs, former Apple employees say, has the authority and long-term vision to yoke Apple managers and employees together under a single cause.

“Steve is terrific at attracting and retaining people, creating an agenda and getting people to stick to it,” said Stephen G. Perlman, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who was a principal scientist at Apple in the 1980s. “It’s very hard to find somebody who is so credible, and who has such a strong following that he is able to cut through corporate politics.”

Mr. Jobs has also been Apple’s chief deal maker. After introducing the iTunes store in 2003, he persuaded entertainment companies to sell digital versions of their products when they were largely bivouacked, hiding in fear of piracy. In large part because of Mr. Jobs’s efforts, those barriers have fallen, though other challenges remain like getting the Hollywood studios to relax their restrictions on renting or downloading movies over the Internet.

In their moments of great anxiety, Apple fans look back to the late ’80s and early ’90s for a glimpse of Apple without Mr. Jobs. After he was ousted in a boardroom coup in 1985, Apple actually thrived for several years, unveiling the first Mac with a color screen, the PowerBook laptop and QuickTime, which broke ground in bringing video to personal computers.

But then, to the horror of its diehard fans, Apple withered. Its stock fell 68 percent from its 1991 peak to Mr. Jobs’s triumphant return in 1996.

In the meantime, three chief executives came and went, and Apple’s core product, the Macintosh, did not evolve as fast as computers based on Microsoft Windows.

Part of the problem, say people who were at Apple during the lean years, could be traced back to Mr. Jobs himself: he had not allowed anyone with talents similar to his own to rise at the company. Some think that may also be true today.

“Steve’s personality is such that he had not brought up other people who could do what he does. He’s the kind of person who pushes away people who are like himself,” said Ted Kaehler, who worked on the original team that developed the first graphical user interface at the research center known as Xerox Parc, and he later worked at Apple in the ’80s.

But some Apple watchers are reluctant to use the past as a guide. Andrew Hertzfeld, who helped develop the original Macintosh and now works at Google, says that Apple has had 12 more years under Mr. Jobs’s leadership to soak up his unique values.

He also notes that products already in the pipeline — which analysts say may include new iMacs and smaller iPhones — already bear Mr. Jobs’s imprint and can sustain Apple for years to come. “It will take half a decade for the absence of Steve to really show up in the products,” Mr. Hertzfeld said.

Some think Mr. Jobs’s imprint on Apple could last even longer, perhaps for decades, even if for some reason he is unable to come back in June. James W. Breyer, an influential Silicon Valley venture capitalist, sits on the board of Wal-Mart and says the values of its founder, Sam Walton, still drive the retailer 17 years after his death.

“I can’t recall a board meeting where Sam’s spirit and contribution have not been cited in some way,” Mr. Breyer said. “In the same way, I expect Steve Jobs, through his genius, will always represent the DNA of Apple.”

After the initial shock of Mr. Jobs’s letter sent Apple’s stock sharply lower in after-hours trading on Wednesday, investors were a little calmer on Thursday. The shares fell 2.3 percent to $83.38.

Still, there are those who worry that Mr. Jobs’s absence will have an impact even beyond Apple.

“The whole world is concerned about Apple. I’m concerned about Silicon Valley,” said Mr. Perlman, the entrepreneur. “I need Apple to be harrying Microsoft. We need someone stirring the pot. God forbid that there is no one stirring the pot anymore. We’ll become Detroit.”
519 2009-01-16 The Fed could ease all it wanted; the banks would not help.

But something has changed. The mortgage rate is now around 5 percent, while the AA-bond rate has fallen to just under where it was a year ago.

Those are still limited signs of a reviving credit market. There is no doubt that lending standards have tightened, and that some borrowers who could have gotten mortgage loans a year or two ago could not qualify now. Some may have perfectly good credit, but their homes are no longer worth what they owe. Others may fail to meet tougher income requirements, or discover that the cost of mortgage insurance has skyrocketed.

Nevertheless, many homeowners are hopeful. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported this week that its refinancing index — the volume of mortgage refinancing applications — reached 7,410. At the end of October, it was at 1,075.

It will be a few weeks, or maybe even months, before we find out how many of those mortgage loans are made. If few are, the claim that monetary policy is starting to work will have been premature, at best.

But if those loans are made in quantity, it could provide a big economic boost to supplement the stimulus package being prepared by the new administration.

“The grand deleveraging of consumers has to take place,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG.

One way for that to happen is for people to simply stop buying anything they do not absolutely need. The retail sales figures for December make it look as if a lot of that is happening.

“Alternatively,” Mr. Barbera said, “households can reduce debt service without having to slash spending. They can do that if they can refinance, and use some of the tax cuts to lower debt payments.”

It must be acknowledged that we risk running a two-tier recovery, in which the most creditworthy companies and consumers find loans cheap and the rest find them almost impossible to obtain.

Rates on bonds for corporations with lesser credit than AA — which is to say almost every company — have come down but not as rapidly, and new junk bond issues are still hard to sell at any yield. Corporate bankruptcies are rising, and that is likely to continue as companies face the need to refinance debt coming due.

Nor is the banking system yet healthy. The failure of the bank bailouts to stimulate more lending has been widely criticized, but that was not really the purpose of the bailouts. Instead, it was to recapitalize the industry and keep most of the banks alive. It turned out that some of them were in worse shape than anyone imagined.

Apparently, two of the biggest banks in the country, Citigroup and Bank of America, are in that category. Under what appears to be federal pressure, Citi is shrinking, while Bank of America is in line for another bailout to save it from what now appears to be a bad decision to grow by acquiring Merrill Lynch.

On Friday Citi will announce just how much red ink it found in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the week it unveiled a joint venture plan with Morgan Stanley for its brokerage business. (It will not, contrary to what jokesters immediately said, be known as Citi Morg.)

That joint venture plan is a model of accounting maneuverability. Citi will get $2.7 billion in cash from Morgan Stanley, but report a pretax profit of almost $10 billion. It can do that by estimating the value of both brokerage businesses, and then using those values to calculate the “profit.” That will improve its capital position, on the books if not in reality.

It’s not the giants only that are scrambling to make their capital look better. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle revealed this week that it will not have adequate capital when it files its year-end numbers. Some of the mortgage-backed securities it owns are not worth anything close to what it paid for them. As a result, if it was forced to mark all its assets to market value, as much as half of its capital might vanish.

You might think that evidence of such bad investing would lead to management’s offering to resign, or at least sounding apologetic. Instead, Richard M. Riccobono, the bank’s president, told me that “these market prices are not realistic” and should be ignored by regulators. He wants the capital rules to be changed as quickly as possible. It will be interesting to see how the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the newly created regulator, responds to that request.

All that scrambling helps to explain why banks as a group seem reluctant to lend very much, particularly to risky borrowers. They still are trying to find out just how bad their old assets really are, not to mention how much worse they will become as the recession deepens.

Imposing bailout rules to force banks to lend, and to limit dividends, as Congress is considering, may not be much help. It may be necessary, even if it sounds outrageous, for the government to take a lot of dubious assets off the banks’ books, paying more than they are worth. Perhaps then the banks would have confidence in their remaining assets, and the rest of us could have confidence in the banks.

Only then can we expect lending to really pick up, and it is hard to imagine this recession ending before that happens. “History demonstrates conclusively that a modern economy cannot grow if its financial system is not operating effectively,” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a speech in London this week.

Mr. Bernanke made it clear that the measure of the Fed’s success would be whether the high rates on risky loans come down to more reasonable levels. The recent rate declines on relatively safe loans is a tentative sign of progress, but there is still a long way to go before the credit markets are again operating adequately.
520 2009-01-16 The jail’s overhead surveillance video cameras captured everything. But another, hand-held camcorder turned on and off 13 times at a signal from the captain in charge, according to the report, created another version of the episode, apparently in an effort to document that Mr. Ng was faking his illness and refusing to go to the hospital for a CT scan.

Investigators interviewed 158 people in the course of their inquiry, but the surveillance videotapes clearly told them most of what they needed to know. At one point, they wrote, the captain cursed Mr. Ng, calling him an idiot, and ordered him to “stop whining.”

Mr. Ng kept saying that he could not walk, begged for a wheelchair, and “continued to scream,” the report said, as he was pulled under his armpits from his bed, and to another part of the jail to be shackled.

John J. McConnell Jr., the lawyer representing Mr. Ng’s family in a planned lawsuit against the jail and the federal immigration agency, called the report “damning” but added that the investigating agency shared the blame because Mr. Ng “should not have been detained in the first place.”

“The people involved in that torturous treatment,” he said, “should be ashamed of themselves.”

Dante Bellini, a spokesman for Wyatt, called the results of the investigation “disappointing.” Last month, citing its investigation, the immigration agency removed all of its detainees from Wyatt.

“We will continue to look at ways to reverse this,” Mr. Bellini said. “We will continue to look at all our options and filling our beds. But we will steadfastly maintain that we had nothing to do with the detainee’s death.”

Last week, Wyatt announced that it was punishing seven employees in connection with the case, with penalties ranging from termination to reprimand. “We took stern and appropriate action,” Mr. Bellini said.

Mr. Ng, who had no criminal record, overstayed a visa years ago and had been applying for a green card through his wife, a United States citizen, when he was taken into detention in July 2007 and shuttled through jails and detention centers in three New England states.

One of the most harrowing parts of the federal report is its detailed description of the videos made as Mr. Ng was forcibly taken from his cell to a van.

The tape from the hand-held camcorder begins with the captain’s instructing Mr. Ng that “he needed to move on his own,” telling him he would not be given a wheelchair and repeatedly ordering him to stand up.

“Mr. Ng was visibly crying and appeared to have difficulty standing,” the report said, adding that the captain then appeared to signal the officer holding the camcorder to stop recording.

“Mr. Ng asked captain to believe him that he could not move his legs,” the report went on. As he struggled to put on his shoes, apparently in pain, the captain urged him to hurry up. When Mr. Ng told a nurse that he wanted to go to the hospital to take the medical test to determine the cause of his pain and disability, but needed a wheelchair, she was dismissive: “She stated that he could go; he was just refusing to go.”
521 2009-01-16 “I am sure all of you saw my letter last week sharing something very personal with the Apple community. Unfortunately, the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well. In addition, during the past week I have learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought.”

This is how Steve Jobs’s opened a recent e-mail message to Apple employees also posted on the Apple Web site as a “media advisory”  announcing that the country’s best-known chief executive was planning to take a “medical leave” until June. And thus, in three short sentences, did Mr. Jobs instantly create yet more curiosity about his health.

Last week, he said he had a “hormone imbalance.” Now it’s “more complex” than that  whatever that means. If he really wants people to stop speculating about his health, as he claims, he sure has a funny way of dealing with it. Let’s be honest here: when you are a) a survivor of pancreatic cancer; and b) the world’s most charismatic, and possibly its most irreplaceable, corporate executive, putting out a press release announcing that your problems are “more complex” is only going to fan the flames, not douse them.

Last summer, during a previous spate of rumors about Mr. Jobs’s health  after he appeared at an Apple event looking unusually gaunt and pallid  he called me, quite angrily, because I was writing a column about whether he had a responsibility to shareholders to offer more disclosure about the state of his health. He said that he would tell me what was then bothering him  so long as we did it “off the record.” Feeling that I had no choice, I agreed to the terms.

I knew at the time I was being spun  he’s Steve Jobs, after all  but I didn’t think I was being lied to. Now, in the wake of this latest news, I’m not sure what to think. It is certainly possible that Mr. Jobs had the condition he described to me last summer. It is also possible that, more recently, he discovered he had a hormone imbalance. And that a week later, he certainly could have returned to the doctor and learned that his problem was bigger and more serious than that. I’ve talked to enough doctors who have dealt with pancreatic cancer to know that the operation Mr. Jobs underwent is life-altering. Simple medical problems can have debilitating effects on someone who has had his operation.

But at this point, Mr. Jobs has very little credibility when it comes to his own health. For years, he hid the fact that he had been treated for pancreatic cancer  and that Tim Cook, who is now going to run Apple while he is on leave, ran it then too. Although Mr. Jobs disagrees with me on this, that strikes me as a “material fact,” at least as the Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term. And his recent health revelations  such as they are  have only further impaired his credibility. Charlie Wolf, the Apple analyst at Needham & Company, wrote a note to clients describing Mr. Jobs’s e-mail message to Apple’s employees as “a can of worms.” He added, “The fact that Mr. Jobs did not resign nor did the board call for his resignation suggests that he may well be telling the truth.” The clear implication of that sentence suggests that many people (including, perhaps, Mr. Wolf) suspect that Mr. Jobs is not telling the truth.

In other words, the most indispensable chief executive in the United States, beloved by customers and investors for his magnificent turnaround of the company he founded  and for the amazing gadgets his company produces  can no longer be trusted on whether he is healthy enough to continue running the company. Although Mr. Jobs says he will return in June, Mr. Wolf wrote in his client note that investors were likely to “assume the worst  at the extreme, the possibility that Mr. Jobs will never return to Apple as full-time C.E.O.” In the past, whenever I called Mr. Wolf to ask about something Mr. Jobs had said  not just about his health, but his denial that he played a big role in the company’s options back-dating scandal, for instance  the analyst always took Mr. Jobs’s side. His note suggests that even he is starting to have his doubts.

It is really hard to write about Steve Jobs and his health problems. What you really want to do is root for him, not criticize him. Everybody  myself very much included  hopes that he will get well and come back to work. I can even understand why he doesn’t want to disclose details about his medical problems  it’s distasteful, and Mr. Jobs also believes strongly that it’s nobody’s business except his and his family’s.

But he’s wrong. There are certain people who simply don’t have the same privacy rights as others, whether they like it or not. Presidents. Celebrities. Sports figures. And, at least in terms of his health, Steve Jobs. Once again, his health is a material fact for Apple’s shareholders, and more disclosure is required. His vagueness about his health, his dissembling, his constantly changing story line  it is simply not an appropriate way to act when you are the most important person at one of the most prominent companies in the country. On the contrary: it is infuriating.

Enough is enough. If Mr. Jobs wants privacy, he should resign from Apple. If he did, of course, his health would no longer be anybody’s business but his own. Barring that radical move, Mr. Job’s medical problems will continue to be a “distraction,” as he himself put it in that recent e-mail message  and a big one. The time has come for Apple’s board to wrest control of this subject from Mr. Jobs, and do the right thing by the company’s shareholders. Say, once and for all, what is going on with Mr. Jobs’s health. Put the subject to rest. End the constant rumormongering. And then get back to the business of making the coolest products on earth.
522 2009-01-16 After personal entreaties from Mr. Obama, all but one of the seven Democratic freshmen senators voted to release the money, including Senators of and of , who as House members twice voted against the original bailout bill.

In a statement, the president-elect applauded the outcome.

“I know this wasn’t an easy vote because of the frustration so many of us share about how the first half of this plan was implemented,” Mr. Obama said. “Now my pledge is to change the way this plan is implemented and keep faith with the American taxpayer.”

, the incoming White House chief of staff who huddled with Republicans on Wednesday to make the case for the money, saw the outcome as the first major win for the new administration.

“Obviously we would have preferred something else,” Mr. Emanuel said. “But this was the first play of the game, and we threw an 80-yard pass.”

The House may still vote on the bailout money, but the point is moot because the law requires action by both chambers to block the funds. Instead, House Democrats said they could focus on their aggressive timetable for the $825 billion stimulus measure.

That package, developed in partnership with Mr. Obama, includes huge increases in spending on education, aid to states for costs, temporary increases in jobless benefits and a vast array of public works projects to create jobs.

The is the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s early agenda and seeks to make good on some of his signature campaign promises, including an income tax cut for most Americans earning less than $200,000 a year.

Under the plan, individuals would receive up to $500 and families up to $1,000. The money would be delivered through paychecks as a reduction in withholdings, and is intended to bolster consumer spending by giving a small lift to household pocketbooks.

Some of the other major components of the plan include $87 billion for a temporary increase in aid to states for Medicaid costs; $79 billion in aid to local school districts and public colleges to prevent cutbacks; $90 billion in infrastructure spending, and $54 billion to encourage energy production from renewable sources.

The Senate is developing its own version of the stimulus bill, and intense haggling is expected over the next few weeks. The House speaker, of , has said the bill must pass by mid-February or she will cancel the Presidents’ Day recess.

The House version, introduced by the Appropriations Committee chairman, Representative , Democrat of , contains the broad parameters expected in the final product: roughly $550 billion in spending and $275 billion in tax cuts over two years. The House is expected to vote on the bill the week of Jan 26.

Mr. Obey, at a news conference, said that without the recovery plan, Americans would face a dire recession and unemployment of 12 percent. He said that even such a huge stimulus might not be enough to stabilize the economy.

“You have to look at this bill as not a salvation for the economy by any means,” he said, sitting at his desk in the Capitol with a window behind him overlooking the Washington Monument. “It is simply the largest effort by any legislative body on the planet to try to take government action to prevent economic catastrophe, and even that may be insufficient.”

Mr. Obama is expected to travel to hard-hit on Friday to trumpet aspects of the plan, particularly the renewable energy provisions and the aid for struggling Americans, including a further extension of jobless benefits, new subsidies for the unemployed and an increase in food stamps.

Although Mr. Obama promised to collaborate with Republicans and consider all ideas, the draft proposal put forward emphasized mostly Democratic principles of helping middle-class workers with tax relief and helping the unemployed pay health care costs.

“This is the first time Republicans and the American people have seen any specifics on the proposal Congressional Democrats intend to pass, and what we’re seeing is disappointing,” the Republican leader, Representative of Ohio, said in a statement. “The plan released this morning by Congressional Democrats was developed with no Republican input and appears to be grounded in the flawed notion that we can simply borrow and spend our way back to prosperity.”

Mr. Boehner and other Republicans are planning to push for deeper and more permanent tax cuts that they say will do a better job of encouraging economic growth.

Among lawmakers in both parties, there has been substantial outrage on Capitol Hill over the Bush administration’s management of the bailout program. Some senators said the new worries over Citigroup and Bank of America had influenced their vote.

Many Republicans said they were angered that the administration had used the rescue money to help and , and they demanded assurances from the Obama administration that it would not similarly aid individual industries.

In urging senators to release the money, the majority leader, Senator of , gave an impassioned speech, focused on Mr. Obama. “We must give our new president every tool to try to fix this economy,” Mr. Reid said.

The Republican leader, Senator of , who voted against releasing the money, said he appreciated Mr. Obama’s assurances that the bailout program would be used to stabilize the financial system. But Mr. McConnell said, “the incoming administration also indicated it would use the money in ways I cannot support.”

Senator , Republican of , who supported the original bailout, voted against releasing the money.

Mr. Obama, in a meeting with the editorial board of The , said that he would convene a “fiscal responsibility summit” in February to focus on solving long-term problems with the economy, including the rising costs of Social Security and .

At his news conference, Mr. Obey said that the bill would create a board to oversee how the stimulus money was being spent and that money allocated under the recovery bill would be tracked on a new Web site.
523 2009-01-16 In a few weeks, a close comparison of radar tapes and cockpit audiotapes will establish where the plane was when that clipped, urgent conversation took place, and other investigators will try to figure out why this one plane, flying through some of the world’s most congested airspace, was the only one to report a bird problem. The twin-engine plane is supposed to be able to fly on one engine.

But from early indications, it appears the pilot handled the emergency river landing with aplomb and avoided major injuries, evacuating the plane, an Airbus A320, calmly in the middle of the river, passengers and officials said.

Airliners are not meant to glide, although occasionally they have to. The pilot of this one, Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III, is certified as a glider pilot, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.

Captain Sullenberger, known as Sully, flew the F-4 for the United States Air Force for seven years in the 1970s after graduating from the United States Air Force Academy. He joined USAir, as it was called at the time, in 1980 and became a “check airman,” training and evaluating new pilots or those changing to new aircraft or moving up to captain. He also was an accident investigator for the union, the Air Line Pilots Association.

Captain Sullenberger’s wife, Lorrie Sullenberger, a fitness expert in Danville, Calif., said she learned about the crash on Thursday afternoon when her husband called her. “I haven’t stopped shaking yet,” she said in a brief phone interview.

US Airways pilots can drill for water landings in a simulator, but no one knows how realistic that is. “You’re landing on a big blue screen,” said one US Airways A320 pilot, referring to the flat-panel computer screens in the simulator.

“Better to land at an airport where there’s actual crash-fire-rescue,” said the pilot, who requested anonymity because he did not have his airline’s permission to speak. But the pilot and other experts said the crew appeared to have done a good job.

Ditching can be tricky. The first step is to extend the slats and the flaps, the movable surfaces on the front and back edges of the wings that allow the plane to fly more slowly and to descend to just over the water’s surface.

Another step is to hit the “ditching button,” which seals the openings in the plane. One is the intake, where the engines grab air to pressurize and force it into the cabin, essential to high-altitude flight. Another is the valve at the back that lets air out.

When the plane is flying low enough, it will generate its own cushion of air, a phenomenon called “ground effect,” that lets it fly even more slowly.

“The whole point is to get the airplane slow, to minimize the damage and the forces on the airplane,” said John Cox, a safety consultant who flew the A320 for US Airways and USAir for six years. Mr. Cox said that he knew Captain Sullenberger and that he was “a seriously good aviator.”

While the plane slows, the crew has to be careful not to let it stall, which happens when the wind is flowing over the wings too slowly to generate enough lift. Mr. Cox said the plane would probably have touched down at 100 to 120 knots, roughly 115 to 140 miles per hour.

Ditching is different from landing a glider. Another safety expert, Arnie Reiner, who was a crash investigator for Pan American World Airways and later a pilot for the Delta Shuttle flights out of La Guardia, said the object was to keep the wings level and the nose up slightly, so the fuselage could plane on the water’s surface. Hit in a nose-down attitude, he said, and the plane could dig into the water, potentially damaging the fuselage heavily.

This one settled in with the nose high.
524 2009-01-16 “As you watch what is going on in the media landscape, it is incumbent on us to provide innovation,” said Kevin C. O’Malley, vice president and publisher of Esquire in New York, part of the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation.

“The single biggest question advertisers are asking is how to engage the reader,” Mr. O’Malley said. “Something like this serves up that engagement factor.”

Interestingly, neither Mr. O’Malley nor a member of his sales staff came up with the idea for the cover window. The concept was the brainchild of the editor in chief of Esquire, David Granger.

“Everybody keeps talking about how print is an old medium,” Mr. Granger said, pausing before continuing: “It is an old medium, but it doesn’t mean it’s a wrung-out medium or a tired medium.”

Seeking ways to encourage readers “to interact with the magazine,” Mr. Granger said, he has visited the Hearst manufacturing division and asked to be shown “what the potential of print is.”

“At least half the people in manufacturing had never met an editor in chief before,” he added, laughing.

That was followed by visits to five or so companies that work with the manufacturing division, Mr. Granger said, like R. R. Donnelley, Quad/Graphics and Vertis Communications. The concept for the cover window, also called a trap door, is from Donnelley, and the design of the pull-tab cover is by Vertis.

Including ads with those new types of covers was necessary, Mr. Granger said, because “the reality of the world is that if I want to do things that are adventurous editorially, to pay for them we have to find partners to share costs.”

For the cover window in the February issue, Discovery Channel, part of Discovery Communications, came aboard for several reasons. One is that the channel regularly advertises in Esquire. Another reason is timing; the first episode of “One Way Out” is scheduled for Jan. 26.

And “the fact we’re the first to do it is intriguing,” said John Ford, president and general manager at Discovery Channel in Silver Spring, Md., because “we’re always looking for outlets in media that give us great platforms to promote our programs.”

“In a year like this, with ad dollars so tight,” he added, marketers are “going to say, ‘If I’m going to spend, I’m going to get more for it.’ ”

Mr. Ford and James Hitchcock, senior vice president for marketing and branding at Discovery Channel, said they would have turned down the opportunity to buy the cover window ad if they had deemed the idea too cute or coy.

“I think you can smell a gimmick a mile away,” Mr. Hitchcock said. “If the strategy is showing, we avoid it.”

Similarly, at Esquire, Mr. O’Malley said, there was an effort to “execute this the right way” and insure “the format doesn’t cross any line” and upset readers by blurring the distinction between editorial content and advertising.

To that end, the ad on the left side of the opened cover window carries the Discovery Channel logo and the quotations on the right side appear under the Esquire logo.

As for blurring the distinction between editors and publishers at Esquire, Mr. O’Malley described himself as fortunate to work with someone like Mr. Granger who is committed enough to the magazine to care about the business operations.

When proposals are editorially driven, Mr. O’Malley said, “there’s a great opportunity to partner” with him and others on the business side to bring in advertisers.

To be sure, not every special issue makes for special results. For instance, the October issue of Esquire, which celebrated the magazine’s 75th anniversary, carried 170 ad pages, the most for an October issue. But ad pages for Esquire for all of 2008 fell 14.2 percent from 2007, according to the publishers bureau.

But Esquire had company in its misery. Of the more than 230 magazines tracked by the publishers bureau that are still being published, the trade publication Folio reported on Tuesday, only 42 were able to sell more ad pages last year than they did the year before.
525 2009-01-16 President-elect Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Homeland Security Department breezed through a confirmation hearing on Thursday that one senator called a “warm and fuzzy” experience.

The nominee, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, offered few specifics at the two-and-one-half-hour hearing, while promising to safeguard the country from terrorists, protect its borders and strengthen the six-year-old department.

Ms. Napolitano told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that the department had moved to shape itself into a cohesive agency created from more than 22 parts. But, she said, “our work is not finished.”

“To secure the homeland,” she said, “means to protect our nation’s borders by finding and killing roots of terrorism and stop those who intend to hurt us, to wisely enforce the rule of law at our borders, to protect our national cyber infrastructure, and to prepare for and respond to natural and man-caused disasters with speed, skill and effectiveness.”

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who heads the committee, praised Ms. Napolitano as a “superb choice.” Although the agency’s performance had improved, Mr. Lieberman said, “there were still those who believed D.H.S. should be chopped up and its parts shipped off to other agencies.”

“I believe that is exactly the wrong way to go,” he added.

Ms. Napolitano seemed to agree, saying she would “take the organization that is here and make it better as opposed to moving around a lot of boxes on an organization chart.”

Her genial bipartisan welcome began with her introduction, as a Democrat, by Arizona’s two Republican senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain. Mr. McCain said Ms. Napolitano would bring her “no nonsense” approach as governor to the Obama cabinet.

But it was Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who seemed to capture the hearing’s mood when she told Ms. Napolitano, “It’s all going to be warm and fuzzy today,” although she warned that after Ms. Napolitano’s widely expected confirmation there would be few such moments.
526 2009-01-16 As recently as last off-season, McNabb lobbied Eagles officials for a playmaker. He had that one notable exception, Terrell Owens, back in 2004 and part of 2005. Their testy relationship devolved into a soap opera that nevertheless culminated in a Super Bowl appearance.

Before Owens arrived and after he departed, the receiver position here was mocked and criticized and labeled as the team’s primary problem.

This season, the trend seemed certain to continue. The Eagles began 2008 missing their top two receivers from the year before. Kevin Curtis missed the first six games with a sports hernia injury. Reggie Brown never seemed to recover from an injured hamstring. As usual, the Eagles’ most dangerous receiver was actually a running back — the speedy, shifty Brian Westbrook.

Despite the position’s history, despite the injuries to an already underwhelming core, McNabb passed for a career-high 3,916 yards this season. DeSean Jackson, the team’s second-round pick last April, had 912 receiving yards, but indicative of the group’s balance, no other receiver reached 450 yards.

The Eagles’ receivers are not the fastest, or the most sure-handed. But against Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, McNabb threw for more than 300 yards while no receiver accounted for more than 50.

“What you’re seeing is Eagles football,” McNabb said.

In late November, Reid benched McNabb against Baltimore. McNabb returned and what followed was a run of six victories in seven games. But while most of the attention focused on McNabb’s play, those who follow the Eagles noticed an equally important but more subtle shift.

After the Eagles lost to the Ravens, Reid and the team’s offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, tightened the rotation at receiver. Brown and Greg Lewis had their roles reduced, while Jackson, Avant, Curtis and Hank Baskett had their roles clarified.

“That was one of the smarter things that Andy has done,” said Ike Reese, a former Eagles linebacker who is the host of a Philadelphia radio show. “He helped those guys lean on each other. After Baltimore, you could see a difference in Andy’s approach. It wasn’t just the difference in McNabb’s play.”

Still, the Eagles’ receiver rotation remains relatively anonymous. Baskett may be the most famous, and only because he is engaged to Kendra Wilkinson, the Playboy playmate from the television show “The Girls Next Door.”

The undersize Jackson packs promise onto his 5-foot-10, 175-pound frame. The fastest of the group, he caught 10 passes that gained 25 yards or more this season, while erasing concerns that his ego would match the one Owens brought to Philadelphia.

Avant became the Eagles’ top conversion option, with 15 of his 32 catches coming on third down. He runs fearless routes across the middle of the field, making grabs in heavy traffic despite persistent concerns about his speed. Curtis eventually recovered from the sports hernia to work back into the rotation.

And still, despite their productivity, these receivers are most often referred to as solid, not spectacular. Some of them look at “solid” as a backhanded compliment, like saying a blind date has a great personality or telling a chef his food tasted better than it looked.

“Looked at like bottom of the barrel, so to speak,” Lewis said.

Of course, solid beats the alternative from years past. After the Owens train wreck, after years of McNabb begging for the playmaker who never came, the Eagles continue to fill the air with footballs. Only now are they landing in capable, if not anonymous, hands.
527 2009-01-16 At a middle school in Austin, Tex., a young history teacher plans to use the hip-hop song “Black President” as a spark for an Inauguration Day discussion of politics and patriotism.

In an elementary school in Covington, Ky., kindergarten students will write congratulatory letters to the new president. And in Detroit, young students will dance and dine with teachers and parents at an inaugural ball of their own.

The inauguration of America’s first African-American president has captured the imagination of students and educators with an intensity that surpasses previous ceremonies, and schools from New Hampshire to Florida to California are working to bring the excitement and pageantry, the sheer history of it all, to life in the classroom.

After millions of students watch Barack Obama take the presidential oath on television, some will recite poetry, many will hear brass bands play patriotic music and not a few will debate whether Mr. Obama’s oratory equaled the eloquence of John F. Kennedy.

“We are totally committed to reading, writing, science and history,” said Linda Lane, deputy superintendent of instruction in Pittsburgh. “But we also know that some history doesn’t come out of a book. Some history you get to be part of.”

Karen Rusche, principal of Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic school in Cincinnati, decided that the inaugural was of such historic import that her eighth graders would interrupt a spiritual retreat to watch it on TV.

“We don’t want to see it on a rerun,” Ms. Rusche said. “We want to be witnesses to the historical moment.”

Students from hundreds of schools across the nation are heading to Washington to participate in the inauguration. But thousands of students in Oakland, Calif., and the surrounding communities will get their own close-up view of the celebration. They will ride buses at dawn to the Oracle Arena, an auditorium adjacent to the Oakland Raiders’ home field, to watch the inauguration on a stadium-size screen, said Miguel Dwin, a school board trustee in Emeryville, Calif.

Educators in Chicago, Mr. Obama’s hometown, may be among the most enthusiastic.

Like many school districts nationwide, Chicago produced a lengthy guide to help teachers tailor instruction to the inauguration, with suggestions for essay themes, debate topics and letter-writing. Arne Duncan, the Chicago schools chief whom Mr. Obama has nominated to be secretary of education, sent a memorandum introducing the guide to the city’s teachers.

“Barack Obama has captivated Chicago students’ interest in democracy,” he said. “As educators, we cannot let this teaching opportunity pass us by.”

Not all students, of course, interpret the significance of Mr. Obama’s election in the same way. At Malcolm Elementary School in Laguna Niguel, Calif., Elisa Slee had her first graders write letters to Mr. Obama and essays describing what they would do if they were president.

Ms. Slee said that one girl wrote, “I would put a soccer field in my bedroom.”

Students in Washington have front seats on the festivities. Schools in the District of Columbia traditionally close on Inauguration Day, partly because busing becomes untenable as out-of-towners snarl traffic. But in a sign that schools are bubbling with more enthusiasm for this inaugural, a dozen districts in northern Virginia, Maryland and southern New Jersey, including in Baltimore and Camden, N.J., have also decided to close.

In Montgomery County, Md., north of Washington, Superintendent Jerry D. Weast recommended staying open on Tuesday. But after thousands of people signed an online petition on Facebook urging an inaugural holiday, the school board voted unanimously to close.

Christopher Barclay, an African-American member of Montgomery’s school board, said he had sponsored the resolution because this year’s inaugural had incredible significance. “Some people said, ‘You could just use the day to teach,’ ” Mr. Barclay said. “Yes, but we could also take the day off and let people participate.”

The Philadelphia schools superintendent, Arlene Ackerman, decided to stay open after a debate with members of her staff, half of whom thought schools should close, she said.

“In the end, we came down for keeping schools open because it’s a teachable moment, and not all parents have access to quality day care,” she said. “And schools can make this historic event an experience they’ll never forget.”

Not all schools and districts are taking special notice. In rural Waynoka, Okla., a state that voted heavily for Mr. Obama’s presidential rival, Senator John McCain, for instance, Schools Superintendent Dale Ross said that he had heard few expressions of interest in the inauguration.

Stacy Haskins, a civics teacher at Waynoka’s lone school, which has 250 students, from kindergarten to high school, said, “We may just watch a few clips of it and then move on.”

Kriner Cash, the superintendent in Memphis, where 86 percent of students are black, sent a memorandum last week encouraging teachers to incorporate the ceremony into their instruction. But suburban districts around Memphis, Mr. Cash said, have been quiet on the issue.

“I don’t like to speculate,” he said, “but I think it’s because it is a partisan issue for parents. They didn’t win. But I say, ‘Get over it.’ ”

Still, even in areas like Orange County, Calif., which tend to vote Republican and where many students wore McCain T-shirts to school during the campaign, inaugural enthusiasm has bubbled forth.

“Partisanship, that’s over,” said Martha McIntosh, chairwoman of the social sciences department at Dana Hills High School. “All my little McCain-ites are excited about the inauguration.”

And so are many students who often seem to find everything about school boring. At the Dobie Middle School in Austin, Jason Hayes, who teaches history, said it had been easier to engage his students during the election season.

“Even the so-called hardcore gangster kids actually do know what’s going on and are interested in presidential politics,” Mr. Hayes said. “It’s been great for me. Not a lot of students usually are interested in history.”
528 2009-01-16 PARK CITY, Utah — In the lobby of the Park City Marriot, a rustic/modern hotel that serves as the headquarters of the Sundance Film Festival, on Wednesday afternoon, it did not seem that the movie industry exuded much glamour. Filmmakers who had survived the intense competition and made it into this year’s festival, which opened Thursday night and will run until Jan. 25, were stuck in a huge queue waiting for their luggage and vans to take them to their quarters. But there were no hissy fits or attitude because, as the phrase goes, they (and their posses) were just happy to be here.

Although Sundance has its share of celebrity heat — hey, look, isn’t that Jim Carrey talking to Zooey Deschanel? — there is still a D.I.Y. ethic afoot. For every movie star flanked by minders with waiting black S.U.V.’s, there are dozens of filmmakers schlepping overstuffed backpacks who have sucked their friends and relatives’ bank accounts dry to reach this magical kingdom. It is a place where everyone cares about good movies.

Though the Golden Globes-Screen Actors Guild-Oscars circuit and the independent film community seem to inhabit different planets, the twain often meets. The Coen brothers, who won the best picture Oscar last year for “No Country for Old Men,” were part of the first Sundance 25 years ago with “Blood Simple,” which won the Grand Jury Prize. And more recently, Sundance favorites like “Little Miss Sunshine” and “An Inconvenient Truth” have found themselves in the thick of the awards season.

This year’s award-circuit darling, “Slumdog Millionaire,” may not be a Sundance movie in the clinical sense, but in terms of aesthetic and appeal it hits all the buttons with its innovative shooting style, a cast of nobodies and a backdrop in India. Audiences who are now walking past all manner of studio fare and lining up for this film could not be blamed for wondering, “Why aren’t there more movies like this?”

It’s complicated, but worth thinking about. Movies are a collaborative exercise that requires a huge capital investment based on known commodities, so to get a movie made it is often more important who is in it than what it’s about. Think about it: if you were a director walking around with a movie that was not only set in Mumbai but also took the city as one of its main characters, how do you think that would play on the studio lot? And by the way, the two lead characters are played by young actors you’ve never heard of. And don’t forget to mention that one-third of the movie is actually in Hindi.
529 2009-01-16 “That is a pretty good deal,” said Ms. Rice, 44, whose husband, two young children and parents were seated behind her. The United States pays 27 percent of the roughly $7 billion annual budget for peacekeeping, which includes around 90,000 soldiers in 16 different missions. It also pays 22 percent of the overall budget, the largest single contribution.

Ms. Rice said the costs of no action or unilateral action in many crises was too high, so the answer was to make peacekeeping more effective. The previous administration intervened periodically she said, but had not pursued it in a sustained or collective fashion. “This is not a challenge for the United States alone,” she said.

Ms. Rice called it “patently unacceptable” that the United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur had only just reached half its strength, more than a year after it was formed, largely by underequipped units from the African Union.

The prospective ambassador has been quoted extensively saying that she would never allow a situation like the genocide in Rwanda to occur again, so she was asked several times how she would confront the government in Sudan over the killing in Darfur as well as other crises in Africa. Ms. Rice said she thought the United States could muster more support from countries like China and Russia on Sudan or Zimbabwe or other issues by emphasizing through quiet diplomacy where the interests of great powers converge with those of the region.

“It is not uncommon to hear quite moving speeches in the halls of the Security Council,” she said, but that was to often followed by a “deficit of determination” to hold dictators like Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe to account for their actions.

The hearings ranged widely, touching on virtually every trouble spot in the world including the Congo, Somalia, Burma and North Korea. Given the fact that the Middle East is again up in flames, it was striking that no senators raised the question of the fighting in Gaza until some two hours into the nearly three-hour hearing. When two finally did, it was in the context of what to do to stop Hamas firing rockets into Israel — none mentioned the heavy civilian toll among the Palestinian population.

It was Ms. Rice herself who brought up the humanitarian crisis, noting that the incoming Obama administration was greatly concerned about “the suffering of innocents” and on a broader scale determined to forge ahead with a two-state solution.

“There needs to be a durable cease-fire, but a durable cease-fire has to entail the halt to Hamas rockets against Israel and the Israeli people,” she said, adding that including effective measures to control weapons smuggling into Gaza and an effective means to control the border. Once the fighting ended, she said, “We need to mount a swift and robust effort to attend to the dire humanitarian needs inside Gaza.”

Many senators, especially from the Republican side, expressed concern that the United Nations was shutting down an independent unit that had conducted corruption investigations over the past two years in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal. Ms. Rice expressed her support for continued efforts to reform the organization and root out corruption, but said the effort should be transferred to an internal auditor.
530 2009-01-16 A picture last Friday with an article about the declining prices for second homes in the Catskills was published in error. It showed the entrance to Kenoza Lake Estates, a development in Sullivan County — not the Highlands at Bethel, a development nearby.
531 2009-01-16 "I think it is an incredible advantage to be able to make these investments in this environment," said Stacy J. Smith, chief financial officer at Intel, in an interview. “If others slow down, that just benefits us.”

Auguste P. Richard, a chip analyst with Piper Jaffray, said Intel had ratcheted down the production of processors at its current chip manufacturing plants, known as fabs, but was continuing to spend money on building plants.

“Intel is not going to let up on that, and no one else can keep up,” Mr. Richard said. “Intel’s competitive advantage is their manufacturing and not design, and that’s how they maintain profits and market share.”

Intel has laid the groundwork for a fresh assault on the mobile device market with the Atom processor, which today goes into inexpensive laptops known as netbooks and which will eventually sit inside smartphones. In addition, Intel wants to play a larger role in the consumer electronics market, with chips for televisions and other gadgets, and to enter the high-end graphics processor market.

Those forays put Intel up against competitors like Samsung and Texas Instruments. Intel is betting that it can gain an edge on these companies by shifting to a more advanced chip manufacturing process this year, which will allow it to make cheaper, less power-hungry products.

The plants to build those new products will consume the majority of Intel’s capital spending in 2009. “We are going to get there as fast as we possibly can,” Mr. Smith said.

The new facilities should also help Intel compete with more traditional rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. Both of those companies have forecast sharp declines in fourth-quarter revenue and are in the midst of restructuring their operations. A.M.D. has created a company to handle its chip-making needs so that it can focus on the design of products. Meanwhile, Nvidia recently laid off 6.5 percent of its work force and is trying to finance new products in the mobile and server markets.

It could be tough for the companies to navigate their transitions and keep up with Intel.

“In this economy, it’s difficult to run a company that is well positioned, let alone one with structural challenges,” said Ross Seymore, a chip analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, in relation to A.M.D. “I don’t envy their position.”

According to analysts following the PC industry, Intel and its peers are trying to cope with a pullback in orders from their channel partners and retailers that sell computers. Many of these companies were hurt by the credit crisis and were forced to reduce their inventory and curtail future orders.

“There is nothing going on right now,” Mr. Richard said. “This is as dark and deep as it goes, with companies not buying or selling anything.”

Gartner, a technology research firm, said the global PC market grew last quarter at its slowest rate in six years, just 1.1 percent, in part because of a sharp drop-off in sales to customers in the United States.

Intel’s results reflect the depth of the slump. In the last 25 years, Intel has faced a year-over-year revenue drop of this magnitude in the fourth quarter only twice — during the dot-com bust in 2001 and in 1985.

To deal with waning demand, Intel will pull back on capacity at its existing factories and try to keep cutting costs elsewhere in the business. Citing economic uncertainty, Intel declined to provide a first-quarter revenue forecast, although it warned that gross profit margins would decline significantly.

Shares of Intel were up more than 1 percent during Thursday’s trading, ending at $13.29.
532 2009-01-16 As with other living donor transplants I would witness in the future, the brother’s kidney began to function in his sister’s body within minutes of connecting the vessels. Clear yellow fluid squirted out against our instruments as we tried to suture the ureter to the bladder.

It was, I remember thinking that morning, a gift of life.

But it’s a gift, according to some, that can be assessed for as much as $1.5 million or as little as $20,000 or less.

Since the 1984 passage of the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, it has been illegal to buy and sell organs. Nonetheless, there was no mistaking the assumption underlying the coverage of the Batista case: an organ is a commodity.

It is hardly headline news anymore that kidneys and livers are available for a price. But what has been particularly worrisome about the Batista case is the ease with which that topic has gone from black market alleyways to local courthouses and national media. What should have been outrage over putting a dollar value on a human organ became curiosity over the accusations and the pictures of those involved. Many of us reading, listening to and even writing about the story — myself included — accepted the premise long enough to wonder how Dr. Batista and his “medical expert” came up with that high a figure or if it was even physiologically possible for him to take back the kidney.

In the 25 years since NOTA was passed, all of us, doctor and patient, have become more comfortable with money’s role in medicine. It is routine now to assess the quality of health care by parameters like cost containment, increased efficiency and relative value units, or R.V.U.’s (the widget-equivalent of a doctor’s time and effort). Increasingly, we refer to patients as “clients” and “cases,” to doctors and clinicians as “service providers,” and to the very act of giving care as a commodity that can be graded, rated and quantified.

There’s no question that some of these business metrics are good for medicine and for patient care. But perhaps, as the Batista case has revealed, we have become so comfortable with money in medicine that we have downgraded once horrifying taboos to fodder for entertaining chatter and calculations.

In order to restore medicine’s compassion, doctors and patients need to reestablish the balance between cost containment and compassionate care, profit-and-loss tabulations and patient-centered partnerships. We need to give money its proper due but remember that our work, and our worth, is and can be more than the monetary sum of parts. We need to begin, as the Batista case has shown us, by looking critically at our own assumptions about what we value and how we value it. Or else we risk putting even our most priceless gifts at peril.
533 2009-01-16 Gallego and her husband, Al, frequent estate sales around Fresno, Calif., acquiring truckloads of antiques or just plain junk out of people’s attics and cellars. They sort it out later at their shop, Collectique.

Last summer, the Gallegos were going through their accumulation, posting items on eBay, when she spotted a rectangular card, somewhat mussed, with a photograph of 10 dashing young men in uniforms.

The lads could have been the Fighting A’s of Oakland of the 1970s, who had mustaches and attitude, but the card definitely said Red Stocking B. B. Club of Cincinnati, and she knew it was a bit older than the 1970s. She put it up for auction at $10.

Al and Bernice Gallego did not get to be 80 and 72 without acquiring some smarts. When the kindly folks out there in Webland seemed a trifle eager to take the card off their hands, the Gallegos took the card off the market and went to discover just exactly what they had.

Turns out, this is probably the oldest baseball card in history. The Cincinnati Red Stockings were merely the first professional baseball team on this continent, or probably any other. Bat and ball games had been played in many parts of the world, but baseball evolved in the northeastern United States in the 1830s and ’40s. According to “Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball” by Warren Goldstein, right after the Civil War, an attorney, Aaron B. Champion, assembled 10 amateurs in Cincinnati, gave them uniforms and paid them $800 or more a season, a respectable yearly wage for that time.

The 1869 Red Stockings were undefeated, winning an estimated 65 games, including league games and exhibitions, with one tie against the Troy Haymakers.

That year a card was distributed as an advertisement for Peck & Snyder, a New York manufacturer of both firefighting and sports equipment.

The Red Stockings had only one homegrown player, recruiting the others from back East, including Harry Wright, who had been born in England to a cricket player who immigrated to the United States. Wright helped recruit other players who lived in boarding houses, practiced regularly, wore red-trimmed uniforms and were expected to shun tobacco and alcohol and eat healthy diets — just like our worthies of today.

Wright’s best player was his kid brother, George Wright, who was paid the high salary of $1,400. The Red Stockings used the growing railroad system to barnstorm from coast to coast. In midseason they went to dinner at the White House, guests of President Ulysses S. Grant.

As Bernice Gallego is discovering, the tale of the Red Stockings has a thoroughly modern twist to it. In 1870, they won 27 more straight games but then lost to the Brooklyn Atlantics, which ended their mystique almost immediately.

Attendance dropped, the team could not make a profit, and the Wright brothers took their red stockings and moved to — oh, but you guessed it — Boston. The Peck & Snyder baseball cards went into the shoebox of oblivion.

The Gallegos have no idea where they got the card. They have been told by collectible experts that the card will be worth well into five figures, perhaps even $100,000, depending on the economy. Jay Leno’s people and Martha Stewart’s people have been requesting appearances. The auction will be scheduled for later this year, in Fresno. (The find was first reported by Mike Osegueda in The Fresno Bee.)

“Antique dealers are born pack rats; we save rubber bands on door knobs,” Bernice Gallego said on the phone, her voice husky, her tone worldly. This will not be the biggest jackpot of their career. In 1998, she said, she won $250,000 playing quarter slots at Tahoe. “I paid off our mortgage and some other debts and bought some antiques and we put in a swimming pool, but we didn’t stop working and I didn’t buy a mink coat or anything like that,” she said.

Plus, it enabled them to make a few runs to Las Vegas, where, she said, “I put some of it back.”

The Red Stockings card, under lock and key, will not change their lives. It might encourage a trip to a ballpark.

“I’m learning why people care so intensely,” Gallego said. “I can now understand why people collect baseball cards.”

Collecting is understandable. Throwing cards out is not so understandable. At least one shoebox has ended up in a mother’s hands. It seems only right.
534 2009-01-16 It remains to be seen how quickly she will be able to fulfill her agenda. While the current crisis provides political opportunities to push for change, many of her proposals were similar to those made years ago by a former S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, that were successfully challenged by major corporate and Wall Street interests and by other Republican commissioners.

Appearing at her confirmation hearing before a Senate banking committee that warmly embraced her selection, Ms. Schapiro had no difficulty rebuffing the tepid criticism raised by some senators that she had been a “safe choice” and that her career record as a regulator indicated she had not taken on many significant or large cases. Cognizant of the political dynamics that have taken hold of a capital grappling with a global financial crisis, Ms. Schapiro vowed to move swiftly to reinvigorate a deeply demoralized enforcement program and overhaul the regulatory apparatus.

“There are many reasons for this crisis — and one of them is that our regulatory system has not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors,” Ms. Schapiro testified. “It is precisely during times like this that we need an S.E.C. that is the investor’s advocate — that has the staff, the will and the resources necessary to move with great urgency to bring transparency and accountability to all corners of the marketplace, to vigorously prosecute those who have broken the law and cheated investors, and to modernize our country’s regulatory system to match the realities of today’s global, interdependent markets.”

Ms. Schapiro is the top official at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees Wall Street regulation on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finra was created from the merger two years ago of the regulatory arms of the New York Stock Exchange and NASD, which she had led after leaving government in 1996.

She dismissed concerns that both Finra and NASD had failed to detect the Ponzi scheme linked to Bernard Madoff Securities, saying that neither agency ever received any tips and that any enforcement shortcomings were a reflection of the “stovepipe approach” to the oversight of Wall Street.

She also rejected concerns that Finra had often fined small companies for minor violations rather than taking on larger companies and bigger problems.

“I have never been afraid to go after people who I feel violated the public trust,” she said. “There are absolutely no sacred cows.”

She said she was committed to overhauling the enforcement program and would reconsider procedures adopted during the Bush administration that make it more difficult for the enforcement staff to bring cases or levy large fines. She also said that she would create a more coordinated process to handle tips and whistle-blowers and that she would revive a risk assessment office proposed by Mr. Donaldson to study the markets for future risks.

Even as they criticized current regulators for failing to detect many of the problems of Wall Street, Democrats and Republicans on the committee rushed to support Ms. Schapiro’s nomination.

“You’re extremely well qualified for this job,” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the committee.

Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, said that she “would bring solid experience to the table during a time of economic and regulatory uncertainty.”

In response to questions, Ms. Schapiro indicated that she would be facing many of the same issues that had frustrated predecessors. She said she supported changing the regulations to require the registration of all hedge funds. That proposal, approved by a deeply divided commission under the leadership of Mr. Donaldson, was ultimately reversed by a federal appeals court and opposed by the Bush administration.

In another area where corporate interests have successfully blocked changes in recent years, she said that she would reopen the debate over whether to make it easier for dissenting shareholders to propose and elect a slate of directors.

And she said she was committed to quickly examining whether to restore the uptick rule, which was repealed by the commission in 2007. The rule prohibits short-sellers, who borrow stock and sell it in the hope of making a profit when it declines, from trading on shares when they are declining.
535 2009-01-16 The Star Tribune suspended making payments on its major debt in September, and company executives have said that excluding those payments, it turns a narrow profit.

The Newspaper Guild released a statement after the filing noting that since the new owners took over, the paper’s employees have made significant concessions and were prepared to make more, but it wasn’t enough.

“It’s unfortunate that a New York-based private equity company has put the Twin Cities largest source of news and information at risk,” Graydon Royce, co-chairman of the Newspaper Guild said in the statement. The guild represents almost 300 employees of the paper, mostly in its newsroom.

The Star Tribune will continue publishing during a bankruptcy, trying to restructure its debts and labor contracts.

In another corner of the industry, employees of The Rocky Mountain News waited to learn whether their paper would survive. Its owner, the E. W. Scripps Company, said last month that it would shut down The News if it could not sell the paper by mid-January. Analysts and industry executives said that given the near-total lack of buyer interest in newspapers, that made it very likely that The Rocky, as it is known, would go out of business.

Late Wednesday night, the company said it would entertain offers for the Denver-based paper through the close of business Friday.

As of midweek, a company executive said, several potential buyers had expressed interest and looked at the books of The Rocky, which Scripps said lost $11 million in the first nine months of last year, but none had yet quoted a price or submitted a formal offer. It was not clear Thursday whether that had changed.

Also Thursday, The Boston Globe announced that it would reduce its news staff by about 12 percent, or 50 people, through buyouts and possible layoffs, continuing a pattern of sharp contraction across the industry.

The Globe has a news staff of about 433 “full-time equivalents,” including 379 full-time employees, said Robert M. Powers, a spokesman for the paper. Earlier this decade, it had well over 500.

Only full-time workers will be eligible for the buyout, and if there are not enough voluntary resignations, the paper said it would resort to layoffs. The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Company, did not disclose the buyout terms.

“We have had to adjust before to a difficult financial picture, and we now must do it again,” the editor, Martin Baron, wrote in a message to his staff.

The Globe had weekday circulation of 324,000 last year, the 14th largest in the country, but that is down 30 percent since 2000. The paper’s Internet site, Boston .com, often ranks among the top six or seven newspaper sites in monthly traffic.
536 2009-01-16 The price of wholesale goods in the United States dropped in December as the spreading recession continued to reduce the demand for a range of products.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday that the producer price index fell 1.9 percent in December, its fifth consecutive monthly decline, after a 2.2 percent drop in November. The price of finished goods fell 0.9 percent for 2008, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in 2007.

Wholesale and consumer prices have slid back sharply in the downturn as oil prices collapsed, raising fears among some economists that the economy is nearing deflation, a cycle of declines in prices and wages.

The government said that gas prices fell by 25.7 percent last month and liquefied petroleum gas fell 21.8 percent as overall energy prices dropped 9.3 percent. Lower energy costs cut prices for a range of products, including fertilizers, rubber and steel.

Food prices posted the sharpest drop of the year in December, falling 1.5 percent from a month earlier, and energy costs fell 9.3 percent. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent last month. Core inflation was up 4.3 percent for the year.

The cost of cars rose 1.2 percent in December.

Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims rose 54,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 524,000, a sign of more turmoil for American workers. Unemployment has risen to 7.2 percent since the United States slipped into a recession in December 2007, and economists say it could crest at 9 percent or more.

“The experience of previous deep recessions suggests claims are nowhere near their peak, and we doubt that peak will be reached before the fall,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note.

The four-week average, which smoothes out fluctuations, fell by 8,000, to 518,500, last week.

539 2009-01-17 A look at the language of presidential inaugural addresses. The most-used words in each address appear in the interactive chart below, sized by number of uses. Words highlighted in yellow were used significantly more in this inaugural address than average. ( Related Article
540 2009-01-17 Right now you may be asking yourself: How am I going to celebrate ’s ?

You may, of course, have something else on your mind entirely. Like what the chances are that the next time you get on a plane, geese could fly into both engines. Or what the heck geese are doing in New York in the middle of winter when their relatives who worked hard and played by the rules had all gone south months ago.

Or you may just be wondering how that rescue in the Hudson River would have gone if it had been led off by the rather than New York Waterway’s director of ferry operations.

I can’t help you, people. Today I am on inauguration duty.

While there is some debate about the best inaugural address in history, it’s pretty clear that the worst was the one delivered by William Henry Harrison, who went thwacking through a tangled thicket of classical allusions for an hour and 45 minutes. (Harrison’s editor, Daniel Webster, claimed it could have been worse, and that he had killed off “seventeen Roman proconsuls, as dead as smelts.”) The weather was terrible; Harrison came down with a cold, then and was dead within a month.

Given current beaten-down expectations, our normal approach to Tuesday’s address would be to wander around muttering “well as long as it’s better than William Henry Harrison’s...” But Barack Obama is a celebrated speaker, and our hopes are unusually high. So where are you going to be when it all happens? The options are many, including:

1. Go to with the rest of the world.

For the nonelite, seeing the inauguration in Washington involves standing on the Mall, shivering and staring at a JumboTron in the company of many, many, many brand-new new acquaintances. Not everyone thinks this is the perfect way to experience history. Obama himself has been delicately hinting that we all might want to consider staying home, mentioning “long lines, a tough time getting around and most of all a lot of walking on what could be a very cold winter day.”

Still, if you go, then you can always say you did. “Actually having been there does give you some street cred, so to speak,” said Jeremy Brooke Straughn, a sociologist at , who has done research on generational memory. His own experiences go back to , whose inauguration he attended when he was 10. “All I can remember is it was extremely far away and I was very cold,” he said. This is not the kind of story that is going to leave them spellbound at your next dinner party.

But I totally sympathize. The first inauguration I went to was ’s in 1993 and the only thing I can remember is watching Barney the purple dinosaur vamp down Pennsylvania Avenue during the parade.
541 2009-01-17 Mr. Sigmund said that 80 percent of bird strikes do not cause significant damage to planes. “If it involves a small single bird, the pilot may not even realize that one has gone into the turbines of an engine,” Mr. Capainolo said.

Susan Elbin, director of conservation at the New York City Audubon Society, said millions of birds from more than 350 species pass through the New York region each year. She estimated the resident population of Canada geese in New York City and on Long Island to be more than 25,000, and said another 25,000 are believed to migrate through the area each year. There are uncounted thousands more resident geese in the entire region.

After a 1970s population decline in larger wild bird species because of environmental contamination, legislation requiring cleaner air and water resulted in “a remarkable resurgence in the population of larger bird species,” said Richard A. Dolbeer, a biologist and consultant who researched the problem for decades at the Department of Agriculture.

Canada geese, those scourges of the municipality, the golf course manager, the reservoir overseer and the lawn-maintenance provider, weigh about nine pounds and are most obviously appalling for their droppings of a pound or more a day — per bird.

Like many immigrant populations of New York and New Jersey, the geese have made the best of it, and are admired by biologists for their intelligence and resourcefulness. Hardly to blame for their resident status, many are believed to be descendants of Canada geese that were imported early in the 20th century for use as decoys by hunters, who clipped their wings.

Others came from farms in the 1950s in an effort to stock rural areas. Flocks of transitory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 between the United States, Canada, Mexico and many other countries. But the region’s three major airports are required by law to manage wildlife to ensure aircraft safety. Mr. Sigmund said the Port Authority met all federal, state and local regulations.

The Federal Aviation Administration, the Port Authority and the United States Department of Agriculture have tried to discourage birds from settling near airports, removing shrubs, trees and other vegetation that attracts nesting.

A five-year, $3 million program at Kennedy Airport uses falcons to disrupt the birds, Mr. Sigmund said.

At La Guardia Airport, birds’ nests have been raided (slathering the eggs with vegetable oil prevents them from hatching), and attempts have been made at several airports to startle them.

Conservation groups have often opposed the agency’s efforts, saying they endangered rare nesting colonies of gulls, and animal rights groups have criticized bird culls, but the Port Authority insists that they are sometimes necessary.

The agency’s consultants have trapped birds to euthanize them, and have blasted birds with shotguns. The population of Canada geese on Rikers Island has been especially persistent, despite nest destruction and an annual roundup since 2004. Mr. Sigmund said that about 500 geese were killed then, and the cull declined to 77 in 2008. Many of the geese are distributed to soup kitchens, Mr. Sigmund said.

From the birds’ perspective, “modern jet aircraft are a lot quieter than the old jet and piston-powered aircraft,” said Dr. Dolbeer, the consultant. “It’s not perceived as a threat until it’s too late.”

As for deterrents, pulsating lights and reflective coatings need more research, he said, in addition to the use of bird-detection radar at airports.

Nevertheless, the danger of bird strikes “is an ongoing problem, and it will always be a problem,” said Steven D. Garber, a biologist who was a consultant to the Port Authority in the 1990s.

And it may become more so — despite efforts at mitigation. “There is evidence both in North America and in Europe that birds are shifting their territories,” said Joel L. Cracraft, curator in charge of the department of ornithology at the American Museum of Natural History. “And that has been correlated with global warming.”
542 2009-01-17 The trial of an American college student, Amanda Knox, 21, left, and her onetime Italian boyfriend, Rafaelle Sollecito, 24, for the murder and sexual assault of Ms. Knox’s former housemate, Meredith Kercher, opened Friday in Perugia. Prosecutors contend that the pair, along with a third defendant who has already been convicted, killed Ms. Kercher in 2007 when a drug-fueled sex game went awry. Ms. Knox’s lawyer said he would prove the couple were elsewhere at the time. A lawyer for Mr. Sollecito, Giulia Bongiorno, argued that they were not a “bored couple” looking for excitement, but “two lovebirds in the first week of their romance,” Agence France-Presse reported. Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito have been imprisoned for more than a year in a case that has drawn intense media attention.
543 2009-01-17 Barclays, the British bank, said it expects next month to report pretax profit for the year “well ahead” of analysts’ estimates after its shares had plunged 25 percent. In a statement issued after the London stock market closed, the bank said it “knew of no justification” for the sudden fall in its share price. The stock closed at 98 pence, the lowest level since 1993. Barclays shares declined 45 percent this week. The bank will announce results for the year ended Dec. 31 on Feb. 17, it said. Dealers said there was no single reason for the fall, although some cited the return of short-selling after a temporary ban in Britain.
544 2009-01-17 Tiger Woods, who has resolutely avoided political statements since making history as the first black man to win the Masters in 1997, has found his political voice.

Woods, 33, announced Friday on his Web site that he would participate Sunday in the HBO presentation of “We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.”

Possibly the world’s most recognizable athlete, Woods will join a diverse cast of stars. The guest list includes Martin Luther King III, the son of the slain civil rights leader who delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. Other guests include the Hollywood celebrities Jack Black, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Queen Latifah, Steve Carell, Rosario Dawson and Laura Linney.

“I am honored that I was invited to this historic event and look forward to participating in Sunday’s festivities,” Woods said.

The event, which HBO has asked cable providers to make available free to all cable subscribers, will feature performances by musical artists whose eras and styles rarely coincide. They run the gamut from Beyoncé to Pete Seeger, the 89-year-old folk artist and civil-rights activist who was blacklisted during the 1950s.

Among those also expected to perform are U2, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Garth Brooks, Josh Groban, Herbie Hancock, Usher, Shakira, Will.I.Am, Sheryl Crow, James Taylor, Mary J. Blige, John Mellencamp, Jennifer Nettles, Heather Headley, Renée Fleming and John Legend.

Woods has been called upon to lend his voice to political, racial or cultural causes in the past, but has declined. In general, he has preferred to remain politically neutral, adhering to the observation made by his friend Michael Jordan that Republicans buy sneakers, too.
545 2009-01-17 WASHINGTON — A former F.B.I. director testified on Friday that Eric H. Holder Jr. was drawn into a “corrupt act” when Mr. Holder, who is President-elect Barack Obama’s nominee to be attorney general, became involved in the pardon of a fugitive businessman in 2001.

But the former director, Louis J. Freeh, who headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1993 to 2001, said Mr. Holder had learned from his “terrible mistakes” in the pardon of the financier, Marc Rich, by President Bill Clinton and deserved to be confirmed.

Mr. Freeh testified on the second and final day of Mr. Holder’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Holder completed his own testimony in an all-day session on Thursday and was not present on Friday when the committee heard testimony from a panel of supporters and opponents.

Among the witnesses were two who criticized Mr. Holder’s support for another pardon, for 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group known as the F.A.L.N., which has been on an F.B.I. list of domestic terrorist groups.

One witness, Joseph F. Conner, the son of a banker killed in a 1975 bombing of the Fraunces Tavern in New York by the group, said Mr. Holder had made an “egregious” recommendation. Mr. Holder said Thursday that the sentences of 16 to 20 years were justifiably reduced because none of those given clemency had been accused of a crime resulting in a death.

After the hearing on Friday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is the chairman of the judiciary panel, scheduled a committee vote on Mr. Holder’s nomination for Wednesday, the day after Inauguration Day. Mr. Holder faced tougher questioning than most of Mr. Obama’s cabinet selections, but he is expected to win confirmation despite the reservations expressed by several Republicans on the committee.
546 2009-01-17 Subsequently, Mr. Sorkin and Mr. Avellino managed to curtail the audit, even though a federal judge eventually concluded that Mr. Avellino had not been a credible witness in the case.

The S.E.C. also took at face value Mr. Avellino’s depiction of the deal he offered investors, which guaranteed returns of up to 20 percent a year while requiring him and Mr. Bienes to make up any shortfalls.

It is unclear whether commission investigators even discussed the case with Mr. Madoff. His name does not appear in the agency’s complaint, which referred only to an unnamed broker.

The government lawyers who handled the case are now in private practice. Richard Walker, then head of the S.E.C.’s New York office, is general counsel of Deutsche Bank. Kathryn Ashburgh, the lead lawyer on the case, works from her home in McLean, Va. And Keith W. Miller, a senior lawyer in the New York office, is a partner at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker. Through a spokesman, Mr. Walker declined to comment on the case. Mr. Miller and Ms. Ashburgh did not return calls.

Mr. Avellino did not respond to calls or visits to his homes in Nantucket, Mass.; Palm Beach, Fla.; and New York, or to messages left with his son Joseph Avellino in Chester, N.J. Gary Woodfield, the former federal prosecutor who represents Mr. Avellino, also declined to comment. Francis B. Brogan, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Avellino and a partner at Greenberg Traurig in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., asked that questions be e-mailed to him, then did not respond.

Mark Raymond, a lawyer for Mr. Bienes, said that his client had no knowledge of Mr. Madoff’s fraud and had lost tens of millions of dollars, most of his savings, in the fraud. Mr. Bienes worked mainly as a fund-raiser, while Mr. Avellino actively managed Avellino & Bienes, according to court documents and people who knew the men.

Mr. Avellino has been connected to Mr. Madoff for his entire career. After graduating from the City University of New York in 1958, Mr. Avellino began working as an accountant at a firm run by Saul Alpern, Mr. Madoff’s father-in-law.

Mr. Madoff also briefly ran his securities business from the firm’s offices. As early as 1962, according to the S.E.C.’s complaint against him, Mr. Avellino began raising money for Mr. Madoff, who was running a small brokerage company. Mr. Bienes joined in 1965.

In 1977, Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes formed an accounting firm in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Avellino owned half the company; the remainder was owned by Mr. Bienes and his wife, Dianne. In 1980, the Bieneses moved to Fort Lauderdale, while Mr. Avellino remained in New York.

The two men gradually shifted their focus from accounting to raising money for Mr. Madoff. Their business expanded until 1992, when the S.E.C. received marketing materials showing that Avellino & Bienes had promised investors annual returns of up to 20 percent. Commission officials said at the time that they believed they had stumbled upon a Ponzi scheme.

But when the investigators went to Mr. Avellino, they found, to their surprise, an apparently legitimate explanation. The money, $441 million from 3,200 clients, was being managed by Mr. Madoff, whose brokerage firm by then was one of the biggest stock traders on Wall Street. In a deposition, Mr. Avellino explained that he had promised returns of 13.5 to 20 percent a year. If Mr. Madoff fell short of producing those returns with his stock trades, Avellino & Bienes would make up the difference, Mr. Avellino said.

“If I was short and there was a shortfall, I would be in trouble,” Mr. Avellino said in a deposition.

No one at the securities commission seems to have questioned why Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes offered clients a double-digit guaranteed return on money that they did not even control. Nor do the records offer any hint that the commission considered whether Mr. Madoff, rather than Avellino & Bienes, might be operating a Ponzi scheme.

Instead, once the commission was satisfied that the money existed in Mr. Madoff’s accounts and would be returned, it quickly reached a deal with Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes. Through Mr. Sorkin, the lawyer who once oversaw the regulator’s New York office, the men agreed to return the money to investors, shut down their firm, undergo an audit and pay a fine of $350,000.

So went the public version of the case presented by the agency. “There’s nothing to indicate fraud,” Martin Kuperberg, an administrator at the commission, told The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 1, 1992.

But court records reveal a much messier investigation. On Nov. 17, 1992, as part of the deal, a federal judge ordered Price Waterhouse to audit the financial statements of Avellino & Bienes.

The accountants soon learned that Avellino & Bienes did not keep conventional books, only the basic ledgers necessary to prepare tax records. Price Waterhouse then asked Mr. Avellino to put together records for 1992. He declined.

“My experience has taught me to not commit any figures to scrutiny when, as in this case, it can be construed as ‘bible’ and subject to criticism,” Mr. Avellino wrote somewhat ungrammatically. “In this present instance, quite severely. I explained how the profit and loss can be computed from the records you now hold in your possession that Bernard L. Madoff and I supplied.”

Even after learning of the missing records, the commission did not reopen its investigation.

The case then took an unusual turn. Mr. Avellino and Mr. Sorkin complained about Price Waterhouse’s fees and demanded that federal Judge John E. Sprizzo, who was overseeing the case, quickly end the audit.

“I am not a cash cow, and I will not be milked,” Mr. Avellino wrote in an affidavit.

By the end of January 1993, both the securities investigation and the Price Waterhouse audit were effectively over. But in a hearing over the disputed fees in April, Judge Sprizzo sharply criticized Mr. Sorkin, who acknowledged that Avellino & Bienes had agreed to the audit in part to avoid a deeper investigation.

“If you didn’t consent to the audit, the commission could have pursued other remedies. They would have asked for a hearing, they would have asked for discovery,” Judge Sprizzo said.

Judge Sprizzo said he did not believe Mr. Avellino’s testimony. Mr. Avellino “was worried about self-incrimination,” the judge said. He ordered Avellino & Bienes to pay Price Waterhouse its bill of $428,679 in full.

In an interview, Mr. Sorkin said this week that he could not recall whether Mr. Madoff referred Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes to him. He has known Mr. Madoff since at least the early 1980s, he said, but did not represent Mr. Madoff at the time of the Avellino case.

After the settlement, Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes disbanded their firm. The Bieneses, who own a $7 million house in Fort Lauderdale, became philanthropists, contributing millions of dollars to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale and the Broward County Library. Mr. Avellino and his wife, Nancy, split their time between Nantucket, Manhattan and south Florida. In 2003, the Avellinos bought a $4.5 million house in Palm Beach less than five blocks from Mr. Madoff’s house there. Their Manhattan apartment is similarly close to Mr. Madoff’s apartment.

Through Mr. Brogan, his lawyer, Mr. Avellino set up a web of foundations and partnerships, including the Kenn Jordan Foundation. The foundation had $6 million in assets, at least some of which were invested with Mr. Madoff, and was nominally controlled by a man named Kenneth Jordan, who lived in a small Fort Lauderdale apartment.

Lola Kurland, who retired as the office manager for Avellino & Bienes, said in an interview that Mr. Jordan was a “personal friend” of Mr. Avellino. After Mr. Jordan died in 1999, the Kenn Jordan Foundation transferred its assets to Mr. Avellino’s family foundation and was dissolved. But Mr. Avellino continued to use Mr. Jordan’s name to raise money from investors, according to a lawsuit filed against him in state court in Nantucket last month.

His former housekeeper, Nevena Ivanova, alleges in that suit that Mr. Avellino raised $200,000 from her and her husband in September 2006 — and he directed her to make out her check to Kenn Jordan Associates, “a fictitious entity.” In July 2008, Ms. Ivanova asked Mr. Avellino to return her investment, which at the time stood at $124,000. He put her off for months, according to the lawsuit. Then, on Dec. 1, 10 days before Mr. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme became public, Mr. Avellino told Ms. Ivanova that her money had been lost.
547 2009-01-17 Investigators said they were confident that another vital source of information, the plane’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder — known as the black boxes — were still in the tail section of the plane. Diving conditions were so difficult that investigators decided that it was safer to wait until the plane was out of the water before trying to remove them, said Kathryn O. Higgins, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board assigned to the scene. In many water crashes, investigators spend the first few days searching for the boxes.

Investigators were also searching for video of the jet during its final glide into the water, and they have begun reviewing Coast Guard surveillance video from along the Hudson that investigators say shows the plane near the time of the crash. Coast Guard officers were monitoring the video at the time.

The first 911 call to the police came from a man in the Bronx who reported that he heard a loud boom in the sky, looked up and saw the plane, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. “He said the plane was on fire,” Mr. Browne said.

Investigators from the safety board have organized into teams that include specialists from US Airways, Airbus, the engine manufacturer and unions representing the pilots, flight attendants and controllers, as well as Department of Agriculture specialists, who will help analyze any bird information.

Ms. Higgins expressed confidence that searchers would find the two engines because the area to be scouted is only a few square miles.

Once found, the engines will be taken to “a secure, undisclosed location,” she said, in a moment of levity in discussing a crash that produced surprisingly few injuries. The engines will be taken apart by the manufacturer, CFM international, under the supervision of board technicians, she said.

Engines mounted under wings, as they are on the A320, often detach in crashes.

While the crew is reported to have told air traffic controllers that they had hit birds, the safety board had not yet confirmed the report. The plane was at about 3,200 feet at the time. Ms. Higgins said, “This is the first accident that we’ve investigated in a very long time where this has been a factor.”

At about the time of the crash, a government weather radar in Upton, on Long Island, registered something in the path of Flight 1549 that a government scientist, Steve Ansari of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, said was consistent with a big flock of birds. Mr. Ansari said it might also have been precipitation.

But a specialist in the use of radar to study birds, Jeffrey J. Buler of the University of Delaware, said that the image was more likely “biological than meteorological,” because the amount of radar energy reflected back to the station was smaller than what rain or snow would produce. The radar indicated that the objects were moving toward Upton at about 20 knots, a speed consistent with geese, he said. He also noted that at this time of year, large flocks move between feeding grounds and roosting areas.

As the investigation proceeded, the Coast Guard was concerned that fuel still in the plane’s tanks would flow into the river. Capt. Bob O’Brien, the commander of the Coast Guard sector for New York, said that the plane still had about 4,000 gallons of jet fuel but that it had not started leaking.

The investigators ordinarily debrief both the cockpit crew and the cabin crew, but whatever the information from human sources, they rely most heavily on data, in the form of the cockpit voice recorder, which catches both conversations and mechanical sounds, and the flight data recorder.

This plane, delivered to the airline in 1999, was equipped with an advanced data recorder that is supposed to record information on power levels in each engine, fuel flow, altitude, air speed, angle, position of flight controls like the ailerons and rudder, and other information.

In their laboratory near Washington, the safety board technicians will synchronize the readings from the voice recorder, the air-to-ground communications and the digital flight recorder to get a better picture of what happened. They will also check F.A.A. radar tapes for signs of birds.

Airline pilots say that birds in the flight path are not uncommon, but that the problem happens far more often at Kennedy Airport than at La Guardia. One veteran controller at New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, the radar installation handling the US Airways flight, said he did not believe that there were any reports of birds on Thursday, except from the crew of the plane that went down.

The chief investigator in the crash is Robert Benzon, a safety board veteran who was also in charge of the inquiry into the crash of American Airlines 587, an A300 that went down shortly after takeoff from Kennedy in November 2001. That crash killed all 260 on board and 5 people on the ground.
548 2009-01-17 BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union said Friday that Microsoft’s practice of selling the Internet Explorer browser together with its Windows operating system violated the union’s antitrust rules.

It ordered the software giant to untie the browser from its operating system in the 27-nation union, enabling makers of rival browsers to compete fairly.

“Microsoft’s tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between Web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice,” the E.U. said in a statement.

It gave Microsoft eight weeks to respond, adding that the company could defend its position in a hearing if it found that useful.

Microsoft issued a statement saying, “We are committed to conducting our business in full compliance with European law.”

The commission’s investigation into Microsoft’s Web-surfing software began a year ago, after the Norwegian browser-maker Opera Software filed a complaint. Opera argued that Microsoft hurt competitors not only by bundling the software, in effect giving away the browser, but also by not following accepted Web standards.
549 2009-01-17 WASHINGTON  Mark Delepine, 35, an electrician from North Miami, briefly considered making the trip with his wife to Barack Obama’s inauguration. “She loves politics,” he said. “She would sleep in the car just to go.”

But they began to hear about some of the annoyances that might await them in the capital: crushing crowds, frigid temperatures and jacked-up prices.

“Too much hassle,” Mr. Delepine said, vigorously shaking his head. “That city is going to be packed.”

No one knows how many people have been discouraged from joining inaugural events starting this weekend. But with officials making dire warnings about bridge and Metro station closings, limited hotel space and other logistical nightmares  while also promoting a tantalizing array of events and entertainers  an increasingly chaotic push-me, pull-you atmosphere is engulfing the capital days before what is likely to be the biggest gathering in its history.

On the one hand, inaugural planners have painted situations of a city under siege, with subways packed at “crush levels,” old people having to walk long distances in foul weather, and parents carrying babies for hours without finding a place to change diapers. And so many people will try to use their cellphones at once that they may not work, even though the wireless companies are trucking in extra equipment.

Planners say they are not trying to discourage people from coming, but just painting a realistic picture of what they will face.

At the same time, planners boast that this inauguration will be the most open and accessible in history and have lined up a cavalcade of superstars to perform, starting with a concert at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday with Beyoncé, Bono, Bruce Springsteen and Shakira. The concert will be on television (for people who have cable or satellite), but if the Boss can brave the cold, the theory goes, maybe you can, too.

The mixed message has only heightened an already uncertain situation. The latest estimate is that 1.5 million to 3 million people are coming, prompting the federal government to declare the inauguration a national emergency. Early forecasts call for clouds and temperatures in the mid- to low-30s, with a 30 percent chance of snow.

Even Mr. Obama has become one of those trying to tamp down the crowds. This week, he warned that Washington would be jammed next week and suggested, ever so gently, the same message that some of his planners have been sending more bluntly: Stay home.

“Unprecedented numbers” of visitors, the president-elect said in a statement, “will mean long lines, a tough time getting around, and most of all, a lot of walking on what could be a very cold winter day.”

“Fortunately, you don’t have to brave the crowds and commotion in order to participate,” he added, noting that people could watch many events on television. On Friday, inaugural planners put out an online tool kit to allow people at home to participate interactively with events here and also to encourage them to stage their own inaugural celebrations in their hometowns.

There are some indications that crowds might be smaller than imagined, and even local officials have scaled their estimates back from an early wild guess of four million.

One indicator is that the number of charter buses scheduled to come appears to be down. At one point, officials had expected 10,000 charters, but fewer than half that have registered for permits. Horton’s Transit Service in Durham, N.C., for example, was planning to send two buses but canceled one because passengers backed out after hearing crowd reports and worries about the cold.

Another sign that the crush may have been over-imagined is that a surge of online advertisements by local residents trying to rent their homes to out-of-towners appears to have gone largely unmet. It is not clear if the residents were asking too much money, if their homes were somehow inadequate or if potential renters found other accommodations  or just decided to bag it.

With so much uncertainty and potential for chaos, people are taking Mr. Obama’s advice and planning to celebrate the inauguration away from the capital.

“I thought about going to D.C.,” said Wayne Berry, 42, who lives in Cleveland and works at a bank. “Both my sisters are going, and we have family there, so I could have gone. But I don’t like big crowds, and I hate cold weather.”

Grass-roots progressives from Keystone Progress and MoveOn.org have organized more than 3,000 Inaugural Bashes around the country, including what they say are potlucks in people’s homes, get-togethers in bars, and even some full-fledged inaugural balls.

Several schools in the region, and some as far away as Philadelphia, are closing for the day. Others are using it as a teachable moment. In fact, the inaugural planners have sent out teaching lessons to public schools.

In Miami, 2,000 people are preparing to attend a celebration at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, where they can watch a free simulcast of the events in Washington, with entertainment by a Miami high school choir and marching band.

Columbia University in New York, one of Mr. Obama’s alma maters, is hosting an outdoor party (“in all but extreme weather”) for students and alumni to watch events on a Jumbotron. MSNBC is projecting its coverage into theaters in 21 cities.

Even communities, churches, restaurants and businesses close to the proceedings are hosting viewing parties so their members and customers do not have to go downtown.

Some people are not attending, but not by choice.

Aurora Buckley, 31, a waitress in Las Vegas, was so thrilled with Mr. Obama’s election that she and her partner immediately planned a trip to the inauguration. But then they broke up, and Ms. Buckley lost one of her two waitressing jobs. Now, she cannot afford the trip. Instead, she is having a party at her home with a dozen friends who have also lost their jobs.

“We don’t really have much money; I’m the only one who even has cable anymore,” Ms. Buckley said. “But everyone will bring a dish, and at least we’ll be together to witness this.”
550 2009-01-17 In the wake of college football’s Bowl Championship Series and the opening stages of college basketball’s conference season, which command hundreds of hours of television coverage, a Washington-based watchdog group has stoked the debate on the N.C.A.A.’s responsibility to control beer advertising during college sports broadcasts.

In a study published Friday, the Center for Science in the Public Interest said that the N.C.A.A. had not lived up to the claim of its president, Myles Brand, that it had “the most conservative and restrictive approach to advertising of any sports organization.”

Examining the ads broadcast during the three games of the 2008 N.C.A.A. Final Four and several 2008-9 B.C.S. games, the center found that 12 percent of the Final Four ads were for beer, compared with 6 percent of the B.C.S. ads.

But the N.C.A.A. was quick to dispute the accuracy of those figures.

“Once again, C.S.P.I. has misrepresented facts associated with alcohol advertising during the Men’s Final Four,” the N.C.A.A. spokesman Bob Williams said Friday in an e-mail message.

The N.C.A.A. allows 60 seconds of advertising for beer ads for each hour of the N.C.A.A. broadcast. According to Williams, the six minutes of beer advertising that ran during last year’s Final Four were acceptable because the three game broadcasts totaled seven hours.
551 2009-01-17 SAN FRANCISCO — Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, met in New York earlier this week with Roy J. Bostock, Yahoo’s chairman, according to a person briefed on the meeting.

It was the second high-level contact between Microsoft and Yahoo to come to light this week, and suggests that negotiations over a Web search deal between the two companies could be restarting. On Wednesday, Carol Bartz, Yahoo’s new chief executive, told employees she had had an informal conversation with Mr. Ballmer since she was selected by the board to lead Yahoo.

Details of the conversations could not be learned, and spokesmen for Yahoo and Microsoft declined to comment.

In recent weeks, Mr. Ballmer has said repeatedly that Microsoft remains interested in doing a deal with Yahoo involving its Web search and advertising business, and that he favored coming to an agreement sooner rather than later.

The appointment of Ms. Bartz on Tuesday renewed speculation that Yahoo might be more willing to consider a deal to hand over its search business to Microsoft. Last year, after merger talks between the two companies collapsed, Microsoft and Yahoo discussed various ways to combine their search assets, including an outsourcing agreement or an outright sale of Yahoo’s search business to Microsoft, but the negotiations did not bear fruit.
552 2009-01-17 Four people were thrown overboard with their hands and feet tied, in order to encourage the others to board the barge, according to the reports.

After drifting for two weeks, about 100 of them were rescued on the Andaman Islands, which are administered by India. About 300 remain missing after trying to swim to shore, according to several reports from the news media and human rights groups.

In a second case soon afterward, 580 people were reportedly seized off the Thai coast on three overcrowded fishing boats. These were towed back out to sea after their engines were removed, said Chris Lewa, an expert on Rohingya issues who heads a private human rights group called the Arakan Project.

Two of those boats reached shore — at Aceh in Indonesia and on the Andaman Islands — and one is missing, she said.

She said a new boatload of 46 migrants arrived Friday on Patong Island, off Thailand’s southern coast, and were seized by the Thai military, which has not until recently been involved in local illegal immigration issues.

The expulsions were reported this week in the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. Thai officials denied Friday that any such expulsions had occurred.

“We never push them back to the sea,” said Lt. Col. Tara Soranarak, inspector in the Ranong immigration office. “We have our procedure to deport back the migrants to their home country after processing them through the Thai legal system.”

Privately, Thai officials voiced concern about the Rohingya as Muslims who might join a rebellion in southern Thailand in which some people are seeking a separate Islamic state. This week Amnesty International issued a report condemning Thailand as “systematically engaging in torture” against the insurgency.

The reports of harsh treatment come in the context of a huge flow of refugees from neighboring countries that has imposed a social and economic burden on Thailand. Since the mid-1970s, Thailand has been a refuge for millions fleeing conflict and repression in Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.

“Thailand is surrounded by dangerous neighbors who have generated huge refugee flows, and it has sometimes felt overwhelmed by these flows,” said Kenneth Bacon, president of the human rights group Refugees International. “Its record in handling them is mixed.”

In the most notorious episode, in 1979, 42,000 Cambodians fleeing the murderous Khmer Rouge were forced into a minefield by the Thai military. Survivors said many of them died.

During the same period, Vietnamese boat people were victimized by Thai pirates operating without official restraint.

Although tens of thousands of refugees now live in semipermanent camps along the Thai border with Myanmar, some of them are periodically forced back. Last summer Human Rights Watch protested the forcible repatriation of a group of ethnic Karen refugees who had fled military brutality in Myanmar.

The Rohingya are among the most helpless of the refugees, an abused minority in Myanmar who migrated in large numbers to Bangladesh, where they live in poverty and mostly without rights as a stateless minority.

Experts on the Rohingya describe an endless cycle of abuse in which migrants are handed to traffickers who demand money to take them to Malaysia, where many are arrested and sent back into the hands of some of the same traffickers in Thailand.

If at any stage they are unable to pay the traffickers, the immigrants say, they can be sold to Thai fishing trawlers as indentured laborers.
553 2009-01-17 DETROIT — The Treasury Department said Friday that it would lend $1.5 billion to Chrysler’s finance unit to finance loans for consumers who want to buy vehicles from the struggling automaker.

The loan package to Chrysler Financial is the latest aid from Washington to Chrysler and General Motors to help stabilize their faltering businesses.

The $1.5-billion, five-year loan will come from money already in the Troubled Asset Relief Program created last year to provide emergency aid to financial institutions.

Government officials said that the $1.5 billion loan would be parceled out to Chrysler Financial, beginning with a $100 million installment on Friday.

The government loan is going to a new corporate entity created by Chrysler Financial, which is owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus also owns an 80 percent stake in Chrysler’s automotive operations.
554 2009-01-17 “You just wonder about the viability of some of these companies,” said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “There’s a lot of fear out there that this thing could be worse and bigger than we considered.”

Despite the positive turn, losses persisted in the financial sector. Citigroup, which is splitting itself in two, fell 9 percent, to $3.50 a share, and shares of Bank of America fell by 14 percent, to $7.18. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley also closed lower.

The Treasury Department has already devoted more than $250 billion in federal bailout funds to shore up large and small banks across the country. Bank of America was previously granted $25 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and $50 billion is expected to go to Citigroup.

On Friday, Bank of America reported a loss of $1.79 billion in the fourth quarter, and Citigroup said it had lost $8.29 billion and was splitting itself in two. The announcements raised more concerns about their viability as the economy dwindles in a painful recession.

“The big concern now is the initial bailouts weren’t enough, and the banks are now coming back for more,” Mr. Sparks said. “You have to ask yourself, ‘If that didn’t fix the problem, will this?’ ”

At first, investors brushed off the huge losses and took heart in the news that the federal government was throwing another lifeline to Bank of America, doubling down on its pledge to do everything possible to rescue financial institutions.

“If you can find a single person out there who’s surprised even by the magnitude of those losses, I would be surprised,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex Investments.

With Friday’s gains, the Dow finished the week 3.7 percent lower while the S.& P. was down 4.5 percent. The Nasdaq was down less for the week, falling 2.8 percent.

All week, uncertainty on Wall Street grew as investors endured another barrage of economic news that foreshadowed more months of economic pain. The government reported this week that consumer prices grew at the slowest pace in 50 years in 2008, retail sales spiraled downward and trade levels slumped as demand for foreign goods virtually dried up.

“Consumer spending is plunging, businesses are cutting back on their investment plans, and the export cushion which had been supporting manufacturers has disappeared,” Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note about sliding industrial production.

Longer-term Treasury prices fell on Friday, pushing yields on the benchmark 10-year note to their highest point of the week, as investors anticipated a flood of new government debt. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 1 2/32, to 112 16/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.32 percent, up from 2.21 percent late Thursday.

Crude oil for February delivery settled $1.11 higher, at $36.51, in New York trading on Friday.
555 2009-01-17 Consumer prices advanced at their slowest pace in 50 years in 2008, raising concerns about deflation as the weakening economy suppressed demand for cars, clothing, electronics and a host of goods and services, the government reported on Friday.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in December, its third consecutive monthly decline, after sliding 1.7 percent in November. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, was unchanged.

For all of 2008, consumer prices grew just 0.1 percent while the core rate rose 1.8 percent, the Labor Department reported.

Friday’s numbers raised more worries about deflation, a destructive loop in which falling prices slow economic growth, leading to lower wages, lost jobs and more stagnation.

Prices that both consumers and businesses pay have been ebbing as the price of oil plummeted from its peak in July and the widening recession sapped global demand for goods and services, curbing the price of everything from automobiles to X-ray equipment.

Most of December’s declines in consumer prices came from lower energy prices, which fell 8.3 percent from November. Prices at the gas pump fell 17.2 percent for the month and were down 43 percent for the year, just six months after Americans were paying record prices of $4.11 for a gallon of gas.
556 2009-01-17 HONG KONG — The United States has frozen the assets of two Burmese businessmen and their companies for aiding the military junta in Myanmar, as Human Rights Watch assailed the regime’s “already dismal human rights record” in its annual report.

In one of the final actions on human rights by the departing Bush administration, the Treasury Department punished Win Aung and Zaw Zaw, for supporting the junta. Mr. Win Aung, 55, a construction tycoon, has backed the military government financially. Mr. Zaw Zaw, 42, has extensive holdings in timber, gems, resort properties and hotels through his Max Myanmar Group.

“Congress and the administration have made clear the need to apply vigorous sanctions against the Burmese junta as long as it continues to suppress democratic dissent,” said Adam J. Szubin, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. He said the imprisonment of leading pro-democracy activists marked Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, as “one of the world’s worst violators of human rights.”

Existing sanctions also were broadened Thursday against several other entities. Among these were the financial network of Tay Za, described by the United States agency as “a notorious regime henchman and arms dealer;” 10 Singaporean firms owned or controlled by Cecilia Ng and her husband, Steven Law; and Myanmar Ivanhoe Copper, owner of the country’s largest copper mine.

The sanctions, which freeze assets under United States jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from doing business with the companies, were made under two executive orders and an act of Congress in 2008. Canada, Australia, the European Union and Switzerland have also instituted sanctions against Myanmar.

563 2009-01-18 The four-time Pro Bowl defensive end Julius Peppers has decided he will not sign a long-term deal with the Carolina Panthers when he becomes an unrestricted free agent on Feb. 26. Peppers, the Panthers’ first-round pick in 2002, believes Carolina’s defensive system is not for him, even after recording a career-high 14 ½ sacks this season.

His agent, Carl Carey, said Peppers wants to play in a 3-4 defense. The Panthers use a 4-3 alignment. The Panthers must decide if they will place the franchise tag on Peppers, which would virtually force him to stay with the Panthers. If they do, another team could sign Peppers only by giving Carolina two first-round draft picks in return. But doing that would mean the Panthers would have to give Peppers a one-year deal worth $16.7 million. And Peppers could also decide to hold out.
564 2009-01-18 Zach Johnson played bogey-free for a 66 at the Sony Open in Honolulu, finishing atop a leader board so crowded that a dozen players were separated by three shots. Tadd Fujikawa, an 18-year-old who turned professional after his sophomore year in high school, delivered the best round of his life in the third round, making birdies on half of his holes for an 8-under 62 that left him two shots out of the lead.
565 2009-01-18 WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials on Saturday urged consumers to avoid eating cookies, cakes, ice cream and other foods that contain peanut butter until the authorities can learn more about a deadly outbreak of salmonella contamination.

Most peanut butter sold in jars at supermarkets appears to be safe, said Stephen Sundlof, head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food safety center.

Officials are focusing on peanut paste, as well as peanut butter, produced at a plant in Blakely, Ga., owned by the Peanut Corporation of America. Its peanut butter is distributed to institutions and food companies but not sold directly to consumers. The peanut paste is an ingredient in cookies, cakes and other products sold in supermarkets.

“This is an excellent illustration of an ingredient-driven outbreak,” said Dr. Robert Tauxe, who oversees food-borne illness investigations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

More than 470 people in 43 states have been sickened in the salmonella outbreak, and at least 90 have been hospitalized. At least six deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The salmonella bacteria, which can cause diarrhea, cramping and fever, is the most common source of food poisoning in the United States.

Officials said new illnesses were still being reported in the outbreak.

The Kellogg Company, which listed the Peanut Corporation as one of its suppliers, has recalled 16 products. They include the Austin and Keebler brands of peanut butter sandwich crackers and some snack-size packs of Famous Amos peanut butter cookies and Keebler Soft Batch Homestyle peanut butter cookies. Consumers should throw those products away.
566 2009-01-18 The stock market marked the New Year with one of its best performances ever. Then it put on one of its worst performances ever.

Investors might be tempted to scream, "Make up your mind."

For some Wall Streeters, the behavior of the market at each year's start holds meaning as an indicator of things to come. But is it a reliable gauge?

Yale Hirsch, a longtime analyst, reported years ago that "as goes January, so goes the year." That is true most of the time since the Depression ended, but it was was not accurate very often before 1940.

So is this year, following one of the worst years for the stock market, going to be one of recovery as the recession ends? That seemed to be the expectation as 2008 turned to 2009.

Over the last two trading days of 2008 and the first one of this year, the Standard & Poor's 500 leaped 7.2 percent, making it the best turn-of-year period since 1930 yielded to 1931.
567 2009-01-18 Lawmakers leading the campaign for such safeguards include Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Pete Stark of California, both Democrats; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.

Without strong safeguards, Mr. Markey said, the dream of electronic health information networks could turn into “a nightmare for consumers.”

In the last few years, personal health information on hundreds of thousands of people has been compromised because of security lapses at hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. These breaches occurred despite federal privacy rules issued under a 1996 law. Congress is trying to strengthen those privacy protections and make sure they apply to computer records. Lobbyists for insurers, drug benefit managers and others in the health industry are mobilizing a campaign to persuade Congress that overly stringent privacy protections would frustrate the potential benefits of digital records.

One of the proposed safeguards would outlaw the sale of any personal health information in an electronic medical record, except with the patient’s permission.

Another would allow patients to impose additional controls on certain particularly sensitive information, like records of psychotherapy, abortions and tests for the virus that causes AIDS. Patients could demand that such information be segregated from the rest of their medical records.

Under other proposals being seriously considered in Congress, health care providers and insurers would have to use encryption technology to protect personal health information stored in or sent by computers. Patients would have a right to an accounting of any disclosures of their electronic data. Health care providers and insurers would have to notify patients whenever such information was lost, stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose. And patients — or state officials acting on their behalf — could recover damages from an entity that improperly used or disclosed personal health information.

Rahm Emanuel, who will be the White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, advocated such safeguards when he was a House member from Illinois. “As we move forward on health information technology,” Mr. Emanuel said, “it is absolutely essential that an individual’s most personal and vulnerable information is protected.”

Advisers to Mr. Obama say he favors strong privacy protections but does not want the dispute to slow down the bill.

Mary R. Grealy, president of the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents large health care corporations, said the proposed safeguards could be an impediment to the widespread adoption of health information technology and counteract any economic stimulus effect.

In a letter to Congressional leaders, Karen M. Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, expressed “serious concern about privacy provisions being considered for inclusion in the economic stimulus bill.”

She criticized, in particular, a proposal that would require health care providers to obtain the consent of patients before disclosing personal health information for treatment, payment or “health care operations.”

Such a requirement, she said, could cripple efforts to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, which often require coordination of care among many specialists.

At the moment, senior House Democrats are determined to include privacy safeguards in the economic recovery bill. But some insurance lobbyists said they hoped Congress would punt on the issue, leaving privacy standards to be developed by the Health and Human Services Department, where they believe they can make their case more effectively. Microsoft has joined many consumer groups in supporting stronger safeguards. The software giant has developed products that allow consumers and providers to store and share medical data in a secure format.

“Health information technology will succeed only if privacy is protected,” said Frank C. Torres, director of consumer affairs at Microsoft. “For the president-elect to achieve his vision, he has to protect privacy.”

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Peter R. Orszag, director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said electronic medical records could be more secure than paper records.

“If the files are electronic,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “computers can record every time someone has access to your medical information.” But, he said, the challenge is political as well as technical.

“Until people are more confident about the security of electronic medical records,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “it’s vitally important that we err on the side of privacy.”

The data in medical records has great potential commercial value. Several companies, for example, buy and sell huge amounts of data on the prescribing habits of doctors, and the information has proved invaluable to pharmaceutical sales representatives.

“Health I.T. without privacy is an excellent way for companies to establish a gold mine of information that can be used to increase profits, promote expensive drugs, cherry-pick patients who are cheaper to insure and market directly to consumers,” said Dr. Deborah C. Peel, coordinator of the Coalition for Patient Privacy, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union among its members.
568 2009-01-18 The room at the end of the hall was Terance’s, her youngest. On one of its walls is a studio portrait of him as a baby, alongside a collection of images of him throughout his life. It was made into a collage after he killed himself on May 3, 2008, weeks before his 20th birthday.

“The mistakes I made in my life I’m not proud of, but I look at his picture and I know I did the best that I could,” she said.

Ms. McBroom, a native of Brooklyn, described her mother as being mentally ill. Her father, she said, wrestled with drug addiction. As a child, she was bounced between relatives and eventually landed in a group home.

At 15, she had her first child, Kelly. Two years later, not long after the birth of her second, Anthony, she suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized for being suicidal. Over the years she was in and out of hospitals, sometimes on drugs and homeless. Kelly, Anthony and her third child, Keith, were all placed in foster care.

In 2005, Ms. McBroom moved to her current apartment. It was then that Terance, who had always been shy and quiet, began to show signs of mental illness. She had an especially close bond with Terance. Ms. McBroom urged him to join her at the clubhouse, which she was attending weekly and where she found help for her mental illness.

On the weekend before Mother’s Day, Ms. McBroom said Terance took her shopping and filled the freezer with food. She recalled cooking fried shrimp and French fries, his favorite meal.

She awoke to the sound of sirens. While she was sleeping, Terance had jumped from the eight-story housing project building. When she came outside, his body was still on the sidewalk.

“I don’t know how in the world he did that,” said Ms. McBroom, looking away. “I loved that boy; he was my baby.”

Ms. McBroom received support from the members and staff of the clubhouse and from the Bethlehem Baptist Church, where she sings in the choir. “I thought I was going to end up in the hospital after Terance died,” Ms. McBroom said. “I kept saying, ‘I got to get through this, I got to get through this.’ ”

In late July, Ms. McBroom began her current position. As part of the support for the job program, participants are given a small amount of money for emergency carfare, in case they are running late. She also was given money toward a uniform at her previous job at McDonald’s: $70 in all from the Neediest Cases Fund.

The Virgin Megastore in Times Square is scheduled to close in April, but as part of the program, she is eligible to apply for another job after her current one ends. Ms. McBroom said, “You know, people say ‘You’re the best greeter here.’ And I can’t believe that, but that’s what they say.”

569 2009-01-18 A well-known comedian known as Zarganar was sentenced to 59 years in prison after criticizing the government for neglecting the victims of the cyclone that swept through lower Myanmar in May, killing more than 130,000 people.

U Gambira, a monk who helped lead the 2007 protests, was sentenced to 68 years.

Other political prisoners are listed in the database as farmers, a blogger, an ice cream seller, a bus conductor and a hip-hop singer in a band called Acid. All angered the government in one way or another.

In United Nations reports and diplomatic cables, Burmese political prisoners are often just a statistic, a measurement of the many human rights abuses carried out by Myanmar’s ruling generals.

But to members of the association here, the prisoners are part of a fraternity of fellow dissidents who have many needs. The association helps family members smuggle medicine, reading materials, blankets, clothing and food to the prisoners.

Occasionally guards are sympathetic, Mr. Bo Kyi said. Often they help just because they are poor and need the small bribes that prisoners and family members pay them.

Even the most basic necessities can require payment. “If you want to get more water for a shower you have to pay money,” Mr. Bo Kyi said.

Some prisons are so crowded that prisoners can sleep only on their sides. But guards reserve “V.I.P.” corners where prisoners can lie flat on their backs — for a fee.

The association’s annual budget of $200,000 is financed by the United States government’s National Endowment for Democracy, the Dutch government and private donors.

The budget also helps pay to whisk out of the country dissidents in danger of arrest.

Two years ago the association sent $100 to U Aung Kyaw Oo, a former student activist who spent 14 years in prison, to help him escape Myanmar. He made it to Thailand, and he said he would remain here. “It feels better than inside,” he said. “They can’t arrest me here.”

Myanmar’s most famous political prisoner, the Nobel laureate and pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is barred by the military government from leaving her lakeside house in a plush neighborhood of Yangon, the commercial capital, formerly known as Rangoon. Her cause is championed by a wide variety of people across the globe, including foreign leaders and college students in the United States.

But most political prisoners in Myanmar live much more anonymously and in much more rudimentary conditions.

To be a political prisoner in Myanmar, Mr. Bo Kyi said, is to truly experience darkness. Prisoners are often let out of their cells only 20 minutes a day, he said. They are lorded over by the criminal prisoners, who are encouraged by the guards to discipline and intimidate them. And they are routinely transferred hundreds of miles from their families to remote prisons that have no clinics or medical staff.

As punishment, guards sometimes make prisoners crawl through an interrogation room where the floor is made of bricks with sharp edges. During interrogation they require male inmates to answer them using words in the Burmese language that are usually reserved for women.

Mr. Bo Kyi and his colleagues say they want to cast light on the plights of the lesser-known prisoners. His group’s logo shows a beam of light shining into a prison cell.

As a former political prisoner himself, Mr. Bo Kyi is fluent in the notion of deprivation and cruelty: the crowded cells, the inadequate food and the stinking bucket that inmates shared as a toilet.

But 10 years after his release he says he now also sees more clearly the pain that lingers outside prison walls, among the extended families who are ostracized and harassed by Myanmar’s authorities. In October, he heard about the wife of an imprisoned dissident who, desperate for cash, cut her long hair, a treasured symbol of beauty in Myanmar, and sold it for the equivalent of $20.

“When I got that information I felt very sad,” Mr. Bo Kyi said in English, which he learned from a fellow inmate who had memorized the Burmese-English dictionary to pass the time. The association sent the woman cash to help her start a small grocery store.

The association tracks prisoners through its networks of sympathetic, or bribed, prison guards, former political prisoners and family members.

Perhaps more than any other organization, the group has succeeded in cutting through the extreme secrecy of Myanmar’s military government. Recent trials have taken place inside a prison in Yangon without lawyers or family members present. The government recently cracked down on lawyers who tried to defend political prisoners, sentencing at least two to jail terms for contempt of court. One lawyer threatened with prosecution, U Kyaw Kyaw Min, 29, fled to Thailand and is now being helped by the association.

The Red Cross has been barred from visiting prisoners for the past three years, and a United Nations envoy for human rights is given a highly circumscribed tour of prisons during now-and-again visits.

David Mathieson, Myanmar consultant for Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy group, said Mr. Bo Kyi and the association had won the respect of diplomats and human rights workers because of their just-the-facts approach.

“They are keeping their efforts very disciplined and very directed,” Mr. Mathieson said. “In terms of the Burmese opposition in exile, it’s the most effective.”

The association for prisoners works out of a small house, shaded by a coconut tree and located in the backyard of a Thai family’s home. Mr. Bo Kyi, who shuffles around in cheap plastic sandals, is paid 8,000 baht a month, about $232.

The staff members surround themselves with reminders of their years in prison. There are authentic leg irons smuggled out by an escaped prisoner, a scale model of Insein prison outside Yangon and a wall with hundreds of photographs of political prisoners.

“We gave up our best years,” Mr. Bo Kyi said, as he scanned the wall of photographs. But he does not want revenge on the government, he said. “What we want is very simple,” he said. “Just freedom of speech.”
570 2009-01-18 Ben Stein astutely observes that highly intelligent advisers in past administrations often did not have the foresight to make sound policy decisions in unusually tough situations (“Ordinary People vs. Extraordinary Problems,” Everybody’s Business, Jan. 11). He also wonders whether the team of President-elect Barack Obama will similarly fail.

In so doing, he touches on an issue that psychologists have grappled with: the importance of emotional versus intellectual ability. The true gift of Franklin D. Roosevelt was his ability to grasp the fear of the American people and inspire them to endure as he experimented with different economic programs.

Let us hope that the very intelligent people in the Obama administration can similarly understand the emotional components of this crisis.
571 2009-01-18 A paper by Kris Gerardi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Lorenz Goette of the University of Geneva and Stephan Meier of Columbia University asked a battery of simple financial literacy questions of recent homebuyers. Many of the respondents could not correctly answer even simple questions, like this one: What will a $300 item cost after it goes on a “50 percent off” sale? (The answer is $150.) They found that people who scored poorly on the financial literacy test also tended to make serious investment mistakes, like borrowing too much, and failing to collect information and shop for a mortgage.

A paper by Liran Einav and Jonathan Levin, both of Stanford, reporting on work with William Adams of Citigroup, shows how sophisticated automobile lenders can be in their loan technology. They use complicated statistical models not only to approve people for credit, but also to fine-tune the down payment and even to suggest what kind of car individuals can buy. This suggests to me that many borrowers can’t match the expertise of lenders.

And another paper, by Paige Marta Skiba of Vanderbilt University and Jeremy Tobacman of the University of Pennsylvania, showed that payday loans — advanced to people who run out of cash before their next paycheck — exploit people’s overoptimism and typically succeed in charging annual rates of interest that may amount to more than 7,000 percent.

One wishes that all this financial cleverness could be focused a bit more on improving the customers’ welfare!

The theory of capitalism, going back to Adam Smith over 200 years ago, sees an alignment of interest between consumers and businesses. Only those companies that produce what consumers really need will succeed. Those that do not will be beaten in the marketplace as consumers shop elsewhere. This puts pressure on providers to innovate and to better satisfy consumer needs.

This theory assumes, however, that consumers are rational in their choices, and to a large extent they are. But in some areas, notably personal finance, it is important to recognize that a good share of Americans have difficulty figuring things out.

Most people get financial advice only from sales representatives of one sort or another: real estate agents, mortgage brokers, sellers of financial products. Some of these providers could use their sophistication to exploit people’s tendency to behave irrationally, and to manipulate the judgment errors that consumers typically make. And competitive pressures tend to make providers promote products that exploit those errors to the hilt, unless, of course, we offer consumers real financial advice.

Such advice is tax deductible, so it is already subsidized indirectly. But most lower-income people do not itemize deductions on their tax returns, so they don’t receive this benefit. In addition, their income tax rates are lower, so the deduction’s benefits can be even less — sometimes zero if they pay no taxes. That’s why it makes sense to subsidize the advice enough that lower-income people will really buy it, much as we do with health care in Medicaid and Medicare. In this case, it means reimbursing qualified private financial advisers for most or, sometimes, all their fees.

SUBSIDIZED financial advisers should be licensed by self-regulatory organizations that verify their qualifications. Licensing will be imperfect, and some incompetent advisers will end up with subsidies. Still, the net effect of getting professional advice to the public is surely positive.

To qualify for a subsidy, the advisers would have to sign a statement promising loyalty to their clients and agreeing to accept only the subsidized hourly fee, and never any commissions or kickbacks. The subsidies might come to $75 an hour, at a very rough estimate, and if 50 million Americans averaged four hours of consultations, the eventual cost might be $15 billion a year — a substantial expenditure, but a worthwhile one.

If personal financial advisers had been subsidized years ago with the best incentives, they still might not have stopped their clients’ bubble thinking during the boom. Many advisers probably thought that housing investments were a good bet. But it’s still likely that advisers who built long-term relationships with their clients, and who pledged to look after their welfare, would have been a helpful influence, suggesting caution to those who were getting over their heads in debt, and warning that adjustable-rate mortgages could be reset upward, just as the fine print said. For these reasons, financial advisers probably would have reduced the severity of the housing bubble.

Professional financial advice is now generally accessible only by the relatively wealthy. Changing this would be an important corrective step. Giving the general public access to trained advisers would be a boon for the nation in this time of doubt and distrust.
572 2009-01-18 Messages to the prime minister’s office asking for comment on Saturday were not returned.

The trouble started Dec. 20 when an official from Mr. Maliki’s governing Dawa Party reported seeing four police officers tearing down campaign posters of one candidate and pasting in their place the posters of a candidate representing Iraqiya. The new posters were for a candidate, Majid Latef al-Amara, who happened to be a cousin of the police chief. Both men are from the Amara tribe, a political power in the province.

The tribe is also well represented in Iraq’s Interior Ministry, which oversees the nation’s police forces. The prime minister and the interior minister, Jawad al-Bolani, have clashed politically in recent weeks.

The removal of the campaign posters of political candidates has become a commonly reported problem in Iraq this election season. The cost of campaign posters is often the primary expense for political candidates here, and competition to place posters in prominent, heavily trafficked spots is fierce.

The Iraqi High Electoral Commission said last week that it had uncovered 45 cases of campaign violations, including tearing down posters, illegally using religious symbols in campaign advertisements and bribery.

In Baghdad, many candidates are handing out gifts to potential supporters, including coupons for free meals for families at popular restaurants, food baskets and leather-bound diaries with the candidates’ names on them. There are also allegations that tribal leaders are getting cash payments to deliver blocs of votes to parties or candidates.

On Saturday, Najat Abdul Hussein, the Dawa official who said she saw the police officers tearing down posters in Wasit Province, said she began to record the police officers with her cellphone, but before she could leave they took it from her. She said that they tried to kidnap her but that she was able to escape in a taxi after breaking a leg and hurting a knee.

She said that after she complained about the incident, arrest warrants were issued for the candidate and one of his cousins, who is a police officer, but that no arrests were made.

“He was replaced because he didn’t implement the law and arrest his cousins,” she said.

The replaced police chief, General Amara, said he was taking his replacement in stride and had been assigned to a position in the Interior Ministry.

“We’re military officers and obey orders,” he said. “This has nothing to do with any political issues.”

Also on Saturday, a brother of Muntader al-Zaidi, the 29-year-old Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush at a Baghdad news conference in December, said he had been allowed to visit him in prison on Friday for the first time in a month.

The journalist’s brother, Maithem al-Zaidi, said the reporter appeared to be in reasonably good health despite having been burned with a cigarette and badly beaten during his imprisonment. Officials promised that the family would be allowed two visits each month, he said.

574 2009-01-18 The inaugural program and surrounding events will feature some of the nation’s most prominent black artists and public figures, including Tiger Woods, Colin L. Powell, Aretha Franklin, Denzel Washington and Beyoncé Knowles.

Adding to the inauguration’s significance is that it comes just one day after the celebration of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., when Mr. Obama will participate in a day of community service in the District of Columbia, a largely black city often ignored by official Washington. Mr. Obama has already signaled his interest in the community.

The Tuskegee Airmen make up just a piece of the inaugural tapestry. Seats were also offered to the Little Rock Nine, who faced violent mobs when they tried to enter an all-white school in 1957 after schools were supposed to be integrated.

“People have a sense of ownership,” said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, a civil rights veteran. Mr. Lewis’s office received 14,000 requests for tickets, though he, like other members of the House, had just 193 to distribute. “People in the rural Deep South, in Greenwood, Miss., in Selma, they feel they helped bring this about, that they should be there.”

One of Mr. Obama’s guests, Dorothy Height, 96, will have a place of honor on the platform — in her wheelchair. Ms. Height, a longtime social activist, was accepted at Barnard College in 1929 but was turned away when she arrived because the school had met its quota of two black women.

“I never thought I would live to see this,” she said of the inauguration of a black president. “This is real recognition that civil rights was not just what Dr. King dreamed. But it took a lot of people a lot of work to make this happen, and they feel part of it.”

The inaugural itself will be at the Capitol, which was built by slaves who baked the bricks, sawed the timber and laid the stone for its foundation. When Mr. Obama delivers his Inaugural Address, he will be looking out across the National Mall, which was once a slave market, beyond the White House, also built by slaves, to the Lincoln Memorial, honoring the president who freed the slaves.

The outpouring is for a man who was rarely explicit about race in nearly two years on the campaign trail. He started out quoting Dr. King by name, but as his candidacy rolled toward the nomination, the words and cadences still reflected Dr. King, but the name vanished.

Mr. Obama made implicit references to race, as when he won the Iowa caucuses. “They said this day would never come,” he said in his victory speech.

It was only when confronted with controversy over his former pastor that Mr. Obama addressed the subject directly, with a well-received speech.

Ronald Walters, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, said that many people, not just the Obama team, wanted to mute the issue of race during the campaign.

“There was this silent understanding on the part of a lot of blacks that you couldn’t surface things in this campaign because they would redound to the enemies of Barack Obama and be used against him,” Mr. Walters said.

But now, he said, with Mr. Obama’s election, many African-Americans feel safer expressing their pride. “Some African-Americans feel we can put forward our claim on the campaign and it’s not going to hurt Barack,” he said. “The campaign is bowing to this because this is part of what made his election possible.”

Roger Wilkins, a former journalist and history professor, said that during the campaign, Mr. Obama “had the task of presenting himself to a country in which it’s clear that being black was not, at least initially, a terrific asset, and being a niche candidate, as Jackson and Sharpton were, wasn’t going to work.”

David Axelrod, a senior Obama adviser, said of the emerging civil rights aura at the inauguration: “We have not stressed the historic nature of this, but it is hard to miss. However people voted, whatever their background, I think there is a pervasive sense of pride among Americans about another barrier broken. It’s an affirmation that we live our ideals.”

Representative James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who grew up under Jim Crow laws, said he had more than 11,000 requests for his 193 tickets and he gave most of them to people who had fought for civil rights.

Mr. Clyburn reserved tickets for a constituent, Lillian Martin, 73, who was determined to go despite having terminal cancer and regardless of whether she had a ticket.

Mrs. Martin died a few days ago. But her husband plans to go in her honor. In an interview shortly before she died, Mrs. Martin said her cancer was “growing by leaps and bounds but it can’t overtake me — there’s too much I’m looking forward to with the inauguration of a black president.”
575 2009-01-18 The answer to each of the questions below is one of the 21 presidential names in the giant "O." If you resolve to do this puzzle, cross off the names as you proceed, since no answer name is used more than once. When all the questions have been answered, the unused name will reveal what all eyes will be focused on come Tuesday.

1. would name a state capital if you changed its fifth letter to an R?

4., 5. becomes another president's name in the "O" if you change the first letter of the first name to a T and rearrange all the letters of the result?

6. completes this bad pun?: "There are no __________ president-elect's first and last names."

8. consists of two consecutive animal names with their last letters (E and O) removed?

9. has its letters in reverse alphabetical order?

10. has three consecutive letters that also appear consecutively, in the same positions, in the president's first name?

11. when you switch the second and fourth letters and turn the result upside down, reads the same?

12. spells a new word if you insert a J between the first and second letters?

13. contains a synonym for "flat" hidden in consecutive letters inside it?

14. is also the brand name of a common household appliance?

15. spells a word meaning "take back" if you add a T at the front and read the result backward?

16. sounds like a sci-fi weapon if you pronounce its two syllables with equal emphasis?

17. could be represented in a cryptogram by the word SCIENCE (that is, has a repeated letter in the second and sixth positions and a different repeated letter in the fourth and seventh positions)?

18. when you drop the last letter and read the remaining letters backward, becomes an adjective describing this president?

19. is an anagram of two consecutive words in this puzzle's instructions?

20. contains a word meaning "finale" spelled by the letters in the even positions (second, fourth, etc.)?
576 2009-01-18 Mr. Griffin has basked in praise — whiz kid, wunderkind, the next Warren Buffett — ever since he began trading from his Harvard dorm room 20 years ago and then moved to Chicago to start his hedge fund. In recent years, his firm handily took in more than $1 billion annually.

But now, the whiz kid has lost so much money that it is unclear whether he can make it all back. That reality is playing out among thousands of troubled hedge funds drowning in losses.

Two out of three hedge funds lost money last year, and according to agreements with investors, their managers are supposed to recoup all losses before they start skimming fees from their profits again. That could take years.

And it’s unclear whether these traders, so accustomed to flush times, will stick it out long enough to make investors whole again.

Their decisions will reverberate beyond Greenwich, Conn., the New York suburb that is a haven for hedge fund honchos. Pension funds, endowments and charities — not just wealthy individuals — all invest in hedge funds.

Assets held by hedge funds surged to nearly $2 trillion as of the start of last year, from $375 billion in 1998, according to estimates from Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago firm. Along the way, hedge funds — once so few in number that they represented a boutique industry populated by a rarefied group of specialists — sprang up like kudzu.

Today, there are around 10,000 hedge funds, compared with around 3,000 a decade ago and just a few hundred two decades ago.

Little other than money unites hedge funds, which invest in areas as varied as bonds, aircraft and small-business loans. They even make bets on the weather.

What they have in common are lucrative fees: managers typically charge 20 percent of profits and 2 percent of total funds under management — the latter of which they earn regardless of performance.

The wealth and power of hedge funds, and those handsome fees, were predicated on what now sounds like a hollow promise: to make money year in and year out.

But the years of easy money are over.

Banks, pinioned by their own enormous mistakes and the economic slump, have cut back on hedge fund lending — essentially turning off a financial spigot that the funds relied upon to goose their returns.

Economic uncertainty makes it harder to predict market movements. And investors, burned by big losses in 2008, are either questioning hedge fund fees or simply avoiding putting more money into the funds.

The regulatory vise, meanwhile, is tightening around an industry that long enjoyed the freedom to trade and operate without the constraints imposed on more traditional firms.

On Thursday, Mary L. Schapiro, Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, said during a confirmation hearing that she plans to more tightly regulate hedge funds as part of an effort to “bring transparency and accountability to all corners of the marketplace.”

Lawmakers are already considering new taxes and regulations that would require hedge funds to disclose more information about their secretive trading strategies.

Add it all up, and managing a hedge fund looks much less attractive than it used to.

“The magnitude of this current crisis and its effect on their business was a real shock for hedge fund managers,” said William N. Goetzmann, a professor who studies hedge funds at the Yale School of Management. “It will be a long-lasting effect because it’s caused customers to question the basic model.”

Mr. Griffin, fiercely competitive, says he is firmly in the camp of those trying to stay open. But he acknowledges that for several years, he will be working mostly for “psychic income.”

NOT everyone is rooting for Citadel. Call up nearly any hedge fund manager, and you will hear the stories about Mr. Griffin, now 40, poaching workers, landing a trade on the cheap and stalking wounded peers for deals. Mr. Griffin declined to comment on such stories.

His aggression has earned him admirers but has also created enemies. In the low-profile hedge fund industry, people shuddered at his brash claims that Citadel would become as powerful as investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

His firm has become the fortress that many would love to see broken. Mr. Griffin knows that, but he chalks it up to his success. “Over the last 10 years we have been innovative and bold,” he says.

But in July, his magic touch deserted him. After reviewing the trading books at Kensington and Wellington, the two largest funds that Citadel manages, he decided to trim some holdings while bolstering an asset class he had traded since his early days: convertible bonds.

But the value of convertibles plummeted as banks, large issuers of such shares, went into a tailspin after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the venerable investment bank.

Citadel made another large bet that the gap between corporate bonds and insurance bought on those bonds, known as credit-default swaps, would narrow. In essence, Mr. Griffin was betting that the economy would strengthen and that the price of insurance on debt would cheapen.

Others in the industry backed away from that particular gambit. Paul Touradji, who runs a fund associated with the veteran trader Julian Robertson, said his own digging indicated that more people would need to sell their bond positions than the number that were likely to buy in.

Still, Mr. Griffin stuck to his guns, even as his funds fell 16 percent in September. The loss put Citadel in the spotlight and generated speculation about its survival.

One day, the rumor was that Federal Reserve officials were trolling his Chicago headquarters; the next, that his funds were selling off troubled assets, or that banks were pulling credit. (Federal Reserve officials did in fact check up on Citadel. But since last spring, such inquiries have become routine at all large financial institutions. The other rumors were unfounded.)

Mr. Griffin says Citadel came under attack because it was a large and easy target — not because it was about to collapse.

By late October, Citadel was fighting for its life. At the end of the month, its funds were down an additional 20 percent and nearing 40 percent losses for the year. Mr. Griffin met with all of his employees and held a public conference call to reassure the world about Citadel’s financial footing.

Mr. Griffin calls that period “surreal” but says he never went to bed worried that Lehman’s fate would become his own. The difference with Citadel, Mr. Griffin says, is financing. He says he has arranged for credit lines at dozens of banks with durations as long as a year, buying him time. “Any firm that is a lasting, permanent institution goes through rough times,” he says. “In three years, they’ll write the story about how we came back, much like Goldman Sachs came back after 1929.”

Citadel, in fact, is different from many hedge funds that specialize only in trading. Mr. Griffin reinvested profits over the years into new service-based businesses. The management company, which is controlled solely by Mr. Griffin, also owns a firm that provides administrative services to other hedge funds, as well as the Citadel Derivatives Group, a major player in the options and stock markets. And Citadel recently hired a former Merrill Lynch executive to build a capital markets business, a mainstay of investment banking.

“Citadel is a diverse platform,” says Matt Andresen, who runs the Derivatives Group. “Our clients do not interact with the asset management side of the firm, and they’ve come to know us in an entirely different capacity.”

Mr. Griffin has full discretion over how much money he uses to subsidize his struggling funds. Last year, Citadel shouldered some of the funds’ operating costs, which are known to be among the largest in the industry.

At the same time, though, Citadel blocked investors in its two troubled hedge funds from withdrawing money at the end of last year. The company has told investors that they might be allowed to withdraw money at the end of March.

Mr. Griffin explains these decisions by saying that “it was the right thing to do,” because withdrawals by some investors might have disadvantaged other investors who remained in the funds. Citadel also canceled its holiday gathering because it was not “right,” he says, to celebrate last year.

But right and wrong in hedge fund land is a matter of debate. Industry veterans have been loudly criticizing fund managers who blocked investors from retrieving money. Leon Cooperman, for instance, who runs Omega Advisors, is suing another hedge fund, contending that it didn’t allow him to make withdrawals; he said his own fund would never block redemptions.

“You’d have to lower me into the ground before I’d put up a gate,” Mr. Cooperman says. “Clients deserve to be able to withdraw their money.”

Orin Kramer, another hedge fund manager, who also helps oversee the New Jersey pension fund, says that what bothers him most is that managers who are freezing their funds are still charging 2 percent management fees on money they have trapped.

“It’s like telling someone at a hotel that they can’t check out and then charging them for the privilege of staying,” Mr. Kramer says.

IN November, five of the country’s richest hedge fund managers filed solemnly into a Congressional hearing room to be grilled by lawmakers.

They made up a Who’s Who of their industry. In addition to Mr. Griffin, the group included James Simons, of Renaissance Technologies; Philip A. Falcone, an activist investor who has bought a large stake in The New York Times; John Paulson, who earned billions of dollars betting against mortgages before the crisis; and George Soros, the Hungarian trader who rode to fame on prescient currency trades in the early 1990s.

Unlike banks or brokerages, hedge funds do not have to reveal information on their financial condition to the government. That means the government has no way to know the value of funds’ assets, how much money they borrow, or even how many funds there are.

For years, the industry has argued that hedge funds should be allowed to operate under the radar because they serve sophisticated investors.

But by November, it had become apparent that too many hedge funds, crammed into too many of the same trades, had been forced to sell — and that they did not operate in some distant universe. Like mutual funds, they can roil the markets.

At the hearing, four of the managers surprised lawmakers and their peers by saying that more regulation of their business was needed.

Mr. Griffin was the lone holdout. He argued for private market solutions, but as the hearing proceeded, he conceded that he would “not be averse” to greater disclosure to the government, provided that it was not made public. He says now that he is working on providing more transparency to his investors.

“I believe there’s been a near-consensus that hedge funds can cause systemic risk,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York and a member of the House Financial Services Committee.

Even without government intervention, the days of working behind a curtain may be ending. Investors are already demanding more information about hedge funds’ operations.

Eiichiro Kuwana, president of Cook Pine Capital, a firm in Greenwich, Conn., that helps wealthy people invest in hedge funds, says that investors once had so much money to invest that they became less circumspect — with many of them investing in hedge funds that refused to provide much information.

“Why would I trust a fund with my money if they won’t trust me with information?” Mr. Kuwana says.

HEDGE FUNDS tend to close by choice; outright collapses are less common. Sometimes banks pull funds’ credit lines and managers are forced to shut down. But by and large, the end comes when a manager no longer sees a financial upside for himself or herself.

Few funds have actually shut their doors. The number of funds peaked early last year at 10,233, according to Hedge Fund Research, and fell just 4 percent during the year. And they still manage $1.6 trillion.

Of the funds that lost money last year, the average loss was 29 percent, according to estimates from HedgeFund.net, a research firm. It will take a few years of fairly robust gains — no easy feat in these markets — for funds to simply recoup those losses.

Until then, managers would earn only their 2 percent fee, chump change to most hedge funds. Some managers are already paying talented employees out of their own pockets to persuade them to stay, but it’s apparent that surviving this turbulence isn’t in the cards for scores of funds.

Mr. Touradji of Touradji Capital was one of the few managers to make money last year, up 13 percent. He says that most firms that call themselves hedge funds never really deserved the title.

“There’s any number of good violinists, but how many people are good enough to be considered to conduct the Philharmonic?” he says. “The whole concept of hedge funds was always and still is this very high bar, that you were never allowed to say it was a tough market. Come rain or shine, you were supposed to do well — even in tough markets.”

But he predicts a slow death for the poseurs. Hedge fund managers, he says, may behave like restaurateurs who keep the doors open long after losses mount, largely because they don’t want to work in someone else’s kitchen.

For his part, Mr. Griffin is not likely to be job-hunting any time soon.

While there is no way to calculate his net worth, it is thought to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars. In May, a monument to his riches will be unveiled at the Art Institute of Chicago. He and his wife donated $19 million for Griffin Court, part of a new modern wing that connects the museum to Millennium Park. And they are hoping they will have plenty of money for their Ph.D. graduate to give out by 2010.

As for Mr. Griffin’s troubled hedge funds, their survival will pivot on successful trading — they are up 6 percent this year — and on his willingness to use Citadel’s other units as a safety net.

Whatever happens, Mr. Griffin says he can handle the shakeout in the hedge fund industry. “It’s going to be fairly significant, “ he says, then pauses and grins. “It’s part of capitalism.”
577 2009-01-18 Individually, banks that received some of the first $350 billion from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, have offered few public details about how they plan to spend the money, and they are not required to disclose what they do with it. But in conversations behind closed doors with investment analysts, some bankers have been candid about their intentions.

Most of the banks that received the money are far smaller than behemoths like Citigroup or Bank of America. A review of investor presentations and conference calls by executives of some two dozen banks around the country found that few cited lending as a priority. An overwhelming majority saw the bailout program as a no-strings-attached windfall that could be used to pay down debt, acquire other businesses or invest for the future.

Speaking at the FBR Capital Markets conference in New York in December, Walter M. Pressey, president of Boston Private Wealth Management, a healthy bank with a mostly affluent clientele, said there were no immediate plans to do much with the $154 million it received from the Treasury.

“With that capital in hand, not only do we feel comfortable that we can ride out the recession,” he said, “but we also feel that we’ll be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves once this recession is sorted out.”

The bankers’ comments, while representing only a random sampling of the more than 200 financial institutions that have received TARP money so far, underscore a growing gulf between public expectations for how the $700 billion should be used and the decisions being made by many of the institutions that have taken part. The program does not dictate what banks should do with the money.

The loose requirements in the original plan have contributed to confusion over what the Treasury intended when it abruptly shelved its first proposal — to buy up bad mortgages — in favor of making direct investments in individual banks in return for preferred shares of stock.

The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in October that banks should “deploy, not hoard” the money to build confidence and increase lending. He added: “We expect all participating banks to continue to strengthen their efforts to help struggling homeowners who can afford their homes avoid foreclosure.”

But a Congressional oversight panel reported on Jan. 9 that it found no evidence the bailout program had been used to prevent foreclosures, raising questions about whether the Treasury has complied with the law’s requirement that it develop a “plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners.”

The report concluded that the Treasury’s top priority seemed to be to “stabilize financial markets” by simply giving healthy banks more money and letting them decide how best to use it. The report also said it was not clear how giving billions to banks “advances both the goal of financial stability and the well-being of taxpayers, including homeowners threatened by foreclosure, people losing their jobs, and families unable to pay their credit cards.”

For the banks, fearful that the economic downturn could deepen and wary of risking additional losses, the question of what to do with the bailout money comes down to self-preservation.

Mark Fitzgibbon, research director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners, which sponsored the Palm Beach conference, said banks seemed to be allocating the bailout money for four general purposes: increased lending, absorbing losses, bolstering capital and “opportunistic acquisitions.” He said those approaches made sense from a business perspective, even though they might not conform to popular expectations that the money would be immediately lent to consumers.

“For the banking industry, this isn’t a sprint, this is a marathon,” Mr. Fitzgibbon said. “I think over time there will be pressure to lend that capital out and get a return for their shareholders. But they’re not going to rush out and lend all that money tomorrow. If they did, they could lose it.”

For City National Bank in Los Angeles, the Treasury money “really doesn’t change our perspective about doing things,” said Christopher J. Carey, the bank’s chief financial officer, addressing the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference in November. He said that his bank would like to use it for lending and acquisitions but that the decision would depend on the economy.

“Adding $400 million in capital gives us a chance to really have a totally fortressed balance sheet in case things get a lot worse than we think,” Mr. Carey said. “And if they don’t, we may end up just paying it back a little bit earlier.”

In addition to wanting more lending, members of Congress have said TARP should not be used to fuel mergers and acquisitions, although Treasury officials say the financial system would be strengthened if healthy banks absorbed weaker ones. To that extent, bailout money has been useful for improving capital ratios — the amount of money available to absorb losses — for banks that merge.

On Friday, Bank of America said it would receive $20 billion more from the Treasury to help it digest losses it took on by acquiring Merrill Lynch, a process begun in September.

At least seven banks that received TARP money have since bought other companies, including one that had been encouraged to do so by federal regulators. That one, PNC Financial Services, took $7.7 billion from the Treasury and promptly acquired the struggling National City Bank for $5.2 billion in stock and $384 million in cash.

Among the others, PlainsCapital Bank of Dallas announced in November, not long after the bailout program began, that it planned to merge with a healthy investment bank, First Southwest. PlainsCapital received $88 million from the Treasury on Dec. 19, and the all-stock merger was completed two weeks later. PlainsCapital’s chairman, Alan B. White, insisted in an interview that the two events were not connected.

He said the bank had not yet decided what to do with its bailout money, which he called “opportunity capital.” Increased lending would be a priority, said Mr. White, who did not rule out using it for other acquisitions, adding that when regulators invited PlainsCapital to apply for federal dollars, there were no conditions attached.

“They didn’t tell me I had to do anything particular with it,” he said.

None of the bankers who appeared before recent investor conferences offered specific details about their intentions, but recurring themes emerged in their presentations. Two of the most often cited priorities were hanging on to the money as insurance against a prolonged recession and using it for mergers.

At the Sandler O’Neill East Coast Financial Services Conference in Florida, bankers mingled with investment analysts at an ocean-front luxury hotel, where the agenda featured evening cocktails by the pool and a golf outing at a nearby country club.

During his presentation, John R. Buran, the chief executive of Flushing Financial in New York, said the government money was a way to up the “ante for acquisitions” of other companies.

“We can get $70 million in capital,” he said. “So, I would say the price of poker, so to speak, has gone up.”

For Mr. Hope, the Whitney National Bank chairman, “the main motivation for TARP” was not more loans, but rather to safeguard against the “possibility things could get a lot worse.” He said Whitney would continue making loans “that we would have made with or without TARP.”

“We see TARP as an insurance policy,” he said. “That when all this stuff is finally over, no matter how bad it gets, we’re going to be one of the remaining banks.”
578 2009-01-18 Gaël Monfils, another Frenchman, should be there soon, as should Ernests Gulbis, an unpredictable player from Latvia, and perhaps Marin Cilic, a rangy Croat coached by Bob Brett, who helped develop Goran Ivanisevic.

Dangerous, still-motivated veterans include Andy Roddick, Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, David Nalbandian of Argentina and another Frenchman, Richard Gasquet.

The fifth-ranked Davydenko, who has an injured heel, is the only one of the leading men who will miss the Australian Open.

“I thought last year was a really interesting year, with so much to play for for a lot of people,” said Darren Cahill, a top coach and commentator. “But I think we’re in for an even more fascinating season this year, potentially one of the most fascinating we’ve had in many years.”

The British would concur. Interest is peaking in Murray, a 21-year-old Scotsman who lived through the 1996 Dunblane school shootings as a child and who was coached in his formative years by his mother, Judy. In search of a greater challenge, he spent part of his teens based in Spain.

Murray is the only one of the top four who not won a Grand Slam singles title, and he was beaten soundly by Federer in last year’s United States Open final. But that was the only time Murray lost to Federer in four matches in 2008, and after beating him this month in the semifinals in Doha, Qatar, on his way to the title, he holds a 5-2 edge over Federer, of Switzerland.

Although Murray is only 1-5 against Nadal, he beat him in their most recent match, in the semifinals of last year’s United States Open. Murray has also won his last two matches against his friend and former doubles partner Djokovic, although Djokovic won their first four.

To sum up, it is not at all unreasonable for the British to expect great things from Murray this season, particularly on the hardcourts he prefers.

Murray is trying to tap on the brakes, reminding everyone that he won in Doha last year, then lost in the first round of the Australian Open to Tsonga. That defeat that did not seem so embarrassing after Tsonga swept through his next five opponents, including Nadal, to reach the final. But Murray seems a more even-tempered, balanced competitor this January.

“He matured remarkably last season,” Cahill said. “I haven’t seen a maturation from the first six months of a season to the second six months like that in a long time. He’s not wasting emotions on court now. He’s going about his business and has the confidence and legitimately feels like he belongs, which he certainly does.

“He has every shot in the book, and the biggest thing about his game, which I feel is kind of underrated, is his ability to cover the court. He’s lightning fast and makes his side of the court seem small to his opponents. At any given moment, he can change the pace of the game. He can carve you up or hit one lights-out for a winner.”

Amid all the chatter about Murray, it is easy to forget that the defending champion is Djokovic, the intelligent Serb who won the year-end championship in Shanghai.

Djokovic, born in the same month as Murray, will arrive with a new racket after switching brands, to Head from Wilson, this year. That is hardly a minor decision for any leading player, for whom the slightest changes in feel can play tricks with timing and confidence.

“It’s a very hard thing to do,” Djokovic said last week in Sydney, Australia. “Probably the most difficult decision in tennis, switching the racket when things are going good and with the way I finished the season.”

The money must have been terrific, and it remains to be determined whether Djokovic’s opening-round, straight-set loss to Gulbis in Brisbane, Australia, this month was a hint of struggles to come or another reminder of Gulbis’s potential.

For now, Gulbis is ranked 50 spots below Djokovic.

“Gulbis is the one to watch from my point of view,” Cahill said. “I’ve seen him play tennis where I was thinking: ‘Oh, my God. Why is he not in the top 10?’ And then I’ve seen him play and said, ‘Well, that’s why!’ Once he harnesses everything, he is a treat to watch. But I think until then, it’s still reasonably frustrating for Gulbis supporters.”

Not nearly as frustrating as it is for Maria Sharapova’s fans. A year ago, she seemed ready to become the next dominant champion after routing all comers to win the Australian Open for her third Grand Slam title. But chronic shoulder pain, linked to two tears in her right rotator cuff, forced her off the tour in August. She had arthroscopic surgery in October but did not feel prepared enough to return. She will not play in Melbourne and will drop well out of the top 10.

What remains is hardly a star vacuum, not with Serena Williams and Venus Williams still motivated and in good health. But Sharapova’s absence combined with Justine Henin’s surprise retirement last season have knocked some of the broader appeal out of the women’s game.

Like the men, the women have something resembling parity at the top. The difference is that none of the leading men are missing.

“What’s missing in the women’s game is the contrast of styles,” said Harold Solomon, the former coach of Jennifer Capriati and Mary Joe Fernandez, who now works regularly with Elena Dementieva.

Two of the most promising potential stars, Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, will not change that equation. They, too, are power baseliners and superlative athletes.

What is not missing in the women’s game is suspense. Four different women won a Grand Slam singles title last year; another, Dementieva, won the Olympic gold medal in singles. But none of those five finished No. 1. That title went to Jelena Jankovic, the gregarious Serb who spent part of her off-season beefing up her serve and her physique and appears, along with the Williams sisters, to be on the shortlist of favorites.

Venus has yet to win in Australia, but Serena seems to like odd years here; she won in 2003, ’05 and ’07. Ana Ivanovic, Dinara Safina and Dementieva, whose serve and self-confidence may have improved enough to put her in range of a first Grand Slam singles title, are also in the picture.

“I told her this is a unique time in women’s tennis right now, and there’s an opportunity for you to be able to do that if you really believe in yourself,” Solomon said. “She’s almost too humble in that way, almost embarrassed about being cocky, almost embarrassed about thinking that she’s really good. In order to be No. 1 in the world, you have to know it and feel it and believe it and expect it. She’s working on that.”
579 2009-01-18 Now his profile has soared higher than it was at Pittsburgh in 2003, when he finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting. More people now know he used to be a Minnesota Vikings ball boy, that his father is a sports journalist and that Fitzgerald hands the ball to officials after touchdowns instead of celebrating.

They know he travels alone to places like South America, Europe and Australia. And that he received a four-year contract with a $30 million guarantee before this season, then led the N.F.C. with 96 receptions and 1,431 yards.

But sometimes the spotlight also illuminates personal stories that are not as upbeat. At a news conference on Friday, Fitzgerald talked only about football, not off-field matters. He wore eyeglasses, a necktie and a sweater. His hair was tied back, revealing a pair of diamond earrings. He stood at a lectern and addressed reporters sitting at desks as if he were a college professor teaching a class.

“I love what I do,” Fitzgerald said. He was asked if he had learned professional etiquette by cleaning up after athletes as a teenager or by having a father in the sports media.

“My dad used to give me a lot of spankings,” Fitzgerald said. “Anything I did wrong, he was on me. I was raised by a strict disciplinarian. He kind of laid down the law.”

Then Fitzgerald looked across the room, smiled at his father, Larry Sr., and said hello. Afterward, Larry Sr. — who works in radio and television and for a weekly newspaper in Minnesota — discussed his son.

Among the topics was his son’s complicated relationship with his mother, Carol, who died of cancer in 2003. At the time, they were estranged.

“He was hurt so much,” Larry Sr. said. “He didn’t get to settle some things with her. When he’s playing, he feels like he’s doing what he can to say, I’m sorry, Mom.”

Fitzgerald, who keeps his mother’s driver’s license in his wallet, had “a little falling-out” with her about one of his girlfriends, Larry Sr. said.

“It kind of festered, ,” he added. “They both were stubborn. Then it was too late.”

In her memory, the Fitzgeralds sponsor the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund to help victims of AIDS and other diseases. She was a state worker who tracked sexually transmitted diseases. The family has a benefit every spring in Minneapolis. Larry Sr. said the current spotlight on his son might help their charity.

Fitzgerald has dealt with other uncomfortable family matters. He is the father of a year-old son, whose mother, Angela Nazario, took legal action last year to establish paternity. Then she accused Fitzgerald of domestic violence and got an order of protection against him.

“She’s trying to get a lot of money,” Larry Sr. said. The lawyer for Nazario, Louis Diesel, said in a telephone interview Friday that he could not discuss the case because it has been sealed by a judge.

Nazario, a former Oakland Raiders cheerleader, did not respond to an interview request made through Diesel. Larry Sr. said that his son had acknowledged paternity and that “Larry is a devoted father.”

Then he discussed other aspects of parenting a star. He told of sending his son to a military academy after high school because he needed better grades.

“It was a sacrifice,” Larry Sr. said. “We were scared. He wasn’t excited. But he put himself in that position.”

When someone asked about his son’s reluctance to talk to reporters, Larry Sr. said: “Blame it on me. I told him as a kid, When you win, you say little, and when you lose, you say less.”

Larry Sr., who said he had reported on every Super Bowl since Philadelphia-Oakland in 1981, recalled that his son almost went to one with the Vikings in 1999, but they lost to Atlanta in the N.F.C. championship game.

This year, father and son may meet there on the job. No matter what happens on Sunday, Larry Sr. will evaluate his son’s performance not as a journalist but as a parent.

“He gets the unedited version,” Larry Sr. said.
580 2009-01-18 MIAMI — A Florida money manager is missing and the police have opened an investigation into the possible disappearance of “hundreds of millions” of dollars, according to the authorities.

The police are searching for Arthur Nadel, 75, a prominent Sarasota philanthropist and fund manager who was reported missing by his family Wednesday. He left a note, described as a suicide note by The Sarasota Herald- Tribune, that reported that investors could be out as much as $350 million.

The Sarasota police are investigating complaints from at least five investors in Mr. Nadel’s funds, run from a management office in Sarasota, that their money has disappeared.

“It was brought to our attention that there has been a very significant number of victims with a very significant amount of money that has disappeared,” Captain Bill Spitler of the Sarasota police said. “Allegedly it’s hundreds of millions of dollars.”

The investigation began just over a month after the authorities arrested Bernard L. Madoff, the suspected mastermind of a Ponzi scheme that may have cost investors $50 billion.
581 2009-01-18 “This is very much a tester building, to see what the demand is in the Bronx for this product,” she said.

Since July, three offers had been placed on the remaining four units, but Ms. Faulls said the bids were too low to be acceptable by the developer. The prices range from $245,000 for a two-bedroom unit to $550,000 for a three-bedroom penthouse. “A two-bedroom for $300,000,” she said. “You can’t find one in Queens; you can’t find one in Brooklyn.”

While disappointed at the no-shows the other day, Ms. Faulls acknowledged that the state of the economy was making buyers more skeptical.

As she put it: “I think people have double minds about everything right now when it comes to real estate. ‘Do I wait; do I do this? I love it; it’s right for me, but the market is crazy.’ ”

The following day, the open house proved more successful, with five prospective buyers stopping by, among them Falani Piggot, a 30-year-old auditor for a pharmaceutical company.

Ms. Piggot, who lives in Queens Village, said she was interested in the building regardless of the promotions because of its high-end materials and sleek design, although she added that the incentives might prove to be the deciding factor as to whether she ultimately made an offer.

“The fact that they are covering closing costs offset that a bit,” Ms. Piggot said. According to a price sheet, the closing costs on a $345,000 apartment would be nearly $17,000.

Peter Milosheff, a 30-year-old bank associate who lives in the financial district, also visited Park South last Sunday. Mr. Milosheff, who has been apartment hunting for a year, mostly near Wall Street, said he came across an ad for the condos while researching a Bronx business venture on the side.

“It’s a nice building, and it has a great location in a borough that I believe is going to experience a great deal of development,” Mr. Milosheff said. But he conceded that incentives would take a back seat to the state of the economy. “Everything is contingent on my job situation.”
582 2009-01-18 HENRY SUSS, a 93-year-old retired engineer with a hearing aid in each ear, has a hard time getting around. Since suffering a heart attack in 2006, he has been unable to walk more than a block without pain in his legs and feet. So about twice a week, he calls a day in advance to arrange a trip — to a restaurant, to a concert or to one of his many doctors’ appointments — through Access-a-Ride, the city’s door-to-door paratransit service for the elderly and the disabled.

Mr. Suss, who lives at the Hallmark, an assisted-living and retirement center in Battery Park City, pays $2 a ride. But while all transit riders can expect a fare hike this year — the Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted public hearings last week on the proposal — the 123,000 users of Access-a-Ride may well face a much steeper increase, according to Kevin Ortiz, an M.T.A. spokesman. Under two of the four plans that the authority is considering to close its budget gap, the Access-a-Ride fare would more than double, to $4.50 or even $5.

“If I have to pay, I have to pay,” Mr. Suss said about the possibility of a much higher fare. “But I resent that when my income is going down, everything else is going up.”

Asked why Access-a-Ride customers would shoulder such a comparatively steep increase, Mr. Ortiz said the guidelines of the Americans With Disabilities Act allow paratransit fares to run up to twice the base fare. He added that the authority is one of the few mass transit agencies in the country that doesn’t already charge double the base fare; the paratransit systems in Atlanta, Miami, Denver and Philadelphia do. All other aspects of the paratransit service, he added, will remain the same.

Jan Zimmerman, the program director at Rivington House, a Medicaid-financed health care program on the Lower East Side for adults with H.I.V. or AIDS, said that of the program’s 65 clients, 8 depend on Access-a-Ride for transportation. Rivington House reimburses them for the fare, she said, explaining, “The priority is to get the client here for service.” Rivington House will continue to reimburse clients even if the fare rises, she said, but this would require cuts in meal service, supplies or the occasional trips to a movie or a museum.

One 45-year-old client, who asked that his name be withheld because he was H.I.V. positive, said he used Access-a-Ride several times a week to travel to Rivington House from his home in Queens Village.
583 2009-01-18 Just the way New Yorkers think about things, it’s distinctive. It’s not radically different from the way people in Baltimore, for example, think, but there is a New Yorker mentality. And I think part of why City Hall and The Capitol have been successful is because we have a cast of characters in this town that has got to be unmatched.

Think about it: Eliot Spitzer, when he was governor; David Paterson; Chuck Schumer; Hillary Clinton. This is what we’re dealing with. This is a reporter’s dream. And then you’ve got 51 members of the City Council. Out of 51, I would say probably 43 are really interesting, and the rest are moderately interesting.

And you kind of need to be really interesting to be in politics in New York. I mean, Chuck Schumer is a character, and he’s a presence. And I think that not only would Chuck Schumer probably have never been able to get elected in, I don’t know, Idaho, but they just wouldn’t know what to do with him. But in New York it’s, “Oh, it’s Schumer.”

I can’t imagine there will ever be a year in New York politics like the year we have just had. You have a new governor and you’re going to have a new senator, but you’re also going to have a new chief judge and you have a new Senate majority leader. You’ve got a Democratic congressman in Staten Island. In Staten Island? That would have seemed huge in a year that we didn’t have all the rest of this.

And in addition to that, you’ve got a budget crisis. You’ve got the constitution of the city, the charter, rewritten by people to whom it applied. And it happened in three weeks. And that would have been the huge story of the year, but instead you’ve got Eliot Spitzer, who didn’t come down in a sex scandal; he came down in a prostitution scandal.

I think it’s one of my strengths as a person, or as a reporter, that I really pay attention to politics, but I also like going to the opera and the movies and reading books. I was on vacation and read the David Michaelis book about Charles Schulz and Peanuts.

I didn’t want to read about politics. I’m not crazy obsessed with this stuff. I have conversations with people who don’t know much about this stuff, who will say, “Here’s what I know is going on,” or “This is really the way the mayor’s race is going to shape up.”

They’ll say something and they don’t really know what they’re talking about. And I’m like, “Well. ...” And they say, “How do you know?” And I say, “Well, I do know.” And they say, “Where are you getting your information from?” And I’m like, “From the people who are in that race, who I just talked to.” I try to be as polite as I can be.

The flip side of it is that because I have the job as the editor of a political publication, when things happen that everyone wants to know about, everybody’s like, “Who’s going to be the new senator?” I’m like, “I don’t know!”

On election night this year, I was at the party for the State Democratic Party, which was at the Sheraton in Midtown, and I don’t remember exactly what point in the night it was, but it was after it was clear that Obama had won. My little brother, who just graduated from college and is working in D.C., called me.

He’s more partisan than I am allowed to be. And he said, “This is crazy!” You know, it’s his first big presidential election. And I said, “Yeah, you know, and it looks like the Democrats won the State Senate, too.” And he’s like, “Yeah, O.K., Isaac.”
584 2009-01-18 An article on Jan. 11 about the PBS documentary “Make ’Em Laugh” and a letter on Jan. 18 responding to the article referred incorrectly to the comedian Bob Newhart. He was in fact among those who appeared in the documentary (although he was not featured at length); he was not omitted.
585 2009-01-18 For two years now the epithet “historic” has been affixed to Barack Obama — first during the primary season, then during the general election, again when he captured the presidency and now once more as he prepares to take office in times as difficult as any in modern memory. Yet “historic” is an ambiguous term. It implies something new, a break from all that has gone before, but also presupposes that the figure in question must confront the cumulative weight, or legacy, of the past.

This theme connects the reviews and essays in our Inauguration Issue, whether it is Anthony Lewis parsing the “I Have a Dream” speech of Martin Luther King Jr., David Greenberg reassessing the New Deal, Gary Hart examining the attributes of effective presidential leadership on foreign policy, or Ross Douthat illuminating the tension between ideas and passions that has long beset American conservatism.

In one form or another these questions are likely to resurface during the Obama presidency — as unfolding events, and his responses to them, shape the living history of the next four years.
586 2009-01-18 Pastas are the foundation of Enzzo’s (a whimsically-spelled diminutive of Mr. Urso’s first name), and the restaurant has worked out the formula: huge portions and too much sauce, but plenty of flavor. Pasta Romano, a blend of bow ties with white beans, escarole, black olives, marinated artichokes and house-roasted red peppers, benefits from having bits of pancetta through the dish. The rigatoni Bolognese, also from a family recipe, looks festive with its sprinkling of green peas, though the sauce was somewhat sticky. The same was true of the gnocchi, though it was the potato pasta, and not the pleasant ricotta cheese and tomato sauce, that did the sticking.

Among the main courses, a fresh slab of cod, broiled in tomato-herb sauce with capers, onions and more of those black olives, was simply delicious. Veal saltimbocca was beguilingly flavored, with its surfeit of brown sage sauce mixing with prosciutto and truly too much mozzarella; the raw spinach in the dish would have been better cooked, though, and in more generous quantities, and the meat had an occasional bit of gristle. The slim eggplant cutlets were over the top — stuffed with ricotta, pecorino and prosciutto and buried under too much tomato sauce and mozzarella — but the leftovers were eaten and appreciated. On another night, the shrimp oreganata was my favorite: exceedingly tender jumbo shrimp atop a too-generous bed of thin spaghetti, all swimming in a sauce of lemon, white wine and oregano that threatened to flow over the side of the plate and into my lap.

That’s where the bread came in — the restaurant’s rolls, served hot, with a shatteringly crisp crust surrounding an innocuous center, worked as a foil to any extra sauce, but when I think of Italian bread, I wish for something more interesting. I wish, too, for Italian-style vegetables — broccoli, broccoli rabe, cauliflower, cabbage and kale, Swiss chard, radicchio, zucchini and other squash. They are in short supply here, unfortunately.

Enzzo’s slips on desserts — they were unremarkable, as were the coffees, and not worth the wait. But no matter: The sweetness at this restaurant is simply good and plenty, warmly delivered.

587 2009-01-18 AS every real estate broker knows, even after many months of hard work, something can go wrong at a closing. But one nightmare, endemic in New York for decades, ended this month with the passage of the Commission Escrow Act, signed into law last summer by Gov. David A. Paterson.

The new law ensures that every closing — as contractually agreed by all sellers going in — will include a broker’s full sales commission.

If there’s a dispute, the funds go into escrow, with the county clerk’s office and an administrative judge handling their disposition.

No longer can disappointed or fed-up sellers punish their brokers by withholding the agreed-upon commissions, as many have done over the years.

“We need a way to protect our income,” said Linda Page, a 37-year industry veteran and until Dec. 31 the president of the New York State Association of Realtors. “We’ve been working on this issue for a very long time. You’ve done the work, earned your money and you’re entitled to be paid.”
588 2009-01-18 For years, a debate raged among Middle East analysts on how connected the many conflicts in the region were. One side argued, in essence, that all roads led to Jerusalem. Solve the core problem — the Israeli-Palestinian dispute — and much of the tension elsewhere would dissipate. The other side countered that the Sunni-Shia split in Iraq, the revolutionary fervor in Iran, the sectarian stew in Lebanon and the sclerotic authoritarianism of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia would be little affected by any deal over Palestine. Each issue required its own approach.

The debate is not over, but there is an emerging consensus for a third way. All the roads that used to lead to Jerusalem now lead to Tehran. Meet the Iranian challenge, it is said, and most everything else falls into place — Iraq (where Iran meddles with the Shia majority), Syria (with which it is closely allied), Lebanon (where it has vast influence over Hezbollah) and Palestine (where it equips and trains Hamas and Islamic Jihad). Through Tehran, every one of the major concerns in the region is connected to nearly every other one. Because of Tehran none can be solved in isolation. And if Iran goes nuclear, everything becomes hugely more problematic.

The best way to face up to Iran, according to the emerging consensus, is through a grand bargain that not only links ending Israeli settlement in the West Bank to halting nuclear proliferation, but also ties stopping planned American missile installations in Central Europe (which anger Moscow, needed as a partner for the deal) to stability and democracy in Lebanon. With the Iranian centrifuges continuing to spin, the Middle East cannot wait.

Beginning in July 2007, two of this country’s pre-eminent Middle East policy research institutions, both with close ties to the incoming administration, the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations, took the rare step of joining forces and asking 15 of their scholars to focus on the crucial challenges facing the next president. The results are collected in “Restoring the Balance,” a thoughtful and nicely structured collection of seven essays that examine the Iranian challenge and its many parts. (Disclosure: I am a member of the Council on Foreign Relations but had no involvement with this book.)

The assumption informing all the essays is that the Bush years have been a catastrophe. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have unwittingly increased Iranian power. Refusing to talk with Iran and downgrading relations with Damascus have kept Washington in the dark about those countries’ shifting internal forces. Insisting on elections among the Palestinians without realizing the strength of Hamas and then refusing to accept the results only added insult to injury.
589 2009-01-18 The odds that they would be picked, with the likes of polished groups like Grambling State’s Tiger Marching Band or the Fightin’ Blue Hen Marching Band of the University of Delaware, were slim. But they were, and for some of these kids, the experience has already proved life-changing.

The story began in November 2008, when William M. Powers, chief executive at Bonnie Brae, submitted a parade application to the inaugural committee. Bonnie Brae was founded in 1916, but the Knights were new, having made their first public appearance in 2004 at a local parade where they marched with drums lashed to their waists with rope. Since then, the staff member who developed the corps and taught them African beats had retired. On the application, Mr. Powers stated that the Knights consisted of 12 drummers, although in a school where children come and go often, the number tended to fluctuate.

Mr. Powers, 57, wrote to the committee that boys arrive at Bonnie Brae “with a long laundry list of negative labels,” but that they “leave with pride and hope for the future.” To include the Knights would “offer a powerful message of hope and dreams,” he wrote, though he later said he never thought the boys would be chosen.

Parade officials received a record 1,382 applications, three times the usual number. But a couple of weeks later, Mr. Powers received a call: Bonnie Brae was among the first 49 organizations selected.

“I nearly fell off my chair,” he said.

The squad’s original drum teacher, William Randolph, who was hospitalized with health problems, was just as surprised.

“I’m so proud of them, I don’t know what to say,” said Mr. Randolph, known as Brother Will, in a phone interview last month.

The news was announced at a special assembly, along with a request for more drummers.

No experience was needed, just the ability to mark time and a good attitude.

Local and national media also descended on Bonnie Brae. The Star-Ledger of Newark wrote that the Knights had no uniforms, and not enough drums or sticks. The article triggered a flood of more than 350 donations worth nearly $40,000, which paid for transportation to Washington, new uniforms and shoes, new drums, and other expenses. It also brought the Knights an invitation to appear in the 2009 West Virginia Strawberry Festival in May.

Bonnie Brae did not shield the boys from being interviewed, though it did not allow publication of their last names. Some people in child welfare circles were surprised at the center’s willingness to take a risk.

“My peers around the country have said: ‘You’re doing what? The kids are going to march in Washington?’ ” Mr. Powers said. “The common wisdom in residential treatment centers like this is, that’s too risky, that you should put a wall around your campus, and pray nothing happens” to attract public attention.

By this time Bonnie Brae had hired two instructors from the Spirit of Newark Drum and Bugle Corps, a competitive performing organization, to whip the Knights into shape.

Harold Wright, director of the Newark corps, said he knew he had his work cut out for him the first time he saw them.

“They really couldn’t play,” said Mr. Wright, 72. “It was terrible.”

But he was not deterred.

“The kids seem like they want to learn, and they will learn. They’re going to be ready,” he said. “We want to make these kids feel that they’re worth something.”

The Knights practiced every school day afternoon and three evenings a week. Two child care counselors were always on hand, to enforce discipline and master the same three beats the boys had to learn — a modified version of Brother Will’s African beat, a military-type beat, and a beat with a pop sound.

In the beginning Mr. Wright had the boys spend most of their time drumming on tables.

“They really weren’t ready for drums,” he said. “They didn’t know the rudiments.”

Staff members used the parade as a carrot and warned that boys who misbehaved would be left behind. It was not an idle threat. One teenager who verbally abused a therapist one day was dropped from the ranks. Sandel, on the other hand, a tall, thin 15-year-old with a reputation for being aggressive, stopped getting in trouble.

“When I choose to do something, I stick to it,” Sandel said, acknowledging a compliment about improved behavior. “When I find something to focus on, I don’t fail.”

Mr. Wright, meanwhile, presided at practice like a staff sergeant, barking out orders.

When two boys complained that the drums and harnesses hurt their backs, he furrowed his brow and told them to get used to it.

But when another said he was worried about the marching, Mr. Wright put a hand on his shoulder.

“Don’t worry about the marching. All marching is, is walking with pride,” he said. “You guys sound good.”

As Inauguration Day drew nearer, the boys got more and more excited. But they were also anxious.

Jameer, at 13 the youngest Knight but a focused and capable tenor drummer, said he was worried about his ability to play when he saw Mr. Obama. After taking the oath of office at the Capitol, the new president and his family watch the parade from a reviewing stand at the White House.

“I’m worried I’ll just stop when I see Obama,” Jameer said.

The boys’ trip south is scheduled to begin at 3 a.m. on Inauguration Day, when a bus — one of 10,000 expected to descend on Washington — pulls into Bonnie Brae.

About 9 a.m. they will be dropped off at a giant warming tent, but they will not march until around 3 p.m. (The new president is scheduled to be sworn in at noon)

Parading in front of the Bonnie Brae contingent will be the Freedom Riders, a group of patriotically costumed Colorado women on horseback. To their rear will be the Ceremonial Honor Guard of the Secret Service Uniformed Division.

The boys will cover three miles on foot. First, they will walk a mile and a half, carrying their drums. Then they will march the same distance, drumming. Mr. Powers and Mike Flaherty, one of the counselors who has guided the boys through the last five weeks, will be at their side.

Like the boys, Mr. Flaherty, 42, is excited. And worried.

“My fear is that one or maybe two of my kids won’t be able to make it, and will quit,” he said. “I’m also concerned about the weight of the drums and the weather. I don’t want them to be uncomfortable. This should be one of the most memorable moments of their lives.

“I’m going to tell them: ‘If you make a mistake, don’t worry. Keep marching.’ We may not be the best musicians, but we’ll be the best musicians we can be that day, for our president.”
590 2009-01-18 The lesson to be learned in the investment-management world is that we should fear C.P.A. auditors bearing opinions. We hope that C.P.A. auditors will be incentivized to straighten up and fly right, and soon.

Charles Mackay’s 19th-century book “Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,” recounting John Law’s Mississippi Scheme, the South Sea Bubble, Tulipomania and others, was reissued in 1932 (for obvious reasons). In a foreword, Bernard Baruch wrote: “All economic movements, by their very nature, are motivated by crowd psychology. . . . I never see a brilliant economic thesis expounding, as though they were geometrical theorems, the mathematics of price movements, that I do not recall Schiller’s dictum: ‘Anyone taken as an individual, is tolerably sensible and reasonable — as a member of a crowd he at once becomes a blockhead.’ ” Baruch speaks of “crowd madness” and says that “these are phenomena of mass action under impulsions and controls which no science has explored.” Sir Isaac Newton, who lost a life’s savings in one of these bubbles, wrote, “I can calculate the movements of the heavenly bodies, but I cannot calculate the madness of men.” Einstein said Newton was the greatest scientific mind who ever lived, so if he couldn’t do it, who can?

Joe Nocera writes that Nassim Taleb (whom I have known and respected for several years) is “impossible to argue with” on Value at Risk measurements because he curtly dismisses the counterarguments offered by “experts” like Gregg Berman of RiskMetrics and Aaron Brown of the hedge fund AQR. But their arguments are so transparently self-serving they fully deserve Nassim’s scorn: “If you say that all risk is unknowable,” Berman says, “you don’t have the basis of any sort of a bet or a trade,” while Brown notes that “to not use VaR is to say that I won’t care about the 99 percent [of the time that it works], in which case you won’t have a business.”

While I completely understand why these folks might decide that making bets that pay them millions of dollars 99 percent of the time and lead to a complete meltdown of the financial system 1 percent of the time makes for an excellent business, this attitude looks a lot less appealing to the taxpayers who have forked over billions to keep the bankers solvent. People who defend Value at Risk measures as necessary for making gambles with other people’s money aren’t just intellectual charlatans; they’re aiding and abetting deeply antisocial behavior.

Joe Nocera properly placed the blame for the financial crisis on the lack of management oversight and diligence rather than on improper calculation and reliance on risk measures. Management, however, has yet to develop the methodologies and systems to systematically bridge the profit-and-performance focus of shareholder-driven financial institutions, to the calculation of Value at Risk and its use in establishing a risk-adjusted-performance-measurement culture. The current financial crisis can be linked to risk exposures that went unmeasured and escalated to life-threatening amounts without finding expression in contemporary accounting and risk-reporting systems. The typical controls — the retrospective auditing of firms once per year, or reviewing internal controls at a point in time, or even calculating a daily worst-case-scenario 99 percent of the time as is the VaR measurement — were never up to the task of monitoring risk exposure as it accumulates in real time.

Risk managers have been focused for too long on past losses as a means of calculating future risk exposures. This retrospective focus has also allowed too many mathematical models to evolve from the marketplace of ideas into mass-marketed products. It is apparent that regulators and the boards of financial firms do not have any systematic way to oversee the accumulating risk exposure, nor have they controlled the incentive compensation systems that drive the sales of risky financially engineered products. They have forgone the challenge of adapting operating metrics to risk-exposure measures as a predictor of potential future losses. Such metrics are perhaps a more useful way of establishing risk-adjusted measurement systems as well as reporting to the companies’ boards on a continuing basis.

Financial institutions must now come to terms with the fact that when transactions enter their operating environments, they trigger risk exposures that can go well beyond nominal transaction values. There is yet another bridge to be built between the methods of risk managers and the performance-measurement tools of finance. The VaR methods and systems were the first step in this process; much more is yet to be done.
591 2009-01-18 And as I learned from the British couple as I walked by their igloo as they prepared for bed, if people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones, people spending the night in glass igloos shouldn’t get undressed with the lights on. The curtains that wrap around the interior, and stop just a few inches above the beds, only give the perception of privacy.

On the night the Britons and I shared igloo hill, conditions were perfect to see the northern lights. I have always wanted to experience the lights, but this was my first attempt. Unfortunately, viewing them is a cold-weather pursuit. While I was there in Lapland, it was about 15 degrees during the day. I married a woman from Miami who shivers anywhere north of St. Augustine, and hunting the lights has never been on our agenda. If I wanted to see them, she made clear, they would have to either inch south or I’d have to go alone. So I invited Chuck, my oldest friend and godfather to one of my sons.

Even with perfect viewing conditions, the lights are notoriously hit or miss. The other problem is staying awake. You can’t keep the igloo’s lights on because then you can’t see out the ceiling. That means you can’t read, either. All you can do is lie in bed, stare at the sky and force yourself to stay awake. That’s difficult after a day of skiing or dog sledding, both available through the hotel. On one night, Chuck lasted until midnight, and I was asleep an hour later.

The next night, as Chuck and I made our way to our igloo, we bumped into the two hotel employees who had been dispatched to rescue the lost British couple. One of the them pointed up to the one cloud in the sky. “See that,” she said. “That’s the beginning of the northern lights. They often start off as a little cloud.”

So Chuck and I hurried up igloo hill to get into place, but once we were up there, away from the lights of the hotel, we were able to see the full glory of the sky. The stars were the show. The sky was ablaze with stars as if each one were on a pull chain. We didn’t even go inside the igloo at first. We just stood outside, our cheeks numb from the cold, and stared at the sky. That sure looked like the Big Dipper right above our heads. It was like the ceiling of Grand Central Terminal, but seemed even closer. It was the most amazing light show I had ever seen, and that was before the shooting stars began.

We figured this had to be our night for the lights. With the help of some silly video games on my iPod, I was able to stay awake until 2:30 a.m., but the only northern lights I saw were the occasional taillights from the cars receding in that direction on the nearby Arctic Sea road.

At breakfast, the employee we had bumped into on the hill asked, “So, did you see the lights?”

“You’re kidding,” she said. “When I got home at 11, they appeared above my house. But it was only for a minute. You didn’t see them?”

I think that at 11 p.m. I was looking north at the Big Dipper, not south toward her house. I had been distracted by a nature show on a different channel. Before Chuck and I left, Sonja Eiramo, the owner’s daughter who helps run the hotel, said she was sorry we had not seen the lights.

“You see, they are very unpredictable,” she said. “They were very active in late August, though.”

I would like to return and try again. In August it can hit 50 degrees in Lapland. Maybe that will be warm enough to bring along my wife.

616 2009-01-19 “I want to see if we can bring those two Washington, D.C.’s together.”

Mr. Obama’s inauguration might offer the nation a new turn, and from that the congregations draw hope. But race’s complications are many, and as these members are reminded daily, they often find themselves speaking from starkly different wells of understanding. The inaugural suggests a nation that, even in unity, experiences history from separate racial vantage points. Once, these two churches were one. In 1829, the white members of Ebenezer Methodist Church cast out their black brethren: You tap your feet too insistently, they said, and sing too loudly. So the blacks walked around the corner and founded Little Ebenezer Church.

Each Ebenezer thrived. Middle-class whites drawn by a prosperous capital crowded into their church, and 1,200 blacks filled the other, the balconies creaking beneath the weight of worshipers. The white Ebenezer — known today as Capitol Hill United Methodist — now has about 150 members, mostly liberal young people who work on the Hill. At Ebenezer, about 60 elderly blacks attend services; its funerals greatly outnumber weddings.

A few years back, the bishop of the Baltimore-Washington Conference of the United Methodist Church ordered these churches, sundered by the sin of racism, to reconcile. Congregants broached tender questions of race, and this weekend they joined as a youth group from Maryland spread its sleeping bags at Ebenezer while Capitol Hill volunteers fed and cared for them.

“Our bishop called upon us to offer radical hospitality, and we want to reflect both our history and the change,” said the Rev. John M. Blanchard Jr., 65, the pastor at Ebenezer. “There is a providential nature to the fact that it is Obama.”

The churches — Capitol Hill United was rebuilt on its original site in 1964, and Ebenezer is a cavernous late-19th-century church with luminous stained glass windows — sit on a well-heeled block on Capitol Hill, a place of brick row houses with wrought iron fences.

It is a liberal bastion; several homeowners are civil rights veterans, and their eyes welled with tears as they watched on election night.

Divisions persist. Race in America offers no fairy tales. “Our congregations have existed almost back to back on the same block for well over a century, and we still struggle to talk,” said Dottie Yunger, a divinity student who has worked with the congregations. “Reverend Martin Luther King was right: the most segregated hour is 11 on Sunday, especially on Capitol Hill.”

On the morning after election night, Ms. Lasater ran into a bleary-eyed Mr. Blanchard on Southeast Fourth Street. “It’s a very good day,” she said by way of greeting. He grinned and replied, “It is such a good day.”

At Capitol Hill United, many labored long hours for Mr. Obama and most voted for him, and their relief was great. The age of Bush was nearly gone. The environment, the Iraq war, civil liberties: so much would be different.

“I was very moved that my child would come into the world and know only a black president,” said Abbey Levenshus, a member of Capitol Hill United who is pregnant. “But there’s no doubt we experienced it very differently from Ebenezer.”

At Ebenezer, age tempered the temptation to volunteer. But Mr. Obama’s victory plumbed their emotional depths. The congregation came of age in a Washington legally segregated by race. Lucy K. Brown, 90, recalls walking 20 blocks to a black public school rather than across the street to the white one; Jack Green, 75, recalls the police chasing him out of whites-only swimming pools.

Mr. Green, a dapper retired police officer, stood guard along Dwight D. Eisenhower’s inaugural parade route in 1953 and listened as the white District of Columbia police band played “Dixie,” about a freed slave longing for the plantation.

Did he believe he would ever see a black president? Like everyone in his congregation who was asked this question, he wagged his head.

“Never,” he said. “I still will not until I see him put his hand on that Bible. Then I will believe.”

To wander into Ebenezer on a Sunday is to find family gone gray. As a child, Mr. Green took Bible instruction from Mrs. Brown, who remains petite in a purple dress with auburn locks swept up in a bun. White-haired members sit in pews that have borne family nameplates for more than a hundred years. On one day in 1913, Ebenezer raised $6,000 and paid off the mortgage; a photo shows smiling churchgoers burning their deed.

By the time the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the March on Washington, so many whites had fled Capitol Hill that the blocks around Ebenezer became more brown than not. That river reversed course 15 years ago as real estate prices surged. For years, racially restrictive lending practices made it difficult for blacks to buy homes on Capitol Hill; now rising rents are forcing them out. (Washington’s black population has dipped to 57 percent from 70 percent in 1970.)

Mr. Blanchard worries that the end for his church beckons. “We are in danger of becoming a museum,” he said.

Capitol Hill United charted an inverse arc. As Ebenezer surged, Capitol Hill’s white members — F.B.I. agents, mint workers, police officers — moved to the suburbs. Now its congregation is growing. One young dynamic woman has followed another as minister, having an effect not unlike defibrillators clamped to the church’s heart.

The congregation regards talk of partisan politics as plague. “We try not to ask who you work for,” Ms. Levenshus said. “Although one member said it was much easier to come out as a gay man than as a Republican.”

In 2005, after years of prayer and passionate debate, it became a “reconciling congregation,” which is to say it openly welcomes gay men and lesbians and favors gay ordination. A few older members walked out.

The congregants heeded the call to reconcile with their black neighbors. “I’ll say this for both congregations,” Ms. Lasater said. “It took courage to ask why there are two Methodist churches, one black and one white, on the same block in 2008.”

So many slights accumulated. In the early 1960s, the Capitol Hill United pastor invited his Ebenezer counterpart, who held a doctorate of divinity, to deliver a guest sermon. On Saturday night, the pastor rescinded his offer.

“As a 10-year-old, I thought it was horrible,” said Joan Askew, an Ebenezer member and the daughter of that black pastor. “But as I saw what racism was about, well, I see it now as a time and place.”

A year ago, 25 whites from Capitol Hill United showed up to meet with 7 Ebenezer blacks. Well-intentioned talk became a web. The whites are can-do, let’s-move-the-agenda-forward. Ebenezer members listened.

“We struggle with cultural communication,” Mr. Blanchard said. “They are younger, and they are so eager to make up for history that they talk a lot. I remind them that just because I don’t say anything doesn’t mean I agree with you.”

Ebenezer congregants sound less worried about apologies for ancient slights. Their fear is that the bishop will merge the congregations and sell their church (the bishop has never mentioned merging). And the gay policy disquieted some. A shared prayer service grew tense when an Ebenezer member bowed her head and said that homosexuality ran counter to God’s will. Capitol Hill members stood and prayed that God might open her eyes.

“The lifestyles of some of their young people are very different,” Mrs. Brown said. “But they have choirs and reach out to the less fortunate. We learn.”

Mr. Blanchard challenged his elderly congregation to cast eyes outward. “Why don’t we have homeless men sleeping on our porch as does Capitol Hill?” he said. “Why are they so good at welcoming the stranger into their midst? I’d love to have some of their vitality.”

Where this ends is not clear; the churches cherish their separate identities. The question still unanswered in light of the inauguration of a president half-black and half-white is whether these fractured congregations might yet make each other whole.

“Reconciliation is jagged and messy, but racism is a sin against the body of Christ,” Ms. Lasater said. “We are broken when we are separate.”
617 2009-01-19 MILAN — Is there a Fresh Kills landfill for industrial clichés? If so, call the haulers and have them collect the term "brand DNA.” You hear the phrase a lot lately, not least when it comes to fashion, as bean counters grapple with ways to stimulate slack markets in an economy that has never been worse since the earth cooled.

Mapping a fashion label’s genome is not the same as falling back on the safety of formula; two shows at the start of the mens wear fashion week here made it clear how hard it can be to tell the two ambitions apart.

On Saturday, at Burberry Prorsum, Christopher Bailey showed a collection he characterized with the oxymoron "modern nostalgia,” which made reference to the austerity of post-war England as captured in images by the photographer Bill Brandt.

The ludicrousness of conjuring up union roughnecks and stevedores in designer garb was luckily offset by Mr. Bailey’s assured deployment of boxy shapes (coats, mostly, with outsized collars) and sexy narrow trousers, accessorized with newsboy caps and rubber-soled boots.

The detailing was generally subtle (the grim twee-ness of Fair Isle knits leavened by blurring and fading the patterns or rendering them in patchwork) and occasionally inane (velvet suits and rumpled cotton shirts with Wild Bill Hickock ties at the throat). What really signified as tough was the designer’s intention to reclaim the label’s trademark black, tan and red plaid, which has become a proxy logo for the brand over the years since Burberry was transformed from a fusty raincoat maker to a favorite of investors and people who wish to resemble Agnyess Deyn.

In the past, Mr. Bailey has used the signature plaid sparingly, in part to distance his designs from the counterfeiters whose appropriations made the brand so popular with Canal Street touts. Now it’s clear that Burberry is ready to reclaim its brand-genetic heritage, and thus there was an abundance of scarves for licensed merchants to hawk until the money starts flowing and Mr. Bailey can indulge his less commercial instincts again.
618 2009-01-19 In front of her, Mr. Springsteen was singing “The Rising,” the song he wrote after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that pays homage to the firefighters who lost their lives as they climbed the stairs of the burning Twin Towers.

Mrs. Ross had never seen Mr. Springsteen in concert. In fact, the last concert she went to was by the Manhattans in Atlanta in 2001.

And yet, there she was, along with three girlfriends — all in floor-length minks — huddled in the cold, tapping their feet to the beat. Four middle-age, African-American women, talking about the Selma-to-Montgomery march in 1965, about Dr. King, about the civil rights movement — and listening to Bruce.

“I’m so out of my comfort zone out here in the cold,” said Delphine Straughn-Tupper, one of Mrs. Ross’s friends. “But there was no way I was going to miss this.”

For Mr. Obama and his aides, finding a way to temper and manage all that emotion and optimism may be their biggest challenge in the next three days. The incoming White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was on “Fox News Sunday” trying to remind everyone that the country will still be in a recession on Jan. 21.

“We did not get into the situation overnight,” Mr. Gibbs said. “The problems and the challenges that our country face didn’t happen all last week. It’s going to take us some time.”

Aides said that Mr. Obama’s inauguration speech would touch on individual responsibility, and would urge Americans to prepare for hard times ahead. Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told NBC that the speech would declare an end to “the culture of anything goes” and demand a new era of responsibility from government, corporations and Americans in general.

Once he takes office, Mr. Obama will call in his top military commanders and ask them to figure out a withdrawal plan for Iraq, and will pledge more American troops to Afghanistan, his aides said. In Iraq, “we’re in an area where everyone agrees that we should be on a path to withdrawing those troops,” his senior adviser, David Axelrod, told “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” on ABC.

Mr. Obama may also issue executive orders in his first week that call for the closing of the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, though the process may take time, Mr. Gibbs said.

But on the Mall on Sunday, few people were talking about Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantánamo or responsibility. Instead, they were talking about history.

“We’ve been up since 6 a.m.,” said Sarah Scheffer, 18, of Rumson, N.J., who showed up before the gates opened with a dozen other freshmen from American University to secure a spot close to the stage. “It’s going to be a long day, but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”

People perched in the trees around the Lincoln Memorial and even sat on top of the portable toilets to get glimpses of the stage. Fire trucks parked on closed-off 17th Street in front of the World War II monument, but firefighters were not engaged in fire control. Instead, they stood on top of their trucks as people crowded around them, handing up digital cameras and begging them to take photographs of them in front of the crowds. The firefighters obliged, although one could be heard, grumbling, “O.K., we’ve got to wrap this up now.”

The temperature was 28 degrees, but wave after wave of people kept coming, cramming closer to Lincoln’s seated statue.

For his part, Mr. Obama, who started his day by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery and trying out a potential new church for his family, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in northwest Washington, appeared to enjoy the concert. When Mr. Springsteen and the folk singer Pete Seeger led a raucous foot-stomping version of “This Land Is Your Land,” Mr. Obama sang along with everyone else.

From the stage, Denzel Washington and Jamie Foxx appeared, almost in a competition for the role of Mr. Obama when Hollywood tries its first take on the 44th president.

Mr. Washington went first, striding confidently on stage — to the attendant shrieks from women in the audience — and delivering a speech that sounded like one of Mr. Obama’s, complete with references to the legacies of Lincoln and other forefathers.

But then came Mr. Foxx, who did Mr. Washington one better. “Change has come,” Mr. Foxx intoned, in a drop-dead impersonation of Mr. Obama’s speech election night in Grant Park in Chicago. In front of him, a delighted-looking Mr. Obama was grinning.
619 2009-01-19 MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — After struggling in her first match at the Australian Open since losing last year’s final, Ana Ivanovic finished with a flourish in a 7-5, 6-3 victory against Julia Goerges on Monday.

Ivanovic, seeded fifth, was broken once in each set but fended off five other break points before finishing with consecutive aces against Goerges, a German ranked No. 107 and playing in only her fourth major.

Ivanovic lost the 2008 Australian final to Maria Sharapova, who is out because of an injury, and then won the French Open to move into the No. 1 ranking midway through the year.

But Ivanovic, a 21-year-old Serb, was bothered by injuries in the middle of the season, and her form at the majors waned. She lost in the third round at Wimbledon and in the second round at the United States Open.

She and Goerges finished with a combined 66 unforced errors to 34 winners and were called for several foot faults. Ivanovic was pleased to have escaped.
620 2009-01-19 CHICAGO  From a dismal parking lot on this city’s South Side, a bus is scheduled to pull out on Monday headed east, packed with people from the neighborhoods where President-elect Barack Obama first cut his teeth as an organizer hoping to make a difference in the world.

The riders on the Fellowship Bus, as they are calling it, are making a bare-bones 1,200-mile round trip to Washington to be present as Mr. Obama takes the oath of office. They are leaving without hotel reservations, an agenda of any kind or even much of a chance that they will get close enough to the Capitol to see the main event. Nor will they get much sleep, as the bus will turn around as soon as the inauguration is over.

But none of that matters much.

“We just had to be there for him,” said the Rev. David Bigsby, a Baptist preacher who has a seat on the bus. “He was such a blessing to our community and churches.”

The Rev. Len Dubi, a Roman Catholic priest who will also be on board, is already reminiscing about how he watched over Mr. Obama as a young community organizer trainee in the mid-1980s.

Yvonne Brookens, a retired phone company coin counter, is thinking about taking the cap Mr. Obama gave her while shaking hands on her block in his first campaign for state office.

And the Rev. Archie Graham, a former civil rights activist, said he was preparing to be overcome by the timing of it all, setting off to see the inauguration of the first black person to be elected president on nothing less than the Martin Luther King holiday.

Mr. Bigsby, whose memories of Mr. Obama include an appearance at his church in Mr. Obama’s first campaign for office, said: “It’s spine-chilling. Words cannot describe this feeling. To think what Dr. King would say.”

Of the millions of political pilgrims traveling from all corners of the country and, no doubt, the world, aching to get a glimpse of Mr. Obama’s inauguration, the people on the Fellowship Bus may be singular in the humble nature of their roots and the richness of their decades-old connection to the new president.

They are social justice advocates, members of the clergy, retired government workers, former civil rights leaders from the 1960s and younger idealists. They never left their neighborhoods. These days, they glow with something near paternal pride.

“We’re feeling that it’s our victory,” Mr. Dubi said. “It’s a very emotional experience.”

The bus riders are making the journey on a shoestring budget of $150 per person, as some of their simple lifestyles have not changed much since a young Mr. Obama pounded the pavement.

It was on their streets and in their churches where Mr. Obama, according to his memoir, said he took his first “awkward steps toward manhood.”

Mr. Obama arrived in Chicago in his 20s after growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He worked as a community organizer on the South Side for three years, roughly from 1983 to 1986, then left to attend Harvard Law School.

“Change won’t come from the top, I would say,” Mr. Obama wrote in the memoir “Dreams From My Father.” “Change will come from a mobilized grass roots.”

On the streets, Mr. Dubi, 66, and others said they remembered that “he proved himself.”

“One of the remarkable things I’ve learned from him, just observing him,” Mr. Dubi said, “is that you can’t move forward in a democracy without bringing in people who are opposed to you. I saw that in him. I just liked his friendliness, his approachability.”

After receiving a law degree, Mr. Obama returned to Chicago. He ran a voter registration drive, joined a law firm, taught constitutional law and was elected to the State Senate in 1996.

While he remained on the South Side, his world moved to Hyde Park  and to Trinity United Church of Christ  and was more rarefied than what he knew during his organizing days farther south. Hyde Park also became his base for a successful run for the United States Senate in 2004, and it remained his local stomping ground until he moved to Washington just days ago.

But the people in the more humble communities and smaller churches where he organized never forgot him, and they say he never forgot them either, in that many of their goals remain his, too  better education, housing and jobs for everyone.

“We’re all just community activists,” said Mr. Bigsby, 63. “We don’t need to engage him for a little trip or something of a selfish nature. What we’d rather is for him to focus on the collective needs of our community. And he’s said he believes in that, that change comes up from the people.”

The 55-seat Fellowship Bus will roll overnight to cut out the cost of accommodations, and passengers are packing food to save money. They will entertain themselves with hymns and stories about their old friend, “that lovely young man,” as Ms. Brookens put it, referring to Mr. Obama.

Even the $150 fare was a stretch for some. Ms. Brookens, 62, paid in installments.
621 2009-01-19 Fred I. Greenstein, emeritus professor of politics at Princeton, said: “I don’t think there is a precedent for this. Sometimes there is bad blood, sometimes there is so-so blood, but rarely is there good blood.”

It is “trademark Obama,” Professor Greenstein said, noting that Mr. Obama’s impulse to win over even ideological opposites appeared to date at least to his friendships with conservatives on The Harvard Law Review when he was president.

For Mr. Obama, cooperation with his defeated opponent could also provide a useful ally in the Senate, where Mr. McCain has parlayed his national popularity and go-his-own-way reputation into a role as a pivotal dealmaker over the last eight years. But on the subject of Iraq, in particular, their collaboration could also raise questions among Mr. Obama’s liberal supporters, many of whom demonized Mr. McCain as a dangerous warmonger because of his staunch opposition to a pullout.

Mr. Obama arrived for their Chicago meeting on Nov. 16 with several well-researched proposals to collaborate on involving some of Mr. McCain’s favorite causes, including a commission to cut “corporate welfare,” curbing waste in military procurement and an overhaul of immigration rules.

“The corporate welfare commission and military acquisition reform are two things the president-elect wants to do very soon,” Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff and a participant in the meeting, said in an interview. The new administration is already preparing to introduce legislation echoing a previous McCain bill on the commission idea, Mr. Emanuel said, adding, “We have been very respectful and solicitous of his ideas.”

Mr. Emanuel said he did not remember any discussion of Iraq. “Barack has been clear that he is going to stick to his responsible reduction in forces, and he hasn’t changed from that,” he said.

But Mr. Graham, who accompanied Mr. McCain to the meeting, said Mr. Obama took a notably different tone toward Iraq than he had during the campaign, emphasizing the common ground in their views.

“He said that he understands that we had differences but he wanted to let us know that he also understands that we have got to be responsible in how we leave Iraq,” Mr. Graham recalled. “What the Obama-Biden administration has talked about is not losing the gains we have achieved. ”

He added, “Obama does not want to be the guy who lost Iraq when it is close to being won.”

Mr. Emanuel, whose only previous contact with Mr. Graham was negotiating the terms of the presidential debates, began calling him more than once a week to follow up. “Constantly,” Mr. Emanuel said. “There has been a running dialogue.”

Mr. Graham, in turn, called his counterpart “a pleasure to do business with.”

Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., a friend since Mr. McCain was the Navy’s liaison to the Senate three decades ago, has also played intermediary. He called Mr. McCain to ask him to appear at the inaugural dinner, and he invited Mr. Graham on another recent trip to Iraq and Afghanistan.

“I know the vice president-elect is very concerned about the end game in Iraq,” Mr. Graham said.

Some Senate Democrats have complained that Mr. Obama failed to seek their contributions about certain appointments — notably Leon E. Panetta as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. But the Obama transition team has consistently sought advice and feedback from Mr. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, on national security appointments, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Graham both said.

Mr. Graham said Mr. McCain had enthusiastically supported those appointments: Gen. James L. Jones (an old McCain friend) as national security adviser; Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the retired Army chief of staff, as secretary of veterans affairs; Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state; and most of all, retaining Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates.

“Picking Gates is a good statement that they are not going to pull out of Iraq in a way that undercuts the gains achieved,” Mr. Graham said.

And when Mr. McCain raised “concerns” about the potential choice of Adm. Dennis C. Blair as director of national intelligence, Mr. Emanuel said, Mr. Obama’s advisers asked the admiral to provide answers to Mr. McCain’s questions to win his support. (Neither side would disclose the details of Mr. McCain’s concerns, but Admiral Blair has faced past questions about his relations with the military dictators of Indonesia when he was in the Navy, and a possible conflict of interest when he later worked with a nonprofit group evaluating weapons systems.)

“We gave McCain time to talk through it, made sure he was briefed,” Mr. Emanuel said.

Mr. Obama’s cultivation of Mr. McCain is a stark contrast with the practices of past presidents. After the 2004 election, President Bush did not talk to his defeated opponent, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, until Mr. Kerry visited the White House in March 2005 as part of a large group to celebrate the Red Sox victory in the World Series. (“I like to see Senator Kerry,” Mr. Bush said, “except when we’re fixing to debate.”) And after Mr. Bush defeated Mr. McCain for the Republican nomination in 2000, the two had only perfunctory contact and often-adversarial relations for nearly two years.

Shortly before his second inauguration, former President Bill Clinton awarded his defeated opponent, Bob Dole, the Medal of Freedom. But it was an entirely ceremonial event. (Mr. Dole joked that had hoped to be at the White House picking up “the front door key” instead.)

A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain did not respond to several messages. But Mr. Graham said he and Mr. McCain were convinced that Mr. Obama was genuinely interested in working together with them on both domestic priorities and foreign policy.

“Not only is it good politics,” Mr. Graham said, “it gives you an insight into who we are dealing with.”
622 2009-01-19 The F.B.I. and securities regulators have joined the investigation of Arthur Nadel, a Florida hedge fund manager who disappeared four days ago, leaving clients concerned that they might have lost as much as $350 million.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission are helping on the case, police Lt. Stanley Beishline of Sarasota, Fla., said in a telephone interview.

One of Mr. Nadel’s business partners, Neil Moody, said Mr. Nadel had spoken to his wife, Peg, since he was reported missing. Mr. Nadel, 76, is president of Scoop Management in Sarasota, which oversees funds that include Valhalla Investment Partners. Mr. Moody holds no position in Scoop Management and was a partner with Mr. Nadel only on the Vahalla fund and two Viking funds.

Scoop’s claim to have managed as much as $350 million “may be high because performance results were exaggerated,” Mr. Moody said in an interview. Mr. Moody said he did not know anything was wrong until Mr. Nadel was reported missing.

Mr. Nadel was last seen by his wife at 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday when he left for work, said Lt. Chuck Lesaltato of the Sarasota County sheriff’s office.

Calls to Mrs. Nadel’s home or cellphone were not answered.

The Herald-Tribune in Sarasota described Mr. Nadel as a “prominent player in Sarasota social and philanthropic circles.”
623 2009-01-19 For those coming to pay homage to the BlackBerry-toting president, the inauguration has the potential to be a wireless Woodstock. If, that is, the networks can handle it.

“If some of these estimates come true, people should anticipate delays with regards to sending text messages or making phone calls or getting onto the Internet,” said Joe Farren, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, an industry trade group. It has asked people to send texts rather than make phone calls (text uses less bandwidth than speech) and to send photos only after the event.

“We can only bend the laws of physics so much,” Mr. Farren said.

To limit problems, the carriers are adding radios to the cell towers to pick up more signals and adding landlines to carry those signals from the towers to network centers. They are bringing in trucks costing hundreds of thousands of dollars that can transmit signals, some of which also have on-board generators in case of a power failure.

But some consumers and consumer advocates say the industry should not be patting itself on the back for its efforts; rather, it should be apologizing for charging consumers for a service that does not always work.

Gene Kimmelman, vice president for international affairs for the Consumers Union, the nonprofit that publishes Consumer Reports, said people in Washington may not get seamless service, but they will invariably get a bill at the end of the month.

“It’s like paying for an all-you-can-eat buffet and discovering there are only scraps left,” Mr. Kimmelman said. He suggested another way the carriers might spend their millions of dollars: “Maybe they should offer a rebate if they cut usage on Inauguration Day.”

The inauguration, he said, “is indicative of a common problem that consumers are getting charged for a quality of service that isn’t being delivered.”

Cellphone service, while spotty at times, has certainly improved in recent years. The challenges are acute at major events, which push demand past what the networks are intended to process and transmit. But many such events have predictable crowd sizes, enabling the carriers to beef up capacity.

“We know how many people can pack into a race track or concert,” said John Johnson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. Given the enthusiastic crowds that Barack Obama has drawn throughout his campaign, Verizon cannot easily predict the call volume on Tuesday. “It’s unprecedented,” said Mr. Johnson.

Verizon has several mobile units in its reserve known by their animalistic acronyms: COWs and COLTs (for cells on wheels and cells on light trucks).

These trucks cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But carriers also have “sat COLTs,” which carry satellite dishes to send signals independent of terrestrial networks and power supplies.

“You drive it where it needs to go, park it, push a couple of buttons, the mast will deploy, the dish will deploy and our generator and satellite ensures we’re fully self-contained and independent,” said Tanya Lin, manager of emergency response team operations for Sprint. The company is bringing in two such trucks, in part to be prepared for any emergency that could compromise the usual infrastructure.

Sprint Nextel, which said it had been planning for the inauguration since April, has also increased capacity of its cell sites and terrestrial transmission lines to prepare the network to sustain 10 to 15 times the number of users it would serve on its networks during a normal day.

The company is increasing coverage not just in the city, but also along the route that brought the Obama and Biden families from Philadelphia to Washington on a whistle-stop train tour.

AT&T Mobility said it was spending $4 million to upgrade its networks. The company said that along the parade route, it was adding 80 percent to the capacity of its 3G network, its much-maligned high-speed data network; the company is improving its slower 2G network by 69 percent and increasing staff by 60 percent. It has increased coverage at 11 major hotels. And it has two satellite COLTs and two reserve satellite COLTs.

Social networks are also expecting a spike in traffic to their sites as inauguration attendees upload snapshots to Web sites like Facebook and Flickr and write to one another throughout the event.

Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, said the company was hoping to sidestep network hiccups. He is not expecting the same traffic spikes as during the election, when the site was flooded with 10 times the normal traffic, but says the service “will nevertheless be doubling our through-put capacity before Tuesday.”

Indeed, for some incessant communicators — the members of Generation Twitter — experiences seem complete only if they are shared via mobile device, said James E. Katz, the director of the Center for Mobile Communication Studies at Rutgers. The devices also let attendees show off their presence to those not able to be there in person.

He said that the carriers who were asking people to communicate judiciously were fighting “human nature in two ways.”

“One is asking people to postpone the instant gratification,” he said. The other is that the attendees who respect the request to text and not talk, or forgo sending photos, will be frustrated if they see others in the crowd indulging.

“This is a great opportunity,” he said, “for the cellphone companies to show they are reliable companies that do get calls through.”
624 2009-01-19 One thing magazine advertising and hip-hop music have always had in common is skin — images of models, usually women, in alluring poses and various states of undress. The Source, the hip-hop magazine, does not aim to do away with such images — there is a lot of money in them — but it wants to make the sex in its pages a lot less explicit.

To that end, the magazine announced recently that it would no longer take what the co-publisher, L. Londell McMillan, calls “booty ads,” for pornographic films, pornographic Web sites or escort services. But those have been a mainstay for The Source — more than half the ads in the magazine at times, he said.

The Source hopes to gain more than it loses by chasing mainstream advertisers that do not want their ads alongside the adults-only kind. That’s a serious gamble at a time when magazines are struggling, unable to hold onto the ads they have.

“I realize the risk that we’re taking,” said Mr. McMillan, 42, a partner at a major law firm, Dewey & LeBouef. “But I think when you have the more raunchy, seedy ads, you lose ads like financial services ads, some of the travel ads, the bigger corporate consumer ads like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, technology, high fashion.”

The Source, he said, should be able to appeal to the core hip-hop audience, mostly young men, while also being something “you wouldn’t mind your kids seeing.”

Founded in the 1980s, The Source became the first major magazine devoted to hip-hop, but in the 1990s, it lost ground to its primary competitor, Vibe. Since then, it has gone through turnovers in management and financial troubles that culminated in bankruptcy.
625 2009-01-19 On Tuesday, her first-round opponent will be Jessica Moore, an 18-year-old Australian, a more fortunate draw than any 6-foot Russians or Americans with the last name Williams.

“Still, it’s going to be challenging,” Christina said. “She’s a local girl, and the fans are going to be behind her all the way.”

A small but stout contingent will be supporting Christina, including her mother; her father, John, who moved the family back to New Jersey in 1998 after working five years in Hong Kong; and Carlos Cano, her New Jersey-based coach. Lauren, a freshman who plays for Princeton, will be following from her dormitory.

As talented as Christina is, not even her closest supporters envisioned this level of success even a year ago, when she was ranked No. 712. In 2007, she showed enough talent to earn an invitation to the United States Tennis Association’s high-performance youth training facility in Boca Raton, but her first year there was marked by inconsistent results.

Last September, everything changed. She began making regular visits home to work with Cano and spend more time with her family. Then, in the wake of a third-round loss in the United States Open junior tournament, she had an outstanding fall.

She helped the United States win the Junior Fed Cup in Mexico and reached the final of the prestigious Orange Bowl tournament for girls 18 and under. Christina has vaulted 338 spots in the rankings in less than 13 months, and she now shares a locker room with No. 1 Jelena Jankovic.

“I never expected her to get into a Grand Slam tournament this soon,” John McHale said last week before leaving for Melbourne. “She’s been doing very well lately, but this definitely caught us by surprise.”

It also seems to have surprised a few tournament officials. On her first visit to the grounds in 10 years, Christina checked in at the players’ desk looking for a practice court and a partner.

Margarita said the man behind the counter told her daughter, “You have to go across the street to the public courts” to practice for the qualifying tournament.

Christina informed the man that she was, in fact, in the main draw. In the locker room, another official had to be corrected after directing her to the tiny lockers reserved for those in the qualifying tournament. Shortly thereafter, Christina was on a court with Sania Mirza, India’s top professional, and the best player she had ever hit with.

“It went well,” Christina said. “I kept up some long rallies with her, so that’s encouraging.”

More encouraging is the way she has been hitting the ball over the past five months, since Cano helped her fix a minor flaw in the backswing of her signature forehand, leading to impressive results and soaring confidence.

Christina remains in awe of the pros who have suddenly become her peers. In the players’ cafeteria this weekend, she said, she and her mother sat at a table between Rafael Nadal and Marat Safin on one side and Serena Williams on the other, trying desperately to keep from gawking.

“I still kind of do it,” she said. “I can’t help it. I’m like, ‘Hey, Mom, look who it is.’ ”

All of those players had been there before. So had Christina. But this time, she is sure to remember every detail.
626 2009-01-19 Zach Johnson closed with a five-under-par 65 to win the Sony Open in Honolulu, ending his two-week stay in Hawaii by playing his final six rounds in 30 under.

Johnson, whose 64-67 finish last weekend at the Mercedes-Benz Championship gave him a tie for sixth, outlasted David Toms in a duel along the back nine Sunday, finishing with a two-putt birdie for a two-shot victory over Toms and Adam Scott.

“The worst part of Hawaii is leaving,” Johnson said.

Tadd Fujikawa, an 18-year-old from Honolulu trying to become the youngest winner in PGA Tour history, started the final round two shots out of the lead but never got closer. He struggled to a 73 and tied for 32nd.

Toms had to settle for a strong start to his season. He finished out of the top 125 on the money list last year and is trying to qualify for the big events that for years were part of his schedule.

He kept the pressure on Johnson over the final holes, making a 4-foot birdie on the 15th to pull within a shot and saving par from the bunker on the 17th with a 12-foot putt to stay one shot behind going to the last hole.

But he tried to take too much off the corner of the dogleg at No. 18 and left his ball in a bunker. Then came an aggressive play with a hybrid club that went only about 80 yards into the rough.
627 2009-01-19 Still seething from an overtime defeat in Denver and a narrow home loss to Minnesota, Phoenix Suns forward Amare Stoudemire called Sunday’s game in Toronto a must win. And with the Raptors charging in the fourth quarter, Stoudemire took over.

Stoudemire scored 31 points, Steve Nash had a season-high 18 assists and Phoenix beat Toronto, 117-113, on Sunday afternoon, its ninth consecutive victory over the struggling Raptors.

“After a tough loss to Minnesota, it felt like this was a win we definitely needed,” Stoudemire said.

Jason Richardson added 17 points, Shaquille O’Neal and Matt Barnes each had 16 and Leandro Barbosa scored 14 for Phoenix.

Stoudemire scored 11 points in the fourth as the Suns won the opener of a six-game trip.

“We’re a different team when he plays at that level,” Suns Coach Terry Porter said of Stoudemire. Nash sealed the victory on a driving layup with 12.9 seconds to play and drew rave reviews for his distribution.

HEAT 104, THUNDER 94 Dwyane Wade had 32 points and 10 assists to help Miami earn its fourth victory during a seven-game trip.

Yakhouba Diawara had 14 points after starting in place of the injured Shawn Marion.
628 2009-01-19 Unlike the nation’s banks, hedge funds haven’t been lining up for government bailouts in the wake of losses they can’t handle. But the funds do share one Wall Street problem: a huge mismatch between the short-term funds they take in and the long-term bets they make. Without a rethink of their business models, many in the hedge fund business risk going the way of the investment banking dodo.

Recall the nightmare on Wall Street. Going into 2008, America’s five big investment banks held trillions of dollars in long-term and illiquid assets that were financed largely by short-term borrowings. That did not work out so well. Two of them disappeared. Another was swallowed by a traditional bank, and the last two had to don the sober garb of regulated, deposit-taking banks to survive.

In the hedge fund industry, which at its peak last year managed $2 trillion, the analogous problem runs like this: Investors hand their money over to hedge funds, which typically charge fees of about 2 percent a year and a fifth of any profits, on the basis that they will, mostly, make some money even when pandemonium breaks loose. This promise of what the industry calls absolute return went unmet last year. The average hedge fund lost nearly 20 percent of its value in 2008, according to Hedge Fund Research.

As a result, many investors understandably wanted their money back. The problem is, hedge funds have in many cases loaded up with investments they can’t easily sell — at least not without incurring a big loss. That’s not just bad for the investors who want out. It also creates collateral damage to those who want to stay in the funds.

For funds that want to continue letting investors pull their money out on relatively short notice, one answer is to cut out the adventurous stuff and stick to the most liquid markets, like those for stocks, government bonds and the like. Hedge fund grandee Paul Tudor Jones is doing just that with his BVI Global fund.

Some managers still want to place complex, illiquid bets. For them, the obvious solution is to look for longer-term capital, akin to the way Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are pursuing low-cost, relatively stable deposits.

629 2009-01-19 After a protracted legal battle, the former owners of the Isis Theater, a cinema in Aspen, Colo., have acquired the American rights to the complete works of Ingmar Bergman, right, the Swedish filmmaker who died in 2007, The Rocky Mountain News reported. A district court judge in Colorado ruled last year against the Scandinavian media group Svensk Filmindustri and ordered the transfer of the rights to Isis Litigation to satisfy an unpaid court settlement. The dispute stems from a 1997 agreement between Isis and Svensk to transform the Isis into a multiplex cinema. Svensk guaranteed the lease on the project, but when its partner, Resort Theaters of America, went bankrupt in 2000, Svensk refused to honor the deal. Isis sued at the time and won a judgment of $8.9 million, but Svensk refused to pay. Since then, the rights to the massive catalog have been with Isis, and they have been registered with the United States Copyright Office since late December. Isis has recently unveiled the Web site SwedishClassicFilms.com to make the films available in the United States. The transfer could result in wider distribution of many of Bergman’s films, and Isis may also decide to sell the rights.
630 2009-01-19 On Sunday, David Axelrod, a top adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, said on ABC’s “This Week” program that the second half of the $700 billion TARP fund, to be released after Mr. Obama is in office, must be administered in a way that will get “credit flowing again to businesses and families across the country. That hasn’t happened with the expenditure of the first $350 billion.”

The British initiative would allow banks to identify their worst-performing, subprime-mortgage-related assets, while also keeping the taxpayer’s exposure limited.

The strategy follows a surge of criticism that the plan Mr. Brown devised at the height of the financial crisis has not stimulated bank lending, even as the economy hurtles toward recession. Last week, shares of British banks plummeted on renewed fears that banks worldwide would be hit with larger write-downs, and face the possibility of nationalization.

On Friday, Barclays, which snapped up Lehman’s broker-dealer business a day after the investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection in September, suffered a 25 percent plunge in its stock price on fears of a large write-off.

Some analysts blamed the end of a government-imposed ban against short-sales for the stock’s decline.

In response to the plunge, Barclays said in a statement that its board “knows no justification for the fall in the share price.” It said it would announce results for 2008 on Feb. 17, and expected “to report profit before tax for the year, after reflecting all costs, impairment and market valuations, well ahead of the £5.3 billion consensus estimate of sell-side analysts.”

Last fall, Barclays refused government funds that came with restrictions on dividends and compensation. In November, angry shareholders lashed out at directors for planning to raise $10.5 billion — mostly from Middle Eastern investors — and dilute existing shares.

HSBC, another British banking powerhouse, has also been buffeted by concern about its financial health, even though it was widely believed to have escaped the worst of the financial crisis.

Its stock slid last week after a Morgan Stanley report said HSBC would have to raise as much as $30 billion in new capital and cut its dividend because of the worsening economic climate and its thin capital base. HSBC maintains that its capital position is strong. It declined to comment on whether it needed to raise more money.

While Barclays and HSBC may have attracted the attention of short-sellers, weaker banks expecting huge losses, like the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, are expected to make the most use of the government’s new insurance plan.

Analysts expect it to cover over £100 billion in distressed assets and to include a swap program that would raise the government’s stake in banks like Royal Bank of Scotland, while decreasing the high interest rates that banks are now paying on their preferred government-held shares. The government already owns close to 60 percent of Royal Bank of Scotland, and could increase that stake under the new initiative.

Britain’s Conservative opposition has scored points against Mr. Brown’s Labor Party with rising criticism that Mr. Brown’s original bank plan was inadequate. With a 2010 deadline for a general election, the extent to which Mr. Brown’s latest bank plan is perceived as successful could have a significant effect on his political fortunes.

with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum, 

with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice.

658 2009-01-20 These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land; a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.

Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real, they are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this America: They will be met.

On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.

On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.

We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.

In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.

It has not been the path for the faint-hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.

Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor -- who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.

For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.

For us, they fought and died in places Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sanh.

Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.

This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed.

Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.

For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.

The state of our economy calls for action: bold and swift. And we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth.

We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.

We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality...

We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.

All this we can do. All this we will do.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.

What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long, no longer apply.

MR. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.

Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.

And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account, to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.

Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.

But this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.

The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.

As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.

Our founding fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.

Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.

And so, to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.

Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.

They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. Our security emanates from the justness of our cause; the force of our example; the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.

We are the keepers of this legacy, guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We'll begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard- earned peace in Afghanistan.

With old friends and former foes, we'll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.

We will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense.

And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that, "Our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."

For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.

We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and nonbelievers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.

And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.

To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.

To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.

To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.

To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.

And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.

As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.

We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service: a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.

And yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.

For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.

It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break; the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.

It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.

Our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them may be new, but those values upon which our success depends, honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old.

These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.

What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task.

This is the price and the promise of citizenship.

This is the source of our confidence: the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.

This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall. And why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.

So let us mark this day in remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled.

In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.

The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood.

At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:

"Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it."

America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words; with hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come; let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.

Thank you. God bless you.

And God bless the United States of America.

The first defendant will be Kaing Guek Eav, 65, left, known as Duch, who commanded the Tuol Sleng torture house, where at least 14,000 people were killed or sent to a killing field for execution. He is charged with an array of crimes, including murder, torture, rape and political persecution. Cases are still being prepared against the other four defendants, all in custody. Thirty years after the Khmer Rouge were ousted in a Vietnamese invasion, no Khmer Rouge leader has ever been brought to a court to face judgment.
673 2009-01-20 Prime Minister Gordon Brown made similar noises on Monday, when he outlined a new £100 billion plan in which the government wrests a promise from banks to raise lending in exchange for having the taxpayer limit the banks’ losses from troubled assets.

But let’s stop for a moment. This has been a popular — and populist — view that has emerged over recent months: those greedy bankers are hoarding our tax dollars instead of lending the money the way they were supposed to do. And it needs to stop.

This view, however, may be misplaced. As Citigroup and Bank of America have sadly demonstrated, if they had lent the money they were given last fall as part of the Treasury Department’s $700 billion bailout plan, they would be in even more trouble than they are now. And we, the taxpayers, would be even worse off.

Why? Because the government bought preferred shares with its first round of capital injections, banks, whose capital cushions have already thinned drastically, must keep the capital on their books if they are eventually to repay the loans.

Yet if the banks directly lent the money being pumped into them, many could go bankrupt, requiring the government to step in again. At the end of the day, as Mr. Obama and others have acknowledged, the nation must have a viable financial system.

Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, whose bank received TARP funds, took the issue seriously last week on a conference call with investors. “There have been a lot of questions out there on whether banks are making loans,” he said. “We are making loans all the time, but we are trying to follow the intent and spirit of TARP, which is to help the economy of the United States recover and make sure we’re financing people.”

Mr. Dimon, however, represents just one bank, and it may be the only bulge bracket bank in the nation that is healthy.

Which leads us to the much-heralded idea of following Sweden’s model of nationalizing our banking system. This approach worked quite well for the Swedes in 1992, when their banking industry was teetering much the way ours is now after a real estate bubble and lax lending led to a realization that the banking system was insolvent.

The Swedes spent $11.7 billion at the time, taking huge stakes in their banks. It took years, but eventually, they sold these stakes successfully. And while the gamble at the time was huge — the bill was about 4 percent of its gross domestic product — some observers say Sweden has since been whole. So intriguing was the idea, the Swedes sent a delegation to Washington in September to talk about their experience.

But the Swedish model, as attractive as it appears at first blush, would be a challenge to pull off here in the United States. Aside from the fact that America isn’t about widespread nationalization, the biggest problem with the Swedish model is that when it is applied here, it costs more — much more.

America has already spent $1.5 trillion trying to solve our problem. To pull off a response similar to Sweden’s, we’d probably have to double, if not triple, that number. The chances we’d recover the money are even slimmer, given how much time it will take a larger economy like ours to come back from such a severe recession.

More important, the values of our financial garbage — subprime mortgages, C.D.O.’s and derivatives — may eventually prove ethereal. Sweden’s banks had at least backed real tangible assets.

With options narrowing, Mr. Obama is also being pressed to consider the Paulson “ring fence” plan, adopted by Mr. Brown of Britain on Monday. And while it may work there, it would be difficult to make it work here in a systemwide way. So far, it’s been used in an ad hoc manner, customized for each bank.

So we’ve been left with a plan pushed by Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that calls for the government to buy up toxic assets from the banks, similar to the original plan for the TARP money.

But that plan was abandoned for all the right reasons: it would mean government would either have to buy the assets at inflated prices from banks — and therefore lose even more money on them — or risk forcing such massive write-downs that the banks would be insolvent all over again.

I know what you’re saying: it’s easy to to knock down others’ ideas — what’s your idea?

Well, how about just following the current system of injecting money into banks to recapitalize them when they need it and “ring-fencing” bad assets when we can? It may not be popular, and it may take a while to work, but it’s one of the few viable alternatives. Perhaps we’ll have to pony up even more money — and maybe we should take an even bigger slice of equity — but it seems to be the best of many bad solutions.
674 2009-01-20 Still, the decision came as something of a surprise not only to the agents’ supporters, who had believed their chances for clemency were fading, but also for lawyers in other criminal cases who had been lobbying hard at the White House and the Justice Department on behalf of dozens of people seeking clemency.

A senior White House official said that the commutations announced on Monday would be Mr. Bush’s last acts of clemency before he leaves office.

There had been speculation that Mr. Bush might act in a number of high-profile cases, including those of I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, and the financier Michael R. Milken, both of whom were convicted on felony charges.

Mr. Bush was also said to have been considering pre-emptive action that could have shielded Alberto R. Gonzales, the former attorney general, and other government officials or intelligence officers who could face legal liability over their roles in interrogations, surveillance or other Bush administration policies.

Hundreds of other defendants convicted of garden-variety crimes have petitioned for leniency, seeking to shorten prison sentences their advocates see as excessive. But in the end, Mr. Bush used his clemency power to aid only Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean. He leaves office having granted 200 pardons and commutations, the fewest of any two-term president in modern times.

“I was shocked when I heard this was the only one,” said Margaret Colgate Love, a former Justice Department pardon lawyer who represents about 20 imprisoned clients who were seeking clemency. “There are a lot of disappointed lawyers in this town today.”

In the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Mr. Bush issued 33 clemency orders, an unusually fast clip for him. But he withdrew one pardon in December, for Isaac Toussie, a Brooklyn developer, after it was disclosed that Mr. Toussie was at the center of a Long Island real estate fraud case and that his family had given substantial donations to Republicans.

“The whole Toussie thing may very well have shot down any thoughts that Bush had of granting many routine pardons,” said P. S. Ruckman Jr., a political scientist who has studied presidential pardons.

In the case of the Border Patrol agents, Mr. Bush granted clemency without a formal recommendation from the Justice Department, which had not yet completed its review, officials said. It was the latest in a string of clemency decisions in which the White House did not rely on the formal process at the Justice Department for weighing the merits of clemency petitions.

Mr. Bush, who rarely speaks out on pardon issues, had voiced personal interest in the case two years ago, telling a television station in Texas that he planned to review all the facts to see if a pardon was warranted.

“I just want people to take a sober look at the case,” Mr. Bush said at the time. He noted that the case had generated “a lot of emotions” and added that “Border Patrol and law enforcement have no stronger supporter than me.”

Mr. Bush made no comment Monday as the Justice Department announced the commutations. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president “thinks they were fairly tried and received a just verdict” but that the punishment was “excessive, especially given the harsh conditions in which they have to serve their sentences.” Both men had been held in solitary confinement for their own protection since they were imprisoned about two and a half years ago.

Mr. Ramos, 39, received an 11-year sentence, while Mr. Compean, 32, got 12 years. The sentences were driven by a mandatory 10-year prison sentence for the use of a firearm in the assault, a condition that irked supporters who said the men were required to carry a gun in their border duties.

Federal prosecutors in Texas mounted a vigorous and unusual defense of the convictions, saying that they could not “look the other way” after the agents shot an unarmed man and then lied to their supervisors about it.

But the agents’ defenders criticized the prosecution as overzealous, rallying support around the country and in Washington. Many supporters of clemency were anti-immigration advocates who had lined up against Mr. Bush over his failed proposal for a temporary guest worker program.

“This is great news,” Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a California Republican who met with Mr. Bush several months ago to lobby for clemency, said in an interview. Mr. Bilbray said he had become so concerned that Mr. Bush would not grant the petition that he was working Monday on a plan to take the petition to President-elect Barack Obama.

“This never should have been the criminal case that it was,” he said. “This thing was blown out of proportion because, frankly, I think these men were crucified on the altar of people who were anti-Border Patrol” and advocates of immigration reform.

For supporters of the two men, the president’s decision was blunted by the fact that they were not given a full pardon, which would have cleared their records and restored some legal rights.

“This is something that we’d been hoping for and praying for a long time,” said T. J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents about 15,000 agents. “But it’s kind of a bittersweet victory, and we’re wondering what took so long. The sad thing is he waited until the last minute.”
675 2009-01-20 CLEVELAND (AP) — Kimmie Meissner, the women’s 2006 world champion, and Emily Hughes, Meissner’s teammate at the Turin Olympics, withdrew from this week’s United States Figure Skating Championships on Monday because of injury.

Meissner said she aggravated a hip flexor injury she sustained while running on a treadmill about a week ago. Hughes withdrew because of an ankle injury.

Meissner returned to her hometown, Baltimore, for physical therapy.

“The decision wasn’t easy and was not made lightly,” Meissner said in a statement from the United States Figure Skating Association. She added: “I tried to get on the ice, but I’m still experiencing pain doing jumps.”

Meissner burst onto the skating scene at the 2005 national championships, becoming the second United States woman to land a triple axel in competition. A year later, she surprised just about everyone by winning the world title. She won the national championship in 2007.

But she has struggled since. She was seventh at last year’s nationals and worlds. She received a spot on the world team only because three of the top four skaters at nationals were too young to compete at worlds.

Hughes, who placed second at the 2007 nationals, received a cortisone shot last week in hopes of being able to compete. But she said her ankle was not yet strong enough.

“I plan to resume training when my ankle heals and to compete again as soon as possible,” Hughes said.
676 2009-01-20 The writer is the author of a current book about his grandparents Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.

Adam Cohen correctly notes that the people who lived through the Great Depression and then the New Deal knew better — most Americans living then knew that President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s policies and leadership had improved their lives and lifted their spirits. The people demonstrated this decisively at the polls, as early as the 1934 midterm elections and in F.D.R.’s unprecedented three re-elections.

In these last days of a presidency, we should recall what a departing president who as a young man had those Great Depression and New Deal experiences, President Ronald Reagan, stated spontaneously, with humor and no regret, during his last weeks in office at a tribute to F.D.R.: “I had voted four times for the man we honor today.”

The writer, a law professor at St. John’s University, discovered and edited Justice Robert H. Jackson’s memoir, “That Man: An Insider’s Portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt.”

While schools nationwide gear up to acknowledge the inauguration of America’s 44th president, Barack Obama, it is important that they highlight the historical lessons of this particular inauguration and steer clear of any whiff of partisanship.

Not all families voted for Mr. Obama, and the larger lesson of America’s journey through the race landscape needs to be kept front and center.

Slaves built the White House, Bull Connor blasted hoses at peaceful African-American demonstrators in the civil rights era, and Rodney King endured a beating at the hands of white police officers in the early 1990s. Now, America readies to bear witness to the peaceful transfer of power to Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president.

Whether schools close, or bring together the community to watch the inauguration live, schools need to scaffold the history behind this incredible moment in America so as not to lose the teachable moment in the minefield of political partisanship.

The writer is head of the middle school at the Nueva School.

Three silent participants in Barack Obama’s historic inauguration will be two Jews and a black man: Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney.

Four decades ago, these brave young men gave their lives in Mississippi as part of the “Freedom Summer” that has made this great day possible.

America owes a heart-felt moment of silence for them and for all those who gave their lives for the right for all to vote, as we bear witness to the making of history on Jan. 20. Hope is in the air.

When my husband rode in the inaugural parade of John F. Kennedy 48 years ago to demonstrate racial equality as a young Japanese-American, he was a token and it was a sham. Now that we are poised to inaugurate a man of color as president of the United States, I can only hope that racial equality and justice will finally begin in this country with all sides understanding that the promise of our Constitution is real and participatory.

Both my husband and I grew up with our maternal grandparents as part of our Brooklyn households, back in the 1960s and 1970s. There was no question when we started our own family and moved to Westchester that my then-widowed mother would move in with us and help raise our two children.

Besides providing our children with the love and wisdom only a grandmother can give, my late mother was regarded as the “universal grandmother” to our community at large. Malia and Sasha Obama are luckier than they know. Merri Rosenberg

Ardsley, N.Y. Jan.

15, 2009
677 2009-01-20 That does not mean, Mr. Benge said, that Mr. Obama has won Oklahomans over, but only that the campaign season has ended. Do not look for Mr. Benge at any inaugural parties. He said he would be watching what he could of the ceremonies on television in his office between meetings.

But some people have, in fact, changed their minds. Leonard Nelson, 63, a 23-year veteran of both the Army and the Navy, said he had voted for Mr. McCain mainly through military fealty, believing that Mr. McCain’s own military record would make him a better commander in chief.

“But I’ve come to think the better man won,” said Mr. Nelson, owner of the Humidor Cigar Shop, an aromatic haven of pipes, blended tobaccos and customers on a first-name basis. Mr. Nelson said that Mr. Obama, through his cabinet selections, sent a signal of centrist government intention that feels all right to him.

Mr. Nelson’s customers like Cliff A. Stark, a lawyer and pipe smoker, were more representative of the spirit of pained resignation that is common here. “It’s just something you can’t do anything about,” Mr. Stark said.

At one of the city’s biggest evangelical megachurches, Victory Christian Center, with 17,000 members, there were also mixed messages of enthusiasm.

The church’s pastor and founder, Billy Joe Daugherty, said that the selection of the Rev. Rick Warren, a prominent evangelical minister from California, to give the inaugural invocation went a long way to easing fears in Mr. Daugherty’s mostly conservative congregation about a liberal social agenda. Mr. Obama’s selection of Mr. Warren has been denounced by many gay rights advocates and other liberal groups.

“What I’m sensing from Obama in making the choice he did — he’s saying to all groups, ‘Why don’t we come together?’ ” Mr. Daugherty said in an interview.

Inauguration Day, though, will be mostly business as usual. The 5th through 12th graders at Victory Christian Center will watch the ceremony on a big screen, but Mr. Daugherty said he would be traveling. Church staff members might watch in their offices, he said.

To be sure, Oklahoma remains subtly distinct from the national pattern. The state unemployment rate, while up almost a percentage point from where it stood in the fall, is still well below the national average. And the state budget, for the moment, is running a surplus.

Gun sellers have also prospered, marketing the notion that the Obama administration might try to tighten rules on gun ownership. What had been a monthly gun show near downtown has been held twice a month since November.

But an economy that looked solid enough two months ago to feel insulated — or at least not shaky enough to nudge many voters toward the idea of changing party control of the White House — has also shivered since then in the chill breeze of recession.

Ron Green saw a change in mid-November. Sales at the downtown deli owned by his wife, Susan, called The Greens on Boulder, dropped 30 percent in one week, compared with the previous year. “Business fell off a cliff,” said Mr. Green, who pitches in at lunch.

In conservations with customers, he said he had heard more business people agree lately that an Obama stimulus plan was sounding pretty good for the city.

Some black people here say their racial anxiety has heightened since the election, an ill-defined uneasiness they feel in mixed-race situations. With 380,000 residents, Tulsa is 70 percent white, 15 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic.

Princetta Rudd-Newman is living through that mix of hope and anxiety. She exults one minute over Mr. Obama’s election, she said, and frets the next over the future of the city she loves.

Her family has a long history here — an uncle began one of Tulsa’s oldest black-owned businesses, a funeral home, in 1917 — and Ms. Rudd-Newman has been trying this month to organize an inauguration party in the city’s historically black north end. But the money has not been coming in, especially at the $150-a-ticket Patriot level, pitched to local white-dominated corporations.

Ms. Rudd-Newman said she did not think it was about race. “It’s financial, in my perception,” she said. “It’s hard times.”

But it is also a time, for many people, to wait and see. The political debate over what might be has developed into more practical considerations about what can be done with the world as it is.

“Nothing’s changed,” said John Rittenoure, a software developer for Tulsa’s electric utility company, referring to his opinion of Mr. Obama. “But you’ve got to give the guy a chance, see what he can do.”
678 2009-01-20 PARIS — First-class and business-class air travel continued to slip in November as companies cut back amid the global slowdown, the International Air Transport Association said Monday.

Along with a sharp decline in freight shipments, the other profit source for airlines, the drop in premium passengers combined to paint a darkening picture for the aviation industry.

The International Air Transport Association, which has 230 members, said the number of passengers flying on premium tickets worldwide fell 11.5 percent in November, after a 6.9 percent drop in October. And the association warned that worse was still to come.

“The low point for air travel has not yet been reached since the economic environment is still deteriorating,” the association said, adding that industrial production and business confidence had fallen sharply in major economies across Asia, Europe and North America.

The steepest drops in premium travel, the airline organization said, came in the long-distance markets.
679 2009-01-20 Microsoft, which has already paid more than 1 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, in fines, was given eight weeks to respond.

Some legal specialists were puzzled by the latest investigation, which stemmed from a complaint filed in December 2007 by Opera, an Oslo-based maker of a competing Web browser. Microsoft is already working under an American consent decree covering Internet Explorer.

Recent market studies suggest that Microsoft’s Internet Explorer may be losing ground to competing browsers like Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome.

“Frankly, I am very confused by this latest complaint,” said Denis Waelbroeck, a professor of competition law at the Free University of Brussels. “The timing is all wrong and the case on browsers is not black and white.”

But Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based lawyer representing Opera, said the commission would not be looking into the complaint if they did not think it was “problematic.”

“As Web computing becomes more significant and the possibilities for computing independent of the underlying operating system grow dramatically, this is a battle for the future,” he said.

Microsoft’s previous, nine-year legal fight with the commission centered in part on its bundling of the Windows Media Player into Windows, which is found on more than 90 percent of computers in the world, according to the research firm, Gartner.

Microsoft eventually dropped its challenge after losing an appeal in September 2007.

While that fight generated huge legal bills and reams of negative publicity for Microsoft, the remedies imposed have not appeared to dent the company’s business in Europe.

The commission ordered Microsoft to sell a separate version of Windows in Europe without Windows Media Player. Microsoft complied, but consumers rejected the stripped-down software in favor of the full version with the player, which was sold at the same price.

This time, the commission may consider other options, like requiring Microsoft to include the competing browsers in Windows, Mr. Vinje said. But other lawyers said such a remedy would be unprecedented and difficult to impose.

“This is a question about who designs software, the private sector or the regulators?” said Alec Burnside, a competition lawyer in Brussels at Linklaters, a firm that has represented Microsoft. “Can you really imagine Microsoft supporting a Google platform?”

Also likely to play a role in the investigation are developments in the browser market. According to Net Applications, a research firm in Aliso Viejo, Calif., Microsoft had 68 percent of the global browser market, compared with 21.3 percent for Firefox, 7.9 percent for Safari, 1.0 percent for Chrome and 0.7 percent for Opera.

That was down from more than 80 percent two years ago.

Mr. Vinje disputed the figures, saying his research showed Microsoft’s market share to still be about 85 percent.

Others said growing competition made the complaint moot.

“This is clearly a follow-on to the previous investigation, but the dominance isn’t as clear,” said Damien Geradin, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels at Howrey.

Under a 2002 consent decree, the Justice Department monitors Microsoft’s use of Internet Explorer to ensure competitors are not disadvantaged through the Windows operating system.

Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the European Commission’s competition division, said the investigation was beginning and it was too early to speculate on outcomes.

Microsoft could request a private hearing, after which the commission could take up to a year for a decision, which Microsoft could then appeal in court.
680 2009-01-20 The murder bore the characteristics of a contract killing, a not-uncommon phenomenon in Russia. Even so, the audacity of Mr. Markelov’s murder surprised some commentators.

“Even when organized crime in the 1990s was rampant, such a killing would have been considered bold and horrific,” said a correspondent from Vesti television.

Mr. Markelov, who was the director of the Rule of Law Institute, a civil liberties group, gained prominence recently representing the family of Elza Kungayeva. She was an 18-year-old Chechen whom Mr. Budanov, the former tank commander, admitted strangling in his quarters in March 2000, just as the second post-Soviet war in Chechnya was beginning to rage.

Mr. Budanov was sentenced to 10 years in prison but was given early parole for good behavior.

Mr. Markelov, at the news conference just before his death, told reporters that he might file an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against the early release of Mr. Budanov, who was a decorated colonel of the Russian Army before he was stripped of his rank. In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Markelov said he might also file a lawsuit against the administration of the prison that released Mr. Budanov last Thursday.

The decision to free Mr. Budanov set off street protests and outraged some human rights groups and Chechen officials. It reignited long-simmering tensions years after a decade of intermittent war in Chechnya, a southern Russian republic, was replaced by tenuous stability.

But Mr. Budanov was also revered by nationalists as a valiant fighter who helped wage a bloody but necessary war against separatist rebels in Chechnya. Some now see Mr. Markelov’s murder as revenge for his efforts against a Russian hero.

“The murder of Markelov, I consider a bold open warning by the ‘party of war’ to democratic Russia,” Nudri S. Nukhazhiev, Chechnya’s human rights ombudsman, said in a statement. “Today, there are no facts or evidence of the direct participation of Budanov in this crime, but I am more than certain that it was committed by his supporters with his consent.”

Mr. Markelov phoned the father of Ms. Kungayeva, the slain teenager, a few days ago to complain that he had received death threats, the father told the Interfax news agency.

Lela Khamzayeva, another lawyer for Ms. Kungayeva’s family, was adamant, however, that the killing of Mr. Markelov could not be linked to his connection with Mr. Budanov, because his role during the actual proceedings against the former colonel was, as she put it, “insignificant.”

“If someone is trying to link this murder with Markelov’s participation in the Budanov case, well, that’s just ridiculous,” she said.

Given Mr. Markelov’s propensity for challenging the Russian authorities and others known to settle scores violently, the list of potential suspects is lengthy.

He worked closely with Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist with Novaya Gazeta and strong critic of Russia’s Chechnya policies, who was murdered in Moscow in 2006.

He often defended the interests of those, like Ms. Kungayeva, who became ensnared in the violent and often arbitrary military justice of the Chechen conflict or the tyrannical rule of Chechnya’s violence-prone leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, in the war’s aftermath.

“He handled almost every case opened as a result of the work of Anna Politkovskaya,” said Nadezhda Prusenkova, a spokeswoman for Novaya Gazeta.

While he was not involved in the current trial of three men accused in the murder of Ms. Politkovskaya, Mr. Markelov did work on the case of another murdered Novaya Gazeta journalist, Igor Domnikov, who died in 2000 from wounds caused by a hammer blow to the head.

Mr. Markelov has also represented victims of neo-fascist and xenophobic violence, a phenomenon that has been expanding annually both in frequency and intensity, according to experts.

At least 10 people were killed and 9 others injured in racist attacks in Russia in the first two weeks of 2009, said Aleksandr Brod, the head of the Moscow Human Rights Bureau, Interfax reported.

Ms. Baburova, the freelancer who was killed Monday, began working for Novaya Gazeta last October. She cited Mr. Markelov in her most recent article about fascist groups, published on Saturday.

In it, the lawyer criticized the authorities for their handling of a case against the leader of a violent nationalist group, who was sentenced to three years in prison for arranging the murder of a man from Tajikistan and putting video of the killing on the Internet.

With Ms. Baburova’s death, Novaya Gazeta has lost four reporters to murder or other mysterious circumstances since 2000.
681 2009-01-20 Fears focused on the Royal Bank of Scotland as nearly two-thirds of its market value was wiped out after its disclosure that it would probably report a full year loss of £28 billion ($41.3 billion). That would be the biggest loss ever reported by a British company. Shares closed at 11.6 pence, down 23.1 pence.

Among the raft of measures unveiled earlier, the British government said it would increase its stake in RBS to 70 percent from 58 percent by converting preference shares into ordinary shares.

“It is clear from the markets reaction today that it increasingly believes that RBS is to end up fully in government ownership,” said Nic Clarke, an analyst at the Charles Stanley brokerage firm in London.

The other British banks also suffered, with newly merged Lloyds Banking down a third.

Barclays, which had earlier recouped most of its 25 percent decline on Friday, was back under pressure, with its shares 10 percent lower, to 88 pence.

“Sentiment and confidence is absolutely shot to pieces in the banks, and the markets are voting with their feet,” said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London.

The British banking sector’s latest stock market woes came after the government introduced a plan that would require banks to identify their riskiest assets and allow them to pay a fee to insure them with the government in return for lending more money. By offering to insure bank loans, the government is exposing taxpayers to billions of pounds of potential losses.

In addition, the government gave the Bank of England the approval to, in effect, start printing money by buying £50 billion ($74 billion) of whatever bank assets it considers to be necessary.

The problems in Britain’s banking system sent shockwaves through Europe.

In Germany, Deutsche Bank, which last week reported a 4.8 billion euro ($6.4 billion) loss for the fourth quarter, sank 8 percent, while Commerzbank fell 3.71 percent.

In France, BNP Paribas and Société Générale were also down.

The problems potentially facing Europe’s banks were stoked last week by Citigroup’s announcement that it would split its operations in two, separating its traditional banking business from the company’s riskier assets, as it posted a $8.3 billion fourth-quarter loss.

Bank of America also revealed a $2.4 billion quarterly loss and had to tap the federal government for a cash injection of $20 billion in exchange for stock.

Stock markets around the world had started 2009 on a relatively strong footing, glad to have put the previous year behind them and hopeful that the incoming Obama administration would be able to limit the length and depth of the recession in the United States with its stimulus plan.

Those hopes of a turnaround in the world economy by the middle of this year have evaporated as investors grappled with increasingly grim economic and corporate data from across the world.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock average gained 26.70 points, or 0.32 percent, to 8,256.85; the Kospi in South Korea gained 1.36 percent, to 1,150.65; and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong recovered early losses to rise 0.64 percent, to 13,339.99.

Shanghai’s benchmark rose 1.7 percent and markets in Australia and Singapore also gained.

Wall Street was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King’s Birthday holiday.

705 2009-01-21 After the Neighborhood Ball, a $25-a-head party that was meant to make the evening accessible to just about anyone, the Obamas walked upstairs at the convention center to the Obama Home States Ball, a party for residents of Illinois and Hawaii.

Hours before the Obamas appeared, the Don Cagen Orchestra, a band from Chicago, began warming up with songs from the 1950s and ’60s, including “A Change Is Gonna Come.”

But most of the partygoers ignored the music and clustered in front of the center stage, waiting for the stars of the evening.

“The ultimate is seeing the president and the first lady,” said Susan Peevy, 45, a postal worker from Rockville, Md. “I don’t know who’s performing, and I don’t care. Just so they show up.”

They finally did, just after 9 p.m., emerging from backstage hand in hand.

“Aloha!” Mr. Obama hollered into the microphone. “What’s going on?”

“This is a special ball,” he continued. “Because it represents our roots: Hawaii, Illinois. And together you’ve given us so much.”

The Obamas walked onstage after a dramatic introduction by eight uniformed officers, and began dancing while the crowd cheered them on, clapping.

“Step, Barack!” one 50ish woman in the audience shouted helpfully.

Men wore black tie, and women wore beaded dresses, swishy chiffon and the occasional fur. In honor of Lincoln, a few black top hats peeked out above the crowd.

Of course, the glamour days of the Reagan inaugural balls are long gone, and the crowds Tuesday did not come for the music, the pasta buffet or the $12 glasses of Champagne. (Accordingly, the cost of a ticket has inched up only to $150 from $100 in 1981.)

“I figured it would be like the black-tie opening of an auto show,” said Carolyn Grisko of Chicago, who declared herself an authority on political soirees.

Yet tens of thousands of the Democratic Party faithful gathered throughout the city in cavernous, drafty ballrooms that held more than 5,000 people.

At the Biden Home States Ball, Delaware’s elected officials basked in the glow of the new vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has instantly elevated their small state — know more for its status as a corporate tax haven than its political might — to national prominence.

“I won’t say this is what we have always waited for, but we are sure glad it finally happened,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper, who arrived wearing a red bow tie with his wife, Martha, who wore a lavender gown.

For much of the evening, guests mingled uneasily across a ballroom the length of a football field, vast expanses of which remained empty two hours into the evening. An unknown band played “We Are Family” and exhorted guests to dance. By 8 p.m., about 20 people obliged.

Many groused about the food: tortellini, stuffed baked chicken and raw vegetables. “Cafeteria food,” one guest sniffed.

At the Mid-Atlantic Ball, attended by Gov. David A. Paterson of New York and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the crowd moved from the bar and the food tables and approached the stage, waving their arms and cheering when Wyclef Jean played the national anthem on his guitar.

Across town in Dupont Circle, thousands of young volunteers to the Obama campaign lined up for two hours to get inside the Youth Ball, a $75-a-head event intended for partygoers ages 18 to 35.

Security was tight, and even some invited MTV guests, which included Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, were asked to endure some of the cold outside before gaining admission.

Tickets were highly prized, but friends of Obama volunteers sometimes got lucky. Cameron Coffey, 25, said a “friend of a friend” who was a volunteer called her three hours before the ball with an offer of a ticket.

“I had a dress, so I just came on down,” Ms. Coffey said.

Kanye West, the rapper, said he was privileged to be performing at the ball. “And I’m really glad I’m not singing outdoors,” he added.
706 2009-01-21 Russia resumed pumping natural gas through Ukraine to Europe on Tuesday, after two weeks of disruption in a dispute over prices. The gas was expected to reach energy-starved homes to the west within three days. The Russian gas monopoly, Gazprom, said that the flow of gas was restarted around 10:30 a.m. Several hours later, gas began pouring across Ukraine’s western border into Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Moldova, The Associated Press reported. The prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement on Monday to resolve a dispute over the price of natural gas and the terms of its transshipment. Russia halted the supplies on Jan. 6, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes in southeastern Europe without heat and causing the shutdown of hundreds of factories.
707 2009-01-21 In saluting “our patchwork heritage,” President Obama could have been describing his audience that stretched back toward the Lincoln Memorial — a splendid array of skin color, assembled pride and historic sharing that put a fresh gleam on that well-worn notion of American politics, integration.

Beyond celebrating Lincoln and emancipation, the throngs included tribes of American Indians celebrating — oh yes, “O-ba-ma!” — like victorious conventioneers in their burnished regalia at a hotel party Monday night. Downtown, bars were booming under a sliver of moon on a cold night. The Metro trains were busy with travelers in gowns and tuxes. One young African-American father rode almost dreamily, his thoughts somewhere else as he repeatedly kissed the forehead of his child.

The next day, under the inaugural sunshine, just as the president took the oath, a bearded black man in a fur coat shouted with a near gasp: “You the man!” Some in the crowd had to caper — two women doing the cancan and waving a sign: “Yes we Can-Can!” But others quietly showed tears. Anyone in the crowd had to hope the new president, for all his careful warning about hard times, got a sense of how the public rooted for him on Day 1.

The inaugural crowd of Ronald Reagan had its own joy and made a great scene 28 years ago. But that felt much more about one party’s victory, particularly when he denounced government itself as the problem, not the solution.

That remains a shocking notion in a democracy, and Mr. Obama took aim at it. He summoned the throng before him, and the nation all about, to abandon the “stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long.” Show that government does indeed work, was his prescription, yoking the fortunes of both public and president. “We must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,” said President Obama, touching the crowd’s craving for something basic, something lately untried.

The Obama speech patterns became a separate source of celebration, the way John F. Kennedy imitators used to do “vi-gah” salutes. After the speech, a man happily walking a bridge back to Virginia as the best way home suddenly tried an Obama riff on his friends. “We must walk the bridge built by our ancestors! We will find it long and hard! And we will confront Exit 10 C — wherever it leads!” His friends laughed and shared the pleasure of having heard firsthand President Obama in his opening hour.

Farther ahead on the bridge, a man who came up from Georgia to hear Mr. Obama said he’ll be grateful forever to have been in that crowd on the Mall. He said his new president didn’t pull punches in convincing him that “this winter of our hardship” will be seasons long. “But it’s gonna be alright,” the Georgian firmly insisted as the inaugural crowd dispersed out toward home and the future.
708 2009-01-21 Millions of cubicle dwellers across the country helped set records for Internet traffic on Tuesday as they watched online video of the inauguration ceremonies  or at least tried to. The overwhelming demand meant that some Web sites and data networks had trouble keeping up, forcing many people to turn to less cutting-edge forms of media.

“It was really frustrating to have this great technology and still not be able to watch the speech,” said Dan Robinson, who runs the box office at the Julliard School in New York. “I had to use this TV from the early ’80s and some rabbit ears to watch it.”

Internet traffic in the United States hit a record peak at the start of President Obama’s speech as people watched, read about and commented on the inauguration, according to Bill Woodcock, the research director at the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that analyzes online traffic. The figures surpassed even the high figures on the day President Obama was elected.

“The peak is the highest measured to date, and it appears to be mostly a U.S. phenomenon,” Mr. Woodcock said, adding that it did not appear that global records would be set.

When people are checking for election results or the score for a big game, they tend to produce smaller bursts of traffic spread out over several hours. On Tuesday, everyone wanted to watch video, and that produced bulky streams of data traveling from media companies’ data centers out to people at work and in their homes.

Data from CNN.com captured the uniqueness of the online surge. CNN said it provided more than 21.3 million video streams over a nine-hour span up to midafternoon. That blew past the 5.3 million streams provided during all of Election Day. At its peak, CNN.com fed 1.3 million live streams simultaneously, according to Jennifer Martin, a spokeswoman for the site.

Akamai, which helps companies meet demand for their online offerings, worked with media companies like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Viacom to stream live video. It reported a record-breaking day, feeding up seven million video streams at one time.

While the raw figures look impressive, people unable to access the videos felt less than ecstatic about the state of Internet technology. The snags highlighted one advantage that is still held by old-fashioned television: its viewers are not forced to compete with one another for the right to watch a particular channel.

“I really didn’t get to see any of it,” said Daniel Wild, a Web site editor at the New York University School of Medicine. “Ultimately, I just saw frozen images of sections of what happened.”

CNN tried to assuage those who could not access its live feed by posting a note to visitors saying they were in line to receive a working stream.

“We built capacity for CNN.com Live to handle well above and beyond what was, to our knowledge, the most-viewed live video event in Internet history,” Ms. Martin said.

A spokeswoman for The Times, Stacy Green, said its site served more video viewers than expected, and that there had “not been any major problems.”

The viewing troubles may have been more a result of the limited Internet capacity coming to offices and houses, rather than a lack of overall bandwidth from the media companies, according to Mr. Woodcock. The United States continues to suffer from less-than-robust bandwidth, which Mr. Woodcock attributes to inadequate government attention and limited competition between Internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast. President Obama, in fact, mentioned the issue in the very speech that people were trying to watch.

“We’ve had eight years of stagnation and need to get to work solving problems like this,” Mr. Woodcock said.
709 2009-01-21 Or, as in Frank’s case, the coach has confidence from management, and they are united through a shared vision. That vision is currently toward the Nets’ future, after Jason Kidd was traded last season and Richard Jefferson was dealt in the off-season.

But somehow, Frank, 38, has kept the boat largely afloat, restructuring his offense around Devin Harris while integrating the promising rookie Brook Lopez and placating Vince Carter. The Nets are 19-22 and hold the eighth and final playoff spot in the East.

“You’ve got to be realistic about what you have and where you’re going,” Thorn said. “I won’t say what they do is wrong and what we do is right, but to me, you make a change when things aren’t going the way you want to or players aren’t living up to their potential.”

Thorn should know. He fired Sloan when they were with the Chicago Bulls in 1982, eventually paving Sloan’s way to Utah. But Thorn hangs on to Frank, through the inevitable and occasional hot seat and now a team makeover.

“Maybe I learned something from that,” Thorn joked of firing Sloan.

He added: “You’ve got Jerry Sloan and Popovich have been around a while, there’s been a lot of changes, and we don’t need to go back to any farther than to the first part of this year, when six coaches were fired before Christmas. In basketball, probably more so than in other major sports, there have been a lot of changes.”

Frank has won two division titles with the Nets but has yet to lead them past the conference semifinals. That stands in contrast to their two appearances in the N.B.A. finals under Scott, his predecessor who is now coach of the New Orleans Hornets.

Yet Frank is considered one of the hardest-working coaches in the N.B.A. after climbing his way up the ladder: from a manager position under Bob Knight at Indiana, to assistant coaching stints at Marquette and Tennessee, to assistant jobs in the N.B.A. with the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Nets.

Thorn first hired Frank to serve on Scott’s staff on the recommendation of Stu Jackson, a former Grizzlies general manager who is now the league’s executive vice president in charge of discipline. When the Nets stumbled under Scott, Thorn promoted Frank. At the time, he was the N.B.A’s youngest coach, and he still displays a boyish exterior that underlies his passion for the game.

“He’s a no-nonsense type of guy,” said Ed Stefanski, the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, who previously worked in that role with the Nets. “He will listen to a player, but when a player doesn’t do it the way he wants, then it’s his way or nothing at all.”

When asked about the anniversary, Frank said he could not remember the exact date.

“It’s coming up?” he asked. “I don’t really think about it. The thing in this profession, you look at the rate of many of the coaches and the duration, you consider yourself fortunate to coach great players, work for a great ownership group and have a good staff.”

Among his players, Frank is applauded for his preparedness. Most days, he is among the first to the practice facility and the last one out. He often knows the opposition’s plays as well as he does his own.

“The players see it,” Stefanski said. “That is crucial. They know that they’re going to be in the right spot at the right time. When the other team runs a play, he knows exactly what the play call is.”

Frank feeds the mind and the body, running conditioning drills with his players and offering them motivational books.

“The one thing that I do really respect about him, is he always allowed you to have film sessions with him,” said the Celtics’ Brian Scalabrine, who played with the Nets from 2001 to 2005. “He wants guys that want to get in there and learn, and he makes time for that.”

Nets point guard Keyon Dooling, who was acquired in the off-season, said of Frank: “He’s a hard worker. Very, very hands on. He does a good job of bringing his energy and motor every day. He has a unique ability to communicate.”

Still, there is a longevity in Frank that has eluded other hard-working coaches. Eddie Jordan, for example, was among the coaches fired this season. He had guided the Washington Wizards to four consecutive playoff appearances after a seven-year postseason drought.

Jordan and Frank were both assistants during Scott’s tenure, working late nights and fine-tuning their own coaching tactics.

“You’ve got to have adaptability,” Jordan said of today’s coaches. “With injuries, an 82-game schedule and personalities that vary from time to time, you’ve got to be able to adjust as you go through the journey. Everyone says, We need a change because we need a different voice. Lawrence has different voices within himself.”

Collectively, those voices are all loath to talk of themselves. If Frank’s team is doing well, it’s because of sources outside of his control. It the Nets perform poorly, he is among the first to shoulder the blame.

“Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be able to do it back home,” Frank, a native of Teaneck, said of coaching the Nets. “From the standpoint of being from Jersey and staying in Jersey and most importantly, my family and wife and to have our kids growing up in Bergen County with both sets of grandparents. Every day you’re passionate. And you love coming to work every day.”
710 2009-01-21 MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Rafael Nadal traded in his trademark sleeveless top for a more conservative T-shirt. But even if his bulging biceps were no longer in view for his first-round match in the Australian Open, they were still a driving force behind his muscular approach to the game.

The top-ranked Nadal bullied Christophe Rochus with some powerful forehands and 10 aces Tuesday night in a 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 victory at Rod Laver Arena. Nadal hit 47 winners, and Rochus could not get near most of them.

“You know, the sport is like this,” Nadal said. “Because if you are not playing all the time 100 percent — if I had some mistakes in some moments — he can come close back to me and anything can happen.”

In early second-round matches Wednesday, third-seeded Novak Djokovic, the defending men’s champion, shook off a first-set challenge to advance. Jeremy Chardy matched Djokovic shot for shot before wilting, 7-5, 6-1, 6-3.

Djokovic held serve in all but one game, when he was broken at love while serving for the match at 5-2 in the third. But he broke right back, finishing the match when Chardy netted a forehand.
711 2009-01-21 Viktor Kozeny, a Czech businessman wanted in the United States on charges of bribing government officials in Azerbaijan, settled a lawsuit filed against him by a hedge fund, Omega Advisors.

Lawyers for Mr. Kozeny told the High Court in London on Tuesday that a settlement had been reached in the fraud suit, which sought more than $100 million in damages.

Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but as a result of the deal, court orders freezing millions of dollars of Mr. Kozeny’s assets were lifted.

“After more than nine years, this action is to be brought to an end,” Mr. Kozeny’s lawyer, Richard Sloe, told Justice Christopher Clarke.

Omega claimed Mr. Kozeny had defrauded it and other investors of $180 million in a 1998 investment in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. They said he had charged them $25 each for options in the proposed privatization of the state oil company that cost him 40 cents.

Mr. Kozeny and a co-defendant, Frederick Bourke, face a criminal trial in New York in June on charges that they had bribed Azeri leaders as part of the investment scheme. Mr. Kozeny is a fugitive in the Bahamas and has not appeared in the case. Mr. Bourke, who invested with Mr. Kozeny, denies the charges.
712 2009-01-21 WASHINGTON — Protesters, a fixture of every inauguration since President Nixon’s in 1973, were few and scattered on Tuesday as Barack Obama assumed the presidency. It appeared there were far more vendors looking to make a buck selling Inaugural Chocolate Bars and Obama Incense than protesters seeking to make a statement.

Those who raised their voices were more likely to be expressing gratitude that former President George W. Bush was leaving office than displeasure that Mr. Obama was replacing him.

Some boos could be heard in the crowd gathered on the mall when Vice President Dick Cheney and Mr. Bush were introduced for Mr. Obama’s swearing-in.

And when it was over, a chant of “na na na na, hey hey, goodbye” arose from some among the throng on the Mall as Mr. Bush’s helicopter flew by carrying him to Andrews Air Force Base and on to his retirement in Texas.

In the streets surrounding the parade route, an occasional anti-Bush sign could be seen, protesting his treatment of the Kurds in Iraq or just urging him to get out of town. Some along the parade route held signs demanding that Mr. Bush be indicted.
713 2009-01-21 After a casual perusal of recent court orders in the case, Louis P. Petrich, a lawyer who is considered one of Hollywood’s leading authorities on copyright and trademark matters, said he was unconvinced by the Isis claim. “I don’t see any basis for a state court to do this,” Mr. Petrich said.

Bankruptcy is one exception, Mr. Petrich said, and a court could perhaps transfer certain nonexclusive copyrights. But nonexclusive rights are significantly less valuable. “With nonexclusive rights, you’re not going to be an infringer if you use them, but you can’t prevent anyone else from using them either,” Mr. Petrich said.

Back in Colorado, where Mr. Smith’s firm bills itself as “The Law Out West,” Isis disagrees. “The rights that Isis now holds are exclusive rights,” Mr. Smith said. “Svensk has no further rights to the films.”

Mr. Smith said that the original lawsuit involving the theater was served to Svensk at an office in California, now defunct, establishing jurisdiction in the United States. Furthermore, Mr. Smith said, Colorado law holds that a state judge can order the transfer of assets if a defendant refuses to pay a judgment.

Svensk has certainly refused to pay — or to participate in recent court proceedings at all.

The Isis and Svensk dispute began in 1997. The Swedish company, according to court documents, was then a co-owner of Resort Theaters of America, which operated a chain of cinemas in second-home communities like Aspen. Resort Theaters in 1997 had asked the owners of the Isis Theater, which opened in 1915, to allow them to convert the historic building into a five-screen cineplex. To persuade Isis to participate in the costly project, Svensk guaranteed in writing the long-term lease.

In 2000 Resort Theaters filed for bankruptcy and rejected the Isis lease. Svensk refused to pay on the guarantee. In 2003 a Colorado court found Svensk liable, awarding Isis a judgment of almost $7 million. Svensk appealed the judgment to the Colorado Court of Appeals and the Colorado Supreme Court, which each found in favor of Isis.

In May 2008 Colorado District Judge Denise K. Lynch found Svensk in contempt of court for refusing to disclose its assets to Isis, fining the company $2,500 a day. Around this time, according to Mr. Smith, Svensk stopped communicating with him or with the court, and the company’s original lawyer, Mr. Wise, resigned. In July Judge Lynch ordered Svensk to hand over all its films to Isis within 30 days.

After silence from Svensk — and with the judgment against Svensk now reaching about $10 million — Judge Lynch in September appointed an outside lawyer to transfer all of Svensk’s film rights to Isis, a process of filing with the United States Copyright Office that took until December to complete.

Mr. Smith says Isis — he won’t name the members of the investor group publicly, except to say “there is no major media company or the like involved” — now intends to capitalize on its new asset. (The Aspen multiplex is still operating, but under different owners who have nothing to do with this litigation.) The library of Bergman, who died in 2007, is just the tip of the Svensk cinematic iceberg, with some 200 titles, most of them obscure, also registered by Isis with the copyright office.

Isis lacks physical prints of the films, but Mr. Smith says that is not of primary concern. DVDs now available in the market contain digital copies of sufficient quality, Mr. Smith said. “We are still in the process of figuring all of that out,” he said.

Fans of Bergman in particular and of Swedish cinema in general are likely to applaud any action at all involving the Svensk library. In the United States, at least, very little distribution has taken place in recent years, possibly because of a lack of commercial interest but also possibly because, as Mr. Smith contends, Svensk wanted to avoid the market to avoid seizures that might have been made to satisfy the Isis judgment.

Since 2005, after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in its favor, Isis has been paid royalties from some DVD distribution of Svensk works by companies like Janus Films, a distributor of classic and foreign films.

Those royalties total $520,000, according to Mr. Smith.

Mr. Smith said that Isis was willing to transfer the rights back to Svensk if it paid off the judgment. Otherwise, he added, Isis would seek buyers for the library or use it in any way it could.

Who might buy the library? Film-financing experts said that companies like Janus or Independent Film Channel could kick the tires, but that the holdings might not be as valuable as Isis hopes.

“This library is certainly very prestigious but probably has very little commercial viability,” said Amir Malin, a partner at Qualia Capital, a media-focused investment company with assets that include several large film libraries.

“I think any serious player would take one look at the unusual circumstances here and decide it’s too much of a legal risk,” he continued. “It may end up being an interesting tale and not much else.”
714 2009-01-21 Barack Obama hasn’t been president one full day and he has already inspired a musical. “Obama on My Mind,” with book, music and lyrics by Teddy Hayes, will have its premiere at the Hens and Chickens Theater in Islington, a London borough, in March, Playbill.com reported. According to a release, the show will take a “humorous look at the weird and wonderful world behind the scenes of a small Obama campaign office and the larger-than-life characters who make the wheels turn, the cogs whirr and bring in the votes.” The musical will feature a mixture of pop, rock, gospel and jazz songs; it is scheduled to begin performances on March 3, with its official opening on March 5 for a run through March 21.
715 2009-01-21 Temple Grandin’s “Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior” (2004) occupies a special place among the animal books of the last few decades. Ms. Grandin’s autism gives her a special understanding of what animals, whether house cats or cattle, think, feel and  perhaps most important  desire. There is a revelation on almost every page, and Ms. Grandin’s prose (she wrote with Catherine Johnson) is ungainly in the best possible way: blunt, sweet, off-kilter and often quite funny.

Ms. Grandin’s new book, “Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals,” also written with Ms. Johnson, picks up where “Animals in Translation” left off. It has a slightly different focus: she concentrates this time on the emotional rather than the physical life of animals, although the two are clearly related.

There is a good deal of rehashing of material from her previous book, and she leans more here on the ideas of others than she did before. But to remark that “Animals Make Us Human” is a slightly lesser book than “Animals in Translation” is like saying Randy Newman’s “Good Old Boys” is a slightly lesser album than “Sail Away.” If you liked the first one, you’re going to like the second.

Ms. Grandin bases many of her observations in “Animals Make Us Human” on the work of a Washington State University neuroscientist named Jaak Panksepp who identified a series of core “emotion systems” in animals: seeking, play, care and lust (on the positive side) and fear, panic and rage (on the negative).

“The rule is simple,” Ms. Grandin writes. “Don’t stimulate rage, fear and panic if you can help it, and do stimulate seeking and also play.” Ms. Grandin employs Dr. Panksepp’s terms throughout “Animals Make Us Human,” but they are really only a framework for her more interesting riffing and observations.

There are provocative chapters here on dogs (Ms. Grandin quibbles with some of the alpha-male ideas of Cesar Millan, television’s “Dog Whisperer”) and cats. Ms. Grandin is at her best, however, when she is talking about animals like cows, pigs, horses and chickens, as well as wild animals and those in zoos.

Ms. Grandin has designed humane and stress-free slaughter systems that are used now to process about half of all the cattle in the United States and Canada. There is some cognitive dissonance here. She is often asked, she tells us, “How can you care about animals when you design slaughter plants?”

Her reply is that “some people think death is the most terrible thing that can happen to an animal.” She argues that “the most important thing for an animal is the quality of its life.”

She adds: “The more I observe and learn about how dogs are kept today, I am more convinced that many cattle have better lives than some of the pampered pets. Too many dogs are alone all day with no human or dog companions.”

She worries about the “totally adversarial” relationship between animal advocacy groups and the livestock industry. She has kind words for companies like McDonald’s and Wendy’s (she has consulted for both), which are forcing their suppliers to treat animals more humanely. But she also praises activists. “The big companies are like steel, and activists are like heat. Activists soften the steel, and then I can bend it into pretty grillwork and make reforms.”

One of the major points in “Animals Make Us Human” is the importance of hiring and training good people to work with livestock. Strong, caring managers are needed; bullying and sadistic employees should be fired; and because turnover in these industries is high, constant training and retraining are necessary, as well as constant auditing from the outside.

Ms. Grandin is in favor of almost total openness  she’s among the writers who believe that slaughterhouses should have glass walls. “No animal should spend its last conscious moments in a state of terror,” she writes, and any visitor should be able to observe that they do not.

Ms. Grandin loves solid, declarative sentences: “Cattle hate being yelled at”; “Pigs are obsessed with straw”; “Cows like to learn new things.” So I’ll add one of my own: We’re lucky to have Temple Grandin.

But here’s something I thought about while reading “Animals Make Us Human”: while I would not want Ms. Grandin to discontinue her work with animals, even for a day, as a reader I’d be curious to watch her unusual mind play over other topics.

She has already written one very fine memoir, “Thinking in Pictures” (1995). I can envision a second, with a slightly different focus. Human beings can often be made to feel like cattle, especially in large cities. What would she have to say about subways, housing projects, stadiums, prisons, office cubicles, long-distance buses, shelters for the homeless, elevators or, I dunno, the security line at La Guardia? What are her thoughts about urban planning in general?
716 2009-01-21 Another woman, an immigrant from El Salvador, said she was glad to be heading to work.

“I would like to see it, but I don’t like crowds,” said the woman, who was waiting for a bus near the Anacostia subway station on her way to clean houses. “Mostly though, I think I’m lucky to have a job so I’m not complaining.”

She said that like so many other undocumented residents of the city, she hopes the new president will address issues that have fallen off the map over the past year like immigration reform.

“So many people are waiting to see if Obama will have the guts to do what needs to be done to make things better,” she said.

At restaurants and hotels, workers said they planned to track the day’s events nonetheless. One man cradled a muted handheld television as he marched down North Capitol Street to his security guard job at a hotel. Another woman strapped a battery-powered radio to her satchel as she biked to her job at a Howard University Hospital.

At a homeless shelter for women on D street northwest, a room of about 74 women sat on folding chairs huddled around the shelter’s one television waiting for the inauguration to begin.

Chapman Todd, the director of Catholic Charities, which runs the shelter, said that missing work was not an option for him because a large number of people from downtown had been moved into his shelter to make way for the event. Area shelters were also staying open around the clock rather than only at night as is their normal schedule, he said.

Minutes before Mr. Obama was sworn in, a group of wayward tourists from New York knocked on the shelter door asking to use the bathroom. When they realized they were about to miss the speech, the tourists pulled up chairs and sat with the homeless women.

“At a time when many people are uncertain, it was a real moment of unity,” said Mr. Todd, adding that many of the women who live in the shelter are low-wage workers who fear they may soon lose their jobs.

Along Georgia Avenue, Grace Bivins stood like a sentinel behind her grooming chair at Shelton’s Salon.

“My clients need me right here,” she said.

As a 65-year-old woman who said she had seen the worst of racism the country had to offer in Washington and elsewhere, Ms. Bivins said she understood all too well how important it was for some of her clients to look their best at tonight’s balls.

“This is the most important historical event in our entire life for some of us,” she said. “I understand that and want to make it right for people.”
717 2009-01-21 Mr. Teixeira was a software architect at Yahoo until Dec. 10, when the company laid off about 1,500 people. As documented in a series of slides leaked to the Silicon Valley blog Valleywag, managers were instructed to tell employees like Mr. Teixeira that “we’ve had to make some tough decisions around eliminating a number of positions.”

The script continues, “Your position is one of those being eliminated.”

After the conversation, Mr. Teixeira was led to a room, where he was met by a Right Management consultant, with two other terminated employees.

“The topics discussed were not very deep,” he said. “They give some very basic tips on what to do next. They answer any questions they can. It is all about moving on.”

The postlayoff session “allows the individual to vent,” Mr. Ayers said, “about their angst, their anger, their fear.”

It is a time to let off steam — and avoid what he called “bad and potentially disastrous behavior” — and figure out what to tell family members and friends. Outplacement advisers say the sessions lower the chance of public disputes, employee theft or even people harming themselves.

A day or two later, the employee will typically attend a seminar about résumé writing, job-search tools and applying for unemployment benefits. The outplacement consultants essentially act as a version of a high school or college career counselor.

The clinical language used in the Yahoo script is also typical. Within the third-party companies, a mass layoff is called a RIF, short for “reduction in force.” The termination day is the “day of notification,” and the initial meeting with a laid-off worker is a “pickup.” Consultants are careful to say that people are not eliminated, positions are eliminated. (Or, preferably, they are “made redundant.”)

But laid-off workers, of course, do take it personally. The third-party companies act as the “cleanup team” at the end of the layoff, said Alan Whitton, who had worked at Nortel for 20 years when he lost his job last August. “They deal with folks like me who knew it was coming and ask a couple of questions and bug out — and those who didn’t see it coming and are still in shock,” he said.

After being notified by phone of his termination, Mr. Whitton was walked through the severance package by a human resources worker, who then introduced him to the outplacement representative. He was asked about his feelings, handed a binder of information and asked to attend an orientation session the next day.

Several of these outplacement companies say that they are hiring to help companies lay off workers. Right Management’s overseas practice is adding staff in Austria, Poland, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. The Ayers Group, which employs about 30 people in the New York-New Jersey market, hired an additional consultant last month.

Until the last year, the layoffs in the wake of the 9/11 attacks were the worst that Mr. Ayers, who started his company in 1975, had seen. But the current layoffs have been “broader, wider and deeper,” he said.

The national unemployment rate rose sharply in the last year, to 7.2 percent in December, from 4.9 percent in January. The executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimates that corporations planned the layoffs of more than one million people during the year.

Ms. Varelas of Keystone Partners said the severity and the swiftness of the current economic crisis were similar to the banking crisis of the early 1990s. This time, though, “we’re much busier,” she said, “and partly that’s because career transition and outplacement has become a much more accepted benefit.”

She said a basic package of services for a departing employee, including a one-day seminar, can cost about $1,000.

When they are not dealing with mergers, acquisitions or layoffs, many of the career transition companies also offer executive coaching and other good-economy services. What worries them most, then, are so-called slack tide periods, when companies are neither hiring nor firing.

Mr. Teixeira says he believes the outplacement companies are here to stay. “Changing jobs is becoming the norm,” he said, citing his firsthand experience. In fact, when he was laid off from Yahoo last month, the Right Management consultant looked familiar. He had first met her a year ago, when he was laid off from his previous job.
718 2009-01-21 The health care products maker Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit rose 14 percent, topping Wall Street forecasts, but the company also said that it expected weaker results in 2009.

The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., earned $2.71 billion, or 97 cents a share, up from $2.37 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue fell 4.9 percent, to $15.18 billion, from $15.96 billion.

Excluding charges and gains, the company said it earned 94 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected profit of 92 cents a share on revenue of $15.93 billion. The one-time items included a $225 million after-tax gain from litigation settlements.

Looking ahead, Johnson & Johnson said it expected 2009 profit of $4.45 to $4.55 a share. Analysts expect profit of about $4.61 a share.

Johnson & Johnson noted, however, that the analysts estimate excludes the impact of acquiring the cosmetic product and breast implant maker Mentor Corporation, a deal expected to close in January that will dilute earnings by 3 to 5 cents. Johnson & Johnson included that impact in its forecasts.

The revenue drop, a rarity for Johnson & Johnson, was led by an 11 percent plunge in pharmaceutical sales, to $5.7 billion. That decline was partly a result of a 41.4 percent drop in sales of the antipsychotic Risperdal, which now has generic competition.

723 2009-01-22 Beginning next fall NBC will devote five hours of prime time every week to Jay Leno. To get in the habit of giving away precious space on its schedule, this Sunday and Monday the network is handing four hours to Robert Halmi Sr. and Jr., those tireless purveyors of synthetic Saturday matinee thrills, and their latest project, “The Last Templar.”

Mini-series are rare on the networks these days — the format has moved almost entirely to cable — but NBC is in the mood to throw just about anything against the wall; another mini-series, a “Bourne” clone called “XIII,” arrives in two weeks.

“The Last Templar,” like most products of the Halmi factory, is handsomely shot, offers some nice scenery (Morocco, standing in for Turkey) and has a bookish flavor. Unfortunately, it also possesses the true Halmi signature: despite the fact that it’s packed like a sausage with banter and jokes both verbal and visual, it doesn’t contain a single genuinely funny moment.

Mira Sorvino, as a sexy-single-mom archaeologist, and Scott Foley, as a sexy-guilty-Catholic F.B.I. agent, work hard to overcome the bland dialogue and flat-footed attempts at back story and personality quirks. Victor Garber is largely wasted as a monsignor with secrets.

The story, involving the Knights Templar, the Vatican, sunken treasure, the fate of Christianity and a decoding device that looks as if it came out of a really big box of medieval Cracker Jack, is the latest attempt to combine Indiana Jones derring-do with “Da Vinci Code” mysticism. (“Raiders of the Lost Ark” came out 28 years ago; “Romancing the Stone” came out 25 years ago; it’s time to admit that we can’t do better.) To hedge its bets, “Templar” throws in a dose of “The Perfect Storm” too.

If this sort of thing is just your cup of Darjeeling, then be sure to stick around for the fourth hour. You’ll be rewarded by the advent of Omar Sharif as a Mediterranean savant and all-purpose plot device who appears in the distance and scuttles toward us in a straight line across the sand. It’s a nod to Mr. Sharif’s thrilling, camel-borne entrance in “Lawrence of Arabia” and the closest thing that “Templar” has to a good joke.

NBC, Sunday and Monday nights at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.

Directed by Paolo Barzman; written by Suzette Couture, based on a novel and screenplay by Raymond Khoury; Robert Halmi Sr., Robert Halmi Jr. and Michael Prupas, executive producers; Irene Litinsky, producer; Sandrine Gros d’Aillon, supervising producer. Produced by Muse Entertainment Enterprises.

If the Obama administration grants the waiver, these states — and eventually three more that have indicated they would adopt the same policy — can begin enforcing emission standards that would eventually require automakers to put more fuel-efficient cars on the market. Together, the 17 states represent about half of the American auto market. Last year, the Bush administration, breaking with precedent, denied California the right to establish its own standards in the absence of any federal mandates. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his own separate letter to President Obama, urged him to direct the E.P.A. “to act promptly and favorably” on the request.

744 2009-01-22 WASHINGTON — Inaugural organizers fielded a flurry of complaints on Wednesday from people who had tickets to see President Obama’s swearing-in, but who were left stranded in an underground traffic tunnel near the Capitol.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional committee that handled the ticketing arrangements, said Wednesday that the Rules Committee would investigate the problems that kept thousands of ticket holders from seeing the event.

The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, in a statement on Wednesday, expressed regret that some ticket holders could not get to their sections, primarily in the standing-room area below the Capitol that was designated by the color purple and in the nearby blue zone.

Many people with tickets and even more who arrived without tickets, hoping to see the event from the Mall, endured long waits and frustrating delays in the subfreezing weather. But the purple-ticket holders appeared to have been abandoned by event organizers as they stood crowded, frustrated and cold in what some referred to as the Purple Tunnel of Doom in pictures posted on the Internet.

One purple-ticket holder who said he wanted an explanation and an apology was David Meyer, a Washington political consultant, who along with his girlfriend, missed the ceremonies as they stood in the tunnel for hours without any information.
745 2009-01-22 WASHINGTON — President Obama’s nominee for transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, answered many questions and dodged a few others at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday and was effectively approved by acclamation.

The chairman of the Commerce and Transportation Committee, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, interrupted the mostly softball questions after nearly two hours to say there was a deadline of 4 p.m. for committee approval of any nominee who was going to get Senate confirmation that day.

The ranking Republican member, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, gently corrected him, saying the deadline was 4:30 p.m.

“Being a realistic, responsible Republican here,” Ms. Hutchison said, to general laughter. But she said she would convey her approval to the Republican leadership.

In fact, Mr. Rockefeller cut the questioning short a few minutes later because the Senate was preparing to vote on the confirmation of Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state.
746 2009-01-22 The Supreme Court returned the case, Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee, No. 07-1125, to the lower courts to consider whether the parents can prove their claim under Section 1983. At the argument of the case last month, several justices expressed skepticism on that point.

The case involving the drug dealer, Afton Callahan, arose from a 2002 search of his home in Fillmore, Utah, by members of a police task force who did not have a warrant but relied on the fact that he had allowed a police informant posing as a customer to enter. A Utah appeals court threw out Mr. Callahan’s conviction, saying the “planned illegal entry” by the police had violated the Fourth Amendment.

Mr. Callahan then sued members of the task force under Section 1983, the same civil rights law at issue in the Massachusetts case. In response, the officers argued that they should be entitled to immunity from suit, a contention rejected by the federal appeals court in Denver.

The appeals court, in ruling that the officers had violated Mr. Callahan’s rights, drew a distinction between undercover police officers and informants. Had Mr. Callahan invited an undercover officer in, the court said, the search would have been authorized under a doctrine known as consent-once-removed. Informants are different, the court continued.

The appeals court then addressed the second question in the immunity analysis, whether the constitutional right in question had been clearly established at the time of the violation.

The court said the right to be free from unreasonable searches in one’s home was clearly established in 2002.

The Supreme Court reversed. The right in question was not the broad one identified by the appeals court, Justice Alito wrote. The Supreme Court looked instead to a series of lower court decisions that had accepted the consent-once-removed doctrine in various settings. In light of those decisions, the police officers were entitled to immunity even though the appeals court in their case had ruled that the doctrine did not apply to informants.

The decision, Pearson v. Callahan, No. 07-751, was also notable for refashioning the analysis to be used in deciding such questions of immunity.

A 2001 decision, Saucier v. Katz, had required lower courts to consider the two questions in immunity cases in a particular order. First, courts had to decide whether the official conduct violated the Constitution. Only then could courts consider whether the constitutional right in question was clearly established at the time of the violation.

That “rigid order of battle,” in the words of one appeals court, was unpopular with many lower court judges and some justices because it often forced courts to decide a hard question before an easy one. Wednesday’s decision made the Saucier rule discretionary rather than mandatory.

In the online pornography case, the court rebuffed the government’s request that it consider the constitutionality of a 1998 law for a third time. That law, the Child Online Protection Act, was a reaction to a Supreme Court decision striking down an earlier law meant to protect minors from sexual materials on the Internet. President Bill Clinton signed the new law in 1998, but it was promptly enjoined by Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr., a federal judge in Philadelphia.

In 2004, the Supreme Court affirmed the injunction by a vote of 5 to 4 and sent the case back for a trial to consider the effectiveness of filtering technologies. In March 2007, Judge Reed struck down the law, ruling that software filters are less restrictive and more effective than legal prohibitions.

But Judge Reed noted his “personal regret at having to set aside yet another attempt to protect our children from harmful material.” The federal appeals court in Philadelphia affirmed.

In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, Mukasey v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 08-565, the government said the lower courts’ decisions “would leave millions of children unprotected from the harmful effects of enormous amounts of pornography on the World Wide Web.” About half of households with children and Internet access do not use filters, the government’s brief said.
747 2009-01-22 Despite the fire, senators of both parties predicted Mr. Geithner would be confirmed. The Finance Committee will vote Thursday morning. The full Senate could vote next week, but Democrats said timing would depend on agreement from the Senate Republican leadership.

Mr. Geithner insisted his nonreporting of the payroll taxes on income from the I.M.F. from 2001 to 2004 were mistakes that were, in his words, careless and avoidable but unintentional. And he apologized to the senators “for putting you in the position of having to spend so much time on these issues when there is so much pressing business before the country.”

Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Finance Committee’s senior Republican, acknowledged the panel’s dilemma: He said Mr. Geithner, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has had a lead role in the past months’ financial rescue efforts, had “unique insight into how we have gotten to where we are today,” adding, “To some he isn’t merely the best choice; to some he is the only choice.”

“On the other hand,” Mr. Grassley said, “we need to consider how much the nominee’s tax history could reflect on a secretary of Treasury. As secretary the nominee would be in charge of the I.R.S.” Mr. Grassley has remained noncommittal.

Mr. Kyl, after the hearing, also chastised Mr. Geithner for extolling Mr. Obama’s proposed recovery plan, an $825 billion package of spending and tax cuts as drafted in the House. Mr. Kyl called the package “indefensible,” adding to new criticism on Wednesday among lawmakers of both parties after the Congressional Budget Office reported that much of the spending would not occur until after 2010, suggesting the package would do little to jumpstart the economy.

House Republicans, who grouse that Democrats excluded them from work on the stimulus package, asked for a meeting with Mr. Obama. Senior Congressional aides said he would meet with bipartisan leaders of Congress on Friday.

In the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Geithner shed little light on the Obama administration’s other plans for the economy but signaled a clear break from the Bush administration and the just-departed Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.

Mr. Geithner said the administration would soon propose overhauls of both the nation’s porous system for regulating financial institutions and the $700 billion financial bailout program. Among the changes, he said, the bailout fund would be tapped to address the housing foreclosure crisis more aggressively.

Mr. Geithner declined to endorse several specific ideas for changing the bailout program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, including one to acquire soured mortgage assets from banks and house them in a so-called bad bank.

“I don’t want to provide any specific details,” he said at one point, but confirmed that the bad bank concept was under consideration. To explain his reticence, Mr. Geithner alluded to the biggest criticism lodged against previous financial rescues in which he was a junior partner with Mr. Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke: that the government’s responses have zigzagged from one crisis to the next, which further rattled markets.

“We’ve seen the costs in terms of uncertainty created by tentative signals not followed up by clear actions, with not a lot of clarity on goals,” Mr. Geithner said. “And I don’t want to, today, be in the position of magnifying the basic problem.”

Mr. Geithner acknowledged that the decision to let Lehman Brothers fail in September, after bailing out other financial giants, “didn’t cause this crisis but it absolutely made things worse.” He insisted that Congress had not given the Fed or the Treasury the authority to provide the large amount of capital that Lehman needed to survive. He also said he and other officials had done all they could to find a buyer for Lehman, and to limit the fallout from its failure.

Several senators asked whether Mr. Geithner, who as New York Fed president is essentially Wall Street’s watchdog, could have seen warning signs earlier. To one, he conceded his own supervision “absolutely” could have been better. But he also said he had taken steps at the New York Fed to draw attention to hedge funds, credit default swaps and other exotic instruments that have gone unregulated, and to the need by regulators for new powers.

On both the financial bailout and the stimulus, Mr. Geithner said the government would have to invest much more before the economy revives. Saying timid action had worsened past crises, he added, “In a crisis of this magnitude, the most prudent course is the most forceful course.”

The $825 billion stimulus plan in the House meets the test, he said. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, disputed him, saying, “I don’t think the package is large enough.” While some Democrats agree with him, some Republicans are complaining the package is too large.

The Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also said the measure must be revised substantially, but to avoid expanding the government and permanently increasing spending.

The House Appropriations Committee voted, 35 to 22, to send a major component of the recovery package to the House for a final vote, perhaps next week.
748 2009-01-22 WASHINGTON  President Obama signed executive orders Thursday directing the Central Intelligence Agency to shut what remains of its network of secret prisons and ordering the closing of the Guantánamo detention camp within a year, government officials said.

The orders, which are the first steps in undoing detention policies of former President George W. Bush, rewrite American rules for the detention of terrorism suspects. They require an immediate review of the 245 detainees still held at the naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to determine if they should be transferred, released or prosecuted.

And the orders bring to an end a Central Intelligence Agency program that kept terrorism suspects in secret custody for months or years, a practice that has brought fierce criticism from foreign governments and human rights activists. They will also prohibit the C.I.A. from using coercive interrogation methods, requiring the agency to follow the same rules used by the military in interrogating terrorism suspects, government officials said.

But the orders leave unresolved complex questions surrounding the closing of the Guantánamo prison, including whether, where and how many of the detainees are to be prosecuted. They could also allow Mr. Obama to reinstate the C.I.A.’s detention and interrogation operations in the future, by presidential order, as some have argued would be appropriate if Osama bin Laden or another top-level leader of Al Qaeda were captured.

The new White House counsel, Gregory B. Craig, briefed lawmakers about some elements of the orders on Wednesday evening. A Congressional official who attended the session said Mr. Craig acknowledged concerns from intelligence officials that new restrictions on C.I.A. methods might be unwise and indicated that the White House might be open to allowing the use of methods other than the 19 techniques allowed for the military.

Details of the directive involving the C.I.A. were described by government officials who insisted on anonymity so they could not be blamed for pre-empting a White House announcement. Copies of the draft order on Guantánamo were provided by people who have consulted with Mr. Obama’s transition team and requested anonymity for the same reason.

In remarks prepared for delivery at his confirmation hearings to become director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, Dennis C. Blair, a retired admiral with a long background in intelligence, endorsed the new approach and promised to enforce it rigorously. It is not enough to set a standard and announce it, he said.

I believe strongly that torture is not moral, legal or effective, he told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Any program of detention and interrogation must comply with the Geneva Conventions, the Conventions on Torture, and the Constitution. There must be clear standards for humane treatment that apply to all agencies of U.S. Government, including the Intelligence Community, his written statement said.

As for closing Guantanamo, he said that would take time but must be done because it has become a damaging symbol to the world.

It is a rallying cry for terrorist recruitment and harmful to our national security, so closing it is important for our national security, Admiral Blairs statement said.

The guiding principles for closing the center should beprotecting our national security, respecting the Geneva Conventions and the rule of law, and respecting the existing institutions of justice in this country. I also believe we should revitalize efforts to transfer detainees to their countries of origin or other countries whenever that would be consistent with these principles. Closing this center and satisfying these principles will take time, and is the work of many departments and agencies.

The executive order on interrogations is certain to be received with some skepticism at the C.I.A., which for years has maintained that the military’s interrogation rules are insufficient to get information from senior Qaeda figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The Bush administration asserted that the harsh interrogation methods were instrumental in gaining valuable intelligence on Qaeda operations.

The intelligence agency built a network of secret prisons in 2002 to house and interrogate senior Qaeda figures captured overseas. The exact number of suspects to have moved through the prisons is unknown, although Michael V. Hayden, the departing director of the agency, has in the past put the number at “fewer than 100.”

The secret detentions brought international condemnation, and in September 2006, President Bush ordered that the remaining 14 detainees in C.I.A. custody be transferred to Guantánamo Bay and tried by military tribunals.

But Mr. Bush made clear then that he was not shutting down the C.I.A. detention system, and in the last two years, two Qaeda operatives are believed to have been detained in agency prisons for several months each before being sent to Guantánamo.

A government official said Mr. Obama’s order on the C.I.A. would still allow its officers abroad to temporarily detain terrorism suspects and transfer them to other agencies, but would no longer allow the agency to carry out long-term detentions.

Since the early days after the 2001 attacks, the intelligence agency’s role in detaining terrorism suspects has been significantly scaled back, as has the severity of interrogation methods the agency is permitted to use. The most controversial practice, the simulated drowning technique known as water-boarding, was used on three suspects but has not been used since 2003, C.I.A. officials said.

But at the urging of the Bush administration, Congress in 2006 authorized the agency to continue using harsher interrogation methods than those permitted for use by other agencies, including the military. Those exact methods remain classified. The order on Guantánamo says that the camp, which received its first hooded and chained detainees seven years ago this month, “shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than one year from the date of this order.”
749 2009-01-22 Even if you somehow missed the “Going Out of Business” and “Entire Store on Sale!” signs, it was hard to miss how many people were hurting. Almost everyone was struggling financially or knew someone who was.

Stacey Obsolu, a 19-year-old nurse, has one friend who was among the 55 workers at this Circuit City who would soon be out of work and another who is losing his job with the same chain in Manhattan.

Calder McKenzie made his living installing Circuit City’s televisions and other gear, four or five on a good day two or three years ago, two or three on a good day this Christmas season, none now. His wife is a senior lab technician at Westchester Medical Center who apparently has kept her job despite its recent announcement of 400 layoffs to help close a $70 million budget gap.

Paul Harry, a 51-year-old carpenter, painter and handyman from Stamford, went out on his own a few years back. For a while, he made a pretty good living. Then for another while he pretty much made his expenses. Now he’s lucky if he works one week on, two weeks off. The steady customers in Scarsdale who needed the fences touched up, the gutters cleaned, the table moved just so are too strapped to need his help. Some of his friends are finding work in Canada, working Monday through Friday, coming back on weekends. He’s doing his best to hang on.

“I hope he has some good brains with him, because he’s going to need them — and you, me and just about everybody,” he said of the new president. “I work for people who know a lot more about the markets than I do and they say it’s going to be at least three or four years before we get through this.”

Do we have that kind of patience? Maybe not. “I just worry that people are expecting too much; we want things solved now,” said Rob Jackson, an information-technology specialist with Sprint. “If people call me, they don’t want it fixed later this afternoon, they want it now, right away.”

Ms. Obsolu figured that what took eight years to break would take more than four to fix.

AND then maybe so. For some, the improbable miracle of the Obama presidency was its own reward, an affirmation of positive change that was its own gift, brain-dead economy or no brain-dead economy.

“That moment was enough,” said Liz Gibbs, a registered nurse from White Plains in a fake-fur coat adorned with an Obama sticker. “I mean it. For the first time, we have a president who I feel connected to, someone I can believe in. Besides the historic nature of the first African-American president, he has a genuineness that’s different than anything I can remember.”

And amid one failed emporium of gewgaws and gadgets, most people spoke of hope, of new beginnings, of shared burdens and playing their part, as if, for a while at least, they’re eager to buy into something not quite formed but full of promise.

On the marked-down televisions the preternatural single vision of the inauguration was gone and the hyperactive polyglot of American life returned — President Obama’s first full day; the hearings for Timothy F. Geithner, his nominee to be Treasury secretary; Allen Iverson’s abilities as a point guard; the latest on Britney; a port-a-potty-themed music video for “Country Man” by the Nashville singer Luke Bryan.
750 2009-01-22 Can you remember back when Hillary was first elected to the Senate eight years ago, and the Republican majority leader made the wistful suggestion that she might be hit by lightning before she was sworn in? Do you remember that just last year she was supposed to be the most divisive figure in American politics? Now, the Republicans can find only two people cranky enough to vote against putting her fourth in line of succession to the presidency.

Meanwhile, over in the Finance Committee, most of the senators seemed reluctant to poke too hard at Obama’s Treasury secretary nominee, , even though Geithner has a record of not having paid all his . The Republicans left most of the real complaining to people like of . Given the fact that Bunning claimed his last opponent looked “like one of ’s sons,” we were not expecting him to be an early harbinger of the new era.

“Tim has made some mistakes, which he has freely admitted and corrected,” said of New York. This is what Geithner’s supporters always say. It’s their defenses that make him sound really indefensible.

Despite the aid of a spiffy TurboTax program, Geithner neglected to pay and taxes for the years he was employed by the . When the audited his 2003 and 2004 returns and told him to hand over the money, it apparently did not occur to him that he had been working at the same job and paying taxes the same way in 2001 and 2002. It took a cabinet nomination to jog his memory.

Nevertheless, most of the senators seem to feel that Geithner is, in the words of , the Finance Committee’s ranking Republican, “not only the best choice,” but the only choice.

The idea that there’s only one man who can save the day in a time of great economic crisis is worrisome, given the number of indispensable financial giants who’ve turned out to be deeply dispensable on second look. (Let us pause to remember a presidential campaign past, in which McCain said that if , then the chairman, were to die, he should be propped up and kept on the job anyway.)

Perhaps there’s no time to start digging up a new Treasury secretary at this point. But we are starting the new era with the bar set surprisingly low.

In the House, Speaker has decided to leave Charles Rangel in charge of the tax-setting Ways and Means Committee during an ethics investigation of his incredibly sloppy personal finances. In defense, she points out that the House leadership does have standards, and that she kicked former Representative off Ways and Means after investigators found $90,000 in marked bills hidden inside his freezer. In the Senate, Schumer argues that Geithner’s errors “pale before the myriad mistakes made by the operators of financial institutions.”

Maybe we should have higher standards for our Treasury secretary than being better organized than . Really, we’re ready for a new era that looks a little ... newer.
751 2009-01-22 Rescuers were searching in choppy waters off the British Virgin Islands for at least 12 missing migrants whose flimsy boat collided with a reef and broke apart, the authorities said Wednesday. Rescuers said roughly 25 people, most of them Haitians, had been aboard an overloaded boat that was illegally traveling the 100-mile passage to the British Virgin Islands from the Dutch territory of St. Maarten. They were apparently island-hopping in hopes of eventually reaching United States shores when the boat hit a reef on Monday night, pitching passengers into the ocean. The police were struggling to identify 13 migrants who had been rescued by a passing fishing boat.
752 2009-01-22 The earnest opening ceremony televised on Sunday from the Lincoln Memorial, which HBO telecast free for cable and satellite viewers, was more than aware of the symbolism of Lincoln as emancipator and of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 March on Washington.

The chords and choirs of gospel music were used by Bruce Springsteen (with “The Rising”) and even the country singer Garth Brooks to sing about striving for better times. Stevie Wonder (with Usher and Shakira) sang his socially conscious “Higher Ground” at the Lincoln Memorial, then returned at the determinedly upbeat Neighborhood Ball, with an all-star singalong on his “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours.”

Song titles told the story at the Neighborhood Ball: Sting (with Mr. Wonder on harmonica) with “Brand New Day,” Shakira singing Van Morrison’s “Bright Side of the Road,” Mariah Carey with “Hero.”

Bill Clinton’s 1993 pre-inaugural concert showed his baby-boomer taste, for good and bad. Bob Dylan performed “Chimes of Freedom” on the Lincoln Memorial steps, followed two days later by an Inauguration Eve concert filled with presumably reassuring 1970s soft rock from Fleetwood Mac and Barry Manilow. Political differences offered George W. Bush less of a talent pool; Wayne Newton, the country duo Brooks & Dunn and the Latin pop singer Ricky Martin (who would later turn against Mr. Bush over the Iraq war) performed at his pre-inaugural event.

Stars who had shunned the politics of the Bush administration happily flocked to Washington for Mr. Obama’s inauguration. “Today is the beginning of no more separation, no more segregation!” Mary J. Blige exulted at the Neighborhood Ball before singing her own “Just Fine,” a song about hard-won self-esteem. (Two days earlier, at the Lincoln Memorial, she had poured emotion into Bill Withers’s comforting song “Lean On Me.”)

While it was a gospel and soul inauguration, it was also a hip-hop inauguration. Rappers who are charismatic, articulate, self-made successes may well see Mr. Obama as one of their own; he also gives them someone to boast about besides themselves.

Jay-Z, who performed his “History” at the Neighborhood Ball, also headlined a premium-priced concert on Monday night at the Warner Theater, a few blocks from the White House. Among his guests was Young Jeezy, who has a song called “My President Is Black”; Jay-Z added verses of his own: “My president is black/In fact he’s half white/So even in the racist mind/he’s half right.”

It continued, “My president is black/but his house is all white.”

The Youth Ball, an official inaugural event telecast on MTV, featured Kanye West — a Chicagoan, like Mr. Obama — who rewrote his song “Heartless” to pay tribute to the new president: “From miles around they came to see him speak/The story that he told/to save a country that’s so blue/that they thought had lost its soul/the American dream come true tonight.”

Other constituencies presented unofficial events, celebrating their new sense of inclusion and, perhaps, reminding the incoming administration of their clout and attention. There were musical celebrations from Chicago independent rockers, from the voter-registration group Rock the Vote and from the gay, lesbian and transgender voters of the Human Rights Campaign. At a Latino Inaugural Gala on Sunday night, more than a dozen legislators and two cabinet nominees turned out along with salsa, pop, mariachi and Latin rock bands to celebrate a Hispanic turnout that voted 2 to 1 for Mr. Obama, which provided the margin of victory in Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico.

In pop as in politics, self-promotion is never off the agenda. Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama were dancing in the front row at the Kids’ Inaugural on Monday, telecast on the Disney Channel, where Disney-nurtured stars of tween-pop including the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato sang their peppy hits about “burning up” and breaking up. With sublime shamelessness, Miley Cyrus looked at Mr. Obama’s daughters and said, “Girls, I know you guys must be awful proud of your dad, and so am I,” then brought her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, onstage to sing.

While the new president’s politics and identity were the overwhelming draws for so many musical celebrants — bringing out countless performances electrified by the moment — he also has a musical ace in the hole: his name.

The percussive “Barack” followed by the three open-voweled syllables of “Obama” give him the most singable name in presidential history, and from the National Mall to the inaugural balls, amateurs and stars alike kept finding new ways to chant, sing and shout it.
753 2009-01-22 A recession leads some to live more modestly. Of course, the economical approach isn’t adopted by all.

Take the new ThinkPad W700ds notebook from Lenovo. It comes with a 17-inch primary screen (1920-by-1200-pixel WUXGA resolution) and a second 10.6-inch retractable screen that can tilt up to 30 degrees.

The laptop’s options include an integrated color calibrator that adjusts the screen’s color, a built-in Wacom digitizer tablet, dual integrated hard drives, up to 960 gigabytes of total storage, a Blu-ray player, a seven-in-one multimedia reader and five U.S.B. ports.

The 700ds also features Wi-Fi as well as optional WiMax, dual fans for the central processing unit and the graphics processor, and an optional fingerprint reader.

The 11-pound ThinkPad W700ds is available now starting at $3,663. The company says it is aimed at oil and gas explorers, photographers, designers and other PC users who require high performance, but Lamborghini, Hummer and Harley-Davidson owners might also appreciate it. AZADEH ENSHA
754 2009-01-22 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — With demand for its chips drying up at record rates, Intel has decided to shut down several plants and dismiss thousands of workers.

Fresh off one of its worst quarters in the last 25 years, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., told investors after the market’s close on Wednesday that it would lay off at least 5,000 people.

The cuts result from the closing of three chip-testing facilities in Asia and halting operations at plants in Oregon and California. The closed facilities mostly used aging technology, and Intel will continue to invest billions of dollars this year in new plants, said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman.

As many as 6,000 people could be dismissed, depending on how many workers can secure jobs at other Intel plants. Intel employed 84,000 people at the end of last year, and had already eliminated 20,000 jobs in the last three years.

According to some analysts, the company has exhibited a focus on cost-cutting and decisive, sometimes painful action under the leadership of its chief executive, Paul S. Otellini.
755 2009-01-22 SAN FRANCISCO  Amid a deepening recession and an intensifying controversy over the health of its chief executive, Apple reported strong first-quarter profits on Wednesday that surprised analysts and handily beat Wall Street’s expectations.

Apple said robust sales of iPods and laptops buoyed the company amid a terrible holiday shopping season that hurt nearly all other technology and consumer electronics firms.

Apple said its quarterly profit jumped to $1.61 billion, or $1.78 a share, from $1.58 billion, or $1.76 a share, a year earlier.

Revenue increased to $10.17 billion, from $7.9 billion. Analysts had expected Apple to announce revenue of $9.74 billion and profit of $1.39 a share.

The news sent Apple’s stock up more than 9 percent to $90.70 in after-hours trading.

“Where many of the other consumer-facing companies are missing their expectations and seeing their revenues decline, Apple continues to see growth,” said David Bailey, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. “It is gaining market share in every category and, given the premium price of their products, that is a significant achievement.”

The earnings news came on a day when reports circulated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Apple for inconsistent disclosures about the health of Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Jobs said he was suffering from an easily treatable “hormone imbalance,” and Apple’s stock briefly jumped. Mr. Jobs reversed course a week later and said he was taking a six-month leave of absence because his condition was “more complex” than previously thought.

Spokesmen for Apple and the S.E.C. declined to discuss the possibility of an inquiry into the company’s disclosures, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.

The earnings report presented a picture that was largely at odds with pessimistic speculation about Mr. Jobs’s health, and with the company’s declining stock price. Before the earnings report, Apple shares reached a two-year low on concerns that the economy was hurting its prospects, and on fears that Mr. Jobs’s absence might become permanent.

Apple said it sold 4.36 million iPhone 3Gs in its holiday quarter, down from 6.9 million phones during the fall quarter, when the 3G version was released. However, that is nearly double the 2.3 million iPhones that were sold in the year-ago quarter.

Apple also said it had sold 2.5 million Macs, up from 2.3 million in the quarter a year earlier, largely on the strength of its MacBook notebooks, which the company updated in October. Apple is posting those gains at a time when the overall market for personal computers is contracting.

IPod sales jumped a healthy 3 percent from a year ago, to 22.7 million, driven largely by consumers in Europe and Asia.

Apple enjoys higher margins than many of its competitors because it can charge a premium for devices that consumers view as more glamorous and better designed. Apple said its gross profit margin last quarter was 34.7 percent, unchanged from a year ago. The company benefited from falling prices for components like memory chips.

Apple, which is notoriously conservative with its predictions of future earnings, easily exceeded its own forecast for the quarter. But it cautioned on Wednesday that the results for the current quarter would reflect some slowness, projecting profits of 90 cents to $1 a share and sales of $7.6 billion to $8 billion.

Some analysts and shareholders say the future remains cloudy for Apple, particularly in light of the absence of Mr. Jobs. Speaking in a conference call with analysts, the company’s chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, who is filling in for Mr. Jobs during his leave, sought to allay those concerns.

“There is extraordinary breadth and depth and tenure among the Apple executive team, and they lead 35,000 employees that I would call wicked smart,” Mr. Cook said. “We believe we were put on the face of the earth to make great products, and that is not changing.”

Mr. Cook also appeared to fire a shot across the bow of Palm, the Silicon Valley cellphone maker that recently unveiled the Pre, a smartphone with some of the same touch-screen tricks as the iPhone.

Though he declined to specifically mention any company, Mr. Cook said that Apple would not stand for having its intellectual property “ripped off,” and that “we’ll use whatever weapons we have at our disposal.”

Palm’s executive chairman is Jonathan J. Rubinstein, who was instrumental in creating the iPod and left Apple in 2006. The company has hired several other former Apple employees.
756 2009-01-22 He uses 2,200 gallons of gas a year driving his truck all over Cape Cod, and with the recent fall in prices at the pump, he has cut his prices 10 percent. He plans to continue spending more than $20,000 on Yellow Pages display ads for his company, A to Z Animal and Pest Control, in Mashpee, Mass., but he said he would reduce his service area to save on gas.

Stock trading, though, is his real passion. He made a lot of money in the dot-com boom, lost most of it, then got back into the market a few years ago after figuring that he could make more money shorting stocks than buying long.

“Look at the charts,” said Mr. Davis, who is 46. “Stocks always go down a lot quicker than they go up. That’s because of the market makers.” In two weeks recently, he said, he made $10,000 doing “a double short and a double long on oil.” As he drives from job to job, he listens to financial news on CNBC and checks the markets on the laptop that occupies the passenger seat. He even takes breaks from setting traps in attics to return to his van to find out what is happening on Wall Street.

The second of the five is Stephen Sullivan, 56, who spends more than 50 weeks a year staying in the homes of well-heeled residents to care for their dogs, cats, birds and even wild swans while they flee south or go on cruises. He says he does not care how much money he makes. Even so, business at his company, Feathers and Fur, in Dennis, Mass., is up from last year.

“People who put their heart into their work always have work,” he said.

“People call me the St. Francis of Cape Cod,” he added. “I love animals. I love moving from house to house. It’s like going on vacation.”

Ron Landry has reactivated his R. E. Landry Construction Company in Forestdale, Mass., after taking 10 months off in late 2007 and early 2008 to work for another contractor and start a judo club. He is remodeling a basement, a $40,000 job that he says should take two and a half months and earn him $22,000. “I’m not booked out for two years like I used to be,” Mr. Landry said. “But my ace in the hole is that I can do just about anything, I do what I say I’m going to do and I’m not afraid of hard work.”

He has also invested in real estate, deriving about $20,000 a year in rental income from a lakefront home in New Hampshire and a condominium in Florida. He also owns three Florida lots that cost him $72,700, peaked in value at $313,000 and now might be worth $115,000, by his calculations. “I’m still ahead,” he said.

His greatest ardor, however, is reserved for judo. He has a third-degree black belt in the martial art and his 11-year-old son is a national champion. Mr. Landry started Cape Cod Mat Sports in Mashpee in June 2007 after years of coaching young people in his church free. It recently turned profitable, he said, and he plans to expand into wrestling and to begin a big marketing drive soon.

“I’d love to do this full time,” said Mr. Landry, 46. And the recession actually helps, he said. “All you need to buy in judo is a practice uniform for $45. A good baseball bat costs $150. Also, I think our country is shifting back to the basics of a more structured, disciplined way of life, which judo exemplifies.”

Symen Kooy, owner of Blossoms Florist and Gifts in Dennis, Mass., says his venture is flourishing in the recession as never before. Blossoms made 750 deliveries on Mother’s Day last year, up from 100 the first year, and made 200 deliveries on Christmas, double the 2007 volume. He expects 2009 revenue to grow 25 percent, even though customers are placing smaller orders.

He attributes his success to “giving better service than people expect” and to his lifelong love affair with flowers. “After all, I’m Dutch,” said Mr. Kooy, 72. “Dad won big prizes for his gladiolas. My brother had the largest garden store in Holland.”

Even Ellen R. Massa, who took out a second mortgage on her house two years ago to start Professional Nurse and Home Care of Cape Cod, and who today is struggling to keep it afloat, is hopeful. The souring economy, competition from national chains and caregivers who work off the books, and state taxes are driving her to distraction, she said. “Payroll taxes, the business tax, workmen’s comp, liability taxes, unemployment taxes, a new insurance tax — do you want me to keep naming them?” she asked.

And yet, Mrs. Massa, 53, said, “I’m cautiously optimistic. I’m making enough to get by. I’m not giving up. This has always been a dream of mine. I won’t go back to punching a clock.”

Even with a sour economy, then, entrepreneurs’ can-do spirit keeps burning. A recent survey of its members by the National Federation of Independent Business showed that pessimists about the economy outnumbered optimists by just 5 percentage points in the last quarter of 2008, shrinking from a 20 percent gap in the first quarter.

Why the rebound? “Entrepreneurs are by definition more creative and more resilient than big companies,” said Michael Alter, SurePayroll’s president. “They’ve been struggling with the economic downturn since September, and now they’ve figured out ways to deal with it.”
757 2009-01-22 SYDNEY (Reuters) — BHP Billiton, the mining company, said on Wednesday that it would cut 6,000 jobs and close its giant Ravensthorpe nickel mine in Australia, writing off $1.6 billion, as it battles a collapse in commodity prices.

Until now BHP, the world’s largest miner, had set itself apart by maintaining production and just last month said sales volumes were holding up despite a global downturn.

But as it became increasingly apparent there would be no quick fix to the slump in commodity prices, BHP was forced to do what it had long resisted — close mines and cut jobs.

“Clearly their balance sheet is in a respectable position. But they are not immune from the commodity price environment that we’re seeing, and earnings are going to suffer,” said Neil Boyd-Clark, managing partner at Fortis Investment Partners.

The chief financial officer, Alex Vanselow, warned on Wednesday that more mines could be closed given the uncertainty in commodity markets. The Australian metallurgical coal mines are already slated to reduce output by 10 to 15 percent.
758 2009-01-22 In a statement, the newspaper’s owners described the price as “a nominal sum,” said by analysts to be £1, or about $1.40. The Standard has a circulation of more than 280,000 copies a day and losses estimated by analysts at up to $22 million a year.

Many foreigners have bought into the British press, including Conrad Black, a Canadian, and Rupert Murdoch, an Australian who later became an American.

But this latest acquisition has a particular flavor for a city in thrall to its super-rich Russian elite.

There is, for instance, Roman A. Abramovich, one of Russia’s richest men, who owns the Chelsea soccer club as well as yachts and luxury homes. With overtones of le Carré, there are anti-Kremlin dissidents like Boris A. Berezovsky, whose former aide, Alexander V. Litvinenko, himself a former K.G.B. officer, was killed by a rare radioactive toxin in London in November 2006.

According to the Russian Embassy, about 300,000 Russians lived in London in 2008, including a sprinkling of billionaires and many millionaires, drawn by favorable tax laws at least until the financial crisis hit home. Mr. Lebedev is by no means the only former Soviet spy attracted to Britain: former agents like Viktor Suvorov and Oleg Gordievsky defected to Britain during the cold war.

Yet the fact that Moscow-based Mr. Lebedev is presumably the first former Soviet spy to own a major British daily “adds a different dimension,” said Roy Greenslade, who writes a column on the media in The Standard and a blog about it on the Web site of The Guardian. “What you always have to ask yourself is, ‘Why is this person buying the paper?’ ” Mr. Greenslade said in a telephone interview.

“There are five reasons for owning newspapers, and all begin with a P: profit, propaganda, political influence, prestige and public service. There’s no profit in The Standard, so you’ve got to look at the other things.”

In Moscow, Mr. Lebedev is the major shareholder, along with the former Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper that has a reputation for being pro-democracy and independent and whose journalists included Anna Politkovskaya, who was killed in Moscow in October 2006. A freelance journalist for the paper, Anastasia Baburova, was killed on Monday in Moscow.

Mr. Lebedev, a political gadfly, has built a reputation for opposing corruption and seeking stronger democratic institutions, even though, like Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, his roots go back to the cold war K.G.B.

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Lebedev promised to guarantee The Standard’s editorial independence. “We are strong supporters of a free and independent press and we greatly admire The Evening Standard as an iconic publication with its pedigree of fine journalism and commentary,” the statement said.

Mr. Lebedev, 49, is to be the chairman of a new company that will own the paper. His London-based son, Evgeny Lebedev, 28, will be senior executive director.

Mr. Lebedev has sought a different profile in London, as a host of glittering events in honor of the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation, which seeks to combat cancer in children. The parties were partly organized by Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, a society magazine, who once remarked that the events “reinvented the way British society looked at Russians in the U.K.”
759 2009-01-22 Wall Street bounded back on Wednesday as investors hunted for bargains among battered financial stocks and cheered the prospect that Timothy F. Geithner would be confirmed as President Obama’s Treasury secretary.

A day after the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 330 points and financial stocks posted their worst single-day drop in years, the banking sector pulled the broader indexes back up. Despite continuing concerns, big banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase recouped some of their losses.

The Dow sustained a rally most of the day and ended up 279.01 points, or 3.5 percent, to 8,228.10. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was 4.3 percent, or 35.02 points, higher at 840.24. The Nasdaq finished up 4.6 percent, at 1,507.07.

“The markets are searching for any kind of solace,” said Tim Smalls, head of trading at Execution in Greenwich, Conn. “The key to getting everything moving again was the Geithner hearing.”

In Washington, Mr. Geithner told a Senate panel that the Obama administration would propose new regulations for the financial system and called for reform of the $700 billion financial bailout. He also apologized for the mistakes he had made related to paying $34,000 in income taxes late several years ago.

780 2009-01-23 Ticket holders who never made it to President Obama’s inauguration are going to get a consolation prize. Thousands of people who had tickets to the swearing in were not allowed to enter the Mall and instead were stranded in a tunnel near the Capitol or at other security checkpoints. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies said that those people would receive copies of the swearing-in invitation and program, photographs of Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and a color print of the ceremony. A committee spokeswoman, Carole Florman, said people should check the committee’s Web site, inaugural.senate.gov, early next week for instructions on now to claim the items.
781 2009-01-23 A new poll suggests that Americans, preoccupied with the economy, are less worried about rising global temperatures than they were a year ago but remain concerned with solving the nation’s energy problems.

The findings are somewhat at odds with President Obama, who has put a high priority on staving off global warming and vowed Tuesday in his Inaugural Address to “roll back the specter of a warming planet.”

In the poll, released Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, global warming came in last among 20 voter concerns; it trailed issues like addressing moral decline and decreasing the influence of lobbyists. Only 30 percent of the voters deemed global warming to be “a top priority,” compared with 35 percent in 2008.

“Protecting the environment,” which had surged in the rankings from 2006 to 2008, dropped even more precipitously in the poll: only 41 percent of voters called it a top priority, compared with 56 percent last year.

In contrast, dealing with the nation’s energy problems ranked sixth in the poll  just behind education and social security  with 60 percent of voters endorsing it as a top priority.

The declining interest in global warming and other environmental issues might be unsurprising at a time when Americans face far more imminent threats to their jobs and homes. “Strengthening the nation’s economy” was the top-ranked concern of voters in the Pew poll. A relatively cool year and a harsh winter in North America and Europe have not helped, inspiring some commentators and a small cluster of scientists to make skeptical remarks about “global cooling.”

Social scientists say that environmental concerns are often the first to fall off the table when any more immediate threat surfaces. Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center, said a similar pattern was seen in the Pew poll after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when second-tier issues faded in voters’ minds.

“Concern for terrorism overshadowed all else,” Mr. Kohut said.

The public’s waning interest in global warming poses a challenge for Mr. Obama, who emphasized climate change throughout his campaign and pledged to seek a cap on emissions in the United States of heat-trapping gases, led by carbon dioxide, which come mainly from burning coal and oil. Such a cap, even if it includes various mechanisms intended to ease the cost, would by design raise the price of energy coming from those fossil fuels, which still underpin the American and the global economies.

Mr. Obama’s political foes have already seized on the cooling of public concern.

Marc Morano, the communications director for the Republican minority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has been sending out e-mail alerts, sometimes several a day, highlighting stories on winter weather and other surveys suggesting a shift in public attitudes.

But some experts in climate and energy policy say, given Americans’ continuing concern about filling their gas tanks and lighting their homes, Mr. Obama might still succeed in shoring up public support by packaging his climate policy as part of a larger push for a safer, cleaner menu of energy choices.

“Obama can effectively tie conservation, efficiency and renewable energy to jobs, sustainable growth and national security,” said Riley E. Dunlap, a sociologist at Oklahoma State University who studies public and political discourse on climate.

“This will be easier with energy efficiency and independence than with climate change,” Dr. Dunlap said. But, he said, “I think he can ‘legitimate’ climate change and the need to act on it to a considerable degree.”

Richard C. J. Somerville, a climate scientist at the University of California, San Diego, said there was plenty of evidence that a sustained push on improved energy technology and energy efficiency, including public education by scientists and political leaders, could pay off politically and environmentally.

“France, a country of 60 million people, went from near zero to 80 percent nuclear electricity in about three decades,” Dr. Somerville said. The shift, he added, “was done smoothly and effectively, and public education was a big part of it.”

David Goldston, a former chief of staff of the House science committee, noted that no American president had previously made global warming a central issue, “so we don’t know what will happen when that occurs.”

“We’ll see,” Mr. Goldston added, “but I think it’s wrong to assume too much about the future based on our current prolonged torpor.”
782 2009-01-23 For the nation’s grocery shoppers, the list of foods that might contain salmonella-tainted peanut butter has grown so quickly that keeping up seems daunting.

There are boxes of Valentine’s candy, frozen cookie dough and dog biscuits, chicken satay, peanut butter cups and stuffed celery.

Many of the products are sold as supermarket brands or under lesser-known national labels, but the list also has some of the more popular snacks on the shelf, like Little Debbie sandwich crackers, Famous Amos cookies and energy snacks from Clif Bar and NutriSystems.

The Food and Drug Administration has listed almost 130 products that have been recalled, but federal officials say the list is likely to grow as the investigation continues.

The large and varied list of products points up the many layers involved in producing packaged foods.

“I don’t think we can determine how many more” products will be recalled, Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the food and drug agency, told reporters on Wednesday.

Out of 486 cases of salmonella illness reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6 people have died and 107 have been hospitalized. The most recent person sickened fell ill on Jan 8. Since it takes up to three weeks for cases to be reported to the disease agency, more are expected.

Consumers who have packages of food made with peanut products should check with the manufacturer by Web site or telephone and consult the F.D.A. recall list at fda.gov. Anyone who is not sure about a product should not eat it, federal officials said.

The disease agency asked on Thursday that the military instruct its personnel to carefully inspect care packages from home. Peanut butter in jars that is sold in stores, however, is not considered to be a risk, the F.D.A. has said.

Investigators tracked the salmonella outbreak to the Peanut Corporation of America, a factory in Blakely, Ga., that makes peanut butter and peanut paste. It sells to institutions like schools and nursing homes and to other companies, like Kellogg’s, which turns the butter or paste into products like peanut-butter-filled crackers. Since last week, Kellogg’s has recalled at least seven million cases of food. The Peanut Corporation of America has recalled all of its products produced since July 1.

Investigators linked the plant to the outbreak after tracing the salmonella found in two tainted samples, one an open container of peanut butter from a Minnesota nursing home and the other from an unopened container at a Connecticut school.

Both were labeled King Nut, an institutional brand produced by the Georgia company. Both samples genetically match Salmonella typhimurium, the strain of salmonella associated with the outbreak, food agency officials said.

The plant, which is closed, packed peanut butter in bulk ranging from 5 to 1,700 pounds, much of which was shipped to institutions. Many school districts have pulled peanut butter from menus, with some substituting more commonly recognized supermarket brands. New York City school officials said they had not bought any peanut butter or products with ingredients that originated at the Georgia plant.

The plant also produced peanut paste, a more concentrated product used in candy, crackers and many other kinds of foods. Tracking how the paste travels through the food supply can be challenging, because several companies can be involved in making the final food. For example, one manufacturer might coat the paste in chocolate and make a peanut butter cup, which is then sold to another company that mixes it into ice cream that may or may not also contain peanut butter. A grocery chain might buy that ice cream and sell it under a private label.

Volume, wide distribution and a complicated supply chain are not the only issues. Salmonella can survive for a long time in a closed container of peanut butter.

“The piece that hasn’t come out yet is that peanut butter isn’t like spinach or ground beef because it has a really long shelf life,” said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Ms. DeWaal and other critics of the federal food safety system said that because peanut butter was considered a low risk for contamination, plants could sometimes go without inspection for a decade.

Although no one has figured out how salmonella, which is commonly found in the feces of mammals and birds, could end up in the peanut butter, it most likely happened after the nuts were roasted, a step that produces temperatures high enough to kill the pathogen.

While investigators try to determine how widespread the contamination might be, food companies like Hershey’s and Kraft, which say they do not use the Georgia company’s products, scrambled to get the word out that their Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and Nutter Butter cookies were safe.

So did the Girl Scout organization, which has about two-thirds of its 2.4 million scouts out selling cookies including peanut butter patties and the long-popular peanut butter sandwich cookie. The Girl Scouts’ cookie bakers have tested their products and do not buy from the Georgia company.
783 2009-01-23 As the region struggles economically along with the rest of the nation, the declining quality of its air threatens to undermine central aspects of its formula for economic growth. The Treasure Valley’s sales pitch has long been that it is a quiet, clean and less restrictive place to live and do business.

The population of the Treasure Valley has doubled, to more than 600,000 people, over the last two decades, growth built largely on the region’s combination of sun, mountains and semirural appeal. Along with the people, however, has come traffic congestion, particularly on the region’s sole expressway, Interstate 84, which links Boise to suburbs like Caldwell and Nampa that border dusty ranch land and sagebrush.

Auto emissions have risen, as has pollution from the increased business activity. In turn, the region’s distinctive weather patterns, called inversions, often trap polluted air in the valley.

Faced with the prospect of expensive and unwanted federal regulations, some local leaders, including conservatives not typically drawn to environmental issues, are exploring unconventional ways to keep the federal government at arm’s length by getting cars off the road.

The suburb of Nampa is considering letting city employees move to a four-day workweek. Caldwell recently adopted a policy requiring city employees to scrape ice from windows rather than let city vehicles idle to warm up. Employees also are encouraged to walk on city errands.

The initial goal of some of these policies was to reduce fuel costs, but now that gas prices have come back down, emissions must still be addressed, officials said.

“We don’t want a yellow alert permeating the news and drawing attention,” said David J. Ferdinand, chairman of the county commission in Canyon County, referring to a layer of smog that had settled over the Treasure Valley on a recent winter weekday.

East of Canyon County, in more liberal Boise, local officials are considering a streetcar line downtown, and there is talk of one day converting a rail freight line for commuter use.

The relationship between traffic and the region’s struggle to control ozone crystallized last summer, when gas prices were more than $4 a gallon. People suddenly began leaving their cars at home, choosing instead to use the region’s limited bus system and, in the process, shrink the number of so-called vehicle miles traveled by as much as a 9 percent. That, coupled with favorable weather, led to notably lower ozone levels than the summer before.

“We went from a year that was terrible to a year that was great, and the only variables were weather and vehicle miles traveled,” said Leonard Herr, the air program manager for the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.

Along with this apparent evidence that driving less really can improve air quality, a change in state law has also added pressure on the region to change. The measure, passed last spring, requires local governments in the Treasure Valley to have vehicle emissions testing or find other ways to reduce auto emissions. More than a decade ago, the federal government began requiring Ada County to test auto emissions. Ada County officials have urged their more conservative and less affluent counterparts in Canyon County to join them, but local residents there largely oppose testing.

“They think it’s government interference,” said Mr. Hurst, the bus rider from Caldwell. “They feel like they still live in the country and that they don’t have pollution.”

Given the public resistance to emissions testing, Canyon County leaders are hoping to cut emissions through efforts like the four-day workweek proposed in Nampa, promoting no-idling policies or perhaps requiring the trapping of fuel vapors at gas stations.

Canyon County is not alone in its skepticism. Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican, made no mention of public transportation in his lengthy discussion of transportation challenges during his State of the State address this month.

And the Republican-controlled Legislature, where rural, antigovernment interests have strong influence, has so far refused to give growing cities like Boise and its suburbs the power to impose special taxes, common in other states, to raise money for things like public transportation.

Whether the Legislature eventually shifts its position or not, experts say the Treasure Valley must change its habits if it hopes to hold on to its distinctive appeal in the changing West.

"Idaho’s always considered itself very rural," said Mr. Herr, the state air quality official, "and we found out we’re not."
784 2009-01-23 In “Gay but Equal?” (Op-Ed, Jan. 16), Mary Frances Berry argues that the United States Commission on Civil Rights should be abolished and replaced with “a new commission” addressing “the rights of many groups, including gays.”

Ms. Berry’s concern is not with the commission’s lack of jurisdiction over sexual orientation issues, which could be remedied by statutory amendment. Rather, her grievance is that the commission has a conservative majority and will retain that majority until 2010, when President Obama is scheduled to make his first appointments.

During Ms. Berry’s tumultuous tenure as commission chairwoman, the Government Accountability Office called it “an agency in disarray,” which lacked “basic management controls.”

In contrast, today it has received three consecutive clean audits, substantially increased the quality and integrity of its reports and has been taken seriously again as an independent civil rights watchdog.

We trust that President Obama will not look to Ms. Berry for advice on the commission.

The writers are, respectively, vice chairwoman and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.
785 2009-01-23 WITHIN his first 100 days, President Obama will attend his inaugural global summit meeting: an April gathering of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in London. The president, with bipartisan backing in Congress, should send an audacious signal of hope. Starting with the United States, Mr. Obama should call for each developed country to pledge 0.7 percent of its stimulus package to a vulnerability fund for assisting developing countries that can’t afford bailouts and deficits.

The United States could begin by pledging some $6 billion of its own $825 billion stimulus package — just 4 percent of what was provided to American International Group. With this modest step, the United States would speed up global recovery, help the world’s poor and bolster its foreign policy influence.

There is no time to waste. The economic crisis has already pushed an estimated 100 million people back into poverty. Slumping exports have helped imperil the jobs of workers around the world. In many places foreign and domestic investment is frozen. So far we have avoided the currency collapses of 1997 and 1998, but 2009 will be a dangerous year.

The good news is that if Mr. Obama sends the right signal, many countries are likely to contribute to a vulnerability fund. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has expressed interest in the idea. Last year President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for an increase in aid, and has taken a particular interest in Africa. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants to help finance construction projects in poor countries.

Japan has already pledged to help the World Bank recapitalize banks in poor countries. Australia and Russia have supported a food vulnerability fund that we created last year. Canada has been increasing its aid; the European Commission has been debating over contributing more assistance. Last year, Saudi Arabia gave an emergency $500 million grant to the World Food Program.

Italy, as the host of the Group of 8 industrialized nations finance ministers’ meeting next month, should pave the way for the Group of 20 meeting by making the drive for a vulnerability fund a priority. The World Bank, with the United Nations and regional development banks, could then manage the fund to facilitate fast and flexible aid delivery, backed by safeguards to ensure that the money is well spent.
786 2009-01-23 Underscoring the potentially tangled lines of authority, Mrs. Clinton said that the National Security Council, led by Gen. James L. Jones, would play a coordinating role on Afghanistan and Pakistan. She emphasized unity, saying, “We want to send a clear and unequivocal message: we are a team.”

Already, though, there is some jockeying over whether the State Department or the White House will dominate foreign policy — with the first skirmishes playing out in the titles given to the emissaries.

Both Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Holbrooke will report to Mrs. Clinton, and through her, to Mr. Obama, according to a State Department spokesman. But as if to dramatize the murkiness of the arrangement, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who accompanied Mr. Obama to the State Department, seemed confused at one point about whether the new president or the new secretary of state would introduce the emissaries. (It was Mrs. Clinton.)

As a special envoy, the State Department spokesman said, Mr. Mitchell will have a more traditional role, working out of the State Department. As a special representative, administration officials said, Mr. Holbrooke will have the freedom to roam — and to represent Mr. Obama, the National Security Council and even the Pentagon.

Mr. Holbrooke and General Jones, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, wanted Mr. Holbrooke to be able to speak directly to the White House, an official said. General Jones once led NATO’s Supreme Allied Command in Afghanistan and plans to be deeply involved in Afghan policy.

With the United States about to deploy 30,000 more troops there, policymaking on Afghanistan is as much about the military as about diplomacy, officials said, so Mr. Holbrooke will have to cut across departments.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden visited the State Department hours after Mrs. Clinton arrived for her first day of work there. She received a hero’s welcome from more than a thousand State Department employees, who whooped and cheered as if it were a campaign rally.

“This is going to be a great adventure,” Mrs. Clinton said to employees in a lively 10-minute address, with people craning to see her from a balcony in the flag-lined lobby of the State Department.

“I will do all that I can, working with you, to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America’s future,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Mr. Obama made the same point in his speech to senior and midlevel diplomats in the ornate Benjamin Franklin room. And he went out of his way to praise his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. “I’ve given you an early gift: Hillary Clinton,” he said, to noisy applause.

The State Department has been demoralized by a lack of resources and the primacy of the Pentagon in overseas operations. Among the crowd gathered to greet Mrs. Clinton, there was a palpable hope that the department finally had a forceful advocate. Her arrival — she was bathed in flashbulbs and mobbed by outstretched hands — was more suited to a celebrity than a government official.

“The employees are ecstatic that we now have a secretary of state who is going to fight for the resources we need,” said John Naland, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, the professional association and labor union representing career diplomats. “For three years, there were almost no requests for additional staffing and resources.”

To bolster the department’s fund-raising efforts on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Clinton has named Jacob J. Lew, a former budget director in the Clinton administration, as one of two deputies. The other deputy is James B. Steinberg, a deputy national security adviser to President Clinton. Both appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday for their confirmation hearings.

While Mr. Obama’s remarks on the Middle East did not break new ground, his reference to the plight of Palestinians suggested that his administration might strive for a more evenhanded tone.

“Our hearts go out to the Palestinian civilians who are in need of food, clean water and basic medical care,” he said, noting that the blocking of border crossings in Gaza had deepened their misery.

Mr. Mitchell, 75, said his experience in Northern Ireland, where sectarian conflict raged for centuries, had prepared him for the grueling work of a Middle East peace negotiator. “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success,” he said.

Mr. Holbrooke, 67, who spoke of his roots as a junior diplomat, offered no details about future policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But he demonstrated his assertive personal style, saying he would coordinate “what is clearly a chaotic foreign assistance program” in Afghanistan.

Foreign-policy analysts uniformly praised both men, but some said Mrs. Clinton would need to assert her authority.

“There’s no precedent for a secretary of state to subcontract two incredibly high-profile and politically resonant issues so early in her tenure,” said Aaron David Miller, an analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “That could create a management problem.”
787 2009-01-23 WASHINGTON — A Senate panel on Thursday postponed a vote to confirm President Obama’s pick for deputy secretary of defense because the nominee’s previous lobbying work violated the new administration’s ethics rules.

Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, did not rule out confirmation of the nominee, William J. Lynn III.

Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, noted Thursday that the rules included provisions for waivers in a case of public interest.

In a statement, Mr. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said his committee would wait to see “whether a waiver will be forthcoming and what the scope of the waiver will be.”

Mr. Obama’s ethics rules bar former lobbyists in his administration for two years from working on issues about which they had lobbied or in agencies that they had lobbied. But the administration has acknowledged that two of its nominees violate the code. One is Mr. Lynn, picked to oversee military spending, who has been a lobbyist for the military contractor Raytheon.

789 2009-01-23 Now in its 55th year, the Winter Antiques Show delivers, in density and extent, an experience akin to a visit to a small museum, albeit one in which the selection and arrangement of the objects remains mysteriously unaccountable. While the accent is on 18th- and 19th-century Americana, variety abounds: there is Asian art; glass; rugs; Egyptian, Roman and Greek antiquities; jewelry; ceramics; paintings; photography; silverware; folk art; prints; rare books — some 10,000 items in all.

Indeed, the 75 booths assembled by dealers from the United States and Europe at the Park Avenue Armory are loaded with beautiful, exotic, rare and odd objects from so many different times and places that it is difficult to know how or where to begin. I advocate grazing: walking the aisles and allowing your eyes to snack on the widest possible variety of objects.

Aside from the wares, the booths are a hoot. Several are furnished interiors, festooned with intricate and historically accurate decoration or decked out as period shops, parlors, libraries and salons. Yes, they can be gaudy kitsch. But what is undeniable is that the decorations are pleasing to the senses, adding to the overall feeling of overindulgence.

The most lasting impression is the space of Elle Shushan, a perennial exhibitor whose booth of portrait miniatures is a take-off on Empress Josephine’s boudoir at Malmaison, the chateau outside Paris she purchased in 1798. Nearby, the booth of Hans P. Kraus Jr. Fine Photographs is a re-creation of the 1905 interior of Alfred Stieglitz’s legendary 291 Gallery in New York, with works on view by many of the same photographers who exhibited there.

One of the benefits of an omnibus fair is that it gives viewers a chance to contemplate with relative ease how in different times and places the meaning of beauty was cast in a different light. Compare, for instance, the sensuous 2000-year-old Greek marble figure of Aphrodite at Rupert Wace with the marble female bust by Elie Nadelman from about 1909-10 at Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts. The Aphrodite is absolutely realistic in its depiction of the human form, while the bust is highly stylized.
790 2009-01-23 Others evoke images that may conflict with residents’ efforts to appear dignified when, for example, applying for jobs.

These include Crotch Crescent, Oxford; Titty Ho, Northamptonshire; Wetwang, East Yorkshire; Slutshole Lane, Norfolk; and Thong, Kent. And, in a country that delights in lavatory humor, particularly if the word “bottom” is involved, there is Pratts Bottom, in Kent, doubly cursed because “prat” is slang for buffoon.

As for Penistone, a thriving South Yorkshire town, just stop that sophomoric snickering.

“It’s pronounced ‘PENNIS-tun,’ ” Fiona Moran, manager of the Old Vicarage Hotel in Penistone, said over the telephone, rather sharply. When forced to spell her address for outsiders, she uses misdirection, separating the tricky section into two blameless parts: “p-e-n” — pause — “i-s-t-o-n-e.”

Several months ago, Lewes District Council in East Sussex tried to address the problem of inadvertent place-name titillation by saying that “street names which could give offense” would no longer be allowed on new roads.

“Avoid aesthetically unsuitable names,” like Gaswork Road, the council decreed. Also, avoid “names capable of deliberate misinterpretation,” like Hoare Road, Typple Avenue, Quare Street and Corfe Close.

The council explained that it was only following national guidelines and that it did not intend to change any existing lewd names.

Still, news of the revised policy raised an outcry.

“Sniggering at double entendres is a loved and time-honored tradition in this country,” Carol Midgley wrote in The Times of London. Ed Hurst, a co-author, with Rob Bailey, of “Rude Britain” and “Rude UK,” which list arguably offensive place names — some so arguably offensive that, unfortunately, they cannot be printed here — said that many such communities were established hundreds of years ago and that their names were not rude at the time.

“Place names and street names are full of history and culture, and it’s only because language has evolved over the centuries that they’ve wound up sounding rude,” Mr. Hurst said in an interview.

Mr. Bailey, who grew up on Tumbledown Dick Road in Oxfordshire, and Mr. Hurst got the idea for the books when they read about a couple who bought a house on Butt Hole Road, in South Yorkshire.

The name most likely has to do with the spot’s historic function as a source of water, a water butt being a container for collecting water. But it proved to be prohibitively hilarious.

“If they ordered a pizza, the pizza company wouldn’t deliver it, because they thought it was a made-up name,” Mr. Hurst said. “People would stand in front of the sign, pull down their trousers and take pictures of each other’s naked buttocks.”

The people in Crapstone have not had similar problems, although their sign is periodically stolen by word-loving merrymakers. And their village became a stock joke a few years ago, when a television ad featuring a prone-to-swearing soccer player named Vinnie Jones showed Mr. Jones’s car breaking down just under the Crapstone sign.

In the commercial, Mr. Jones tries to alert the towing company to his location while covering the sign and trying not to say “crap” in front of his young daughter.

The consensus in the village is that there is a perfectly innocent reason for the name “Crapstone,” though it is unclear what that is. Theories put forth by various residents the other day included “place of the rocks,” “a kind of twisting of the original word,” “something to do with the soil” and “something to do with Sir Francis Drake,” who lived nearby.

Jacqui Anderson, a doctor in Crapstone who used to live in a village called Horrabridge, which has its own issues, said that she no longer thought about the “crap” in “Crapstone.”

Still, when strangers ask where she’s from, she admitted, “I just say I live near Plymouth.”
791 2009-01-23 If there was anybody who understood what Matt wanted, it was Mike Bavis. Bavis relayed Gilroy’s request to Parker, the lifer coach who has amassed 36 seasons and 797 victories as of Thursday and pointedly warns hotshot freshmen that they have but a 5 percent chance of making the National Hockey League.

The new guy, whom Parker barely knew, wanted to wear 97? Never. But Bavis persisted. The greatest coaches are, in their own ways, adaptable, and in the end Parker said yes.

“In reality, I was discouraging him — and he came anyway,” Parker said, recalling how Gilroy agreed to switch from forward to defense and to spend his first year as a practice player. Gilroy looked so good in an exhibition, however, that he earned a spot on the team. He is now a two-time all-American defenseman, a senior captain and a preliminary candidate for the annual Hobey Baker Award, given to the best college player.

Because he took such a long route, with two years of junior hockey, Gilroy will turn 25 in September. Now 6 feet 2 inches and 205 pounds, Gilroy is very much a late bloomer.

“When he was 18, he wasn’t shaving,” his father, Frank Gilroy, said the other day. “He was 5-7, 145. You can’t fight genetics.”

At that age, Matt was 11 inches shorter than his father, a member of the St. John’s basketball Hall of Fame who has done well on Wall Street. The family had a nice house in North Bellmore, N.Y., and the children were encouraged to play whatever sport they liked.

Timmy and Matt, who was 13 months older, chose Nos. 97 and 98 on their youth hockey jerseys, in homage to the Great One.

In August 1993, Timmy fell off his bicycle, rushing to play in a neighborhood game. He died of brain injuries a few days later. His mother, PeggyAnn, remembers Matt lying in bed that night, crying and vowing to honor his brother.

“Timmy would have done great things,” Matt said the other day. “You can’t predict what.” Timmy needed to be remembered, Matt told his mother, vowing to wear No. 97 whenever he could. When that number was not possible, Matt wore 9 or 7, and his mother would sew a No. 97 patch inside Matt’s jersey, to get Timmy completely into the game.

The father did not push his children into his sport. The oldest boy, Frank Jr., played basketball for St. Mary’s High School and St. Anselm College. (“That’s why he’s Dad’s favorite,” Matt said the other day, his smirk coming through over the phone.)

Rink culture was as fanatic as schoolyard culture, Frank discovered. He learned his sport in the schoolyard of P.S. 32 in Flushing, Queens, where the older players taught the younger ones how to box out, how to give and go. A generation later, in a suburban county to the east, he saw some of his children gravitate to the sport made popular by the four-time Stanley Cup champion Islanders.

Sometimes PeggyAnn performed the hockey mom details, including driving to distant rinks, across bridges, so children could get 12 minutes of playing time. The first time she had to dress Matt and Timmy, she placed the shin guards and protective cup outside their uniforms. How was she to know? Now, it’s a family legend.

One day at the rink, Frank Gilroy spotted another willowy hockey dad — Billy Schaeffer, a great shooter at St. John’s from 1969 to 1973 and a three-year professional, escorting his son, Kevin (who would later be a teammate of Matt’s for two years at B.U.).

The two fathers even played for a while in an over-35 hockey game. “It was quite a sight, these two giants,” PeggyAnn reported. “They were pretty good.”

Recently, Frank took a break from his Wall Street job — he was in the last subway train stalled beneath the World Trade Center on 9/11 — and the family moved to Sudbury, Mass., so they could watch Matt and his younger brother Kevin, 21, together at B.U. this season.

Coach Parker tried to convince Matt to take one of the 23 offers from the N.H.L. after last season.

“I knew he would earn his degree, but his mother said, ‘You don’t understand, those are his classmates,’ ” Parker said. “They should have 40 children, that’s the kind of family it is.” (The Gilroys have eight surviving children, ages 9 through 26, not counting Timmy and another son who died shortly after birth.)

“There will be a reward for him,” Parker said of his walk-on with the unusual number. If the N.H.L. works out, Matt Gilroy will surely request Timmy’s No. 97, just as he promised, lying on his bed, the night his brother died.
792 2009-01-23 THE nominations for the 81st annual Academy Awards have lined up Big Hollywood against Little Hollywood, with a sprawling studio movie squaring off against an unusual independent film.

“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” the $150 million Paramount Pictures film starring Brad Pitt as a man aging backward, picked up 13 nominations, including ones for best picture and best director. Close behind with 10 nods, also including ones for best picture and director, was “Slumdog Millionaire,” a Fox Searchlight entry that was filmed on a relative shoestring budget ($15 million), had an unknown lead and was presented partly in Hindi.

Unlike last year’s competition, when a lineup of films bleak in tone and worldview dominated, this year’s batch collectively strike a more uplifting chord, or at least a more introspective one. Other best-picture nominees included “Frost/Nixon” from Universal Pictures and “Milk,” a Focus Features release that zeroes in on the struggle for gay rights.

“After all of the doom and gloom, and at this moment in our culture, people were perhaps looking for films that were a little different and a little more meaningful,” said Michael London, an executive producer of “Milk.” It received eight nominations, including a best-actor nod for Sean Penn. The showing was a comeback for the film, which the fluffier Golden Globes had mostly ignored.

But by far the biggest coup on Thursday was pulled off by the Weinstein Company with “The Reader,” a Holocaust-theme film focusing on a German woman with a dark secret, which grabbed the other best-picture slot. “The Reader” showed surprising strength, muscling past behemoths like “The Dark Knight” in the top category and securing nominations for best actress (Kate Winslet), best direction (Stephen Daldry), best adapted screenplay (David Hare) and best cinematography (Chris Menges and Roger Deakins).

Harvey Weinstein had pushed for the film to be eligible this year over objections of his erstwhile producing partner Scott Rudin, which motivated Mr. Rudin to remove his name from the movie. While Mr. Weinstein is no stranger to the best-picture category, he said, “I cried for the first time when I heard this one,” noting that two of the film’s producers, Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, died before it was released. “They were up there looking over this movie somehow,” Mr. Weinstein said.

The picture Mr. Rudin had been trumpeting, “Revolutionary Road,” fared poorly, receiving only one nod in the major categories, a best-supporting-actor nomination for Michael Shannon’s portrayal of a clear-eyed mental patient.

As always, the Oscars have the power to catapult a niche film into the mainstream and rewrite Hollywood’s pecking order. Rocketing to the top from that list were Richard Jenkins, nominated for his starring role in “The Visitor,” and Melissa Leo, who was nominated for best actress as a woman living in rural despair in the little-seen “Frozen River.” Each is a first-time nominee.

Ms. Leo got the news while at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, where she is doubling up in a hotel room to cut expenses. She said the Oscar buzz could help her land even better roles. “The door already got cracked open” because of the accolades for “Frozen River,” she said, but thanks to the Oscar nomination, “it might just open wide, and I will go carefully and try to choose wisely and, oh, just be so happy.”

Mr. Jenkins, who at first thought his son-in-law’s father was playing a joke on him when he called to offer congratulations, said he had no idea what effect the nomination will have on his career.

“I’m 61; Brad’s not going to have to move over,” he said with a laugh, referring to one of his fellow best-actor nominees, Mr. Pitt.

Hollywood will be just as interested in upsets, of course, and there were a few. Clint Eastwood was not nominated for best actor (and his “Gran Torino” was shut out). Christopher Nolan failed to gain attention for his direction of “The Dark Knight,” and Bruce Springsteen’s composition “The Wrestler” was not nominated for best song.

That Ms. Winslet was nominated as best actress was not a surprise, but there were gasps in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater here when the recognition came for her role in “The Reader” and not for her turn as an unhappy housewife in “Revolutionary Road.”

The blockbusters “The Dark Knight” and “Wall-E,” both considered to have good shots for best-picture nominations, had to make do with nods in secondary categories, though “Wall-E” was nominated for best animated film and for its original screenplay, a stunning feat for a picture with very little dialogue. Heath Ledger was nominated for best supporting actor for his role in “The Dark Knight.”

Among the surprises, Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for his comedic turn in “Tropic Thunder” as a self-absorbed Australian method actor who undergoes pigment alteration to play a black soldier. And in a first for the foreign-language category, attention went to an animated film, “Waltz With Bashir.”

Still, most of the nominations were expected. Mickey Rourke, whose portrayal of an over-the-hill athlete in “The Wrestler” has already won him a wheelbarrow full of accolades, including a Golden Globe, received a best-actor nomination.

He will square off against Mr. Penn, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Pitt and Frank Langella, noted for his depiction of Richard Nixon in “Frost/Nixon.”

Ms. Winslet has made much of her failure to win an Oscar despite years of critically acclaimed work and multiple nominations. She’s even joked about it, on an episode of the television series “Extras” a few years back. During that episode she played a nun who battles Nazis, joking to Ricky Gervais’s bumbling character that she took the part because a Holocaust movie is a guaranteed Oscar winner.

Joining Ms. Winslet and Ms. Leo in the best-actress category are Meryl Streep, who earned her 15th nomination (she has won twice) for her portrayal of a harsh nun in “Doubt”; Anne Hathaway, nominated for her role as a recovering drug addict in “Rachel Getting Married”; and Angelina Jolie, singled out for playing a mother searching for her son in “Changeling.”

Gus Van Sant, nominated for his direction of “Milk,” struck the cool I-didn’t-realize-nominations-were-this-morning pose. “I wasn’t that attuned to the thing,” he said in a telephone interview. “My reactions don’t bend to the game-show style of screaming and jumping up and down.”

Another nominee for “Milk,” Dustin Lance Black for original screenplay, was not quite so put together. “The tears started when I saw that Gus was nominated, and the meltdown built from there,” he said. “I’m just so grateful and hopeful this will get the movie’s message out to a wider audience.” Mr. Black said he was at home alone, pacing and waiting for the local news to report the nominations.

The terrain ahead for the Oscars themselves is more uncertain than many of the nominations had been. The Screen Actors Guild, at loggerheads with studios over a new employment contract, may try to use the high-profile platform to push its cause, possibly disrupting the telecast with pickets. (That is, unless a more moderate faction of the union stages a coup d’état first.)

What the ceremony itself will look like is also unclear, with producers promising to inject more frivolity into the proceedings to combat sinking television ratings but, so far, keeping details to themselves. Hugh Jackman, known primarily to movie fans as Wolverine in the “X-Men” franchise, will host the ceremony, set for broadcast by ABC on Feb. 22.

Ratings for last year’s Oscars plunged to a record low, with about 32 million viewers watching. Producers believe the telecast’s ratings turn in large part on the popularity of the movies the Academy chooses to honor. When the little-seen “Crash” won best picture in 2006, about 38.9 million people watched, one of the smallest turnouts for the so-called Super Bowl for Women since Nielsen Media Research started delivering overnight ratings. In contrast, when the immensely popular “Titanic” swept the awards in 1998, more than 55 million people tuned in.
793 2009-01-23 , also a large supplier of PC chips, reported a 33 percent decline in fourth-quarter revenue Thursday to $1.16 billion, while posting a $1.42 billion loss. Earlier this month, A.M.D. said it would reduce its work force by close to 9 percent.

Weakening sales for technology companies are hardly unusual in an economic downturn. Even , which reported a big increase in fourth-quarter revenue and operating profit on Thursday, has seen its growth slow. Microsoft executives suggested Thursday that this downturn is different from previous slumps, like the collapse in tech spending that followed the 2001 dot-com bust.

Rather than a recession, companies are witnessing a fall in consumer and business spending that could last for years and set a new low base for sales, Mr. Ballmer said. “The economy is resetting to a lower level of business and consumer spending,” he said.

Mr. Ballmer also said Microsoft would take a wait-and-see approach about acquisitions because company executives thought the price of potential targets would fall further. That gloomy assessment offers little hope to investors trying to figure out when tech , which have plunged with the overall market, will hit bottom.

Both Microsoft and Intel, which are generally conservative in their public outlooks, declined to provide forecasts for future sales, saying they were uncomfortable with the proposition in an erratic economy.

“That’s especially unusual for Microsoft,” said Brendan Barnicle, a software analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. “Historically, they have had some of the most accurate gauges of PCs, and they didn’t even try to offer guidance.”

Analysts expect PC sales to fall about 8 percent in 2009, marking just the second time in the last two decades, including 2001, that PC sales will have declined for the year. Analysts at the research company Forrester say that surveys show people are putting off PC purchases and spending less on systems they do buy.

Other PC component makers like , and have also grappled with evaporating sales and significant layoffs.

The reports from all of the component and software makers have set an ominous mood for and , the largest PC manufacturers, which report their financial results next month.

Some of Microsoft’s immediate issues stem from changing trends in the PC market as well as missteps as it has tried to move into newer markets like Web search and Internet-based software delivery, or cloud computing.

Microsoft’s revenue for the second quarter rose 2 percent, to $16.63 billion, and its earnings of 47 cents in the quarter missed the consensus forecast from by 2 cents. While sales of business software and Xbox gaming consoles aided the results, revenue from Windows dropped 8 percent, to $3.98 billion from $4.33 billion last year.

One factor that hurt sales of Windows was the rise of netbooks — a type of cheap, compact laptop that is growing in popularity, especially in . The devices use less powerful chips than typical PCs, and as a result, Microsoft must offer the less bulky Windows XP instead of Vista on the netbooks and sell it at a discount in order to remain competitive with the open-source Linux operating system.

Looking long term, Microsoft’s traditional PC software business could face even more pressure because 30 to 40 percent of the revenue comes from corporate subscriptions that stretch over a number of years. Layoffs and reduced capital spending mean that Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., may see fewer subscriptions when renewal periods come up for customers.

With so much dependence on the Windows and Office franchises, Microsoft has been trying to diversify its business. Most notably, the company made a failed bid for to try to bolster its online search business and compete better against Google.

Microsoft said Thursday that it would replace some of the fired workers with new hires, many of them to handle search, as it tries to grow new businesses.

“They have never dealt with a situation where PCs didn’t just keep going up, and there’s this sense that now is the time to start and write its next chapter,” Mr. Barnicle said. Microsoft’s online business continued to lose money in the quarter, placing added pressure on the company to do something more drastic.

Richard Williams, an analyst at Cross Research, complained that Microsoft’s layoffs and other cost cuts appeared cosmetic because it employs 94,000 people.

“Microsoft really needs to materially boost its effort in the Web,” he said. “The match with Yahoo makes even more sense now.”
794 2009-01-23 A day after stock markets posted their biggest one-day advance in weeks, they made an about-face on Thursday. The major indexes gave back close to half their gains, finishing sharply lower as investors grappled with a blast of disappointing news from Microsoft and the housing market.

All sectors finished lower, with bank stocks and consumer-oriented companies hobbled by worries about domestic spending and the health of the financial sector.

“As stones are unturned, we find deeper and bigger holes in the financial sector,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.

In its third consecutive day of triple-digit moves, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.30 points, or 1.3 percent, to end at 8,122.80. The wider Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 12.74 points, or 1.5 percent, to finish at 827.50, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.8 percent to 1,465.49.

While investors are eager for Congress to pass an $800 billion economic stimulus package, there is a growing uneasiness that even a huge spending plan might be dwarfed by the persistent economic slump.

802 2009-01-24 The Swiss authorities on Friday released from jail the last of three family members suspected of smuggling atomic technology to Libya and Iran as part of the nuclear black market of Abdul Qadeer Khan, officials disclosed.

They said the suspect, Marco Tinner, was freed in Bern after posting bail. His release, ending more than three years of investigative detention, was delayed nearly a month because of worries that he still had access to nuclear-weapons secrets.

His brother Urs was released Dec. 22, and their father, Friedrich, was released in 2006. All three men are suspected of criminal export violations, and they still face possible charges as the Swiss inquiry advances.

“The release of the Tinners has no influence on the pretrial investigation,” Andreas Müller, the examining magistrate in the case who is assessing if a trial is warranted, said in an interview.

The inquiry has been stymied by the Swiss government’s decision last year to destroy a trove of computer files that documented the family’s business dealings. While officials said the action was meant to keep atomic plans out of terrorist hands, American officials said they had urged the destruction partly to hide evidence of a secret relationship between the Tinners and the C.I.A.

This week a Swiss parliamentary panel said the files’ continued existence would have posed no danger to Switzerland.
803 2009-01-24 “Inauguration Sets Online Video Record” (news article, Jan. 21) underscores an often-overlooked fact in today’s world of emerging media platforms: When it matters most, broadcast television remains the single most dependable visual medium in America. While Internet users experienced glitches and spotty online coverage of the inauguration, TV broadcast coverage was live, clear and reliable.

In a society of media “haves” and “have-nots,” our nation’s ubiquitous TV broadcasting system seamlessly united all Americans, creating a true national experience during one of the most extraordinary days in American political history.

Viewers with nothing more than a 13-inch TV set and a rooftop antenna could watch our nation’s new leader take the oath of office. With rabbit ears and an HDTV, many Americans watched in crystal-clear clarity — at no cost — as the president and first lady strolled down Pennsylvania Avenue.

Many policy makers have expressed strong interest in expanding broadband applications to all corners of America — which is most certainly a laudable goal. But with broadcasters committed to a successful transition to digital television, let us never forget the reliability of “free TV” delivered by local stations and our network partners.
804 2009-01-24 There sure do seem to be a lot of bankruptcy lawyers around these days.

Law firms, scrambling to keep up with changing client needs in a weakening economy, are rushing to pump up their bankruptcy departments by shifting around staff and having lawyers study up on restructuring, as more people abandon the big deals of boom times to take on desperate negotiations of companies on the brink.

At some firms, seasoned bankruptcy partners hold seminars and host brown bag lunches to introduce Chapter 11 proceedings to associates more accustomed to carefully planned mergers than to corporate fire sales. Some firms have poached bankruptcy experts from rivals in a bid to bolster business and to bring in a source of knowledge for lawyers new to dark times.

“What firms are trying to do here is provide some ability to people to move,” said Bradford W. Hildebrandt, president of Hildebrandt International, a consulting firm that often advises law firms. “Frankly they’re trying to avoid layoffs.”

The shifts happen less frequently at the level of partners. Partners command higher prices and clients may be unwilling to pay those prices when the partner is just learning the details of bankruptcy law. And the most experienced and sought-after advisers are the ones with a range of experience across different areas of law, several lawyers said.

“The people who are most successful are the counselors, who know a little bit about everything,” Said Kenneth A. Lefkowitz, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed in New York.

But for the more junior lawyers being shifted around, working on bankruptcy matters should help them become advisers to corporate chiefs, said Douglas P. Bartner, head of the bankruptcy group at Shearman & Sterling in New York.
805 2009-01-24 Dow Chemical is in talks to close its proposed $15.4 billion buyout of Rohm & Haas, the specialty chemicals maker, after federal regulators approved the deal, the companies said. Approval by the Federal Trade Commission was the last regulatory hurdle after the European Commission signed off this month.

The F.T.C. said Dow must sell facilities in six states to ease antitrust concerns. Rohm & Haas, based in Philadelphia, said according to the agreement, that the acquisition must close within two business days of final regulatory approval, or by Tuesday. When the deal was first struck in July, Dow, based in Midland, Mich., said the acquisition of Rohm & Haas and its specialty chemicals portfolio would give it a buffer against volatile commodities prices in the chemical market.
806 2009-01-24 “Close the door,” Ms. Franklin said at last.

I did as commanded and stepped back, blushing in embarrassment. The Rolls-Royce sped away with a police car in the lead and a white stretch limousine and a second police car bringing up the rear. It was a poignant reminder that I would have to strive to earn a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T, never mind a nice tip, during my stint as a rookie doorman.

I felt like a mere bait fish in a glittering pond full of rich and famous whales. Along with the legendary singer, the Four Seasons guest list included Oprah Winfrey; Steven Spielberg; the billionaire George Soros; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and his wife, Maria Shriver; the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns; the media maven Arianna Huffington; and the actors Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman.

Even so, I took pride in the opportunity to work for one of the most prestigious brands in the hospitality industry. Based in Toronto, the Four Seasons is a management company that runs (but does not own) 80 luxury hotels worldwide. The Four Seasons at 2800 Pennsylvania Avenue, in Georgetown, is the only hotel in the District of Columbia that boasts a Mobil five-star rating and a AAA five-diamond rating. It has more than 450 employees and 222 rooms, a staff-to-room ratio of better than two to one.

During a one-day training session the week before the inauguration, my Four Seasons colleagues had indoctrinated me in the hotel’s service culture standards. A chart posted in the hall near the human resources office literally spelled out the particulars using the seven letters in the word “service.” I managed to memorize less than half the list.

“Employees will actively greet guests, SMILE, and speak clearly in a friendly manner,” decreed item No. 1. “Employees will make EYE contact even in passing with an acknowledgment,” item No. 2 declared. “All staff will create a sense of RECOGNITION by using the guest’s name, when known, in a natural and discreet manner,” added item No. 3.

I was equally, if not more, daunted upon discovering that the Four Seasons had a so-called “glitch system.” As the hotel’s manager, David Bernand, informed me, when an employee makes a mistake like misplacing a piece of luggage, the error is entered into a computerized database. At a regularly scheduled meeting at 10 a.m. the following day, the hotel’s supervisors review the cause of the error and devise ways to compensate by offering the unintentionally mistreated guest extra attention and services.

“We try to make the guest forget that we forgot their bags.” Mr. Bernand said.

My role as a doorman demanded special grace and prowess. I would often be the first member of the hotel staff a guest saw upon arriving and the last one a guest saw upon departing. According to the head concierge, Javier Loureiro, who had started as a doorman when the hotel opened in 1979, I needed to have “radar” eyes. “We strive for seamless and intuitive service,” Mr. Loureiro said. “You have to be able to sense that someone is coming up behind you even when you are looking forward.”

My doorman trainer, Eskander, noted that Inauguration Day would pose unique challenges in teamwork. The hotel was booked to capacity with more than 400 guests staying for a required five-night minimum at rates ranging from $895 a night for a standard room to $15,000 a night for the presidential suite. In addition to opening doors, I would be expected to assist the bellmen and the valet parkers in tagging luggage, ticketing cars and directing limo traffic. “Whenever someone else is busy, you pitch in,” Eskander said.

On Inauguration Day, I arrived at the Four Seasons in the 5:55 a.m. darkness. I fetched my doorman’s cap, coat and trousers at the uniform pickup room in the hotel basement and dressed in the men’s locker room. I tried to practice a gracious smile in front of a wall mirror, but I kept flashing toothy grins and lippy leers that looked insincere and a little scary.

I joined Eskander under the portico at 6:30. Shortly before my star-crossed encounter with Aretha Franklin, I greeted Denzel Washington and his wife, Pauletta Pearson, with a smile and a “Good morning.” Ms. Pearson, who was bundled in fur, paused to return my smile. Mr. Washington, who had not donned a winter coat, headed straight for an S.U.V. waiting in the driveway.

While I never did see Mr. Soros, Ms. Winfrey and Mr. Spielberg — they evidently slipped out a side entrance on 29th Street — I spent the ensuing four hours opening the front door for hotel guests and visitors like Mr. Burns, Mr. Jackson, Ms. Portman, Ms. Huffington, the former baseball star Dave Winfield and the PBS talk show host Charlie Rose. Alerted that the rookie doorman on duty was actually a reporter, Ms. Huffington, a longtime Four Seasons habitué, offered a critique.

“You look handsome in your uniform,” she allowed. “But you are not like the Four Seasons doormen who have been here for years. Don’t quit your day job.”

Shortly before noon, I raced down to the flat-screen TV in the basement-level employees’ cafeteria along with more than 50 bellmen, housekeepers, desk clerks, cooks, valets, waiters, bartenders, supervisors and fellow doormen. When Barack Obama finished reciting his oath of office, I joined them in a spontaneous outburst of applause and cheers.

By 1 p.m., I was back at my doorman’s post. Because the city’s core was cordoned off, even guests with limos had been forced to walk long distances to and from Capitol Hill. But almost everyone returning from the inauguration ceremony was in an ebullient mood. I got my first and only tip — a crisp dollar bill — from a man who snared one of the few available taxicabs. I got an even greater thrill when I greeted Governor Schwarzenegger by name and he responded.

“Hey, good to see you,” he said.

When my shift ended at 3 p.m., many of the guests were already getting dressed for the inaugural balls. Exhausted but inspired, I wanted to turn into a pumpkin or at least back into a reporter. I changed out of my doorman’s uniform, and departed the Four Seasons with a line from Mr. Obama’s Inaugural Address still ringing in my ears: “Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.”
807 2009-01-24 Citigroup and Bank of America are hardly the only two financial firms to confront the issue. During the last three months of 2008, at least seven other firms receiving bailout funds — American Express, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, KeyCorp, Morgan Stanley, PNC and Bank of New York Mellon — all lobbied the government about the bailout, according to a review of their most recent disclosure reports.

The automakers that received billions under the same program lobbied as well: including General Motors; its financing arm, GMAC; and Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that controls Chrysler. Other recipients of federal financing also lobbied Congress, the Treasury or both about other matters.

The American International Group, taken over by the government during an injection of more than $40 billion last fall to prevent the company’s collapse, has discontinued all its federal lobbying; it is now in effect government-owned. But its former executives continue to lobby.

Its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, ousted a few years ago amid allegations of securities fraud, is leading a group of shareholders lobbying for a chance to renegotiate the terms of the government takeover or buy back a bigger stake in the company.

According to a recent filing, A.I.G. shareholders paid $90,000 in the fourth quarter to a lobbying team at Ogilvy Government Relations that includes the Republican lobbying powerhouse Wayne L. Berman, a former assistant secretary of commerce under the first President George Bush and a major fund-raiser for the second.

The group also includes three Democrats who had been top aides to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; Senator Edward M. Kennedy; and the former House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. (Mickey Kantor, secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton, has advised the group as a lawyer as well.)

Lawmakers, troubled by the prospect of taxpayer-subsidized influence-peddling, are threatening to crack down. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican, are pushing legislation that would explicitly bar companies from using bailout funds for lobbying or campaign contributions.

Although hard to enforce, the measure puts banks on notice that aggressive lobbying could set off a Congressional backlash.

“That taxpayer dollars intended to stabilize the economy could find their way into the bank accounts of lobbying firms” is “completely unacceptable,” Ms. Feinstein said in a speech supporting the measure.

On Friday, President Obama issued his own call for more oversight and transparency, citing “companies that have received taxpayer assistance then going out and renovating bathrooms or offices, or in other ways not managing those dollars appropriately.” This was an apparent allusion to reports of office renovations by the former chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a recent acquisition by Bank of America whose heavy losses led to an expanded bailout for the bank.

Bankers, though, defend their right to a voice in public policy debates about the industry’s future. “Nobody mentioned that you are giving up your Constitutional right to petition the government” when accepting federal money, said Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association.

He acknowledged, however, that Citigroup and Bank of America were in a more ambiguous position than the rest of the roughly 200 banks that accepted money from the Treasury and agreed to pay it interest as part of the bailout program. While most banks are required to demonstrate financial health to qualify for the deal, the two giants received $90 billion in emergency measures to prop them up and agreed to give the government a larger say in management.

The two banking behemoths had entered a “middle ground,” Mr. Yingling said, between the other private banks accepting federal investments and the three financial firms under full federal control: A.I.G. and the failed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “I would expect that institutions in that middle ground would be well aware that they need to be careful about the tone and manner in which they lobby,” he said.

Citigroup and Bank of America say internal policies prohibit the use of any bailout money for lobbying. Neither, however, has stopped pressing its interests in Washington, albeit more quietly.

Though Bank of America says it has stopped lobbying about the bailout legislation — the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP — it continues to lobby on other matters. The bank spent about $1 million on federal lobbying in last year’s fourth quarter, including $820,000 for its own lobbyists, according to filings.

Ms. Norton, the spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether Bank of America was lobbying on other financial crisis proposals, such as creation of a government-controlled “bad bank” to take over toxic securities.

Nicholas Calio, Citigroup’s top lobbyist, handled Congressional relations for both the first and second President George Bush. Its team of outside lobbyists has also included a former Congressional liaison for President Clinton, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary and the veteran Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf.

The two banks’ dilemma is an increasing problem for the industry, said Scott Talbott, top lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. “There is a TARP blowback problem,” he said.
808 2009-01-24 People involved in the deal cautioned that the talks could still collapse, in part because there are so many moving parts: the buyer, the seller and at least five banks that all need to agree on financing conditions in a very difficult credit market. The boards of both companies have scheduled special meetings for Sunday to vote on the deal in anticipation of continued negotiations through the weekend.

Other companies that have long been seen as take-over candidates include the conventional drug giants Bristol-Myers and Schering-Plough and the biotechnology players Amgen and Biogen Idec.

The negotiations between Pfizer and Wyeth appear to be driven by cost savings as much as by sales and research opportunities. Pfizer is heading toward a big patent cliff with the expiration of its rights to Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world, in November 2011. Sales of the drug, $12.7 billion in 2007, account for a quarter of the company’s total revenue. And by 2015, patent expirations will mean Pfizer will have lost 70 percent of the revenue it would have had in 2007.

As patents expire, generic drug makers can swoop in with low-priced versions. Indeed, the growing market share of generic drugs is one of the big problems for many makers of brand-name pharmaceuticals.

Wyeth has a big vaccine and biologics business that is not facing the same level of patent pressures, because it is much more complicated and cost-prohibitive to make generic versions of such drugs. So a merger would add diversity and bring stability to Pfizer’s drug sales.

Still, because much of Pfizer and Wyeth’s portfolios overlap, there is potential to save billions of dollars through cutting duplicative costs, analysts say.

“If Pfizer and Wyeth combine sales forces and other operations, they will have a sleeker cost structure,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “Most other large companies have cut just everything they can. The only way to come up with new cuts without endangering their future is to merge in a way that creates redundancies that give the companies new job-cutting opportunities.”

Two weeks ago Pfizer said it would lay off 800 researchers, and it hinted at further job cuts. Last year, it did away with more than 10,000 jobs and announced it would focus on six therapeutic areas — cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.

It remains an open question whether mergers in the pharmaceutical industry work at all. Pfizer is itself a product of a series of mergers, with mixed results. It bought Warner-Lambert, which owned Lipitor, for more than $90 billion in stock in 2000 and three years later bought Pharmacia for stock valued at $60 billion.

"Pfizer’s tried it before, and it really hasn’t worked with other firms," said Edward F. X. Hughes, a professor who teaches pharmaceutical business at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

The deal may also demonstrate that pharmaceutical companies feel the need to be more diversified beyond prescription drugs. A Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up would be one way for Pfizer to get back into the consumer health business. Wyeth owns brands like Advil and Centrum vitamins. In 2006, Pfizer sold its consumer business — which included such household names as Sudafed, Listerine, Nicorette and Lubriderm — to Johnson & Johnson, which because of that acquisition has managed to weather the financial storm better than its rivals.

For Pfizer, which is led by Jeffrey B. Kindler, 52, a lawyer who previously worked for McDonald’s, the transaction would also bolster the company’s presence in biologic drugs, which are made from living cells, instead of the chemicals on which conventional pharmaceuticals are based. Wyeth’s Prevnar, a childhood vaccine against pneumonia and meningitis, is made from living cells and is generally considered more immune to competition from generics. Wyeth also makes Enbrel, one of the world’s biggest biologics with about $3 billion in global sales for the first nine months of 2008. Enbrel is a drug that treats adult rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis.

“To be able to take over Wyeth’s well-regarded biotech stuff is pretty good,” Mr. Gordon said.

Investors applauded the possibility of a deal. Shares of Wyeth closed up 12.6 percent to $43.74 after The Wall Street Journal reported news of the talks on Friday. Pfizer rose 1.4 percent to close at $17.45, a rare show of confidence by investors for a potential buyer during a merger.
809 2009-01-24 “When we surveyed people about how long they seriously struggled, over 40 percent said more than two years,” said Katherine M. Porter, associate professor at the University of Iowa law school and a researcher with the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, a continuing study of consumer bankruptcy filings. “A lot of attorneys say they wish people would come earlier, before they emptied their retirement accounts or lost their car to repossession,” she said.

Because bankruptcy is so complex, and because bankruptcy laws underwent a major overhaul in 2005, many people are not only wary of filing, but also confused about their options and what the possible outcomes are.

One common misunderstanding is that declaring bankruptcy will ruin your credit. If you’re at the point of even considering bankruptcy, it’s likely that your credit is in tatters anyway, notes Ms. Porter.

“You may not end up that much worse off,” she said. In some cases, your credit could emerge in better shape once you’ve dealt with your debts.

Another myth is that you must be at the frayed end of your financial rope before you file. You won’t lose everything in a bankruptcy because some assets are protected, and you will need those to move forward, says Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School and one of the lead researchers on the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. Waiting until your resources are entirely depleted defeats an important purpose of bankruptcy, “which is to help people rebuild their lives on a sounder footing,” Ms. Warren said.

IT was the desire to move forward with her life, not just shrug off her debts, that finally pushed Claire Morgan, who lives in Chicago, to begin the bankruptcy process in December. In addition to lingering student loans of about $12,000, Ms. Morgan had been struggling to pay $40,000 in credit card debt — a sum slightly higher than her annual income, she said. But she couldn’t make any headway.

In part, it was the sense of futility that finally pushed Ms. Morgan over the edge. But she also happened to hear a cautionary tale about a friend, also deeply in debt, who had decided not to declare bankruptcy — and ended up living in constant strain, unable to move forward with life.

“That really made me think twice,” she said. “Bankruptcy was the last thing I wanted. But it’s better to be able to say ‘I’m in the clear’ than to be still be struggling in five years to pay $40,000 in debt on a $35,000 salary.”

Knowing whether to file, when to file and whether to do so under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code is a decision best made with the help of a lawyer. Most bankruptcy lawyers offer a free initial consultation, Ms. Porter said. The National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys has a Web site where you can search for a lawyer by location.
810 2009-01-24 In news sure to cheer the theater district, Martin McDonagh, a newly minted Academy Award nominee (for his original screenplay for the movie “In Bruges,” which he also directed), has written a new play, “A Behanding in Spokane.” Unlike Mr. McDonagh’s previous plays, including “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” and “The Cripple of Inishmaan” (now at the Linda Gross Theater in Manhattan), it is not set in Ireland: it takes place in “small-town America,” according to its script. “It’s brand-new,” Mr. McDonagh, above, said in an interview. “It’s still under wraps, but it should be for the next season.” He declined to say where it would be performed.
811 2009-01-24 Even with the departure of William Petersen and his character, Gil Grissom, CBS’s “CSI” remained Thursday’s most-watched show, according to Nielsen’s estimates. The crime drama, now in its ninth season, earned 17.5 million viewers at 9 p.m., improving considerably on the 8.6 million who tuned in at 8 for a “CSI” repeat. At 10, CBS’s “Eleventh Hour” garnered 12.3 million total viewers, ahead of ABC’s “Private Practice” (9.6 million) and NBC’s “ER” (7.7 million). ABC won the night in the 18-to-49 age group, despite trailing CBS in total viewers, largely because of “Grey’s Anatomy,” which earned the night’s highest ratings in that demographic and 14.3 million total viewers. Fox and NBC ranked third and fourth for the night, respectively.
812 2009-01-24 PARIS — President Nicolas Sarkozy of France announced new financial aid for the country’s newspapers on Friday, but stopped short of the overhaul that analysts say is needed to revitalize the sector.

Mr. Sarkozy promised a variety of aid, including tax breaks for delivery services. In an effort to help newspapers through the recession, Mr. Sarkozy said the government would double the amount of advertising it did in print and online newspapers.

“It is the state’s primary responsibility to respond to an emergency,” he said, “and there is an emergency caused by the impact of the collapse of advertising revenue.”

The French government’s support, which totals about 280 million euros, or $362 million, a year, would be increased by about 200 million euros a year for three years under Mr. Sarkozy’s plan.

The proposal included one unusual measure aimed at attracting young people to newspapers: giving 18-year-olds free subscriptions to the printed publication of their choice. The program would to be financed jointly by the government and publishers.
813 2009-01-24 The John Williams piece composed for President Obama’s inauguration this week finally was to receive its world premiere on Friday. In Pittsburgh.

The cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, the clarinetist Anthony McGill and the pianist Gabriela Montero took the stage during Tuesday’s inauguration and appeared to play the work, “Airs and Simple Gifts.”

Their playing was heard, but it had been recorded by the quartet on Sunday and was broadcast at the ceremony. The effect of the extreme cold on their instruments made a decent rendition impossible, so, the musicians said, they played along with the recording.

On Friday it emerged that a bit less of a performance was actually happening on the stage. Mr. Ma, in an interview with National Public Radio, said he and Mr. Perlman put soap on their bows, reducing friction and making the notes barely audible. The piano’s action was altered so it remained silent, he said.

In a separate interview, he said Mr. McGill’s clarinet could be heard, while he fingered, bowed and vibrated as normal. “If we had played on the instruments that we had we would have had a really terrible performance,” Mr. Ma said. The other musicians did not return telephone messages.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra said it would present the work during Friday night’s regular program, which was to include Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” with Ms. Montero as soloist. She was to be joined in the Williams piece by members of the orchestra.

David Sogg, a principal bassoonist of the orchestra, joked that the players should announce from the stage that no recording was involved.
814 2009-01-24 The great lurch toward grudging respectability that began a few years ago will almost certainly continue in 2009, if only because of the continuing popularity of mass fare like Wii bowling, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, not to mention Madden. And so video games are becoming acceptable in the manner that watching reality shows or sports on TV all night is acceptable. Bravo. But that can’t be all games are capable of. The real test of 2009 is whether games with a bit more intellectual and artistic ambition can continue to flourish.

I have to admit that by Christmas I was a little burned out on video games. Playing games for hundreds of hours a month can do that to you.

So I got away, in the hope that taking a refresher course in other media would help me understand games more thoroughly. I read Hermann Hesse. I saw Alan Gilbert conduct a program of Schubert, Brahms and Schumann at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. I watched Clint Eastwood’s first major film, “A Fistful of Dollars,” back to back with his latest, “Gran Torino.”

It worked, because at times in all the reading and watching and listening — in all the merely consuming — I chafed at how little control I had, at my inability to affect the narrative, at being taken on a joy ride by someone else. At those moments I longed to be able to make a decision, to solve the problem myself, to take responsibility for what would happen next — all the elements that make a game.

But more important, it also worked because all of that reading and watching and listening proved to me just how far most games have to go before they rival traditional media in two important areas: emotional depth and eliciting an intellectual engagement with one’s own place in the world.

From a narrative perspective, there have certainly been a few games that provided those qualities; historically, Planescape: Torment and BioShock come to mind. More recently, so have games like Fable II, Fallout 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV. And setting aside narrative, I find many of those qualities in the unscripted vastness of Eve Online.

But the artistically deflating, if commercially inspiring, truth is that with the exception of a few mega-franchises, the biggest bucks in the game business now come from providing casual party and family games that are little more than interactive cartoons.

The four top-selling games of last year all fall into that category, more or less. Yes, Wii Fit is helping people in a real-world way, and of course almost every Nintendo game is a jewel of polish and design. But Nintendo games aren’t generally trying to elucidate anything meaningful about the human condition. And neither are lucrative popcorn shooters like Gears of War and Call of Duty.

It is hardly a bad thing that it seems to be working. Even as the economy faltered and traditional entertainment segments from Broadway to the music business continued to reel, the overall game industry grew by 19 percent last year in the United States, to $21.3 billion, including $11 billion in software sales. Nintendo claimed responsibility for 99 percent of that growth, mainly because of Wii and the portable DS unit. So the morning-radio shock jocks are playing football and basketball games, and most everyone else is playing Wii bowling. There are a fair number of people getting shot with virtual machine guns. Here and there something approaching art is happening and actually making money.

Let’s focus on that last category in 2009, whether they arrive as new games in established franchises like Resident Evil, Mass Effect, God of War, BioShock or StarCraft, or as new properties revealing new worlds.
815 2009-01-24 Mr. Alexis faces several charges, the most serious of which is attempted murder. If convicted of that charge, he could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison.

Mr. Alexis, a 23-year-old Haitian immigrant, is using an insanity defense.

His lawyer, Steven R. Fusfeld, told the jury that his client suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.

“Kenny Alexis lacked the capacity to know and appreciate the nature and the consequences of his conduct, to know and appreciate that what he was doing was wrong,” Mr. Fusfeld said. “He was hearing voices telling him to strike out others before they got to him.”

Mr. Ryan asked the jurors not to buy Mr. Alexis’s defense.

“Even people who are deeply, deeply mentally ill know the difference between right and wrong,” he said. “Mr. Alexis is an antisocial, ill-tempered man who’s angry at the world.”

Mr. Alexis was not in court for the opening statements because when the jury was initially brought into the courtroom, he stood up and shouted, and Justice Charles H. Solomon had him removed. Mr. Alexis later returned after agreeing to remain quiet, but he was ejected again after another outburst.

Mr. Alexis’s stabbing spree, Mr. Ryan said, began at about 3 p.m. on June 13, on a downtown C train.

Christopher McCarthy, who was 21 at the time, and his girlfriend, Ganda Krisananuwatara, then 20, were visiting from Texas and, after visiting the Guggenheim Museum, went to the West Side and took a wrong turn, ending up at Columbia University. They were taking the C train back downtown to their intended destination in the West 70s, Mr. Ryan said, when Mr. Alexis sat across from them. As the train pulled into the 110th Street station, Mr. Ryan said, Mr. Alexis stood up and appeared to hit Mr. McCarthy in the chest before fleeing.

Mr. McCarthy responded, “He stabbed me,” and then blood began flowing from his chest as he crumpled to the floor.

Testifying on Friday, Mr. McCarthy said the pain was excruciating after a knife thrust into his chest. He said that before he fell, “I saw a figure running out the door.”

From the floor, he said, he saw the silhouettes of people standing around him. Mr. McCarthy kissed his girlfriend before his vision went from blurred to black, he said, but he remained conscious. He said he could feel everything that was happening, including the bumps of the stairs as he was being carried out of the station on a stretcher and a tube being thrust down his throat and into his chest.

About 12 hours later, at 3 a.m., two Mexican immigrants, Jorge Martinez and Ambrosio Castro, were sitting on a bench on the platform of the Rockefeller Center subway station after having worked a 12-hour shift at a restaurant. Mr. Alexis approached them and asked Mr. Castro if he could borrow his cellphone, Mr. Ryan said. He said no and Mr. Alexis stabbed him, Mr. Ryan said, and then fled.

About 30 minutes later, Mr. Ryan said, Mr. Alexis walked into a grocery store at 58th Street and Broadway, where the owner, Hong Wong Shin, was working behind the register. Mr. Alexis took a bottle of water from a cooler, drank some of it and put it back in the cooler, Mr. Ryan said, and Mr. Shin told him he needed to pay. Mr. Alexis pulled out his knife and took a swipe at Mr. Shin, who was able to dodge the blade, Mr. Ryan said.

Roughly a half-hour after that, Mr. Ryan said, Mr. Alexis approached two tourists from Montreal, Melanie Carrier and Audrey Perrier, who were looking for a place to eat after a night on the town. As Mr. Alexis approached them from behind, at 47th Street in Times Square, Mr. Ryan said, the women noticed him but ignored him as he tried to get their attention. He stabbed both of them in the back, the prosecutor said.

When Mr. Alexis ran away, the doorman at the nearby W Hotel in Times Square followed him and called 911 on his cellphone, Mr. Ryan said. Several cabbies also pursued him, and the police eventually arrived and arrested Mr. Alexis at the corner of 47th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Ryan said.
816 2009-01-24 Now, Mr. Lewis is struggling to fix Merrill while integrating his bank with yet another company, the Countrywide Financial Corporation, which his bank bought also last year.

“I don’t think he survives when this is all said and done,” said Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey. “He has made some pretty big mistakes over the last couple of months and as conditions inside that bank worsen, he’s going to come under more and more pressure.”

Still, the Bank of America board, whose ranks include the mayor of Spartanburg, S.C.; a retired general, Tommy R. Franks; and the former chairman and chief executive of Lowe’s, has offered up no signals that it has lost confidence in its leader.

Moreover, analysts ask, who would the board find to succeed Mr. Lewis?

But some shareholders are growing increasingly frustrated with the decision to push through the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.

For Mr. Lewis, Merrill Lynch represented not only a coveted prize but the gamble of his career. When he reached a deal with Mr. Thain this summer, he crowed that not only had he picked up the crown jewel for a bargain price, but that it would very quickly start to yield results.

“This was almost a perfect fit, and we thought it was close enough to the bottom that we could make the deal work and be very good for our shareholders,” Mr. Lewis said at the time. “I don’t think it will come out of the doldrums in the next week or so, but as soon as the market gets its legs again, you will see a higher value.”

Instead, losses mounted and Mr. Lewis is now fighting to prop up his banking empire and keep his job.

In mid-January, just hours after receiving a second round of government funding to cover heavy losses in its Merrill subsidiary, Mr. Lewis drew fire from investors more than a little curious to know why the bank didn’t alert them to the losses.

In the timeline provided by Mr. Lewis on the conference call with investors and Wall Street analysts in mid-January, he said he was surprised to learn of the magnitude of the losses himself in December and considered walking away from the deal.

He said he was persuaded not to, partly by regulators who feared more instability on Wall Street if the deal did not close.

The bank’s shareholders voted on the merger on Dec. 5. Mr. Lewis claims he found out about the losses later, but before the merger closed on Jan. 1.

Others, however, say Mr. Thain gave his board estimates for the quarter on Dec. 8 and that those estimates were not nearly as bad as the final results, according to a person briefed on the discussions.

While that certainly strengthens Mr. Lewis’s case that he did not know how bad Merrill’s quarter was before the shareholder vote, others say he still had time to warn them.

“I had already voted against the merger, but I think a lot of other shareholders would have joined me if they had known about the losses,” said Jerry E. Finger, whose company, Finger Interests Number One, is a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by Susman Godfrey, one of many shareholder lawsuits that have been filed against the executives and board members of both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on the suits.

“The merger was so dilutive to begin with and it became even more dilutive after they had to accept all of this funding from the U.S.,” said Mr. Finger, whose company and family hold about 1.5 million shares of Bank of America dating back to when he sold a bank he started in Texas in 1963 to NationsBank in 1996. Bank of America and NationsBank merged in 1998. “They had to have knowledge well before the close of the deal of the Merrill Lynch loss and they didn’t have to close,” Mr. Finger said.
817 2009-01-24 Senate consideration of President Obama’s choice for the Pentagon’s No. 2 job will be allowed to proceed after the Armed Services Committee chairman said that an ethics waiver would be granted to the nominee, William J. Lynn III, who was a registered lobbyist for a military contractor. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the committee, said the director of the Office of Management and Budget waived provisions of Mr. Obama’s new executive order on ethics for Mr. Lynn, nominated to be deputy defense secretary. Without a waiver, those provisions would appear to preclude Mr. Lynn’s acting on many significant issues. With the waiver, Mr. Levin said, the Senate can act on the nomination. He also emphasized that the committee would continue to insist that Mr. Lynn comply with ethics rules that would require him to recuse himself for one year from decisions involving his prior employer, Raytheon, unless specifically authorized to participate.
818 2009-01-24 The powerful and sometimes poetic jazz pianist Cyrus Chestnut has worked with a trio for about 15 years, since he first made his name. That’s a while. The piano trio format remains as effective and economical today as it was half a century ago — in fact it’s the kind of group that usually delivers the news about where mainstream jazz’s aesthetics are — but everyone needs a change of clothes once in a while.

At Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola this week, Mr. Chestnut has a brand-new group: a quintet. Not surprisingly, it’s his working trio, along with trumpet and saxophone. But it creates a different way for a listener to engage with him, and a reason to be reminded why he was so exciting in the first place.

The band is called Let Freedom Swing, and in Thursday night’s early set it played “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho” as a hard-bop minor-key blues; “Walk With Me Jesus” with a Coltrane-quartet slow groove; “Lift Every Voice and Sing” as a lovely, ruminative solo piano piece; a calypsolike “We Shall Overcome”; and a version of Herbie Hancock’s strange bossa nova “I Have a Dream.”

You see the thread. It was music of black American pride and liberation, well timed for a run that began on Inauguration Day. But somehow it didn’t feel programmatic. You were hearing music more than concept, which is consistent with Mr. Chestnut’s entire career and perhaps why his gigs can be so much more satisfying than his records.

Nevertheless, this band should make a record. Mr. Chestnut is stretching himself. It was good to hear him incorporate a little bit of Mr. Hancock’s slippery harmonic nuance. (In the past his influences have seemed to extend through jazz of the mid-’50s, skip the ’60s entirely and resume with pop and gospel of the ’70s.)
819 2009-01-24 And the lessons learned are useful not just to those who once got seven- and eight-figure Wall Street bonuses but also to anyone overextended and struggling to keep up with monthly payments.

RE-EVALUATE The first thing on your list should be to take a long, hard look at what you have, what you need and what you can afford. This may seem like an odd exercise for someone who has been earning a lot of money for many years. But the combination of a precipitous drop in income and a decrease in the value of your portfolio — particularly for those with concentrated positions in bank stocks — has upended household balance sheets. One rule of thumb is that when liabilities dwarf assets, it’s time to cut and run.

Robert Elliott, senior managing director at Bessemer Trust, says people need to realize that bonuses were always discretionary and that they are unlikely to return to their high levels anytime soon. “What are my core expenditures? What are my discretionary expenditures?” he asked. If you can’t cut back and get down to your base salary, he added, “Then you’ve geared your lifestyle way beyond your needs.”

GOODBYE BEACH HOUSE The first thing to go should be the secondary residence. If you bought a summer house by pledging stock that has lost more than half its value, you are looking at a serious margin call. When a private bank lent you $10 million and you had bank stock worth $100 million, that was a conservative loan on the bank’s part — only 10 percent of your net worth. Now that your stock is worth $50 million, the loan-to-value ratio on your beach house is not looking as solid for the bank.

While it may crush you to sell your mansion in the Hamptons in such a depressed real estate market, it is better than going through a forced restructuring. “People have to be prepared for three to four years of diminished expectations,” Mr. Haverstick said.

REFOCUS This is no time for assets that don’t produce income — particularly those with high carrying costs. Second and third homes fall into this category. But so do multiple nannies, yachts and horse farms. People who are overextended need to act as if the good old days are gone forever. In this economy, covering living expenses from your cash flow will leave you better positioned for when the economy picks up.

DON’T DOUBLE DOWN Believing Wall Street has run out of ways to make lots of money is like betting against Tiger Woods: you’ll most likely lose. But you have to think like Mr. Woods as he recovers from knee surgery: the key now is patience. If your portfolio has lost 45 percent, putting what you have left into investments that could yield 25 percent but could also go bust is not a wise decision. This may seem obvious, but in tough times people get desperate.

DOUBLE WHAMMY. Your bonus may have left you scrambling to reorganize your assets and liabilities. Shares in your company may be cheaper than a Starbuck’s latte, but be thankful if you are not required to own company stock pegged to your compensation.

Robert Barbetti, managing director and executive compensation specialist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank, says many high-ranking executives are required to own stock in their company worth five to six times their annual compensation. It doesn’t take a hedge fund wizard to do the math here: if a company’s share price has plunged 50 percent, top executives are going to have to double their holdings to reach the required level.

One way that companies help executives meet this requirement is to increase the percentage of their compensation that is in stock. Mr. Barbetti says that for some, this could be as high as 70 percent of their compensation this year, which means these executives could find themselves dealing with the same personal liquidity issues. On this, the Wall Street executives who made a show of declining their bonuses may again be ahead of the game: by not taking the bonuses, they are lowering the percentage between compensation and the stock they hold.

RAY OF HOPE Here is one bit of good news. People who had deferred compensation plans before 2005 may be able to access them now. The 2004 American Jobs Creation Act froze the account values in existing plans on the last day of that year. If your old plan allows it, you can withdraw the money you accumulated up to that point. You will have to pay a 10 percent penalty — as well as ordinary income tax on the amount you take out — but it is a quick cash fix. Consider it the high-net-worth equivalent of tapping your 401(k) plan for a low-interest loan. It is not desirable but it works as a stop gap.

While the gloom in the financial system is unlikely to abate before the second half of this year, making tough decisions now could salvage what is left. “The message is resonating and it’s uncomfortable,” Mr. Elliott said. But uncomfortable now is better than insolvent down the road.
820 2009-01-24 Drinking coffee may do more than just keep you awake. A new study suggests an intriguing potential link to mental health later in life, as well.

A team of Swedish and Danish researchers tracked coffee consumption in a group of 1,409 middle-age men and women for an average of 21 years. During that time, 61 participants developed dementia, 48 with Alzheimer’s disease.

After controlling for numerous socioeconomic and health factors, including high cholesterol and high blood pressure, the scientists found that the subjects who had reported drinking three to five cups of coffee daily were 65 percent less likely to have developed dementia, compared with those who drank two cups or less. People who drank more than five cups a day also were at reduced risk of dementia, the researchers said, but there were not enough people in this group to draw statistically significant conclusions.

Dr. Miia Kivipelto, an associate professor of neurology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and lead author of the study, does not as yet advocate drinking coffee as a preventive health measure. “This is an observational study,” she said. “We have no evidence that for people who are not drinking coffee, taking up drinking will have a protective effect.”

Dr. Kivipelto and her colleagues suggest several possibilities for why coffee might reduce the risk of dementia later in life. First, earlier studies have linked coffee consumption with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, which in turn has been associated with a greater risk of dementia. In animal studies, caffeine has been shown to reduce the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, coffee may have an antioxidant effect in the bloodstream, reducing vascular risk factors for dementia.

Dr. Kivipelto noted that previous studies have shown that coffee drinking may also be linked to a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease.
821 2009-01-24 “Blink,” the mega-best-seller by Malcolm Gladwell, is about the importance of first impressions, and Mr. Gladwell’s belief that “those instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good.” Case in point, it turns out, is the banking crisis. It sure looks like the government’s first impression about how to save the banks was the right one, after all.

“It’s pretty clear that the bad assets are the problem,” Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told me, somewhat ruefully, not long ago. Mr. Frank, you’ll recall, had championed the legislation for the original Troubled Asset Relief Program last September when the financial system appeared to be on the verge of collapse. The plan had been sold to him  and the rest of Congress  by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, as a way to begin buying up toxic assets and taking them off the banks’ balance sheets. No sooner was the $700 billion package passed, though, that Mr. Paulson abruptly changed course and used the money to recapitalize the banking system instead.

Everywhere I’ve turned these last few weeks, I’ve heard variations of the same refrain. “The original Paulson plan had it right  they had to get the bad assets off the banks,” said Ronald J. Kruszewski, the chief executive of the investment firm of Stifel Nicolaus & Company. “Before you are going to get intelligent capitalists to invest their money in the banks, you have to get these landmines off their balance sheets,” said Brett Duval Fromson, the managing partner of the Margin of Safety Fund. “The reason things are frozen is that nobody knows if the banks are insolvent or not  thanks to the bad assets on their books,” said Henry F. Owsley of the Gordian Group, an investment bank that specializes in “distressed situations.”

“If they wanted to follow the R.T.C. script, they would come to the immediate conclusion that they have to get assets out of the banks, and establish a market clearing price,” said Tim Ryan, head of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The R.T.C., of course, was the Resolution Trust Corporation, which managed (and sold) the bad assets on the books of banks during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, Mr. Ryan led the Office of Thrift Supervision, and helped direct the response to that crisis.

It’s pretty much unanimous, in other words. With a new administration, and a new economic team  which includes former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker, who was among the first to publicly call on the government to begin buying bad assets  it seems clear that dealing with the bad assets should be one of the first orders of business. So how do we go about it?

Before we go there, let’s quickly take stock. On Wednesday, during his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy F. Geithner applauded the senators for passing the original TARP legislation, saying that “your actions helped prevent financial catastrophe.” Whether, in fact, TARP did the trick is open to debate, but things surely aren’t as dire now as they were then. Thanks largely to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, the commercial paper market has thawed, and banks are lending to each other again  if not to the rest of us. Customers aren’t racing to pull their money out of the banking system and stuff it under a mattress.

Most important, the government has made clear it will not allow a major bank to default, to avoid the replay of the Lehman catastrophe. (Though it would have been nice if Mr. Geithner, who had been involved as head of the New York Fed, had acknowledged that the Lehman default was a terrible mistake. Instead, he fell back on the old “there was nothing we could do” dodge. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.) The government showed its determination to stick by this thinking when it rushed in to shore up the faltering Bank of America.

L. William Seidman, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  and who, like Mr. Ryan, was deeply involved in getting us through the S.& L. crisis  describes the current approach as “muddling through.” He added, “If you can muddle through, it is a lot more pleasant than what we had to do.” Without question, if we keep taking the current approach  throwing more capital at a bank whenever it falls into crisis because of its mounting losses  eventually the losses will end. They have to someday.

But Mr. Geithner strongly implied in his testimony that muddling through was no longer acceptable, and he’s right, for two reasons. The first is that it lacks the appearance of fairness. When the government concluded that Washington Mutual was struggling to remain solvent, it forced a fire sale to the stronger JPMorgan Chase. Yet Bank of America, which has made a series of disastrous acquisitions, gets government support.

“We need to know what the rules are,” complained Michael Mayo, the veteran banking analyst for Deutsche Bank. He pointed to the even more egregious case of National City Bank of Cleveland, which had a capital ratio higher than most banks that are still standing. Yet it was refused TARP funds, and was forced to merge with PNC, which got as its reward National City’s share of the TARP money. The government might argue that National City was going to be pulled down into insolvency because of inevitable losses in the months to come  and that may well be true. But how many other banks are in the exact same position, yet remain alive and will continue to receive support?

Muddling through will take years  and we don’t have years. We’re not trying to save the banking system for its own sake. We’re not doing it to help shareholders or even bondholders. We’re not even doing it to save the taxpayer. The core issue is that the longer the banking industry struggles, the longer it will take for the recovery to kick in.

The urgency, in other words, is not about the banks. It’s about the rest of us. This is about pushing along an economic recovery, which won’t happen until banks start lending again. Which they can’t do until they are healthy again. Which they won’t be, as long as they have assets on their balance sheets that they must keep writing down, quarter after blessed quarter.

During the time it was using TARP money to shore up the banking system, the Bush Treasury Department bent over backward to prevent shareholders from being wiped out, while at the same time trying to protect taxpayers. In retrospect, that never really made much sense. The preferred shares the government got in return for its money have indeed helped protect taxpayers  and have also kept shareholders from being diluted. But because it is sheltered behind the common equity held by shareholders  and is expected to be paid back  it can’t really be put to use. As the losses wipe out tangible common equity, the preferred shares just sit there, doing little or nothing to help the banks.
822 2009-01-24 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Intel Corporation, the chip maker, said Friday that its chairman, Craig R. Barrett, who steered the company through the dot-com collapse and has become a high-profile advocate for expanding computing in the developing world, plans to retire in May.

Mr. Barrett, 69, has spent more than three decades at Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif. He served as its fourth chief executive, a position he held for seven years until Paul S. Otellini took over in 2005.

The company said that Jane Shaw, a former pharmaceutical industry executive who has served on Intel’s board since 1993, would succeed Mr. Barrett. Ms. Shaw will serve as nonexecutive chairman.

Mr. Barrett’s tenure as chief executive was marked by his commitment to sustaining Intel’s aggressive investments in its factories during the prolonged slump that followed the dot-com slump. The strategy was seen as foolhardy by some investors as Intel’s profits shriveled, but it paid off: Intel’s cutting-edge factories are critical to maintaining its advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and making chips cheaper and more powerful.

In recent years, Mr. Barrett has worked with the United Nations and humanitarian organizations on bringing computers and other technologies to developing countries. That role also gave him an opportunity to push the inexpensive Classmate PCs that Intel designed for international schoolchildren. The Classmate has rivaled the nonprofit One Laptop Per Child project began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Mr. Barrett, who joined Intel in 1974 and has held jobs ranging from technology development manager to various vice president roles, has been chairman since 2005.

824 2009-01-25 The forest green has long healed in Shanksville, Pa., where Flight 93 crashed as its passengers gave their lives struggling against the hijackers of 9/11. Further healing is at hand with the end of rancorous, shameful delay in creating a memorial to honor the 40 passengers and crew.

A running fight over land prices threatened the planned opening — on 9/11/11, the flight’s 10th anniversary — of the first and most sacred part of the memorial: the precise site where the plane plunged into the earth. Breaking the deadlock required a personal plea from the victims’ long-suffering families to George W. Bush in his final days as president.

Congress had already authorized the memorial; the major obstacle was the government’s reluctance to condemn and take possession of the acreage that would form the centerpiece of the memorial. The victims’ families had worked tirelessly on their own to assemble surrounding parcels through donations. Absent an order for eminent domain, however, the National Park Service and the principal landowner were left to engage in unseemly haggling over prices for the core site — an old strip mine sward that is now, de facto, a cemetery.

Mr. Bush finally agreed that condemnation was the best course and ordered the Department of the Interior to seek a settlement in court. The Park Service agreed to take immediate possession so work can begin on preparing the site in time for the 10th-anniversary opening.

The Flight 93 families should not have been put through all this; having to wait while the contending parties haggled over price was particularly reprehensible. The families’ resolve to fight through to a solution is a memorial in itself to their lost loved ones’ defense of the nation.
825 2009-01-25 Some people claim that Barack Obama’s election has ushered in a “postracial” America, but the truth is that race, and racial discrimination, are still very much with us. The Supreme Court should keep this reality in mind when it considers a challenge to an important part of the Voting Rights Act that it recently agreed to hear. The act is constitutional — and clearly still needed.

Section 5, often called the heart of the Voting Rights Act, requires some states and smaller jurisdictions to “preclear” new voting rules with the Justice Department or a federal court. When they do, they have to show that the proposed change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating against minority voters.

When Congress enacted Section 5 in 1965, officials in the South were creating all kinds of rules to stop blacks from voting or being elected to office. Discrimination against minority voters may not be as blatant as it was then, but it still exists. District lines are drawn to prevent minorities from winning; polling places are located in places hard for minority voters to get to; voter ID requirements are imposed with the purpose of suppressing the minority vote.

After holding lengthy hearings to document why the Voting Rights Act was still needed, Congress reauthorized it in 2006 with votes of 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House. Now, a municipal utility district in Texas that is covered by Section 5 is arguing that it is unconstitutional, and that it imposes too many burdens on jurisdictions covered by it.

If the Supreme Court — which is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring — strikes down Section 5, it would be breaking radically with its own precedents. The court has repeatedly upheld the Voting Rights Act against challenges, and as recently as 2006 it ruled that complying with Section 5 is a compelling state interest. It would also be an extreme case of conservative judicial activism, since the 14th and 15th Amendments expressly authorize Congress to enact laws of this sort to prevent discrimination in voting.

A perennial criticism of Section 5 is that it covers jurisdictions it should not, or fails to cover ones it should. There is no way to construct a perfect list, but Congress has done a reasonable job of drawing up the criteria, and it has built flexibility into the act. Jurisdictions are allowed to “bail out” if they can show that they no longer need to be covered, and courts can add new jurisdictions if they need to be covered.

In last fall’s election, despite his strong national margin of victory — and hefty campaign chest — Mr. Obama got only about one in five white votes in the Southern states wholly or partly covered by Section 5. And there is every reason to believe that minority voters will continue to face obstacles at the polls.
826 2009-01-25 “We wanted to put together a mosaic of what was happening in different places that would turn into a chronicle of the day,” said one of the organizers, Eric Benson, 24, a freelance writer.

The idea for the project came from Justin Nobel, 27, a science writer and intern at Audubon magazine, who was inspired by the Mass Observation movement that emerged in England in the 1930s, led by intellectuals who believed that the most revealing way to document an event was to report the peripheral activities surrounding it.

The English observers embarked on their most ambitious venture on May 12, 1937, when they arranged for about 200 people to spread throughout London during the coronation of King George VI.

“I think there’s a lot of power in observing the minutiae,” Mr. Nobel said. “By itself, one observation might not mean that much, but when you have this whole sweep of observations over time, it adds up to something.”

Mr. Nobel said he had long been intrigued by the possibilities of observation — sometimes he stands or sits in a single spot in New York for hours focusing intently on the goings-on. One Sunday in 2007, he said, he spent 14 hours riding the No. 1 train between Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and South Ferry in Manhattan, noting what transpired and posting the results on a Web site, absurdadventurer.blogspot.com.

Five days before the inauguration, Mr. Nobel and Mr. Benson created the Web site for their project and spread the word that they were looking for volunteers. They asked contributors to send descriptive and narrative accounts; anything that sounded like punditry or opinion was forbidden.

More than 200 people joined a Facebook group dedicated to the project.

Participants began posting items the weekend before the inauguration, contributing overheard snippets of conversations, vignettes and lengthy physical descriptions.

Some of the results resemble haikus. Others are breezy and impressionistic. Entries were sent to the Web site by e-mail and Twitter. They came from Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America and across the United States.

At 11:42 on Tuesday, shortly before Mr. Obama was to appear at a lectern, a contributor in New York wrote, “Fifteen people in a car dealership in Harlem anticipate the announcement of the president-elect’s name.” Exactly two hours later, somebody in Maine posted, “Our 2-year-old daughter said ‘Obama’ a few times without prompting.”

Mr. Nobel himself was in Washington on Tuesday, posting descriptions of the tableaus he encountered on the crowded streets near the National Mall. At one point a woman berated him for eavesdropping on her conversation and taking notes. Later, after being turned away from the ticketed viewing area, he joined a group of people listening to Mr. Obama’s inauguration address on a car radio.

Mr. Benson stayed in New York, glued to a computer screen for 16 hours, receiving and posting dispatches from participants in the project.

“As the day went on I realized I was observing all the observers,” he said. “It had this meta quality. I loved it when the observers became as interesting as their observations.”
827 2009-01-25 Already, a handful of REITs, including Aimco Properties and UDR, have announced plans to distribute stock as part of their special dividends.

At least one REIT — Vornado Realty Trust — has signaled its intention of reducing cash payouts in regular dividends. Vornado said it would pay 60 percent of its first-quarter common dividend in the form of new stock and 40 percent in cash; if it paid 60 percent of its dividends in stock in all four quarters, it could preserve nearly $400 million in cash this year. (The company, though, reserved the right to pay an all-cash dividend.)

How is the investment world reacting to these changes?

“We don’t know how it’s going to play out,” said Louis W. Taylor, a managing director at Deutsche Bank Securities. “But there’s certainly a lot of strong, diverse opinion being voiced. The investment universe is definitely split on this.”

On the one hand, some money managers and industry analysts hope that the dividend modifications will help shore up certain REIT balance sheets and, in the long run, share prices, by allowing strapped companies to preserve more capital.

Others, though, are calling the temporary changes “shareholder unfriendly,” especially for those investors looking to stay more liquid themselves, rather than accumulate additional shares that might be declining in value. (The tax implications are the same for cash or stock dividends.)

“If you own a REIT, it’s because it’s going to pay you dividends — that is the attraction right now,” said Paul D. Puryear, the director of real estate research at Raymond James & Associates. “You ought to get paid while you wait” for Wall Street to stabilize, he added, “and we could be waiting for a while.”

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which had sought the dividend changes, maintains that they are necessary right now, in large part because financing is harder to come by, both from banks and the debt markets. (The trade group had pushed to make the modifications permanent, at an 80 percent stock ceiling, the same level permitted a half-dozen or so REITs in private I.R.S. rulings over the last few years.)

“The credit crisis is very real and very significant,” said Tony M. Edwards, the executive vice president and general counsel of the REIT association. “This is just one of a number of things companies can do to help themselves in this environment and to conserve cash.”

He cited an analysis by Merrill Lynch estimating that REITs would retain about $17 billion in cash over all — money that could be used to retire or buy back debt, or for other purposes — by restructuring the dividend payout. (The estimate was on the assumption that the I.R.S. guidance would be extended through 2010.)

Mr. Edwards also maintained that a significant number of REIT investors might not even notice any changes because many of them automatically reinvest the dividends, in some cases through dividend reinvestment programs, or DRIPs. “So, effectively, in those cases, they won’t find any difference,” he said.

Still, the bigger issue, said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, is that investors effectively are losing the right to decide for themselves (although he noted that they could immediately cash in a stock dividend).

“Shareholders make a conscious decision to participate in a program like DRIPs, and you often get stock at a discount to the current market price,” he said. “This takes the choice away from these shareholders.”

Some industry analysts also worry that issuing more stock to pay dividends might dilute the value of existing shares, while others contend that the move runs contrary to one of the main selling points of REITs: income.

“Investors have been sold a REIT story that includes high-yielding-cash-dividend-paying stocks, and that’s an attractive story in many eyes,” said Mike Kirby, a principal in Green Street Advisors, a research company.

In a recent report, his company described the change in composition of Vornado’s coming dividend as “functionally analogous to a dividend cut.” The main difference, the report said, is that “shareholders will now have more pieces of paper representing ownership of the same economic pie.”

But Green Street also called the decision prudent: “Capital preservation should take precedence over the other considerations.” It noted that Vornado, which owns office and retail space and has a lower-than-average leverage ratio, took the action as a “proactive step to further enhance liquidity.”

Michael J. Salinsky, a vice president of equity research for RBC Capital, said that reducing cash payouts “does provide additional short-term liquidity.” He likened the temporary modifications more to stock splits than dividend cuts.

“So if you have one share, say, you now have 1.2 shares but the total value is the same, only at a larger base,” he said.

Mr. Taylor of Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, estimated that only a small percentage of REITs were likely to take advantage of the new I.R.S. guidance this year — some to deal with financing issues, and others to prevent future problems.

And what should an investor look for in gauging the financial health of a REIT?

“Three things: it’s leverage, leverage, leverage,” Mr. Taylor said. “In this environment you want to look for companies with lower leverage and clear funding capabilities.”

SOME analysts said they wouldn’t be surprised to see more REIT dividend cuts or even suspensions of dividends this year.

“With the capital markets closed down, and now that a number of companies have gone down this path, there’s no longer quite as much stigma attached,” Mr. Lindemann said.

Others think that in the long run, investors are still likely to view such moves as a sign of weakness.

“The companies that are able to pay dividends through this down cycle are going to be rewarded coming out of the other side,” Mr. Puryear said.
828 2009-01-25 This isn’t necessarily a criticism of those systems. After all, one can beat the market over the long haul by outperforming the averages during rallies and merely matching them during declines. But the systems’ sizable fourth-quarter losses offer a reality check on what we can reasonably expect in bear markets.

Consider a fund ranking system based on momentum. Much research has found that stock funds with the best performance over the trailing 6 to 12 months tend to keep outperforming for up to an additional year.

Yet during the fourth quarter, the model portfolio of No-Load Fund*X, a newsletter that picks funds mechanically according to momentum, lost 22.3 percent, according to the digest.

More obscure fund ranking systems that have received even stronger academic seals of approval also couldn’t avoid the markets’ steep decline. One such system is based on a mathematical technique, the Kalman Filter, which was first used by engineers to better filter out noise in signals received from navigational devices. According to Alpha Investment Opportunities, a firm whose approach is based on this research, the funds that were top-ranked by this approach lost 22.2 percent in the quarter.

Another system that has shown great promise in research is the Return Gap model. It favors funds whose actual returns are furthest ahead of what they would have been had they kept holding — without any changes — the stocks listed in their most recent public disclosures. But according to a study by the digest, this model lost 20.6 percent in the quarter (based on the long-only domestic equity funds with the biggest return gaps, as identified by MutualDecisions.com).

Though such losses are clearly disappointing, they shouldn’t be a surprise, said Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor, in an interview. That’s because the return of the stock market itself is the greatest determinant of the typical equity fund’s return, he said.

He referred to a mutual fund’s beta — how much it moves in lock step with the overall market. An index fund that tracks the overall market has a beta of 1.0; he said that the betas of very few actively managed stock funds fall much below 1.0 and that a beta below 0.5 is “extremely rare.”

And betas tend to increase during bear markets, he said. Funds whose performances diverge widely when the market is rising still tend to fall more or less in unison in severe bear markets.

Of course, a good fund can perform better than its beta predicts. But this additional amount, known as alpha, is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fund’s beta effect. “It’s very difficult in a down market for a fund’s alpha to overcome its beta,” Professor Wermers said.

As a result, he concluded, it’s unrealistic for stock fund investors to expect to weather a quarter like the last one without double-digit losses, even if they follow a ranking system with impeccable long-term credentials.

TO have sidestepped such losses in the last quarter, a stock fund investor would have had to be in cash. But market timing is notoriously hard.

Consider the contrasting stock market forecasts that prevailed at the end of the third quarter among the 10 best- and 10 worst-performing market timing newsletters of the 200 monitored by the digest. These groups were defined on the basis of risk-adjusted market-timing performance over the previous 15 years — seemingly long enough to separate out those with superior ability. Yet at the start of the fourth quarter, the 10 best, on average, were far more bullish than the 10 worst.

So, to have had good odds of avoiding the fourth quarter’s losses, an investor would have had to choose on some basis other than past performance.

The bottom line is this: Periods like the last quarter are an inherent part of equity investing. Painful as they are, their very existence helps explain why stocks, in the long run, have outperformed safer investments. Without a risk premium, investors wouldn’t endure stocks’ ups and downs.

So think of the last quarter as the price we must pay to be equity investors. We’ve definitely paid our dues.
829 2009-01-25 A SUBPRIME SURGE The next error came in stages, from 2004 to 2007, as subprime lending grew from a small corner of the mortgage market into a large, dangerous one. Lending standards fell disgracefully, and dubious transactions became common.

Why wasn’t this insanity stopped? There are two answers, and each holds a lesson. One is that bank regulators were asleep at the switch. Entranced by laissez faire-y tales, they ignored warnings from those like Edward M. Gramlich, then a Fed governor, who saw the problem brewing years before the fall.

The other answer is that many of the worst subprime mortgages originated outside the banking system, beyond the reach of any federal regulator. That regulatory hole needs to be plugged.

FIDDLING ON FORECLOSURES The government’s continuing failure to do anything large and serious to limit foreclosures is tragic. The broad contours of the foreclosure tsunami were clear more than a year ago — and people like Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, were sounding alarms.

Yet the Treasury and Congress fiddled while homes burned. Why? Free-market ideology, denial and an unwillingness to commit taxpayer funds all played roles. Sadly, the problem should now be much smaller than it is.

LETTING LEHMAN GO The next whopper came in September, when Lehman Brothers, unlike Bear Stearns before it, was allowed to fail. Perhaps it was a case of misjudgment by officials who deemed Lehman neither too big nor too entangled — with other financial institutions — to fail. Or perhaps they wanted to make an offering to the moral-hazard gods. Regardless, everything fell apart after Lehman.

People in the market often say they can make money under any set of rules, as long as they know what they are. Coming just six months after Bear’s rescue, the Lehman decision tossed the presumed rule book out the window. If Bear was too big to fail, how could Lehman, at twice its size, not be? If Bear was too entangled to fail, why was Lehman not?

After Lehman went over the cliff, no financial institution seemed safe. So lending froze, and the economy sank like a stone. It was a colossal error, and many people said so at the time.

TARP’S DETOUR The final major error is mismanagement of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout fund. As I wrote here last month, decisions of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, about using the TARP’s first $350 billion were an inconsistent mess. Instead of pursuing the TARP’s intended purposes, he used most of the funds to inject capital into banks — which he did poorly.

To illustrate what might have been, consider Fed programs to buy commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities. These facilities do roughly what TARP was supposed to do: buy troubled assets. And they have breathed some life into those moribund markets. The lesson for the new Treasury secretary is clear: use TARP money to buy troubled assets and to mitigate foreclosures.

Six fateful decisions — all made the wrong way. Imagine what the world would be like now if the housing bubble burst but those six things were different: if derivatives were traded on organized exchanges, if leverage were far lower, if subprime lending were smaller and done responsibly, if strong actions to limit foreclosures were taken right away, if Lehman were not allowed to fail, and if the TARP funds were used as directed.

All of this was possible. And if history had gone that way, I believe that the financial world and the economy would look far less grim than they do today.

For this litany of errors, many people in authority owe millions of Americans an apology. Richard A. Clarke, former national security adviser, set a good example when he told the commission investigating the 9/11 attacks that he wanted victims’ families “to know why we failed and what I think we need to do to ensure that nothing like that ever happens again.” I’m waiting for similar words from our financial leaders, both public and private.
830 2009-01-25 The line is delivered without an I-know-you-know wink acknowledging that Microsoft is not the company likely to come first to mind when ease of use is mentioned. Songsmith works only on Windows, but the laptop in the video running Windows is a MacBook Pro, adorned with decorative stickers that obscure the Apple icon in the center.

The actor turns out to be Sumit Basu, a Microsoft research scientist, whose colleague, Dan Morris, another scientist, plays the role of the father. The two developed the software, along with Ian Simon, a graduate student at the University of Washington. The two also wrote the lyrics that they sang in the video — Songsmith supplied the rest of the music — and the production company wrote the dialogue, Mr. Morris said.

The pair had no intentions of producing satire. “We just wanted to make a fun video,” Mr. Morris said. He and Mr. Basu are computer scientists, not professional writers or actors. They relinquished their amateur status, however, when they decided to commercialize Songsmith themselves.

That they did so is highly unusual. At Microsoft Research, technology that seems to have some commercial application is typically moved elsewhere in the company, to a product group, so it can be converted into a saleable product and overseen by professional marketers. I asked Mr. Morris if Songsmith had been turned down by Microsoft product groups outside of his division. He declined to answer, saying only that the core technology might still be used elsewhere in the company.

The researchers eschewed the various open-source licensing models that would seem well suited to a project like this and instead released it as a commercial package: $29.95 in the United States, 29 euros in the European Union. Mr. Morris said the revenue would help to recoup development costs.

If it had remained as it was — a research project called MySong that was the subject of academic papers — it would not have drawn derision. But once it was placed on sale in Microsoft’s own online store, the whole world could weigh in with reviews.

The most devastating form of ridicule has been constructed by using the musical output of Songsmith itself. YouTube is now filling with hilarious videos in which the vocal tracks of rock classics have been fed into Songsmith and the ghastly computer-generated accompaniment has been recorded. One example was described by the blog Gizmodo: “David Lee Roth + Microsoft Songsmith = Pure Horror.”

When TechCrunch’s gadget blog first reported on the Songsmith video — “Microsoft Relinquishes ‘Worst Promo Video Ever’ Award to Another Department Within Microsoft” — it referred to a Microsoft-produced video made last April, when Vista Service Pack 1 was released. More than a million YouTube viewers have looked at this video, “Rockin’ Our Sales,” an homage to the “Born in the U.S.A.” album of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.

I must speak up in defense of that Vista video. It was made only for internal purposes, to fire up the Microsoft sales force to sell more copies of Vista (“Quota is where your focus is; got-ta get those bonuses”). It is so self-conscious in its ridiculousness that it’s impervious to external scorn.

Ms. Sontag also wrote that “when something is just bad (rather than Camp), it’s often because it is too mediocre in its ambition.” Not this video. Hearing Bruce ServicePack and the Vista Street Band sing at full voice, one is treated to pure camp.

I can’t offer the same apologia for Songsmith’s output when it transmutes the rock canon into synthetic treacle. The most excruciating Songsmith output I’ve run across on YouTube is a result of feeding the software vocals of the Beatles song “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” Listening to it, I wonder if software is now capable of thinking like a human being and can enjoy its own private jokes at our expense. If so, I suspect that Songsmith is snickering.
831 2009-01-25 These arrangements, struck privately by parties on both sides of a C.D.S. contract, have been extremely profitable to the Wall Street banks and insurers that traded in them.

Sellers of C.D.S.’s spent years raking in premiums while underestimating or simply ignoring the possibility of rising defaults. Regulators let the market grow unchecked.

In the end, far too much of this insurance was written at way too cheap a cost. Now, with Wall Street and the economy in tatters, the fear that already-hobbled financial companies may have to pay off huge amounts on C.D.S. arrangements hangs like a cloud over the markets.

C.D.S.’s have already figured prominently in taxpayer bailouts. The $150 billion rescue of the American International Group, for example, came about because of swaps the insurer had written on mortgage securities. And the $100 billion taxpayer backstop handed to Bank of America on Jan. 16 had a good bit to do with soured credit-default swaps that the bank inherited when it acquired Merrill Lynch.

“Credit-default swaps written on companies that were presumed not to be in danger of collapse but that are now on the brink — that is the overhang on the financial markets,” said Sylvain R. Raynes, a mathematics professor at Baruch College in New York and an expert in structured finance at R & R Consulting. “The financial system is frozen largely because of credit-default swaps.”

C.D.S.’s have introduced other economic burdens as well. Christopher Whalen, managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, argues that speculators who use credit protection to bet against financial institutions add instability to the system and cause the cost of taxpayer bailouts of the banks to escalate.

Normally, if a company goes bankrupt, a trustee steps in and helps it get back on its feet. The process can be brutal for creditors, suppliers and employees. But the ill effects of a bankruptcy are magnified if billions of dollars in insurance must also be paid out by companies that wrote protection on a beleaguered company’s debt.

While the amount of credit insurance outstanding is around $30 trillion, Robert Arvanitis, chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors in Westport, Conn., says he believes fully half that amount isn’t problematic because it consists of winning and losing stakes that offset each other.

But that still leaves $15 trillion worth of contracts that may be in need of triage.

What if a company that wrote insurance can’t produce the required payout when a default occurs? The buyer should take the hit, Mr. Arvanitis said.

“If you live in a house and you don’t buy reputable insurance and a fire burns it down, it’s your fault,” he said.

Yet as the huge A.I.G. rescue indicates, there’s a risk that errant C.D.S. bets could end up being the taxpayers’ problem anyway.

Obviously, something must be done to eliminate the possibility that taxpayers will wind up paying off entities that essentially bet against the American economy. And both Mr. Whalen and Mr. Raynes have ideas about how to do that.

First, a transparent and regulated exchange must be formed where swaps can trade and regulators overseeing the transactions can set margin requirements. Too many of the problems in the derivatives market stemmed from the fact that all the transactions occurred in a black box, which regulators chose not to open.

Also, little money was required up front, as a good-faith measure of an insurer’s ability to pay.

Mr. Whalen suggests that insurers be required to put up 50 percent of their net exposure on a contract. By doing so, they eliminate doubts about financing of credit-default swaps, he said.

He also recommends that regulators bar underwriters of credit protection from selling new insurance on financial institutions participating in the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program.

“It is absurd for the government to allow private speculators to profit by trading against public-guaranteed liabilities of banks,” Mr. Whalen said.

Mr. Raynes’s resolution is more radical: unwinding all outstanding credit-default swaps through a process he calls inversion.

Under this plan, insurance premiums would be refunded to buyers of credit protection from the entity that wrote the initial contract. And the seller would no longer be under any obligation to pay if a default occurred.

The premium repayments would be made over the same period and at the same rate that they were paid out. If a contract was struck three years ago and charged quarterly premiums, the premiums would then be refunded quarterly over the next three years.

Mr. Raynes’s proposal would treat hedgers — buyers who bought C.D.S.’s to protect themselves because they actually hold the underlying debt — differently from speculators who bought C.D.S.’s simply to bet against a troubled company.

Those guys, the gamblers, would receive only the premiums they paid to an insurer. Hedgers would have their premiums refunded, in addition to the difference between the underlying debt’s face value and an independent assessment of its intrinsic value.

For mortgage-related securities, this value would be ascertained by third-party analyses using loan servicing data on delinquencies, defaults and performing mortgages.

“If you stop the clock and reverse it, then the entire system will be able to breathe again,” Mr. Raynes said. “And over time, at the same speed that you got into the mess, you get out of it.”

Mr. Raynes’s proposal is online at creditspectrum.com, and Mr. Whalen’s plan is at institutionalriskanalytics.com (the “Institutional Risk Analyst” link on the left leads to a post on the right that begins “To Stabilize Global Banks”).

Credit-default swaps clearly played a role in this debacle, and it is crucial that they are part of the solution. It won’t be easy: Wall Street and other beneficiaries of the current setup will scream. But since they are among those who helped bring our economy to its knees, let’s try ignoring their objections.
832 2009-01-25 In the thick of the Girl Scout cookie season, it is becoming clear that labeling on some cookie boxes is a little thin.

The kosher symbol, intended to show consumers that the contents adhere to Jewish dietary laws, was mistakenly left off 14 million boxes of Thin Mints, the variety that accounts for roughly 25 percent of Girl Scout cookie sales, said Raymond Baxter, president and chief executive of Interbake Foods, the parent company of ABC Bakers of Richmond, Va., one of two approved manufacturers of the cookies.

Proofreaders missed the mistake. But a customer noticed in November that the symbol — a circled U accompanied by a D for dairy — was missing, said Brian Crawford, an executive at the Scouts’ New York headquarters. (Some troops sell cookies in the fall, though most sales are held January through March.)

ABC Bakers quickly sent letters explaining the oversight (and showing proof of kosher certification from the Orthodox Union) to Scout councils.

Rabbi Yisroel Bendelstein of the Orthodox Union, who has fielded perhaps a half-dozen calls about the cookies, said he hoped the letters would “obviate any concerns.”

Thin Mints, the rabbi said, are his favorite Girl Scout cookie.
833 2009-01-25 Officials said they want rules to eliminate conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies that gave top investment grades to the exotic and ultimately shaky financial instruments that have been a source of market turmoil. The core problem, they said, is that the agencies are paid by companies to help them structure financial instruments, which the agencies then grade.

“Until we deal with the compensation model, we’re not going to deal with the conflict of interest, and people are not going to have confidence that the ratings are worth relying on, worth the paper they’re printed on,” Mary L. Schapiro said in testimony earlier this month before being confirmed by the Senate to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, made similar comments in written and oral testimony before the Senate Finance Committee.

Aides said they would propose new federal standards for mortgage brokers who issued many unsuitable loans and are largely regulated by state officials. They are considering proposals to have the S.E.C. become more involved in supervising the underwriting standards of securities that are backed by mortgages.

The administration is also preparing to require that derivatives like credit default swaps, a type of insurance against loan defaults that were at the center of the financial meltdown last year, be traded through a central clearinghouse and possibly on one or more exchanges. That would make it significantly easier for regulators to supervise their use.

Officials said that the proposals were aimed at the core regulatory problems and gaps that have been highlighted by the market crisis. They include lax government oversight of financial institutions and lenders, poor risk management efforts by banks and other financial companies, the creation of exotic financial instruments that were not adequately supported by their issuing companies, and risky and ill-considered borrowing habits of many homeowners whose homes are now worth significantly less than their mortgages.

“I believe that our regulatory system failed to adapt to the emergence of new risks,” Mr. Geithner said in a written response to questions that was made public on Friday by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. “The current financial crisis has exposed a number of serious deficiencies in our federal regulatory system.”

The regulatory changes are a major piece of a broader package being prepared by the new administration to address the market crisis. Another piece to be issued soon will provide the strategy for how the government will go about repairing the declining banking industry. Congress recently approved the second $350 billion in spending from the Troubled Assets Relief Program.

The White House has come under increasing political and market pressure to disclose how it intends to manage the program, and there is nervous expectation on Capitol Hill that the administration will need to spend more than $350 billion. That plan is expected to focus on reducing foreclosures, revising the bank bailout program, and buying or issuing guarantees for the rapidly deteriorating assets that have been discouraging more private investment in the banks.

Senior aides have vowed to move quickly on the administration’s financial regulatory agenda. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, approved last fall, requires the White House to make regulatory recommendations to Congress by April 30, although the administration is preparing to make legislative and regulatory proposals sooner.

Mr. Obama is expected to make one of his first foreign trips to a summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 nations in London on April 2, and officials said the administration will have outlined the details of its proposed regulatory overhaul by then.

Officials have been grappling for nearly a year to figure out how to better oversee the financial system, particularly as a number of large and inadequately supervised companies have encountered problems. In a sweeping regulatory blueprint unveiled last March, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed a broad consolidation of banking and financial agencies, including merging the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That proposal is not included in the current plans.

Other elements of the regulatory overhaul, such as the requirement that hedge funds register with and be more closely supervised by the S.E.C., would mark a sharp departure from the policies of the Bush administration. Many hedge funds now voluntarily register and subject themselves to some regulation, but the Bush administration opposed attempts to make registration and tighter oversight mandatory, even though that was proposed by William H. Donaldson, a chairman of the commission appointed by President George W. Bush.

But other proposals the Obama administration is preparing to make, like tighter federal regulation of mortgage brokers, had been recommended in Mr. Paulson’s blueprint.

Officials said some credit default swaps with unique characteristics negotiated between companies might not be able to trade on exchanges or through clearinghouses. But standardized or uniform ones could.

“We want to make sure that the standardized part of those markets move into a central clearinghouse and onto exchanges as quickly as possible,” Mr. Geithner testified. “I think that’s really important for the system. It will help reduce risk and the system as a whole.”

The new trading procedures for derivatives could also enable regulators to impose capital and collateral requirements on companies that issue credit default swaps that would make them safer investments. American International Group, one of the largest issuer of such swaps, never had to post collateral and nearly collapsed as a result of issuing a huge volume of such instruments that it was unable to support.

Officials said the plan may include a broader role for the Federal Reserve in protecting the economy from companies whose troubles pose systemwide risks, as the report issued under the leadership of Mr. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, has proposed. The report was issued this month by a subcommittee of the Group of 30, a not-for-profit body of senior representatives from various governments and the private sector. The group’s members include Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council.

Administration officials have begun to study ways to control executive compensation.

For example, they are preparing proposals to limit executive pay at companies that receive money under the bank bailout program. In response to written questions by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Geithner said that in such circumstances the administration was planning to set a limit and that any compensation over that amount would “be paid in restricted stock or similar form that cannot be liquidated or sold until government assistance has been repaid.”

“Excessive executive compensation that provides inappropriate incentives,” Mr. Geithner said, “has played a role in exacerbating the financial crisis.”
834 2009-01-25 An article last Sunday about enduring words first spoken in Inaugural Addresses erroneously included two presidents’ well-known phrases. Lyndon B. Johnson first referred to “the Great Society” in a graduation speech at the University of Michigan in May 1964. And George H.W. Bush first used the phrase “a thousand points of light” in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican convention. (They later repeated the phrases in their Inaugural Addresses, in 1965 and 1989.)
835 2009-01-25 He had built one of the best-organized, best-trained bush armies in Africa. His soldiers always carried their rifles pointing down and kept their uniforms incongruously spotless, even though they marched through a world of mud.

But all that acclaimed discipline, which had helped the rebels to rout the Congolese government troops just about every time they faced off, seems to have vanished as fast as its leader.

On Saturday, Captain Amiable smelled like a beer bottle. His battle buddy, a young man named Sergeant Kompast, was not much better, with bloodshot eyes and a loaded assault rifle that kept slipping off his shoulder. The two teetered along the road, arm in arm, shouting at passing cars.

They were soon drowned out by a bunch of glassy-eyed rebels singing at the top of their lungs, “We are commandos, we are commandos!” as they were trucked out of town.

Few people in Kibumba seemed sad to see them go.

Several rebels said it was good that General Nkunda had been arrested.

“We always wanted to negotiate,” Captain Amiable said. “But Nkunda was blocking us.”

Peace, however, is far from assured. There are still many other rebel groups haunting the hills of eastern Congo. General Nkunda’s force was thought to number around 5,000 fighters, and many have simply melted back into the bush, possibly to fight on. His former chief of staff, Jean Bosco Ntaganda, a ruthless commander known as the Terminator, is the new rebel figurehead after having defected from General Nkunda.

So far Mr. Ntaganda is playing nice with the Congolese government. Though he has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court, he was the one holding court on Saturday. He met with various Congolese officials at a hotel near here, apparently to discuss the details of his newfound sense of cooperation.

As for General Nkunda, the Rwandans holding him remain tight-lipped.

“Nothing has changed,” Maj. Jill Rutaremara, a spokesman for Rwanda’s Defense Forces, said Saturday. “If Congo wants him extradited, there’s a process to go through.”

The Congolese government is urging Rwanda to hand him over to face war crimes and treason charges. But Rwanda may have a hard time doing that.

General Nkunda used to be a Rwandan Army officer, and until recently, top Rwandan officials were suspected of supplying him with weapons and soldiers. The Rwandan government seems to have struck a deal with Congo in which the Rwandans agreed to neutralize General Nkunda and in return Congo would let thousands of Rwandan troops hunt down Hutu militants on Congolese soil.

A joint Congolese-Rwandan force has killed nine Hutu militants in eastern Congo since Friday, Reuters reported.

837 2009-01-25 “If I don’t get to be the everyday player and I get to do the role they expect me to do, that will be great,” Vizquel said. “I think I can handle the situation very well.”

Vizquel’s 2,654 games at shortstop are a major league record. Only Ozzie Smith has won more Gold Gloves at shortstop (13), but Vizquel is the only shortstop to win the award multiple times in the American and the National Leagues.

“I feel kind of strange that I’m probably going to play second base or third base,” said Vizquel, who has never played third in the majors. His only game at second came in 1991 for Seattle.

The Rangers view Vizquel as a genuine utility player and backup, but his most important contribution could be mentoring Andrus, who was not yet a year old when Vizquel made his major league debut in 1989.

“We’re going to let that happen naturally,” General Manager Jon Daniels said.

Like his new teammate, Andrus is from Venezuela, where Vizquel is revered.

“I do think he’ll add a good deal to Elvis’s experience, but that’s not why we have him,” Daniels said. “We think he can add to this club on the field because he’s a quality person and comes with a tremendous pedigree. To the degree he helps Elvis, just setting the example in his work ethic and how he goes about his routine, that’s just a bonus.”

Vizquel will get a $1 million contract with a chance to earn more in performance bonuses if he makes the major league roster. He earned $5.3 million with San Francisco last season, when he had surgery on his left knee in spring training and then hit .222 with 23 runs batted in and 10 doubles in 92 games.

The Giants declined their 2009 contract option on Vizquel after he played four seasons there. Vizquel began his career with five seasons in Seattle, then went to two World Series with Cleveland from 1994 to 2004.

He is a .273 career hitter with 2,657 hits and 385 stolen bases in 2,680 games.

Having Vizquel around to mentor Andrus should allow Young to concentrate on learning his new position.

And with Young committed to the move after initially asking for a trade, Vizquel provides a viable option at shortstop should Andrus struggle.

“This helps protect us, if that comes to pass,” Daniels said. “But it’s really a hypothetical that we don’t expect to happen. We understand we’re pushing Elvis maybe a little quicker than some may have thought we would or should. But between his skill on the field and his makeup, we think he’s got the ability to handle it.”

Vizquel, the only Venezuelan-born player with at least 20 seasons in the majors, was the captain of Venezuela’s team during the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. He is on the provisional roster again for March, but said he would not play in the W.B.C.

“I think that I need to show the Texas Rangers I can still play,” Vizquel said. “I need to get used to everybody and the whole team. I’m going to enjoy my spring training.”
838 2009-01-25 Vonn holds a 240-226 lead over Gisin in the downhill.

DEFAGO WINS AGAIN Didier Defago of Switzerland won a World Cup downhill race in Kitzbühel, Austria, for his second victory in eight days. Bode Miller finished tied for fourth.

Defago charged down the famed Streif course in 1:56.09 to beat Michael Walchhofer of Austria by 0.17. He also won a World Cup downhill in his native Wengen last Saturday.

The 31-year-old Defago became the 12th racer in World Cup history to win classic downhill races in Wengen and Kitzbühel in the same year.

Klaus Kröll of Austria was third. Miller shared fourth place with Didier Cuche of Switzerland.

The race was interrupted for about 20 minutes after T. J. Lanning of the United States crashed into the safety nets. He injured his right knee and was taken to a hospital by helicopter as a precaution, the United States team spokesman Doug Haney said.

INJURY SIDELINES DAVIS Shani Davis of the United States was sidelined after cutting his right leg with his blade during the 500 meters at a speedskating World Cup event in Kolomna, Russia. Davis nicked his leg with 200 meters left and finished on one leg. He sat out the 1,000, which he leads in the World Cup standings. Davis, the overall world sprint champion, said he was not sure about competing Sunday.

Jenny Wolf of Germany set a track record in the 500, winning her seventh race of the season in 37.51 seconds. In the men’s race, Keiichiro Nagashima of Japan won in 34.85. Denny Morrison of Canada set a track record of 1:08.71 in the 1,000.

A FIRST FOR FINLAND Laura Lepisto rewarded an enthusiastic home crowd in Helsinki, Finland, by holding off Carolina Kostner of Italy to win Finland’s first women’s title at the European Figure Skating Championships. Her teammate Susanna Poykio won the bronze, the first time two Finnish skaters reached the European podium.

Kostner won the free skate but fell short of winning her third straight European title. Lepisto finished with 167.32 points; Kostner had 165.42.

It is only the second European title for a Finnish skater, and the first by a singles skater. Kostner was the heavy favorite coming into the competition, but she struggled in the short program.

RUSSIAN WINS BIATHLON Anna Boulygina of Russia rallied to win the 10-kilometer pursuit in a biathlon World Cup event in Anterselva, Italy.

Boulygina won in 32:49.8. Kaisa Makarainen of Finland was second, edging Darya Domracheva of Belarus in a photo finish. Domracheva had a poor start but managed to recover.

ITALIANS WIN IN LUGE Christian Oberstolz and Patrick Gruber of Italy won the luge doubles in Altenberg, Germany, for their fourth World Cup victory this season.

Natalie Geisenberger led a German sweep of the top four places in the women’s singles.

Oberstolz and Gruber won in a combined time of 1:24.996 for their 13th career win. With four wins in seven races, they lead the overall doubles standings with 580 points.

The German women have not lost a World Cup race in more than 11 years, and Geisenberger dominated the event by finishing the two runs in 1:46.283.
839 2009-01-25 Thirty or forty minutes later, the phone rang. Bennie marched back to the kitchen, this time aware of how tired he was, and how few hours remained before sunrise. It was his twin sister, Gwen. She lived in New York.

"Littlefield said you didn't want me to come home. For a visit."

"Gwen?" he asked. "Do you know what time it is?"

"For a visit. You didn't want me around."

"Gwen, that's ridiculous. Come home. Of course I'd love to see you. What time is it? Are you drunk?"

"You shouldn't believe Littlefield when he says something like that. He's just messing with you."

"I guess I just wanted to make sure. Could I visit next week sometime?"

"It's your house, too. Of course you can visit. I'd love you to visit. I'm kind of asleep right now. Can I call you back?"

"He's out. Down at Julian's, I think."

"Eddie's, the bar. Now they call it Julian's. Julian is Eddie's son."

"Right. That tall guy. I remember him. Really, really tall. Like a freak."

"Will you pick me up at the airport?"

"Next week. When I come."

"I'll be there for our birthdays," she said.

Growing up, they'd always celebrated together — they were born only fifteen minutes apart, on either side of midnight. "That'd be nice," he said. "I'm going to sleep now."

"Wow. Somebody's grumpy. Next time, just don't answer the phone. We'll all be happier," she said, and hung up.

As he tried to sleep, he thought about their old family house — its leaky pipes, chipping paint, uneven floors, drafty windows. Baby raccoons in the walls. They called it "the Manse," which had been a family joke, because the house was not grand or impressive compared to others along the coast, but now that Bennie and Littlefield were in charge, and the porch seemed one or two strong storms away from crumbling into the ocean, and the old copper pipes were failing, rotting the ceilings and the walls, calling the place "the Manse" seemed sad. The last time Gwen had come to visit them — the previous summer — she and Bennie had been sitting on the porch, drinking beer, discussing Gwen's latest rationale for living in New York and continuing her quest to be an actress. Gwen said that pretending to be another person was invigorating. Bennie wanted to relate this to his own experience, so after he let his sister finish, he took a big sip of beer and said that paintball was a pretty good outlet for pretending, too.

He told her that paintball taught him to be careful, and patient, and that he and Littlefield and Julian went out together, competing against a group of sea urchin divers at a year-round course called the Flying Dutchman, sometimes going for a full session without taking more than two or three shots. Two or three gumballs, hopefully kill shots, full of bright-colored sludge. They played every Saturday.

When Bennie looked at her after describing this, he knew they were both having the same thought: there'd been a lot of promise, once. According to their mom at least. He'd done pretty well in high school. They were the grandchildren of an original member of the Stock Exchange. But while Gwen had decided at Vassar to be an actress (it took her a few years to get to New York, and she wasn't doing much acting, but she'd landed two small roles at the Brooklyn Family Theater in Park Slope and she had a gig as a temp at an accounting firm), Bennie hadn't finished college. He thought there might be a time when he'd start up again — when he would have good ideas about how to put a college degree to use in midcoast Maine — but for now he just wanted to keep the Manse from falling apart. Working at the vet's office, taking care of the house — that was plenty. He and Gwen were about to turn twenty-seven.

The front door banged shut, and from his bed Bennie heard Littlefield knocking his boots against the wall, depositing, Bennie was sure, lumps of snow on the kitchen floor. Bennie heard the sink faucet turn on, and the clink of a glass. Littlefield tromped into the living room. After a brief silence, he said, "My [expletive] saber saw. Don't use my saber saw."

"I'm asleep," said Bennie. When they'd moved back into the old house, Bennie had chosen the downstairs bedroom. Most of the time, it was convenient, but there were occasional disadvantages to sleeping near the front door.

"Whoa! Did you cut a hole in the wall?"

Bennie flipped his light on and came to the doorway. "Take off your boots when you come inside."

Littlefield was poking the ashes in the fire, trying to find the coals. He was wearing a black sweatshirt with the hood up. "Those are my sardines in the trap out there."

"Has it sprung yet?" asked Bennie.

"That's no way to catch an animal. Have a heart? Please. Have some balls, Bennie. That's a better motto when you're catching an animal. Have. Some. Balls. Some scrotal ballast. I should design a grow-a-pair trap and force you to use it. A giant glue trap — with a guillotine."

"Did you look closely? Maybe it's already sprung," Bennie said, walking to the kitchen. It felt satisfying to ignore his brother's latenight bluster. Bennie held open the door and they walked onto the porch.

In his underwear, Bennie shone the flashlight at the trap. The beam sparkled on the empty trap's galvanized metal. "Did you talk to Gwen?"

"She called tonight. She said you said we didn't want her to visit."

They walked back inside, Bennie holding the door again. Littlefield said, "No. I told her you didn't want her to visit."

Bennie felt a familiar anger rise in his chest. "What? Why?"

Littlefield crumpled newspaper and laid it on the andirons. "Where's the kindling box?"

"We're out of kindling," said Bennie. He grabbed a wool blanket from the back of the couch, wrapped it around himself, and sat in the rocking chair.

"I'll go chop some," said Littlefield.

"Hold on," said Bennie. "There's some in the kitchen." He retrieved the cardboard box from the mop closet and brought it to the living room, set it down gently, and opened it. The raccoon babies were clumped together, a mass of wriggling fur, squeaking quietly.

He waited for his brother's reaction.

Finally, Littlefield said, "Do you see those rats in that box?"

"They were in the wall," said Bennie. "They were keeping me up. They're not rats. They're raccoons."

"And you put them in that box?"

"I didn't want you to poison them."

"They'll give you roundworm. The grubs can get into your stomach. They eat your kidneys and your heart."

"The grubs can get in your stomach?"

"If you swallow them."

Bennie knew it was rarely worth arguing details with Littlefield. He handed him the kindling and said, "I'm just trying to catch the mom. Then I'll let them all go."

"Get them the hell out of here. They're wild animals. They shouldn't be in here."

"After I catch the mom I'll bring them all down to the ravine."

Littlefield shook his head. He arranged the kindling on top of the newspaper. Bennie closed the box and returned it to the kitchen closet and poured himself a glass of milk. When he got back to the living room, the fire was towering, yellow flames lapping the entrance to the flue. Littlefield was sprawled out on the purple couch, still wearing his boots.

Bennie asked, "Why'd you say that to Gwen?"

"Didn't you tell me you didn't want my friends coming around?"

"Just Skunk and those other guys living in his trailer." Skunk Gould and Littlefield had thrown an impromptu party at the Manse in January when Bennie was away for the night. They'd broken windows in the living room and someone had pissed on the rocking chair.

"And that you wanted to keep the place neater?" asked Littlefield.

"And this has what to do with Gwen?"

"I told her you were dating some girl from Bowdoin. And you didn't want the house to look too messy. In case you brought her back here."

"Admit you do want to see your sister."

"I'd be happy to see Gwen."

"Admit you're just being an asshole," said Bennie. "And for the record, Helen's not from Bowdoin. She went to Bowdoin College. And she lives in Musquacook. She's a cook. At Julian's."

"Impressive! That's some real fine cuisine they have down there. I just had their onion rings about an hour ago. Five stars."

"Screw you. She puts together their dinner menu. That kitchen is actually doing a much better job since she started there."

"I'm so glad you enjoyed yourself, retard, but that's the fry cook, not Helen."

"What a shame," said Littlefield, closing his eyes.

Bennie wrapped himself in the wool blanket again. He rocked back and forth in the chair, staring at the fire. Both brothers were quiet. Within minutes, Littlefield was snoring on the couch.

840 2009-01-25 BEGINNING a decade ago, bank branches started popping out like spring wildflowers in a mountain meadow. The economy was on fire. Now, with a chill wind blowing through the finance industry, many branches will certainly disappear. By contrast, after the crash of 1929, bank construction continued along Madison Avenue with a quartet of elegant little bank structures, from 64th to 78th Streets.

As of 1930, only one bank stood on that stretch, the 1925 United States Mortgage and Trust Company at 74th Street, opposite the present Whitney Museum. But by 1934 there were four.

In 1930, the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company retained Cross & Cross, known for its sophisticated touch, to design a limestone branch bank just off the avenue at 35 East 72nd Street. The architects modeled their project after the designs of Robert Adam, the 18th-century Scottish architect. With muscular corner quoins — blocklike forms — and a gable over a projecting front, it could have been a men’s clubhouse. Indeed, Cross & Cross was also known for private clubs like the Links, on 62nd Street near Madison.

In 1931, Schultze & Weaver designed a scrumptious little four-story building at Madison and 73rd Street for the Fifth Avenue Bank, finished in 1932. This refined Georgian-style building has a steep mansard, marble trim and a delicate swan-neck pediment over the door. With its soft red brick, it could have been a women’s club.

Cross & Cross was also called on by the Fulton Trust Company in 1930 for its first branch bank since it was established in 1890. Built at 1002 Madison Avenue, near 78th, the subdued neo-Georgian in red brick has a bust of Robert Fulton at the top.

The chef-d’oeuvre of bank architecture along this stretch was begun in 1932 at the southwest corner of Madison and 64th Street by the Bank of the Manhattan Company, established in 1799.

The architect Morrell Smith made it three stories high, with gable ends, multipaned windows and molded brick, emulating a late-18th-century city house. Inside, there is a high barrel-vaulted front hall, scenic wallpaper and an elliptical stairway in line with the front door. Although pure reproduction, the rooms are some of the most elegant banking interiors in New York.
841 2009-01-25 At Pappas Pizza on Main Street, Juan Romero, manager, said he will probably dismiss one of his two delivery people because orders from corporations and hotels have dropped off. “UBS used to call in a big order every week,” he said. These days, the call for 15 to 20 large pies comes every two weeks.

At Montana for Men, a salon on Bank Street charging $45 to $60 for men’s haircuts, monthly clients now come every six or seven weeks; others have defected to their corner barbershops. “Some have been laid off, and others are watching their spending,” said Michael Warde, the owner.

Sublease space is plentiful as UBS and other companies that occupy so-called Class A space, the premier offices with top amenities, look for less-expensive space to cut their costs, said Bruce W. Sheldon, senior vice president of Pyramid Real Estate Group here. The priciest locations, downtown near the train station, rent for more than $50 a square foot.

“There are major companies trying to sublet 20,000 square feet,” Mr. Sheldon said. “That will take some time.” Meanwhile, “the tenant is still on the hook for the duration of the lease,” he said.

Because so much of the office space becoming available is sublease space, landlords as a group have not been hard hit, said Robert Caruso, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis’s Stamford office. The crunch for commercial buildings will come around 2015 when many commercial mortgage-backed securities are due to expire, he said.

In Greenwich, one of the financial world’s hedge-fund capitals, office rents averaged $70 a square foot last year, the top price in the county. As the pendulum swings back, Greenwich rents will likely plunge 25 percent, Mr. Fagan said. Its empty office space nearly doubled the last quarter of 2008, jumping to 11 percent from 6.2 percent a year earlier, although it is still low by comparison with Stamford and Hartford, which is about 18 percent.

As vacancies increase and rents fall, so do property values. Sale prices dropped from an average of $285 per square foot in 2007 to $146 a square foot. Owners of office buildings with low occupancy or loans coming due “could be in trouble because lending has come to a halt,” Mr. Fagan said.

A flat real estate market is bad news for cities that rely on related revenue sources, like conveyance taxes and permit fees, to supplement their operating budgets. For the current fiscal year ending June 30, Stamford budgeted $4.5 million for conveyance taxes and $11 million for permit fees. It’s unlikely it will collect more than $4 million in conveyance taxes, and the forecast on permit fees was revised to $6 million, said Mr. Freimuth. “A couple of major projects just aren’t getting started,” he said.

“There’s a multiplier effect,” Mr. Freimuth said. “Employment comes down as more space is vacant, so discretionary income drops. Restaurants and theaters feel it, and corporate giving to the arts and local organizations is down.”

At City Hall, budget projections are being revised daily, Mr. Freimuth said. Declines in state income taxes and sales tax receipts could translate into less state aid, he said.

Like other municipalities struggling to balance their budgets, Stamford is torn between raising property taxes or cutting services. “Everybody’s in this hold pattern,” Mr. Freimuth said. “The consequence of the drop in economic activity creates real pressure on the property tax. Or you can mitigate that with service cuts.”

All over the city, landlords are eager to strike deals. Office rents in the central business district were averaging $42 a square foot, and in this tenant’s market, Mr. Freimuth believes the average will drop to $40 or the high $30s. In less expensive areas of the city, a Summer Street property that would have leased for $18.50 or $19 a square foot two years ago just rented for an average of $17 a square foot over five years, Mr. Sheldon said.

Some owners are negotiating short-term leases and allowing tenants to rent for longer periods at lower prices. “Having someone stay two years is better than having them leave,” Mr. Fagan said.

What officials and real estate agents fear is that Stamford will look like less of a bargain as Manhattan landlords lower rents, and that keeping occupancy up for the next two years will be trying, they said.

But when capital starts to flow, opportunities will arise, brokers said. “There’s nothing wrong with these assets,” said Mr. Fagan, who is confident that Wall Street will come roaring back.

“Wall Street is going to reinvent itself,” he said. “The needs that were there haven’t changed.”
842 2009-01-25 “It’s not going to be inconvenient for you!”

She started laughing. “No, but seriously, if. . .”

I let her go through her litany. When she was done I reassured her: “Mom, we’re going to do whatever you want, so don’t worry. But let’s consider a few things. First, you’re worth the trouble, so that’s a ridiculous argument. Second, you’ve prepaid for the plot up here and almost everything but the dinner afterward — ”

“Oh, I put aside for that. I don’t want you kids to be out any money.”

“Plus,” I continued, “it would actually be more convenient for your children, most of whom live up here, to have friends and extended family nearby who will make up our support group. So if you’re thinking about us, burying you in Florida won’t be better.”

“And don’t you want to be buried with Daddy? And your mother and sister?”

“Well, yes, that was the one thing. . .” she trailed off.

Thanks to me, Mom was back on track for a New York burial.

But not for long. Ever since the Florida idea began percolating, she’d been determined to cross it off her list, the ultimate To Do task.

The next time the subject was reintroduced, it was presented as a done deal. I believe it started with, “Hi, dear, thanks for the lovely birthday card, so beautiful, and the Red Lobster gift certificate.”

And then — pretty quickly, I recall — she got right to the point.

“Listen dear, I wanted to tell you that I bought a plot here in Florida. I know we talked about it before and Joan’s a little upset, but Florida’s been my home for 30 years now, Dad loved it here...”

“Are you worried about people visiting your grave?” I asked.

“Oh no, when you’re dead you’re dead,” she said, casually brushing the thought aside. I could almost hear her swiping at the air with her hand in dismissal.

Her insistence about being buried in Florida probably has nothing to do with concerns for herself; there isn’t a selfish bone in her arthritic body. I believe she’s doing it for my sister Karen.

After Dad died in 2002, Mom lived alone for nearly two years. At 87 she asked Karen — who was nearing retirement age, single and didn’t own real estate — if she would move to Florida and live with her.

“What if I say no and Mom falls or breaks her hip,” Karen had said to me. “I’ll never forgive myself.”

A few months later, Karen uprooted herself from Manhattan and moved to Ocala.

They’re an odd couple. Karen’s messy, artistic and glamorous; Mom’s neat, conservative and practical. Karen likes it cold; Mom wears sweaters and socks year-round. Karen’s used to living alone; Mom’s used to having someone around.

In this role reversal of caregiver, Karen has given our mother not only more years to her life but more life to those years. And provided peace of mind for me, Joan and my brother, Joey.

When Karen moved, my mother changed her will from having all her assets split equally among us to leaving Karen the house in Florida, ensuring that she would always have a home. Soon after, she offered to buy Karen her burial plot, ensuring her an eternal home.

“She doesn’t want to discuss it,” my mother told me over the phone, sounding surprised.

“Mom, stop offering to buy Karen a grave, it’s depressing,” I remember saying. “Not everyone is as comfortable talking about death as you are.” Poor Karen was transitioning from working and living in Manhattan to being retired and living with her mother in Florida — and Mom was chatting up a grave as a selling point!

A devout Catholic, my mother seems comfortable about meeting her maker, though she’s not necessarily eager. Her mind is sharp, despite some short-term memory loss, and she’s interested in everything and everybody.

Her good health is, in part, thanks to Karen, who, a neighbor said, has probably given our mother another 5 or 10 years. My sister spends much of her time doing things my mother needs — accompanying her to doctor visits, driving her to church, running their household — as well as pushing Mom to do things she would rather avoid, like water aerobics, wonderfully therapeutic for arthritis and osteoporosis. And in between, Karen has made a life of her own. She’s grown to love the relaxed pace of Florida, made friends, joined clubs, put down roots. She doesn’t travel far, having recently lost partial vision in one eye. And I suspect this is why Mom changed her plans, to make her passing as easy on Karen as possible.

Karen didn’t try to sway our mother either way, but when she and I were discussing the topic, she said, “If Mom’s buried here, I could visit the grave.”

And then I understood my mother’s plan.

When my father died, we had a rushed memorial service in Florida — the announcement never made it into the church bulletin, and most of my parents’ friends didn’t even know Dad had passed. Three neighbors came. It was utterly depressing.

At home on Long Island, the funeral home was packed; you could barely get from one side of the room to the other. Friends, family, neighbors, colleagues came out in droves. It was heartwarming. The collage of pictures from the decades of Dad’s life sparked memories. Tales were told, stories were shared. The funeral was difficult — I remember standing in the pew between Robert and Karen, crying uncontrollably — but the wake was a joyous celebration of Joe Ganzi, the guy quick with a joke and a smile, loved by all.

Our mother’s death, whenever it occurs, will be difficult on us all, but probably hardest on Karen. If the funeral is in Florida, I won’t have friends to hug me and cousins to reminisce with about Dad’s practical jokes and Mom’s terrible cooking — all the ingredients needed to bring a person to life as you grieve for their death. But if it will ease my mother’s mind about Karen and provide a little relief for the daughter who’s been so devoted to her over the past years, that’s all the consolation I’ll need.
843 2009-01-25 With the no-sales of some big-ticket cars at the RM Auctions sale and the still unfurling economic crisis on the minds of attendees, the mood at the beginning of the Gooding auction was tense — think back to the first “Saturday Night Live” broadcast after 9/11.

The $1.4 million sale of a 1929 Duesenberg Model J Dual Cowl Phaeton, just nine lots in, had the same ice-breaking effect as when Lorne Michaels, the show’s producer, asked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani if it was all right to be funny.

David Gooding, chief executive of Gooding & Company, said there was still a strong market for good quality cars that were priced fairly and truly for sale. He did allow, however, that prices were down somewhat in the $250,000-$850,000 midrange of postwar European cars, although he sensed no similar weakness in prewar American cars in that range.

At the moment, vintage cars seem to be showing more strength in the market than other collectibles. Leigh Keno, a host of “Antiques Roadshow” on PBS, said that in general, presale estimates for American decorative arts sold at auction this season have been as much as 50 percent lower than they would have been two years ago. Mr. Keno said, “There is a sense that the market will reward more conservative estimates.”

At RM, the star car, a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport — one of just five examples of a Corvette racecar whose incredible potential was cut short by General Motors’ decision to stop supporting racing — didn’t sell during the auction. Nevertheless, RM sold a very respectable 83 percent of its lots for a total of approximately $18 million.

According to Ian Kelleher, RM’s chief operating officer, the sale attracted a record number of bidder registrations for the event, and a number of cars that could be considered “sensitive” in the marketplace sold quite well. An example of the latter was a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 Berlinetta that brought $918,500. While this was a bit less than some sales before October 2008, the price was a healthy increase over the $816,750 that RM got for a similar car at a May 2007 auction in Italy.

Given the economic circumstances, there was great interest in cars priced under $100,000 that would also serve as summer weekend drivers. Cars that are easy to find parts for, and eligible for events like vintage rallies and tours, did well.

RM, for example, sold a 1967 Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider — similar to the car driven by Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate” — for $46,200. Gooding sold a 1954 Nash Metropolitan hardtop for $19,800, Barrett-Jackson garnered an astonishing $59,400 for a 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and Russo & Steele managed $49,000 for a 1961 Triumph TR3A. All were at the least strong results, and perhaps records.

Robert Pass of St. Louis was the consigner of the 1961 Triumph. Mr. Pass has been collecting cars since the late 1950s and said he was not aware of a TR3 ever approaching $50,000 at either a public auction or in a private sale. Mr. Pass credited Russo & Steele’s arena-style format, and the enthusiasm of Drew Alcazar, the company’s owner, for pushing the car over the top.

According to Craig Jackson, chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson auction house, his company anticipated the demand for more accessible cars and purposely adjusted its offerings to favor cars in the $50,000 to $100,000 range. This was reflected in the overall sale figure of $63 million, down some $20 million from last year, but a bit higher than the company’s 2005 results of $61 million.

Mr. Jackson said that his company worked hard with consigners to ensure that there was a “meeting of the minds” where sale expectations were concerned. Nevertheless, there were notable high sales, including the second 1957 Chevrolet produced, a two-door from the entry-level 150 series with just 46,133 miles, that brought $165,000. Barrett-Jackson also continues to be the sale known for drawing new people into the hobby, with 70 percent of registered bidders being first-timers.

One of the notable aspects of the Barrett-Jackson sale was the sale of 214 cars from the General Motors Heritage Collection. Most were prototypes or concept cars and included the striking 1996 Buick Blackhawk. Built to celebrate Buick’s 100th anniversary in 2003, it recalled the granddaddy of all design studies, the striking 1938 Buick Y-Job; the Blackhawk sold for $522,500.

Nearly all the cars in the G.M. offering were sold on either a bill of sale or a scrap title, according to Barrett-Jackson. The former, Mr. Jackson said, can never be legally registered for road use. Fortunately, the Blackhawk was sold on a scrap title so it can be registered and driven on public roads. It would be a shame for it to spend its life behind a velvet rope.

Aside from the Buick Blackhawk sold by Barrett-Jackson, few concept cars were offered in Arizona. An exception was the 1954 Dodge Firearrow III sold by RM for $880,000. While some 1950s dream cars look as if they took too much styling inspiration from the Air Force’s latest interceptor, the Firearrow was exquisite in every way.

Perhaps the best buy of the G.M. collection was a 1989 Corvette ZR2, a one-of-a-kind prototype with a big-block V-8 that sold for $71,500. Tom DuPont, a Florida collector, discounted those who tried to tie the timing of the G.M. sale with the company’s dire financial condition. Mr. DuPont said he thought G.M. was simply managing its collection as many private collectors manage theirs, eliminating some cars to make for a more orderly display of the remainder.

There is certainly some common ground between the perceptions of Mr. Gooding and Mr. Jackson in the collector car market, and Mr. Keno in the antiques world. Mr. Keno said he believed that the midrange of the American decorative arts market was the softest now, as is the case with the collector car market. “However,” he said, “the great things will always do well.”

883 2009-01-26 Again this weekend, a doctrinal question exploded into a global polemic. Benedict’s decision to extend an olive branch to the four men was apparently born from a deep personal and theological desire to heal the only schism in the Roman Catholic Church in a century.

On Saturday, he said he would welcome back into the fold the four members of a sect founded in opposition to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. The bishops are members of the St. Pius X Society, which was founded in 1970 by a French archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, in opposition to Vatican II reforms. They were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated them in unsanctioned ceremonies.

The most contentious of the four is the British-born Bishop Richard Williamson, who in a recent television interview said he thought the “historical evidence” was against six million Jews dying in Nazi gas chambers.

Some saw the pope’s decision as part of a trend, or at least an indication of his priorities.

“There is obviously a theological strategy, but the repercussions on the public opinion field beyond the church are obviously only secondary in priority,” said Mordechay Lewy, the Israeli ambassador to the Vatican.

The move baffled Alberto Melloni, a professor of church history and the director of the liberal Catholic John XXIII Foundation for Religious Science in Bologna, which produced a history of Vatican II. “What is very inexplicable to me is how it’s possible to not calculate the consequences. This is abnormal,” he said.

The Society of St. Pius X does not appear to have issued any public statements on Bishop Williamson’s views on the Holocaust. But the society has never been welcoming toward other faiths.

Jewish leaders said the pope’s decision was a setback. “It’s a very serious situation,” said Riccardo di Segni, the chief rabbi of Rome. He said the tenets of Lefebvrism were as worrisome as Bishop Williamson’s personal views.

Rabbi di Segni said he did not know what the next chapter would bring. “I don’t know what kind of resolution there can be at this point,” he said.

In a public statement, the Vatican said Saturday that the revocation was a step toward full reconciliation with the Lefebvrists and that further talks would seek to resolve the “open questions.”

Other liberal critics said the pope’s decision to welcome the Lefebvrists showed that he was more willing to embrace schismatic conservatives than wayward leftists.

In his days as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Benedict censured many left-leaning prelates, including ones adhering to the Marxist-inflected Liberation Theology movement popular in Latin America.

“I would be happy if the pope would be for reconciliation, especially also for people on the progressive side,” said Hans Küng, a professor of theology at the University of Tübingen, Germany, who has for decades been Benedict’s most formidable critic on the left. A Catholic priest, Father Küng was forbidden by the church to teach theology.

The revocation seemed to move the papacy further toward intellectual concerns rather than the daily lives of Catholics. Under Benedict, the church “risks becoming a Vatican hierarchy disincarnated from faith,” said Ezio Mauro, the editor of the center-left daily La Repubblica, who writes on church-state issues.

Father Küng agreed. Benedict “does not see that he is alienating himself from the larger part of the Catholic Church and Christianity,” he said. “He doesn’t see the real world. He only sees the Vatican world.”
884 2009-01-26 By letting Internet buyers name their price for its 2007 album In Rainbows, Radiohead introduced many people to the retailing strategy called “pay what you want.” A new article in the Journal of Marketing sets out to study the mechanism.

The experimenters, Ju-Young Kim, Martin Natter and Martin Spann, persuaded three small businesses in or near Frankfurt — a buffet restaurant, a movie theater and a delicatessen — to adopt pay-what-you-want schemes. On average, customers across the three businesses (who were not always aware of the products’ regular prices) paid 86 percent of normal rates. Customers were stingiest at the movie theater, where they seemed to think the posted prices were inflated. They were most generous at the deli, where they paid 9.8 percent more for hot beverages than the going rate, a finding that seemed linked to the amount of face-to-face chatter between customers and the deli owner.

At the buffet restaurant, average payments fell, but “pay what you want” pricing drew enough new customers to more than make good on the decrease. The restaurant owner kept the scheme after the experiment ended, and the authors report that he plans to open a new “pay what you want” restaurant.ALEX MINDLIN
885 2009-01-26 Leaders of the society, which has a network of schools, churches and seminaries around the world, have distanced themselves in official statements from Bishop Williamson’s remarks, saying that they did not reflect the society’s views.

On Sunday, several congregants repudiated Bishop Williamson’s statements, which he has made in interviews, while saying that the reinstatement of four of their bishops had brought a profound, if measured, sense of relief.

Others said they felt as if they never left the Roman Catholic faith. “We don’t believe we are coming back to the church now because we were always back in the church,” said Clemente Ruiz, 54, a musician from Brooklyn.

But Joe Smetona, 23, a graduate student at Columbia who was raised going to society Masses, said Bishop Williamson’s comments were “obviously unacceptable” and “only served to sow discord.”

Regarding Benedict’s decision on the bishops, Mr. Smetona said he hoped it signaled a return to a more traditional Roman Catholic Church. “But if the whole spirit of tradition is extinguished, then I’m concerned,” he added.

The Manhattan congregation is small, with Masses attracting 40 to 50 people a week. On Sunday, most of the worshipers were middle-aged or older and most were men. The services were held in a gently worn room that the society rents at the Soldiers’, Sailors’, Marines’, Coast Guard and Airmen’s Club, a hotel for members of the armed forces on Lexington Avenue.

Priests travel to say Mass each week from Ridgefield, Conn., which is home to a church operated by the society with five priests and roughly 800 members, according to the Rev. Gerardo Zendejas, who led the Mass in Manhattan.

The Rev. Arnaud Rostand, who as the society’s leader in the United States is based at its national headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., said the society has 50,000 to 70,000 followers nationwide and 600,000 to 1 million worldwide. He said he believed the pope’s decision would boost the society’s numbers.

“We work within the Catholic Church for the restoration of the Catholic Mass and the traditional teaching of the church,” Father Rostand said.

At Sunday’s service, several worshipers said that in their view Catholicism as it was practiced before Vatican II was the true version of the faith. They also saw traditional Catholicism as an antidote to the crises that have befallen the Catholic Church, from priest sex scandals to plummeting Mass attendance.

Another congregant, Jerome Rosenbloom, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, said that he rejected what has often been described as “supermarket” Catholicism, with adherents picking and choosing whatever aspects of the faith suited them.

“We’re holding on to the traditions, passed down from the councils in the past and the teachings of the popes,” he said.

Mr. Rosenbloom also said the lifting of the excommunications would allow society adherents to feel less stigmatized: “I think people will feel a lot more comfortable.”
886 2009-01-26 Ms. Boos said that Time Life was running double the number of prime-time spots that it did a year ago. Networks try to avoid infomercial advertisers, because they pay “a fraction of what general advertising costs,” said Nancy Duitch, the chief executive of Vertical Branding, which runs infomercials for its products like the Steam Buddy and the Nicer Dicer. Although her rates vary, she said she often paid as little as 5 percent of what a general advertiser would.

Infomercials, or direct-response ads, promote a product that can be bought through a Web site or a phone number, often accompanied with blandishments like “but wait, there’s more!”

For networks, the challenge with infomercials is not their quality, but their price: infomercials qualify for much cheaper rates than regular commercials do.

In exchange for the lower prices, infomercial producers are given no guarantees about when their ads will run. The networks give priority of time to the full-price ads, which usually take up the slots during prime time and other popular times. When the networks cannot find advertisers to pay the premium time slots, they will use direct-response ads instead.

Like most direct-response advertisers, Barbara Carey, the president and founder of the Akasha Group, which sells the SpinLash and Hairagami products, says she often spends as little as $1,000 on a commercial slot.

“Usually, network television isn’t a place to go because the efficiencies are cost prohibitive for direct-response advertisers to go there,” said Richard Gagnon, the chief media officer of the advertising agency Draftfcb.

When a network shows lots of direct-response ads during popular programs, it suggests that not only are they asking lower rates, but also that regular advertisers are deciding not to advertise.

“There are some significant economic issues going on in our world that are affecting television inventory,” Mr. Gagnon said.

The money advertisers spent declined 7.5 percent on network TV, and 5.5 percent on cable, from 2007 to 2008, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a firm that tracks ad spending.

Cable is also increasingly turning to direct-response ads. The top cable news networks, despite strong ratings from the election and inauguration, have been filling prime-time ad slots with infomercials.

During the presidential election campaign four years ago, Ms. Duitch said she ran CNN spots that cost $100,000. This fall and winter, as the 2008 election unfolded, some CNN prime-time spots have cost only $9,000, she said. (CNN declined to comment, saying it did not discuss its rates.)

“The drop has just been amazing,” said Ms. Duitch, whose ads have run during peak hours on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and in local markets on ABC, CBS and NBC. Ms. Duitch said she had increased her prime-time spots by about 50 percent over last year.

A. J. Khubani, the chief executive of TeleBrands, which sells products like the PedEgg, a callus remover, and EZ Combs, a hair accessory, said that his spots used to run in the afternoon or in late-night slots. In the last few months, though, they are regularly running on CNN, CNBC, MSNBC and Fox News during prime time. Over all, Mr. Khubani said, his prime-time advertising had increased by about 20 percent over last January.

“I like to say that we’re getting beachfront property at trailer park prices,” Mr. Khubani said. “We’re clearing stuff at prime time, which we almost never do.”

Print, radio and Internet companies also filled space with these ads. For example, a full-page ad for an Amish room heater has been running in USA Today and The Wall Street Journal.

The increase in direct response has been more pronounced on television, because networks cannot easily add or lengthen programs to fill empty time slots. January tends to be a big infomercial month because advertisers concentrate on the holidays, leaving inventory available afterward.

At NBC, which has run a handful of infomercials in the last two months, “the number of direct-response spots is common for this time of year, and consistent with years past,” said Liz Fischer, an NBC spokeswoman said. At MSNBC, she said, there had been a decrease in direct-response ads, she said. CBS, which has been running some direct-response ads on Saturday nights, suggested it was because its ratings had been good.

“Our strong ratings have afforded us the opportunity to sell a variety of new inventory, rather than run make-goods,” said Shannon Jacobs, a CBS spokeswoman. “Make goods” are ads from existing advertisers that networks run when they fail to reach the ratings promised for earlier ads.

A Fox News spokeswoman, Dana Klinghoffer, said the network had set aside inventory for “make-goods,” which it did not need to fulfill, and was turning to some direct-response advertisers. Also, she said, financial, automotive and pharmaceutical advertisers had reduced their spending.

Greg D’Alba, the executive vice president of CNN ad sales, said that direct-response ads did not necessarily mean cheap ads.

“It’s true in general when it comes to other mediums, other networks, but it’s not necessarily true with CNN,” he said when asked if infomercial producers paid reduced rates.

ABC and Fox had not run any direct-response ads during their national prime time in December and January, according to representatives for the networks. Local stations, however, are allowed to sell their portions of the ad time as they like.

Ms. Carey said she was now worried that advertising time would become harder to get, as so many infomercial companies were vying for it. “It’s tightening up a bit,” she said.

Still, she said, “the as-seen-on-TV business right now is booming. It’s a very good place to be.”
887 2009-01-26 These discussions will continue in coming weeks with other Times editors and reporters.

Q. What is the prevailing view among green media journalists regarding Brazil's ethanol program and its impact on carbon emissions and the food vs. fuel issue?

Q. So since raising corn for biofuel is playing havoc with the world's food supply and apparently costing way too much, could you please bring me up-to-date about what other, more appropriate crops are under way in the U.S.A.? Are there entrenched interests impeding progress in this area?

Q. Can you make a coherent, rational case for converting corn into ethanol? To me, to be feeding our food to cars is insane. Strip away any subsidies — and the cost in fertilizer, and the resulting higher prices for everything corn-based or derived — from pork, chicken and so much else — and it looks like we are out of our minds. The only ones who seem to make out like bandits by doing so are ADM, etc.

This situation calls to mind what usually happens with "complex systems" when you meddle with them. (Jay W. Forrester — System Dynamics) — the results are anything but what is expected — anythingbut "fuel independence," etc.

On the other hand, if you don't want to make the case for it — make the case against it.

A. The corn ethanol question — and the larger debate surrounding biofuels in general — is an important one, but before I address that, I'd like to highlight an underlying assumption tucked into these andsimilar questions that are frequently aimed at those of us covering the alternative energy and environmental beats.

Can I make a "coherent, rational argument for or against corn ethanol?" Can I characterize the "prevailing view" among "green" journalists on Brazil's ethanol program and the food vs. fuel debate?

The answer, obviously, is no and no. As a journalist, it's not my place to cultivate personal views on these matters — though it's true that a lot of the media coverage of energy, the environment and climate change would lead reasonable readers to assume otherwise.

That said, the ethanol question provides an excellent object lesson in the vagaries of any potential alternative to fossil fuels — and the pitfalls of believing that any alternative is a silver bullet. Corn ethanol was celebrated just a few years ago as a simple solution to diminishing supplies of fossil fuels and, in the United States, ahomegrown means of reducing dependence on foreign energy supplies.

The certainty of that solution was quickly muddied, however, when food prices began to rise, and closer analyses began to question whether the energy invested or the carbon released in production of corn ethanol eclipsed whatever benefits are derived from its cleaner combustion. In Brazil, sugar cane is the main feedstock, and much ink has been devoted to concerns that demand for ethanol there is accelerating the destruction of forests, as agriculture expands apace.

No study of corn ethanol production — or of biofuels generally — has produced conclusive evidence that the assertions on either side of the debate are entirely correct. Rather, the questions themselves highlight the complexity of the climate change/energy challenge, and the need, in my mind, for careful consideration of all the implications attending any one approach.

Of course, we are not likely to discover an energy source for which there is no attending environmental cost. The key is to consider the entire life cycle of each new idea, and decide as a nation — or a planet — what sorts of costs we're willing to bear.

One footnote: Cellulosic ethanol — that is, ethanol derived from organic scrap material like corn stalks, rice straw and other non-edible parts of plants, or from other materials like wood chips and switchgrass — has been touted as a potential alternative to crop-based ethanol. But even here, some scientists advise caution, as Iwrote for Green Inc. last fall.

"A cellulosic biofuels industry could have many positive social and environmental attributes," the authors of the policy note appearing in Science magazine last October wrote (PDF), "but it could also suffer from many of the sustainability issues thathobble grain-based biofuels, if not implemented the right way."

Q. Now that our "green president" has begun his drive to clean up auto emissions, we will have another restraint on the ability of U.S. manufacturers to compete in a global industry. How can this possibly help?

A. Another great question — and one that's on the minds of many American consumers in the wake of President Barack Obama's request today that the Environmental Protection Agency reconsider California's quest to enforce tougher emissions standards. Several states are already lined up to follow California's lead, and it will almost certainly complicate things for automakers — though some would argue that's not necessarily a bad thing.

One of our chief contributors to Green Inc., Kate Galbraith, has been chatting with representatives of the auto industry, so I tossed this question to her. Here's her response:

Q. How many applications for nuclear plants are there in the United States, where are the plants to be located, and which ones do you think might come on line first? Thanks for your good work.

Q. In Citrus County, Florida, where I live, Progress Energy operates a nuclear power plant. To my knowledge, Progress Energy has maintained the plant safely, been a good corporate citizen, and amajor source of higher paid jobs. Progress Energy now proposes to build a new nuclear power plant in neighboring Levy County. The conservative local newspaper and local business interests have lined up in support of the nuclear power plant in the interest of job creation. Environmentals oppose the plant because it will degrade the environment in the short run and in the long run leave the problem of nuclear waste. They also oppose the plant because it doubles the risk to the community of a terrorist attack. Finally, they oppose the plant because it uses resources on nuclear power that could otherwise be invested in greener forms of energy, particularly solar power. Any thoughts on what questions we should be asking in order to decide whether the new nuclear power plant is good or bad for our community and for the country?

A. For the first question, I consulted my friend and colleague — and The Times's resident nuclear power expert — Matt Wald.

Matt reports that, as of today, there are 17 applications to build 26 nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Matt adds, anticipates 6 more applications to build an additional 9 plants — though he points out that proposals for power plants, in general, have "a high mortality rate."

That is to say, most of them never get built.

"A term that originated in the computer industry for products that are announced but never marketed — "vaporware" — seems applicable," Matt said. "Whether any get built depends heavily on the price of natural gas and the price anticipated for carbon dioxide, and the success of efforts to improve energy efficiency. Proposals in Florida, Texas and the northeast probably have the best chance."

As for the second question, well, this is a wildly divisive topic, and you capture the debate extremely well.

Those who favor nuclear power argue — often rather persuasively — that it is a comparatively clean energy source (at least on the generation end of things); that it is capable of producing very large amounts of energy from a relatively small amount of fuel; that once a plant is built, operating costs are competitive with fossil fuels; and, perhaps most pointedly in these days of handwringing over galloping greenhouse gases, that the technology and its attending climate benefits are available now.

Opponents of nuclear power counter — equally persuasively — that nuclear waste is highly toxic and remains so for thousands of years; that the capital costs for building a plant are enormous; that uranium procurement has a history of being somewhat of a messy affair (though so, too, is coal mining); that nuclear plants typically require lots of water — another precious resource; and the costs of a mishap, both environmentally and in terms of human health, are comparatively high.

There's also the terrorism question — although just how likely it is that terrorists would take aim at Levy County, Fla., would probably be a matter of debate.

Of course, the questions that are most likely to animate your local debate will be just that: local. Where is the plant being located and what will the environmental impact of construction be? How will it make use of local water resources? What sorts of jobs are likely to be created, and are they worth the investment and the necessary tradeoffs? Are any of the viable alternatives capable of meeting regional energy needs any time soon? What sort of stock do you put, as a community, in the ability of Progress Energy to operate the plant and handle waste safely?

Stepping back, I suppose there's also a certain investment of faith in mankind's ability to develop heretofore undiscovered ways of recycling nuclear waste, generating less of it, or finding new and better ways of storing it until it's no longer a threat. For some that's an easy investment. For others, not so much.

You also ask if nuclear power plants are good for the country. I'd venture that the answer to that question will arise — as it has for some time now — from the collective response to individual projects in communities like yours.

Harnessing the Power of the Sea

Q. What is underway to capture the natural energy of our coastal seas?

A. I'd like to answer this question by citing a couple of articles from The New York Times:

As you might guess from the diction, the article is an old one — published Sept. 11, 1921. (A PDF of the article is available from The Times's archives.)

Now let's fast forward 87 years and consult The Times again:

That tidbit comes from an article written last fall by my colleague, Kate Galbraith — on Sept. 22, 2008.

The multidecade narrative is, I think, one of immense ambitions that have gone unrealized.

My sense of where things currently stand with ocean wave and tidal power? I'd say that while it remains an alluring potential power source, the technological hurdles — which are expensive hurdles — are still being worked out, and we are quite some distance away from anything that will produce power at scale.

As Kate said in her story, "Roughly 100 small companies around the world are working on converting the sea's power to electricity. Many operate in Europe, where governments have pumped money into the industry. Companies and governments alike are betting that over time, costs will come down. Right now, however, little electricity is being generated from the ocean except at scattered test sites around the world."

What About Natural Gas for Cars?

Q. Why hasn't there been more push from the federal government to natural gas for vehicles? Perhaps it's not a long-term answer but surely it's better than petroleum in the short term. It would save on the balance of payments to foreign countries, reduce greenhouse gases, and an infrastructure would be easy to achieve. We can still go to other energy sources when they become available.

A. It takes a village to answer some of these questions. This time, I tapped the combined brain trust of Kate Galbraith and Matt Wald, who noted that although natural gas vehicles have been around for some time, Mr. Belden is right to note that they've never really taken off in large numbers. At the moment, the only natural-gas car manufactured and sold by a major automaker in the United States is a version of the Honda Civic.

For a hefty fee, other vehicles can be converted to run on natural gas.

But there are several barriers to entry for natural gas cars. From Matt and Kate:

Q. Is anybody seriously following through with the next question in electric car technology? Namely, where is the power going to come from to charge up the cars, besides the obvious answer of the garage outlet. In other words, will we end up putting more exhaust in the atmosphere from coal-fired power plants because of electric cars than we would with oil products?

A. I asked Justin Gillis, The Times's energy editor in Business Day, for advice on this one. Justin noted that while electric cars will almost certainly mean increased combustion of coal at power plants, it's likely that an electrified fleet would still represent on overall gain for the climate — and a pretty big one.

For further reading on the topic, it might be worth taking a look at a study completed in 2007, and jointly authored by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Electric Power Research Institute. Allowing for the myriad variables to which Justin alludes above, the study, which can be found here, comes to a similar conclusion: In almost any conceivable scenario, mass conversion to electric vehicles is likely to provide "significant" reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Q. What are your thoughts on whether in the near future we will be paying a more equalized price for organic foods and products — or even less ... than the alternatives that add things like hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, other chemicals and the cost that goes into genetic engineering etc.?

A. The best mind I can think of for this question is that belonging to our reporter covering the food industry, Andrew Martin. Take it away, Andy:

Q. You recently addressed a number of questions regarding "Ethanol for Fuel," and in your answers you suggested that one must carefully examine both sides of any alternative fuel. I would like to broaden the scope of the debate to include solar energy. I see many benefits but no real potential problems associated with this type of energy production. Could you comment on this?

A. I suppose that many of the upsides and downsides associated with any alternative energy source depend on where you sit. Sure, solar power has few of the emissions issues associated with fossil fuels, but that doesn't mean there aren't problems to be overcome.

Perhaps the most obvious of these is that the sun only shines during the day — when it's not too cloudy — and storing the energy harvested is difficult. Technology companies are busy trying to overcome these issues, but as with wind power, the intermittency of solar energy and its storage are significant impediments, at least for now.

Getting down to the community level, there are also those pernicious Nimby issues (that is, Not In My Back Yard) that dog nearly every energy technology. In the case of solar, you might also call them Nimbbl issues — as in, Not In My Big, Beautiful Landscape.

Bringing solar power to scale will almost certainly require fairly huge installations. And while the United States hasplenty of open spaces that would provide ideal conditions for large-scale solar, not everyone wants to see those natural landscapes altered for energy production.

Another issue is that many of the best places to harvest solar power on a large scale are, as with wind power, far from where the energy is most needed. That requires new modes of transmission, which inevitably stirs up land and landscape disputes, because transmission lines are going to have to go somewhere.

Finally, while solar power generation is undeniably clean, the manufacture and disposal of solar panels — which include some toxic components — is beginning to trouble some advocates. Just this month, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, published a report on this problem. (A PDF of the report is available here.)

Compared with other energy sources, many people may find these wrinkles to be relatively minor — and we should never underestimate the ingenuity of the human animal to overcome these and other problems.

The point, though, is that every energy solution will require some sort of social and environmental tradeoff. And every fledgling alternative is going to need vast amounts of investment and government nurturing to get off the ground in any way that might make a difference any time soon.

So is solar the best place to pour resources? Wind? Geothermal? Ocean power? And what about retrofitting existing fossil fuel plants with new technologies so they produce fewer greenhouse emissions? Is that worth it? Do we spread the money around or focus it in one place?

These are all tough decisions.

The trick will be identifying — and agreeing on — which methods provide the most benefit with the least cost to both people and the planet.

How Tech Savvy Must a Green Reporter Be?

Q. Some of your answers have indicated that development of alternative energy will depend on a combination of technology and societal choices. To what extent do journalists in this area have (or need) anunderstanding of the technologies versus quoting various proponents or opponents? And to what extent should stories differentiate between engineering, economic and public acceptance challenges?

A. At its root, you're asking a question that applies to journalists working on any beat. That is to say, how much expertise ought a journalist have in the subject area he or she is covering?

My initial inclination is to say the more the better. But as you might guess, that's not always practical, and when you get down to the particulars, it's not always desirable. Having a trained doctor cover the health beat, for example, would certainly have its advantages, but not every M.D. has the additional skill sets required of a working journalist.

These certainly include an ability to quickly gather and distill complex information from a variety of sources into a form that's clear and accessible to a lay reader — or viewer, or listener, in the case of television and radio; an ability to recognize the national or global implications of small changes and trends within a discipline; and because no one knows everything, a native desire to dig, question, and seek out a variety of voices, vignettes and expertise as a way of capturing, in a relatively small amount of space, the fullest and most honest representation of developments on a beat.

That may sound like a highfalutin' job description for a journalist, but it's what good ones aspire to.

We certainly have journalists at The New York Times with advanced training in medicine, economics, physics, biology and other disciplines — and we're lucky to have them. But the paper is also full of talented, omnivorous generalists who have covered a number of beats in their careers — from politics to science to the war in Iraq. There are far too many of these to even begin naming.

The energy and environment beats are no different. We have some reporters deployed on these topics who have years of experience and a deep understanding of the complexities underlying the science, the engineering, and the politics of climate change, the fossil fuel industry and renewable energy. We have others who are new to the subject, but whose inherent curiosity and knack for reporting are uncovering facets of the beat that more experienced journalists might overlook. The combination, I think, works well.

As for how much focus any one story ought to have on the engineering, economic and social aspects of the beat, well, they all come into play. Some stories may touch on all three. Others will drill down on one area. But they're all vital to the ongoing coverage of the energy and environmental challenges ahead of us.

A Comment on the Comment of the Moment

Q. Love Green Inc. Hate the Comment of the Moment. It is out of step with the thoughtful content I expect from you. I'm forced to listen to the deniers on conservative talk radio at work, and am veryfamiliar with short and snappy total fabrications being sold as truth. Lately all of the comments seem to be cherry-picked slams at the environmental movement and those of us who believe that together we can move this country forward. Is Rush responsible for picking which comments appear and are read by every visitor to Green Inc.?

A. Thanks for the feedback, Mitch, and for reading us so closely.

As anyone running one of The Times's blogs can tell you, critical interpretation of the "Comment of the Moment" — or the COM, as we like to call it — is among our readers' favorite pastimes. But speaking for Green Inc., the exegesis will always prove unrevealing, and I can promise you that Rush Limbaugh has exercised no influence over our selections.

Indeed, we've received complaints from others that we too often reflect the "green" agenda in the COM, and fail to give voice to, for instance, those among our audience who insist that global warming is an elaborate hoax — like Pat, or Mike, or Betty.

The truth is, when we remember to swap out the COM at all (we should do it more often than we do), we typically hunt for short, succinct, clever and sometimes humorous observations that won't take up too much space in the righthand column. There's no ideological litmus test involved.

If you're noticing the selections skewing one way or another at any point, I'd encourage you to just keep reading. The balance will show itself in the long view.

Q. I applaud the interest in and movement toward alternative energy but I worry that we are ignoring a big elephant in the room. Shouldn't we direct some attention towards population? Is someone trying to figure out how how much larger the human population can grow before it is no longer sustainable? Are governments talking about this?

A. This is a fascinating question -- and one with broad social and political implications. It's also one over which economists, anthropologists and other social scientists have puzzled at least since the time of Thomas Malthus, who famously held that human population growth had the potential to hugely outstrip food production.

Not everyone, of course, has embraced the Malthusian world view, which included the idea that family size among the poorer classes ought to be limited, though in modern China, social engineering of a less selective kind -- that is, family size limits for all citizens -- has been at work for some time.

In any case, it's a complicated issue, so I reached out to James Kanter, a correspondent in Brussels for The International Herald Tribune and one of our chief contributors at Green Inc.

Here's what James had to say:
888 2009-01-26 Oil lost 70 percent of its value in recent months as the global economy fizzled and oil consumption fell. In the United States, the world’s biggest consumer, demand has dropped nearly 8 percent, or 1.6 million barrels a day, from a year ago. Most experts believe global oil consumption will decline in 2009 for the second straight year.

But OPEC’s policy seems to be catching up with the economic downturn. After hitting a peak above $145 a barrel in July, and falling to $32 a barrel by December, their lowest level since the end of 2003, oil prices have stabilized in recent weeks. As the latest OPEC cuts have influenced the markets, prices have been trading in a range from $35 to $45 a barrel.

OPEC’s success has created the prospect of a rebound in prices — most oil-producing countries want prices well above $70 a barrel. But such a rebound could hobble the world economy further, making an eventual recovery more difficult.

Already, retail gasoline in the United States has bottomed out and begun to rise. It is still far below the high of $4.11 a gallon in July, but is up about 20 cents over the last month, to a national average of $1.86 a gallon.

On Friday, oil prices rose $2.80 a barrel, or 6.41 percent, to settle at $46.47. While that is well below last summer’s level, it remains relatively high by historical standards.

The precipitous slide in recent months had alarmed many producers, as well as some Western oil companies, which warned of lower investments for new energy supplies.

ConocoPhillips, for example, last week trimmed its investment program by 18 percent, or $2.8 billion, for this year. Suncor Energy, which produces oil from Canadian tar sands, slashed its investments for the second time in a few months. After posting a loss in the fourth quarter, Suncor cut its spending plans to $3 billion this year, down from $10 billion.

“Politically, it is better to say we need the lowest possible oil prices, but there are economic implications to low prices, and not just for OPEC producers,” said Olivier Jakob, the managing director of Petromatrix, an independent research firm in Zug, Switzerland. “Lower prices defer investments in the energy sector that could hurt Western economies in the longer term.”

The steep drop means that oil prices have returned to levels last seen before 2004. But given a rise in production costs, and vast government spending programs initiated by most oil-producing states, many oil exporters today need significantly higher prices to balance their budgets.

Saudi Arabia, for example, once seen as favoring low prices, recently said that it considered $75 a barrel to be a fair price.

Oil companies also say they need higher prices to develop complex and costly resources, like deepwater fields or tar sands, that have higher break-even costs.

“If economies recover, we will quickly face the same challenges on the supplies,” Helge Lund, the chief executive of StatoilHydro, a Norwegian oil company, said in a recent interview. “We won’t be able to meet the increase in demand.”

The drop in prices, if sustained, may lead to a realignment of policies even for the most nationalistic producers, analysts said. Kazakhstan and Venezuela, for example, recently indicated they might relax investment terms or seek new deals with foreign companies in a bid to bolster their production and increase revenues.

The OPEC cartel’s discipline reflects a more forceful stance taken by Saudi Arabia, the group’s most powerful producer, which has taken the lead in aggressively cutting production in recent weeks.

The country’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said the kingdom would go even beyond its OPEC pledges with a unilateral cut that would bring its output next month below its official target. Analysts expect the kingdom to reduce its output by an additional 300,000 barrels a day below its OPEC quota.

“We are working hard to bring the market in balance,” Mr. Naimi said a few days ago in New Delhi.

Saudi Arabia’s economy is expected to shrink this year, and the country is planning to run a budget deficit because of the slump in oil prices.

OPEC has received some involuntary help from other producers. These include Mexico, where output from the country’s biggest oil field is declining sharply; Russia; and Canada, where producers of tar sands have shut down some operations that are becoming uneconomical at today’s lower oil prices.

The last time the cartel met, in December, its members pledged to reduce production by 2.2 million barrels a day. It was the group’s third agreement in four months to cut its output, after pledges of 500,000 barrels a day in September and 1.5 million barrels a day in October.

But not everyone believes that OPEC’s actions can keep prices from falling further, especially if the global economy continues to worsen.

OPEC has announced 12 quota reductions since 1993, and 80 percent of the time the cartel succeeded in defending a floor for oil prices, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. The times when the cartel failed was when global economic growth was falling sharply, as in 1998 and 2001.

OPEC’s president, José Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, has said he expected oil prices to eventually recover to around $75 a barrel this year as a result of OPEC’s actions. The cartel is expected to meet again in March. At least one producer, Iran, has said the group might slash production even further to push up prices.

“If all the cuts are carried out within the established time frame, there will be an impact in the market that will lead to a positive trend in terms of oil prices,” Mr. de Vasconcelos told Reuters.
889 2009-01-26 “A lot of people in the business are concerned with how much money they are losing, but not with how much money they could make,” Mr. Berry said.

Under his proposal, the money collected by the Internet providers would be sent to a special agency that would distribute the proceeds to the copyright owners, including the record labels and music publishers. They would receive payments based on how often their music was downloaded or streamed over the Internet, as they now do in many countries when it is performed live or on the radio.

The Isle of Man did not invent this idea. The concept of a so-called blanket license to distribute music digitally has been discussed since the days when Napster, before its rebirth as a legal service, thumbed its nose at the music industry.

There are precedents for such systems in Europe, where many countries have mandatory license fees for television owners to finance public broadcasting. Several European countries also impose taxes on blank CDs as well as audiovisual and computer equipment; the money typically goes to support cultural industries.

In 2006, a French proposal similar to the one being discussed on the Isle of Man made it to Parliament, but it was rejected after fierce lobbying from copyright owners. The government later threw its weight behind a new approach: requiring Internet service providers to disconnect persistent pirates.

That plan is still wending its way through the legislature, but it has drawn interest elsewhere, including in Britain. (While the Isle of Man shares a head of state with the United Kingdom — the queen — it has its own parliament and makes its own laws.) There, policy makers are dangling the threat of a system like France’s plan to disconnect pirates, to try to get Internet providers and the music companies to agree on ways to stimulate the development of legitimate digital music sales and to curb piracy.

While the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major labels in the United States, has backed away from a nearly six-year campaign of litigation against individual file-sharers, the music companies’ continuing effort to battle piracy in other ways dismays some analysts.

“They spend 90 percent of their time trying to keep me from doing what I want to do and 10 percent of their time trying to make it possible,” said Gerd Leonhard, author of “The Future of Music.”

Actually, the major music companies — Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and EMI — have grown considerably more flexible in recent months, making their music available in ways they might once have considered unthinkable.

New services offering “free” music, bundled into the cost of a broadband subscription or financed by advertising, are proliferating. “On the drawing board, these are very virtuous models, but it’s all about getting the right implementation,” said Michael Nash, executive vice president for digital strategy and business development at Warner Music. “You don’t want to completely displace all your existing consumers and end up with a lower-value model.”

Representatives for Sony and Universal declined to comment on the Isle of Man proposal. A spokesman for EMI could not be reached.

Rather than adopting one-size-fits-all licensing terms, the recording companies say their preferred approach is to work with individual partners to increase digital revenue, which accounted for about 20 percent of the industry’s sales last year, according to the industry’s global trade group, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

John Kennedy, chief executive of the federation, called plans like that of the Isle of Man effectively a “state-imposed tax that would be unworkable in practice and discriminate against consumers who want Internet access without music services.”

The island, perhaps best known as a tax haven — the government prefers “tax-efficient jurisdiction” — has taken an interest in digital music and other high-technology businesses as it seeks to diversify its economy beyond financial services.

In 2001, it was the first place in the world to start third-generation cellphone services, known as 3G. Broadband is available in every home, and more than 70 percent of households are connected.

Mr. Berry, the director of inward investment, said he had begun talks with music companies to try to gain support for his plan.

“Our size, demographics and history of innovation means that the island could be an ideal test bed,” he said.
890 2009-01-26 Pfizer earned $268 million, or 4 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $2.72 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue dropped 4 percent, to $12.35 billion. Excluding the $2.3 billion to settle the marketing inquiry, Pfizer had a profit of 65 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by had forecast 59 cents.

“The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will meaningfully deliver Pfizer’s strategic priorities in a single transaction,” the Pfizer’s chief executive, , said in a statement Monday. “Our combined company will be one of the most diversified in the industry and will benefit from complementary patient-centric units that match speed with the benefits of a global company’s scale and resources.”

The merger almost came unhinged at the 11th hour. While the boards of both companies agreed to the broad outlines of the deal and its price before the weekend, these people said, one issue was still a sticking point: whether Pfizer would be allowed to back out of the deal if the economy worsened or Wyeth’s prospects faded.

In better times, deals often falter on matters of strategy or price. But in this case, because of the ailing economy, Pfizer has agreed to pay a staggering breakup fee, $4.5 billion, if it does not complete the deal under certain circumstances — if, for example, its credit rating drops and it can no longer finance the deal. That is almost twice the typical breakup fee for a deal of this size.

If the acquisition is completed, it may demonstrate that Wall Street is willing to lend again, at least to the nation’s top companies with the best credit ratings.

“If banks need to send a message that they’re loaning, they want to be loaning to this quality of company,” said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at .

Pfizer’s bid is being financed by four banks that received federal bailout money: , , and , the people involved in the deal said. Such banks have been criticized for not doing more lending since they received the government aid.

, which acquired out of bankruptcy in the fall, is also providing financing, these people said.

Pfizer appears to be taking advantage of the bad market for credit to buy Wyeth at a lower price than it might fetch if competing bids were to emerge, which analysts do not expect.

“They have a unique opportunity now because not everybody can get that capital,” said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at .

Because the combined company is expected to generate more than $20 billion in cash a year, Ms. Ryan said, “even when they borrow money, they will still have plenty of revenue.”

Under the terms of the deal, Pfizer would pay $50.19 a share for the company — $33 a share in cash and 0.985 Pfizer shares worth $17.19 a share based on Pfizer’s closing price on Friday. That is roughly a 29 percent premium over the share price before word of the deal leaked on Friday.

Both companies’ boards of directors approved the deal.

Wyeth’s management team would depart, the people involved in the negotiations said. Pfizer is also planning to cut its quarterly dividend in half to 16 cents, these people said, in an effort to maintain its credit rating.

After news reports disclosed the talks on Friday, investors applauded the possibility of a deal. Shares of Wyeth rose $4.91, or 12.6 percent, to close at $43.74. Pfizer climbed 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $17.45.

Pfizer expects to save $4 billion annually by combining with Wyeth; those savings will be phased in over three years.

Mr. Kindler of Pfizer, first approached Wyeth last spring with a phone call, people involved in the talks said. The negotiations heated up in the summer but appeared to collapse when the banking system went into a tailspin in September and October.

Since then, there were several brief moments when it appeared the deal would move ahead, but then the talks would fall apart once again, usually over financing, these people said. It was apparently only within the last week or so that the financing commitment came together.

For Mr. Kindler, a lawyer who came to Pfizer from , the deal may be a job-saver. His and the company’s most pressing challenge has been the impending expiration of patent rights to the -lowering drug — which accounted for a quarter of the company’s 2007 revenue of $48 billion and remains the best-selling drug in the world. The patent ends in 2011.

Still, even with the Wyeth deal, much would remain undone for Pfizer as it faces product, patent and pipeline problems for other drugs as well.

“It’s not just Lipitor,” Ms. Arnold wrote last year in a report to investors. Pfizer faces a run of 14 patent expirations through 2014, which would add up to lost revenue of about $35 billion as those drugs give way to cheap generics, according to Ms. Arnold. Pfizer’s patent problem is not unique among the big drug makers. , and are all facing their own patent losses in the next five years. “Everybody’s staring at the same challenges down the road,” Ms. Ryan said.

She said that Mr. Kindler, who became chief executive in July 2006, had probably not been in a position to make a play for a company like Wyeth until after he had cut costs, revamped Pfizer’s core business and accepted the reality that the research pipeline was not producing blockbusters. “Hope springs eternal from the research pipeline,” Ms. Ryan said.

As part of the deal with Wyeth, both companies will have to repatriate tens of billions of dollars back into the , which could have a high cost. Pfizer reported $25.3 billion in revenue, 52.2 percent of its total, from overseas operations in 2007, according to securities filings.

If foreign profits were repatriated to the United States, Pfizer would have to pay the difference between the tax paid in the foreign country, as low as 5 percent in , for example, and the 35 percent tax rate in the United States.

Ms. Arnold said some tax penalties might be expected, but could be reduced by doing some of the buying and selling overseas.

“The experts that we’ve spoken to have very definitely said you can use offshore cash to buy offshore assets, and Pfizer and Wyeth both have very significant offshore subsidiaries that they place cash in,” Ms. Arnold said. For example, she said, “Pfizer Ireland can use its cash to buy Wyeth Ireland or Wyeth .”

Wyeth, with sales of about $23 billion for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, has about $2.7 billion in cash and liquid assets, according to David S. Moskowitz, an analyst at Caris & Company, an bank.

Pfizer was advised by Goldman, JPMorgan and Barclays; Wyeth was advised by and .

Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the who follows biomedical industries, said Pfizer and Wyeth were a great fit that made the deal creditworthy.

First, because Pfizer has so much cash, the deal does not have to be highly leveraged with debt, Mr. Gordon said. Second, the two companies have enough overlap that they can achieve considerable saving through consolidating duplicate operations and cutting costs. And finally, parts of a combined operation could be spun off to raise money.

Mr. Gordon pointed to the animal health businesses of both companies — which, considered together, accounted for $2.8 billion in revenue and about $600 million in profit in the first nine months of 2008.

“They could sell that business for billions of dollars to either pay down the debt or service the debt,” he said. In addition, he said Pfizer could resell Wyeth’s consumer products business. He added: “This deal is the rare thing. This’ll be the only money investment bankers make in a while.”
891 2009-01-26 “I am worried,” said Mrs. Diop, a 57-year-old trader and farmer. “I can double my money. Or I can lose everything.”

African farmers and consumers have often been stuck with the sharp end of globalization, and when food prices soared in 2008, poor African nations with liberalized economies suffered enormously.

In countries like Senegal, which, with a population of 13 million, consumes about 600,000 tons of rice a year, cheap imports of staples like rice and wheat from farms in Asia that are vastly more efficient, and often government-subsidized, typically flood local markets. The imports drive out more expensive locally produced rice.

So when prices rose last year and many countries stopped or curtailed exports amid global panic over food supplies, this country had virtually no local supply to replace it.

As the crisis spread, riots over high prices broke out in poor nations across the globe. In Haiti, the anger was so deep that the prime minister was forced to resign. In Senegal, angry demonstrators thronged the streets, demanding to know what the government would do to bring down prices.

President Abdoulaye Wade quickly announced plans to increase agricultural production, offering subsidized seed, fertilizer and equipment, on the theory that self-sufficiency was a matter of national security.

But the crisis also presented an opportunity to millions of farmers across Africa: high prices could finally make their crops competitive.

In Senegal, farmers eyed the long-neglected Senegal River valley, which snakes along the country’s northern border with Mauritania. A government project in the 1970s built irrigation canals that made more than 600,000 acres of land ready to produce rice, but farmers were too poor to afford the materials to farm the land on a large scale. The project was largely abandoned.

Nevertheless, the dream of creating a rice basket here never really died. The area has the potential to satisfy not just the local markets but those of neighboring countries as well, along with providing jobs for the vast army of unemployed young people with few prospects beyond the dream of migrating to Europe.

Rice is the staple of the Senegalese diet — the national dish, thieboudienne, consists of fish and broken rice grains cooked in a thick and spicy tomato sauce.

But the price of producing rice locally made it more expensive than imports, and as a result, Senegalese farmers produce on average only about 80,000 tons of rice a year, and often struggle to sell that much, according to farming experts here.

“It simply didn’t pay to grow rice,” said Arona Diakhate, technical director of a rice processing factory here. “Why grow something you can’t sell? It doesn’t make any sense.”

When the global food crisis drove prices up, the equation changed.

Ibrahima Ly, secretary general of Pinord, a local organization supported by the British charity Oxfam to help farmers get access to credit and markets for their crops, says that only 70,000 acres of rice is being farmed. Well over 500,000 acres could be planted in this region, he says, producing more than enough to feed the entire nation and beyond.

“We have a sweet-water river; we have heat, which rice likes; we have people who need jobs and know how to grow rice,” he said. “Nature has given these things, but you need to manage it, and you need to make sure there is a market for this rice.”

It is a great thing that local growers are finally expanding production, he said, but their investments are incredibly fragile.

“We don’t have any control of the market,” he said. “There is huge volatility, and that makes it very difficult to protect their investments.”

If farmers lose a lot of money this year, they are unlikely to risk planting again, Mr. Ly said, which could prove catastrophic.

In a report released in November, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations warned that low prices this season could create an even worse replay of last year’s crisis by discouraging planters from producing.

“If prices were to remain depressed in 2008-9 and plantings for next year are affected,” the report said, “a similar, if not more pronounced, price surge may be witnessed in 2009-10, unleashing even more severe food crises than those experienced in the current season.”

That wild card is the gamble for growers like Mame Bassine Gaye. A trader who had been dabbling in rice farming, she has struggled to turn a profit. The first year she tried planting rice, her yields were meager and the prices low. This year, however, she went all out, borrowing more than $1,000 from a local credit cooperative and family members to expand her production.

Mrs. Gaye surveyed her 250 acres in the village of Ronkh as the year drew to a close and the harvest was about to begin. It had been a good season across much of West Africa, and she expected a bumper crop.

“If I win, I will win big,” she said. “But if I lose, I’ll lose big. I am worried because of my debts. If you don’t pay, they cut you off. I could lose everything.”
892 2009-01-26 A normally confident , chief executive of , expressed this very fear last week after announcing the company’s first big reduction of its work force. “Our model is not for a quick rebound,” he said. “Our model is things go down, and then they reset. The economy shrinks.”

This has happened before. The dot-com bust earlier in the decade dragged down high-fliers like and but set the stage for a new generation of Web powerhouses like and other innovative Internet software companies like Salesforce.com, founded on disrupting the status quo.

The recession of the early 1990s sent , then the dominant force in technology, into a five-year tailspin. But it also propelled Microsoft and Compaq, later acquired by , and to the forefront of computing.

Indeed, Silicon Valley may be one of the few places where businesses are still aware of the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who wrote about business cycles during the first half of the last century. He said the lifeblood of capitalism was “creative destruction.” Companies rising and falling would unleash innovation and in the end make the economy stronger.

Recessions “can cause people to think more about the effective use of their assets,” said , the retiring chairman of , who has seen 10 such downturns in his long career. “In the good times, you can get a bit careless or not focused as much on efficiency. In bad times, you’re forced to see if there is a technology” that will help.

So who’s up, who’s down and who’s out this time around? Microsoft’s valuable Windows franchise appears vulnerable after two decades of dominance. Revenue for the company’s Windows operating system fell for the first time in history in the last quarter of 2008. The popularity of Linux, a free operating system installed on many netbooks instead of Windows, forced Microsoft to lower the prices on its operating system to compete.

Intel’s high-power processors are also under assault: revenue tumbled by 23 percent last quarter, marking the steepest decline since 1985.

Meanwhile, more experimental but lower-cost technologies like netbooks, Internet-based software services (called cloud computing) and virtualization, which lets companies run more software on each physical server, are on the rise.

Penny-pinching shoppers like Mr. Title could have the most immediate effect on the tech industry, particularly if more people consider canceling their cable subscriptions to watch video online, or drop their landline telephones to depend on their cellphones or on Internet calling services like Skype.

Many consumers appear ready to abandon the costly desktop computer altogether. Analysts expect PC sales to fall in 2009 for just the second time in the last two decades, with desktops falling even faster than they did in 2007 or 2008.

The only bright spot in the PC industry is netbooks. Analysts at the Gartner research company said shipments rose to 4.4 million devices in the third quarter of 2008, from 500,000 units in the first quarter of last year. Analysts say sales could double this year despite a deep worldwide recession.

Two lumbering giants, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, missed the first wave of these tiny, stripped-down machines, allowing Acer of to grab market share. Acer pushed out of the No. 3 spot behind H.P. and Dell as sales soared 55 percent. Dell and H.P. are making the devices now.

Even the mighty Apple, whose and revenue had helped insulate it from the first phase of this recession, reported last week that revenue from its desktop line fell 31 percent from the same period a year ago.

“The day of the laptop and the high-end computer may not be totally over,” said , an independent technology industry analyst in Hayward. Calif. “But certainly the audience for that type of product is getting smaller and smaller.”

Companies have also started to examine what they can do without and what they can do differently, and their choices may alter the competitive and lucrative landscape of business computing.

Hoping to save money, Arista Networks, a start-up based in Menlo Park, Calif., has much of its internal technology processes online, or “in the cloud.” Instead of buying its own hardware and software systems from the likes of Microsoft and , it opted for e-mail and online document services from Google and online sales and manufacturing software from Netsuite, based in San Mateo, Calif.

It is spending a fifth of what it would be for traditional technology, said Jayshree Ullal, Arista’s chief executive.

She smells a trend. “I think 80 percent of the new high-tech and small to mid-size companies are doing what we’re doing,” she said.

A spate of start-ups have seized on cloud computing. Companies like Intacct offer online accounting software as an inexpensive alternative to Microsoft’s products, and giants like sell access to data centers for business operations. has outpaced the traditional hardware makers with such services.

The number of virtualized new servers has doubled over the last three years, which has driven the revenue of , one of the leaders in this cost-saving technology, to an estimated $1.88 billion last year from $387 million in 2005.

The makers of open-source software also continue to benefit from the growing appeal of their often cheap, if not free, products. Sun Microsystems distributes 65,000 downloads a day of its MySQL database, which has turned into the favored business software of new companies. The job search engine shows a thriving job market for MySQL and Linux developers.

Linux has proved popular as well on a new crop of smarter devices — be they phones, TVs or set-top boxes — that have captured software developers’ imaginations. The new products they build will undoubtedly challenge the status quo.

“Companies like Intel, and that make chips for these devices are hiring Linux talent as quick as they can,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the nonprofit Linux Foundation. “They know the future is netbooks and mobile Internet devices.”
893 2009-01-26 Classic ad campaigns of the “Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz” variety are an endangered species. Nowadays television is exploring “branded entertainment,” which allows sponsors to insinuate their products into the story line in order to thwart viewers who DVR past ads.

NBC’s “30 Rock” devoted one episode to mercilessly mocking product placement even as it placed its sponsors’ products in the script. “Trust Me” is heavily branded entertainment — the plots are integrally woven into promotions that include Apple computers, Starbucks coffee and Chris-Craft speedboats — that prefers to maintain that everything in advertising is still pretty much as it was.

The pilot opens with an inside joke, a woman lying by a swimming pool shadowed by a passing airplane, a reference to a 1979 “Share the Fantasy” campaign for Chanel No. 5. Mason and Conner are lounging by the same hotel pool, in Los Angeles for a 10-day photo shoot that is clearly a boondoggle.

“Some kids want to be firemen, some kids want to be astronauts,” Conner says. “We always wanted to be hung over on expensive booze that someone else is paying for while everyone back in Chicago thinks we are working.”

Actually, most ad executives in the Midwest these days are thinking about unemployment: in November, the Detroit area office of the advertising agency BBDO, which had Chrysler as its major customer, laid off 22 percent of its work force.

There are a few attempts to signal that the advertising business is changing. Younger copywriters in the company complain that tag lines are “old school,” only to be rebuked by Mason, who recites a litany of famous tag lines, including “We Try Harder” and “Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.”

Mason and Conner are longtime friends and colleagues who complement each other, except when they clash. Mason is steady, hardworking, married and the father of three, whereas Conner is single, irresponsible and childish. The casting is counterintuitive: comedy duets usually play up physical differences, but in this case both actors are tall, lean and dark haired.

But together the two plausibly balance rapid-fire repartee with more soulful moments. Mr. Cavanagh, who was mawkishly cute in the role of a small-town lawyer on “Ed,” here is more bearable as a charmingly glib, but mostly annoying, sidekick.

Their chemistry is enhanced, and sometimes eclipsed, by Monica Potter’s star turn as Sarah Krajicek-Hunter, a talented, deeply neurotic and irritating copywriter. “Hi, Stu,” Sarah says, chasing her new and distracted boss across the room. “I know it’s only my first day, and I am really excited to be working with you, and I can’t wait, really, but the thing is, and it’s totally no big deal, but I thought I was getting a window office.”

Ms. Potter, who is very, very funny but also touching, is one of the best things in the show.

And advertising, even in these constrained times, is an engaging premise. Besides police work and ice dancing, there are not many other jobs that rely on a buddy system, and that conceit fueled “Bosom Buddies” and “Thirtysomething.” It’s a creative profession that unlike medicine or the law can never really take itself seriously.

Insecurity is its comic leitmotif — even in flush times, admen like Darren on “Bewitched” are at the mercy of tyrannical bosses and mercurial clients — and the best advertising executives act as if they are just one pitch away from disgrace and unemployment.

These are not flush times however. A little like the self-contradictory tag line “Instant Classic,” this series is infused with nowadays nostalgia, a trip back not to yesteryear but yestermonth.

894 2009-01-26 But on Sunday, Senator John McCain of Arizona said that he would oppose the package as it now stands.

“The plan was written by the Democratic majority in the House, primarily, and so, yeah, I think there has to be major rewrite,” Mr. McCain said on “Fox News Sunday.” Asked if that meant he would oppose it, he replied: “I am opposed to most of the provisions in the bill; as it stands now, I would not support it.”

Still, Mr. McCain, the recent Republican presidential candidate, said that he wanted to work with Mr. Obama and still believed that a compromise package could pass in February.

While saying that “clearly we need to have serious negotiations,” he added, “I think we can sit down in three weeks and work hard and negotiate and come to some agreement, hopefully.”

Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader, was also critical of the package, which he said relied too much on government spending — and on spending that would produce results far too slowly, some for projects deemed dubious. As it stands, he said, “We don’t believe it’s going to work,” adding that “a lot of Republicans will vote no.” But Mr. Boehner held open a door to compromise, saying, “At the end of the day, we want him to succeed, because America needs him to succeed.”

Mr. Obama himself presented the argument for his plan on Saturday, in his first weekly video address as president, saying it would help students go to college, protect workers from losing health care, lower energy bills and modernize schools, roads and utilities.

“This is not just a short-term program to boost employment,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education, health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.”

The administration’s plan to press the lobbying effort included the appearance Sunday by Vice President Biden on CBS and by Mr. Obama’s chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, on NBC.

Mr. Obama, who played host to Congressional leaders from both parties on Friday and met with his economic team on Saturday, will visit Capitol Hill in the coming week to talk with Republican lawmakers on their home turf. But House Republicans are stiffening their resistance to the magnitude of spending in the plan developed by House Democrats on Mr. Obama’s behalf to create or save more than three million jobs.

About two-thirds of the $825 billion is reserved for spending and the rest for tax breaks. In the Republican response to the president’s address Mr. Boehner called for deeper tax cuts instead. He is pushing a Republican plan to lower federal income tax rates in the two lowest brackets rather than provide a $500 per worker tax credit, as Mr. Obama wants to do. The Republican plan would also give tax breaks to small businesses, home buyers and the unemployed.
895 2009-01-26 Again this weekend, a doctrinal question exploded into a global polemic. Benedict’s decision to extend an olive branch to the four men was apparently born from a deep personal and theological desire to heal the only schism in the Roman Catholic Church in a century.

On Saturday, he said he would welcome back into the fold the four members of a sect founded in opposition to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. The bishops are members of the St. Pius X Society, which was founded in 1970 by a French archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, in opposition to Vatican II reforms. They were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated them in unsanctioned ceremonies.

The most contentious of the four is the British-born Bishop Richard Williamson, who in a recent television interview said he thought the “historical evidence” was against six million Jews dying in Nazi gas chambers.

Some saw the pope’s decision as part of a trend, or at least an indication of his priorities.

“There is obviously a theological strategy, but the repercussions on the public opinion field beyond the church are obviously only secondary in priority,” said Mordechay Lewy, the Israeli ambassador to the Vatican.

The move baffled Alberto Melloni, a professor of church history and the director of the liberal Catholic John XXIII Foundation for Religious Science in Bologna, which produced a history of Vatican II. “What is very inexplicable to me is how it’s possible to not calculate the consequences. This is abnormal,” he said.

The Society of St. Pius X does not appear to have issued any public statements on Bishop Williamson’s views on the Holocaust. But the society has never been welcoming toward other faiths.

Jewish leaders said the pope’s decision was a setback. “It’s a very serious situation,” said Riccardo di Segni, the chief rabbi of Rome. He said the tenets of Lefebvrism were as worrisome as Bishop Williamson’s personal views.

Rabbi di Segni said he did not know what the next chapter would bring. “I don’t know what kind of resolution there can be at this point,” he said.

In a public statement, the Vatican said Saturday that the revocation was a step toward full reconciliation with the Lefebvrists and that further talks would seek to resolve the “open questions.”

Other liberal critics said the pope’s decision to welcome the Lefebvrists showed that he was more willing to embrace schismatic conservatives than wayward leftists.

In his days as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Benedict censured many left-leaning prelates, including ones adhering to the Marxist-inflected Liberation Theology movement popular in Latin America.

“I would be happy if the pope would be for reconciliation, especially also for people on the progressive side,” said Hans Küng, a professor of theology at the University of Tübingen, Germany, who has for decades been Benedict’s most formidable critic on the left. A Catholic priest, Father Küng was forbidden by the church to teach theology.

The revocation seemed to move the papacy further toward intellectual concerns rather than the daily lives of Catholics. Under Benedict, the church “risks becoming a Vatican hierarchy disincarnated from faith,” said Ezio Mauro, the editor of the center-left daily La Repubblica, who writes on church-state issues.

Father Küng agreed. Benedict “does not see that he is alienating himself from the larger part of the Catholic Church and Christianity,” he said. “He doesn’t see the real world. He only sees the Vatican world.”
896 2009-01-26 But on Sunday, Senator John McCain of Arizona said that he would oppose the package as it now stands.

“The plan was written by the Democratic majority in the House, primarily, and so, yeah, I think there has to be major rewrite,” Mr. McCain said on “Fox News Sunday.” Asked if that meant he would oppose it, he replied: “I am opposed to most of the provisions in the bill; as it stands now, I would not support it.”

919 2009-01-27 Suppliers of home heating oil from Maine to Maryland have agreed to gradually reduce sulfur levels in their oil over the next 10 years in an effort to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, a contributor to haze.

The agreement was made with the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union, a planning organization that coordinates efforts to improve air quality to meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The suppliers will reduce sulfur in heating oil to 0.0015 percent from 0.2 percent. Brandon Wright of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America said that consumers should see a small increase in the price of oil as a result of the change, but that it would be offset by savings from more efficient furnace and boiler operation in their homes.

The change will begin going into effect in next year’s heating season, he said.

In a statement, Anna Garcia, executive director of the planning organization, said the change would provide “important public health and environmental benefits.”

Bob Boltz, chairman of the National Oilheat Research Alliance, said removing the sulfur would greatly reduce the maintenance requirements of oil heat equipment.
920 2009-01-27 But Amgen and Biogen are big enough to fend for themselves. More precarious is the condition of many smaller biotechnology companies, those without revenue-producing products and profits. With capital markets frozen, many of these companies are running out of cash and looking to sell themselves or their products to a larger company.

“There are probably 5,000 biotech companies out there that are waiting for a deal to save them,” said Oleg Nodelman, portfolio manager at the Biotechnology Value Fund, which invests in smaller biotechnology companies. Pfizer executives say they remain interested in alliances and deals. “We are going to continue to look at opportunities for innovative drugs and technology,” Corey S. Goodman, the president of Pfizer’s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center in South San Francisco, Calif., said Monday.

But others say the debt that Pfizer took on to buy Wyeth might preclude it in the short run from buying any but the smallest of biotech companies. And when two big companies merge, talks for deals with smaller companies tend to get put on the back burner, as management’s attention is diverted and the newly combined company assesses its research pipeline.

“It will just drag people’s attention away, and they will want to do only the critical things,” said Jonathan MacQuitty, a partner at venture capital firm Abingworth. With small, unprofitable private biotech companies unable to go public, venture capitalists’ hope for a payout are typically based on selling the companies they start to pharmaceutical companies.

Matt Geller of Geller Biopharm, a boutique investment bank, says that because Wyeth is so science-oriented, it has been seen as a good potential partner for smaller and middle-size biotechnology companies. “Unfortunately,” he said, “it does take a potential buyer of smaller biotech companies off the market.”

Pfizer, on the other hand, had a reputation for paying top dollar for products or for smaller companies. It raised many eyebrows last September, for instance, when it agreed to pay $225 million initially, and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars later, for the rights to an Alzheimer’s disease drug being developed by Medivation, a San Francisco company.

Pfizer is behind many of the other large pharmaceutical companies in moving into biologic drugs, which are made in living cells and are more immune to generic competition. But it is trying to make strides.

In late 2007 it hired Mr. Goodman, an academic neuroscientist and biotechnology entrepreneur, to lead its move in that direction, in part by arranging alliances with smaller companies and with universities. To keep the operation nimble, Mr. Goodman reports directly to Mr. Kindler, the chief executive, and has a fair degree of autonomy.

Some experts say Pfizer’s purchase of Wyeth might actually spur other pharmaceutical companies to buy biotechnology companies. One reason Pfizer was interested in Wyeth was the latter’s expertise in manufacturing biotech drugs and vaccines.

“I think it’s just further evidence of how valuable these assets are,” said Kris Jenner, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund. “There are plenty of buyers outside of Pfizer who are interested in biotech assets.”

Moreover, Pfizer’s ability to arrange $22.5 billion in debt financing from five banks for the Wyeth acquisition raises the chances that Roche will be able to raise the money it needs to acquire the 44 percent of Genentech that it does not already own.

Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical giant, first proposed to pay $43.7 billion for those shares in July, an offer Genentech rebuffed as too low. Analysts expect Roche to raise its bid, but its difficulty in arranging financing has slowed negotiations.

Big pharmaceutical companies are not the only ones who can buy companies or drugs. In some cases, mid-size biotech companies like Cephalon and Myriad Genetics are outracing larger companies to snap up some drugs.

That is why Mr. Nodelman, at the Biotechnology Value Fund, said he did not expect the Pfizer-Wyeth deal to have much of a braking effect on acquisitions of small companies or their drugs. “All it means is there is one less company that might do a deal with them,” he said.
921 2009-01-27 His counterpart, Bernard J. Poussot, 56, the Wyeth chairman, who appeared beside Mr. Kindler, also termed it a “perfect” fit. But it will be Mr. Kindler’s job to make it work. He will be chairman of the merged companies, which will be known as Pfizer, while Mr. Poussot is expected to depart if the merger is completed as planned this year.

If the Pfizer-Wyeth deal had gone into effect last year, Mr. Poussot would have been entitled to about $38 million in cash severance, pension, health benefits and other perquisites. But because of changes the Wyeth board put in place on Jan. 1, the total value of the golden parachute is worth less than half that amount — an estimated $18.3 million.

In many ways, Mr. Kindler, the Harvard-trained lawyer who has led Pfizer since July 2006, had spent the last two years preparing for a big deal. He has already cut $2.8 billion in costs and 15,000 jobs. He has turned research away from the cardiovascular medicines that helped make Pfizer a giant but whose fading glory is embodied in the $13 billion-a-year cholesterol drug, Lipitor, which will lose its United States patent in 2011.

Now, if the deal is completed, Pfizer, which had sales of $48 billion in 2007, is looking forward to absorbing Wyeth, which is based in Morristown, N.J.

As many big mainline pharmaceuticals companies face their own patent problems and the prospect of cheap generic competitors to their best-selling drugs, the Wyeth deal will help Pfizer smooth a potential patent “cliff” into a mere bump in the road, says Barbara Ryan, a Deutsche Bank analyst. A predicted 30 percent drop in revenue in four years will be only 10 percent at worst, she said.

“This just has to happen in this industry,” Ms. Ryan said in an interview. “As a scale player, Pfizer can generate dramatically more earnings out of Wyeth than Wyeth can alone.”

Two Pfizer chairmen before Mr. Kindler have made major acquisitions with grand ambitions, only to see them falter. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $90 billion in 2000 mainly to gain control of Lipitor, and it bought Pharmacia for $60 billion in 2003 to get the painkiller Celebrex. But Lipitor spawned no successor drug, and Celebrex sales plummeted after a similar drug, Vioxx, made by Merck, was linked to strokes and heart attacks.

Mr. Kindler said the Wyeth purchase was different. “We have obviously learned a lot from our prior acquisitions,” he said, conceding they had “hurt morale and hurt productivity.”

To make the Wyeth deal work, Mr. Kindler promised to cut $4 billion in combined spending by 2012 and to slash 15 percent of the companies’ combined work force. But he said he would do so “thoughtfully and being very careful to protect the core asset that makes both of these companies successful.”

Pfizer also said Monday that it would cut its dividend in half, to 16 cents a share, partly to shore up credit ratings, as the company borrows $22.5 billion to help finance the deal from five banks — four of which recently received federal bailout money.

“It’s good to see banks doing what banks are supposed to be doing,” Mr. Kindler said. “I think it is really good for America to support a competitive, strong, healthy, biopharmaceutical industry.”

David Moskowitz, an analyst with Caris & Company, praised the deal for its biotechnology drugs and vaccines from Wyeth and the cost-cutting potential of combined operations. In a note to investors Monday, he predicted an “exciting” year for pharma mergers and acquisitions, with Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers Squibb being the most likely takeover targets.

Timothy D. Anderson, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said he expected cost-cutting to be closer to $6 billion. “The next big pharma merger is likely to see a level of cost-cutting not seen before,” he wrote Monday to investors.

Certainly, Wyeth and Pfizer employees were bracing themselves for deep cuts.

Magid Abou-Gharbia, director of the Center for Drug Discovery Research at Temple University, who recently left Wyeth after 26 years as a scientist and manager, said he has been receiving calls from anxious Wyeth scientists.

“I’m trying to be a calming factor,” Mr. Abou-Gharbia said in a telephone interview Monday. “Remind them that I went through three mergers at Wyeth, and after each one, the organization emerged stronger.”

As investors digested Pfizer’s news, the stock fell 10.3 percent to $15.65 a share Monday. Wyeth held steady, down 0.8 percent to $43.39 after rising 12.6 percent Friday on the takeover rumor.

Mr. Kindler defended the dividend cut, saying the Wyeth purchase gave “clarity” to future earnings.

Pfizer also reported its fourth-quarter financial results, showing that revenue dropped 4 percent, to $12.35 billion, as it lost United States exclusivity for the allergy drug Zyrtec and the colon-cancer drug Comptosar.

Excluding special charges, Pfizer said it would have earned 65 cents a share, up from 50 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. But Pfizer’s earnings dropped by more than 90 percent, to $266 million, or 4 cents a share, after one-time charges — the biggest being the $2.3 billion set aside to settle the Justice Department’s Bextra case.

The government had accused Pfizer of paying off doctors and making false and misleading claims about the drug to encourage its unsafe use for acute and surgical pain. The investigation has also expanded to the marketing and safety of other Pfizer drugs. A spokeswoman for Michael Sullivan, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, who is leading the investigation, did not return phone calls.

Bextra was withdrawn by Pfizer in 2005. The company settled Bextra complaints from 33 states for $60 million last October and agreed to pay $894 million to settle suits over Bextra

On any other day, the Bextra settlement might have been big news for Pfizer — which is why some analysts said the company had probably decided to disclose it on Monday.
922 2009-01-27 After helping to fuel the horrific war in eastern Congo, Rwanda has created a potential opening for ending the conflict by arresting Gen. Laurent Nkunda, the rebel leader who once seemed untouchable. It is a surprising and positive move. But it is only a start.

Now the international community must keep the pressure on the Rwandan and the Congolese governments to take other steps that could eventually stabilize this traumatized region. That includes continuing to withhold aid to Rwanda and insisting that United Nations peacekeepers be allowed to operate in eastern Congo to discourage fighting and bear witness to atrocities on all sides.

Mr. Nkunda, whose troops have been accused of massacres as far back as 2002, was arrested on Thursday. It was a stunning turnabout since he had long been supported by Rwanda, which twice invaded Congo in pursuit of Hutu rebels who fled there after taking part in the 1994 genocide. We hope his arrest means an end to the proxy war between Rwanda and Congo.

It would be chilling if an even more brutal leader, Jean Bosco Ntaganda — who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes — succeeds him as leader of the rebel forces. (At some point, Mr. Nkunda must be brought to justice. The court is believed to be considering the case against him.) Some experts fear the two countries have struck a deal that would allow Rwandan commandos free rein to go after Hutu militants in eastern Congo. That is extremely risky.

A political settlement is the only hope for a durable peace. African leaders, the United Nations, the United States and China (a major new regional investor) must exert more pressure on all parties — starting with the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, and the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame — to implement such an accord.

Over the past decade, as many as five million Congolese have died and one million have been displaced because of the fighting. It is past time for the suffering to end.
923 2009-01-27 Rooney goes to Mass every morning, then commutes to the Steelers’ training facility on the South Side. He drives a Buick. In the office by 8:15, he checks in with the coaches, the players and his son Art II, the oldest of his nine children and the team’s president. He watches practice. He eats lunch in the cafeteria with the players and the staff.

“Some owners treat you like a rental property,” said defensive end Nick Eason, who has played in Denver and in Cleveland. “They have some maintenance guy to take care of it, they just come by to check on it, they look and they leave. Mr. Rooney comes around, he always sticks his hand out to you. ‘Hey, Nick’— and I’m like, he knows my name?”

Nose tackle Casey Hampton said: “A lot of owners, this is a hobby, but for him, this is his business, what he does. He’s here, shakes your hand, talks to you every day. Every day.”

With defensive end Aaron Smith, Rooney talks about flying. With Batch, a Pittsburgh native, the subject is high school football. “With me, it’s usually my hair,” the platinum-blond kicker Jeff Reed said. Rooney asks about their wives, their girlfriends, their children. He asks about punter Mitch Berger’s dad, who grew up a Steelers fan and came to opening day. Strong safety Troy Polamalu said he treats all the players as his equal, “from Hines Ward to a free-agent rookie.” Some players have his cellphone number. One day a couple of years ago, cornerback Ike Taylor was exhausted and, at Rooney’s invitation, took a two-hour nap on the couch in his office while Rooney worked elsewhere.

Ward, a receiver, said it was Rooney’s example that taught him the importance of a handshake. “I never used to shake hands. It was always just, ‘Hi, how ya doing?’ But something about him made me realize it’s all in the handshake, and every time I meet somebody now, I shake their hand.”

The night before home games, Dan and his wife turn out for the team dinners at a local hotel.

“Every team says it’s a family, but it’s bull a lot of the time,” Berger said. In a 13-year career in which he has worn 10 uniforms, he said there had been times when he played mostly for himself. His five months with the Steelers have been different. “I’m glad I got a chance to experience the way it should be before everything’s said and done.”

The Steelers family encompasses not only the current team but past players as well. “You come back, and you’re still a part of here,” Ward said. “We know the history of the team. Not only do we represent ourselves but all the players who wore the black and gold before us.”

The former linebacker Andy Russell, who played for the Steelers for 13 years, said: “Here I’ve been out of the game over 30 years, and they jump up and come over and shake my hand and tell me how pleased they are to see me. You know, I’m thrilled to see them. It’s a brotherhood.”

As is his way, Dan Rooney, takes none of the credit. Sitting behind a football-shaped desk overlooking the practice field here last week, he steered the conversation away from himself.

“It started with my father,” he said. “He gave me the values. He treated players, coaches, general staff as people. He was concerned about them.”

That culture now permeates the entire organization — a sort of ego-free zone in which players and coaches can occasionally seem as if they’re competing for a Nobel prize in humility. “We don’t care who gets the credit, and all we want to do is win,” Coach Mike Tomlin said.

Rooney has consistently looked not just for skilled ballplayers but for athletes who would hold themselves accountable to each other and the community. “Those are the kind of people he assembles here, and it makes it a fun place to work,” Tomlin said.

The result has been stability and continuity. Now in his second season, Tomlin is the Steelers’ third head coach in 40 years — testimony to the Rooneys’ loyalty, patience and understanding of what it takes to build a winning team.

There are years when the assorted personalities coalesce and years when they don’t. “It’s very important that a team come together, that they develop respect for each other — you can call it love,” Rooney said. “We went to Miami to play the Dolphins one season, and there was a hurricane. The lights went out in the hotel, and all of our players came out of their rooms and sat in the hall, where there was emergency lighting. Believe it or not, that helped to bring these guys together.”

The contracts the Rooneys offer are not always top dollar compared with other teams, and players looking for a big paycheck sometimes go elsewhere. The Steelers lost Alan Faneca to the Jets, Joey Porter to the Miami Dolphins. Dan majored in accounting at Duquesne University. As a negotiator, he has a reputation for being both tough and fair.

Ward held out in 2005 and was summoned to a meeting with Dan Rooney at the start of training camp. “I hated to do it,” Ward said, “but as a player, you come to a point in your career where you have to stand up for what you think is right. The business took precedence over the relationship. There were no hard feelings between us. He said, ‘Look, we want you to be a Steeler, we’re going to commit to you and try to get this thing to work right.’ And just hearing that made me change my mind. I’m still here, and I’ve got a chance to retire as a Steeler.”

Hard bargains aside, the money seems never to have been the goal where the Rooneys are concerned. Dan has no apparent interest in luxury items. His cluelessness when it comes to clothes is a running joke, within his family and among the team. Art II said, “One of my brothers will see a picture of him and give me a call and say, ‘Make sure he doesn’t wear that suit again.’ ” Casey Hampton has offered to take him shopping.

He has no second home — no country house, no Florida beachfront condominium. His sole extravagance is flying: he pilots his own plane to training camp and league meetings. Apart from an annual trip to Ireland, he rarely travels. When he does, it’s not often to destinations catering to members of his income bracket. In 2003, with the help of experts from the Senator John Heinz History Center, Rooney and members of his extended family retraced Lewis and Clark’s expedition, which began in Pittsburgh 200 years earlier and ended at the Pacific coast in Oregon.

A confirmed workaholic, Rooney shows no signs of slowing down.

“Some nights, we have to kick him out of the office,” Art II said. Their working relationship is modeled on the one Dan had with his father, and the dynastic succession is unfolding at the same gradual pace. “My grandfather never really retired, and I don’t expect my father to ever really retire,” Art II said. “This was their life, and that’s a blessing.”

Art II now oversees the Steelers’ day-to-day operations. Dan continues to manage the Steelers’ role in the league.

“I sit next to him at league meetings,” said John Mara, a Giants co-owner. “Dan is usually fairly quiet — he takes everything in. Then he’ll get up and walk towards the microphone, and the whole room goes silent, because we all want to hear what he has to say. For a while now, he has been the conscience of the league, somebody who always speaks with the league’s best interest at heart.”

Mara and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell cite Rooney as a mentor. During recent negotiations to restructure the Steelers’ ownership to comply with league policy, the prospect that the team might pass out of the Rooneys’ hands arose for the first time. In the end, Dan’s brothers agreed to sell shares, allowing him and Art II to remain in control, a resolution greeted with relief throughout the league.

“There is great admiration and respect for Dan Rooney, but it was also a question of respect for the principles of our system,” Goodell said. “Family ownership and involvement have been critical components of the league’s success.”

Rooney has taken a leadership role through many of the most important issues that the league has faced, from the collective bargaining agreement that ended the strike in 1982 to the search for a new commissioner in 2006. But the most conspicuous and far-reaching of his contributions is the rule that bears his name, adopted in 2003, requiring that at least one minority candidate be interviewed for coaching positions.

According to Paul Tagliabue, then the commissioner, the idea for a mandatory interview policy came from the league’s lawyers, who knew that it had proved effective in business. Tagliabue thought it would be better if the initiative came from the owners. He asked Rooney to take the lead. Mara said: “He was probably the only person in the room who could have gotten that passed. He obviously practices what he preaches.”

Rooney says that the rule has already had an effect, although there is still considerable progress to be made. When people cite Tomlin’s hiring as an example of the changes that the Rooney Rule can bring, Rooney is proud to set them straight: the Steelers had already interviewed Ron Rivera, then the Chicago Bears’ defensive coordinator; technically, the interview with Tomlin was not required.

Bill Nunn, who began scouting black colleges for the Steelers in 1969, once said that Rooney “doesn’t see color” — a quality Rooney attributes to his father and his old neighborhood. “In those days growing up on the North Side, we didn’t think about your skin color or your accent or what church you went to,” he wrote in his memoir, “Dan Rooney: My 75 Years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL.” “What mattered was that you lived up to your word, pulled your own weight and looked out for your friends.”

Although the Rooneys are not the wealthiest family in Pittsburgh, many in town consider them the most powerful. When Dan Rooney, a lifelong Republican, endorsed Barack Obama for president last spring, it gave Obama a needed boost in western Pennsylvania. Even though his endorsement infuriated a vocal contingent of Steelers fans, Rooney continued working for the campaign, accompanying Obama to meet with steelworkers.

Two days after the Steelers won the American Football Conference championship, on Jan. 18, Rooney attended the inauguration. He and other idealists were having a good week.

There was a time, back in the ’60s, when Pittsburgh followed other teams’ lead and hired its own squad of cheerleaders, the Steelerettes — but Rooney did away with them when they proved to be “an unnecessary distraction” from the game itself. Steelers fans, he reasoned, like their football straight, without exotic dancing girls shaking pompoms on the sideline.

Rooney continues to put his faith in football. With the industry that was the team’s namesake gone and half the city’s population scattered, the Steelers inspire a devotion that goes beyond the game, a nostalgia for old-fashioned Pittsburgh virtues: hard work, self-reliance, discretion, humility. Rooney has infused his team with the code of honor he lives by.
924 2009-01-27 Cocaine is undoubtedly bad for the fetus. But experts say its effects are less severe than those of alcohol and are comparable to those of tobacco — two legal substances that are used much more often by pregnant women, despite health warnings.

Surveys by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2006 and 2007 found that 5.2 percent of pregnant women reported using any illicit drug, compared with 11.6 percent for alcohol and 16.4 percent for tobacco.

“The argument is not that it’s O.K. to use cocaine in pregnancy, any more than it’s O.K. to smoke cigarettes in pregnancy,” said Dr. Deborah A. Frank, a pediatrician at Boston University. “Neither drug is good for anybody.”

But cocaine use in pregnancy has been treated as a moral issue rather than a health problem, Dr. Frank said. Pregnant women who use illegal drugs commonly lose custody of their children, and during the 1990s many were prosecuted and jailed.

Cocaine slows fetal growth, and exposed infants tend to be born smaller than unexposed ones, with smaller heads. But as these children grow, brain and body size catch up.

At a scientific conference in November, Dr. Lester presented an analysis of a pool of studies of 14 groups of cocaine-exposed children — 4,419 in all, ranging in age from 4 to 13. The analysis failed to show a statistically significant effect on I.Q. or language development. In the largest of the studies, I.Q. scores of exposed children averaged about 4 points lower at age 7 than those of unexposed children.

In tests that measure specific brain functions, there is evidence that cocaine-exposed children are more likely than others to have difficulty with tasks that require visual attention and “executive function” — the brain’s ability to set priorities and pay selective attention, enabling the child to focus on the task at hand.

Cocaine exposure may also increase the frequency of defiant behavior and poor conduct, according to Dr. Lester’s analysis. There is also some evidence that boys may be more vulnerable than girls to behavior problems.

But experts say these findings are quite subtle and hard to generalize. “Just because it is statistically significant doesn’t mean that it is a huge public health impact,” said Dr. Harolyn M. Belcher, a neurodevelopmental pediatrician who is director of research at the Kennedy Krieger Institute’s Family Center in Baltimore.

And Michael Lewis, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., said that in a doctor’s office or a classroom, “you cannot tell” which children were exposed to cocaine before birth.

He added that factors like poor parenting, poverty and stresses like exposure to violence were far more likely to damage a child’s intellectual and emotional development — and by the same token, growing up in a stable household, with parents who do not abuse alcohol or drugs, can do much to ease any harmful effects of prenatal drug exposure.

Possession of crack cocaine, the form of the drug that was widely sold in inner-city, predominantly black neighborhoods, has long been punished with tougher sentences than possession of powdered cocaine, although both forms are identically metabolized by the body and have the same pharmacological effects.

Dr. Frank, the pediatrician in Boston, says cocaine-exposed children are often teased or stigmatized if others are aware of their exposure. If they develop physical symptoms or behavioral problems, doctors or teachers are sometimes too quick to blame the drug exposure and miss the real cause, like illness or abuse.

“Society’s expectations of the children,” she said, “and reaction to the mothers are completely guided not by the toxicity, but by the social meaning” of the drug.

Research on the health effects of illegal drugs, especially on unborn children, is politically loaded. Researchers studying children exposed to cocaine say they struggle to interpret their findings for the public without exaggerating their significance — or minimizing it, either.

Dr. Lester, the leader of the Maternal Lifestyle Study, noted that the evidence for behavioral problems strengthened as the children in his study and others approached adolescence. Researchers in the study are collecting data on 14-year-olds, he said, adding: “Absolutely, we need to continue to follow these kids. For the M.L.S., the main thing we’re interested in is whether or not prenatal cocaine exposure predisposes you to early-onset drug use in adolescence” or other mental health problems.

Researchers have long theorized that prenatal exposure to a drug may make it more likely that the child will go on to use it. But so far, such a link has been scientifically reported only in the case of tobacco exposure.

Teasing out the effects of cocaine exposure is complicated by the fact that like Yvette H., almost all of the women in the studies who used cocaine while pregnant were also using other substances.

Moreover, most of the children in the studies are poor, and many have other risk factors known to affect cognitive development and behavior — inadequate health care, substandard schools, unstable family situations and exposure to high levels of lead. Dr. Lester said his group’s study was large enough to take such factors into account.

Ms. H., who agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that her last name and her children’s first names not be used, said she entered a drug and alcohol treatment program about six years ago, after losing custody of her children.

Another daughter, born after Ms. H. recovered from drug and alcohol abuse, is thriving now at 3. Her oldest, a 17-year-old boy, is the only one with developmental problems: he is autistic. But Ms. H. said she did not use cocaine, alcohol or other substances while pregnant with him.

After 15 months without using drugs or alcohol, Ms. H. regained custody and moved into Dayspring House, a residential program in Baltimore for women recovering from drug abuse, and their children.

There she received psychological counseling, parenting classes, job training and coaching on how to manage her finances. Her youngest attended Head Start, the older children went to local schools and were assigned household chores, and the family learned how to talk about their problems.

Now Ms. H. works at a local grocery, has paid off her debts, has her own house and is actively involved in her children’s schooling and health care. She said regaining her children’s trust took a long time. “It’s something you have to constantly keep working on,” she said.

Dr. Belcher, who is president of Dayspring’s board of directors, said such programs offered evidence-based interventions for the children of drug abusers that can help minimize the chances of harm from past exposure to cocaine or other drugs.

“I think we can say this is an at-risk group,” Dr. Belcher said. “But they have great potential to do well if we can mobilize resources around the family.”
925 2009-01-27 “Ten percent may not seem like a high number,” Dr. Solomon said Monday in a telephone news conference, “but it is the kind of number that has been seen in major droughts in the past, like the Dust Bowl.”

At 600 p.p.m., there might be perhaps 15 percent less rain, she said.

In 1850, atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 280 p.p.m., a level scientists say had not been exceeded in at least the previous 800,000 years.

In their paper, Dr. Solomon and her colleagues say they confined their estimates to known data and effects. For example, they based their sea level estimates largely on the expansion of seawater as it warms, a relatively straightforward calculation, rather than including the contributions of glacial runoff or melting inland ice sheets — more difficult to predict but potentially far greater contributors to sea level rise.

The new work dealt only with the effects of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for about half of greenhouse warming. Gases like chlorofluorocarbons and methane, along with soot and other pollutants, contribute to the rest. These substances are far less persistent in the atmosphere; if these emissions drop, their effects will decline relatively fast.

Michael Oppenheimer, a geoscientist at Princeton, praised the report in an e-mail message as a “remarkably clear and direct” discussion of whether it would be possible to temporarily exceed a level like 450 p.p.m. and then reduce emissions in time to avoid catastrophic events like the collapse of a major inland ice sheet.

Dr. Oppenheimer said the new analysis showed that “some dangerous consequences could be triggered and persist for a long, long time, even if emissions were cut radically.”

“Policy makers need to understand,” he continued, “that in some ways once we are over the cliff, there’s nothing to stop the fall.”

Dr. Solomon said it would be wrong to view the report as evidence that it was already too late to do much good by reducing carbon emissions. “You have to think of this stuff as being more like nuclear waste than acid rain,” she said.

Acid rain began to abate when pollution contributing to it was limited. But just as nuclear waste remains radioactive for a long time, the effects of carbon dioxide persist.

“So if we slow it down,” she said, “we have more time to find solutions.”

For example, engineers may one day discover ways to remove the gas from the atmosphere. But “those solutions are not now in hand,” Dr. Solomon said. “They are quite speculative.”
926 2009-01-27 The way four-legged animals walk has been well known since the 1880s, when Eadweard Muybridge’s motion-capture photographs revealed the sequence of leg movements. They walk this way: the left hind leg moves forward, followed by the left foreleg, right hind leg and right foreleg, in order.

You’d think that since this knowledge has been around for a century or so, artists, taxidermists, toy designers and others responsible for depicting animals would get it right. But a study by Gabor Horvath of Eotvos University in Hungary and colleagues shows that this is often not the case.

After analyzing more than 300 depictions of walking animals in museums, veterinary books and toy models, the researchers report that in almost half of them the leg positions are wrong. The findings are published in the journal Current Biology.

The researchers studied only depictions where it could be determined unambiguously that the animal was walking, and not trotting or otherwise running, as in those gaits the leg movements may differ. (In walking, two or more legs are touching the ground at all times while in galloping, for example, there are moments when all the legs are lifted.)

The researchers found, for example, that a skeleton of a dog at a Finnish museum depicts the right hindleg in a rearward position while the right foreleg is lifted and moving forward. In a proper depiction the hindleg would be forward too, having moved before the foreleg.

The researchers say that while toy designers may perhaps be forgiven, it is surprising that artists and others who provide depictions for natural history museums and textbooks are so scientifically incorrect.
927 2009-01-27 We agree that the United States Civil Rights Commission should be transformed into a United States Commission on Civil and Human Rights.

In addition to addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, a commission could address the pressing issues Americans are facing during this devastating economic downturn, like inequalities in access to housing, education, jobs and health care.

Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of human rights at home. A broad coalition of civil rights and social justice leaders is urging the Obama administration to reaffirm the United States’ longstanding bipartisan commitment to human rights at home and abroad.

Indeed, as Barack Obama said on Human Rights Day, human rights “has allowed us to work to perfect our union at home while standing as a beacon of hope to the world.”

The moment is ripe to build human rights into the foundation of our government and restore America’s standing in the world.

The writers are the co-coordinators of the Campaign for a New Domestic Human Rights Agenda. Mr. Baraka and Ms. Kaufman are executive directors of, respectively, the United States Human Rights Network and the Human Rights Institute at Columbia Law School; Ms. Powell is an associate professor of law at Fordham Law School.
928 2009-01-27 In an awards season almost as thrilling as winning the 20-million-rupee prize on an Indian game show, the cast of “Slumdog Millionaire” received the Screen Actors Guild’s award for outstanding performance by a motion picture cast at a ceremony on Sunday night. The award, accepted by the cast members Dev Patel, Irrfan Khan, Freida Pinto and Anil Kapoor, is likely to raise the film’s fortunes at the Academy Awards. “Slumdog Millionaire” and its director, Danny Boyle, were both nominated for Oscars on Thursday. The television series “30 Rock” was honored by the guild for best comedy ensemble, and “Mad Men” won best drama ensemble. Sean Penn was named best lead actor in a motion picture for “Milk,” Meryl Streep was chosen best lead actress for “Doubt,” and Heath Ledger was honored as best supporting actor for his performance in “The Dark Knight.”
929 2009-01-27 The American Express Company, the credit card company, said Monday that its profit dropped 79 percent in the fourth quarter as cardholders cut back their spending amid the harsh economy and the company took a significant severance-related charge.

Net income dropped to $172 million, or 15 cents a share, from $831 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.

Results included a $273 million charge primarily related to severance costs from previously announced job cuts, as well as a $66 million increase in the company’s membership rewards reserve related to a partnership agreement with Delta Air Lines.

On an adjusted basis, excluding discontinued operations, the company earned $238 million, or 21 cents a share.
930 2009-01-27 “Time Regained,” the title of Charles Wuorinen’s new fantasy for piano and orchestra, is taken from Proust’s novel of that name. Like Proust in this epochal work, Mr. Wuorinen embarks on an exploration of memory, more specifically, in his words, “music’s memory of a part of its past.”

It is indeed possible to hear this formidable 30-minute score as an immense edifice of memory. Yet as the pianist Peter Serkin played its premiere with James Levine and the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon, it was also possible to experience the piece as a homage of a brainy modernist to medieval and Renaissance composers he reveres: Guillaume de Machaut, Matteo de Perugia, Guillaume Dufay and Orlando Gibbons. For those intimidated by some of Mr. Wuorinen’s fiercely complex compositions, this piece gave a glimpse of a contemporary musician in awe of pioneering forebears.

The danger in composing a work that blends actual bits of old music into an astringent atonal contemporary language is that you might wind up with some glib pastiche, like Respighi’s “Ancient Airs and Dances” for orchestra. But Mr. Wuorinen avoided this pitfall by drawing on “only the raw musical data,” as he put it, from the early music sources.

He disregarded the original purpose and every other element of the quoted pieces except for the notes. And sometimes the notes in Machaut, Dufay and other composers of those eras — the weird chords, the passages of ruminative modal counterpoint, the jerky contours of the mingling lines — can sound quite startling to modern ears.

In this hybrid fantasy, fragments of restless Renaissance counterpoint in the piano are filtered through an orchestral haze of modernist cluster chords; medieval melodic lines are stated in the orchestra, then toyed with, distorted and challenged by the feisty piano. In crucial passages the music seems to dwell in some spectral state where elemental diatonic and diffuse atonal harmonies come to terms in a tense standoff.
931 2009-01-27 Pfizer’s acquisition of Wyeth is a validation of Mr. Poussot’s decision to refocus Wyeth on biologics and on vaccines, drugs that are also derived from biological material. One of Wyeth’s other cash cows is Prevnar, a vaccine for children against life-threatening illnesses like meningitis and pneumonia that are caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Prevnar had worldwide revenue of about $2.7 billion last year.

“We became very attractive to a company like Pfizer, because you cannot be the No. 1 pharmaceutical company in the world and have not yet started in biotech,” Mr. Poussot said in an interview on Monday.

Mr. Poussot’s push into biologics was a survival strategy against the eventual lapsed patents on Wyeth best sellers like Effexor, a small-molecule antidepressant that had worldwide sales of $3.9 billion last year. Its patent is due to expire in 2010.

After the Food and Drug Administration approved Enbrel, Mr. Poussot made a big gamble by deciding in 2001 to build a $2 billion plant in South Dublin, Ireland, to make the drug in high volume.

At the time, Wyeth was still working through legal settlements from the debacle over the fen-phen diet drug combination, which was found to damage heart valves. Then, in July 2002, a big National Institutes of Health study found that Wyeth’s best-selling small-molecule menopause drug Prempro could raise the risk of breast cancer and heart disease. A menopause products franchise that had sales of $2 billion in 2001 for Wyeth would eventually drop to half that level.

But the Dublin plant, which opened in 2003, has helped offset the Prempro damage. Mr. Poussot said it was the largest factory of its kind in the world.

To a pharmaceutical giant like Pfizer, such big-molecule assets looked particularly attractive, analysts say. William Tanner, a biotechnology analyst and a managing director of Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank, said it took five years and at least $1 billion to build a biologics plant.

“You either have to make or buy,” Mr. Tanner said. “In Pfizer’s case, they decided to buy.”

There has been a pattern in recent years of traditional pharmaceutical giants buying smaller biologics companies. In 2007, Schering-Plough bought Organon BioSciences for about $14.4 billion, and AstraZeneca bought MedImmune for more than $15 billion. Last year, Eli Lilly bought Imclone Systems for $6.5 billion.

But in acquiring Wyeth, Pfizer is buying another big pharmaceutical company that has built up a sizable business in large molecules.

“We want to become a leader in biotherapeutics and vaccines,” Jeffrey B. Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive, said Monday at the Manhattan news conference where the deal was announced.

David S. Moskowitz, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Caris & Company, an investment bank, said that Wyeth’s diverse portfolio made it more interesting to Pfizer than a pure-play biologics manufacturer like Amgen or other traditional drug makers like Bristol-Myers or Schering-Plough.

“We think Wyeth is the much better play,” Mr. Moskowitz said.

While the deal has the potential to turn Pfizer into a vaccine and biologics powerhouse, it also has potential pitfalls in the form of bapineuzumab, a Wyeth biologic drug for Alzheimer’s disease that is in clinical studies. While current drugs for the disease treat symptoms, Wyeth intends for bapineuzumab to try to attack the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s, a treatment that could be worth billions of dollars if it proved effective.

But the results of a clinical trial made public last year raised questions about the drug’s safety and efficacy. The study showed, among other shortcomings, that the drug did not benefit people who carry a genetic variant that raises the risk of getting Alzheimer’s.

Mr. Poussot said Wyeth had 10 different Alzheimer’s treatments in development, including small-molecule drugs and vaccines.

Wyeth’s Prevnar childhood vaccine, meantime, is seen as successful and destined to become even bigger. The company is working on expanding federal approval for Prevnar to include infants and is studying the drug’s use in adults. It costs about $336 for a series of four injections.

“Prevnar could do $5 to $6 billion by 2015,” said Dr. Tim Anderson, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company and a former practitioner of emergency medicine. “That’s pretty good for a meningitis vaccine.”

Analysts also said that companies with even a few biologics could be in a better position to weather efforts in Washington to overhaul the health care system because biologics are often aimed at rare, grave diseases that have no other treatments. Even though biologics can be much more expensive than small-molecule drugs, their total cost to the health care system is markedly less than drugs that millions of people take for widespread problems like high cholesterol.

Only about 300,000 people in this country take Enbrel, for example.

“In the face of changes in health care reform,” said Mr. Tanner of Leerink Swann, “these drugs might do well.”
932 2009-01-27 Right now, carmakers say they would be able to sell only their smallest, most fuel-efficient cars — models like the Toyota Prius, a hybrid whose sales have fallen sharply since gas prices began dropping last fall — because once-popular vehicles like pickup trucks made by Ford and G.M. are not efficient enough.

“I want clean air and clean water just like the next guy,” said Erich Merkle, an independent automotive analyst in Grand Rapids, Mich. “But in the real world, there would be consumer outrage with the fact that they’re limited to maybe two vehicles and there’s nothing there that would meet their family’s needs.”

Environmental advocates who have long challenged the automakers’ opposition to the proposed California standards say such regulations will help the companies produce vehicles that consumers want.

Failing to invest in reducing emissions and increasing efficiency will only prolong Detroit’s problems, said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“I think this is the pathway to their survival,” Mr. Doniger said. “If carmakers are going to survive in a world of volatile oil prices and global warming, they have to be making more efficient vehicles. When the economy comes back and people start buying cars again, they’re going to expect that gas prices are going to go up, and they’re not going to want the gas hogs that they used to want. Consumers’ tastes have changed in terms of what’s cool.”

One concern automakers have with states regulating tailpipe emissions is that keeping up with a hodgepodge of standards would be difficult. They expressed support Monday for the ideal of cutting emissions but want their engineers to be concerned with meeting just one set of requirements nationally.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 carmakers, said it favored “a nationwide program that bridges state and federal concerns and moves all stakeholders forward, and we are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach,” in a statement from the group’s chief executive, Dave McCurdy.

G.M., the only Detroit automaker to issue its own response Monday, said it was “working aggressively on the products and the advance technologies that match the nation’s and consumers’ priorities to save energy and reduce emissions.” But the company also emphasized the need for “a comprehensive policy discussion that takes into account the development pace of new technologies, alternative fuels and market and economic factors.”

Automakers are operating in the worst market since the early 1980s. New vehicle sales fell nearly 19 percent in 2008 and are universally expected to be even lower in 2009.

Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who has long been one of the Detroit automakers’ strongest allies in Washington, praised the president’s attitude toward global warmingand expressed hope that the administration would act only after studying the effect that “setting a patchwork of different emission standards” would have.

“President Obama and I both share the goal of energy independence and a cleaner environment for our children and grandchildren,” Mr. Dingell said in a statement. “We have a unique opportunity in history to address the issue of global climate change and we must take bold and balanced action.”

Mr. Cole, the Center for Automotive research chairman, said he believed Congress would ensure Detroit would be able to live with any new standards.
933 2009-01-27 The heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar, announced layoffs on Monday and warned of a tough year ahead as a downturn that began in the United States metastasized into a full-blown global recession, gutting orders for its earth-moving equipment.

The world’s largest maker of construction and mining machines, which also reported lower-than expected fourth-quarter earnings, said on Monday it was laying off 17,000 workers, and buying out 2,500 others, to reduce costs in the face of what it predicted would be the weakest year for business since the end of WWII. The company said earlier that it was offering employees incentives to leave voluntarily, the company said.

The company cut its outlook for 2009 and seemed to raise the possibility that it would report a loss in the current quarter.

The news sent Caterpillar shares skidding 8 percent in premarket trading, pulling the broader market lower.

In a statement, the chief executive, James W. Owens, said Caterpillar had been “whipsawed” by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices.

He said the company had responded by encouraging dealers to align their inventory levels with falling volume and “they responded with significant order cancellations, particularly in December.”

The layoffs and buyouts, which will hit one in every 10 of the company’s regular workers and idle 8,000 contract workers, represent the biggest wave of job cuts at Caterpillar since the early 1980s, when the company was losing about $1 million a day.

In addition, the company said it was freezing salaries of most employees and significantly reducing the total compensation of executives and senior managers.

“It’s just a very pessimistic outlook in terms of the world economy,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y.. “Clearly the building of global infrastructure has come to a grinding halt.”

The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of $661 million, or $1.08 a share, compared with $975 million, or $1.50 a share, last year.

The company attributed the drop in profitability to significantly higher operating costs in its manufacturing operations as capacity utilization plunged. It also said a sharp decline in profit in its captive finance unit contributed to the poor showing.

Analysts, on average, expected the company to report a profit of $1.28 a share on sales of $11.97 billion.

After shrugging off the downturn in the housing market that sparked the worldwide crisis, Caterpillar and other makers of bulldozers, dump trucks and excavators have suddenly faced a world of challenges, including a drop in spending by their well-heeled energy and mining customers.
934 2009-01-27 ING, which took 10 billion euros, or about $13 billion, from the Dutch government in October to bolster its capital, said it expected to post a 2008 full-year net loss of about 1 billion euros. Jan Hommen, the former chief financial officer of Philips Electronics and currently chairman of the ING board, will succeed Michel Tilmant as chief executive, the bank said in a statement.

In response the problems in the banking industry, the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, said on Monday that he would invite top executives of the world’s largest banks to London to confer on the global financial crisis in advance of an April 2 meeting of Group of 20 leaders.

Mr. Brown said the government would propose a “charter of principles” governing financial institutions, and that “the measures that then flow from that, whether in relation to hedge funds or derivatives or other financial products, will be in line with principles of transparency and proper disclosure and people assessing and managing their risks.”

In Paris, BNP Paribas, one of the largest French banks, said it expected a fourth-quarter net loss of around 1.4 billion euros, but said it would still manage a full-year 2008 net profit of about 3 billion euros, thanks to “the good performance of retail banking and asset management and services.”

The bank, which reports its earnings on Feb. 19, also said it would convene an extraordinary shareholder meeting to consider a proposal that the bank issue 5.1 billion euros of nonvoting preference shares to the French state as part of a second round of bailout financing by President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government.

Another French bank, Société Générale, said last week that it expected to post a net profit of about 2 billion euros for 2008. The bank said Monday that it would merge its asset management business with that of a rival, Crédit Agricole, to cut costs.

ING said it would cut operating expenses by 1 billion euros this year, bringing savings of approximately 1.1 billion euros a year staring in 2010. Of the cutback, 35 percent will come from cutting 7,000 full-time positions — about 5.4 percent of the work force. The bank will also cut costs for its head office, in marketing and for its Formula One sponsorship.

The company, which posted its first quarterly loss ever in November, said the full-year net loss would result partly from the cost of disposing of an insurance business in Taiwan and ending its pension operations in Argentina.

ING called the October-December period “the worst quarter for equity and credit markets in over half a century.” The MSCI World index of global stocks fell more than 22 percent in the last three months of 2008.

ING said it had reached a deal with the Dutch government to shift 27.7 billion euros of illiquid assets onto the public finances, covering 80 percent of ING’s Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities. Alt-A mortgage loans represent a middle ground between the subprime loans issued to borrowers with poor credit histories and those extended to prime borrowers.

Under the terms of the deal, the Dutch state will acquire the securities at a 10 percent discount to their par value. The government will receive 80 percent of the cash flows of the total portfolio. ING remains the owner of the securities and will still be responsible for 20 percent of any losses.

The transaction “will significantly reduce the uncertainty regarding the impact on ING of any future losses in the portfolio,” the bank said.

“It’s a great deal in the current environment to get those assets off the balance sheet at 90 percent of face value,” Paul Beijsens, a banking analyst at Theodoor Gilissen Bank in Amsterdam, said.

“The transaction will significantly reduce the uncertainty regarding the impact on ING of any future losses in the portfolio,” the bank said. Shares of BNP Paribas rose 12 percent in Paris by midday. ING rose more than 21 percent on the Amsterdam exchange.

Worldwide, banks have written off more than $1 trillion in soured investments since the subprime mortgage meltdown signaled the start of the credit crisis in 2007. Estimates of the ultimate cost range to more than $3.5 trillion.

953 2009-01-28 An independent tribunal established under Britain’s Freedom of Information Act ordered the government to publish the minutes of two cabinet meetings held on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The tribunal ruled that an exception to the practice of keeping such records secret for 30 years was justified by the public’s need to know how the decision to join the American invasion was made. The meetings focused on whether the invasion would be legal under international law. The government has 28 days to appeal the ruling or issue an executive order overruling it.

955 2009-01-28 How much of a difference will the stimulus make?

Two weeks ago, a Congressional committee posted a table of numbers on its Web site that gave an early answer. The numbers came from the Congressional Budget Office and seemed to show that only 38 percent of the money in the bill would be spent by September 2010. That didn’t sound very stimulating, and the numbers soon caused a minor media sensation.

But anyone who looked closely would have seen something strange about the table. It suggested that the bill would cost only $355 billion in all, rather than its actual cost of about $800 billion.

Why? It turns out that the table was analyzing only certain parts of the bill, like new spending on highways, education and energy. It ignored the tax cuts, jobless benefits and Medicaid payments  the very money that will be spent the fastest.

On Monday evening, the Congressional Budget Office put out its analysis of the full bill, and it gave a very different picture. It estimated that about 64 percent of the money, or $526 billion, would be spent by next September.

That timetable may still be slower than ideal, and short of the 75 percent benchmark President Obama has promised, but it isn’t terrible. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars takes time. In fact, for all the criticism the stimulus package has been getting, it does pretty well by several important yardsticks.

First of all, the package really is stimulus. It will quickly give money to the people who have been hardest hit by the recession and who, not coincidentally, will be most likely to spend that money soon. The spending also has a chance to do some long-term good, by paying for the computerization of medical records, the weatherization of homes and other such investments.

By my count, the current package has just one major flaw. It could do a lot more to change how the government spends its money. It doesn’t have nearly the amount of the fresh, reformist thinking as Mr. Obama’s campaign speeches and proposals did. Instead, the bill is mostly a stew of spending on existing programs, whatever their warts may be.

I understand that this approach reflects the realities of political negotiations. It even has some economic merits: it may help speed the flow of money out the door. But it still is a missed opportunity in a few instances.

The biggest is infrastructure. Transportation experts had hoped the package would be the start of not only more spending on infrastructure but also smarter spending on highways, mass transit, sewer systems and other public works. So far, the experts are disappointed.

In the current system, the federal government sends money to states without any real effort to evaluate whether it will pay for worthy projects. States rarely do serious analyses of their own. They build new roads before fixing old ones. They don’t consider whether those new roads will lead to faster traffic or simply more traffic. They spend millions of dollars on legislators’ pet projects and hulking new sports stadiums. In the world of infrastructure, cost-benefit analysis is still a science of the future.

A couple of weeks ago, Ed Rendell, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, came to Washington to talk up infrastructure. He is a member of a tripartisan threesome  along with Michael Bloomberg, New York’s independent mayor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, California’s Republican governor  trying to persuade the country to get serious about infrastructure.

In his talk, Mr. Rendell said he understood that the stimulus bill couldn’t come close to solving all these problems. But it could make some progress, and Mr. Obama’s sky-high approval ratings gave him a wonderful chance to do so. “This is the time to put down some markers  this is the time,” Mr. Rendell said.

And the bill does include a couple of markers. It will list on the Web the projects that the federal government is financing  an idea that, amazingly enough, is considered radical  and will require that mayors and governors sign off on projects. That will make it harder for them to lobby for projects now and criticize those same projects later, as Gov. Sarah Palin did with the Bridge to Nowhere. At least one version of the bill also sets aside $5.5 billion to be awarded by the transportation secretary, supposedly on the merits of a project.

But it’s not clear how that will work, and there is so much more that could be done. The bill could create a small-scale version of an “infrastructure bank,” a free-standing entity that could make more merit-based decisions than Congress does (an idea that Mr. Obama supports). The bill could also finance the creation of new state offices to conduct cost-benefit analyses. It could also help cover the budget shortfalls of public transit systems, instead of simply allocating another $30 billion for the construction of new highways.

Fifty-one transit systems have recently proposed service cuts or fare increases, including those in Atlanta, Denver, New York, Phoenix, St. Louis, San Diego and Washington. If these cuts go through, they will make it harder for people to get to work (or look for work), and they will undermine one of the long-term goals of the stimulus package: laying the groundwork for a greener economy.

It’s not just infrastructure, either. The bill includes big, admirable increases in college financial aid  but appears likely to do little to use those increases to improve higher education. The package will also sprinkle millions of dollars on some debatable projects, like the renovation of the National Mall.

The standard that I’m setting here may seem a bit high. Even with its current flaws, the bill has much to recommend it. It will indeed try to encourage significant changes in health care and K-12 education, for example.

The bill is certainly superior to a huge package of tax cuts, which might be politically popular but end up in people’s bank accounts rather than stimulating the economy. By now, we should know that tax cuts are not a cure-all. The cuts of 2001 and 2003 couldn’t keep the recent expansion from being one of the weakest on record or the current recession from being so deep.

This bill should help the economy in both the near term and the long term. But the government doesn’t go out and spend about $800 billion every day. The details matter.
956 2009-01-28 The White House encouraged other gestures as well. As the House version of the legislation came to the floor on Tuesday, Democrats stripped from it a provision that Republicans had ridiculed as having nothing to do with economic stimulus, one expanding federal coverage of family planning services. (The had estimated that the provision would actually save the government $200 million over five years by reducing and postnatal-care expenses.)

Trying to forestall other Republican attacks, Democrats also stripped out $200 million for restoring the National Mall, another provision that the minority had mocked.

Both parties expect a vote largely along party lines in the House on Wednesday. They say the degree to which the legislation can win any real bipartisan support will depend on what happens in the Senate, where the measure could be altered to attract at least some moderate Republicans.

“The statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation,” Mr. Obama said before heading into lunch with Senate Republicans.

“I don’t expect a hundred percent agreement from my Republican colleagues,” he added, “but I do hope that we can all put politics aside and do the American people’s business right now.”

If Mr. Obama’s separate sessions with House and Senate Republicans on Tuesday did not win him any immediate additional support, they got high marks from Republicans for outreach.

Republican lawmakers said his efforts were a good start toward building a relationship with them that would be vital as Congress and the administration turned to politically divisive issues like health care, tax reform and the long-term financial problems facing Medicare and Social Security.

“This was not a drive-by P.R. stunt, and I actually thought it might be,” said Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of . “It was a substantive, in-depth discussion with our conference, and he’s very effective.”

“He knows that the debt and the deficit are huge long-term problems as well,” Mr. Wamp said, “and he made a compelling case. He sounded, frankly, a lot like a Republican.”

The White House has let House Democrats, led by Speaker of , take the lead so far in pushing the bill — and in drawing fire from Republicans, allowing Mr. Obama to remain at least somewhat detached from the partisan wrangling. But in courting Republican support, whether substantively for the economic package or for longer-term political purposes, Mr. Obama has also risked some tension with members of his own party.

While he is relatively new to Washington, having served less than one term in the Senate, many Democrats who have served longer harbor rancor from past years when Republicans ran Congress and, with in the White House, excluded Democrats from lawmaking.

The Republicans’ main appeal to Mr. Obama was that he should press Congressional Democrats to reach out to the minority. Several Republicans told him that House Democrats had never consulted them in drafting the economic stimulus package.

“The House Democrats have failed at bipartisanship, I think that’s clear, and I think he acknowledged that” by not explicitly disagreeing with complaints he heard from Republicans, said Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of .

House Democrats said the Republicans undercut their own call for bipartisanship when their leader, Representative of , told his colleagues in a meeting before the president arrived that he was going to oppose the House package and that they should, too. That suggested the Republicans were not open to Mr. Obama’s overtures, the Democrats said.

“They have taken a political stance,” said the House majority leader, Representative of .

Mr. Hoyer called that “unfortunate” but also telegraphed his own reluctance to embrace Republican proposals on economic recovery. “I am hard put,” he said, “to take the advice or counsel of people who have followed policies that have put us deeply into debt and led to the weakest economy since the 1930s.”

Representative of , who is among the few moderate Republicans left in the House, said even he was not ready to vote for the House Democrats’ package. But the final compromise with the Senate, assuming it includes more tax cuts and less spending, could get 10 to 15 House Republican votes, Mr. Castle said.

Mr. Obama spoke to House Republicans for about 10 minutes and then took about a dozen questions for an hour, members said. He emphasized the seriousness of the economic emergency and lamented, “I would love to not have to spend this money.”

When reminded that he was late for his Senate meeting, he joked that “my former colleagues can wait,” drawing his biggest applause from the House lawmakers. And while they were not receptive to his policy message, the Republicans were more than happy to have their photographs taken with him as the session wound down.

Mr. Obama brought along his chief economic adviser, , but never turned to him for assistance, Republicans said.

Senate Republicans, though skeptical, were still not willing to issue blanket opposition to the plan emerging in their chamber. They also said Mr. Obama seemed open to changes that could attract Republican support.

“We’re going to continue to try to encourage the majority here in the Congress to incorporate a number of our ideas,” said Senator of , the Republican leader.
957 2009-01-28 PITTSBURGH (AP) — The United States Steel Corporation said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings surged, helped by strong sales of pipes and an acquisition-related gain.

But the company forecast an operating loss in the current quarter because of the global economic slowdown.

U.S. Steel reported its earnings amid an industrywide slump in demand for the metal among major buyers in the automotive, construction and industrial equipment sectors. Steel prices, which reached record highs in the first half of 2008, fell later in the year, and production at domestic steel mills hit its lowest levels in a quarter century.

The company, the largest steel producer based in the United States, said its net income jumped to $308 million, or $2.65 a share, from $35 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The earlier quarter included charges totaling $117 million, or 98 cents a share.

Quarterly sales rose to $4.57 billion from $4.54 billion last year, helped by strong sales from the company’s tubular steel business.

The latest results included a gain of $76 million, or 65 cents a share, related to an acquisition.

U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, rose $2.30, or 8 percent, to $31.76 a share.
958 2009-01-28 Over the last 19 months, the who-said-what-and-when about the travel documents has kept several different investigative bodies busy. It was stupefying. What seems to have been the last of the investigations wound up a few days ago.

In the meantime, far more serious problems have overtaken both Mr. Spitzer, who resigned after he was caught patronizing a prostitution ring, and Mr. Bruno, who resigned six months before he was indicted on corruption charges that he says have no merit.

Meanwhile, the drama of Ms. Kennedy’s still-unexplained last-minute departure from the pool of Senate candidates has obscured two other political developments. One is plain to see: in choosing Kirsten E. Gillibrand of upstate Hudson for the Senate, Mr. Paterson has extended his political alliances far from his base in New York City.

The other is that he has made an alliance much closer to home: Alfonse M. D’Amato, the former senator, stood alongside Mr. Paterson for the announcement of Ms. Gillibrand’s appointment. She worked as an intern in Mr. D’Amato’s Senate office for two summers.

Mr. D’Amato, a Republican from Long Island who served three terms in the Senate, left official power in 1998, after being defeated by Charles E. Schumer. He got over it pretty quickly. While George E. Pataki was governor, Mr. D’Amato became a major lobbyist. At one point, he was paid $500,000 for helping a building owner who was making a deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The task required no heavy lifting beyond a phone call to the authority’s chairman.

The rise of a government controlled by Democrats in Albany has not stopped Mr. D’Amato. He has become one of the major fund-raisers for Mr. Paterson, an article by Wayne Barrett on the Village Voice Web site reported. The article noted that many of the same D’Amato clients who attended the fund-raiser for Mr. Paterson had also attended a fund-raiser for John McCain’s campaign, “a symmetry that knows no ideology, only D’Amato connections.”

Mr. Paterson came to power because he happened to be sitting in the drowsy calm of the lieutenant governor’s office when Mr. Spitzer was caught paying an escort service. Before serving as lieutenant governor, he had been the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, a position of virtually no power in Albany. Many people who knew him assumed that he came to the governor’s office with a talent for politics, not policy.

His role in the awkward departure of Ms. Kennedy may have flipped that view around. Still, he did not just make enemies; in choosing Ms. Gillibrand, who has a substantial résumé to go along with strong political connections, he has made new friends in parts of the state where he is not well known. And it doesn’t hurt the governor to have friendly relations with Mr. D’Amato. Besides his gifts as a fund-raiser, Mr. D’Amato also happens to be a longtime enemy of Rudolph W. Giuliani, said to be considering running for governor next year.

Nevertheless, Mr. Paterson was still being asked on Tuesday about his role in the Kennedy leaks.

“I’m going to address this issue for the last time,” he began, a bit optimistically.
959 2009-01-28 LOS ANGELES — Costly state incentives to lure film production and jobs may be paying off, at least in New York.

A study of New York’s tax breaks for movie and television production suggested that a 30 percent credit offered by the state, with an additional 5 percent offered by New York City, could be expected to keep or create about 19,500 jobs while yielding $404 million in tax revenue, at a cost of $215 million in credits.

But the benefits were heavily weighted toward New York City, which attracted by far the largest share of production with New York-based television series like “Ugly Betty” and “30 Rock” and movies like “Notorious,” a rap music drama released by Fox Searchlight this month. The city collects about 6.4 times as much in taxes from film as it spends on incentives, the study said.

The study, completed last week, was conducted by the accounting firm Ernst & Young for both the Motion Picture Association of America and the film office of New York State.

In recent years, states like New York, Michigan and Louisiana have used aggressive subsidies to compete for film jobs, but comprehensive reviews of their impact have been few and far between.
960 2009-01-28 The E*Trade Financial Corporation, the online brokerage firm, posted a fourth-quarter loss Tuesday, but the result was an improvement from the year-earlier period when it recorded a charge of more than $2 billion for securities losses.

E*Trade reported a loss of $275.6 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.71 billion, or $3.98 a share, in the period a year earlier. The 2007 fourth-quarter results included a $2.28 billion pretax loss on the sale of asset-backed securities.

Income from commission, fees and other service charges fell 16 percent, to $223.7 million from $266.2 million.

While the company’s provision for loan losses remained elevated, it was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. E*Trade set aside $512.9 million during the fourth quarter to cover potential future loan losses. That was down slightly from the third-quarter provision of $517.8 million, and up from a provision of $402.3 million in the year-earlier period. Total allowance for loan losses now stands at $1.1 billion.
961 2009-01-28 But he is a newcomer to the great humanitarian wait for Gaza.

“We are getting a lot of assistance, but they let very few trucks through,” said Hany Moustafa, who manages the stadium. “We have trucks we loaded up five days ago still sitting here, waiting.”

There has been an outpouring of support for Gazans, mostly from the Arab world, but also from Europe, Venezuela and nongovernmental organizations, officials here said. Medical supplies go straight into Gaza through Egypt’s crossing at Rafah.

But Egypt will not allow anything else to pass through Rafah, insisting that all other aid travel first into Israel and then into Gaza. That is where the bottleneck has occurred. Two of the main problems have been the short window for supplies to pass and Israel’s decision to let few trucks go through, officials and volunteers here said. But another problem has to do with Egypt’s being unprepared to meet strict Israeli packing requirements, which would allow the goods to be passed through security scanners and onto Israeli trucks for delivery to Gaza.

The Egyptians tried to send through trucks carrying bags of flour and sugar, for example, only to have the Israelis send them back. Much has been repacked and reshipped, but some of the returned items are spilled out over the sandy earth at the crossing.

“The trucks get to Auja and they sit,” said Ahmed Oraby, head of the Red Crescent office in El Arish. “Many trucks that left are now coming back. They don’t take anything.”

At the United Nations, John Holmes, an emergency relief coordinator, said the scale of the destruction meant that far more than the current movement of aid was needed urgently. “Enough will always be allowed in for people to exist, but not enough for the conditions for people to live,” Mr. Holmes told reporters.

In recent days, officials and drivers at the crossing said that the trickle of trucks passing through this month had all but stopped. None went on Thursday. Friday and Saturday are days off, so nothing passed. On Sunday, a few trucks went through, aid workers said. Monday, nothing. Tuesday, nothing.

“I have been sitting here for three days, and before that I was in Arish for four days,” said Sayed Ahmed Sorour, seated in the cab of a truck hauling clothing and blankets. “Nobody is telling us anything. Not Egypt. Not Israel. Nobody explains to us why we are stopping here.”

Mr. Sorour’s truck was about 10th in line in front of the gate to enter the border zone. About 30 trucks in all were parked outside the gate, their drivers tired, dirty and frustrated after days of waiting, sleeping in their cabs and killing time.

Inside the gate, parked in the sand near the border with Israel, there were an additional 30 truckloads of flour and sugar and, from the French, the technical gear and bottles of Evian. An Egyptian state security officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of his work, said there did not seem to be any rational explanation for how the crossing worked. He said he and the other officers simply waited for the Israelis to tell them how many trucks to let in, and they complied.

By 5 p.m., when it was clear that Yasir Hussein was not going to get to deliver his goods, again, he and some other drivers laid down a blanket, warmed some water on a small gas burner and shared small glasses of tea. Mr. Hussein said he was hauling a load of food donated by the Swiss and had been sitting at the gate since Thursday.

“We are not moving, and no one is saying anything,” he said. “We are just trying to help.”
962 2009-01-28 BRUSSELS — A top European Union court rejected on Tuesday a request by Intel, the chip maker, to delay an investigation into whether the company broke antitrust laws.

Regulators at the European Commission have been investigating Intel’s business practices since the start of the decade, after a complaint by a rival, Advanced Micro Devices, also of the United States.

The commission suspects Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers, by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices that are below actual cost.

Intel, which denies wrongdoing, argued before the European Court of First Instance in October that the investigation was being mishandled. The company also said it needed more time to prepare its defense.

On Tuesday, Marc Jaeger, the president of the court, dismissed that claim. The Court of First Instance is the European Union’s second-highest tribunal.

Intel “was in no way prevented,” according to Mr. Jaeger, “from preparing and submitting, in good time, its reply” to the accusations brought against the company by regulators.

Robert Manetta, a spokesman for Intel, said the company was disappointed at the outcome.

“We are still very concerned about the lack of certain documents in the case file that would help us conduct an effective defense,” Mr. Manetta said.
963 2009-01-28 Nine dissident scientists at the Food and Drug Administration who say they were forced to approve high-risk medical devices sent a letter to President Obama on Monday stating that agency officials might have made them the targets of a criminal investigation into their complaints.

“It has been brought to our attention that F.D.A. management may have just recently ordered the F.D.A. Office of Criminal Investigations (O.C.I.) to investigate us rather than the managers who have engaged in wrongdoing!” states the letter, which was provided to The New York Times. “It is an outrage that our own agency would step up the retaliation to such a level because we have reported their wrongdoing to the United States Congress.”

Heidi Rebello, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said she could neither confirm nor deny the existence of a criminal investigation.

The letter is the latest escalation in a highly unusual internal battle that has been simmering for nearly a year within the agency’s device division. The nine scientists have banded together and charged that agency officials have acted illegally and that patients are routinely put at risk from high-risk medical devices that are approved for sale even though manufacturers have never proved that the products are either safe or effective.

The scientists complained in May to Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, who was then the F.D.A. commissioner, and the agency began an internal review that continues. Dissatisfied with the pace and results of that review, the scientists wrote a letter to Congress in October pleading for an investigation, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce announced in November that it would begin one, which also continues.
964 2009-01-28 “Milk,” directed by Gus Van Sant, was among five movies nominated by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for outstanding wide-release film in itsannual media awards. The organization, which said its awards seek to recognize “fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community,” also named “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” “Brideshead Revisited,” “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” and “RocknRolla” in this category. Among TV series, “Brothers & Sisters,” “The L Word,” “South of Nowhere,” “Torchwood” and “True Blood” were nominated for outstanding drama, and “Desperate Housewives,” “Greek,” “Reaper,” “Skins” and “Ugly Betty” were nominated for comedy. Winners are to be honored at events in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco in the spring.
965 2009-01-28 WASHINGTON  The new Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, announced on Tuesday that he would crack down on lobbying to influence the $700 billion financial bailout program by companies that are receiving billions in taxpayer money.

Mr. Geithner, who was confirmed on Monday, also said he would set new limits intended to prevent political interference with decisions about which companies received bailout money.

Among other steps, the Treasury department said it would make public a log of all contacts by public officials and bank officials regarding specific financial institutions.

The log will be posted on the department’s Web site and updated weekly, it said.

The announcement followed several recent news reports about attempts by corporate lobbyists and members of Congress to influence the bailout program, including decisions about which banks should receive taxpayer funds.

“American taxpayers deserve to know that their money is spent in the most effective way to stabilize the financial system,” Mr. Geithner said in a statement. “Today’s actions reaffirm our commitment toward that goal.”

The details of the new rules, whose text has not been completed, were not released. But in a press release, the Treasury Department outlined the Obama administration’s intent to restrict corporate and political lobbying to influence the bailout program.

Among the changes will be rules to “combat lobbyist influence” over the bailout program, including by “restricting contacts with lobbyists in connection with applications for, or disbursements of” bailout funds, the department said.

A Treasury spokeswoman said the department’s lawyers were developing rules to adopt such a restriction to the extent allowed by law and would make the procedures public. The changes will not require legislation by Congress or regulations, she said.

Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there was no legal impediment to barring Treasury officials from talking about specific matters with lobbyists, although the First Amendment would not permit the government to forbid people from trying to lobby it.

The New York Times reported on Jan. 24 that at least a dozen companies that received taxpayer funds from the bailout program lobbied the government about the program in the final months of 2008, according to their lobbying disclosure forms.

The new rules will also “ensure that political influence does not interfere” with bailout “decision making, using as a model for these protections the limits on political influence over tax matters,” the Treasury said.

The tax investigation safeguards include rules to keep executive branch officials, including those at the White House, from ordering the Internal Revenue Service to conduct or terminate an audit of a particular taxpayer. If copied for the bailout program, the rule would prevent such officials from intervening in particular decisions about which banks get which funds.

The Treasury spokeswoman also said the department would disclose communications with members of Congress, along with bank executives, as part of its plan to make public all contacts about the bailout program.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 22 that several members of Congress, including lawmakers from Ohio and Alabama, had tried to ensure that regulators would steer bailout funds to banks in their states.

The article focused in particular on efforts by the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, to help a troubled minority-owned bank in Boston. It later received $12 million in bailout money.

In a phone interview, Mr. Frank said he had no problem with Treasury posting a log of communications with members of Congress. He said he had been very public about his support for the Boston bank, and said lawmakers wanted their constituents to know of such efforts.

The Treasury said letters and calls from Congress played no role in its decisions about which banks received money. Mr. Geithner also declared that the Office of Financial Stability at Treasury, in making reports to Congress about how it was disbursing the bailout funds, would certify that each decision was based only on “investment criteria and the facts of the case.”

The department said it would soon publish a detailed description of its investment review process. And it said that only banks recommended by their primary bank regulator would be eligible for bailout funds.

The announcement on Tuesday represented the latest step by the Obama administration to make the bailout program more open and accountable as it moved to disburse the second $350 billion, following criticism of the Bush administration’s handling of the first $350 billion of the program.

Another set of rules on lobbyists imposed by President Obama will affect Mr. Geithner’s chief of staff, Mark Patterson, who lobbied for Goldman Sachs as recently as last April. Under the new rules, Mr. Patterson cannot be involved in dealing with any issues involving Goldman or other issues on which he lobbied.

The Obama administration has already said it will step up monitoring of lending patterns by financial institutions that have received bailout money. It also said it would seek to limit executive pay at banks that received taxpayer help in the future.

During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Geithner said the bailout needed “serious reform” and pledged that the administration would impose “tough conditions” to protect taxpayers.
966 2009-01-28 “I was like in an outer-body experience it was so hot,” Williams said.

Williams still struggled in the shade. Kuznetsova served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, but despite her intimidating game and 2004 United States Open title, she has a history of cracking under the greatest pressure. Williams, a winner of nine Grand Slam singles titles, does not.

As she has so often in her long, remarkable career, Williams found a way to win, and her latest roar-from-behind victory broke up what was looking like a historic, Russians-only round in the semifinals.

“I was in a lot of trouble today, but you know, I just relaxed and I really wanted to fight and at least go three sets,” Williams said. “I said, ‘Serena you can do it.’ That’s when I play my best."

Although Williams is the only player remaining who has won a Grand Slam singles title, her road will not necessarily become easier. Her semifinal opponent will be Elena Dementieva, who has beaten Williams three times in a row, most recently in Sydney this month, 6-3, 6-1.

Dementieva has been playing the best tennis of any woman this season, winning her first two tournaments in Auckland and Sydney. Dementieva was impressive again in Wednesday’s first match, extending her winning streak by defeating the promising Spanish newcomer Carla Suarez Navarro, 6-2, 6-2.

The match was played outdoors in its entirety with temperatures in the high 90s.

In Thursday’s other women’s semifinal, No. 3 Dinara Safina will face No. 7 Vera Zvonareva. Safina, the younger sister of the former Australian Open men’s champion Marat Safin, is now well on her way to making a name of her own here.

Safina advanced by putting an end — barely — to the sentimental run of the Australian wild card Jelena Dokic on Tuesday night by winning 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

Meanwhile, the defending men’s champion Novak Djokovic retired from his match against Andy Roddick, citing cramps and fatigue and dizziness, with Roddick leading 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2, 2-1.

“Really unfortunate way to end up my Australian Open 2009,” the third-seeded Djokovic said. “Really tried my best, but sometimes, you can’t fight against your own body."

Djokovic’s body betrays him more often than most of the game’s leading men. Since 2005, he has retired from seven matches: four times in Grand Slam play (Roger Federer, by way of comparison, has never retired from a professional match). Tuesday’s decision did not sit well with some members of Roddick’s camp, who were displeased that Djokovic’s decision to quit had detracted from a sparkling performance from Roddick, the seventh-seeded American.

“Andy would never, never have done the same thing,” Roddick’s agent, Ken Meyerson, said. “He would have finished the match. I like Novak, and I know him pretty well, but this particular match, you would have had to shoot my client to get him off the court at 2-1 down in the fourth. He would have done the right thing.”

Roddick, who will face Federer in his first Grand Slam semifinal in two years, expressed no disappointment with Djokovic. “It is what it is,” Roddick said. “That’s sports. That’s what makes it fun. There’s no script. I’m extremely satisfied with what I’ve done so far in this tournament. How you get there is details.”

The details may be of interest to others, however. Roddick, 26, had a disappointing season in the major events last year but is a trimmer, more dangerous player so far this year. He has a fresh voice in his head, courtesy of his new, well-traveled coach Larry Stefanki. Stefanki is just as much of an extrovert as Roddick, and he has made a habit of helping players find an extra gear in mid-career.

At Stefanki’s urging, Roddick dropped more than 10 pounds in the off-season in an attempt to improve his quickness and staying power. He certainly was the fitter, stronger man in the heat on Tuesday, when temperatures significantly exceeded 100 degrees on the court.

After a strong first set, in which he dominated the tie breaker with his forehand, Djokovic’s energy and level of play dipped. Roddick, once an exuberant sort, remained self-contained: hustling, putting first serves into play and playing and passing consistently from the baseline.
967 2009-01-28 Arthur Nadel, the Florida fund manager whose family reported him missing in early January, was arrested Tuesday on criminal charges of securities fraud, federal officials said.

An F.B.I. spokeswoman in New York, Monica McLean, said Mr. Nadel  the head of Scoop Management, overseeing six hedge funds he had valued at more than $300 million  would make an initial appearance in a federal court in Florida.

“Arthur Nadel surrendered in the company of two lawyers to F.B.I. agents in Tampa,” Ms. McLean said.

In a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Nadel was charged with securities fraud and wire fraud related to his funds from around 2004 until at least Jan. 14 this year.

The court document contains excerpts of a handwritten letter from Mr. Nadel, 76, to his wife. It says the letter was found by Scoop employees in an office shredding machine.

“The avenues to money for you will likely be blocked soon,” the letter quoted in an affidavit by an F.B.I. agent, Kevin Riordan, said. “You must use the trust (yours) to your benefit as much and as soon as possible.”

Mr. Nadel, head of Scoop Management, which is based in Sarasota, Fla., was reported missing by his family a week ago. He left behind a suicide note that expressed guilt for losing clients’ money and said someone might try to kill him.

The Nadel case broke about a month after the arrest and charge of the investment manager Bernard L. Madoff, who authorities said confessed to running “a giant Ponzi scheme” over many years. Prosecutors have called the Ponzi scheme, one in which early investors are paid with money from new clients, the biggest in history.

The authorities have announced a rash of Ponzi-type schemes across the United States after the sharp decline in the fortunes of the financial industry.

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in a civil complaint, charged Mr. Nadel with fraud, saying that the six hedge funds contained less than $1 million. The court has frozen Mr. Nadel’s assets.

His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
968 2009-01-28 Battered home values in 20 of America’s biggest metropolitan areas fell even farther in November, according to a widely watched measure of housing prices released Tuesday.

Home prices in November dropped 18.2 percent from a year earlier, not quite as bad as economists had expected, according to the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Prices in 11 of the 20 metropolitan areas surveyed fell at record rates, and 14 areas reported double-digit declines from November 2007.

The 20-city index for November fell to 154.59, its lowest point since January 2004.

“The disappointing news is that the declines are still accelerating,” said Adam York, an economic analyst at Wachovia. “It emphasizes just how much stress the housing market is under.”

The problems were most pronounced in parts of the country like southern California, south Florida and the Southwest, where prices of houses and land once doubled, or even tripled, in a single year, and developers rushed to lay out quilts of new subdivisions and build condos.

In the Phoenix metro area, home prices fell 32.9 percent in November from a year earlier, and they tumbled 31.6 percent in Las Vegas. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, prices declined 30.8 percent from last year.
969 2009-01-28 Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that it lost $1.44 billion in the last three months of 2008 after it took a huge charge related to employee stock awards.

The results fell short of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Delta fell $2, or 20 percent, to $7.93.

Delta said it had a total net loss of $607 million in the fourth quarter related to fuel hedges. After locking in prices that looked reasonable earlier in 2008, some airlines finished the year paying substantially more than market price for a portion of their fuel.

The airline, which is based in Atlanta, also projected that 2009 consolidated passenger unit revenue would be down 4 percent. It reiterated its previously announced plans to cut capacity 6 to 8 percent this year.

The carrier’s net loss in the fourth quarter was $2.11 a share. That compares with a loss of $70 million, or 18 cents a share, for the period a year earlier. The loss in the latest quarter included a $904 million charge related to employee stock awards.

Delta had said that when it completed its acquisition of Northwest Airlines, it would issue a nearly 13.4 percent equity stake in the combined airline to employees.

Excluding special items, Delta said it lost $340 million, or 50 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who generally exclude one-time items from their estimates, expected a loss of 34 cents a share. Delta said the analyst estimates did not factor in a loss of 12 cents a share related to an accounting change.

Revenue rose 43 percent, to $6.71 billion, in the fourth quarter.

Delta completed its acquisition of Northwest on Oct. 29.

For all of 2008, Delta said it lost $8.92 billion, or $19.08 a share, in contrast to a profit of $1.6 billion in 2007.

Analysts expect Delta to post another loss for the first quarter of this year, but to start turning a profit after that.
970 2009-01-28 Verizon, the telecommunications company, reported fourth-quarter sales on Tuesday that fell short of Wall Street projections as layoffs and other cost-cutting took a toll on the telephone and Internet business.

The company said that consumers and companies were cutting landlines at an accelerating rate, leading to a sharp decline in profit in that part of its business.

The wireless side of Verizon, which in recent years has buoyed the company, had mixed results. Revenue and profit margins grew, but fewer customers joined Verizon Wireless than a year ago, and a slightly higher percentage of customers left. Over all, Verizon reported sales of $24.6 billion in the fourth quarter, shy of the $25 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts. In the period a year earlier, the company reported sales of $23.6 billion.

For the fourth quarter, Verizon reported net income of $1.7 billion, or 61 cents a share, a figure that excluded one-time charges. On that basis, Wall Street analysts had projected a profit of 61 cents a share. A year ago, the company had net income of $1.8 billion, or 62 cents a share.

“Given all the financial turmoil, we feel pretty good about the results,” said Dennis F. Strigl, president and chief operating officer of Verizon.

987 2009-01-29 The owner of a leather-goods factory was sentenced to a year in prison Tuesday for harboring and concealing illegal immigrants at the plant, which agents raided in 2007. The man, Francesco Insolia, pleaded guilty in November. He said in court he took full responsibility for not taking any action after being informed that illegal immigrants were working in his factory in New Bedford. “I’m responsible for the conduct,” Mr. Insolia said. “Never in my worst nightmare would I think I’d find myself in the position I am in today.” Mr. Insolia’s company, Michael Bianco Inc., was ordered to pay $1 million for 18 counts of knowingly hiring illegal immigrants from 2004 to late 2006. When the factory was raided in March 2007, federal authorities arrested 361 workers, most of them from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
988 2009-01-29 The mayor of Gulfport pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to get disaster assistance to repair a beachfront home after Hurricane Katrina. The mayor, Brent Warr, and his wife, Laura, pleaded not guilty to charges in a 16-count indictment. Mr. Warr said that the charges had nothing to do with his role as mayor and that he would continue to run Gulfport, a coastal city of about 73,000 people. The Warrs are accused of seeking a grant for a storm-damaged beachfront home they owned but did not live in. The government is seeking forfeiture of $222,798. Mr. Warr, 45, and his wife, 43, also are accused of making false claims to their insurance company.
989 2009-01-29 With José Calderón back in the lineup, the Toronto Raptors are hoping the second half of the season is a lot better than the first.

Calderón had 17 points and 11 assists and the visiting Raptors escaped with a 107-106 victory over the Nets on Wednesday night after Nets point guard Devin Harris missed an open 16-foot jumper at the buzzer.

“We’ve got to be more aggressive and try to make plays for one another,” said Calderón, whose return from a hamstring injury has sparked the Raptors’ first three-game winning streak since the start of the season. “We need more games like tonight, where we make a good defensive play at the end.”

Harris got what he wanted on the final shot, a step-back jumper from the right edge of the foul line that hit off the rim. “That’s my go-to move,” he said. “I couldn’t ask for anything more.”

Anthony Parker added 21 points, and Chris Bosh had 18 for the Raptors, who shot almost 56 percent and had six players in double figures.
990 2009-01-29 A year after Caporn went to St. Mary’s, his friend Daniel Kickert followed from Australia. He would become the program’s leading career scorer, helping the Gaels to a record-tying 25 victories and the N.C.A.A. tournament in 2005. Kickert’s success led others to follow, the most important being guard Patrick Mills, who arrived last year.

Mills, a first-team all-conference selection, was the only men’s player from an American college at the Beijing Olympics. Playing for Australia, he scored 22 points against Argentina and drew praise from United States Coach Mike Krzyzewski for his performance against the N.B.A. stars Chris Paul and Deron Williams.

Mills is one of five Australians on this year’s St. Mary’s team. Guard Carlin Hughes, a senior, is the best perimeter shooter. The junior center Ben Allen, the senior forward Lucas Walker and the freshman guard Clint Steindl contribute off the bench.

Even if Mills departs to the N.B.A. next year, St. Mary’s has signed three more recruits from Australia who will arrive in the fall. They, like many of their predecessors, are products of the Australian Institute of Sport, a sort of trade school for young athletes.

“The basketball community is small over there,” Bennett said last week, after the Gaels routed host San Diego, 65-42, in their first national television appearance this season. “They all know one another. We got in there early, and they’ve had success and good news travels fast.”

“This kid right here is a really good player, but he’s skinny and young,” Bennett said. “Syracuse can get your McDonald’s all-Americans, so can UConn and U.C.L.A. These kids won’t get to play in those situations, at least early in their career. We’re able to get him minutes. Other places, he might get lost in the shuffle.”

Australia is hardly an untapped source of basketball talent. Andrew Bogut became the N.B.A.’s top draft pick after two seasons at Utah, and A. J. Ogilvy is starring at Vanderbilt. But it seems to work better at St. Mary’s than anywhere else.

Allen transferred from Indiana, and Hughes and Walker transferred from Montana State-Billings.

Although Allen, Hughes, Walker and Steindl share a townhouse, the atmosphere in the locker room is as much cross-over culture as it is cross-over dribbling. The Aussies are asked if kangaroos and emus are everywhere, Hughes said. The Americans have exposed them to experiences that don’t exist at home.

Mills’s best friend — or, as he says, mate — is Yusef Smith, a senior forward from the Bronx.

Smith is planning a trip to Canberra, the Australian capital and Mills’s hometown, and he wants to show Mills around New York. Smith pronounces Melbourne like a local (Mel-buhn), is tantalized by Australian beaches and offers a thumbs up to Cadbury chocolates. As for Vegemite, the pungent spread that is part of Australians’ DNA? Forget it.

“It doesn’t look too edible,” Smith said. “And it doesn’t smell too good, either.”

That the Australians feel so comfortable is not lost on them.

“There’s five of us, so that’s a lot to handle,” Mills said. “At first it starts with the team. They’ve really accepted that. And from there, it’s blossomed out into the community, the alumni, into extended friends and family. And for us, we couldn’t be more grateful. The next Australian person that we get to talk to is 14,000 miles away on the other side of the world. So it’s good to really have that homey environment.”

It’s certainly homey inside the 3,500-seat McKeon Pavilion, where baskets by Australians are greeted with the traditional Australian sports chant: “Ozzie! Ozzie! Ozzie! Oy! Oy! Oy!” Australian flags and T-shirts are commonplace. And the players have introduced bawdy postgame locker-room chants, which are as tightly a kept secret as they are R-rated.

“They’ve brought such a good spirit,” said Mike Johnson, an alumnus who waved a green-and-yellow boxing Kangaroo flag during the win over San Diego. “They’re respectful, and they’re a class act on and off the court.”

That the Aussies have been so welcomed is in part a reflection of their country’s unpretentious ethos.

“They don’t get big-headed,” Bennett said, pointing to Mills as a prime example. “He’s confident — a very good player — but he’s not full of himself at all. You just don’t see that very often. A guy that caliber of player that’s had as much recognition and attention, and he’s just as down to earth as a guy who plays eight minutes a game.”

Meshing neatly with the Australians are the two starting post players from the Bay Area, Diamon Simpson and Omar Samhan. Simpson had planned to enroll at Fresno State until there was a coaching change and Samhan was going to attend the University of San Francisco until he was sunk by a poor SAT score. Ian O’Leary, a versatile senior forward from Sacramento, is the other starter.

San Diego Coach Bill Grier, a former Gonzaga assistant, said this was Bennett’s best team. “They seem tougher, mentally and physically,” Grier said. “They have all the pieces.”

It’s a dramatic change from when Bennett took over. As he stood in a hallway outside the visitor’s locker room in San Diego, he looked back, noting that the pipeline to Australia wasn’t part of any master plan.

“It’s funny how things work,” he said, marveling at how the talent from Down Under might put his team over the top.
991 2009-01-29 WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved, and sent to the full Senate, the nomination of Eric H. Holder Jr. to be the nation’s 82nd attorney general.

The committee vote was 17 to 2, with only two Republicans, Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, voting against the nomination.

Some Republicans had hoped to make the Holder nomination a demonstration of party strength in the face of a Democratic-controlled White House and Congress. But the air went out of that effort even before Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican, said on Tuesday that he would support Mr. Holder’s nomination.

The nomination of Mr. Holder, who would be the nation’s first African-American attorney general, will go to the Senate floor in the next few days.

Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and committee chairman, said Mr. Holder’s background as deputy attorney general, a trial judge and a lawyer in private practice made him highly qualified for the post. While any senator was free to oppose the nomination, Mr. Leahy said, “I think they will be on the wrong side of history.”

Mr. Cornyn said he based his opposition on what he said was Mr. Holder’s unwillingness to demonstrate a full commitment to fighting terrorism and his role in facilitating a pardon eight years ago of Marc Rich, a financier who had fled the country to avoid prosecution.

Mr. Holder testified before the committee that he had made a mistake in recommending the Rich pardon. But Mr. Cornyn said that despite that statement, “I am left with remaining doubt about his political independence.”
992 2009-01-29 But absinthe, a liqueur that can have an alcohol content as high as 75 percent, was also known as the Green Fairy, a malicious sprite that was said to twist men’s — and women’s — minds and cause delirium, hallucinations, vertigo and even madness.

By the early 20th century, governments around the world were banning it. Absinthe lovers denied its toxicity, and blamed the wine industry for seeking to sideline a competitor. (Modern analysis has shown that the absinthes produced today have none of these effects.)

So how did the link between the shock rock singer, actor and artist and this drowsy village come about? It began in 2005, after Switzerland, following the example of the United States and many countries in Europe, legalized the production of absinthe.

The man who revived absinthe in Kallnach is Oliver Matter, whose great-grandfather first distilled schnapps here in the 1920s and shipped products to the Chicago World’s Fair in 1933 under the brand name Will Tell.

In 2004, just two months before absinthe was legalized by a Swiss national referendum, Mr. Matter turned his stills, big copper spheres in a shed just outside of town, to making the liqueur. “Actually I didn’t want to,” he said, leading a visitor through the still. “But I had a recipe. My great-grandfather was once owed money by a livestock trader who couldn’t pay him, so he gave him a recipe for absinthe instead. I had big mountains of my great-grandfather’s papers, and that’s where I found the recipe.”

After absinthe was banned by the Swiss in 1910, it went underground. “You could find it in every household,” said Mr. Matter, 40, a lanky man with a shaven head. “It was kept as medicine.”

By one guess, more than 20,000 gallons of this moonshine absinthe were produced annually, an estimate made possible because the orderly Swiss were meticulous about paying the alcohol tax.

Obviously, the world was ripe for the return of absinthe. Within days of beginning production, Mr. Matter was contacted by distributors seeking to sell his absinthe in big markets like England, France and the United States, where absinthe was rapidly becoming a craze.

One of the distributors who contacted Mr. Matter was Markus Lion, 41, a compact, lively businessman from southern Germany who was looking for quality absinthe for a particular customer, Marilyn Manson, whose manager was friendly with Mr. Lion. “Absinthe was becoming a topic,” Mr. Lion said. “And Manson was known as a connoisseur of absinthe.”

After a concert in Basel, a Swiss city northeast of here, Mr. Lion met Mr. Manson, a k a Brian Hugh Warner, and discovered they had friends and tastes in common, including absinthe. They agreed to produce a special absinthe, to be called Mansinthe, at Mr. Matter’s distillery.

After several trial distillations, Mansinthe was introduced in the summer of 2006, selling for about $65 for a 24-ounce bottle. Sales soared in the remaining months of 2006, to more than four times the total amount of absinthe Mr. Matter sold the year before. Now absinthe accounts for about half his annual sales of $1.3 million.

Soon the name Manson was on everyone’s tongue in Kallnach. Now Fritz Meyer, 68, stocks Mansinthe on the liquor shelves of his butcher and grocery store along Kallnach’s main road, next to bottles of Jack Daniel’s and Baileys Irish Cream. He sells pork sausages flavored with absinthe. “They’re very popular,” he said.

Mansinthe, Mr. Lion said, “gave a real push to the absinthe world.”

“We didn’t have to do much else,” he continued. “Manson was already a very controversial figure, just like the artists of the 19th century. So for me he was the ideal partner.”

Mr. Matter, who now has a T-shirt with the words “The Manson Gang” and “66.6 percent,” for the alcohol content of Mansinthe, said he was astounded by how well Mr. Manson was accepted locally, though he had never visited the village. “Curiously, no one ever came to us and said, ‘Why are you doing something like this?’ ”

Stefan Johner, 19, said he was not surprised. An apprentice mechanic who fixes tractors, he said he had never tried absinthe, preferring beer or wine, or whiskey or vodka if he wanted stronger drink. But he agreed that absinthe had a “certain tradition” locally.

Did Marilyn Manson fit in that tradition? “A little bit for sure,” he said. “He’s a little bit crazy,” he went on, his hands deep in the pockets of greasy blue overalls. “In Kallnach there are perfectly normal people, but also some who are a little bit crazy.”
993 2009-01-29 YOGA is a wonderful workout that every man should try once. It expands the mind, the lungs, the sense of self — seeming to offer all kinds of fresh, undiscovered freedoms. Like total freedom from caring how you look as you drip in sweat trying to hold in plow pose for 45 breaths.

And yoga offers men one extra liberation — from that terrible bondage of good, attractive attire.

While the market in yogacentric clothing for women is bursting at its fashionable seams, the choices for men are laughably sparse. They range from absurdly large, overly modest basketball shorts that bag downward in inversion poses to alarmingly tiny shorts that provide freedom of movement but give your classmates a far-too-clear view of your, uh, chakras.

“It’s slim pickins in the men’s yoga world,” said Karyn Riale, the national retail buyer for Pure Yoga, the new Equinox yoga studio. “It’s an untapped market, but it’s a funny market.” Funny, she said, because in spite of specific pieces that are designed well — she cited the simple black pants from Be Present as example — men are reluctant to buy dedicated yoga clothes, if they even know about them.

“It seems like there’s a whole boutique missing,” said Norman Gholson, a lawyer in Washington who has been doing yoga for nine years. “I’ve never even seen yoga clothes for men — I wouldn’t know where to look.”

Cameron Alborzian, a yogi, ayurvedic therapist and onetime model (seen in these pictures), used to teach at Integral Yoga and has seen guys show up in all kinds of stuff. “Once you go two or three times,” he said, “you see what other guys wear and figure out what you like.”
994 2009-01-29 BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) — The Swiss drug maker Novartis posted a 62 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit, helped by sales of blood pressure and cancer drugs, but said it expected 2009 to be increasingly difficult.

Profit hit $1.5 billion, but it missed forecasts as a stronger dollar weighed on its results.

The company, based in Basel, faces looming loss of patent protection for its top-selling Diovan blood pressure drug and tougher paths to markets for new products, and is trying to diversify and develop a clutch of new medicines to fill the revenue gap.

Novartis now expects group sales growing at a rate of about 5 percent in 2009 and drug sales at a rate of 5 to 10 percent.

The chief executive, Daniel L.Vasella, still expects some pain in 2009, particularly in animal health and nonprescription medicines, as consumers turn to stores’ own brands.

Novartis had mixed news on its new medicines on Wednesday. It said it recently submitted the lung disease drug QAB149 for European and United States approval and brought forward regulatory filing of ACZ885, to treat rare auto-inflammatory diseases, to December 2008 from a previously expected 2009.

But it had a setback when United States regulators asked for an expansion of a late-stage trial of the promising meningitis vaccine Menveo. Filing of Menveo for use in infants is now expected in 2011, Novartis said.

996 2009-01-29 Fans of the bold colors and graphic patterns on Orla Kiely’s high-end clothing and handbags will soon have a more affordable way to own her designs. In early February, Target is introducing a limited-edition collection of Orla Kiely (pronounced KY-lee) home décor products, for about $2.50 to $22. (Tablecloths with a green pear or brown floral motif are the most expensive; short plastic cups with orange or white designs are the cheapest.)

Whether she is designing mugs or handbags, Ms. Kiely said in an e-mail message, she keeps the same things in mind: “I try to think of the person loving them and why.” Her favorite items in the collection are the pear canisters (available in three sizes, shown behind Ms. Kiely in her south London living room, above, starting at about $15), which she likes because they are “simple” and “striking” and because of the way the wooden lid complements the vessel. Other products in the collection include melamine serving bowls (about $20 each) and side plates (about $3.50 each). Information: target.com.
997 2009-01-29 Regardless of when the switchover takes place, viewers with cable or satellite systems, and many others with digital televisions purchased after 2004, need not do anything in anticipation of the deadline, nor will they notice much of a change afterward. But for those older and low-income viewers like Ms. Clemmons who still use set-top rabbit ears or rooftop antennas to pull in images of “The Show” or “The Young and the Restless,” the switchover to digital television has often proven a bewildering and cumbersome burden.

That so many viewers here and around the country risk losing something as basic as a free television signal is a function, at least in part, of the government’s failure to anticipate that those most affected would be among the nation’s most frail and vulnerable. Further aggravating the confusion and uncertainty has been that a coupon program established by Congress to defray the cost of converter boxes — each American household is entitled to two $40 vouchers, which cover most, if not all, of the cost of the adaptors — ran out of money in early January, leaving hundreds of thousands of applicants to languish on a waiting list. (The program has already issued more than $1 billion worth of coupons.)

Ms. Clemmons, a woman whose slight frame and white mane belie her taste in — , and Nine-Inch Nails are her favorites — said she had made several attempts to call the government’s toll-free number in recent days to request a coupon and had not been able to get through.

Ultimately she received peace of mind from an unlikely source: Meals on Wheels. For several months now, drivers and volunteers for the Houston-area program have been delivering and installing digital converter boxes for its clients — as a side dish alongside the baked chicken and stewed peaches that are their usual fare. Ms. Clemmons’s turn came last week.

In Houston, which is the nation’s 10th-largest television market and whose flat topography makes it relatively easy to watch TV with only an antenna, the problem is particularly acute: 1 in 10 households remains out of compliance, by Nielsen’s estimates, ranking it behind only and .

Mindful of the need for such efforts, , the nonprofit advocacy group and publisher of Consumer Reports, is among those that lobbied Congress to put off the Feb. 17 deadline by four months. It has estimated the cost of replenishing the coupon program alone at nearly $1 billion, said Gene Kimmelman, vice president for international affairs. To defray the cost of the efforts by Meals on Wheels here, Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston, the social service organization that administers the program, appealed last year to congregants in churches and synagogues around the city to donate the converter coupons they may have already received; more than 1,500 people answered that call.

“After I heard about the process of what it would take for a person to get the coupon, and get the boxes, I was pretty livid,” said Bridget Samuel, chief operating officer for Interfaith. “I still go out on the routes making deliveries. Most of them are sitting in front of their TVs. They’re watching ‘Price Is Right.’ They’re watching ‘Judge Judy.’ That’s their company.”

Meals on Wheels is hardly the only entity in Houston, or around the country, that has been trying to bring viewers’ outdated equipment into compliance. The National Association of Broadcasters estimates that its stations and networks, have, collectively, allotted more than $1 billion worth of advertising time to raise public awareness.

The affiliate here, KHOU-TV, ran a series of tests during its local newscasts in which viewers were told that the analog signal was about to be temporarily replaced by the digital one — and that if their screens go to a test pattern, they should call the phone number listed to learn how to get up to date.

When KHOU and several other local stations ran the tests one day in December, nearly 14,000 viewers called the hot line in response. When the test was rerun on Jan. 6, 8,000 more calls were logged.

KHOU also joined with a local grocery chain, H-E-B, for a series of promotional events at which thousands of customers lined up to apply for coupons, and, if they already had them, to buy converter boxes. Most were able to do so at no personal expense, with H-E-B having priced the boxes at $40, the value of the coupons. (Other electronics retailers have been charging as much as $100.)

Through surveys of its nearly 4,000 clients, Meals on Wheels identified Ms. Clemmons as among those needing assistance. And so, on Jan. 21, Samantha Greenwood, the program’s assessment coordinator, arrived to install her converter box.

As it turned out, Ms. Greenwood couldn’t get the converter, which is about the size of a cable box and is connected to both the antenna and TV, to work, because of some wiring problems in the back of Ms. Clemmons’s Zenith. But she vowed that her husband, an engineer, would return well before the Feb. 17 deadline to solve the problem.

Ms. Clemmons, who risks losing access to “World News with ,” her favorite news program, said she would be waiting.

Earlier that morning Ms. Greenwood had fared better in the apartment of Ramona DeFore, a widow in the same building who is also 77. On her own Ms. DeFore had gotten a coupon and a box but had been baffled as to how to connect it to her Magnavox TV, a set so old she couldn’t remember when she had bought it.

After Ms. Greenwood made the connection successfully, Ms. DeFore was able to tune in Channel 2, the local affiliate, for the first time in years. “I think Phil is on 2,” she said, with obvious excitement, in reference to “Dr. Phil.” “I’ve missed him. I wish I had him a few years back, when I had my husband.”
998 2009-01-29 Still, he said, “I can assure you Starbucks is a company with solid, sound fundamentals and a plan to win.”

On Wednesday, the company also reported that net income in the first quarter fell to $64.3 million, or 9 cents a share, from $208.1 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year ago, a decline of 69 percent. Revenue fell 5.5 percent, to $2.6 billion from $2.77 billion in the quarter a year ago.

Sales at Starbucks stores open at least a year fell 9 percent in the first quarter. Over the three months that ended Dec. 28, 5 percent fewer people visited Starbucks stores and those who did spent 4 percent less.

Of the 700 layoffs, half will be at the company’s support center in Seattle, the company said. Of the 6,000 workers at the stores, Mr. Schultz said, Starbucks hoped that turnover and attrition would allow it to place many of the employees “elsewhere in its store organization.”

Most of the remaining closings will occur this year.

As part of the cuts, Mr. Schultz will reduce his salary to less than $10,000 a year, from $1.2 million.

“The decisions we make are about preserving the future of Starbucks,” he wrote in the letter to employees.

The company will take other cost-cutting measures, including renegotiating prices with landlords and suppliers, trimming vacation and personal days for hourly store employees and adjusting the way individual stores operate. For example, the company announced on Tuesday that stores where few customers order decaffeinated coffee after noon will no longer brew the coffee ahead of time and will instead make it on demand.

The cuts will increase projected savings this year $400 million to $500 million, the company said. While cutting costs, Starbucks is trying to appeal to newly value-conscious customers. It offers loyalty cards that provide discounts and over the holidays sold prepaid debit cards in bulk at a 20 percent discount at Costco. In March, Starbucks will introduce new breakfast combination meals “to challenge misconceptions about affordability,” Mr. Schultz said.

Some of the cost cuts are already beginning to bolster profit margins, noted Sharon Zackfia, a partner at William Blair & Company who covers the restaurant industry. Starbucks’s operating profit margins were 4.5 percent in the first quarter, far below past highs but up from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter.

Starbucks’ historically fast-paced growth made it hard to slow down when the recession began, Ms. Zackfia said. It nearly doubled the number of company-owned stores from 2005 to 2007.

“They were on full throttle into the recession, and when a company is growing like that and then the sales start to slow, you literally cannot brake hard enough,” Ms. Zackfia said.

Still, some Starbucks watchers say the chain’s problems started well before the economic crisis caused consumer spending to shrivel.

“Starbucks lost its cultural cache, its value, before everyone became conscious of the economic fallout,” said Bryant Simon, a professor of history and American studies at Temple University who is publishing a book about Starbucks this fall.

Customers were deserting Starbucks stores by the beginning of 2007, he said, because its emphasis on frothy, milky, sugary drinks hurt its image as an authentic coffee house.

Yet some analysts say that when the economy improves, Starbucks is poised to recover customers. Coffee consumption is rising among young people 18 to 25 years old, the first generation to drink more coffee outside the home than in it, Ms. Zackfia said.
999 2009-01-29 “We will see what Intel proposes to do and we will see what our response to that is,” Mr. Todd, the spokesman for Ms. Kroes, said.

The commission accuses Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers; by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines; and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost.

Europe’s investigation began in 2000 after a complaint by an Intel rival, Advanced Micro Devices, or A.M.D., which is also based in the United States. Last year, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Intel $25 million for its dealings with computer makers, and the Federal Trade Commission also opened a formal investigation.

Lawyers in Brussels now say they expect a ruling in the European case this year, and they say it could be one of the most important decisions that Ms. Kroes makes before her term expires at the end of October.

Even so, Intel’s tactics have created a procedural challenge. Ms. Kroes could make a decision without giving Intel a chance to respond, but that could leave the decision open to criticism on the grounds that it imperiled a large company’s rights of defense.

At the same time, Ms. Kroes needs a way to ensure that Intel and other companies are dissuaded from refusing to respond to accusations within a set deadline.

“Intel was given a deadline to respond,” said Tom McCoy, the executive vice president for legal affairs at A.M.D. “Intel should accept the consequences of its delaying tactics.”

During an interview on Wednesday, D. Bruce Sewell, the general counsel for Intel, declined to comment on what the company would do next. But on Tuesday, a spokesman for Intel said that the company was “still very concerned about the lack of certain documents in the case file that would help us conduct an effective defense.”

In its procedural appeal, Intel said the commission should have consulted evidence in a separate but related case in Delaware that Intel said had cleared it of guilt or blame for antitrust offenses. On Tuesday, Marc Jaeger, the president of the Court of First Instance, mostly rejected those concerns, but said that the commission still had the option to grant Intel extra time to respond so that the commission could “have access to all the information it needs.”
1000 2009-01-29 Global economic growth will reach 0.5 percent this year, the weakest pace since World War II, the monetary fund said. That is down from a 2.2 percent prediction in November.

The monetary fund also predicted that losses linked to bad mortgage loans in the United States could reach $2.2 trillion, weighing down banks worldwide. That far higher than the $1.4 trillion it anticipated in a November report.

“Unless stronger financial strains and uncertainties are forcefully addressed, the pernicious feedback loop between real activity and financial markets will intensify, leading to even more toxic effects on global growth,” the monetary fund said.

The picture in individual areas of the world was equally grim, in the monetary fund view. It foresees a 1.6 percent contraction of gross domestic product in the United States this year, and 2.6 percent in Japan. The 16-nation euro area will shrink 2 percent, it said.

Despite the ambitious goal, Mr. Wen left no doubt that the Chinese were feeling the ill effects of the financial-turned-economic crisis in earnest.

“We are facing severe challenges, including notably shrinking external demand, overcapacity in some sectors, difficult business conditions for enterprises, rising unemployment in urban areas and greater downward pressure on economic growth,” Mr. Wen said.

For now, though, governments are trying to hold things together with bank bailout schemes and stimulus packages in major economies that dwarf what has ever been tried.

Mr. Wen touted Chinese 4 trillion yuan stimulus package, equal to about 16 percent of gross domestic product over two years, as a large contribution to domestic demand after years of being the workshop of the world. The plan includes housing projects, rural development, railways and infrastructure, environmental protection, and recovery from last year’s devastating earthquakes.

He said that feasibility studies and other institutional arrangements ensured China would be able to put the plan in place effectively.

One theme that emerged early, in Davos this year, though, was that the globalization that brought national economies together in times of brisk growth demands that countries hammer out policies together on the downside. Otherwise, new government spending flows across borders, diluting its effects.

“We need to have coordinated fiscal response — stimulus,” said Justin Yifu Lin, senior vice president and chief economist at the World Bank. They are largely not coordinated.”

Mr. Wen largely agreed. “Only with closer cooperation and mutual help can we overcome the crisis,” he said.

Trevor Manuel, South Africa’s finance minister, cautioned that some fiscal plans may “come to nought” until countries figure out how to spend money sensibly.

“We see a lemming-like approach: trying to get to the precipice first without having any idea what that money will do,” Mr. Manuel said.

“I think we will have wealthy states indebted without much to show for it.”

And complaints about how national banking rescue plans are working also emerged.

“We feel that governments are encouraging banks to invest only in domestic assets,” the chairman of the Dogus Group in Turkey, Ferit Sehank, said. “As an advocate of globalization, I see this as a new way of protectionism.”

Echoing a widely held view in the global business community, Heizo Takenaka, director of the Global Security Research Institute in Keio, Japan, said fear of the future had taken over as the main driver of the crisis.

“The current situation is something more than a financial and economic crisis,” Mr. Takenaka said. “We face a confidence crisis. Once the confidence of crisis occurs, we need a strong government and central banks.”

The panickiest of the lot, Mr. Roach said, are American consumers, who are retrenching after a decade-long binge fed by inflated housing prices, and creating ripple effects — maybe they are more like tsunamis — across the world. Mr. Roach predicted that American consumers are only “20 percent into a multi-year” adjustment that will leave them much more frugal.

Chinese exports have already declined quarter-on-quarter, he said.

Shipments from Taiwan and Japan are also down. “As the Chinese economy has hit a wall, the rest of Asia has followed suit,” Mr. Roach said.

Mr. Manuel, of South Africa, said the economic crisis has hit his continent hard in the past year, as projects to develop natural resources, an area with much potential for Africa, are scaled back.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo alone, 48 mining projects are in various stages of abandonment, Mr. Manuel said.

“Look at Africa,” he said. “It’s a risk of decoupling, derailment, and abandonment altogether.”

Mr. Manuel and others said that as Western and Asian governments start borrowing heavily to spend for stimulus packages, they should allocate a portion to poorer countries.
1001 2009-01-29 BEIJING (AP) — Chinese authorities have begun a security sweep in Tibet ahead of the region’s most sensitive anniversary in years, with state media saying at least 81 people have been detained.

Tibet independence advocates said Wednesday that the sweep, announced as part of a campaign against crime, appeared aimed at intimidating Tibetans ahead of the 50th anniversary of the failed uprising that forced the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader, to flee into exile in India.

China has been preparing for the possibility of more unrest in Tibet since deadly rioting in the capital, Lhasa, last March led to the biggest protests among Tibetans in decades — and a major military crackdown.

China claims that Tibet has always been part of its territory, while many Tibetans assert that their Himalayan region was independent for centuries.

The Public Security Bureau of Lhasa began a “strike hard” campaign against crime on Jan. 18, with raids on residential areas, Internet cafes, bars and rented rooms, the state-run Tibetan Daily said in a Sunday report posted on the China Tibet News, a state news Web portal.
1002 2009-01-29 The chief executive of the Boeing Company said on Wednesday that the plane maker expected to cut a total of 10,000 jobs this year, about 6 percent of its work force.

The number includes 4,500 layoffs announced this month by Boeing’s commercial plane unit.

Boeing also reported an unexpected fourth-quarter loss Wednesday and forecast 2009 earnings well below Wall Street estimates as it grapples with a dip in demand for its planes while airlines feel the pain of recession.

Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said the cuts were necessary given the uncertainty over the country’s military budget and because the company was expecting more cancellations of plane orders.

But Boeing, which is struggling to recover from a two-month strike by its assembly workers, also was able to calm some investors, who had been braced for a worse outlook.

Boeing shares, which had fallen about 45 percent in the last 12 months, rose 2 cents, to $43.24.

“The guidance could have been much lower if Boeing had forecast a more conservative build rate for commercial airplanes in 2009,” an analyst at Macquarie Securities, Rob Stallard, said.
1003 2009-01-29 “The practice of initially obtaining a positive sample and subsequently of getting a negative result and not having” cleaned up the plant is illegal, said Michael C. Rogers, director of the division of field investigations at the food and drug agency.

A representative of the Peanut Corporation of America said she would respond to the accusations but did not.

The recall of peanut products is the latest in a series of increasingly severe food contamination scares involving , spinach, cantaloupes and other foods that have enraged legislators on Capitol Hill.

“I want to make this the year that we fix the nation’s system,” Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of and chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the food and drug agency, said in an interview. Ms. DeLauro called for the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation.

Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of and chairman of the House subcommittee on investigations, was one of three powerful House members who proposed legislation on Wednesday that would increase safety requirements for food makers and give F.D.A. officials greater authority and money to conduct inspections.

Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of and vice chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, likened food manufacturers to truant children who “can’t be relied on to report their own problems and correct them in a timely fashion, so we’re going to have to make them do it.”

The nation’s food-protection system relies largely on voluntary efforts by food makers to process food safely and agree to recall tainted foods when their own tests show problems. Government inspections are rare and sometimes inadequate.

Finger-pointing is common when problems occur. Representatives for McKee Foods and , for instance, both blamed contract manufacturers for failing to police the Peanut Corporation of America.

Libba Letton, a spokeswoman for Whole Foods, said the company carefully checked the paperwork for all its products.

“For the thousands of products we sell, that’s the extent we can go to,” Ms. Letton said. “The rest of it is up to the F.D.A. and to the manufacturer.”

Michael R. Taylor, a professor at and a food safety expert, said the peanut contamination demonstrated that the government must set stricter standards and spend more on enforcing them.

“If the government doesn’t enforce the standards, they won’t be met,” Mr. Taylor said.

F.D.A. officials said they relied on inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, a common situation.

State inspectors found rust that could flake into food and gaps in warehouse doors big enough for rodents to enter at the Peanut Corporation of America plant. But Oscar S. , Georgia’s assistant agriculture commissioner, described the violations as “minor.”

“There was really no red flag that gave us concern at the time,” Mr. Garrison said.

The recent federal inspection, however, concluded that the plant should never have been allowed to make peanut butter at all because it did not adequately separate raw and finished products, among other problems. Finished products should be stored far from raw materials to reduce the chances of re-contamination of the finished goods, according to food and drug agency rules.

Dr. Donald Zink, an F.D.A. food scientist, said state inspectors often visited different kinds of plants and might not know what was needed in a peanut butter facility. This same lack of specialization is true of many F.D.A. inspectors.

The agency found that the Georgia plant had mold on its ceiling and walls, and footlong gaps in its roof. The report also found that even after the company discovered that its peanut butter was contaminated, it did not clean its equipment.

In Blakely, Lawanda McGriff, manager of a restaurant, said that when the peanut plant was shut down because of the contamination, “we had approximately 50 people come down here trying to get hired.”

A local peanut farmer, Nelson Hattaway, said the closing would affect how much acreage he and others planted in May. “Now this salmonella thing means we’ll plant even less,” Mr. Hattaway said.
1004 2009-01-29 A Russian news report on Wednesday that is putting off its plan to deploy missiles near the Polish border raised speculation that the Kremlin is seeking ways to lower tensions with the now that a new administration has taken office.

The report, from the Interfax news agency, was attributed to an unidentified Russian defense official, and when contacted later in the day, other Russian defense and Foreign Ministry officials in Moscow would not confirm it or comment on it.

Interfax quoted the unidentified defense official as saying that “these plans have been suspended,” referring to the Kremlin’s proposal to base Iskander missiles in the western region of Kaliningrad and direct them toward .

The official was quoted as saying Russia had taken the step because was not “pushing ahead” with the Bush administration’s proposal to deploy an antimissile system in and the to defend against what the Bush administration had said was a threat from countries like .

Asked about the Interfax report, said through a spokesman that if confirmed, “it would be a positive step.”
1005 2009-01-29 For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets.

Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a “bad bank” to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way. It was Wall Street’s third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors.

The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

“Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, who added, “which is a bit of a stretch.”

Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34.
1006 2009-01-29 TOKYO — Japan said Wednesday that it would deploy its Maritime Self-Defense Force to protect Japanese commercial ships off the coast of Somalia. Yasukazu Hamada, the minister of defense, said he had ordered the force to prepare for deployment, possibly as early as March. Japan is expected to restrict its naval efforts, at least initially, to protecting Japanese-owned ships or vessels carrying Japanese goods or crew.

“The pirates in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia pose threats to Japan and the international community and are an issue that should be dealt with swiftly,” Mr. Hamada said, according to Kyodo News. The deployment, which would be considered a police action, is not expected to be as politically sensitive as other missions in recent years. Japan sent ground troops to Iraq as part of a humanitarian mission and its naval forces to the Indian Ocean on refueling duties as part of the war in Afghanistan.

The country’s pacifist Constitution restricts the activities of its military. Mr. Hamada said that a new law would have to be passed to authorize the maritime force to pursue the anti-piracy mission off Somalia. He did not offer details about the size of the mission.

Mr. Hamada did not indicate whether the Japanese would coordinate with other nations already operating in the Gulf of Aden. About 20 countries have sent ships to the gulf to escort commercial vessels and fend off the increasingly brazen pirates who operate from safe havens in Somalia.

The United States announced plans two weeks ago for a multinational anti-piracy coalition, and a flotilla from the European Union began patrols in the gulf last month.

1035 2009-01-30 If as President Obama says, he won, and has the necessary votes to get the legislation that he wants, what is the burning desire to have Republicans accept a plan that is contrary to their beliefs?

Mr. Obama gets his plans, and a definite distinction is drawn between what Democrats and Republicans stand for. And if his plan succeeds, then he and his party get all the credit, but conversely, should his tax-and-spend plan fail, he and his party will get all the blame.

Seems perfectly fine. And in two years, the people can judge the results of what each party has brought to the table and vote accordingly.

There was not one single Republican vote for the stimulus package as conceived by President Obama. The Republicans voted on an ideological basis, with no thought for those who need help the most. This is not new for them.

One might have thought that they learned something from the election, but they haven’t. They might also want Mr. Obama to fail, which means America fails, with them included in the sinking ship.

They were presented with a stimulus package that did the most for those who needed it the most, but it is not the poor and middle class they want to help. At least they are consistent in their misunderstanding of the present situation and of the American people.

The stimulus bill passed by the House has generated increasingly heated, but thoughtful, conflict among economists, and a rather less thoughtful “just say no” reaction from Republicans.

Given the need for speed — which all concerned seem to agree will magnify the “bang for the buck” — and the growing consensus around certain elements, I believe that Congress should act promptly to pass the approximately half of the House package that covers jobless benefits, food stamps, aid to states and the tax cuts to low- and middle-income citizens.

The transformative elements are no less vital, and should be taken up by Congress immediately thereafter. Because that spending will take more time to be effective, there could be additional — if limited — time for further debate.

By that time, the Treasury should be ready with a comprehensive plan for the banks’ continuing “toxic asset” problem, which should be carried out as nearly concurrently with the full stimulus as possible, for maximum effect on the confidence of everyone.

After reading Maureen Dowd’s Jan. 28 column, “Wall Street’s Socialist Jet-Setters,” I realized what has been bothering me all along about the recovery package: without some kind of sacrifice by every citizen and business, I feel far less inspired to roll up my own sleeves.

The vultures who ran our confidence over the cliff in the first place seem to bear little or no burden and seem to be working from an entirely different alphabet when it comes to rolling up their sleeves with the rest of Americans. They make no apparent sacrifice.

It doesn’t take a mathematician to see that this equation doesn’t work and might stir resentment, but it does explain my own fundamental uneasiness about the possible success of the recovery package.
1036 2009-01-30 William L. Kovacs, a vice president for environmental and regulatory issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said free-for-all federalism was bad for business and would lead to a “patchwork of laws impacting a troubled industry.” , Mr. Kovacs said, would have to produce different cars for different parts of the country, and the environmental protection agency would grow tremendously to meet the new regulatory burden.

Many liberal thinkers skeptical of states’ rights and state actions since the days of segregation have begun to see that the states, to use Justice Louis Brandeis’s words from the 1930s, can “serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”

Professor Issacharoff said states were often quicker than Washington to spot a problem when it emerged, and so “it may be the states that have the best initial take on it, and try different regulatory methods until we fasten on a single national solution.”

States have taken up the challenge of consumer protection, addressing issues like predatory lending well before the federal government took action, and often achieving reforms by suing the federal government to force it to enforce its laws and through legal settlements with industry. In October, 11 states reached an $8.4 billion settlement with in which it agreed to modify home to help people at risk of foreclosure. And in 2006, 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a $325 million settlement with the Ameriquest Mortgage company to change its policies.

Attorneys general also pressured major universities to adopt a code of conduct regarding their relationships with companies. , the former New York attorney general, achieved a settlement with the pharmaceutical company in 2004 in which it agreed to release more information about the risks to patients that had come out in clinical trials.

The Obama administration, then, is embracing a states’ rights movement that a liberal could love. “The pro-regulatory folks realized in the last eight years that the old line on federal power being the only good power wasn’t correct,” said , a law professor at the who was deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration and a former solicitor general of .

“It doesn’t mean you abandon the federal regulatory process — you don’t, of course,” Mr. Marshall said. “But you treat it as a floor and not a ceiling.”

He added, “The Obama administration is signaling that state regulations may very well complement federal regulations, and they can both work together to achieve important goals.”

Still, James E. Tierney, the director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Law School, cautioned against reading too much into a single presidential directive. “I don’t think we have a hallmark, sweeping view of states’ rights here,” Mr. Tierney said. He said “the Obama administration is going to take these one at a time” and “will be with the states as long as the states fit in with his view of the national interest.”

And Walter Dellinger, a solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said that the economic rise of the , compared with ’s, in the 1950s could be attributed in large part to the unified American market. Now Europe’s markets have unified, Mr. Dellinger noted. “There is a serious risk that if we decentralize regulations too much, we will, ironically, switch places with Europe,” he said.

Mr. Tierney, who is a former attorney general, said that while he was an advocate for state power, there were areas where federal power should nonetheless hold sway. “What the federal government ought to do,” he said, “is open the door to the states, and let the states enforce the law that the federal government promulgates.”

He added, “This is the opportunity to have the attorneys general join their own government instead of suing their own government.”
1037 2009-01-30 “The governor shares the city’s commitment to building affordable housing, and will continue to seek opportunities to maintain this longstanding commitment within the current fiscal climate,” Mr. Gordon said in a statement on Thursday.

Still, city officials and advocates for low-income housing are skeptical of the state’s plan. One city official said the governor’s proposal to issue bonds to increase the surplus in the joint fund seemed like an unwise financial move, and likened it to someone’s taking out a mortgage to pay for groceries.

Both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Thompson are opposed to the state’s plan to use the Battery Park City surplus, as are several advocates and nonprofit developers of low-cost housing. They said that the housing trust fund was a crucial “gap filler” at a time when the recession had all but crippled the financing of so-called affordable housing.

“While I recognize the need in these tough fiscal times to identify all available revenue sources, state and city budget challenges should be met without sacrificing this much-needed commitment to affordable housing,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.

The negotiations over the surplus also appear to have been marred by poor communication between City Hall and Albany, with each side saying it has had few details about the other’s intentions and plans.

Mr. Gordon said that when state budget officials reached out to the mayor’s budget office in November to discuss the state budget, and the use of the surplus in particular, no one informed the state that the city had earmarked the money. “We were not aware that there were intentions to use this particular money for affordable housing,” he said.

A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, said he was not aware of the conversations, but said, “We have been using the money for affordable housing for the last three years, and we never intended to change that.”

The Battery Park City Authority collects rent and payments from landlords in Battery Park City made in lieu of taxes. After paying expenses, the authority has for years put its surplus into a Joint Purpose Fund, which is held by the authority and made up of annual surpluses from previous years. In October, it had a total of $215 million, according to authority documents. It must be used for “purposes unanimously decided upon” by the mayor, the city comptroller and the governor, who controls the authority, the documents state.

The city has already used part of the surplus for housing. In 2005, the mayor and Mr. Thompson called for financing 4,500 units of low-cost housing by using $130 million in Battery Park City surplus money, a plan that Gov. George E. Pataki and the authority’s board approved in 2006.

About $100 million of the $130 million has been used so far for low-cost housing, helping to finance more than 2,350 units around the city.

The idea for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund came about as part of negotiations with the Bloomberg administration, the City Council, housing advocates and real estate developers to revamp the 421a program, a popular tax break for housing developers, to encourage the construction of thousands of apartments for low-income residents. Gov. Eliot Spitzer signed the legislation overhauling the program in 2007.

The new program established the fund — the city said it intended the fund to have $400 million — to develop low- and moderately-priced housing, primarily in the city’s 15 poorest neighborhoods. But the negotiations and the legislation did not specify a source of financing. The city proposed using the Battery Park City surplus. Mr. Thompson had agreed in theory to it, and city officials said that the governor at the time, Mr. Spitzer, had also supported the idea.

But the city was slow to finalize the financing arrangements of the trust fund in a document, which has further complicated the fight over the surplus.

Adam Weinstein, president of Phipps Houses, a nonprofit group that owns and manages low-cost housing in the city, said that he had been relying on financing from the trust fund.

“It’s troubling news,” Mr. Weinstein said. “It’s troubling for projects that are more affordable and therefore rely more heavily on this funding.”
