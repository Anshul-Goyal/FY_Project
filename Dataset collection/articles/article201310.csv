At least four deaths were attributed to the weather, including that of a South Dakota man who collapsed while clearing snow. Cattle ranchers in western South Dakota were reporting losing between 20 percent and 50 percent of their herds, and early estimates suggest the region may have lost 5 percent or more of its cattle.'"
"'77','2013-10-08','A crane malfunctioned on Monday at the same Midtown Manhattan high-rise that was the scene of a crane accident during Hurricane Sandy.

Around 9:30 a.m., the crane, at 157 West 57th Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, was being used to hoist a concrete counterweight labeled at 13,500 pounds when it stopped working properly, leaving the load hanging about 30 stories above the street for several hours.

A one-block stretch of 57th Street was closed to vehicular traffic. Eventually, workers were able to slowly lower the load down to the ground, and about 4 p.m., the street was reopened.

The authorities had said they were working the fix the problem as quickly as possible because winds were expected to pick up later in the day and New York City was under a tornado watch.

The crane is at the same 74-story luxury skyscraper where, one year ago, an 80-mile-per-hour gust of wind during Hurricane Sandy almost sent the boom of a crane crashing down to the streets below.

After the storm, a new crane was erected so work could continue on the building, one of the tallest construction projects in North America, where top-floor apartments have sold for around $100 million.'"

Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said that 13 states use pentobarbital for executions and that every execution but one over the past two years in the United States used pentobarbital. Gov. Jay Nixon on Oct. 11 halted a scheduled execution in part because the European Union was weighing export limits on propofol if it was used in executions. Propofol is mostly made in Europe. Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, halted all executions until the issue was resolved. States have been scrambling to find alternatives in recent years because manufacturers do not want their products used in executions.'"
