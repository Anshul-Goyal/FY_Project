"'19','2015-04-07','Best player: Brad Eldred of Florida, who hit 251 minor league home runs from 2002 to 2012 and had four brief stints in the majors, hit 37 homers for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp last year.

The horse, Pompey II, 13, was patrolling East New York with Officer Luis Ramos around 12:47 p.m. when the dog charged at them in front of a house at 490 Essex Street. The dog bit Pompey II, causing puncture wounds, but Officer Ramos was able to keep the stallion under control.

Another mounted officer, Laurene Bove, responded on her horse, Limerick, prompting the dog to retreat into its yard.

The dog had been in the yard surrounded by an eight-foot wooden fence and a four-foot chain-link fence, the police said. Investigators believe that when the dog saw Pompey II, it pushed through the wooden fence and jumped the chain-link fence.

The dog was taken to Animal Care and Control, where it will stay until the police finish their inquiry. No charges were filed against the owner Wednesday.

Pompey II was returned to his stable in Brighton Beach, where he was to be treated by a veterinarian. The police said he was expected to make a full recovery. He will be allowed a few days of rest, and will receive a few extra apples and carrots.'"
