"'25','2015-06-05','Analysts predict that the jobs report will show that employers added 227,000 jobs last month, on top of the 223,000 added in April. They also forecast that the unemployment rate will remain 5.4 percent, a seven-year low.

The number of Americans receiving unemployment aid fell to just below 2.2 million, the fewest since November 2000. That is a small fraction of the 8.5 million unemployed. Some of the unemployed have used all of their benefits, while others, like recent college graduates searching for work, are not eligible for aid.

Worker productivity fell 3.1 percent in the first quarter, a bigger drop than the 1.9 percent decline estimated a month ago, the Labor Department said. Labor costs rose at a 6.7 percent rate in the first quarter, faster than the 5 percent increase first estimated.

Growth hit a soft patch in the winter with the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, contracting in the January-March quarter. But economists say they believe that growth and productivity are rebounding. Still, productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has been weaker in recent years, and economists are split on the reasons.

Economists say they expect the overall economy to rebound in the April-June quarter as the effects of a harsh winter and other temporary factors fade.

Productivity is the crucial determinant for rising living standards. Increases in efficiency allow employers to pay higher wages based on greater output without having to raise the price of their products, which can set off inflation. A slowing of productivity growth that has been evident recently has caused concern, and economists are divided over whether this is a short-term development or a longer-term problem.

For all of 2014, productivity grew a modest 0.7 percent, even less than the 0.9 percent gain in 2013. From 1995 to 2000, productivity rose at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent, reflecting in part the strength the economy received from the Internet boom. But since 2000, productivity has slowed to an annual rate of 2.1 percent.

The Federal Reserve watches productivity and labor costs closely to see if inflation pressures are intensifying. The long-term increase in labor costs has been well below the level that would set off inflation alarms at the central bank. The annual rates of increase have averaged just 0.8 percent since 2000, significantly below the 2.8 percent average gains from 1995 to 2000.'"

The company had said this month that it expected to price its shares at $14 to $16. At the midpoint of the new price range, Fitbit would be valued at nearly $3.7 billion.

Fitbit also said on Tuesday that its existing shareholders intended to sell additional shares in the offering. The company now plans to sell 22.4 million shares, and its existing shareholders plan to sell 12.1 million shares, up from 7.5 million shares, according to the filing.

Fitbit filed for the I.P.O. last month.

The company, founded in 2007 and based in San Francisco, sells wearable devices that allow consumers to track their physical activity, heart rate and calories burned. Its products range from a simple activity tracker to a more complex sports watch.

The company reported revenue of $745.4 million in 2014.

"'86','2015-06-23','Starvation is a real threat during an extended pandemic, but it is very hard to predict when and where it will start, researchers report in an unusual new study.

A severe outbreak could lead to widespread starvation as food distribution breaks down. A pandemic could leave too few farmhands, truck drivers and warehouse workers healthy enough to work, along with dwindling numbers of people available to maintain the electric grid, water supplies, and phone and computer networks.

Researchers at EcoHealth Alliance, a New York research group, used mathematical models to gauge the effects under various scenarios. Their study was published this month in The Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences.

Assuming a pandemic hit the United States in seasonal waves over at least two years and caused work absenteeism averaging 20 percent, rather than substantial deaths, almost no one would starve after three months, the researchers concluded.

In a little over a year, however, half the country would be starving, said Andrew G. Huff, a specialist in food supply protection and co-author of the new study.

The 1918 Spanish flu is the closest historical parallel, and death by starvation was not widespread in the United States then, Dr. Huff said. But he noted that it did occur in a few remote areas, was common in Alaskan Inuit villages, and was part of a broad crisis in parts of Europe torn by World War I.

Although starvation resulting from Ebola was widely predicted in West Africa last year, especially in quarantined rural areas, it was averted by aid agencies distributing food.'"

"'101','2015-06-27','Since General Motors began recalling 2.6 million older small cars with defective ignition switches last year, federal regulators have been criticized for their failure to thoroughly investigate the problem despite receiving clear warnings from vehicle owners.

Now, there are signs that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under a new administrator, Mark R. Rosekind, is quicker to look into potential defects based on owner complaints.

The agency recently opened five investigations into vehicles made by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mazda after receiving complaints from worried owners about problems with brakes, airbags and anti-collision systems. In one case, the investigation begun after the agency received six complaints on its website.

An investigation can often lead to a recall.

The largest inquiry involves about 630,000 Jeep Wranglers from the 2007-12 model years after more than 200 owners complained about the airbag warning light illuminating, indicating the safety device would not work in a crash. There were no reports of accidents.
