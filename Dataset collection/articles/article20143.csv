Generous pinch of salt, or to taste

1. Stir together oats, amaranth seeds, salt and raisins in a medium-size microwave-proof bowl. Bring 2/3 cup water to a boil and pour over mixture. Add maple syrup and stir together, then cover bowl with a plate and leave it out on the counter overnight. (You can refrigerate if you prefer.)

2. In the morning, place bowl (still covered by the plate) in the microwave and cook for 2 minutes on 100 percent power. Remove from the microwave and very carefully remove plate from top of bowl. (Bowl will be hot, and steam will rise from cereal.) Stir the mixture. If it is not yet thick, cover again and return to microwave. Cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, until the mixture is no longer watery.

3. Transfer to a serving dish. Coarsely grate apple over cereal and stir in. Drizzle on more maple syrup and, if desired, add a little milk, and walnuts or almonds.'"

But last month, the association gave him a Champion of Public Broadcasting award for restoring previously cut state funding to support public broadcasting in his first budget as governor.

State funding for public television, which nose-dived after the recession, has experienced an uptick in the last two years.

Funding is still off sharply from the 2008 fiscal year, when 38 states appropriated about $277 million for public television stations or statewide networks, according to statistics collected by the National Educational Telecommunications Association and released by the television group.

For 2014, 35 states set aside about $191.5 million. That was up about $10 million since last year, and a gain of $13.5 million since the appropriations hit a low of $178 million in the 2012 fiscal year, said Patrick Butler, chief executive of the Association of Public Television Stations.'"
