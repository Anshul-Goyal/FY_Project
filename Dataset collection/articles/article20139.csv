"'70','2013-09-09','I object to how this essay characterizes the political environment at Yale-N.U.S. College, which opened last month in Singapore as a joint venture between Yale and the National University of Singapore.

The guiding principle has been that a campus life full of critical discussion and debate is a central part of the educational experience. Students are already actively engaged in discussion of controversial topics inside the classroom and throughout the campus. They are also free to join off-campus branches of political parties. They may gather freely within the college facilities to hear speakers and express views openly. Under Singaporean law, demonstrations in public outdoor spaces do require advance notice and a special permit.

Paradoxically, Mr. Sleeper says he supports cooperating with authoritarian regimes on technical and professional education, but would have us restrict undergraduate liberal education to societies meeting his political standards. How does he expect those countries to become more open if their students are denied the benefits of a liberal education and the attendant discussion of political issues on campus?

While Mr. Sleeper seems to want to keep a liberal education from any supposed contamination by contact with different political regimes, progress actually depends on encounters with the unfamiliar, which are at the heart of a liberal education.
