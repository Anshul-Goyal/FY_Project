Mr. Setiawan, 36, was charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime.

Mr. Setiawan, of Bellerose, Queens, was a police officer for two years before resigning in 2007; he was last assigned to a precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn. The reason he left the department was not immediately clear.

In the years since, the police said, Mr. Setiawan has been arrested six times, though the charges against him were sealed, an indication that they may have been dropped.

The anti-Semitic messages began appearing before 9 p.m. on Saturday around 14th Avenue in Brooklyn. The police said about four buildings and 15 private cars were marked.'"

"'187','2014-05-31','Los Alamos National Laboratory will not be able to meet a deadline for getting toxic waste from decades of building nuclear bombs off its northern New Mexico campus before wildfire season peaks, the Department of Energy said Friday. In a statement, the department said it has notified the New Mexico Environment Department that it cannot move the last 57 of the thousands of barrels of waste containing items like contaminated gloves and tools until officials are sure it is safe. A canister shipped from Los Alamos to the Waste Isolation Pilot Project has been linked to a radiation release Feb. 14 at the underground repository in southeastern New Mexico. Officials are investigating whether hundreds of other barrels from Los Alamos that are stored at the West Isolation Pilot Plant, Los Alamos and in West Texas are at risk of releasing radiation. The waste was packed with cat litter to absorb moisture. Officials are trying to determine whether a switch from inorganic to organic litter is to blame for a chemical reaction that caused an accident that contaminated 22 workers and indefinitely shuttered the plant. The agreement for removal of the waste by June 30 was reached after a large wildfire lapped at the edge of lab property three years ago.'"
