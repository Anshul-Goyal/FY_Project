The complaint listed violations of federal law in 14 states involving more than 60 workers and 34 stores. It said Walmart fired 19 employees for taking part in strikes and demonstrations against the company. Other employees were given verbal warnings or faced other disciplinary action. In some cases, according to the complaint, the company spied on employees.

The complaint said that twice on national television, as well as in statements in stores in California and Texas, the company unlawfully threatened employees with reprisals if they took part in strikes or protests. Some of those protests took place around Black Friday, the big shopping day that follows Thanksgiving, in 2012 and others the next year.

A union-backed group called Our Walmart had organized protests at about 1,000 Walmart stores in 46 states. Despite the threats, the protests drew thousands of employees seeking higher wages.

More than 60 supervisors and one corporate officer were named in the complaint.

Walmart said the employees were not fired for participating in an outside group. It said most of the firings were for breaking attendance policies.'"

"'110','2014-01-17','WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Japan-based Koito Manufacturing Co Ltd has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of conspiring to fix auto parts prices and will pay $56.6 million in criminal fines, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.

Koito and other unnamed companies conspired to push up the prices of lighting fixtures and lamp ballasts used to make headlights, tail lights, brake lights and turn signals. The parts were sold to automakers in the United States and elsewhere, the department said in a statement.

Koito has also pledged to cooperate with the department's ongoing probe.

Law enforcement authorities in the United States and elsewhere have brought charges related to price fixing of more than 30 types of car parts, including seat belts, radiators, windshield wipers, air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.

Including Koito, 24 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in connection with the U.S. probe. Twenty-six executives have been charged.'"

"'169','2014-01-27','1. Heat oil over medium heat in a large heavy casserole or skillet, or in an earthenware casserole set on a flame tamer. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until golden, about 10 minutes. If they begin to stick to the pan add a generous pinch of salt. Add another generous pinch of salt and the peppers and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute. Add the cabbage, chiles, coriander seeds, cumin and caraway and cook, stirring, until cabbage has wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the harissa or cayenne, salt and pepper, stir together and add the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, cover partially, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring from time to time, until tomatoes have cooked down and the mixture is thick and fragrant, about 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in all but 2 teaspoons of the parsley or cilantro, taste and adjust seasonings.

Note: If you are using an earthenware casserole, the cooking times will be longer. It will take about 10 minutes for the peppers to soften, and 30 to 40 minutes for the mixture to cook down.

2. With the back of your spoon, make 6 depressions in the vegetables. Break an egg into each depression. Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the eggs are set. Sprinkle the eggs with salt, pepper and the remaining parsley and serve.

Advance preparation: This can be made a few days ahead through Step 1, and it will taste even better on the second day.

While that is unlikely to be a huge business soon for Dell, it lends credibility and muscle to what has been a growing effort to dislodge these incumbents through cheaper, easier-to-build equipment. If Dell and others can do that, a result would be lower costs at the large data centers run by Google, Facebook and large banks and companies. Cheaper networking could also make the Internet even more ubiquitous.'"
