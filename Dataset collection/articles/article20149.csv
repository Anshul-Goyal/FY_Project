"'26','2014-09-05','Wawrinka won 33 points in the opening set but hitting two huge forehands winners, inside-in down the line, in the second game of the set was all that mattered. The Swiss finished the with an ace down the middle in the ad court to take the early advantage.

Nishikori had five break points in the second set and ultimately converted on one when Wawrinka double faulted at 5-6, 30-40, to level the match. Nishikori had only won 55 percent (6 of 11) of his first serve points in the opening set, but locked down to win 91 percent (20 of 22) in the second set.

The third set was one of the best sets the tournament has seen.

Nishikori stole it, 9-7, in the tiebreaker after failing to convert a set point with Wawrinka serving at 2-5, ad out. Nishikori cooked a forehand down the line into the net that he should have taken cross court.

Nishikori played a horrible game at 5-3, missing a tweener off a lob at 15-30 with Wawrinka standing behind his own baseline. It should have been a forehand, but showtime unfortunately took over.

Wawrinka had another break point at 5-5, 30-40, but pushed a wide backhand into the net from very deep behind the baseline. It was one of the big questions of the match: why did Wawrinka play so deep against an opponent he had to attack?

Wawrinka by 5-3 in the tiebreaker and then by 7-6 to serve for the set. But Nishikori stepped up with an insane backhand winner down the line that should only be attempted once every 100 years. Wawrinka missed a backhand return long on the next point and Nishikori had stolen the third set.

The fourth set was an emotional letdown for the players after such a spectacular third, and they motored along to an eventual tiebreaker with only one break-point opportunity for the set. Wawrinka raced to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker before closing it out, 7-5, when Nishikori netted a backhand return on set point.

The fifth set was similar to the fourth, and Nishikori finally broke with Wawrinka serving at 4-5, 30-40.

Matches like these come along once in a while. The winner moves on, and you wish the loser could as well.'"

The proposal seeks to build an array of needed resources on the parking spaces that surround New York City Housing Authority projects in transit-rich areas. As reasonable as that sounds in the abstract, the devil will be in the details.

Housing authority residents have suffered from the withdrawal of so much government support that trust is lacking. A huge community-building effort, combined with real evidence of change in how the authority responds to resident requests, is required before fruitful negotiations over land use can begin. Active, informed community boards could play a useful role in bringing residents and planners together to find common ground.
