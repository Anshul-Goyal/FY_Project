"'131','2014-08-26','On the third deuce of the 5-5 game, Kyrgios hit a spectacular runaround forehand winner that sparked his game and the crowd, and led to the first break of the match. Kyrgios led by 40-0 serving at 6-5 and surprisingly double-faulted twice before forcing a backhand return error at 40-30 to seal the set.

Kyrgios broke Youzhny in the opening game of the second set and served consecutive aces in the next game to consolidate the break. He led, 4-2, and it was almost going too easily. The hot conditions looked as if they were taking a toll on Youzhny as he threw in an 87-mile-per-hour first serve in the 2-4 game.

Just when it felt very comfortable, Kyrgios got loose. He played his first bad service game serving at 4-3 in the second set, missing a short forehand to lose the game and his composure. As soon as he missed the forehand on break point, he took a ball from his pocket and launched it out of the stadium.

Kyrgios held things together well enough to reach the tiebreaker and raced to a 5-1 lead before winning, 7-4. He led two sets to love, but a disastrous third set was looming.

He was broken in the opening game of the third set and was clearly frustrated at the dogged ad court tactics of Youzhny, the errors that were piling up, and an injury to his left arm, which forced him to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters two weeks ago. Trailing by 2-4 in the third, Kyrgios lost his service game at love with almost no opposition.

Kyrgios was broken relatively easily at the beginning of the fourth set, and his attitude went south. He was penalized a game for bad language. He responded by hitting two angry aces and two unreturned serves in the next game at 1-3. Kyrgios finally broke back for 5-5 with a backhand winner on break point and got his emotions under control, losing only one point in the fourth-set tiebreaker.

He hit 68 winners for the match with 26 aces and 22 forehand winners. Kyrgios hit 277 forehands for the match and 214 backhands, but the forehands flowed much more freely toward the end.

Kyrgios will play the 49th-ranked Andreas Seppi of Italy in the second round.'"

"'138','2014-08-27','Pinch-hitter Ike Davis blasted a tiebreaking, three-run homer off Seth Maness in the eighth inning Tuesday night, lifting the Pittsburgh Pirates over the visiting St. Louis Cardinals, 5-2.

The Pirates won after Andrew McCutchen left in the fifth inning because of discomfort in his left ribs. Recently on the disabled list because of a rib problem, McCutchen ran into the wall earlier in the game.

Davis sent a 2-2 pitch from Maness deep over the fence in right-center for his ninth home run of the season and his third as a pinch-hitter.

ORIOLES 4, RAYS 2 Jonathan Schoop singled in the go-ahead run in the sixth inning and Caleb Joseph had two runs batted in as host Baltimore beat fading Tampa Bay. The Rays have lost seven of 10 since reaching the .500 mark on Aug. 15.

PHILLIES 3, NATIONALS 2 Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf homered and Carlos Ruiz drove in the go-ahead run with an eighth-inning sacrifice fly to lead host Philadelphia to a victory over Washington.'"
