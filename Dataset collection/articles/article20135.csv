The items included a ricin-tainted dust mask, the affidavit said. Mr. Dutschke used the Internet to buy castor beans, from which ricin is derived, the affidavit said.

The recovery since the recession that ended in 2009 has been the weakest in decades, as measured by the change in gross domestic product.

"'45','2013-05-04','Pictures From the Week in Business'"
"'46','2013-05-04','The business segment consists of private fixed investment in everything from buildings to computers, but excludes residential construction. That is included in the consumer category, which also includes personal consumption expenditures. The government category includes spending by all three levels of government, federal, state and local.

Business investment in the first quarter of this year was 21 percent higher than it had been in the quarter when the economy bottomed.

That was not quite as large an increase as followed the 1991 bottom, but it is more rapid than the increases that occurred during the recoveries that began in 1982 and 2001.

Corporations as a group are doing well. Corporate profits, as a percent of G.D.P., rose to record post-World War II levels in 2012, and the effective income tax rate on those profits remains lower than it was in any of the past recoveries, according to government estimates.

The government has not yet estimated first-quarter corporate profits.

After past recessions, there has often been an immediate explosion in consumer spending as pent-up demand comes to the fore, and as the housing industry rebounds rapidly. That did not happen this time, in large part because of the nature of the boom in the 2000s, which included excessive investment in houses and consumers taking on debt to support their consumption. The resulting hangover has depressed the recovery in consumer spending to just 8.6 percent after 15 quarters, well below the pace of any of the previous three rebounds.

That is starting to change, however. The pace of growth in nonresidential investment is slowing, but residential investment is starting to take off. And personal consumption expenditures climbed at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in more than two years.

Whether those gains can continue, as the payroll tax increase and the federal government sequester increase their impact, remains to be seen.

The government sector has been shrinking almost continually since the end of the recession. The decline in state and local government seems to have begun to slow down, but the decline in federal spending appears to be picking up and is likely to continue to be a drag on the American economy.'"
