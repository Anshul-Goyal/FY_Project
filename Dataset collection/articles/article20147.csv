"'100','2014-07-19','INDUSTRIAL production around the world plunged after the Great Recession began, and in most advanced economies has yet to fully recover. But that is not the case in many emerging economies, with production hitting new highs.

The United States this week reported that industrial production, excluding construction, rose 0.2 percent in June and was up 4.3 percent from a year earlier. That is a faster rate than any other major advanced economy has shown recently, but it pales next to the rates of growth in such countries as China and India.

The accompanying charts show the change in levels of industrial production since the end of 2007, as the recession was beginning in the United States. The latest report indicates that production in the United States was 3 percent higher in June than it was in December 2007. That is, however, largely because of increased oil and gas production. Overall manufacturing output is still a bit below the pre-recession levels, although production in the motor vehicle industry has been strong.

The Netherlands government compiles industrial production reports from 27 advanced economies and 54 developing economies around the world, and computes international averages. Its latest report shows that world production in April was almost 12 percent higher than it had been at the end of 2007, but that production in the advanced economies was nearly 5 percent lower than it had been.

In the emerging economies, production was up by more than a third from the 2007 level, primarily because of the performance of Asian countries, where production is up by more than 60 percent.

China releases data only on annual changes, making any calculation of month-to-month changes hard to estimate, but it appears that its production has approximately doubled from the 2007 level. In India, production is up nearly a quarter since the recession began.'"

Polio also has been detected in two Iraqi children in Baghdad, and it paralyzed one of them in April, the report said. Although 25 million children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated multiple times in seven Middle East countries under an emergency campaign, the report said many Syrian children missed out because of fighting and restrictions on distributing medical aid. The report said 765,000 Syrian children under 5 live in hard-to-reach areas. Polio, which is spread by feces, was thought to be nearly eradicated a few years ago, but it has spread in some fragile countries this year. In May, the W.H.O. declared a global health emergency because of the resurgence, imposing travel restrictions on Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon because the virus had spread from those countries to neighbors.'"
