The company posted net income of $4.95 billion for the quarter on revenue of $56.6 billion. The company earned $5.25 billion on revenue of $55.66 billion during the same quarter last year. The latest earnings amounted to $2.57 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.69 a share, on average, according to FactSet. Higher oil prices in the United States and abroad, and higher natural gas prices in America also helped bolster revenue. But higher operating expenses and exploration costs offset those gains.'"
